The Sound of Music," OMG I love it<3
","The Sound of Music is AMAZING! I don't know what it was that made me love the movie after hating it for so many years, but something definitely happened! I'm 14 and I never thought that I could like older movies such as this one. Well, I thought wrong! I adore this movie!! Anyway...the whole movie is beautiful. The places, the actors, the songs, etc. It's one of those good romance movies. Actually, it's the way a romance movie should be. In movies today, they show two people who are obviously interested in each other, then the next morning they're in bed together. That's horrible!! But in the Sound of Music, you can watch the love slowly unfold. You'd never really know it until a little later in the movie, but it gets obvious after a while.I was lucky enough to go on the Sound of Music tour in Austria when I went on vacation in Germany. It was a 4 hour tour, but well worth my time. Although at the time I hated it and wanted nothing to do with it. I actually have my picture in front of the pavilion type thing where Liesl and Rolfe sang 'Sixteen Going on Seventeen' and where the Captain and Maria sing 'Something Good'. =]I highly recommend this movie to every single age group out there! Such a good musical and it's even got a little humor. So if you like romance, music, and comedy, then you're gonna love this movie! And let me tell you a little secret...if you're emotional ((like me)) and you get into this movie enough, you just might cry at the end. Or maybe intermission. Ha.",10,1,7,18 February 2007
