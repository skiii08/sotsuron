The Ring," A huge let down
","I remember when I first watched the original Japanese version of this film on TV. I found it very atmospheric, very scary and extremely compelling. So when I found out that they were going to remake it I was very excited.....And then I watched it.This movie had no atmosphere whatsoever. It was frankly boring, (I almost feel asleep in the cinema). They cut out some of the story, and changed other bits of it. If you've read the book or seen the Japanese version of this film, don't bother. But if you haven't, you may find it entertaining. ** out of *****.",5,1,2,10 June 2003
