Blade Runner 2049," Beautiful, slow and boring
","Beautiful but excruciatingly slow and boring. I can't help but wonder what a faster-paced, same story, one hour less version of this movie would have looked like. Could have been a pretty good movie.",5,19,39,7 February 2018
Passengers," Great movie, disappointing ending
",I really enjoyed the movie but the ending was really disappointing. The 'revive' scene is one we have seen a hundred times before in so many other movies. I think it would have made a great ending for him to die there and Aurora ending up waking up someone else as she faces the same situation as Jim's at the beginning of the movie.,7,1,2,16 March 2017
Dunkirk," Single page script and few dialogues
","What a weird movie. The script should be able to fit on a single page and there are very few dialogues (and certainly none that you would remember). Direction is okay for an otherwise quite boring movie. The only thing that saves this movie is that it's not too long, which makes it not too painful to watch.",6,8,12,14 August 2017
