Sucker Punch," Feel the Punch
","I have been a fan to Mr. Zack since the movie 300. A total of 5 years in making will be paid off when you watch this one. I love the gradient colors, stunning CGI and video game based hack and slash stunts. Plot is simple, but the execution is tough. Zack had done a beautiful job in presenting this movie with his own glamor style. Emily does justice to the character with her cheesy looks and decent acting. The rest of the crew is apt to their roles. Music is very nice which will mix up to the scenes. Overall an average story with great screenplay with gorgeous visuals which makes you to stick to your seat. A brave 8/10 for this baby doll.",8,50,98,17 March 2011

","I got a chance to view this grandeur on a premiere show and it is one of the the best movie so far in the last 25 years. Absolutely gorgeous and visually spellbinding! The long awaited dream for James came true with this movie and he has put everything to make it a visual feast. James has kept his promise to revolutionize the cinema by mixing up the CGI characters along with the real characters.There were some experiments done in the past but this movie takes the cinema into a different dimension. As James has already announced, this movie concept is influenced by Hindu mythology. The incarnation process which is being shown here is mentioned as 'Parakaya Pravesam' in the older mythical ages. Para - Alien/Other , Kaya - Body , Pravesam - Enter/incarnate. So totally, it is the process of entering into an alien/other body through some well built process.The entire cast is well placed and every one has done justice to their roles. The concept art of Pandora is absolutely the best artistic creation in the movie history. The depth of creatures in the Pandora is really amazing. James awaited very long for this movie as there no proper technical enhancements at the point of time he thought about the movie. Thanks to UBISoft Montreal studio for a great CGI engine which delivers life like characters.The aliens are so beautifully designed, you will not get an impression that they are apart from human world. The direction is so great that at the end of movie, you cannot believe that you have spent 164 minutes in the theater ! Music by James Horner greatly mixes up with the story line and will add up to the magic.The only bad point of this movie is the story, which is kept very simple and predictable. But that wont stop me from giving a 10 for this brilliant piece of movie.Go watch it in 3D!",10,5,11,23 December 2009
Inception," Absolutely Flawless!!!
","This movie is like a flawless diamond in the cinema history. Nolan has done a brilliant piece of work in bringing out the shine of this gem. This movie is based on the notion, 'What you see is what you believe in reality. What you believe is what you see in your dreams!'.The plot is astounding and the screenplay is extraordinary. All the actors get completely into the movie and you feel as if they are real professional extractors. Leo has delivered a great performance and will be remembered as Dom Cobb for a very long time. Ellen, Ken, Joseph, Dilip and the rest of the team gave a very good performance, which will never allow you to miss a single frame.The story is very complex in nature, but Nolan has portrayed the screenplay in a splendid fashion. So far the best of his movies and definitely deserves the Oscar for best story and direction. We can say this one is like a Cullinan shining in his crown.Music by Hans Zimmer will keep you in the real dreamy world. Not to mention the CGI in this movie, which are quite realistic and it is hard to tell the difference between the virtual and reality. Production values are top notch, which makes the audience to feel the brilliance of the movie.I will give away 10/10 for this splendor. I can say one of the best movies in the decade so far. This one should be definitely watched in theater to catch the real feeling of the movie.",10,3,7,19 July 2010
