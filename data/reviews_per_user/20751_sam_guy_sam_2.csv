Resident Evil: Afterlife," Somewhat Disappointed
","The movie was quite OK , absolutely worth a watch ,some quite good scenes and with Fusion 3D camera it was a visual treat but it wasn't quite what i expected. I went in hoping to squeal with delight but never happened so didn't meet the expectations even the 'hammer monster' didn't go nowhere near nemesis or pyramid head from Silent hill, besides there were some loopholes in the story like where did the hammer guy come from and who built him the hammer???? It was more on the action and less on horror. I watched the movies at noon and it was gone till evening , no after taste unlike other movies in the series.You can watch it and not be disappointed if you don't go expecting Resident Evil 2.",6,2,6,12 September 2010
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Worth the wait, Exceeds the hype and expectations. Makes you lust for Justice League movie.
","The critics must be crazy if not paid by marvel, just saw the movie in 3D and it was worth the wait and exceeded the hype. It was a Grand Scale movie, one of the rare times that books come alive on screen , comics in this case. Every scene was perfection, every character born for their roles. At the risk of sounding like a fan boy,( i am 30 years old) i dare to say that this movie is what a superhero movie should look like. It makes all the avengers movie look like child play in comparison. I have seen all the marvel movies in theater being an avid comic book reader but never have i seen the audience so engrossed in a movie before. i saw women crying, people clapping and cheering and i myself first time in my life whistled when the three came together on screen the first time. It's the movie we needed and the movies not many deserve. Amazing soundtrack, and the premise for the future film hinting at DARKSEID. The only thing that the film felt short at was the Doomsday's ruggedness. Other than that a perfect movie. Shout out to Zack Snyder for not doing those childish scenes where all the debris and the weapons are fired at your face just because it's a 3d movie. If you are a comic book reader, movie buff, or just looking for a good cinematic experience this movie is for you. Go watch it in 3D. I am waiting for the directors cut DVD now and the Justice league now.",10,5,11,27 March 2016
