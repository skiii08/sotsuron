The Blair Witch Project," This isn't your typical horror movie, not by a long shot!
","The first thing that comes to my mind when I think of The Blair Witch Project is bone chilling, the second is amazingly creative. This isn't a slasher film full of blood guts and gore, it's something entirely different, it's frightening. This movie relies on building bone chilling suspense that your own imagination supplies for you, probably more frightening than anything the movie industry could supply you with. You see everything the three film makers in the movie see and you hear what they hear and no more. What you don't see is always more frightening than what you do. It's the unknown that is terrifying and all through this movie you have to contend with the unknown. You never know what is going to happen next. You know that something will but never what. The only contrived aspect of this movie is that these three kids would continue to film through everything that they are experiencing. The movie does try and qualify this by having them explain how it makes them feel better seeing things through the camera's eye. Regardless of that, this is a must see movie.",4,2,4,5 August 1999
The Legend of Bagger Vance," A Movie That Touched The Soul
","I've seen this movie on the big screen and the small screen. Regardless of the screen size this movie reaches out to touch you on a spiritual level. The story being told isn't merely about golf but about LIFE. I'm not a huge fan of golf although this movie still held me transfixed.Will Smith gave one of his best performances as the guiding force in Runnulph Junuh's (Matt Damon) coming to terms with life after the World War. Smith's character, Bagger Vance, is also a guiding force for Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief and Jack Lemmon) throughout his life. Jack Lemmon narrates throughout the movie as the voice of a grown Hardy Greaves.This movie has a subtly powerful ending.",8,0,2,1 July 2001
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Real Life Love
","Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of Nicolas Cage's better films. He turns a fine performance as the title character. This is a romance set against the backdrop of a worn torn island. John Hurt's character gives his daughter, played beautifully by Penelope Cruz, some honest advice about love. This movie doesn't have the fault of being completely predictable. This movie also allows Cruz to turn in a performance as a strong woman who knows her own mind and heart. Once the film warms up beyond the opening sequence this film keep you focused on it. Again, Nicolas Cage did not disappoint.",8,2,4,7 April 2002
Ocean's Twelve," A Surprise!
","I loved Ocean's Eleven so I was hesitant to watch the sequel but this didn't fall flat the way so many sequels do. It is strange in that it builds off the original, you would be lost without previous knowledge of Ocean's Eleven, but yet it has an entirely new tone and feeling as well as European look rather than the Vegas glitz of the first movie. I was very happy that all of the originals came back for the sequel. If you like a good action movie that keeps you guessing then this movie is for you. It was very nice to see Brad Pitt's character fleshed out more in this movie. I would like to have seen more of the banter between the Malloy brother characters but on the whole the movie left me wondering if there will be an Ocean's 13. There seemed to be an opening for one with where they left the Night Fox at the end of Ocean's Twelve.",10,25,39,6 May 2005
Some Like It Hot," Did I EVER!
","This is one of the great films in cinematic history. Jack Lemmon as Jerry/Daphne is superb. Tony Curtis as Joe/Josephine/ Jr. As Jr. he sounds somewhat like Cary Grant. His classic good looks don't come across well as a woman nor does Jack Lemmon. Are they ever homely! Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane made me know why she's such a legend. She has the sweetest voice and the most titilating sexuality of any of screen sirens of today even. She is an amazing mix of femme fatale and little girl innocence. Joe E Brown as Osgood Fielding the 3rd was great! He is a comic geninus. The bell hops crush on Josephine is a riot. The dialouge is wonderful. The line 'nobody's perfect' is all so true and this film gives it new meaning even though this film is the exception to the rule! All in all this is a rich sexy, romantic comedy that deserves a place in everyone's viewing repretoire. Every performance in this movie was a classic.",10,1,1,24 October 1999
Goodfellas," A Rare Must See Movie!
","I loved this movie! It was a so real depiction of mob life on the small time going up to the big time. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino were great. Joe Pesci did a great job too but I'll admit that before the movie was over I wanted to 'whack' his character because he grated on my nerves so much, Pesci pulled it off completely. The is a well scripted, superbly executed movie. Liotta was devine. Lorraine Bracco makes you realize how a woman can fall in love with a mobster. This is a rare must see movie. Ray Liotta's best. The dialouge was quick and memorable. Everything was memorable. One caution- the F word gets big time play so if it affends you be warned.",10,0,0,25 September 1999
