The Ring," Good film, but it aint Ringu
","I have only one problem with this remake, and that is the scene with the fly coming out of the tv. This completely spoils the ending of the film! I watched the remake of the far superior Ringu with certain trepidation and was mildly surprised to find I was enjoying it. However the scene with the fly completely ruins the film! The whole point of the shock ending is that you are supposed to be thinking that nothing crosses over from the tv world into the real world - this is why the end of the original was so powerful, disturbing, eye-catching....... However, the remake has already let you in on this as a possibility with the fly - thus rendering the shock aspect of Sadako (sorry Samara) coming out of the tv! Very silly mistake, very silly!",Null,0,0,11 December 2003
The Transporter," Top Notch Stuff
","I went to see this film fully expecting the action to be great, but the dialogue to be utter pants. In all fairness, I was absolutely correct. The dialogue is awful and there are so many cheesy lines you could melt them down and use them in a fondu! However, in a way this only makes the film more watchable. There were countless times when myself and other people in the cinema cracked up (check out the moment when the flowing music kicks in when Statham opens the bag for the first time!) at moments which were quite frankly halarious! But the film really doesnt take itself seriously, and almost seems to recognize that some of the lines are so bad, they are good!Jason Statham has always impressed me, especially in Guy Richie's Snatch, and in this film he doesnt let you down. Okay, so his accent may be dodgy as hell (we personally thought he should have kept the british accent to add to his hard ass image) but he is hard as nails and surprisingly efficient in the fight scenes!Overall, yes the plot is naff, yes the script is tripe, yes some of the acting (Statham aside) is wooden, BUT yes the action is fantastic, yes Statham is cool and yes it is so funny I nearly wet myself!Watch out Vin, Jason is the new action star!",9,0,0,20 January 2003
