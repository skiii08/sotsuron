Scarface," excellent, powerful
","Scarface is a powerful epic gangster film with has become a classic in its own right. So many brilliant quotes thanks to Pacino who really brought life into the character. His performance was superb. The film was critised for being too violent but the violence has dated badly, but even without the gore scenes the impact of Scarface will still be a memorable one, as who could forget that ending!!! spectacular!!",Null,0,0,13 October 2000
X-Men," not as good as I thought it would be
","X-men is one in a very long line of blockbuster disappointments to be released recently. The film is directed by Bryon Singer, who can't make a good action movie. First of all x-men lacks good action set-pieces, even the fight in the statue of liberty wasn't any good. I wanted also to see more of different mutants powers, but obviously the F/X budget didn't stretch that far. The cgi effects were undeniably bad by todays standards. So the film did not enough action, but there were some good points being Wolverene made some good jokes and was the funniest by far, and I liked the open ended ending. I hope the sequels will be better than this.",Null,0,0,27 August 2000
