10 Cloverfield Lane," Hey Shyamalan This is how you do it..!
","Hey Shyamalan, you should go and see this film and remember how good you used to be.10 Cloverfield Lane is a great film, tightly filmed in a cramped underground bunker the tension never lets up, Trachtenberg ramps up the tension revealing the secrets of Winstead's surroundings and bunker-mates whilst teasing what may/may not have happened in the outside world.John Goodman OWNS this film, simultaneously gentle, kind and well meaning, along with threatening, scary and intensely frightening he is a powerhouse in this film.The breathless pace never lets up, as we join Mary Elizabeth Winsteads Michelle in her quest to discover the truth behind her surroundings, Goodman's creepy Howard and her true situation, the time flies by and I for one was unsure where the film might end.Suffice to say the ending will split audiences, it brought me back to the twisting denouements of previous films like The Mist and The Sixth Sense, lots will denigrate it but I for one loved it and I actually wouldn't mind seeing the further adventures of Michelle..An absolute treat.",9,0,2,9 April 2016
The Martian," A Return to form for Sir Ridley Scott.
","Ridley Scott in a return to form absolutely nails Andy Weirs' best selling novel in an sprawling survival tale on the distant planet Mars. His use of 3D makes you a visitor to the sprawling Martian landscapes, putting you right in the heart of the action, whilst Matt Damon, with an outstanding performance, makes the abandoned astronaut Mark Watney someone you root for throughout the entire 140 minutes. Damon's easy going manner, the gorgeous cinematography and solid support from the rest of the cast make this an absolute treat. Toning down the science of the brilliant novel for the masses is a masterstroke in screen writing and the inclusion of some fantastic pop songs bolster the great score. I was a little disappointed that some parts of the novel were skipped over but all in all I loved it.",9,2,59,2 October 2015
