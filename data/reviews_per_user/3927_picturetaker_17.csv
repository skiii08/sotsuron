Sucker Punch," The FUTURE of Video Games! Xbox 720 we welcome you!
","While I love these silly strange movies that are just visual artwork on film. I can't help but feel like I am watching my younger brother play a video game with some of these movies. This one was the MOST like a video game I have ever seen! With levels and HEAVY CGI what is the difference? Who's the player? Why my Samsung Bluray player that's who and he, I'd like to think my Samsung is a he, kick some real butt and finished this game faster then any game I have ever played on my Xbox. This isn't a film as much as its a preview for how video games will look in the future! Xbox 720 we welcome you! It was awesome though, I did like it even if I found the story to be very lacking. How you know a story is poorly written is if you are asking yourself for more then one minute 'Uh what happened? Why are they not in a mental institution anymore and now in a burlesque house?'. I had to ask that for awhile because it was never really established when they went from one to the other. Though I figured she was imagining the scene only because I have seen other movies before that have done this same sort of thing.Overall its a fun movie and the kind you can watch if you don't feel like thinking very much. Just like a video game. Those who have watched this movie, they know what I mean, no one can't say they didn't feel like they watched a video game because that's all SuckerPunch was.",6,1,1,31 August 2011
Ali," I now DISLIKE Muhammad Ali because of this movie! Nah I never liked Ali...
","I've had this movie Ali for years but have never watched it before today. It is a movie about Muhammad Ali the boxer played by Will Smith. I figured it must be good if Will Smith was nominated for an award for his role. I don't see WHY!?! As far as I am concerned this is one of his worst roles I have ever seen him play.I'm not really sure what to say about this movie except I really didn't like it. And the only reason I can see anyone actually liking this movie is because for some reason there is such a love affair with Muhammad Ali that it might be clouding their judgement on what makes a good movie.I suppose he was a great boxer but honestly WHO CARES!?! Because simply in this movie he came off as an obnoxious self absorbed racist jerk. And I don't know the man enough to know if he is or if he is not. Yet this is with out a doubt the worst boxing movie I have ever seen and one of the worst movies period. I really do not recommend this movie that basically figured because it's a movie about Ali that we don't have to try. You always have to try! No matter who its about! Boxing movies can be good. Cinderella man was, Rocky was, Million dollar baby was, this WAS NOT.",1,2,5,13 November 2011
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Episode 3.5 is Great stuff! Its how to make a good prequel!
","I entered the theatre to see Rouge One with great skepticism. I wasn't overly impressed with Star Wars: The Force Awakens as it basically a reboot of 'A New Hope' so my expectations were low. I thought 'Oh no here we go again, some chick is going to be some undiscovered Jedi master again!'. I was wrong! My expectations ruined the start of the movie for me.As it started it seemed as if my expectations were right. Some little abandoned girl (again), who later in life is recruited by the Rebellion and forced to go on a mission (again). That was about it. That is where the comparison towards our girl Jyn Erso in Rouge One and Rey in The Force Awakens ends. In fact the two characters couldn't be further apart in similarities besides being two female leads in two Star Wars films. Jyn is simply a much stronger character then Rey might ever be. And best of all Jyn never picks up or even sees a Lightsabre! She does not become a Jedi master, she will not ever get a trilogy and Rouge One stands alone as a good science fiction movie that has an actual conclusion. Which was great since this is essentially Episode 3.5! The scenes throughout the movie were absolutely amazing. Planet after planet just looked, well real! In fact had I not walked into this movie expecting Jyn Erso to become a Jedi, I probably would have enjoyed this movie so much more. I guess I will have to see it again. Even the story while predictable, especially since everyone seeing this movie have probably seen 'A New Hope' and knows what to expect was still very good.It is an absolute perfect prequel that no one asked for but makes the Episode 1, 2 and 3 look so vastly inferior. This is truly how to make a prequel. I absolutely loved it.",10,1,6,19 December 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek: Into Darkness is simply amazing!
","This review is essentially just my thoughts on this movie. If you want an in depth review I am sure there are others here.OK so I admit I am a Stargeek. I know about Star Trek Canon and the first movie bothered me when they destroyed Vulcan but that was the first movie, this one is way different and way better. Its simply amazing visually, and the fluidic flow to the story was great. The special effects were incredible and it just simply worked!If you want an entertaining couple of hours I urge you to watch this. You shouldn't be bored for even a second. It really is that good. Whether you're a stargeek or a cool person that wont admit they watch Star Trek you WILL LIKE THIS FILM.P.S. Oh and for us stargeeks out there, this one DID have Star Trek Canon in it when it had a small model of the Enterprise from the ST:ENT series in the Admirals office. As we all know Enterprise was a prequel to Kirk's enterprise so everything that happened in ENT happened in this same alternate Star Trek Universe so that was a nice addition for us geeks. Hahaha",10,4,14,19 May 2013
Alexander," Terrible Disappointment! Critics were right!
","My Review for Alexander may seem harsh to some and may seem gentle to others but this is my opinion of this movie.IT STINKS!!! Visually it was fantastic, at times it left me actually believing that they were filmed in Babylon, well except for the fact it was destroyed and it was computer simulation. The story wasn't too bad either, for being fictitious about Alexander the great. Well except for one thing The thing I could not accept or get past, the thing that bothered me was the on going romance between Alexander and Hephaistion. It was very out of place for a male loving male romance. Seeing that Alexander the movie was supposed to be a big historic epic with lots of battles, aka a guy movie with some eye candy for their dates. Like Troy, Gladiator or Braveheart.Because of this romance between the two guys it often left me feeling very uncomfortable to the point the rest of the movie was missed. Although there maybe is 5 or 10 minutes max of this romance and only one part where they got into bed with each other (Thankfully no detail!) those few minutes ruined the movie for me.I bought this movie on DVD to see if what was said was true about it. That maybe it wasn't as bad as people said. However when I was finished watching this movie all I could think was 'WHAT WAS OLIVER STONE THINKING!' He basically ruined a great movie by adding something that did not need to be added to this movie and what's worse something that wasn't even true.Visually it was great! But the male romance in it was more than I needed in a movie of this type. Too bad because I was so hoping that the critics were wrong. Glad I only paid $12.00 CAD for it.",2,8,13,2 December 2005
Insomnia," Amazingly good movie that will stand the test of time!
","Perhaps my favourite Alaskan movie, maybe even my favourite Al Pacino movie and surely guaranteed one of Robin Williams best non comedic roles. INSOMNIA! A movie directed by Christopher Nolan is a movie about a mysterious murder that in a remote town in Alaska lacks the resources in law enforcement to solve it so two detectives from Los Angelas are flown in to help solve it. Yeah so its a pretty basic who done it type movie besides the whole Alaska thing.But what I love about this movie is the realism that Christopher Nolan is famous for. Even before he was known for Batman his movies had that amazing look Nolan is famous for.  The cinematography is incredible. Its like a travel brochure for Alaska! Its simply amazing. The story is great. It leaves you in suspense wondering whats going on but in a good way. And not to spoil anything but the reason its called INSOMNIA is its filmed in the part of summer where the sun never sets (sort of the same as the movie 30 days of night). It just adds to the films allure.So if you like great crime movies in the 'Who done it' genre and you haven't seen this flick? Where have you been!?! Its time to track this movie down and watch it. You will be in awe. Especially if you're a fan of Christopher Nolan's other work or like the actors Al Pacino, Hilary Swank or Robin Williams.",9,2,3,20 February 2017
Cloverfield," Cloverfield is a watchable movie. Could have been better though.
","I am not sure how to review this movie with out breaking it into things I don't like and do like about it. Because I am kind of divided on it. So here it goes Things I don't like about this movie.<ul><li>They wasted this entire movie by making it look like it was shot on a camcorder. This really gets to me.</li></ul><ul><li>The Yuppie party. I really don't like the fact how yuppie and exclusive this party was.</li></ul><ul><li>The lack of information about the monster/alien. We essentially learn nothing what so ever.</li></ul><ul><li>How fast the military shows up. To me it seems a little fast considering its downtown Manhattan.</li></ul><ul><li>To me it seems like Manhattan got empty of people rather quickly.</li></ul><ul><li>The headache I got from watching this movie.</li></ul>Things I like about this movie.<ul><li>I like the concept of this movie. I always think it's a tad predictable that the experts in charge are always the ones in the movies with an alien attack. With Cloverfield its just some yuppies walking around not knowing what to do. So you can relate, well sort of.</li></ul><ul><li>The sets and filming locations were amazing. It did look like a trashed New York city.</li></ul><ul><li>The skyscraper leaning on another building. This is capable of happening when two buildings are very close together.</li></ul><ul><li>The camcorder used for this film is shot in real time. I've read others complain that its unlikely the battery would last for this long, however a battery on a camcorder does in fact last longer then say an hour and a half.</li></ul>Overall it's a pretty good sci-fi movie. Its realistic enough and it has a good concept for an idea, the idea being an Alien attack being filmed by people who have no idea what is going on. It is worth a watch and its pretty entertaining. This is why I give it a 6 out of 10.",6,0,1,14 April 2013
Knocked Up," So gross! Never have I wanted to see a baby crown during birth!
","I found this movie to be very crude in language and subject matter. It was a typical Seth Rogen with the fat guy from SuperBad movie. It wasn't that funny, it had some observational crude humour that you can't help but laugh because its so stupid that your ears are even hearing it but other then that it was bland, unoriginal and a lot of times boring. And it was disgusting I never wanted to see a baby crown during birth, but now I have seen it because the directors chose to gross everyone out by showing that. Thank you. Thank you so so much for that.I give it 1 out of 10 only because that is the lowest I could go. If I could give it a -7000 I would. Simply terrible rubbish of a film.",1,3,5,31 March 2011
Oblivion," Oblivion shows how good CGI can be!
","What a great Sci-Fi movie. It is visually amazing and creative and Tom Crusie performs a great performance in a Tom Crusie kinda way.It essentially is the end of the world. And the population is all gone on Earth ready to move to their new home. So Cruise's character 'Jack' is left to clean up while they take what resources they have left on Earth to the moon around Saturn called Titan. But all is not as it seems. And Jack's world changes as a space shuttle from space crashes near by. I wont say much more because it will totally spoil the movie for you. But take my word for it you are in for a wild ride of special effects, creativity and fascinating premise.I'll likely update this review when I see this movie again. But I wanted to get it up on the day I saw this movie the first time. It is worth seeing a second time.",8,2,5,24 April 2013
The Butterfly Effect," It's a Love story.
","This may be one of the best well thought out movies I have ever seen that ultimately is a love story. Never before have I seen a movie that goes from selfishness to a love story so quickly. You begin thinking that this movie is about science fiction meets sixth sense kinda stuff but towards the end you realize its all been about saving the girl the main character Evan loves who in the end makes the ultimate sacrifice by sacrificing his life to save the girl because there is nothing left for him to do in the end, he's tried everything else. So he gives his life demonstrating true love in the purest of forms. This is what the butterfly effect is, it is a love story from beginning to end.",8,1,2,22 November 2013
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Seeing it in 2017... Uh what was this!?!
","This review absolutely contains some spoilers.I remember seeing this movie when it came out in the theatre. It was a long awaited movie that me and my brother had been waiting for since we saw the first one in 1993. Ah the 1990's movies, some were good and some were awful bad and they were still trying to perfect the blockbuster back then. Some wins like Independence Day and others big time failures like The Flintstones. 20 years later? Uh what was this? Jurrasic Park: The Lost World is in between in my opinion those blockbusters from the 90's. In between a decent CGI blockbuster and a awful one. This movie while decent feels so so. It has a lot wrong with it. And I mean a lot! Lets start with Dr. Ian Malcolm's daughter. Now I don't really care that she is black and he is white. I always just thought he was the kind of good person that adopts a child in need. My problem with her is she couldn't act and she was totally unneeded in the entire movie. Never mind how she got to the Island is a completely mystery to those with half a brain. Like what on earth! How did she hide in the camper that had no real hiding place? Like seriously if we are to believe this, at least show it. Nah don't need that. Never mind Ian Malcolm not saying good-bye or noticing she is not around. In fact another question about these campers is how the flip did they get to the boat that took them to the Island in the first place. When the daughter is on the island, she cooks and makes a fire and that is how they found out. No surprise on the boat or whatever. Nah. Lets not make sense says the movie makers, lets just throw a kid in it like the last JP had so kids seeing the movie will get it.I wish I could say the daughter is the only character that is out of place but basically they all are. Here is a few more. InGen's CEO Peter Ludlow who is trying to save InGen from the financial disaster that came from the original Jurassic Park aftermath. OK. I get it. However why on earth would a CEO ever be on a expedition to get a bunch of dinosaurs off the Island for a zoo. It's like Donald Trump overseeing the construction of one of his buildings on the ground with the construction workers. It does not make sense. Neither would do it.And then there is Vince Vaughn. As a Photographer myself, I understand this character a tad. At least his photography part. I can even over look that his Camera gear is wrong. That's fine, it was the days where only a select few actually took photos so people didn't know including Vince Vaughn. However the unforgivable to his character is the fact he is some sort of Eco Navy Seal Wannabe who frees the dinos and whatever. It was just stupid. And then when they team up later with the group he attacks there is no conflict? None. He even gets the group going again at one point.And don't even get me started on that ridiculous T-Rex in San Diego end. How did it even eat the people on the ship. It would have been better if it was Raptors as that would have made sense. Just plain awful! As you can see, this review is long. Assuming you're still reading it I could go on for pages and pages but the fact is this movie seems rushed. It seems like there wasn't a lot of thought put into it. It just feels and rightly so that it was made because people wanted a sequel. Except it really doesn't feel like a Jurassic Park movie and it is just so full of plot holes.Jurrasic Park is one of Steven Spielburgs best. The Lost World I hate to say is not even close to his best and while not his worst. It isn't even in his top 10 movies he's made.Maybe in 20 years I will watch it again. Nah... Probably not.",3,30,49,21 January 2017
It Follows," IT... Its okay and quite scary
","Scary in a way that I haven't seen since the first 'Ring' movie. Is it really scary? Well obviously not because we're desensitized at this point in society so nothing really scares us these days. But honestly this movie captures the scariest nightmare you just might ever have. I personally liked 'It Follows' mainly because its low budget but it delivers a chilling creepy movie that makes me never want to go to Detroit because there are scary following sex ghosts there. Haha. So is it brilliant? Nah not really but it does keep you on the edge of the seat. It's a good example of when horror is done right and doesn't depend on jump scares to scare you. Best of all. What I liked about this movie is it has no moment where they research the haunting and get to the bottom of it like near every supernatural horror usually does. You know what I mean, they Google search and then take some trip to some person in some obscure place who knows all the answers. Nope! None of that. No priests, witch doctor's, mediums or supernatural experts! The closest we get to this 'research moment' is the group of friends track down the guy who gave the girl the haunting curse. And he knows basically nothing. So this mystery just adds to the movie because it makes it more realistic not knowing.I recommend only if you truly like original horror movies that are not filled with slashing, gore and blood everywhere because there is none and I mean none of that. This isn't a 'Saw' movie.",6,0,0,23 March 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," I watched 50% of this movie on Fast-Forward!
","I never saw this movie in the theater because it was made 12 years before I was born. Yet I have seen just about every space movie made in the last 40 years and this one is by far the worst slow paced movie I have ever seen! It starts out, boring. It goes 25 minutes with out one human word spoken. I say human word because I am not sure if the Apes were speaking Aponese or just gibberish. Not that it mattes because I don't speak any Ape language.Then we go to the space scenes. They are VERY slow. Maybe its realistic maybe its not, I don't care that space is a vacuum with no sound either. I want some space sounds to keep me from feeling like I went deaf. Finally, I could not take any more space scenes. After watching the second LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG one with a sphere spaceship taking forever to land on the moon and coming to the realization that 'This is the most boring movie I have ever seen!' I decided that all space scenes I would simply put on fast forward. Well actually 2X FFWD is WAY TOO SLOW so I actually put it to 4X FFWD and then the space scenes were normal space speed found in other movies like Star Trek or Star Wars or any other spacey show.I get this film and why some, especially at the time thought it was a masterpiece. For its time the Space scenes were amazing! Look at its competition at the time, the Original Star Trek and then look at this film. There is no comparison. However as far as story goes, it was nearly non existence and the movies pace was slower then a earth worm trying to find a hole on the pavement. I've attempted to watch this movie 8 times in my life and only recently I was able to finish this movie and only because I fast-forwarded near 50% of it.This movie is one of those rare ones where people either LOVE it or the HATE it. There is not a lot of people with an opinion about this movie that simply think in between. I hated it. I'm not a action junkie either, I just hated this movie. So Avoid it if you have not watched it, because it is a CAN miss movie, even if you might LOVE it, there still is no reason to watch this old movie.",1,30,59,31 August 2011
Thor," Marvel does it again and makes a movie more realistic then a simple comic book!
","How well did Marvel and the makers do on this film? Absolutely excellent! Now there are some bad reviews out there, not exactly sure why but there are some nonetheless. Yet for me, I like it! What I found is this movie was more a movie about Thor and Asgard and Norse Religion then a simple comic book. The only thing to do with a comic book was the makers and S.H.E.I.L.D. The movie mainly was about the realm Asgard and about a man, Thor who gets exiled on Earth and his evil brother. Simple! As if it was taken out of a Norse story told over a thousand years ago.The story was a bit predictable but then that is what happens when they make thousands of movies every year. Our minds are simply able to predict various outcomes in movies because we have seen so many movies in our lives that its trained to think that way. But it was a good story also.I liked this movie, it is up there with my favorites from Marvel like X-Men (all), Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk.",6,1,4,6 May 2011
The Godfather: Part III," Third time is not the charm in this case.
","For me this is not about the other Godfather movies. The first one was a great movie. The second one was even better but this last one was the one they should have never made. Some movies are better off not becoming a trilogy and this one for sure is one that fits the bill. It was so not needed that it is an insult to the Corleone name.Why I dislike this movie so much was the way it was done. The second Godfather movie did not need to really tie into the first one at all and stood alone with its own story. This one insisted on leaching onto the second story and further explaining it like the audience that saw the second one was too stupid to figure out the plot. It had nonstop flash backs, explaining and so on over mainly the second movie that it really should not be called Godfather three rather Godfather Two and a half.The only redeeming quality of this movie was Al Pacino. It seemed like he was the ONLY one who really showed up for this movie, which includes the directors and writing staff. I only recently saw the Godfather trilogy so I base this review on fresh eyes but the third one absolutely ruined the Godfather movies for me.I only give it a 4 out of 10 because of Al Pacino. If no Al then it would be a 1 (probably -5 if it was possible).",4,1,2,4 December 2006
Taken 2," Taken 2 just doesn't work. Taken 1 was amazing though, watch that!
","This review is essentially just my thoughts on this movie.So assuming you saw TAKEN you know that Kim, the girl in TAKEN 2 was kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery when her and her friend went to France for a vacation after high school so then her Dad rescued them. Now what I don't get about this sequel is that apparently Kim had such a traumatic time in Europe - which is established early in this movie – then why on earth would she ever set foot in Europe again. Like if that happened to me, you can bet I would never ever ever travel to Europe again, and like never travel internationally again either. Yet in this movie Kim just is so quick to hop a plane with her mother (another unlikely person to travel or allow her daughter to travel) and go to not only Europe but Turkey of all places. The place where her kidnappers in France were from because they had Turkish C-Star tattoos on their hands. Never mind the fact that not a whole lot of time has actually passed from the time the girl got kidnapped in the first movie and goes to Turkey in this one. This is a pretty bad oversight on the story writers behalf.So for this reason alone I found that this movie simply is unbelievable and pretty boring. Taken was a great movie that was interesting, scary and suspenseful. Where as Taken 2 really and honestly never needed to be made. If you agree with my thought on this movie please click you found this review helpful. This is all I am going to say on this movie.",2,0,0,12 May 2013
Thor: The Dark World," What on Earth, no Asgard was this?
","I like the first Thor but honestly this one was so boring and predictable that I left the movie theatre tired and incredibly bored. It starts off with a huge battle and that is great. I like battles but it is between the Asgard and the Dark Elves. The dark elves get beaten and thought of as dead. And for some reason Asgard, protector of the nine realms does not really confirm this, they just assume. So an entire millennium passes. Then Natalie Portman is in London. Just like that, for some reason she is in England and then for some reason, just like that in a warehouse is an inter dimensional gate to a dark cave that holds some crazy slimy looking evil ghost like thing, that naturally possesses her sort of. She is still herself but if some touch her they are thrown across the room, while if others touch her they are fine.Well after an hour of this, then finally the Dark Elves attack Asgard, attack London and take the evil from Natalie Portman who survives naturally. Thor does a bunch of punching and tough stares. Loki lies a bunch of times and naturally there is a big alien battle in London and of course Thor saves the day with the help of Natalie Portman and her earthly friends.I honestly found this movie so boring and recycled that I found myself actually wanting to fall a sleep in the theatre. I had such high hopes for this movie because I thought the first one (see my review for it) was pretty good. This one I am not interested in ever seeing again. It is predictable, long and boring.",2,19,33,22 November 2013
