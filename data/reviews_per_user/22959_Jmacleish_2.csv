Hereditary," gave me a headache
","Not a bad start, some good shocks in the first 30 mins... then it just went on and on and on and on..... the 'atmosphere' which is so important in a horror film in particular was massively overdone and in the end the sound (when it comes) gave me a headache.
Other stuff happens, but I was too bored by then.
Far too long. I found myself hoping the film would end sooner than it did.",4,2,6,31 August 2018
Joker," a considered 10
","Watched this film after hearing how great it was, but also aware it was a controversial film.
Simply put - this is a marvellous film, you don't need to read any of the reviews
i have watched it twice already and I'll most likely watch it again.To my mind - it's a Masterpiece.
I have the feeling this film will be talked about for a long time.",10,10,18,26 November 2019
