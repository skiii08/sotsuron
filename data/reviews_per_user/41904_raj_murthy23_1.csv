10 Cloverfield Lane," 10 Cloverfield Lane
","Is this a thriller,science fiction or violence movie??Not able to understand the characters,the director's presentation of the movie or what he's able to say.The movie starts as a normal one with the first 10 minutes,then suddenly an accident happens and the actress suddenly is seen tied in a underground bunker.After about half an hour the heroine just changes her captive's house as her own and suddenly in the end it changes into a zombie and science fiction movie.Just cant understand the movie,,who the characters are and what the director wants to say to the audience.Pls make good movies which satisfies the viewers at least to a fair and believable extent.",1,61,119,30 April 2016
