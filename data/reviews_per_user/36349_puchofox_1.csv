Scarface," whyyyyyyyyyy??
","Scarface, a brilliant portrayal of a Cuban male in America trying to make it? or the stupidest film ever made. For some the former just might be true for me the latter always seems to pop up inside my mind. Each time I view this atrocity trying to figure out the appeal i get angry and offended by Gina's over acting and Tony's bad accent. Never in my life have i met a Cuban person (and i've met quite a few) that talked acted breathed lived in the way tony did, and i know this is a fictional portrayal, but this was so fictional that i wouldn't have been surprised if unicorns were prancing around inside the cocaine mounds. i guess if the goal was to get people to think that all Cubans are criminals and coke-heads then they succeeded. my advice to those who might want to subject themselves to hours of predictable mindless drivel is don't, but if you must, do it with a friend at best this movie is good for a laugh.",1,17,38,11 October 2006
