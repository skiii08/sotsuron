Despicable Me 2," Fell Short of the Goal
","This movie might be worth the rental and then it is just something to toss at your kids about 6 to 8 years old. The first movie was hit with both young and old but this movie is just clichÃ© filled with tropes and idioms. Unlike the first story this one lacks humor.The writers completely lose sight of the good characters from the first movie such as; Vector, Dr. Nefario, and even Gru's Mom. They bring in a new villain who leaves a dry taste in your mouth. The only thing original and funny about him was his premature demise. Instead the comedy falls on the shoulders of his minions. The plot is far too predictable for any adult. The moral of the tale? Apparently single parents are just no good at raising children.",4,16,26,6 July 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Good Game, Great Movie
","For those of you who have played Lucas Arts 'Monkey Island' Will Turner was a great Guybrush.  Yes, this movie patterns the old PC adventure game right down to the zombie pirate La Chuck kidnapping Elaine.  If you saw the movie play the game and if you played the game watch the movie!  The names have been changed to protect the writers from George Lucas lawsuits.  Maybe it's not original but what the heck is these days?",Null,0,0,13 December 2003
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," A Fair Movie with No Shelf Life
","Back in 2003, Ubisoft made a wonderful story around an action and puzzle filled video game. Where you play a prince who is assisted by a princess/slave girl named Farra. The basic video game hook was a dagger that could reverse time and thus save your character from multiple deaths. Fending off sand zombies in a labyrinth palace maze the game plot was very riveting.First I will state, the only elements to survive the game and was incorporated into this movie are the dagger and the prince. Farra is replaced by a different princess and we only see the dagger used four times in the whole 2 hours of the movie. While the game has the prince battling mystical monsters brought forth by the sands of time, no such action takes place in the film. The game has some very challenging puzzles that make you want to play again and again. No such mental puzzle solving feats appeared in the movie.The movie, apart from the game, was just a run of the mill action flick. Something you might enjoy watching once and will be tossed on the shelf to collect dust. Nothing really stands out, the acting was nothing to rave about, the special effects were average for a Disney movie, the sword fights and acrobatics was less than expected, and no great revelation was made. Personally there has been worse done with the video game to movie genre.I gave this movie a below average rating because I would expect better from Disney Studios. Lately it seems everyone has lost their imagination and cannot create something original. Today they resort to remakes, sequels, and borrowing from old video game plots. If they must resort to pulling stories from video games, at least stick to the elements that made the game great.",3,6,12,27 September 2010
Ted," Before You View, Ask Yourself...
","Ask yourself who thinks potty humor is great? Think of the stuff you avoid reading on bathroom walls. The type of humor juveniles think is funny about abusing women, sex, drugs, and lots of curse words. If you are still wanting to see Ted, go ahead watch it or rent it.Now that you watched it, if you replace the 'magic teddy bear' with a pal or even an adopted brother, is this movie still funny to you? I didn't find this an amusing movie at all. In fact, my friend rented it and I was under the assumption it was made for 'little kids' under 12. Boy was I wrong. I am so glad I wasn't the father who dumped his kids off to go see the magic talking bear, movie while I went shopping in the mall.OK why I gave this movie the 3 stars it truly deserves is the on screen actors. It is nothing to stand in the studio and read lines for voice overs and spout off bad jokes. But there was some talent at work for all the actors who had to sit and talk to an invisible bear and make it look real. I have no issues with Seth MacFarlane, writer/director of this crap, who will continue writing turds like this on TV. He is the voice of Ted and other voices on his adult cartoon shows. This man has been degrading the value of TV for the past decade since I was a child.",3,1,3,17 December 2012
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A Fair X-Men Prequel
",Anyone who has seen any of the X-Men Films should enjoy watching this one. However die hard fans of certain characters (such as myself) might be disappointed by the various changes in the character biographies. The movie suffers a bit from the loss of action as most of the movie is about the biography of Wolverine and the mutants he called friends and lovers prior to suffering his memory loss. The only other drawback to the movie being a prequel is knowing which characters will survive. This adds to the loss of suspense during the action. If you are a big fan of the comics or the movies then I am sure you can enjoy this movie as much as I did. I am sure anyone else who hasn't picked up a comic book or seen the other movies can and will enjoy it greater.,6,0,3,20 September 2009
21 Jump Street," Enjoyable Police Comedy
","First I want the reader to note that the community 'average rating' is a seven so I liked it a bit more than everyone else did. Not being part of the 1980s pop culture, that obviously enjoyed the TV series, I seem to have enjoyed the movie for what is was meant to be. The movie is a hilarious police comedy. The TV series (what little I saw of it) was a dull action drama with teen issues and teen fans too.This movie parodies a lot of the typical things we see --far too much of-- in today's action films. The movie shows two young men who despite being polar opposites join the police academy to see action, explosions, car chases, and bullets flying. Yes, they join for all the wrong reasons. After their first big bust, they are assigned to 21 Jump Street because 7 years after high school they still look very young. But they are assigned mostly to be punished.The acting is above par for this kind of film. The dialog and plot are great. The gags are over the top. It is funny to see two adults return to high school after 7 years to find out nothing is the same as before. If you get a chance watch it with your friends and not your mom and dad or anyone else who is a 'fan' of the TV series.",8,1,2,20 January 2014
Oblivion," Predictable Average Sci-Fi Flick
","This movie was a little too easy to figure out and has issues with character motivation. Too many clues are given to the plot in the first few minutes to think otherwise.Lots of visual 'eye candy' make up this film. But I am not entertained by a two hour fireworks display either. Over all this could have been told in an hour on TV such as the Outer Limits or Twilight Zone.A few scenes in the movie seemed like forced acting. For example; A lot of Vics scenes lacked motivation. Jack's deception at the end seemed rather lame. No Oscar performances here.It is worth a look, if you have nothing else to do. It is better than just sitting around picking your nose. Here are some of the movies 'flaws' if you want to call it that.DEAD GIVE AWAYS: I am immediately made suspicious of any 'superiors' who demand a mind wipe for being the janitor and repair man. Jack and Vic never seem to question the Tech 49 and Tower 49 naming convention for the only 2 people remaining on a dying world. Finally I find is very odd that anyone or anything can copy a human flawlessly, however can't completely remove those memories. Alien AI never heard of geostationary satellite orbit, but then again they had to orbit the planet the to talk to the countless other Jacks and Victorias.",5,0,0,2 January 2015
The Italian Job," Above Average Action Crime Movie
","I have to give them credit for making an original plot and not falling back on a remake of some tire 1960's film. However the plot was transparent from my point of view. There are no big moments of jaw dropping 'Wow! I didn't know that was going to happen.'.The Italian job starts in Venice Italy and thus the name. After that the remainder and majority of this film is in sunny California. It is your basic revenge action robbery without police interference. Personally I think it was a wise idea to not show police, in this 'style' of film, where you are cheering for the criminal to win.Good cast and acting, along with great stunts and effects. While this was my very first viewing of the movie on Netflix, I quickly noticed that many scenes have been duplicated in the video game 'GTA V' right down to the buildings. I was sitting there and looked at my brother, 'Hey! We played this on GTA.'. So you know the movie is cool when people plagiarize it.",7,2,3,4 April 2014
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Good movie and set up for a series
","This movie closes one major plot hole in the second movie 'T2'.  If John Conner is a product of the future and that future was altered or erased he would have dissapeared at the end of the second movie.  This movie puts the future back on track and is a good close to the movie trilogy.  But is it the end? Heck no, you can count on some Hollywood hack putting together a made for cable series.",Null,0,0,20 November 2003
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Steampunk Bros Grimm
","This is additional to the story we all know from our childhood. Only instead of the traditional ending we witness Hansel and Gretel become steampunk mercenaries. For those who don't know, steampunk is genre of fantasy that features steam-powered machinery or inventions far ahead of their time. At any moment I thought for sure Hansel would whip out a hand powered cell phone and call his sister. This action packed romp is not for the kids, but geared for the adult action junkies. The acting is over the top, but that is part of its charm. Not my top pick for a movie but this could have been done a lot worse. Definitively a 'guy film' with naked babes, tight leather, explosions, and dismemberment. There wasn't any surprises or big reveals, the plot is straight forward. Overall it would have been better to have just developed an original story than linking this to the Hansel and Gretel story. Too many guys aren't going to jump at watching something that sounds like it was meant for children and I can imagine the irate parents who thought this was a scary movie for the family to watch.",6,3,5,25 May 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Web Shooters Was the Only Thing Correct
","This movie was OK but they practically re-imagined Spiderman. I seldom like people who pick a movie apart but this movie left me wondering; did they tell Stan Lee to shut up and sit in the corner? Here come the spoilers; 1. Peter Parker is a cool rad skateboarder dude. 2. Peter Parker defends a nerd from Flash Thompson... really? 3. Peter Parker dates Gwen and tells her he is Spiderman. 4. Uncle Ben is shot by a man outside a convenience store after it is robbed. 5. Peter Parker never took up wrestling. 6. Norman Osborn is dying of cancer. 7. Peter's parents are not spies working CIA but biologists working for OSCORP to develop cross species genetics with Dr. Curt Connors. 8. Dr. Connors has to repeatedly inject himself to become the Lizard... also shows signs of schizophrenia. 9. Gwen's father the Chief of Police is a little too much like JJ Jameson who did not appear in this movie. 10. Peter Parker/Spiderman is a showboat and can't keep his mask on, 'LOOK Mom! I'm Spiderman!'There is much more. If you never picked up a book or know any Spiderman lore you might enjoy this movie. Maybe.",4,0,3,26 November 2012
District 9," Good SciFi Without Mainstream Actors
","It says a lot about any movie that can do this well at the theater and rentals without the leads being big Hollywood names. The movie is filmed in the documentary style of 'COPS'. There is no romance or comedy, only the dark agendas of large corporations. The action is saved up in the last half of the picture. In my opinion the movie was a success and if you haven't viewed it you should do that instead of reading about it.For those of you who have viewed the movie; I do like the fact that a UFO appears over Johannesburg, South Africa instead of a popular city in the US or UK. However, I felt like the movie failed to explain, how the South African government kept those others out of their way. The other aspects of the movie that seemed a bit off was the locals could understand the alien language so well, but never spoke it, as well the prawn understood English, but never once utters a word in English. The fact that alien weapons were even allowed to get off the ship is remarkable. But to end up strewn about the area of District 9 would be highly improbable.I would look forward to a sequel if I thought they could pull it off in this same manner.",8,0,3,4 November 2009
The Matrix Reloaded," Eh, it was okay...
","I just got this on DVD and watched it.  There are no revelations. There is one dull moment that the original movie managed to avoid SEX.  Yes we all know people have sex and that Neo is in love with his girl but do we really need to see it??  The worst part is, it keeps cutting back and forth between Neo and Trinity in bed to a practical orgy of dancing people.  I haven't had sex yet, so I guess I can't relate.  Now the action is still there but the freeway scene lasts so long you begin to get numb.  They begin to explain how programs interact inside the matrix and that some programs are acting more like humans.  Then a woman has sex with her cake... well I guess it was okay but the ending will leave you will more questions than answers.  I felt like I just should have waited for the third movie to hit the shelf and rented all three.",Null,0,0,31 October 2003
Donnie Darko," A Fanastic Work of Art
","I rarely give movies such high marks, but I find nothing to pick apart in Donnie Darko. Everything down to the soundtrack is just so perfect. The story revolves around a teen held back in school for anti-social behavior. It is established early in the film that he is seeing a therapist for issues and is on medication. So this film has you wondering if Donnie is a mentally ill teen seeing things or someone caught up in supernatural events? By the end of this movie you will be in complete awe of the outcome. I just about guarantee you will view it again to see the subtle hints and nuances that make the story so unique. I just purchased my DVD from the store last night and viewed it three times already. It is an incredible masterpiece.",10,0,2,10 May 2009
