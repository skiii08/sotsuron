Skyfall," What, set a trap in Scotland, without backup?
","No backup in Scotland. This is M, a rather important person to the government and no protection..and why would Silva choose to attack in such a trap situation? It is because they wanted to drag out Silva's demise in excruciating length. Craig's acting can't turn a Swiss cheese plot into even a solid Havarti. The beginning of the love-hate depravity type in all the Bond villains that would follow. No more simple world domination, now these guys are just weird.",2,3,6,16 April 2018
Shooter," Watch the very last shot as the car drives away
","Viewers of films like this are asked to set aside considerations like .... well, reality. In the very last sequence as the girl drives Mark Wahlberg away from the exploding house where he has just murdered the three villains, she pulls away FROM THE DRIVEWAY leaving tire tracks...in the dirt, breaking through the snow, yes, and the tracks are clearly visible in this scene. Police could then simply look at the tire marks, trace the murder to the girl and thus the already likely suspect Wahlberg who has just been released from custody. Problem? Maybe, if he cares at all about the girl (which is the implication at the end in the movie) and if he cares about his own freedom. Hard to believe this.",2,2,5,30 May 2010
