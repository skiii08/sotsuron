The Blair Witch Project," Absolutely brilliant!!
","Wow! I was speechless for 5 minutes after seeing this movie. I expected a nice little experimental movie, but what I saw scared the hell out of me! Normally I don't get scared so easy but this was the most thrilling experience I've ever had. This is the first movie that brought my heartbeat to a dangerous frequence and that for quite long periods. Maybe this was because I didn't know that this film is just a fake!! The acting and camera was brilliant. Watch this film if you really want to be scared. I will surely see it again!",10,1,2,25 November 1999
