Ghost," Life after death? Hmmm...
","I first saw this movie when I was about 12 years old. It's one of the few movies that I've evr watched that I continue to watch faithfully to this day.It really makes you think about the question, 'is there really life after death?'Whether it's a belief that one goes to Heaven or Hell, or whether the spirit if reincarnated on earth, or is death simply, the end?Who knows. This movie will make you think about it.So think about the next time you're alone and that door closes by itself, or that light clanks on and off, are you really alone?However this movie was not meant to be scary at all, which is what I thought when I first heard the title.  It's actually the touching story of a murdered man named Sam who refuses to leave his fiance's side, even in death.Molly is of course, oblivious to his prescence.He enlists in the help of psychic Oda Mae Brown (played by Whoopi Goldberg, and her performance alone is reason enough to catch this flick), to his surprise he finds out really can hear him (after she's been ripping off all her customers who want to contact departed loved ones.His fiance (Demi Moore) is of course a bit reluctant to believe some stranger who shows up at her door telling her that she's talking to her dead boyfriend.Even after Brown reveals things to Molly that only her and Sam knew and many of their most private moments, she's still somewhat unconvinced.Finally she does become convinced and agrres to let Brown in.Sam wants to warn Molly that his best friend had him murdered and that she could be next.Probably the most touching part of the film is when Oda Mae lets Sam 'use her body' so that he and Molly can hold each other one last time.It all comes to a head when Sam's best friend confronts Molly and Brown and Sam is there to protect them from beyond the grave. Carl, (Sam's friend [with pals like that who needs enemies?]) is impaled on glass during the melee and he dies. And after seeing his own body he's taken away by the shadow ghosts (probably the only half-way scary part of the whole film).And in closing, Molly somehow can finally hear Sam as he tells her goodbye and goes into the light.I love this film.I think I'll go watch it now.",Null,1,2,18 June 2004
Batman Returns," Did it ever occur to anyone?
","This is a movie based on a COMIC BOOK!!! Stop taking it so seriously. I've read some reviews where people are analyzing it as if it is Shakespearean theatre.The first Batman was a masterpiece and no one was touching Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker.That being said, I've Danny DeVito's performance criticized here but I really can't see anyone else filling the Penguin's shoes. Michelle Pfeiffer gives the best performance of the Catwoman I've ever seen.She ties to be evil but is really a good person deep down.I will admit that the plot goes down faster than a concrete balloon after the part where Penguin is chased back into the sewers.Penguin pallbearers?Sheesh!",Null,0,1,31 May 2005
Spider-Man," Long live Web-head!
","I recently saw a comment where someone said they didn't think it was necessary that Uncle Ben die.Whoever made that comment obviously knows nothing about the origin of Spider-Man as is it written in MArvel Comics.Peter Parker becomes Spider-man after a failed attempt as a wrestler and his Uncle is killed by a criminal that Peter himself could have stopped, but he didn't.READ THE COMIC.It reads the same way!It make me sick when people who know nothing about the comic book start commenting on stuff that they know nothing about!!!Espcially when they start dissing it!At least know what you're talking about.You have to be familiar with and appreciate comics to be fans of these sort of movies.Kinda funny that you're dissing a Batman movie but outside of the movie you don't know a damn thing about the Dark Knight, huh?I think the Spider-Man film was good, but the story-line could have been better.I mean come on! The Goblin goes after Peter because he steals his sons' girlfriend?Geez! My two year old son could have come up with a more interesting plot than that.Other than that, an enjoyable watch.",Null,0,1,3 July 2004
Batman Begins," A masterpiece!!!
","Being a comic book fan and creator, I truly can relate to this movie.I've always been a huge fan of Batman. When the late great Bob Kane gave us Batsy he gave us the world's second biggest superhero (second only to Superman).My personal opinion is that those two carried DC Comics for years and still continue to do so.I mean really, who cares about the Green Lantern, and Martian Manhunter, the JLA is all about Supes and Bats.Batman had not really been taken seriously as a superhero for years(thanks to that horrible 60's television show). It wasn't until Tim Burton put his spin on the Dark Knight did people start to respect him again.Tim Burton and Michael Keaton reinvented Batman for what he was. A dark figure that was supposed to strike terror into the hearts of those who did evil.Joel Schumacher destroyed that respect Batman had regained with those two horrible sequels in 1995 and 1997. (Batsuits with nipples, ugh).Just when I thought the Batman movie franchise had died forever in comes Batman Begins.I took my kids to see this when it first came out. We enjoyed it then and since I just picked it up on DVD yesterday, we enjoy it even more now.Christian Bale does an even better job at Batman/Bruce Wayne than Michael Keaton did and I did not think that was possible.Wonderful supporting cast and they kept it a bit on the scary side, which is what Batman was always meant to be.The director lets up see Batman in the criminals' eyes. A supernatural horrific figure.I especially love that thing they did with his voice to make him sound more sinister.It was interesting to see how he got his start as the first half of the movie is him training to be the Dark Knight.Unbelievable movie and I have watched it already four times since buying it.My co-workers are all asking me to borrow it.Buy your own!!!!",Null,2,3,20 October 2005
X2: X-Men United," Being the comic book nut that I am....
","I make it a must to see any comic book based movie. I really didn't think it could get any better than the first X-Men.I was wrong! This movie is a comic fanboy's dream.Some of the acting from certain characters (Kelly Hu) was sort of bland.I did like Iceman's chatacter development in the film.My only real disappointment is I would have liked to have seen more charcters from the comic, like Silver Samurai or Omega Red or maybe Psylocke.",Null,0,0,28 June 2004
