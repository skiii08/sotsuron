Scarface," Greatest Movie ever.
","The thing that truly makes Scarface unique to me is that the more so called classic movies a see, the more a realise the beauty and perfection of this film! Godfather lacks the insane intensity and realness of it, in fact the only film that bears any resembelence to this that can claim to be in the same league is Taxi Driver, but even that pales in comparison. Tony, as a character has more classic qoutes than any other movie character ever. Period. Every line in taught and consise, he doesn't even  waste a single muscle movement in facial expression. Practically every scene is an instant classic, IMO, and the film is like a snowball that just builds and builds with every moment - leading to the end - surley the greatest ending ever. In closing, Ive seen this movie about 100 times and am still not even close to becoming sick of it. 11/10",10,0,1,29 April 2002
