Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Good and enjoyable
","I expected more spectacular and impressive film. Movie is good and enjoyable, is also completed, unlike other parts. Many helps 3D effect. The best moments are collected in advertising the film. However, it should be seen, one of the mandatory. Penelope stood not particularly well. Interestingly, once again, Depp is not presented as a leader, but the entire film rests on Depp. I do not see how the movie will be extended without losing the magic. In my opinion, should be scored another strong character. Depp to present itself as an adult who instructs his grandson Charlie Sheen:). The new target of the pirates may be to find Atlantis and come into collision with pirates from other planets.",6,6,8,24 May 2011
Elysium," Quickly made and unfinished film
","The idea of the film is excellent, but it is not assembled properly. The trailer is misleading. Hastily made and unfinished film. Worth seeing just to give your idea about how to make the film. Action had to be developed more of Elysium. Life of Elysium never been described, only misery on earth, which was to Latinos and plates. Jodie Foster was doing well with the role, but was unable to unfold. Some random bum enter the main role of the villain and the movie revolved around him. The main character died and so could not engage in the healing chamber. Matt Damon was just a messenger and failed to enter the true role of savior - not able to personally lead negotiations with the management of Elysium. It was not clear how Elysium was not crowded, and why not build more of these towns. Protection of Elysium was very weak, relying on the protection from the earth from a bum. A ship landed on Elysium like that.",5,0,2,13 August 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Bad casting
","Only for respect to Star Wars will not put score 1. The story is well enough, but I expect more about the casting of the new artists. The girl is excellent choice, but the fat afroamerican is bad choice, also the evil new Wader is funny guy, which is not suitable for this role. Maybe he must not put down the mask. There was no new special characters and machines. The kill of Han Solo was not good scene, very simple and not appropriate. I know the expectations are big but this movie is not reaching the middle level for Star Wars movie. If you want to make another SW movies have to think if it is right. Star Wars is not just another movie, don't push the money machine just for the sport.",7,5,15,9 January 2016
