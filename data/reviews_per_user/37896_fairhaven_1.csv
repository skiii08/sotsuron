The Avengers," We loved it...
","We were able to go as a family and it keeps you really interested right from the beginning. It was exciting and really fun, it had so many funny parts. More recent movies have a lot of one liners that are annoying, but this was great, people were laughing out loud. We of course loved the characters, which made the movie even better, because of how they set this up to this point. I think that was a lot of it, they pulled this together from movies we already loved, so we didn't have to watch characters develop, but got deeper into ones we already knew. The audience loved it,everyone clapped at the end and were talking and laughing about it as they were leaving. Thank you so much for making something we could all see and we will be going again, loved it.",10,1,4,4 May 2012
