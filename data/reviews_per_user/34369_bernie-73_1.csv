The Sound of Music," The hills are most certainly alive with this masterpiece
","I don't think that in the history of film musicals there has been a greater or more enchanting piece then `The Sound of Music`.  It is set in Austria, where the views are breath taking, and from the moment Julie Andrews comes waltzing into view, singing about the hills, to the very end, the film has the audience entranced. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are great in their roles as the novice nun and sea captain, and whoever said Andrews couldn't act obviously hadn't seen this film. The songs are great and you find yourself singing about deers and yodeling for days to come, and although the film is quite lenghty at nearly three hours, you barely realise, as the film never loses its pace for a minute. Anyone who hasn't seen this film, has obviously had a very deprived childhood, as its one of the greatest films of the 20th century, and will no doubt captivate audiences for years to come.",10,3,10,12 June 2000
