Ali," Will Smith has grown as an actor
","The movie focuses on the time between when a young Cassius Clay first wins the Heavyweight Championship of the World from Sonny Liston and when a 32 year old Muhammad Ali regains the Championship from George Foreman at the Rumble in the Jungle.  The movie focuses less on Ali in the ring and more on his life outside.  You see the multiple marriages, his conversion to Islam, his fractured relationship with Malcolm X, and most importantly his battle with the United States Courts when Ali refused to serve in Viet Nam. Michael Mann directs this in his usual visual intense style.   If you have ever seen a production by Mann (Miami Vice, The Last of the Mohicanns, and The Insider to name a small few) you know that he deals with a variety of colors to focus the movie and the scenery tells the story almost as much as the script. The acting is superb by almost everyone involved in the movie but a few people really stand out.  Will Smith proves that Robert De Niro is not the only one who will gain weight by packing about 20 to 30 pounds of muscle on his frame and then completely immerses himself in the cadence and style of Ali's speech.  Few actors today would seem to have the capability to spout off some of Ali's tirades as Will does.  Jamie Foxx does an incredible job as Bundini Brown.  His breakdown on drugs and the fight back to sobriety shows that this former In Living Color co-star can handle a great deal more than we originally thought.  The surprise of the movie was Jon Voight. People have portrayed Howard Cosell before but Voight actually becomes him. He sounded like Cosell and the make-up job was so detailed that I had to look a couple of times before I was able to actually recognize Voight. The relationship between Ali and Cosell is played up on many levels showing how each actually helped catapult the other into the levels of stardom that they reached. The movie is very, very well done.  The script was tight and didn't stray into too many areas that would have dragged the movie down.  The direction was on top and the dialogue was rapid fire and concise.",Null,0,0,3 February 2002
Blade II," A worthy sequel
","Blade II:  Blood Hunt	Sequels are a tricky business.  You can take a perfectly good movie and in the interest of bringing in more dough, end up with something that isn't near as good (witness the glory of Highlander and the sequel we won't discuss), or, you can write a story well enough that you have something which improves on the first (see the fun Rush Hour and the improved Rush Hour 2).  Thankfully the folks from Marvel Comics movie line were able to fall into the latter category with Blade II. 	Those of us who saw the first one (or read the comics which he appeared in) know that Blade (played by Wesley Snipes) was infected by the vampire virus while in utero and was born with all the strengths of the vampire (nearly invulnerable, enhanced strength, increased speed and agility) and none of their weaknesses (crosses, sunlight, silver).  He does have the blood lust of the vampire but through serums is able to keep it under control.  As we saw in the first movie, with the assistance of his ally Whistler, Kris Kristofferson, Blade is the scourge of the vampire nations. 	Since the end of the first movie approximately three years have passed.  It appeared at the time of that movie that Whistler had died but apparently he had been whisked away by the vampires and was constantly being moved as Blade and his new weapons ally, Scud, tracked them across the world.  Blade finally frees Whistler and the three find their hideout under attack by some vampire warriors.  However the warriors are only bringing a message to Blade from the leader of the vampires.  They are proposing a truce as something far worse than Blade has begun hunting them.  A new breed of vampires known as Reapers have mutated and begun attacking vampires.  Unfortunately a bite from a Reaper tends to turn the attacked vampire into a new Reaper with the urge to kill more vampires.  Typically this wouldn't bother Blade but once the vampires are gone, humanity would be the next prey. 	Blade agrees to lead a group of warrior known as The Bloodpack against the Reapers.  The irony here occurs in that the Bloodpack has spent the better part of two years training to fight their new leader.  The pack on a whole is anonymous with two standing out, Reinhardt played by Ron Perlman is their deposed leader and Nyssa played by Leonor Varela carries a secret which will unfold throughout the movie. 	The first meeting of Blade's group doesn't go near as well as they hoped since they discover most of the typical weapons against vampires are now useless.  Through some research they discover the main weapon, sunlight, still works and set about making new weapons. 	The final battle against the Reapers carries some consequences unforeseen and then treachery strikes Blade with the actual villain being revealed. 	This movie is heavily action oriented, is about a vampire hunter, and is quite gory.  If those things turn you off, don't go see this movie.  If, on the other hand, you don't mind those, you will most likely find this an entertaining movie.  Spanish Director Guillermo del Toro brings a dark, macabre look to this film.  His Reapers are as different from vampires as vampires from humanity.  Their look is stylized and fresh.  Their method of attack must be seen to be believed.  His pacing of the movie is right on pace with possibly more action than the original yet still maintaining some semblance's of an adequate plot. 	The actors tend to be what makes this movie.  Many people see Wesley in only action roles and don't realize that he can act.  Here he handles the action sequences superbly and has an understated method for delivering his lines in the best possible manner.  He gets off many worthy of laughs.  Ron Perlman is probably doing the best role I have seen from him in a long time. Usually his characters die relatively quickly but Reinhardt survives much of the movie and is one truly evil personÂ…uh vampire. 	The fight choreography is spectacular.  Donnie Yen, most recently seen in Highlander: Endgame and soon to be seen in Shanghai Knights, plays as one of the Bloodpack.  His character doesn't get much screen time but his pacing for the fights is wonderful.  The sequences are much more intricate than the previous film and lead to a glorious treat for action fans. 	Are there problems with this movie?  Sure, a couple.  The relationship between Blade and Nyssa isn't explained too well and some of the computer graphics do go way over the top.  In fact an early scene had me wondering but they pulled it together before going further.  However, those are just a small sampling which otherwise don't detract from a wonderful addition to the Blade universe. ***",Null,0,1,26 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Oh the agony...
","A long time ago a great director named George Lucas created a groundbreaking trilogy in the sci-fi/fantasy genre.  He called it Star Wars and told it as the second trilogy.  Now he is creating the first trilogy and since we are at the mid-way point of the story arc it is easy to see that George has forgotten what made the magic of the first series. The Phantom Menace introduced the audience to Anakin Skywalker, better known as Darth Vader, as a child.  We also were given glimpses of a young Obi-Wan Kenobi and Princess Amidala.  Attack of the Clones brings us Anakin and the other characters 10 years in the future.  Amidala has become a Senator from her planet and Anakin is firmly entrenched as a student of Obi-Wan Kenobi.  They meet up again when Anakin and Kenobi are called back by the Jedi Council after a failed attempt on Amidala's life.Kenobi decides to follow up on evidence concerning a clone army being built while tracking the bounty hunter, Jango Fett, who launched the attack.  He reluctantly assigns his student to follow Amidala back to her home planet as a bodyguard.  Anakin is initially against this but realizes that his childhood crush on Amidala is becoming a more adult love so he complies. As Anakin and Amidala grow closer, Kenobi discovers all the information concerning the clone army and tracks the bounty hunter to his meeting with his boss Darth Tyrannous.  After Kenobi is captured, Anakin and Amidala decide to launch a rescue ahead of the Jedi Council team led by Mace Windu. We then see the might of the Jedi unleashed against an army of Droids and the arrival of Master Yoda at the head of an army of clones beginning the Clone Wars mentioned in the original Star Wars movie. This seemed to be very much two different movies.  The first half is a love story between Anakin and Amidala and the second half is a Star Wars movie. The thing that worked so well in the original trilogy is the chemistry between the characters.  The three principals carried the movie and made you want to see each additional episode.  There is nothing like that in this movie.  The only characters that exhibit any chemistry at all together are C-3PO and R2-D2, which is a bad thing to say since they are DROIDS and contrary to popular rumor, this wasn't a love story about them.  Natalie Portman again plays Amidala and, while Natalie is a good actress, she has no chemistry whatsoever with her co-star. Hayden Christensen is cast as Anakin.  In the future Vader was an imposing figure.  Right now, Anakin is played as a talented brat.  True, the seeds have been planted which will facilitate Vader's fall to the dark side but right now he seems more like someone who just needs his behind pattled. Hayden Christensen has absolutely no concept of the character and can't play any type of menace.  He sulks but that is about it. Perhaps it would be best to throw the blame also at Lucas as Hayden is mouthing the lines written and in that matter, Lucas has made major mistakes as the dialogue is atrocious.  It was almost agony to sit through some of the discussions between the characters, as everything seemed false and flat. While the dialogue was absolutely awful and the actors need some serious re-casting, this was a visually exciting movie.  The space scenes, the battles, and the backgrounds are all breathtaking on the big screen. Unfortunately the special effects didn't carry the first trilogy and Lucas really needs to remember that. The last portion of the movie does save things somewhat as we have an all out Jedi battle, which is entertaining to watch.  Finally Lucas has released Master Yoda and, like the Droids, Yoda steals the show from the human actors.  Lucas has a lot to make up for in the final movie and hopefully he will be able to do so.  Right now things don't look too good for the trilogy though.",Null,0,0,20 May 2002
The Bourne Identity," Great Action and not much else
","Those kids from Good Will Hunting are really growing up.  Now that they have grown up they want to go from the cerebral to the action oriented in one bound.  Right now you could go to the theater and find  Ben Affleck playing a C.I.A. Analyst in The Sum of All Fears or you could check out the adaptation of Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity with Matt Damon as the lead.  I can't speak for the latter but you might want to wait and rent this one. 	Matt Damon plays the title role of Jason Borne.  Borne has a lot of special talents unfortunately he has to learn about them one at a time because, well, he has lost his memory.  It seems that he was pulled out of the ocean with two bullets in him as well as a nice little micro-chip.  The men on this ship thought he was dead but much to their surprise he is still alive and after some quick surgery, healing rather rapidly.  He doesn't know who he is or how he came to be in the ocean.  He does know that he seems to speak multiple languages fluently and that this chip is leading him to an address of a bank in Zurich. 	After getting to this bank, the man discovers that he appears to have multiple identities of which Jason Borne seems the most comfortable.  He also has quite a bit of cash, some weapons, and after being attacked...a good deal of fighting skills he was unaware of possessing.  Borne is forced on the run to discover his identity.  Unfortunately the longer he is on the run, the more people with similar skills pop up trying to kill him.  It seems that a major governmental agency is not happy having supposedly dead agents reappear without contacting them. 	First off  I must admit that I have never read the original book so I cannot comment as to how accurate an adaptation this movie is.  That being said, I will state this is a very uneven movie.  The action sequences are first rate and engrossing.  The speed of them can keep you riveted on the edge of your seat.  That's the good news.	 	The bad news is that the rest of the movie moves as a snails pace and doesn't sustain the suspense in the slightest.  If anything the middle sequences slow the movie considerably.  Also, the movie doesn't seem to go anywhere.  The beginning makes some sense for story purposes but the end just happens with no particular climactic moment.  One minute the movie is going along and the next...it just stops dead in its tracks.  It almost leaves you wanting more with the earnest hope that something else will happen to explain the movie. 	Matt Damon does do a good job in the title role.  He is very believable as someone who has lost all touch with himself and suddenly finds people all converging with his face in their scope.  He is pretty phenomenal in the action sequences and they were quite surprising in their ferocity.  This movie is full of action but make no mistake, it is definitely PG-13 oriented as most of it is bloodless. 	Most of the rest of the actors have meaningless characters and could have been done by anyone.  Character actor Chris Cooper, Lone Star and The Patriot, is wasted as the 'villain' and Julia Stiles, Save the Last Dance, is almost non-existent in her role. 	Did I hate the movie?  Not particularly but I was not totally entertained. It had some great moments but they were few and far between so I give it a grudging **",Null,0,1,17 June 2002
American Beauty," A Remarkeable Film
","American Beauty:	Have you ever just gone through the motions of life? You get your degree, get married, have the requisite child, and then go on autopilot. Day after day you struggle out of bedÂ…maybe kiss your wife helloÂ…maybe notÂ….grunt at your child and struggle in to work. You manage to smile and slink your way through the day and then it is back home again. You struggle through a meal with your wife and child where neither pays the least bit of attention to you and then it is off to bed. This is where it really gets fun since your wife wants to have nothing to do with you at this point. How would this make your feel or act? Better yet how would you act if suddenly you woke up and saw what was happening to your once promising life? American Beauty, directed by Sam Mendes, and written by Alan Ball explores this scenario and the consequences that follow. 	Lester Burnam has the life I described above. His wife, Carolyn, and his daughter, Jane, really have nothing to do with him. Carolyn has become the homemaker from hell with perfect meals accompanied by the sound track to South Pacific every night. She makes a living outside of the house as a real estate agent and seems to be having more success at it than Lester does in his job with a magazine, and she doesn't let Lester forget this. Lester's daughter Jane is going through all the typical high school angst trying to figure out where she fits in and she has no interest in having Dad as part of her life. 	Everything changes the night Carolyn drags Lester out to see Jane and her dance team perform at the high school game. As Lester blearily observes the performance his eyes are slowly drawn towards Jane's friend, Angela. While he is watching her something in him begins to awaken and stir. She is a blond vision of sex drenched dreams. 	Shortly thereafter Lester attends a work function with his wife. While Carolyn is making eyes with the top realtor in the area, Lester comes upon his new teenage neighbor working as a waiter. They end up out back in the alley talking about life and, well for lack of a better word, smoking dope. When the headwaiter appears to chastise his errant waiter Lester is amazed to see him tell his boss where he can stick his job. The creature that was stirred by Angela is now fully inspired. 	Throughout the rest of the movie we see how Lester reacts to everyone that formerly had some means of control over him. The consultant at his job, his wife, and even his daughter are amazed but not necessarily pleased by the new Lester. The movie continues from this point showcasing how Lester, Carolyn, and Jane all react to the changes in life and how it effects each of them. 	Kevin Spacey plays Lester as if he was born to this role. He starts off the movie barely able to move from room to room. The bathroom scene shows how is wife has affected him and his despair at going to work shows through as he is barely able to stay awake. His wife runs roughshod over him and he crumbles. When he begins to undertake his transformation Spacey takes us a little step each time showing the Lester that once was as he comes forward. Spacey's timing and dialogue skills are shown to great heights throughout. He turns a simple sentence, `I rule!' into a battlecry for all downtrodden men. Very few actors could have handled this as well. 	Annette Bening, as Carolyn, also does a fine job as his wife however many people could have handled this role as well. She runs the gambit from total controlling wife/mother to falling apart woman but something was missing in how she did it. 	Thora Birch, Jane, handled her part better than Bening. She had the teenager embarrassed to be seen with the parents down to a t. At the same time she also had her own awakening to the fact that she didn't always have to play second fiddle to her star friend. 	This was an exceptionally well written movie. It did have some `artsy-fartsy' moments in it that slowed some of the scenes down but Spacey powered through them in one of his best performances yet. I highly recommend this film. ***1/2",Null,0,0,17 February 2002
Spider-Man," It was well worth the wait (SPOILERS)
","(WARNING: THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS)Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is somewhat of your typical high-school nerd.  He is a borderline genius who can't handle a simple conversation with the girl next door who he has loved for years, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  He works on the school paper, has coke-bottle thick glasses, and is spindly at best.  No wonder he is the point of all cruel jokes.  One day when the school is touring a science lab they go through an exhibit where scientists are trying to genetically mutate spiders combine all the individual powerful attributes of spiders into one 'super-spider.' Unfortunately they don't know that one is missing.  Parker finds it as it bites him on the hand.  The rest of the day is a blur as he feels himself getting more and more sick.  When he returns to his Aunt and Uncle's house that night he passes out and has strange dreams involving the spider. The next day things are different.  Peter finds he doesn't need his glasses and he appears to have gone from scrawny to having the body of a gymnist as he slept.  Stranger things are beginning to happen as his hands stick to things and a weird web-like substance is coming out of his wrist. After he defeates the school bully in a joke of a fight he finds himself running in panic into an alley.  When he remembers the bite on his hand he begins to have an idea and, being the scientist that he hopes to be, he tries an experiment.  Before he knows it he is crawling up the side of a building and jumping the roof tops.  He is even learning how to shoot the webs from his wrist. Like most teen-agers who suddenly have power he decides that with a lot of money would come the girl of his dreams.  Parker enters a professional wrestling ring for an exhibition bout dressed as 'The Amazing Spider-Man' and promptly destroys the giant of a man.  Unfortunately things begin going to his head and he lets a robber get away from him with devestating consequences.  Suddenly he learns to his horror that, 'With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility.'  Parker uses a newly designed costume as well as increased skill with his powers to help the citizens of New York. Unfortunately Parker is not your average super-hero.  He isn't rich and doesn't have a trust fund so while battling crime on the side, he also has to find a place to live, get a job, see about getting into college, take care of his Aunt, and oh yeah...dare we forget that with the rise of a super-hero and villain is bound to appear? Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is the father of Parker's best friend. He is rich, a brilliant inventor, and after ingesting a super-soldier type formula, quite insane.  Osborn dons the exo-skelton he had been designed for the military as well as stealing a glider and is quickly dubbed The Green Goblin by the press.  As we all know, the two will eventually battle.  The real question is how Parker is going to handle battling a villain who he frequently hangs out with for dinner when Norman drops by to see his son, Harry. This was really well-worth the wait.  Fans of the comic will really not have too many complaints.  Sure they have changed some things for simple continuity but nothing great has been changed.  People who haven't read the comic will also be able to follow this introductory story (since there will most certaintly be a sequel). Sam Raimi directs this with much of the style that he has done similar features previously with the Evil Dead series.  This has many dark tones but is also infused with the humor that helps move the story along.  There were a few slow moments but overall nothing that would cause the fans to lose interest.  The special effects are worth every penny that has been paid. Certainly many things do look computer generated but it is done in such as style as to closely mimic the drawings that would appear in the comic. Casting was always a major worry in this movie.  Many people, such as myself, were worried to hear that Tobey Maguire had been cast.  Sure he had done a wonderful job in The Cider-House Rules and certainly he had held his own in the idiotic Wonder Boys, but casting him as Spider-Man???  Well, I have to apologize to Mr. Maguire because he certainly did a wonderful job hear.  He definitely was able to handle the dramatic moments and also carried more than a certain sly charm that allowed him to do the trade-mark quips that fans of Spider-Man have come to expect.  He also has spent an incredible amount of time with the personal trainers and that showed.  I for one will willingly back him for the sequels and hope that we don't have a fiasco similar to Batman with the actor changing each film. Willem Dafoe is probably 'the weakest link' in the movie and that is more from the writing of his character than how he does.  I think that at times they made his acting a tad too comic-bookish if you will but that really wouldn't be his fault. I approached this movie with a certain amount of trepidation and yet enthusiastically.  Spider-Man is a comic-book hero that many can identify with since he seems to have the most human problems of them all. Thankfully the writers and direction of the movie all worked exceptionally well.",Null,0,0,6 May 2002
American History X," Powerful movie
","Written by David McKenna and somewhat controversially directed by Tony Kaye, this movie should disturb you with its frightening vision and at the same time entrance you with the wonderful performances. Ed Norton received a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar Nomination this year for the lead role of Derek. The supporting cast includes Edward Furlong, Stacey Keach, and Avery Brooks.  They carry their weight as the story unfolds. 	The story is primarily told through the eyes of Derek's younger brother Danny, played by Edward Furlong. At the beginning of the story Danny is in trouble yet again for writing a paper on that most misunderstood figure, Adolph Hitler. Danny is an up and coming member of the Skin-Head gang located in that area of California. Avery Brooks, appearing as Danny's principal, doesn't want to give up on the promises he sees in Danny. Instead of throwing him out, he assigns another paper to be written. This is to be on Danny's older brother, Derek, who was just released from prison that morning. Derek was the head of the Skin-Head gang that Danny is currently running with. The rest of the movie flashes back and forth from the past to the present. Through Danny's paper we see how Derek, a brilliant student, is turned into a bitter teen-ager that believes only through `white-power' will he get anywhere in life. We also see the tragic night that causes Derek to be justly imprisoned. In the present phase of the movie we encounter a Derek who has grown intellectually while in prison and will now do anything to get his brother out of the trap he allowed himself to be drawn into. 	Ed Norton is wonderful in this role. Those who have seen him in previous roles remember him to be a good actor but built on a rather slight frame. Here he has bulked himself up to be the `Aryan Superman' his character portrays. During the time frame of the movie he carries us convincingly on the journey from embitter teenager to enlightened young adult.	Strong warning though. This movie well deserves it's R rating. The subject matter alone is disturbing enough. The story is also visually graphic with scenes of violence and rape. If you are prepared for something like this I highly recommend this movie. The story is extremely powerful and the performances by all are moving. I strongly recommend this one! ****",Null,0,0,27 March 2002
The Transporter," Pure Fun
","Jason Statham is the Transporter.  For the right price he will deliver your package wherever it is supposed to go, no questions asked.  Unfortunately he makes the cardinal mistake one day and finds out what the package is.  His employers take exception to this and the action/adventure slugfest is running at full speed.  This movie has a mediocre plot (the romance that blossoms and the immigrant storyline is somewhat cheesy) that is quite simply saved by the impressive direction and choreography of the action.  I have previously seen Statham only in supporting roles but here he proves that he has the ability to carry an action lead.  Sure, the character is the familiar quiet man who doesn't want to be pushed, but when push comes to shove he is more than able to deliver.  I found the movie to be well shot, extremely stylish, and somewhat substantive.  If anything, it was the best action rush in awhile at the theater.",Null,0,0,28 October 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," I couldn't stand this movie
","This movie wowed the critics and audiences alike in America and is a major disappointment in China.  I hate to say it but I agree with the Chinese.  Maybe the description as a romantic martial-arts epic should have been enough warning. 	Chow Yun Fat is the aging warrior who decides to hang up his sword apparently to begin hanging out with his female counterpart, Michelle Yeoh. On her last mission she takes the super-sword to the hours of their leader and it is promptly stolen by a female ninja.  Chow shows up and they get the sword back after quickly figuring out it was stolen by the spoiled brat daughter of, I think, the Governor.  It seems her governess is the under-cover Jade Fox, the villain who killed Chow's master.  Now Chow is out for revenge on Jade Fox and at the same time offering to teach the daughter because he sees unlimited potential.  Super warrior Michelle Yeoh is pining away for Chow and there is a desert pirate who has come to town looking for the daughter, who is about to be forced into marriage, because they love each other. 	AAAARRRRRGGGGHHHHH...This was ridiculous.  First there was no chemistry between Chow and Michelle.  Second there were too many story-lines competing to the detriment of the whole.  Third a good portion of this was shot at night in what was supposed to be ancient China which meant, you got it, limited light thus limiting the ability to see.  Fourth the martial arts scenes were sorely lacking.  Sure the choreography was great when they were on the ground but they were so over the top with the wire work that it quickly became something out of a comic book and a bad comic book to boot. Fifth ---

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Wonderful Film
","It's Christmas time and Peter Jackson has brought us a most wonderful present with the second installment of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Is it as much of a present to fantasy fans as last years Fellowship? Most definitely.(possible spoilers)As the first movie ended, the fellowship had been broken into three separate groups. Merry and Pippin had been captured by Uruk-Hai Orcs, Sam and Frodo had continued their journey to Mordor to destroy the ring, and the remaining members; Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn had begun pursuit of the captured hobbits. Pretty exciting way to start a movie if you ask me. The three stories are seamlessly interweaved throughout and the jumping back and forth doesn't harm the continuity of the movie in the slightest.Sam and Frodo meet up with the most exciting CGI character in years in the presence of Gollum. Gollum is devoted towards retaining his 'precious' yet through some coaxing from Frodo his original personality does surface occasionally and aid the hobbits.Merry and Pippin's story is the slightest part of the movie. They escape from the captors when the fabled Riders of Rohan attack and find themselves saved from further injury by Treebeard the Ent. Fans of the original series will be excited to see the addition of the Ent's to the battles.The main storyline focuses on the final three. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn begin their quest for the captured hobbits but find they have lost the trail after the previously mentioned attack. When they meet a 'lost' friend, they realize that they must turn their attentions to aiding Theodan, the King of Rohan. The grand moment of the movie centers on the Battle of Helm's Deep as the hero's attempt to defend against an army of 10,000. It was simply speaking, breathtaking.Peter Jackson ably repeats his success in this movie. It clocks in at just about 3 hours and the time seems to truly fly as you are watching it. There aren't many slow moments at all during the filming and there is definitely the appropriate amount of development throughout.Even though the films have been shot back to back, it seems that the actors have grown much more comfortable throughout the process. My favorites by far have to be those of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Aragorn is the born leader of men and his companions have developed a friendship and rivalry that amuses during the battle sequences. Some of the moves that are done during this almost hour-long scene of carnage are spectacular.The computer generated Gollum is a wonderful addition and, as voiced/acted by Andy Serkis, is almost as believable as the others. The addition of Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky) as Wormtongue is perfect. He slimes his way through all his scenes in a most disturbing manner. My only complaint casting wise is with Elijah Wood. He is doing a fine job as Frodo but for my tastes would have been better cast as an elf.It has been a year since I read this chapter in the story and I don't remember it perfectly. I know this was a relatively well done adaptation which stands on it's own as a truly entertaining piece of filmmaking.",Null,0,0,22 December 2002
Men in Black II," weak story but great chemistry
","It's that time of year again.  The sun is high in the sky beaming that heat down, the grills are going full blast cooking the hotdogs and hamburgers, the fireworks are just about to go off, and Will Smith has a movie out for the 4th of July.  This time it is a sequel to that surprise hit, Men In Black. The story finds Will as Agent Jay, the top agent for the MIB, constantly searching for a replacement for Agent Kay, Tommy Lee Jones, who he had to neuralyze at the end of the previous movie.  Unfortunately Jay is beginning to get a reputation as someone who will use his 'flashy-thing' at the first problem and most of the other personal at MIB are scared of him.  Even worse an extremely dangerous alien by the name of Serleena, Lara Flynn Boyle, has traveled to earth searching for the Light of Zartha.  Naturally if she gets she will be able to rule the universe.  Even worse than we previously thought, the only person who knows where this Light of Zartha is, is Agent Kay who, since his neuralyzation, has been working as the postmaster of a small town. Jay is sent to retrieve Kay, de-neuralyze him so that he will get his memory back, find the Light of Zartha, and defeat Serleena.  Not bad for a 90 minute movie. OK.  This is MIB ll.  You obviously aren't coming in to see this for serious drama.   You probably aren't coming to see this for serious character development either.  You probably are coming because you are a fan of light action/comedies and are a fan of Will Smith and/or Tommy Lee Jones. With that groundrule stated, does this movie work?  Yes. The plot is basically superfluous to the movie.  It seems hastily thrown together and comes across more as the plot for an ongoing television series (sequel anyone?) than for a major motion picture.  What moves this along is the acting of the two leads and the relationship between them. I have often said that there is a great lack of chemistry in many romantic movies out there today.  That doesn't apply here at all.  Smith and Jones work perfectly together.  The chemistry that flows between the two is easy and established quite well.  Smith, as Jay, is the gung-ho top guy at MIB until he brings Kay back and then he easily slips right back into the student role.  Smith is the perfect class clown for this role but he needs a foil and Jones provides Kay with the perfect deadpan that frequently comes across funnier than the joker. Is this the best movie ever made?  Not particularly.  Did I find it entertaining?  Yes.  The two actors work well together and carry the movie to a satisfying end.",Null,0,0,7 July 2002

In this courtroom thriller, William Friedkin directs a slate of Oscar winners and nominees all facing the question of; would the U.S. Government try to shaft one man to save face to the world at large? 	Samuel L. Jackson plays Colonel Terry Childers. He was in charge of a rescue mission in Yemen that went terribly out of control. It seems the U.S. Embassy in Yemen was facing a `peaceful' demonstration of rock throwing, molatov cocktails, and sniper fire. This directly led to Ambassador Mourain, Ben Kingsley, screaming for an evacuation team, as he feared for his family's lives. 	Childers team arrives and sees Mourain and his family to safety. Before leaving the Embassy Colonel Childers orders his team to open fire on the protesters with the result being 83 deadÃ‚â€¦many of them women and children. Naturally this creates an international incident and Childers is ordered to stand ready for a court-martial. 	Bruce Greenwood plays the government official William Sokal who has the one piece of evidence which could exonerate Childers. He has the only tape which survived the demonstration and it shows all the protesters, women and children included, pulling out guns and firing on the embassy, However Sokal feels it would look better to the world to show them crucifying the `evil' American who murdered these innocents. He has Major Mark Biggs, played by Guy Pearce, lead the prosecution. 	Childers hires his long time friend, Colonel Hayes Hodges, to defend him. Tommy Lee Jones plays Hodges as a washed up old lawyer with a drinking problem. Years earlier in Vietnam, Hodges and Childers had been leading a team, which came under enemy fire. Because of Childers, Hodges lived but injuries forced him to sit behind a desk, as he was unable to face combat for the rest of his term in the military. Hodges realizes that this is a Kangaroo court designed to convict Childers but begins to feel the fire of combat and dives to Childers defense with gusto. 	Overall this was a very good movie. It is hard to find two better actors than Tommy Lee and Samuel L. and these men deliver once again. Childers is the consummate Military man. He has no life outside of the Military and would not be able to survive if forced out. Not only is he facing the outrage of the prosecution but also he is beginning to wonder if everything he has ever done for the Military has been wrong. Hodges on the other hand just wants to retire and learn to fly fish. He has served his 30 years and managed to stay away from major problems during that time. Now he is being forced in front of his biggest opponent and it is up to him to protect the man he quite literally owes his life. 	The plot has some wholes however the acting pushes you right through them, Friedkin directs the combat scenes masterfully. The tension builds throughout until the actually blaze of gunfire is almost a relief. The courtroom scenes are almost as tense but we have seen as good if not better in other movies. Would the movie have succeeded as well with other actors in the lead role? Probably not. Jones and Jackson carry this through with their dialogue-devouring prowess.",Null,0,1,27 March 2002
X2: X-Men United," I love comics
","X2:  X-Men UnitedIt's that time of year that the movie industry and the public look forward to with equal amounts of trepidation and glee.  It's that time of year when the birds are singing, the sun is shining, grass is growing, and all things old are new again. Yes, you got it, it's the time for sequels to hit the theater.  X2 leads the pack with it's recent release. The only question is can it surpass the original or does it fall victim to the dreaded, sequelitis?  Let it be known...it is GOOD!(possible spoilers)Logan has returned from his journeys in search of his past.  Nothing is really any more clear than when he left Xavier's school at the end of the original movie.  Unfortunately the team is moving quickly in different directions.  Storm and Jean Grey have headed to Boston tracking a possible evil mutant and the Professor and Cyclops have headed to visit their old enemy Magneto, still residing in the plastic prison he was encased in when last we saw him.  Logan reluctantly agrees to stay and watch the students as the rest leave on their missions.As Storm and Jean Grey discover the mutant in Boston known as Nightcrawler, the mansion comes under a military led attack.  Some of the students are captured however the majority are able to escape due to the efforts of Logan and some of the older students.  Fortunately Logan, Rogue, Bobby Drake (Iceman), and the student known as Pyro are able to meet back up with Storm and her compatriots.  Unfortunately the Professor and Cyclops seem to have totally disappeared.  Even more unfortunate for them, Magneto has been able to escape from his prison with the aid of Mystique and has now offered to align with the team.  It seems he knows where their mutual enemy is and why he has captured the Professor. If our heros and villains are not able to work together as one team, then all of mutant kind may soon be at risk.As a longtime fan of Marvel Comics I admit that for years I was disappointed with the attempts at translating the characters to the big screen.  I approached the original X movie with some fear and was happily surprised.  I didn't think the story was that great since the majority of it was taken up explaining the characters but I was happy.  This movie doesn't have that problem.  It has a good, thought-out plot and it moves with a quick pace that doesn't cause one to wonder how long they have been in the theater.The biggest success I can see for this movie comes from the totally reuniting of the original cast and director.  Bryan Singer returns as director and he understands the pacing which is needed.  He knows the amount of exposition to deliver and when the action needs to be kicked up a notch, and when he kicks the action up a notch it is spectacular. I don't believe we ever really got to see Logan cut loose in the first movie but here, oh my goodness!  I realize that their are other members of the team but this one focuses much on the arguably most popular character and it succeeds.  Saying that though, we do have the introduction of many characters and hints at even others further to come. The mansion sequence was a treat for knowledgeable fans as you spent the time remembering who the students were simply from the use of their powers.All of the actors are superb in their roles.  Patrick Stewart has long been the dream of many as Professor X and he succeeds admirably. Brian Cox (the original Hannibal) plays the 'main' villain, Commander Stryker, with complete self-rightous evil.  The standouts are of course Hugh Jackman, Logan/Wolverine, and Ian McKellen, Magneto.  The two of them have mega-charisma and the story always moves up to another level when they are on the screen.As you can guess, I highly liked this and strongly recommend it for fans and non-fans alike.  I will give this a split rating because I believe non-fans will find it good but not understand as well the attention to detail that has been given.  Sure, a few things have been changed to fit the content of the screen but overall this adaptation was incredibly well done and it will most definitely be a part of the collection.  3/4 for non-fans and 4/4 for fans.",Null,0,0,7 May 2003
The Matrix," good...but not great
","I had a chance to see Andy and Larry Wachowski's ground breaking thrill ride a minute movie, The Matrix, last night. I have to say that as writers the two brothers are very good Directors. 	The story is fairly straightforward. It seems that our reality is not really our reality but a computer generated one and the year is somewhere close to 2200. The computers harvest babies and use them as giant batteries to keep the computer generated world running as they see fit. A few special people are able to break out of this dream life and begin their battle against the computers. One group, led by Morpheus, is searching for the mythical 'One'. A man who will be able to fight the computers with their own strengths and lead humanity back to the pinnacle of life where we once existed. Morpheus believes he has found this person when he finds Neo. The rest of the story details the training of Neo, the discovery of a traitor in their ranks, and the eventual battle between Neo and the Agents of the computer. 	The special effects and the action sequences keep this movie going. Unfortunately nothing truly spectacular occurs in any of these sequences. I am not saying they were bad there have just been better sequences in many other movies. For the most part the actors do their best with the roles they have been given. Laurence Fishburn tackles the role of Morpheus and gives the performance we have come to expect from him. He is able to draw attention to himself at any time without saying a word and when he speaks his voice wraps itself around you and transports you away with its power. Carrie-Ann Moss plays Trinity. She is, in a word, BAD...and that's good. It has been a long time since we have seen quite as tough a woman in film. Ripley would be proud of her. 	Now we come to Neo. Keanu Reeves has done a good job as an action hero before. This time he is passable but that is all. Some scenes, like when he walks through the metal detector and unleashes an arsenal are great. Other scenes don't work as well. His acting ability has frequently been in question and this is one of those times. The first half of the movie his dazed expression is completely befitting of a character who is bombarded with the information he is receiving. Unfortunately that expression stays on him the rest of the movie. Remember my comments concerning the power of Fishburn's voice? Keanu is not blessed with the same gift. In fact at all times he sounds as if he is stoned beyond belief. Though the story is silly and meanders off on different tangents I am not saying I disliked this movie. I will say that it wasn't the be all and end all of Sci-Fi/Action movies. However it was relatively entertaining and I am not sorry I went.",Null,0,0,27 March 2002
Hart's War," pretty good
","Colin Farrell plays Lt. Hart, a p.o.w. (and law school graduate) in a German Camp.  He is forced to defend one of his fellow prisoner's by the commanding officer of the prisoner's when the man is accused of murdering one of the fellow prisoners.  All of the court-room drama is designed to hide the attempts by the prisoner's to do their country proud. 
The pacing of the movie was well done.  It rarely dragged and both the outside war scenes and the court room intrigue kept the interest level high. The movie had a multiple levels of war throughout as there was the obvious war going on outside the camp, as there was multiple ones inside the camp dealing with racism and betrayal.Performances were excellent by all involved.  Colin Farrell continues to impress and Bruce Willis, as the commanding officer of the inmates, continues to show how he is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood.",Null,0,1,3 November 2002
