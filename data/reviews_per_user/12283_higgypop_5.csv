Requiem for a Dream," Excellent and very disturbing movie
",Requiem is brilliant I was totally involved from start to finish. I was moved to nearly tears and unfortunately I could not help but think of my friend while watching it. Brilliant use of visuals and sound well worth watching.,10,0,0,3 February 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Makes the first 2 pointless!
","I loved the Matrix. It was one of the greatest films I had ever seen and was full of anticipation for the sequel. When The Matrix Reloaded was released I was quite disapointed but thought well it wont be that bad if the 3rd installment is up to scratch... Oh dear!The Matrix Revolutions is a pointless excersise. yes the effects are amazing (but a little cliche nowerdays) but the story is absolute rubbish.
SPOILER ALERTThe film ends with Neo finally defeating Agent Smith and ridding the matrix of him forever. Does he destroy the matrix? NO! the computers basicly give mankind the choice of whether to live in the matrix or not. But why would you want to leave?. Outside is a baron dead planet inside a beautiful exact replica of 20th century earth. i know which one i would rather be in. So in the end of neo's battle we end up exactly the same as we were just without agent smith. YayThe 2nd and 3rd installments are pointless luckily the first movie stands alone well enough to just have that in your collection.
Bitterly disapointing.",2,0,1,4 July 2004
American Gangster," Very Good But Nothing New
","I found American Gangster to be an enjoyable film, it was very well acted across the board (but with a cast including Denzel,Russel Crowe and Cuba Gooding Jr you really don't expect anything less.However I found that American Gangster really didn't add anything new to the Genre, and although it was equally well directed and acted it seemed to be trying to be the Departed and did not try to add anything to give the film it's own style.One major plus note for this film is actually seeing Cuba Gooding Jr getting a decent acting role again (after whoring himself off in rubbish family tripe for years on end). The man is a brilliant actor and hopefully American Gangster will see him actually use his considerable talent.All in all a very good film but it's lack of ingenuity stops it from getting a higher mark.",8,0,2,1 December 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Speechless
","Just got back from a midnight screening of the film for which i have been waiting for 20 years. And i'm just about to go see it again.My main reaction after leaving the cinema was one of 'Ok now what did I think of that?'. To tell the truth seeing Revenge was a very strange experience. What put me off guard as soon as the film started was how different visually ROTS is to any of the other Star Wars films, Lord Lucas seems to have been taking lessons in cinematography as The Star Wars galaxy has never looked so damn good. All the characters now seem to have a new lease of life (especially a very sprightly R2-D2).Some cringe worthy dialogue aside the acting is far superior to Phantom and Clones. Hayden has really grown into his role as Anakin, gone is the moaning youth of Attack of the Clones and in comes a more mature and moody future dark lord.Anakin and Obi-Wans relationship is really wonderful to watch in the first half of the film and you can see the disappointment and anguish in Obi Wan's eyes when his Padawan turns on the jedi.Other great moments include the fight between Mace and Palpatine (An Amazing performance by Ian Mcdiarmid) and the duel between Yoda and Palpatine.As always with these prequels there are a few niggling things that hold it back. Some of the plot seems a little rushed, Anakin's fall to the darkside could have done with a little more screen time to properly show the turmoil he was going through (but is effective none the less). Also some of the dialogue is absolutely atrocious (only one man can say those lines with any credibility and thats Harrison Ford).In addition ROTS (on first viewing) seems to be a collection of set pieces (like a best of Star Wars fights DVD might look) maybe this is because they are the most standout things I have yet seen in a Sci-Fi film. Further viewing is needed I believe (like an album it sometimes takes a few listens to properly appreciate it).So was Revenge of the Sith worth the wait, this is the last new Star Wars film i will ever see, Was this the film to bind the trilogys together to make a satisfying 'Space Opera'... HELL YES! Go see it now, Go see it more than once because I think you need to, to fully grasp the scope and feeling of this movie.Oh and one more thing the ending is brilliant really sets up Episode IV.Thankyou George Lucas you have made mine and many many peoples lives much richer.",9,7,15,19 May 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," WOW!
","Well i have just got back from seeing what has to be greatest movie I have ever seen!. Never before have I sat in a Cinema with my mouth open, tears of joy running down my face. Peter Jackson has created a modern marvel, an all time classic. On it's own The Return of the King is an amazing film but standing alongside the others makes The Lord of the Rings trilogy the greatest fantasy saga of all time!.
Brilliant Just Brilliant!",10,0,0,17 December 2003
