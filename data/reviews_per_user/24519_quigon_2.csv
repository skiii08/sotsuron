Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What is everyone complaining about? It's GREAT!
","The Phantom Menace, in and of itself, is a great movie.  I stress 'in and of itself' because Star Wars is one of the greatest movies of our time, and you cannot expect a Citizen Kane of every movie in a series. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't perfect.  Jar Jar wasn't an annoying character, but his voice was obnoxious, and trying to understand him was at times a nearly impossible task.  The special effects were breathtaking, so much so that they upstaged the actors in many cases.  I think Lucas should cut back on his CGI use; it gets excessive at times.  There are many long sequences with no human acting; it gets almost too cartoony.  Finally, the characters were grossly underdeveloped, particularly Darth Maul, who could have been portrayed like another Vader as opposed to a mute comic book character.  A tough, scary, and truly bad comic book character, to be sure.In any case, despite its shortcomings, the movie is an instant classic. I can't wait to see it again.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
The Mummy," Lots of fun, worth seeing
","The mummy was a truly entertaining film.  It combined Indiana Jones with supernatural horror / suspense, and it worked well.  The effects were unbelievable, and Fraser's one-liners were great.  It's definitely worth seeing.",Null,0,0,8 May 1999
