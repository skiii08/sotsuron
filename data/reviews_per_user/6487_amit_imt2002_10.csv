Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 is back in form..OK somewhat!
","Tony Stark is the kind of billionaire inventor playboy genius that must make Richard Branson and Larry Ellison feel like under achievers or worse-downright wimpish. 'I'm Tony Stark. I build neat stuff, got a great girl, and occasionally save the world,' yeah, way cooler than Steve Jobs. The appearance of the Oracle brand in Iron Man 3 is perhaps Ellison making a donation to become part of the super alpha male club, because the guys who buy Oracle servers are not going to be swayed by this film.The story starts off in the post The Avengers world, with Tony Stark having retreated to his workshop to create a plethora of suits.But all is not well in the world, there have been mysterious explosions which have a unique signature to them.The back story belongs to a science conference in 1999 when Stark ignored the entreaties of a partially disabled scientist Aldrich Killian(Guy pierce) to work with him and ended up creating a monster.While he was at it he also had a one night stand with an ace scientist Maya Henson (Rebecca Hall) and left her in the lurch.His life with his girlfriend Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow) is strained. He is going through a superhero midlife crisis, and a 'what else is there to achieve, now that I am the CEO of Starks Corp. and his permanent girlfriend' emptiness in hers.Meanwhile the evil Aldrich meets Pepper and makes a presentation, taking her inside the hologram of human brain that will make the consultants at Bain and Co. sweat,trust me its sleek.But Pepper is not impressed, it sounds like evil science to her.With this final rebuff all bets are off and Peppers bodyguard Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) gets hurt in another mysterious blast.This snaps Stark back to his superhero mode and he calls for war with the new threat to humankind, Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), an Asian looking anarchist, who by now is making global broadcasts about his intention to teach the world painful lessons. Aldrich has also harnessed a technology that can regenerate damaged human tissue and has cured himself.He is looking to commercialize his invention.The rest of the film continues to carry on the special effects feast with the Iron Man slugging it out with the evil Mandarin and Aldrich.Hell hath no fury like a scientist scorned.The director charms us in the middle act in a Spielberg kind of way by introducing the all American blond kid who helps Stark when he is down and out and gets a payback which will earn him a fortune on Ebay one day.After the definitive cinematic death of Bin Laden in Zero Dark Thirty, Hollywood seems to be taking a break from terrorists with long beards, in the recent Olympus has Fallen, Hollywood looks to North Korea for pure evil.Tragically real life seems to follow suit in Boston where at least outwardly the killers were white Caucasian men.Maybe next time around we will have a secret society of Russian oligarchs facing off with the Marvel crew.While the novelty of the suit has worn off despite several reboots, Robert Downey Jr. is superb, this is still one of the most inspired casting calls in Hollywood Superhero history.Gwyneth Paltrow has just been named the most beautiful woman in the world by People magazine, much to the chagrin of feminists who hate her blond slender blue-eyed frame, delivers the goods as Iron Mans weak spot even though he neglects her for his workshop.She shakes off the damsel in distress image to emerge a worthy Mrs Iron Man. Guy Pierce is good as the evil Aldrich Killian but Ben Kingsley's Mandarin sets the screen on fire.His character neatly sidesteps the Fu Mancu stereotype and bears shades of Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now, in his worldview.The first Iron Man film was supremely thrilling in combining special effects and a really original character brought to life by Downey.The second installment instead of building on the first went sideways, though not without its spectacular moments.The third installment which sees a change in the direction department with Shane Black replacing Jon Favreau, tries to go back to basics but the plot does not have the cohesion that the Iron Man 1 had.This is far from a perfect film with more plot holes than there are chinks in the Iron Man's steel suit but a very entertaining and polished product.Its major weaknesses is the length, a full 131 minutes may be bang for the buck or a slight drag depending on whether you are a Marvel comics fanboy or a regular moviegoer. Made on a jumbo budget of USD 200 million, IM3 is worth your time and money for all the fireworks on display, nearly eclipsed by Downey and Ben Kingsley, at their sparkling best.#Iron Man 3 seems to be a test case for Hollywood in China as it goes head to head with a small budget Chinese drama.The Chinese seem to be tired of the Hollywood pyrotechnics which is good news for all of us!",6,3,8,26 April 2013
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," Run Run Run!
","As I lifted my aching bums from the seat after watching this film the uppermost thought in my mind was a silent thank you to the guardian angels of cinema.After all if this is how we approach biopics I am so happy that Gandhi was made by a foreigner 30 years ago.If Bollywood had a shot at it, they would have made the Mahatma do garba and dandiya with Kasturba and his brave experiments with celibacy would have turned to sleaze.There would have been Zulu dancers during his South Africa phase, soulful ghazals when he visits Amritsar in the aftermath of Jalianwala Baag massacre and sufi songs when Hindu Muslim riots break out.There would also have been some Englishman raping a Indian girl and a sexy mujra in the court of a debauched Maharaja.Bhaag Milkha Bhaag tries to tell the story of India's greatest athlete in the only language that Bollywood understands – the musical.Indeed a sporty musical can be done very well as Lagaan demonstrated but this film simply does not have the material to carry off a handful of songs.It all begins at the Rome Olympics in 1960 where Milkha Singh comes fourth in a photo-finish despite being the world record holder and a favorite to win the race.The reason for his poor showing is a backward glance which according to the film is the massacre of his family during the partition coming back to haunt him.Nothing is further from the truth. Milkha Singh lost because he made a strategic blunder in running too fast during the first 250 meters and tried to slow down which cost him the race.That and his being in lane 5 which creates a blind spot and a disadvantage for a sprinter.So much for a biopic!The film ends with a cricket match final.Now how can that be since this film is about athletics? I am lying of course, the director wisely reduces his race in Pakistan to a India Pakistan war as it happens in every Indo-Pak cricket match and ends the film on a jingoistic note! And yes we take a full three hours to reach this convoluted climax.The story of Milkha Singh is a great story, his lost childhood, his parents murder during the partition, his rise to running glory, his infamous loss at the Rome Olympics which led to him hitting the bottle, his win in Pakistan and him turning down the Arjuna Award.But Mr Mehra finds it more important to dwell on his romance while growing up and his one night stand with a hot Australian girl during the Melbourne Olympics.A chiseled Farhan doing push ups at the beach with a buxum bikini clad blond lying on his back should be paisa wasool!To the films credit the races are filmed with great finesse, the training sequences are epic, Farhan Akthar has a body to die for or to kill for and some of the incidents of his early life are very engrossing. Undoubtedly Farhan as Milkha is a casting coup and the effort he puts into becoming Milkha Singh translates into a superlative performance.The big budget is up on the screen, the attention to period detail is exquisite and Binod Pradhan's camera-work top notch. Pawan Malhotra is downright brilliant as his coach.There is this shot when Milkha Singh get taken over by the coach of the national team and Pawan Malhotra looks at him with an expression that is a mixture of pride and sadness, he is loosing his most talented protégée and is happy for him.That shot alone redeems this film.Bhaag Milkha Bhag is a stellar example of a wasted opportunity, this could have been a good film if 70 minutes had been chopped and it could have been a great film if it had focused on Milkha Singh the man and athlete and not on Farhan Akhtar the alpha male with the body of a Greek God.Even after three hours of watching this film we are none the wiser about the profession of running or what it must have been like to be Milkha Singh in the first decade of India's independence or what the legacy of this great athlete is.Bhaag Audience Bhaag!",3,25,42,12 July 2013
Life of Pi," An atheist perspective!!
","Pi Patel is the son of a zoo owner in Pondicherry,India and when the business fails they decide to move to Canada and sell the animals off.The family sets off on a Japanese ship with all the animals on board, much like Noah's ark,only this time the biblical floods have been replaced by Indira Gandhi's emergency.But that does not make it a political film! There is a perfect storm at sea and Pi somehow finds himself adrift in a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a huge Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.The smaller animals fall victim to the food chain and Pi is left alone with the tiger.We are now faced with a simple question, are there two animals on the boat or one human and one animal? This is one of the pillars of our belief system.If we believe the we humans are in a league of our own and above all other animals we fall roughly into the camp of those who also believe in intelligent design and therefore puts us immediately at loggerheads with environmental issues.To accept Darwinian evolution and mix it with spirituality is one of the key challenges and part of the bigger question of reconciling science and religion in a post industrialized world.Children are born atheists and amoral.They acquire morality and faith or a combination of both as the result of a variety of factors driven primarily by parents.My 5 year old daughter is drawn to the creamy layer of Hindu Gods( out of the teeming masses of no less than 33 million) when she listens to stories of the Ramayana and Mahabharata. At school they pray to a secular God everyday.Yet she lives happily in an atheist household.What her beliefs will be I do not know, I merely intent to give her the gift of choice, while gently reinforcing my rationalist standpoint which I regard as my moral duty, just as my parents felt it was theirs to imbibe in me the fear of God.The key question of why Pi was drawn to religion remains open. He ends up a professor of theology.The 200+ day ordeal can change anybody profoundly.The trapped Chilean miners contemplated resorting to cannibalism to survive.Danny Boyles 27 Hours is another true example of the triumph of the human spirit when the protagonist amputates his own arm to survive. So the fictional story of a boy who survived impossible odds should not make us religious. The film is shot magnificently, its a superlative act of visualization to bring this story to the screen and Ang Lee certainly has that gift. Intriguingly, the way he handles the Indian angle of the film and the prelude to the fateful voyage reminds me of Mira Nair's work in The Namesake which was a lesser film but filled with some of the same elements, a boy who grows up with an improbable and embarrassing name, the presence of Irrfan Khan and Tabu and the challenges of an immigrant family in the alien landscape of America as a nuanced adventure, thematically similar to Pi stranded with a tiger in the vast oceans.There is a scene at the end of the film where Pi parts ways with his feline companion.Richard Parker does not look back at Pi to bid him farewell and walks away unemotionally while Pi sobs with heartbreak.The tiger and its fear kept Pi alive, which is an interesting counterintuitive logic where fear keeps us alive.Perhaps an emotional void is mans biggest enemy. As he recounts the story many years later his eyes well up with tears again.We are supposed to feel that humans have a monopoly over emotions and this sets us apart from the rest of the animal kingdom, which is factually incorrect. Richard Parker deserves to be cut some slack as he has just survived an equal or probably even greater ordeal at sea!Mention must be made of Suraj Sharma who went to the audition to accompany his brother but landed the role out of 3000 aspirants.He does an outstanding job as a gangly youth who fights his circumstances with remarkable ingenuity and pluck.But the star of this visual feast must surely be the CGI tiger who looks us in the eye and brings to mind William Blakes classic poem The Tyger( a wonderful way to spell,sadly rectified in our school anthology) from his collection Songs of Experience, which was a sister poem of The Lamb.Pi is the Lamb here.When the Royal Bengal Tiger walks into the pages of history he will not look back with emotion at us humans who proved to be his worst enemies.We will be left wiping away our tears at having lost the most beautiful creature ever to our greed, indifference and arrogance. William Blake's poem brought to life by Ang Lee in the Life of Pi will hopefully survive for our children to fire their imagination.",8,7,15,8 January 2013
The Intouchables," An inspiring and uplifting film.
","A rich aristocratic Frenchman Philippe played by Francois Clouzet, who is quadriplegic is perpetually looking for a caregiver.He is a tough cookie and taking care of his fragile health and erratic temperament mean that most don't last more than a week.We see interviews happening.There is a train of inept candidates even we know won't last long.They already see Philippe as a dead man. In the middle of all this, in walks a giant of a black man.He is well built and full of raw energy.He does not want the job, just a signature attesting that he tried to find a job so he can qualify for social security.He is out on parole, a stock character from the Paris housing projects, the grim underbelly of which has been superbly documented in La Haine.We know immediately he will be hired.Its an immutable law of films, even if the posters and trailer have not given it away already.What follows are a set of adventures the two embark upon turning conventional wisdom on its head. Driss played by the gregarious Omar Sy, has immense physical energy and a love of life that is infectious, he has a mind of his own and is not cowed by the splendor of the mansion in which he finds himself in.Of course he tests the springiness of the mattress and practices his bathroom singing in a luxurious gold rimmed bathtub but those are not too important for him. Philippe indulges him, despite the protests of his friends, he trusts his instincts, probably his last act of rebellion against life which has suddenly been so unfair. The two are polar opposites but begin to share a bond.Phillip likes the fact that Driss does not treat him like a vegetable but a real human being even to the extent of making fun of his disability.If all this sounds like a series of clichés from many other films you are right.But then, cinema thrives on telling the same story again and again because our lives too follow predictable patterns, no matter how hard we try to assert our individuality.What ultimately matters is whether cinema is able to sweep us away in its arc and its joy of telling that story and makes us forget our own dull life. This is what this film does, takes an old premise and infuses raw energy in the narrative.Sy dominates the screen like a giant, his love of life and his refusal to become a part of the vicious cycle of the Parisian immigrant suburban housing estates which are a sad model of exclusion and ghettoisation, sets him apart.Driss shows Philippe a good time.",6,1,3,8 January 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An unexpected delight..a visual treat!
","Peter Jackson is at it again pushing the limits of what the cinematic medium can do.He harnesses the power of 3D and marries it to his innovation of shooting at 48 frames per second.The result is a film which looks almost unreal and beautiful beyond belief. Films are conventionally shot at the rate of 24 frames per second which essentially means that the film camera exposes 24 individual single surface of photographic film in a second and when this is played back it creates the illusion of motion.This convention has served cinema well but shooting at 48 fps gives the film a crispness and brilliance while reducing blur and flicker, the only rival of which is the 70mm format.When the budgets of films have swelled to zillions of dollars spending a few hundred thousand extra on film stock seems logical to achieve a superior look.This film creates a new standard much in the same way that Avatar did when it reinvented 3D technology.While Peter Jackson may not have toiled as hard as James Cameron in the research department his idea of increasing the frame rate manages to achieve a breakthrough.The genres of fantasy adventure and sci fi need something special to keep us engaged with it.There is no dearth of films out there that gives us flying monsters,dragons,cute adolescent heroes, bearded sorcerers and ethereal witches all played by droll and charming British actors.When the makers of the money spinner Lord Of The Ring trilogy (Ben Bernankie could have funded his quantitative easing with the proceeds) turns his mind to bringing a prequel to the big screen the expectations are more than sky high.Jackson used the other worldly landscapes of New Zealand to great advantage in the LOTR trilogy and singlehandedly revived the tourism industry there.But the man is not all flashy effects, his way of story telling with a maddening attention to detail is something that was quite evident even in King Kong where he had us believe that King Kong was indeed in love with Naomi Watts.The scene with her dancing and jumping to impress upon Mr Kong that he should love her and not dash her against a rock is a piece of great direction. The Hobbit was published in 1937 for younger readers unlike the LOTR books which had to contend with the dark shadow of WW2.While the LOTR films deeply divided Tolkien fans about reducing the book to an action adventure instead of the charm of the hobbits who occupied centerstage in the book, The Hobbit starts off on its own terms. In circa 2012 Peter Jackson presents his own version on his own terms for an audience reared on high definition high octane video games.The film displays some of the innocence of Tolkiens book at the beginning with an exuberant impromptu dinner party of dwarfs much to the exasperation of the unwilling host Bilbo Baggins.The middle act, however, treads typical LOTR territory, very competently and full of inventive monsters, ogres, elves and what not.All this of course presented in the 48fps 3D which has none of the dimness of the typical 3D flick.The Hobbit while unable to bring anything spectacularly new to the table in terms of content or storytelling grammar dazzles all through its nearly three hour length on the strength of its technical excellence and fine performances set to stirring background music.This film was made on a budget on 180 million USD which is roughly 1000 crore India rupees. This 'product' can be consumed for about 300 Rupees or 15 USD depending on your location.Its eye popping bang for the buck!!Another way to judge a piece of entertainment is the return on your time.If the Hobbit trilogy runs for 9 hours that will be more than the time taken to read the book. Films deliver us the stories of novels in a fraction of the time taken to read the books and get much vilified in the process.This time the films may need more of our time, cost three times a single copy of the book and come in three installments over 2.5 years.Thats the power of the global blockbuster for you.Oh and I forgot the cost of the popcorn!",9,3,7,8 January 2013
Mama," A very competent horror flick..thats saying a lot!!
","In the opening scene we see a car parked outside a house.The door is open and the car radio can be heard, which informs us that like the last financial crisis this time too (2008) there has been extreme consequences.An analyst working for an investment bank has gone berserk and shot two of his colleagues .He is missing and the police are looking for him.Its a horror film already.But Mama is not the kind of horror film that describes the man made devastation that we wreck upon ourselves.This is a more conventional horror flick full of jumpy moments when you are likely to get startled out of your wits and embarrass yourself in front of your neighbor in the next seat who seems to watching a different film, a comedy perhaps.So a good horror film involves being anxious or jumpy or both, but keeping your body under control.It really helps if you have somebody to lean onto.We enter the house and see the crazed executive Lucas (Nikolaj Koster-Waldau) drive off with his two little girls on an icy mountain road.He has just killed his wife.He is going too fast and even his daughter thinks so.The car skids off the frozen road and they scramble out into the ominous woods.They find an abandoned cottage soon enough, as it always happens, and we know for sure that going in is a stupid idea.But this man has just killed 3 people, he is beyond reason.He is about to kill his daughters and himself when a supernatural being swoops down on him and pulls him away, into hell perhaps.His daughters are left alone in the icy cottage.That they will survive becomes clear and the title credits show us crayon drawings depicting them morphing into subhuman beings and go back to walking on all fours.Jump cut 5 years and Lucases brother Jeffrey, also played by Koster-Waldau, is still on the lookout for his nieces. He is living with his girlfriend Annabel played by Jessica Chastain who is part of a band.One day his hired investigators stumble upon the car and the cottage.They find the girls, they have survived but are completely damaged goods.They end up in the temporary care of a Dr. Dreyfuss who finds the prospect of studying the girls a goldmine of professional opportunity, to be exploited beyond the realm of good sense.The sight of the two little wild girls is one the most terrifying part of the film, we expect them to turn out to be ultra-violent, unpredictable and worse, evil.Instead they turn out to be just innocent children who have been through an unspeakable ordeal. The girls are put into the care of Jeffrey and Annabel who try their best to bring them back into a 'normal' way of life.Of course evil forces are at work.They were in the care of 'mama' in the woods who visits them in their new home, steering clear of the adults.Hereafter the film spirals into a familiar territory of scary jumpy moments, of close brushes with evil, set to nerve- wracking music.Horror is a genre not for the faint hearted, for the directors that is.The task of scaring a new age audience fed an almost daily diet of gore and thrills supplied by TV shows, theme park rides, video games and novelty horror fare like the three installments of Paranormal Activity and counting, is indeed fraught with its own faux horror.Andy Muschetti directs with a quiet assured touch and delivers a fair share of genuine jumpy moments.He uses a completely desaturated colour palette which feels unreal and but does help the film achieve a chilly atmosphere.Mama of course comes tagged with the name of Guillermo del Toro (director of the cult classic Pans Labyrinth) as the executive producer, which must be an assurance of much above-average fare, given his well-earned reputation as a highly inventive and original filmmaker. Muschetti delivers some very stylized flashbacks which provide a back story to the evil in the film.The use of Azetic Black Witch Moths, the same species which had a starring role in The Silence of the Lambs, to underscore the eeriness and offer a link between us and the supernatural, adds a mythic dimension to the film. The ethereal and statuesque Jessica Chastain is the star of this film and indeed the star of the year.She is nominated for Oscar this year for Zero Dark Thirty following her nomination last year for Terrence Malik's Tree of Life.That great film launched Chastain, who has since played an amazing range of roles with astonishing felicity.In Mama she supplies a very credible version of a well-meaning girlfriend who takes great risk in doing the right thing when it comes to the future of two small children.Horror films must either overwhelm us with the scares or supply us with an emotional link to the characters which makes us scared for them and not just ourselves.Mama tried to do both and succeeds partly on both counts.At the heart of the film is the strongest and sometimes the most damning relationship known to us, that of a mother and child.This is the one bond that drives people to unimaginable limits and suggests an almost otherworldly pull. A great many horror films play on the maternal instincts inside all of us, this one spins it into a very enjoyable thrill ride.From my film review blog mostlycinema.com",7,7,15,18 January 2013
Jack Reacher," An atmospheric thriller!
","Jason Bourne is a bit erratic and so is James Bond.Not every year brings one of their adventures and thrills to the screen.The number of fantasy adventure and comic book franchises continues to multiply, not always with good results.So there exists a space for a crime fighter who is endowed with the charm of Bond and the superhuman level of training of Jason Bourne. Enter Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher, based on series of bestseller novels by Lee Child.He is an army investigator who decided to quit and became a phantom.He cannot be found unless he wants to be. When 5 people are killed in a random shooting which obviously has been carried out by a person of sniper level capabilities the police act fast and mine the crime scene to nab a suspect.The case against him appears hermetically sealed.His fingerprints,DNA,shell casings everything matches.The district attorney has a big reputation, the files he picks up to prosecute have a 100% conviction rate and the accused often take the choice he gives them – the chair or life.The suspect this time does neither.He asks for Jack Reacher and in walks Tom Cruise.He wants to be found this time, and turns up very punctually indeed.He informs the investigators that he knows the suspect from the days in service in the gulf.The suspect is indeed a trained shooter and went crazy at the end of his service and shot a few people to scratch his trigger happy fingers.He was let off partly due to Jack Reachers intervention who made a pact that he would be contacted if anything went amiss in future.Reacher examines the evidence and is puzzled, everything fits in too neatly but the modus operandi is at odds with the suspects military training.He would have done it in an easier way, and certainly would not have left the crime scene a goldmine of evidence.Its almost as if he wanted to be caught! We meet the idealist defence attorney Helen played by the beautiful Rosamund Pike. She too is convinced of his guilt but wants to keep him off death row, she has bones to pick with her dad who is the district attorney played a bit unconvincingly by Richard Jenkins, otherwise a superb actor.With this set up we follow the duo on their race to unravel the truth and suddenly the case does seen as straightforward.The action follows the well trodden path of hunting down an elusive mysterious evil character with obscure motives and the hero acting against his training and impulses to save the damsel in distress.The great German director Werner Herzog and veteran actor Robert Duvall provide some solid character to the film in two small but entertaining roles. What they are up to is not my business to disclose here. Tom Cruise occupies most of the screen time in a performance that is at best a mixed bag.He tries to appear mysterious and trying to exercise tremendous self-control in not revealing his superlative mental and physical prowesses.His turn in Michael Mann's Collateral as a ruthless killer worked better, here in Christopher McQuarrie's lesser hands he loses focus at times.It must a pain being Tom Cruise, with endless divorces and getting remarried to approved brides 'arranged' by the Church of Scientology. Jack Reacher is an interesting attempt at selling Tom Cruise as a vigilante type ex cop with the killer instincts of Jason Bourne.He neither has the charm of Bond nor the conflicted character of Bourne.Neither does this work as an extension of his Mission Impossible Ethan Hunt character armed with sexy gizmos and feathering incredible stunts.The interesting thing about this film is the atmosphere it invokes, there are no smartphones in sight and without the few dated cellphones the film could as well have been set in the eighties or even seventies. The black cop who is working the case appears like a seventies Sidney Poitier kind of character down to his suit.His air is that of a racially oppressed soul from the sixties and not a police detective in contemporary America.It is this sense of an unglamorous time and space, which the current lot of films have abandoned, that gives the film its uniqueness. Most striking of course is the crime itself, we seen ordinary people through a rifles telescopic viewfinder.The viewfinder tracks the subjects at random and suddenly five people are dead in what appears chillingly like the many random gun massacres which have happened in the past year in America.The film establishes another kind of potential gun criminal, a crazed war veteran who is trained to kill and cannot do without it.That the kind of weapons used in the army are available in Wall Mart is clearly asking for trouble.The clammy dialogues are another area where the film slips up, you can literally see the screen writer scratching and rewriting the dialogues which appear forced at times.The film draws to a satisfactory close, albeit without a kiss for the girl from Jack Reacher.Watch it if you need a regular dose of crime thrillers. McQuarrie who wrote the brilliant film The Usual Suspects and some not so great films, is a competent director and creates a timeless atmosphere starting with the great opening sequence but needs to deliver more. I suspect with the number of tickets Tom Cruise is selling, Jack Reacher should be back, maybe with another director.As the tagline goes 'The law has its limits.He does not.'",7,5,11,8 January 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Dancing in quicksand..
","Zero Dark Thirty is a compelling film with a real chance of making the largest number of people, yet, to introspect and come to their own conclusions about the war on terror, its troubling origins and its continuing cost.After one Sunday of watching Bin Laden's killing on the news networks, most Americans and the rest of the world went back to business.Several scholarly books and newspaper articles tried to overwhelm us with information and commentary on the greatest manhunt ever.Most of these did not find itself into the consciousness of the masses who continue to struggle with economic realities despite the 'Osama Bin Laden is Dead and General Motors is Alive' rhetoric. Zero Dark Thirty arrives at an opportune time.The debate about torture is meaningless, we will always be willing to kill for stuff that the powerful value, like political mileage.Its a technique as old as the hills.Obama may try to rise above torture, but drone strikes are nothing but a rich nation swatting flies for political gain. Drones are neat, so must have been torture when it was invented.Rendition, the 2007 film by Gavin Hood was an impassioned commentary on torture and put a huge question mark about its effectiveness. Zero Dark Thirty is brilliantly scripted and shot by the team of journalist/screenwriter Mark Boal and veteran director Kathryn Bigelow. It holds our attention for all of its 150 mins runtime, which is remarkable because we all know the ending.In the course of the very complex hunt for Bin Laden we see lots of torture, small victories in eliminating some key players, large losses in the continued terror attracts around the world except on American soil, and more importantly a regime change.We are swept up in the passion of Maya, a low level CIA operative played by the increasingly brilliant Jessica Chastain. She pursues her hunch about a courier with great single mindedness and embodies the promise of both Bush and Obama to hunt down Bin Laden.In its own way its also a film about work, how we approach our jobs and how wide the gamut of human experience can be, if we cared to look.The question of what motivates Maya remains open.She remains an enigma till the very end, true to her name which also means 'illusion' in Sanskrit. How I wish Maya was an environmentalist! The most important events in history take a very long time for society to assimilate.The assassination of JFK has still not been resolved, nor of Mahatma Gandhi.Some of the issues that were at the heart of Gandhi's assassination will surface in 2014 when India goes to the polls.Its just that they will not be linked directly to his death. Perhaps a long way off in the future there will be somebody like Oliver Stone who will rake up the Bin Laden killing to illuminate issues in America but for the moment Zero Dark Thirty must serve as the first cinematic draft of history.This is another milestone in the growing importance of film as the current medium of choice to engage with history. Obama's address to the Islamic world from Cairo, which was dubbed an apology tour, was a step in the right direction and so is a growing reluctance to go to war in far corners of the world.The Iraq war has amply illustrated the futility of shoving profound political change down the throat of a people who will continue to engage in bloody battles on Shia Sunni lines. Zero Dark Thirty shows us the high cost of capturing a high value target, both human and material and the long term cost which must be paid by future generations. A forgotten film by Wim Wenders called Land of Plenty made in 2005 captured a fractured post 9/11 American state in a beautiful and sensitive way. The Clash of Civilizations, a theory proposed by Samual Huntington which identifies cultural and religious differences as the fountainhead of future conflict, is certainly underway.While the world obsesses over the nuclear weapons Iran is building, it conveniently forgets that Pakistan is the most dangerous and unstable owner of a huge nuclear arsenal.When this clash of civilizations takes a turn for the worse, India is likely to be biggest collateral damage in history, thanks to the Pakistani militaries cunning use of India to maintain its grip on that failed state. Charlie Wilson's War was a smart Hollywood comedy which depicted the genesis of the whole Afghanistan/Pakistan crisis that is unfolding today.As a people we continue to dance in quicksand.",9,3,6,25 January 2013
The Croods," Missing story alert!
","The Croods is a big budget animated film with an interesting premise in search of a story.It gives us a sequence after sequence of a cave-dweller family coming to terms with a a very fast changing world that challenges any notions of mortality that we may have about our homo- sapien forefathers.But then its an animated film and death proofness shall not be held against them. Heck! its not the case for any Die Hard film, so a bunch of animated characters have all the right to survive rough landings from zillion foot high cliffs.And since the primary audience for this latest Dreamwork's ' product' is likely to be children accompanied by guilt ridden parents it can be safely assumed that all the cute slapstick action will hit home with its core tiny- tot audience.As the cave painting inspired credits roll we are introduced via voice-over to the The Crood family led by a brawny father named Grug, who guards his flock with a fierce adherence to the laws of survival he has learned the hard way.It involves as less interaction with the outside world as possible, which means spending much time in a claustrophobic cave and killing all notions of curiosity, which killed not just the cat but most of his brethren. This goes against the nature of his vivacious daughter Eep who craves to see what lies outside the cave.The premise is as old as the hills and the Neanderthal man.Soon enough her wishes are answered and they find themselves catapulted into a world very different from the one they knew and they must survive and make up new rules along the way.As it turns out the only new rule they need, is that there are no rules, and they must use a part of the body they haven't paid much attention to thus far – namely the brain.Grug says he doesn't need brains and flexes his muscles to illustrate his hair brained point.His foil in the new psychedelic, dangerous and seductively beautiful world is Guy, who is a young chap with the gumption of Tom Sawyyer and Huck Finn rolled into one, the type that young girls that cant help but fall in love with.Guy and his success in saving their fur covered behinds on countless occasions makes Grug jealous and insecure as the gang stumbles from one deadly animal attack to another.They will discover fire, grey matter and importantly shoes in the process.The cry of ecstasy that Eep lets out when she first wears a pair of boots tells us that in the very distant future a certain Mr Jimmy Choo will become a billionaire and male-kind's nemesis.The Croods examines its characters with the same nonchalance that Grug makes drawings on caves to illustrate his 'put you head in a hole in the ground theories' and undoubtedly his doodles will not make art loves swoon like they do over the Bulls in the Altamira caves in Spain.The film limits itself to following the escapades of grumpy father, cutie pie daughter and cocky wise Guy at the expanse of the rest of the family and creates only unpredictable nature as the adversary.The Croods is full of slapstick comedy and has none of the dialogues and word play that will amuse the accompanying adults.It has no story and little character development, not to speak of a background score that could have lifted the film up, when it threatens to sag under the weight of its animation showiness.Small children will love its a gag a minute format but older children, I suspect, will see through its severe limitations.The film has a star cast of big names doing voiceovers but I found none of the distinctiveness of Nicholas Cage in the voice of Grug. The animators do a competent job and the 3D effects are half decent in some sequences which makes the film intermittently bearable.Built into this film is the somewhat tenuous message that not listening to parents can be rewarding and that parents tend to be somewhat behind the curve.While a sense of adventure and inventiveness is a invaluable lesson children need to learn, this film delivers it in a way that very young children can easily misconstrue.Ultimately from the perspective of a 5 year olds father, kids can watch Tom and Jerry at home on Cartoon Network and the economics of visiting the multiplex for The Croods just does not work out, if you build in the cost of the popcorn and soda and over three hours of time. I walked out feeling suckered by the marketing wizards behind The Croods. The characters here are sometimes cute but the film itself is mostly crude. Be selfish, let your kids sit this one out.Published on my blog mostlycinema.com",5,17,46,19 March 2013
Warm Bodies," Subverting the genre ?Not quite..
","Its summertime in America, OK not really, since large swathes of the country are still blanketed under snow, but for Hollywood its about blockbuster time.Its that time of the year when America must suffer another apocalypse, which of course means there must be a CGI-ed post apocalyptic America to gawk at, which gives the studios a raison d'être by offering us yet another spin on how America may bounce back again from the dead.The makers of this film take this notion very seriously indeed and they give us a Zombie romance where the undead become the unloved, as a tiny zombie shuffle towards redemption.I saw a Twilight film once, (yes yes, I know), and to be honest, thought it was a perfectly entertaining film. And I totally understood the hysteria surrounding Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart.While watching Warm Bodies I was completely fooled into believing I was watching Ms Stewart when it fact it was Ms Teresa Palmer, her clone.Now thats a cheap trick but then who cares.Warm Bodies is another riff on the Zombie genre and tries to be cash in on the current craze for paranormal romance, just the way Beautiful Creatures recently did.I walked out of that affront of a film but this one was a little more tolerable.We start at square one, there has been a deadly epidemic and most Americans have turned Zombies, but this time there is a class divide, some are badder, the 'bonies',erstwhile zombies, who against their better(ahem..) judgement have peeled away their unnecessary layers of skin and flesh to become lean mean killing machines.Now if you were a zombie, shuffling along slowly, seems a terrible handicap when hunting fitter humans for food, but zombies cant think, can they? Except to sniff out human flesh, and lunge for it? We will let this pass since this is a zombie film, remember? We see a zombie in a red hoodie who can't recall much about himself except the first alphabet of his name, R (Robert Pattinson maybe?). He has delusions of grandeur, he feels he has a heart and is capable of human emotions like befriending a fellow zombie.In this mix arrives Julie( lookalike alert!) and R eats her boyfriends brains, ingests his memories in the process, which will help him hook Julie.Julies father is Grigio (John Malkowitch) who is the leader of the last surviving group of humans, armed to the hilt , he has the whole arsenal of NRAs(whose members must have turned zombie too) legacy at his disposal, so he cant complain, and is determined to blow every zombie brain off, that he can find.That will undoubtedly pose serious problems for Julie and R when they do fall in love.What Malkotcih is doing in this film beats me, making pocket money maybe, but undoubtedly his presence is likely to sell quite a few tickets but loose him a few fans in the process.The makeup guys get the transition of the zombies to human just right, and so do the actors. Nicholas Hoult nearly pulls of a badly written role with his disciplined performance, the same cannot be said of Mr Malkowitch and Ms Palmer.Jonathan Levine has made a mixed bag of films which showcase his ambition but unfortunately he seems more preoccupied with become a saleable director than a good one. Warm Bodies tries to subvert the genre of zombie movies but in the process produces a film bereft of the charm required of a rom-com. The scenes between R and Julie have no chemistry and the sequences which set up their romance just do not add up to the imagination bending premise of a hot babe falling for a zombie who just killed her boyfriend. The scene where Julie reunites with her father is so devoid of emotion that it should alert us the director does not have his heart in the right place, unlike the zombies whose hearts are beginning to beat again.Jonathan Levine, the director is certainly not dead, just hope he gets warmer.",6,0,2,19 March 2013
