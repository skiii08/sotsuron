Casablanca," This is the top- absolutely number 1
","I just watched Casablanca again for the umpteenth time. My intention was just to watch a little of the beginning, but although I've seen it many times, it was impossible to turn it off. The film just pulled me along with an irresistible force, so superbly is it crafted.This is, in a nutshell, the greatest American film ever made, Citizen Kane not withstanding. As great as the cinematography and editing is in Citizen Kane, the writing and acting in this film is of another order of magnitude. There is one unforgettable performance after another- Bogart, Bergman, Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Conrad Veidt, Dooley Wilson, S.Z. Sakall. What a list!This film doesn't have a wasted frame or ever hit a bad note. Its like a perfect piece of music. This is one movie that lives up to its hype- and exceeds it. The best, most romantic and intriguing American movie ever? In a word, yes.",10,1,3,1 February 2006
Chariots of Fire," A masterpiece
","I am going to come right out and say that I love this film- it is so important to me, that its one of those rare few films that don't want to see too often, so I can preserve some of the original wonder that I felt when I first saw it. It nourishes me as an artist and a human being.This film is what I think great cinema can be. It has terrific acting, a beautiful simple story, wonderful production values, and of course that score- certainly one of the most beautiful and haunting scores in the history of film.What it has that is most important, however, is heart. This movie has a wonderful message about what it means to be human, to be alive. What better metaphor for the sheer passion of living than the exhilaration of simply running as fast as you can.This movie is as close to pure perfection as any movie made in the last twenty-five years. As one woman wrote, watch it with your children. Mine loved it, and it became my son's favorite film as he reached adulthood.",10,10,13,21 October 2005
The Simpsons Movie," Classic Simpsons
","I went to see this in the afternoon on a whim, and the small audience was chuckling or laughing out loud just about the whole time. This is basically a very good, long and without commercial interruption, episode. It places particular emphasis on the Simpson family itself and their now familiar individual personalities and quirks, The movie takes advantage of the wide screen format, without going overboard. The intimate quality of the television series is preserved. Basically the Simpsons are huge TV stars who have made the jump to the movies without forgetting where they came from- to pull out a hackneyed clich√© worthy of the show itself.Classic Simpson gags, with a dose of 'not suitable for prime-time' nudity and lewdness. Best bit: Bart on a skateboard- what you don't see and then.... well enough, go see the movie. Even the Fox logo in the opening has the classic Simpson touch.There are a few treats and a surprise for those who have the patience to sit through the endless credits.Simpson fans will not be disappointed.",8,1,4,28 July 2007
