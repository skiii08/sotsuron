The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Boring, don't waste your money.
","This movie was nothing like the first two. The story really never led anywhere. There were a few scenes that were very well executed that I really liked, but for the most part I found myself bored and checking the time constantly. It was a very obvious attempt of splitting one story into 2 movies to increase profits. This movie has no real plot, no climax, not even a good cliffhanger. Many scenes were so drawn out it was an obvious attempt to just increase screen time to make a full movie. I have to say I found Jennifer Lawrence's acting to be particularly terrible and emotionless in this film. Skip the theater on this one, just wait for part 2 to come out and watch them together, or just watch the first 5 minutes of part 1 and then fast forward to the end because nothing happens in the middle anyways.",3,28,41,22 November 2014
Gone Girl," Entertaining but several plot-holes left me feeling disappointed
","Overall I found the movie to be pretty entertaining and enjoyed the plot twists along the way. Overall entertainment value would probably be an 8 or 9 out of 10. However, the movie has so many inconceivable discrepancies that I can't really call it a great movie. I found myself wanting to yell at the screen several times. Additionally, the actress did an okay job of playing the evil version of Amy but did a terrible job of portraying the normal Amy in the intro. You never once believed her and Nick were actually in love. **Contains Spoilers**Major Flaws: 1. The hicks that robbed her were smart enough to notice she had a patchy dye job, etc so she must be in hiding but even though they were watching the news about Amy's disappearance they were unable to recognize her? 2. The secret service agents never followed or checked up on NPH's character even though she had a restraining order against him? 3. Why would Nick go to his father's house to destroy her journal and then not even make sure it actually burned? Why not just destroy the 1 incriminating page. This part of the story becomes even worse when Amy returns and the police believe her story of being kidnapped. Why would NPH take her journal to Nick's dad's house to be burned? Especially when we are to believe he attempted to burn the 'murder' weapon at Nick and Amy's house. 4. Who did she buy the car from on Craigslist/where did she store it? Seems like this person may have remembered her purchasing the car when they see her picture on TV. 5. Why doesn't Nick pursue Amy being charged with murder? Certainly the fact that she framed another man for rape in the same fashion could have come into play here. 6. Why don't the police bother viewing the footage from the lake-house? Certainly they could retrieve the footage of her frolicking around on the patio for days prior to the one scene where she throws herself against the glass pretending to be held captive. Additionally, after that scene doesn't she just pick herself up and walk away? When she 'escapes,' why didn't she call the police from there, why would she drive all the way home covered in blood? Why doesn't she have any sign of injuries from the supposed incident of massive blood loss in her kitchen? 7. How did she retrieve Nick's sperm and get artificially inseminated as soon as she returned home? She would not have even had time to discover she was pregnant.It was just completely unbelievable that Nick would choose to stay with her after this, he would be completely terrified of her and would not be able to live that way. The ending was just horrible!",6,2,10,13 October 2014
