The Ring," 12 years and I still get scared!
","I dare you to watch this movie and not be afraid of your own TV a week forward. Or at least look at it with caution. As if it would betray you. As if you are afraid to happen to see something you shouldn't have seen.It doesn't matter how many times i see this movie, the atmosphere of it gives me the chills every time. The performance is flawless from everyone involved. It does not rely on cheap jump scares or shaky cam or the recent find footage trick. The find footage in the movie is actual find footage and is important to the story. Many horror-movies tried to copy its formula for the years to come. Iwould say that even paranormal activity was inspired by it. All fails to comparison to the ring. Only one that came close was the grudge.I've never seen the original Japanese version, but I never felt the need to do so after watching the remake, simply because I was satisfied and scared at the same time. A movie 12 years old that still captures you in the moment and gives you the chills. Thats an achievement!",10,2,2,31 August 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Don't watch it if you're not a real Star Trek fan, on second thought ?
","Saw it in 3D with a real Star trek fan. I hated this movie, he loved it. I was surprise coming home and see so many trekkers disappointed too.I was never in too Star Trek, Inm y opinion the whole universe is so stupid and so pointless, over the top and exhausting. So I was really surprised how Star Trek (2009) took me by storm. It really came with something different and new, as well as honoring the old stuff. I was happy to see such cool effects again on the big screen, with a great story and characters very believable.Sadly, Star Trek: into darkness had none of that! It was the plain old bull from the old star trek with different faces. 10 minutes into the movie and I was getting bored and thought I was watching pirates of the Caribbean in space, regretting spending my money.The plot is overdone, too complicated to follow. The shots gave me a headache, especially in 3D, and character development leading nowhere.I cant say the acting was bad though, however the lines were poorly written. The cast did a really good job with the work given to them. Simon Pegg was great. His character got some great development, sadly we see too little of him. John Cho was also great, sadly he suffers the same faith as Simon Pegg.But acting cant save an entire film. The cast are literally loyal to the sinking ship.If you enjoyed the first movie, and otherwise don't care about Star Trek, Don't WATCH THIS!",5,10,24,13 May 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," This is on par with The dark knight
","Every now and then you get so much up into a movie you need to see it again on the big screen. I was dumb enough to go see the 2D version in a smaller cinema. There was some scenes clearly made for 3D animation and it didn't turn out that good in 2D. However, the movie in itself sucked me in enough to ignore that, and I could enjoy it without relying on cheap (figuretively) effects.Last time I felt to revisit a movie so strongly on the big screen again was with The dark knight. It is that good. Of course being an x-men fan helps, but you can walk into this movie without knowing anything about the franchise and still enjoy it. I say this is a sequel to x- men first class. Bringing in wolverine is self explained in the movie.This movie is a solid, great performance, great time, 9/10. Why not 10/10 giving it excellent? IT is excellent as a whole. But comparing Old Xavier to new Xavier, Old magneto to new magneto..they got outplayed by the younger generation. But that is really nitpicking. Since I saw x-men first class, which really defined the 2 leaders, Its hard to adjust back to the old actors.",9,1,3,21 June 2014
No Country for Old Men," I don't get it!
","I have to say, for all the hype this movie have I had to see it. I never liked the Cohen brothers movies. So this is no exception. I think its bad. Boring, not intriguing and forgettable characters. The only not forgettable character is the psychopath with he weird hair. And he doesn't convince me as the bad guy. YES, I don't think he does a convincing job! They call it western. I've seen a lot better westerns, even modern time westerns. Is it disturbing? Not really. Cohen brothers always try to take a dark turn into the humanity of peoples choices. I will never get it,nor will I see the brilliance of there movies. I don't believe that human nature is that black and white in the core, with lots of shade of Gray in the everyday mans choices. It feels so simplified.I like to compare the villain in NCFOM with the villains in the dark knight. Now, heath ledgers joker was a masterpiece! Even though it was never explained why or how he became the joker, he was believable and you believed the oriented chaos within him. In that aspect, the Mexican fails. It tries to be explained bit about the mental instability from the Mexican in the movie, but its so vague you never get invested to try understand him. In that sense I compare the Mexican to two face/Harvey Dent. Both have the 'create own luck' by flipping a coin. However, Harvey Dent was explained and we invested a lot of time into knowing him. Try to imagine Two face without build up. You might end up with tommy lee Jones bad joker make over from batman forever. And this is my main problem with the Mexican. Although not a joker impression, he is thrown in to the movie, no sense behind it. And what we see is just an empty shell acting from a manuscript.So would i recommend this movie? I have my thoughts about it. However, if you like the Cohen brothers then I would say watch it. If you don't, its not worth your time.",4,1,4,27 September 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Imagine this without knowing what star wars is.
","What makes a movie good? The passion behind it. I am a huge angry video game nerd fan. However, I can acknowledge he made a bad movie. I think he can see that himself. However I could see the effort behind it. I could enjoy it for what it was. The same goes with Ed Wood. A terrible terrible director with possible the worst movie of all times. Still, it is worth seeing just to see the passion going down such a bad movie.Now with passion directed the right way, the movie can be amazing. If you never seen Star wars before, you will see the effort put in to this movie. You will be curious to why it is so much passion behind it, where they got all the ideas from, how it all started. And you will find TONS and TONS of material to read and listen through. Sadly if you know what Star wars is about, you know that the previous passionate soul that was behind the franchise became a sellout. He wanted to sell toys and make more money. He wanted to put his name in every aspect of the franchise to make money. He wanted to use CGI to save effort, instead of using CGI to enhance the movie experience.That is why the franchise needed a fresh start. A new hope, going in a different direction. The negative aspect many people have is that it is too similar to the original without new ideas. I disagree. I see a lot of old content mixed with new stuff. I believe that JJ Abrams wanted to do with star wars what he previously done to Star Trek. Opening it to a new audience. Replacing bad stuff with new stuff. He sets his own tune yet honoring the past. Some say he played it too 'safe' not taking risk. However, I see the risks he took, and it did work out well. There is no 'safe' when it comes to taking over a franchise and bringing new life to it. There is no safety when you trying to persuade viewers that previously though Star Wars is about toys and kids, in reality has depth to it.I loved this movie for all the right reasons. If I didn't know what Star Wars was, I would now be curious to see all of it. It had passion, effort, great scenery, a story leading forward, a mystery and chilling atmosphere. It had great characters, great dialogue, great action. This movie had it all.Why not 10/10 then you might wonder. I was talking to a friend before I went to the cinema asking him if he like to go with me and see it. He said 'i don 't want to go see a bunch of robots in space'. I replied 'they removed all of that nonsense'. Sadly, (and i wont reveal to much here) some of that nonsense remained simply for fan service, which really took away that perfect score for me. Finally I like to say, this movie has a heart of solid force! pun intended.",10,3,16,20 December 2015
Looper," Really, 8.2? For what?
","I am trying to be fair and not give it more or less then this movie deserves. 4 of 10 is fair. This movie should be released straight to DVD. Too many plot holes, weird explanations and the sci-fi technology looks to belong in the 80's.The loop in my head is stuck on many of the plot holes and how people rate this so high. It is perhaps because it was a long time since a movie like this was released, and its nice to see something refreshing. But it doesn't do it for me. If I could time-travel, I would tell myself this movie isn't worth the money, thus saving myself 2 hours of time.Of course this leaves me in the paradox, because not seeing the movie i wouldn't know if it suck or not, therefore I couldn't go back in time with that knowledge. And this paradox I made up makes more sense then the paradoxes and plot holes in the movie.",4,10,27,8 October 2012
