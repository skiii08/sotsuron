Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Another GREAT episode of the Star Wars saga
","I really like this movie. I got a little upset about criticisms done to this film.I didn't like Jar Jar as other characters, but in my opinion, this character is not a big deal or problem in this movie. Also about the acting, I think that if the acting's good,then excellent, but if not it is not a really bad problem. The only thing that I didn't like was the short role of Darth Maul, but that doesn't stop him from being one of the most popular characters in episode I, and possibly the whole saga, not to mention he's in a fight better than those in the original trilogy. Ian McDiarmid is great as Darth Sidious and he shows a with great acting the most evil villain in the Star Wars universe.George Lucas is one of my favorite directors because he created the saga and has done ANH, TPM, AOTC, and ROTS with great effects and good story.The story is very good, it was already the time for a body as the trade federation to become involved in a villain plot. It's good to see one of the greateast villains in movie history as a kid for one episode.The music adds drama to the battles and the movie would not be the same without it.When I found the movie received a Razzie nominations, I got shocked and I don't think the film should have received those nominations. I really love this movie and about the flaws that other fans hate, for me they're minor flaws and shouldn't stop people from loving this movie.",9,7,10,5 April 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Another great star wars film, thanks george
","I remember when i was 11 and watched this film in theaters. I loved it and i still do now tat i'm 17. I loved the romance between anakin and padme (even more than the one between leia and han in episodes 5 and 6), it was touching. I love the anakin character since he is an easy one to relate to. Some people think hayden did a bad job but i kinda disagree (i remember him giving me the creeps in the tusken raider slaughter scene back in the theater. the story was great and i absolutely loved the ending (the wedding and the start of the clone wars).i don't agree with anyone that says that the people suck and i never will. i think the prequels are well done and give the saga more drama, more depth and make it more epic. if you hate this film or any of the other star wars films (even episode 1) then there's no talking to you.thanks george for the amazing gift of sixamazing star wars films (clone wars is not much of a movie to me) and also four adventurous indiana jones movies.",9,1,2,18 February 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," the best in the star wars saga
","After seeing this film twice in the theaters, I became a Star Wars fan. George Lucas made an excellent work in this film with the story and the special effects. Also, John Williams's musical score is fantastic and dramatic. The acting is great. Hayden Christensen makes a powerful performance as the young adult who will become Darth Vader. The scene in which Anakin has evil yellow eyes is a powerful scene. Ian McDiarmid is great as the the most evil guy in the saga.But the real good thing is the story. This film shows us that Vader is a more complex 'villain' than we thought of. He was doing evil when he thought he was doing the right thing. We also see Luke and Leia as babies how and why were they were separated at the beginning of episode IV. We also know how the republic becomes the evil empire came to be and how the Jedi order became almost extinct Fans will be pleased with the short cameo role of Jar-Jar, who only appears in three scenes with no major role. But my favorite par of this film is when Anakin is encased in the black suit which creates the greatest villain ever featured on screen. Also, the duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan is very well done and is possibly the most climatic and powerful in the six-part saga. This movie made me enjoy all the other five films a lot more than before and now I see them as one big and amazing 12-hour film. Thank you, Mr. Lucas.",10,1,4,9 September 2006
