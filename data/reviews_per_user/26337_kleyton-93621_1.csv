It," Brilliant movie excellent performances by children and Bill
","Best King horror adaption yet...I like the new Pennywise it's so creepy ,Tim Curry nailed it but it was just a crazy clown. In this adaption played by Bill Skarsg√•rd Pennywise is the real deal a demon a monster. Kids are perfect loved them all. CGI could be better though. I can't wait for part 2 and i hope it will be darker and more frightening.",9,2,4,10 October 2017
