Lucky Number Slevin," great flick
","Wow. What a great flick. I had read some reviews of this and was intrigued by the cast.Started out a bit slow, but Hartnett did a great job and frankly any movie with Morgan Freeman in it can't be all bad.To me this was a cross between Pulp Fiction, Snatch and Reservoir Dogs. Bruce Willis was superb as usual, playing a very subdued character. Reminded me a lot of his character in The Sixth Sense. In fact, I think they used the same wardrobe and hairdresser.Very cool noir sorta flick. Confusing to be sure, but rest assured it all ties together nicely with multiple twists and turns. Sure, some of them are expected, but some catch you going 'oooohhhhh'.Mykelti Williamson has a nice little role.I give this movie an 8 out of 10. Hartnett was superb and I almost forgive him for Pearl Harbor.",8,2,9,17 April 2006
