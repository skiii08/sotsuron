Changeling," Impeccable...Flawless!!
",Yes! Clint Eastwood did it again with another classic -CHANGELING! Changeling is a perfect balance between reality and emotions brought out in a splendid manner.The motherly desire and love for her only child is portrayed beautifully. Angelina Jolie has done a great job as Christine Collins as she stands against all odds and continues her search for her lost son. The movie gives us the message that sometimes one ray of hope is enough to live our entire life. The movie leaves us with a lump in the throat and a positivity. It reminds us of The Shawshank redemption with its hopefulness. It is definitely a must watch and if you are missing it then you are missing out on something.,9,3,4,8 April 2009
