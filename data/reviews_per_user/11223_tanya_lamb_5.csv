The Ring," The way horror movies are supposed to be
","This film was excellent.  It succeeded in being scary without being bloody or stupid and had a wonderfully complex plot and narrative that was interesting, intriguing and threw you off when you least suspected it.  The 'not knowing' and fear factors poked at all of our fears of the unknown. One of the most wonderful things about this film was the title.  When you watch this complex movie, you'll see that the title is an interesting image/concept and completes the reason for the film.  I am a horror film buff and I give this 8/10.",8,0,0,10 February 2003
The English Patient," The most authentic love story ever told...
","When I first walked out of the theatre I was dazed, love stuck and full of awe for at least 24 hours.  The content of the film, the cinematography and the impeccable acting won me over immediately.  The movie touches on so many things we endure through the human experience: love, betrayal, war, death, separation, memory and finally, loyalty. After watching it many times I am still impressed with the incredible story this movie so brilliantly tells.",9,1,4,16 January 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Couldn't pull it together
","Although this movie had all the right elements: a great cast and a potentially great plot, it was a giant flop.  No build up, no screen chemistry.  I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat when I invariably could have been!",6,0,1,14 December 2001
Wimbledon," Nothing special, and certainly not much more than the preview
","Kirsten is cute, but its predictable and not all that exciting. The fact that it was in England was one of the only things that I liked about it. I love a good accent! Even the tennis stuff is okay, but it just didn't give away anything new, it was just a really long drawn out something that was less than convincing. Cutesy only gets you so far, you know? Could it be that the reason is that I am not a tennis fan? I don't think so. Just a lack of urgency. or something. If you have seen the preview, you have pretty much seen the movie. I was disappointed but I'll get over it. Sometimes a movie is just a fill in the spaces sort of thing for a Friday night.",4,0,1,20 September 2004
Atonement," Atrocious waste of my time
","With all of the Ocsar buzz, and a cover that looked like other epic classics such as the English Patient, I decided to rent this movie. I really wish that I hadn't as it was the worst movie I have seen in many years.Character and plot development are awful and you are not given enough of the main characters' relationships to believe the totality of the story. The movie also jumps around and is very, very confusing. The scenes that were chosen for the film do nothing for the movie, resulting in an unfocused piece of cinema.Way too much time is spent on pointless war scenes and the story is entirely clich√©d.I wouldn't watch this again if someone paid me.",2,4,9,29 March 2008
