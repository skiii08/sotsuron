Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If you're a Star Wars geek you'll love it, if not you'll find it crap, it's as simple as that!
","If you're a Star Wars fanatic, you'll love this movie. If you're just a regular movie enthusiast, you'll find the story line very weak and even really ridiculous at times (definitely not in a good way). It wasn't worth waiting in line an hour and a half but it's worth seeing at least once just because of the name 'Star Wars'.",5,0,1,22 May 1999
