Resident Evil: Afterlife," Afterlife keeps it up
","Well, I'm a very fan of game series, though I haven't finished any, excluding RE 3: Nemesis, by myself. I admit, that I just enjoyed to watch my friends playing RE. When first part of movie appeared, I was really amazed. It just did everything, that I needed. Second was not even a step behind and so was third. I wondered, when will they screw up (experienced by e.g. Alien, which fourth part was just silly). When I saw on IMDb, that Afterlife is going to release, I just waited for the date. I didn't see a trailer (I hate trailers). What I say about fourth RE is in the subject of this review. It's just awesome! Milla is outstanding and I even enjoy miss Larter, who lately is becoming a very talented actress for me. And it's Claire Redfield's fight against huge boss in the shower room, which amazed me most. This scene is 10 on 10 for me. So why no 10? One minus is similarity of Wesker to agents in matrix (I noticed it too). The second is for water-adapted zombies (exagerrated). Fight against Wesker is a little weak for me too. At first, he's much faster, than Alice, and later, somehow, he's too slow. And if we compare to the fight with this boss, I mentioned, then this fight is just weak. But whole movie is great. I can't wait for fifth part. Hope it will still be in the line with others. Oh, and about 3d. It was fine, but I was hoping, it will be in the IMAX technology. Simple 3d was a little disturbance for me. When I saw, that IMAX is not available, I was trying to watch film in simple 2d, but it wasn't available, either :D So I watched 3d. 3d effects are just so-so.",9,4,10,23 October 2010
The Expendables," I liked it, but it could be better
","The movie was great. All of 'em are my idols and none is, that i'd dislike. Comparing to some other reviews - Schwarzenegger could have more to do. But I suppose, that he wanted too much cash, and it stopped at one scene role. I didn't know, that Seagal and Van Damme was proposed to cast in the movie, but it's a pity, that they refused. I'd like to watch it with 'em too. Spoiler ! - A pity is for the Jet Li, but not for the poor dialog, as one reviewed, but for the director to let him loose with Lundgren. Jet Li should've won :D What I like about this movie, that it's not focused on one or two characters, but it says something about every one of them. What I like most are fighting scenes. I don't care if they were sped up, or something. They're just awesome. Specially Statham on Basketball court (my favorite scene and actor) ! :D Eight out of ten, because though I liked it very much, I was hoping even better, but it's just great.",8,2,5,24 October 2010
Joker," Great story. Poor acting. Missing plots to merchandise.
","I watched the movie with pleasure. Somehow mr Phoenix doesn't fit for this character. He was just unnatural. Also in batman movies no one knows, who the joker is, yet here he showes himself at the TV show and kills the host live. How come no one knows him later?",7,0,6,2 January 2020
The Wrestler," There are no movies like this much nowadays
",I saw it years ago. Just made a rewatch. Awesome movie with the greatest actors performance. A have-to-watch for anyone,10,0,0,10 April 2020
Casino Royale," Best Bond, I've seen
","One of the best movies, I've ever seen (not only Bond series).Strange for me is the time-line of the series. How come, that Bond gets 00 only now? But then I thought up, that You can't take Bond series as one big story, but every movie separately. However - next Bond is a follow up of Casino Royale.Well - I have CR on blu-ray on my own, and I will see it many many times more, than I saw. As a matter of fact - I will see it no less, than once in two - three months.I recommend it to every Bond fan and every other human, that wants to see a good movie.",10,1,4,4 May 2013
