Raiders of the Lost Ark," Classic action movie, and one of the best of all time
","This movie, it's got well timed humor, engaging action scenes, likable main characters, thorough character development, and a plot that's actually interesting. This excellent film will forever be in my heart. It's got everything every action movie should have that many of this particular genre in today's time are missing, character development, relationships (whether friendship,family, or romance), witty jokes that are pulled out at the time, suspense, human weaknesses, and guts. Hollywood needs to learn from the classics (and I don't mean we should re make the stinking film, which has become a trend in the industry lately, i suppose for some fast bucks)",10,2,2,23 April 2017
Passengers," Amazing
","Loved the original plot line, the chemistry between the characters, the jokes, the action, everything. Lawrence and Pratt did simply a marvelous job at portraying the characters as well. The people working in Rotten Tomatoes must've had sticks up their butt holes when watching this, hence the bad rating.",10,0,1,23 April 2017
Knives Out," One of the best mystery movies I've seen in a while
","The plot was well thought out and had many unexpected twists, the characters were interesting and all fun to watch, and the actors were amazing. I loved the aesthetic of the movie as well, especially the mansion in this movie.",10,2,2,6 July 2020
Frozen," Super overrated
","Until Zootopia had finally come into the picture, everyone questionably not only went head over heels for this film, but would not get over it after TWO whole years. At the beginning of 2015, it felt as though the the film had just come out, even though it was released 2 years prior to that, because it was still fresh in everyone's minds due to all of the ridiculous praising on the internet. The first time that I watched it, I actually didn't hate it. My favorite character was Kristof personally, for he seemed like a genuine and sweet dude. Olaf was alright, however after a while his presence was starting to get really annoying due to his ignorance and stupidity. Everyone else in the movie seemed to lack common sense. Ana is whiny and spoiled (even for princess standards) and is oblivious towards everything. I get her vulnerability due to, I guess, basically being alone for all these years, but come on, wanting to marry a guy you've just met? Yes, it's clearly pointing the obvious fact that something is fishy with this Hans guy suddenly showing up in her life, singing about finishing each other's sandwiches, and proposing to her. A prince, who is desperate to marry into the throne, psh..no way. Then once she finds out that Hans is actually evil, she then suddenly realizes that, 'Oh wow, I guess Kristof loves me lol duh' after having a chat with a stupid snowman standing next to a fire. Because in Disney movies, if a guy is trying to keep you from getting killed, you must have some sort of romantic connection with him, and it obviously means that it's because he thinks that you're cute. She's got a nice singing voice though, so thanks Kristen Bell. Elsa is even worse. Elsa's musical number sucks, she treats her sister like crap instead of conversing with her and explaining her issues so that at least Ana could understand (yes the took Ana's memory of Elsa's powers away, for some stupid reason, I don't think that was any bit necessary for that to happen in order for her to unfreeze her head or whatever. Even if it did make sense at that time, when Ana had finally found out about her powers, she didn't suddenly disappear or anything stupid like that, meaning that Elsa and her idiotic parents could've told her what was going on with her sister a long time ago. But whatever. And then the worst part, the end, when she finally discovers how to control her powers, 'Love. Haha the answer is love' LOVE GUYS. Because love conquers all guys! And she had only realized this, all of the sudden, after all of the disaster that she had caused, that she could've learned to control her powers of she had used freaking 'Love' whatever the hell THAT means. The trolls also suck",4,5,11,6 July 2017
Sausage Party," Terribly nauseating film, and not just from the gross-out humor
","Even for a movie called 'sausage party,' it is incredibly nasty. I knew, with no doubt, that this would be, even for a rated-R film, a risqu√© showing, for obvious reasons, but my god...this is our comedy today? Seth Rogan did okay in 'The Interview' and from what I know, that's about it. I do not know where to start, it's just wrong in every single way, the moral (and the way they taught it), the sex scene in the end, the rape scene with the douche and juice box, the lack of logic in the plot, the abundance of (extremely) boring and repetitive sex jokes, most of these jokes in general, the random weed smoking scene, the highly extreme liberal bias (I'm a liberal myself, and I do not appreciate Rogan giving us such a bad rep with this propaganda, nor the one-sided 'lesson' that 'religion sucks, lets just f*** each other' with this terrible comparison with this plot and actual religion, nor do I like you over-generalizing religious people as all being these brainwashed and ignorant bigots, who you just so happen to not agree with.)I love offensive humor (guilty pleasure lol), I believe that non-pc humor can be fun to watch or listen to, for there are ways of taking a very sensitive topic and bring the humor out of it, however, in most cases, this movie doesn't do that. There were a few clever jokes I liked ('exterminate the juice' '72 extra virgin olive oil (quoted from the lavash, who of course represents the Muslim/Arab community, I just hope the people who had written that joke is aware that the '72 virgins in paradise is an Islamic belief' myth isn't even mentioned in the Qur'an anywhere. I'd like to hope that they were just making fun of a common stereotype/misconception of Muslims and their belief, but from the movie's message exclaiming that, 'religions are bullcrap' I feel as though these gullible and misinformed writer actually legitimately thought that this is actually a thing that they believe in. Idiots. At least it was funny though, would be more clever if it actually true.)' 'baby carrots' 'bath salts exposing the fact that the food can talk' and a few others I can't think of) But the rest is predictable, unoriginal, and immature. So instead of laughing, it only pisses you off. Just because a comedy is edgy doesn't mean it's good.",3,1,3,15 July 2017
Arrival," One of the best movies of 2016
","I cannot get over how fantastic this wonderfully intelligent masterpiece was, in fact, this may be my new favorite movie. The emotion, the plot, the intellectual dialogue, the plot twist, the aesthetics, the acting, the moral, everything about this movie was just perfect in my opinion.The pathos are strong in this movie, ten minutes into the movie, my eyes were already tearing up. I also loved the original plot line, it's not you're typical 'aliens invade the planet and we all try to exterminate them while they try to exterminate us' bull crap. Do not even get me started with the complete twist to the story, it's honestly a bit mindblowing. Anyways, please watch the movie, you surely will not regret it.",10,2,6,23 April 2017
