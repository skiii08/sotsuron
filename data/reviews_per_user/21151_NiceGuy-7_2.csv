The Ring," Terrible
","Just how my feelings for governor-elect Rod Blagoevich can be summed up with the first third of his name (Bla) so can this movie.  It was poorly written and made little sense.  On top of the movie being too long and drawn out, the scarriest part of the movie was when my cellular phone started going off in my zipper pocket and I could not get it open.  It left the audience with too many questions and not nearly enough answers.  I would watch my wording so that I didn't ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it yet, but I hope that no other people waste their $5.75+ to go see this.",Null,0,0,17 November 2002
Ghostbusters," Another Classic Out of The 80's ERA!!!
","This might be one of the greatest movies of all time.  For the mid-80's the special effects were done quite well and I commend the makers for it. My personal favorite line in the movie is when Bill Murray says 'I make it a rule to never sleep with possesed clients, (and Sigorney Weaver kisses him), it's more of a guide-line than a rule.'  This movie should be seen more than once, I have seen it coutless times, and i own it.  Another classic out of the 80's!",10,1,1,5 September 1999
