The Blair Witch Project," Scariest Movie Ever Made? NOT!
","The 'buzz' for this movie was like nothing I'd ever seen, and I guess it was inevitable that it would fail to live up to the hype.  Don't get me wrong -- this was a really, really good movie -- GREAT premise and fabulous performances.  But it just wasn't scary!  My friends and I discussed it at length and decided the best word was 'creepy.'  If we hadn't been exposed to all the buildup and spoilers, we would have been very impressed, indeed. But given all the the hype, we couldn't help being a bit disappointed.  (And what's with that ending, anyway?)",8,1,2,19 July 1999
