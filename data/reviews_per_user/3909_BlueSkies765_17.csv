The Devil's Advocate," Best of the best
","What a way to tell a classic tale of evil. Kevin Lomax (what a name right?) is a brilliant lawyer who gets an offer to work in New York. Here he gets seduced by power and prestige.The movie is very captivating. Tall larger than life buildings where multiple times you have characters standing at the highest level of the building. This serves as a metaphor for the devil being on top of the world, the movie got a lot of these references. Also the special effects are creepy but it's subtle, feels very unique and stands out in the movie. But the story also lures you in. A small step at a time Kevin gets more invested in his less admirable vices and makes the wrong choices. If it's not the prestige from being a success in stunning New York, there's always the lust that consumes Kevin. As Milton says he sets the stage, but Kevin makes the choices. I've watched this some time ago but when you watch it again you see how subtle he gets lured in.
The devil was working on Kevin from the beginning. To add insult to injury it was also Milton who while being there to corrupt Kevin is also the one advising him to not make certain choices.
I loved the pacing of this movie. Kevin slowly being hypnotized throughout the movie with a great third act (this is where movies usually fail). And there's great performances from so many people.",10,1,1,23 June 2020
The Mask," Jim Carrey IS The Mask
",The Mask was made for Jim Carrey. Even though he had some good work before this movie I think he really got popular during the Mask/Ace Ventura era. His cartoonish and expressive style of comedy really stood out. The movie is based on a cartoon and really feels like one too. Anything goes. We're also introduced to other stars like Cameron Diaz. I remember when they would promote this movie they milked the heck out of that shot where she walks into the bank. I would see it everywhere. I think she played the role well as the girlfriend of the bad guy who still feels like a real meanie to this day. It sometimes feels a bit out of place. The very realistic feeling and harsh bad guy in a somewhat cartoonish Universe but I guess the point was to show Stanley is the exact opposite. Peter Greene played the bad guy well.What I really didn't notice when I first watched but now is that the dog Milo was pretty talented. They had him doing all kinds of trick that he did with ease with the right expressions. It was the movie The Mask that made me want to have a dog.One of Jim Carrey's best movies.,10,0,0,2 June 2020
It," A classic
","The long awaited remake delivered. It 1990 was one of the first scary movies I've seen. It still remains one of my all time favorite horror movies.In this version the scary scenes are more fierce and in your face. You even see kids get hurt, something unheard of back in the day. The fate of the kids was left to your imagination.
Also I love It 1990 because nostalgia plays a huge part. When you're new to watching movies it has more of an impact than when you've seen similar stories. So I can see how younger viewers like this version over the 1990 one.With that being said the heart of the movie is the same. It's about overcoming your fear and about friendship. With Pennywise as the bogeyman he still has a menacing presence.The fear aspect was done brilliantly. It captured an atmosphere of terror where characters felt powerless but at the same time had a sense of urgency of figuring out a way to defeat Pennywise, because they knew they had to deal with it. The buildup from powerless to empowered was nicely directed.This movie also had some scary scenes that are better than It 1990. In some ways I found Pennywise more menacing and some scenarios were downright frightening. You can tell the director really wanted to give this movie its own identity.And the most important part is that the bond of the Losers Club feels genuine and you can relate to when you where a kid spending your summer with friends dealing with a new, scary topic as a kid that you don't have the answers to. A real story with a life lesson is told.Overall I really loved it. Both versions are great in their own way.",10,0,2,5 May 2019
Captain Marvel," Marvelous
","As someone who hasn't read Marvel Comics or watched most of their movies, this was a new experience and I loved it!Captain Marvel is a futuristic stylish movie filled with action. A movie that is around 2 hours long yet I wanted to see more when the credits rolled. Something that rarely happens to me when I watch movies.I love the story! The lead characters arch was interesting. It felt normal like any person would experience in her position. Her growth from someone struggling to find a place in the universe to superhero was well written and directed. The technologies seemed well thought out and plausible. The way they also gave pieces of the backstory is one of the strengths of the movie. It's never too long and the director knew when to switch scenes to not make you lose interest. Also it wasn't overly dramatic. A pet peeve of mine in movies.What also worked in her journey is that the other characters were equally interesting. Enough depth was given to most of the characters and this made you like multiple characters and the different type of interactions kept me engaged the entire movie.I also liked the changes throughout the story that I didn't expect. I think that what kept me guessing also is that I didn't watch the trailer or read the source material. So while at first it looked like the story was going to take place in a futuristic other planet it quickly changed to earth in the 90s. The differences between planets and the characters comments about them was funny.The CGI is top notch. I've been disappointed with remarkably bad CGI from big budget movies the last couple of years but in Captain Marvel I didn't see any of that. Luckily, because it somewhat pulls you out of the movie and it makes the movie feel cheap.I really love this movie and can't wait for part 2!",10,2,9,28 May 2019
The Irishman," Scorsese never disappoints
","Scorsese was able to create a movie that adds something new to a genre that already has many classics. The movie is based on true events. It's a bit of history it was interesting to learn about Jimmy Hoffa and how the unions worked back then.
Scorsese also did a great job of showing the tragic dimensions that the destructive lifestyle of the mafia creates. In The Irishman the value of human life is explored in-depth and this is how it stands out. A movie over 3 hours long it spend much time exploring topics like the bonds between people and guilt. The Irishman was also beautifully shot and of course there were a lot of phenomenal performances. A memorable movie.",10,5,12,30 November 2019
Aquaman," A good popcorn movie
","There's a fairly standard storyline but this movie is a winner because of the amazing waterworld. The underwater sound, the graphics, the culture and just the overall attention to detail.
It's really creative and a great experience. The fight scenes were also fun and the jokes were good. For a 2+ hour movie Aquaman managed to keep me engaged most of the time.Someone new to movies will be blown away but experienced moviegoers might not appreciate it for the storyline but can appreciate it for the aesthetically pleasing spectacle.A good popcorn movie.",6,1,2,22 April 2019
Disturbia," Favorite Shia movie
","Shia probably has movies with more depth to them but Disturbia is my favorite because it's just so much fun. 2007 was a great year for me and Disturbia was just one of those movies that stuck with me from that year. Shia then was part of the 'New Hollywood'. Rubbing elbows with titans like Spielberg and in a lot of fun movies with stars like Megan Fox in Transformers. I also liked the second Wall St. Obviously it can never touch the original but Shia had enough charisma to carry the movie.Anyway Disturbia is a great fun movie. It got a playful feel to it. A teen who after a big tragedy gets into trouble, and is ordered by a judge to stay indoors. Sounds familiar? On a second viewing now during the pandemic the movie has a completely different feel to it. Bored being ' quarantined' he watches what goes on in his neighborhood from his window. His realm being a comfortable, classic American dream suburbia. I actually love the suburbia vibes. It's one of the big charms of the movie.Kale falls in love with his new neighbor. The beautiful Sarah Roemer who I had a huge crush on when I watched this movie. After this movie I hoped to see more of her but unfortunately she wasn't involved in many projects after this movie. Sarah being drop dead gorgeous and charismatic certainly helped me root for Shia's character to win her heart. I thought this was actually my favorite aspect of the movie. Even though it isn't labeled as a romance movie, romance plays a huge part. And it got one particularly great scene that is very memorable and wonderfully directed by D.J. Caruso.The suspense in the movie was also great. It's very well paced and keeps you engaged. In between all the antics there's something strange going on. A mystery that must be solved. Overall just a rich experience as far a watching movies goes. One of my favorite movies of the 2000s decade.",10,0,0,24 May 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Tour de force
","Everybody, I mean everybody was in this movie. Endgame is basically an epic superhero movie. It will be interesting to see if they can ever top this on this kind of scale.I regret not seeing Avengers in the theater. This is the type of movie that needs to be watched on the big screen. I avoided it because I thought it was hype and only for the most diehard fans. However I think moviegoers who aren't really into this genre can appreciate Endgame.It's got a lot of fun action. The action scenes were good the movie has some events which kept it from becoming predictable. There were many stories which kept it exciting. I liked the bond between the hero's. The jokes were funny and it really felt like a family.The visuals looked amazing. From the spaceships to the planets the CGI was flawless. I loved it. It showed that the creators put their heart and soul into making this movie. Avengers Endgame is an absolute treat.",10,49,78,30 November 2019
Aladdin," Vibrant movie
","I must say that I enjoyed this movie. I loved the vibe of the movie. A lot of the interactions were funny and charming. The visuals were stunning it was a real treat to watch. Not only the settings but also the way they visualized the magic. The joyful songs made me feel good, I found the characters interesting (good choice of actors) and of course seeing Will Smith play a genie was awesome.The downside is a loss of momentum in the second half of the movie and the movie could have been shorter. I still felt like the movie had plenty of good things for me to like it.",8,3,6,9 August 2019
Insidious," A scary PG-13 movie
","Insidious shows that you don't need gore and grotesque violence to make a scary movie. What makes this movie scary is that as a viewer you imagine what terror the family must be facing.Movies about spirits are not new. Yet Insidious makes it feel fresh with unique theories of the paranormal and the spirits whos malevolence are obvious due to their appearance. What adds to the unsettling feel is that there's something humanlike and subtle about their appearance that makes you imagine what horrific fate they must have had. Also the settings were very atmospheric.The strength of this movie is that it pulls you into the story. It makes you believe the story could be possible because a lot of attention was given to adding depth to the characters when needed but also leaving room for mystery when it was needed. It was all well paced.It's simply well written, directed and acted.",10,0,0,23 April 2019
Limitless," Illuminating the dark fields
","What would you do if you suddenly have great power? Limitless shows us the self-indulgent decisions the characters with power make.We're experiencing the movie from the point of view of the main character. Seeing him go from zero to hero.
Limitless doesn't focus on the moral responsibility that comes with great power. With the exception of a few people almost all the characters are sketchy people.The directing style is cool and stylish. The choice of music is perfect for the different moods of the movie. Fast-paced as we shift from one reality to another in a matter of seconds with stimulating visuals used as a vehicle to materialize the different mind states of the main character.A fun movie from the beginning of the decade.",10,0,0,8 August 2019
The Last King of Scotland," Coming of age under Amin
","The Last King of Scotland is a coming of age story. Nicolas a young Scottish doctor with the world at his feet and wants to explore the world. He decided to go to Uganda. The beautiful landscape and the vibrant locals immediately makes you fall in love with the country. The choice of upbeat, local music also played a big part in the feeling of carefree bliss in the sunny country with the warm people. It was very well-directed. On one hand you experience what Nicolas is experiencing: joy. On the other hand it adds to the shock when Nicolas is systemically pulled out of this reality by Amin and enters a harsh and confusing reality.I don't know how much of the story is true. I've watched some clips on YouTube afterwards with Amin to see what he was like in real life. Needless to say Forest Whitaker deservedly won an Oscar for his portrayal. He dominated every scene he was in. He did a great job of being two people at the same time. A charmer who feels like an old friend and then on the other hand a scary individual who just by body language is able to confuse and frighten. It all felt natural and when you watch Amin irl you see the similarities. Some videos on YouTube are reenacted like the pool scene. However I don't know how much of Nicolas story was true. I mostly watched this movie as fiction. The only thing I believed because it's common knowledge is that Amin committed a genocide.Nicolas is the viewer. He enters Uganda almost childlike. Not knowing anything about the Uganda under Amin. Learning as he goes along. And like the viewer he's spectating the story of a tragedy unfolding. Puzzle piece by puzzle piece he sees that things aren't what they seem. I liked this way of storytelling. It kept me engaged the entire time.The Last King of Scotland is an excellent movie that ages like fine wine. It gets better when you rewatch it.",10,0,1,11 April 2020
It Chapter Two," Better when rewatched
","A second time viewing Chapter 2. What can I say? I love it. It along with Halloween are my favorite horror franchises. They were the first horror movies I've seen as a kid in the 90s. Initially I felt like Chapter 2 was the weakest in the franchise but it has grown on me. I think you can like all the parts for different reasons.Initially I didn't like the long runtime. 3 hours for movies was popular in 2019. I sometimes feel a movie takes itself too seriously and it makes me not really want to watch it. However as a fan of IT it's actually a treat. You get more time to enjoy the movie. Also it's different watching it at home than in the theater when it first came out. You can split this up in two viewings. This is actually enjoyable as it feels like you're watching 2 movies for the price of 1.I also initially wasn't really impressed with the story. A criticism of the 1990 It was that the first part with the kids was better than with the adults, because their bond felt more natural. Because I wasn't really in the mood for this movie also because because back then I felt the 1990 version is superior, I wasn't really locked into the story. The chemistry is actually terrific in this version. The Losers Club have that special bond that made It 1990 a classic. A group of abandoned people must fight darkness and only have a small group of true friends to help them. That has always been the heart of It. Even though it's 27 years later the Losers Club are still as close as ever. This is the result of good acting and good writing. With almost 3 hours worth of movie a lot of time is spend giving the characters depth.
What I also liked is the humor. This is criticized but I liked it. A bit of comic relief made the friendship feel more genuine but also because it's a movie after all so a bit of comedy never hurts it.Lastly Pennywise was terrifying in this one. Always the menacing presence that somehow always seem to be present. I liked how there's different scenes with Pennywise than the 1990 version. There were some parts that are familiar but overall it was a fresh story.A very entertaining and solid sequel and I'm sure more fans will appreciate it more as time goes by.",10,0,3,11 April 2020
Back to the Future Part II," Welcome to Hell Valley!
","BTTF2 was my go to movie as a kid. I didn't watch part 1 until I was an adult. I first saw part 2 and 3 on VHS that I watched over and over again. It appealed to me as it's a colorful movie about the past, present and future with great characters who all have distinct, memorable and funny personalities.As I watch this decades later I can see why I loved the movie. People say it's a rehash of part 1 and that definitely could be true. Part 3 seems to have a tone of its own but part 1 and 2 are similar. Part 2 focuses on the dark timeline as Biff (who's always up to no good) changes the present as he becomes a powerful force in Hill Valley or should I say Hell Valley. I liked it. A great performance by Thomas F. Wilson. From his movements and delivery of lines Biff is one of the most memorable villains in movie history.Also I liked how they envisioned the future in 1989. It still looks cool in 2019. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd also have great performances as the Doc and Marty who are still as cool as ever trying to save the day. Getting into a lot of exciting and funny situations. Great fun movie.",10,1,2,18 July 2019
Creed II," All heart
","I haven't watched the first movie and its been a long time since I have watched Rocky movies. I only really remember Rocky Balboa (2006), the final fight in Rocky 5 and of course the death of Apollo Creed. So I watched pretty much as a standalone movie.What I didn't like were that some emotional scenes felt forced. Like it was dramatic for the sake of being dramatic. It didn't go with the flow of the movie. The other side is that more dramatic scenes were hits than misses. What I also didn't like was some of the decisions of the protagonist and the antagonist felt selfish considering the circumstances.What I liked was that this movie had a lot of heartwarming moments because of great strength of character shown by the characters. This is the heart of the movie and puts it over the top for me loving this movie. I also liked the strong performances by the actors, settings used and the way the boxing scenes in the ring were filmed. Overall I loved it",7,2,2,25 February 2019
Green Book," Nailed it
",I really have nothing but praise for the Green Book.The acting is top notch. Mortenson and Ali nailed all the nuances of their characters. The development of their friendship is at the heart of this movie and without their efforts this movie couldn't be this great.The transitions of scenes are also perfect. Every scene moves the plot forward and feels genuine. Keeping momentum is very difficult. I think why it worked is that they kept the storytelling simple but not too simple to the point of boredom. And also not too ambitious to the point you'll lose interest because it gets convoluted.The scenery was beautiful. The 1960s is visually stunning to see and also compounded to the surreal feel when underneath that beauty lies the ugliness of racism.To me it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.,10,0,3,5 April 2019
Da 5 Bloods," Some powerful history on the Vietnam war but overall a so-so movie
","I was left confused after watching this movie as critics were praising this movie. It had some good moments but it was also all over the place going from good scene to boring, by the book scene. The highlight for me was the reminder of how pointless the war in Vietnam was. Showing some of the brutal violence and atrocities it feels like a bizarre wake-up call of what is really happening in the world. As the war was before my time I remember only seeing the protests and talks about it on television. The gravity of the situation didn't really hit me until I watched this movie. So it definitely was eyeopening.
What added to the weirdness is that the war which seemed so important then seems so pointless and ignorant in 2020. Made me think about how many of the recent wars will eventually be looked back on as being a foolish mistake.The rest of the movie is plagued by all over the place directing and a movie that is too long. A few good scenes, an especially memorable scene by Delroy Lindo and some powerful history but the movie is also drowning in an abundance of boring, by the book scenes. It's on Netflix so I felt it was worth it just to learn how brutal the war in Vietnam was, but with its many flaws it never becomes a great movie.",6,0,0,1 July 2020
