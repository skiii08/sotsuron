Requiem for a Dream," Traumatic (In a good way...)
","Requiem for a dream lacks nothing when you think about it. Perfect plot, perfect cinematography, perfect ending and perfect acting. Only critic I can give is that some scenes are kind of repeated to make the message more intense, even though it is not needed. Watching this will deffinitely affect you and leave a mark in your life, meaning you most probably will never forget it.",9,1,1,1 November 2019
Trainspotting," Recommended!
",Trainspotting is one of the movies that you could watch over and over again and never get bored. Definitely a movie that could be your favourite after the first time watching it.,9,0,1,1 November 2019
