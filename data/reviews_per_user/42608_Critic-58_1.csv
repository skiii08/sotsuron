The Blair Witch Project," the BEST horror film ever made
","I thought the movie was EXCELLENT.  It was SO SCARY.  I couldn't fall asleep that night.  i thought I heart sticks breaking and rocks piling up, though it was just my imagination.  I thought it was particularly scary because I saw it on July 14, the second day it was released.  Many people;s opinions were affected by all the 'hype.'  If that's true..then fine, but I think all the reviews are true still.  I would watch it again and again. Heather, Michael, and Josh are one of the BEST actors I have ever seen. They started their acting careers the honest and right way.  Unlike all those idiotic, not talented actors on WB, who many people for some reason think are cute and whatever they happen to think, Heather, Mike, and Josh are great actors with A LOT of talent.  They are famous for their talent, not for their looks.  That is what many people these days have to realize. Anyone who likes actors simply for their looks, and then associates that with their talent,must have some problem.  I know there are many people like that.  (people who post messages on the gay and stupid BSB and NSYNC's message boards are like that.  go and see for yourself).  Sorry for the lecture, but it's true.  The Blair Witch Project is the Best horror film. The BEST action/sci-fi film is The Matrix. The best action film in Indiana Jones and The last crusade. The best sci-fi films are STAR WARS (A new hope, empire strikes back, and Return of the jedi.  Episode 1 was horrible)***** ***** ***** ***** ***** 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10",10,1,2,4 September 1999
