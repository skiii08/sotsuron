Blade Runner 2049," Overblown and not believable
","This new Blade Runner has a very simple story line, or 'narrative'. It lacks the complexity of the original story. The new story contains dumb assertions and clumsy plot turns even for science fiction. It is about an hour too long. The soundtrack is overbearing. The sets and locations are ridiculous. This is not a very good movie. I fell asleep in parts of it.",3,5,10,29 October 2017
Public Enemies," Who's your actor?
","This film proved two things: Johnny Depp can act, and Christian Bale can't. We all know Depp is a natural, who succeeds in any role. Now we also know for sure that Bale (who throws tantrums on the set while people are trying to work) is also a natural--at being stiff and grim in any role he gets. So that is pretty much what you have in this film. The rest of it -- the story, the style, the schtick, are all Mann and I do love it so. He's a director whose cinema style I appreciate because it pulls at my soul. No I don't know why but I love the moral intensity that just oozes from the visuals he creates. It's like having a good French dinner. I want to stay in it forever and let it love me.",8,0,1,29 December 2009
Moulin Rouge!," That's Entertainment!
","Moulin Rouge.  I wanted it to go on  for another two hours.   I Wanted to have been to the Moulin Rouge.  That's Entertainment!This movie has heart.  A story of Love, Freedom, Beauty, Truth, yes without being corny. Those themes, the most powerful in humanistic tradition, come alive in Moulin Rouge.  Thank you!It has music, not just music in the usual sense but music from our era put into the period of the movie, circa 1890 and it was made to work wonderfully.  Imagine Nirvana, in Gay Paree!  The new music fit in the old setting because their themes are the same: dancing, sex, exuberance, gettin' it on!Moulin Rouge has the mose beautiful, luscious woman in Nicole Kidman; my God what a photogenic set of eyes: hypnotic, teasing, deep, flirtatious.  She was deep in Eyes Wide Shut too.  This girl has it down to her heels: passion and knowledge.  She made a believer out of me, I'll tell you.This movie has color, presented by a most talented cinematographer and lighting director; it's perfect.  It jumps off the screen at you.  It caresses you, pulls you through the film like an opiate, increasing your pleasure with each frame.  More!I was so happy I saw Moulin Rouge!  I love Moulin Rouge!",Null,0,1,2 February 2002
The Dark Knight," Dark Screen (finally)
","This movie is too long by about 30 minutes. I was happy when the screen finally went dark. A filmmaker should be able to get his point across in under 2 hours or before the collective audience ass starts hurting.It's a comic book and the effects and makeup are really great, but still, some of it is too inexplicable and so beyond the possible that it undermines the characters. The Joker is deliciously strange and evil but if he can arrange those events that are so very complex, he starts to look more like a circus ringleader whose dancing dogs and fireworks are the real characters.The story was very hard for me to follow. I don't appreciate having to try so hard to figure out what and why things happen in a movie. I am still not sure why Mr. 'Two Face' went sour and frankly I didn't care that he did.There is a very heavy thematic effort here; much of film is trying to clearly define good vs. evil and the shifting ambiguity of that, to end with Batman becoming rather dark and isolated. I applaud this kind of effort in an action film, but here the authors take just too long to get there. I was itching to get out of my seat and had to force myself to sit through to the very end, and that's not good for any movie.",6,10,19,24 August 2008
The Wolf of Wall Street," Not that good of a movie
","I saw the movie Wolf of Wall Street and I didn't think it was that great like everyone has been saying it is. I saw lots of parallels between that movie and the movie Goodfellas (1990) from the same director - Scorcese. The same kind of voice-over, the same kind of characters, plot movements, etc. Scorcese was copying himself, which I thought was really really weak from such a renowned director. Like no original ideas in this one, just a lot of naked women added to it. I think the naked women shocked American audiences and made the movie be more remarkable here, but it's really not that good of a movie. The crooked shenanigans that the traders were doing on Wall Street stock exchanges to make tons of money so fast were phony and faked-very unrealistic and exaggerated. DiCaprio's acting was over the top, which I liked a lot that he could do that. That was the best part of the movie for me, was watching him.",5,2,3,3 March 2014
The Good Shepherd," Slow and Odd
","Matt Damon goes around with no expression wearing his dad's hat and overcoat, occasionally banging a woman. DeSneero directed the movie so that the character he plays in it is the BiggaBossa, Brando in Godfather. History is explained in one sentence lines here and there, so don't go out for pizza or you'll miss them. The movie moves so slowly that I thought I was asleep and dreaming in slow motion. There were 6 people in the theater. I was hoping for an intermission with a color cartoon. When it was over I was glad to get out of there. My date broke up with me. The old news clips of JFK was the best part of the whole thing. Do you have to be in a union to get work in films like this? The camera was set for Stink-O-Vision not Panavision. It would have been better if Jolie had a nude scene, but nooooo. I passed the time counting the kernels in my popcorn for something to do. I did fall asleep for a while, woke up, and was still looking at the same close-up.",1,3,11,14 January 2007
Gangs of New York," A Great One
","Gangs of New York is a very powerful historical drama done on a grand scale. It chronicles a little-known period of deep violent social disturbance during the mid 19th century in New York City, a disturbing time that is usually treated in American history education as a footnote overshadowed by stories of the American Civil War.  But the gangs and anti-draft riots of New York are real history, and this film forces it into our face and makes us see, hear, and feel the time.  It also illustrates the relation between microcosmic problems (of everyday life) and the larger problems of American society and the American state, in much the same way that the novel King Rat did years ago.  It is a remarkable film, a great one, a gift to Americans about their past.  It must have been a lot of work to make, and all those involved deserve congratulations.",Null,0,0,25 December 2002
The Nice Guys," Film School Quality Script
","I give it a 4 for the production value. The movie was in color, the camera was held steady, the lighting was good, the sets were well-staged, and the sound was clear. I also give it a 4 for the poor quality of the script. Unfortunately the good production value and the good acting by the principals could not elevate the script beyond the level of a film school senior project. How that script got made into an actual movie by professionals is beyond me, unless it simply signals that professional filmmakers these days have little idea as to script quality. How can the script be described to someone who hasn't seen the movie? I can say that the laughable jokes were weak, few, and far between, the characters were written without any depth (requiring the audience to create them), the story line was much too complicated and hard to follow for a silly comedy, and I wanted to movie to end about half an hour before it did. I did admire Crowe's performance. He is one of those rare people who can become the character they are asked to play. However I think he needs to loose a bunch of that weight if he wants to be an old actor some day.",4,5,14,29 May 2016
