Casablanca," Here's lookin' at this film again, kid.
","Full of romance, suspense, glamor, and comedy, 'Casablanca' achieves a level of quality not easily beaten. The films writing and allegorical themes are strong, with Bogart's performance leading the way. Beautifully shot, the film delivers strong meaning visually, utilizing such shots as when the camera tilts down from the slogan of the French revolution as the usual suspects are rounded up, or when Captain Renault discards the Vichy French water bottle. The characters are nicely and methodically developed over the course of the movie, and the acting reinforces this. The strongest aspect in my opinion was the writing, which skillfully provided thematic aspects like Rick's allegorical isolationist policies, clever comedic situations, and moving romance.",9,0,1,17 October 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Whimsical outlaws.
","I was immediately taken with this film when I saw the transition from the sepia tone to standard color. Cassidy and the Kid form a perfect comedic combination but don't shy away from being classic western bad-asses. their chemistry works excellently and it's clear why they are one of the great big screen partnerships. The montage in the middle of the film, showing the pair's journey to Bolivia with Etta, is done quite well using only pictures which each image looking authentic and iconic. The film is shot in a retrospective style, making the work seem like a story or tale. The end of this tale is represented perfectly in the frozen image of the duo rushing out of their cover, which fades to the sepia tone and closes their legend in iconic fashion.",9,1,2,11 December 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," A masterfully engaging and moving a-bomb of hardship.
","An enormously powerful and moving narrative of the hardships and perseverance of one poor farming family during the great depression, this film beautifully blends expert cinematography and moving dialogue. The Joad's struggle is hauntingly foreshadowed at the beginning in the Joad's abandoned house, where a mood of tragedy is established. Throughout the film, use of deep contrast and shadow is appropriately used to emphasize moments of despair and sullenness, the preacher often comes in and out of shadow and plays a key role in Tom Joad's development. I found the mother to be exceptionally engaging, owning most of the emotional power and meaning in the dialogue. While the film is mainly a constant bludgeoning of sadness, and it feels as though the Joad's will never be at peace, there are moments of relief. The grandpa serves a dose of comic relief, and the government run housing camp is the only place happiness seems to exist. Over the course of the film you begin to feel connected to the Joads, and start thinking like them. As the Joad's enter the displaced farmers' camp, you feel a sense of apprehension along with Tom, and you find yourself waiting for the next injustice to present itself. You then grow attached to this haven, and feel accomplished when the police scheme against it is thwarted. The beautiful photography, top tier dialogue, and moving story all blend to produce an engaging style typical of great movies; a category in which this film rightly fits.",8,1,2,15 October 2010
The Graduate," Hilarious, rebellious, and risqu√©.
","This crazily interesting film is a great adventure into the changing mentality of the 60's, full of cleverly funny moments and creative use of editing and sound. The standout moments in the editing comes during the montage of Ben's affair with Mrs. Robinson, where he walks through doors and jumps out of his pool and ends up in the hotel or in bed. The shots create a sense of unity between Ben's monotonous life and his love affair. There is a notable shot which utilizes sound, or the lack of it, to perfectly illustrate Ben's feelings; when Ben is dragged out in his scuba gear by his father, there are cuts to POV shots from inside the suit, these shots include only the sound of the suits re-breather and represent Ben's feelings of his disconnection from the world of his parents. The final scene is also iconic, as Ben and Elaine triumphantly elope, the camera continues to film them for some time during which they seem to realize what radical things they have done and seem a bit uneasy about it all, which is a fitting allegory for the times.",8,1,2,16 December 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A crazy good romp through human personalities.
","With all the elements of a masterfully crafted film, this title does its part to expose the nature of man and the ends to which he will go and be pushed. Nicholson's role as a patient pretending to be mentally ill seems perfect for him, and he plays the part with humor, violence, and tenderness when appropriate. His antics in the institution inspire real growth and therapy for the other patients, as opposed to the iron fisted order imposed by the loathsome Nurse Ratched, who's name i found particularly appropriate as she was always manipulating the patients. I found her strangulation to be particularly satisfying, no doubt a product of the great performances and writing of the film. Aesthetically not too much caught my eyes from an artistic point of view, although certain scenes, like the fishing scene and the closing scene with the chief walking over the hills as a silhouette, were done with profound meaning. Overall this film works as a commentary and study into the lives of some mentally unstable people, and shows the cycle of craziness begetting craziness.",9,0,2,5 December 2010
