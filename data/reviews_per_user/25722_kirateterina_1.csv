Walk the Line," About the man who always «walk the line»
","I watched the movie on the 26 of February and only then I learned that this is not a simple day. On this day the famous musician would be 86 years old.
The film tells us the story of life of a magnificent figure in country music, whose contribution can't be denied. Although, it may seem trivial, but it doesn't deprive it special charm. The atmosphere of those times was transferred wonderfully by wonderful music and scenery.
The movie has everything to please any audience: love, relations, sex, drugs and attractive actors, look very similar to their prototypes. It's worth noticing that the leading actors and script was approved by Johnny Cash himself, saying that it was very true to life. Unfortunately, Johnny Cash couldn't enjoy the full version of the film, because the movie was released after the death of the musician.
I especially want to mention talented actors: Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix. They are perfectly got into characters. This is confirmed by numerous awards and nominations such as Golden Globe Awards and Academy Awards. Moreover, all the vocal parts were performed by the actors themselves and their work was duly appreciated by critics.
This movie is absolutely worth seeing, if you want to imbue the atmosphere, breath in a fresh air and listen to really good music.",9,0,0,3 March 2018
