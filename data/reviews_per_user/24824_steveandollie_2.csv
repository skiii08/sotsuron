Skyfall," James Bond? More like James' boast, more like.
","This afternoon, me and my fine friend Steven went into town to watch Madagascar 3. Sadly due to a mixup at the cinema we ended up having to watch that bloody Skyfall film. We tried complaining to the manager but he was more upset that we had drilled a hole in the side of the building so we could see a film rather than buy a ticket. It's a good thing he didn't find the toilet hole or we'd really be for it.I've got no idea why people are getting so excited over all this Bond rubbish. Apparently they've made four hundred films with him in it so apparently it's some sort of big deal. Basically old crust features Daniel Craig plays James Bond, some spoilt little boy who gets to go on holiday all the time, and his Mum is some scraggy old bonebag who literally lets him get away with murder. He's always being naughty and bullying the weaker boys, and his Mum doesn't even bat an eyelid as he strangles them or shoots them in the face or feeds them to a crocodile. It's disgraceful, what that bully needs a good clout, I tell you if I was his Dad I would take off my belt and whip his bare bottom until it was shredded with gore. I also would take the opportunity to squeeze his butt-cheeks as although he is a nuisance, Daniel Craig is a dishy hunk.The film focuses on Bond's relationship with his mother and how he learns to respect her. At the start of the film their relationship is pushed to breaking point when he has yet another of his ridiculous, destructive tantrums. He gets all upset because some boy steals one of his Megadrive games and chases him across India, causing as he ploughs his Landrover through crowds of people and smashes up a train with a digger. Finally brings the hammer of discipline down and has him shot in the heart. A bit extreme you might think, when she could have got him on the naughty step or my buttock-based punishment, but luckily he falls in a river which washes the bullet out or something because in the next scene he's fine and partying with a scorpion.Despite having his guts torn up with lead he still refuses to show any respect to his Mum, choosing to sardonically call her 'M' or 'Marm', rather than 'Mummy-wummy' or 'Lovely mother' like you're supposed to. M is even worse, coldly acknowledging him as '007'. The fact she has to add the double zero makes me shudder to think how many kids she's actually had. We know a lady like that in town, her womb keeps plopping out on the street, it's disgusting.But anyway, back to the story. I should probably warn you that this review contains SPOILERS, but if you really want to spoil yourself, you should watch Mr Bean's Holiday. It's a much better film. So yeah, after Bond is finished with being dead this other boy called Saliva turns up who is supposed to be Bond's brother or something, and he's really upset with 'M' because a long time ago she lost him at the shops and he got tortured by a bunch of bad sailors. So he goes off in a sulk and spends all his pocket money on guns and soldiers so he can shoot his old Mum's bum off. We've all been there. First he tries to kill her with a big bomb, then with some bullets, and finally a helicopter full of bullets. James does his best to stop him by setting a series of home alone style traps around his house, horribly murdering all of Saliva's gang and then kills him with his handy pocket sword. It looks like Bond has saved the day, but sadly it turns out M has cut herself anyway and all her blood falls out. Bond cradles her bony old bits in his hands, his veneer cracks and he finally cries for his Mummy. Probably because he knew the money would dry up and he wouldn't be able to go to Disneyland Paris this year.A lot of people criticised this film as Bond is starting to look a little old and tired. I totally agree, Daniel Craig is 44, far too old to be playing a cheeky little boy. So inevitably M has to be even older! Luckily they've got saggy old 128 year old Judy Dense from the Calendar Girls. I was terribly worried that she would forget what film she was in and try to take her clothes off again, but fortunately she didn't. That's the sign of a good director.My main problem with the Bond franchise is that it's so unrealistic. Ordinary people can't do the things 007 does like shoot big guns or drive fast cars or have a girlfriend or anything so they find it hard to relate to it. I'd much prefer it if he just did things us regular folks, like make some marmite toast or visit his Nan. This overblown orgy of sex and violence is just showing off, and frankly I got sick of him rubbing our noses in his luxurious lifestyle. If I wanted that I'd go look at the posh people shopping in fancy establishments in Lidl or Aldi.I do have to admit the film did rub off on us a little bit, leaving us a little bit jealous. We tried to get a raise in our weekly allowance from Dad so we could be more like Bond but no matter how much we pleaded, shouted or begged he wouldn't give in. In the end we gave up and put him back in his grave.And because of that we have to go to court for some reason. That's why we're giving this film 2/10.",2,4,15,18 November 2012
Prometheus," Stay away from those clams, lady.
","This afternoon, me and my best friend Steven borrowed some money from Mum's handbag and went to see that new movie that everyone is talking about 'Prometheus', the hotly anticipated prequel to Ridley Scott's sci- fi horror masterpiece, 'E.T: The Extra Terrestrial'. There's a lot of excitement as it's is supposed to answer many of the questions surrounding the original film, giving more background to where the alien came from and why his spaceship looked exactly like the barrel from Pop- up Pirate. But does it provide answers to these burning questions? Does it bloody! The aliens don't even look anything like the scary ones in E.T! There's not even a single bicycle or toothy little boy in it. What rot.Despite this initial disappointment, the plot isn't half bad. It's a classic tale - bunch of scientists and a robot go on a holiday to outer space and have a great time mucking around with some black slime they find in a hole. But one of them has to spoil the fun by eating too many oysters and ends up having a messy belly operation. Remember kids, if you don't want to end up with a squid in your tummy make sure your oysters are dead before you eat them (If they smell putrid and make a clacking sound when you tap them, they're safe).As you can imagine, this film is pretty scary. I found some of the action scenes in Police Academy 6 quite startling, but let me tell you, some of the scenes in Prometheus takes soiling yourself to a whole new level. And it's easy to see why, the film features three of the most frightening things known to man: space aliens, dark caves and mysterious ooze. When the crew of the Prometheus entered that scary old dark cave I could barely keep hold of my Fanta with fright, but when I found it was both dark AND full of murderous oozey space aliens I was so spooked I ended up trying to sew my eyes shut with my shoelaces.Now, there's been a lot of people who have been getting all upset about the problems with the plot, and I do agree with them. You could say it has more holes than some swiss cheese (joke lol!). For a film that was supposed to answer questions there were too many things left unexplained. For instance, who built that big spaceship? How come none of the characters had to go to the toilet during the film when I had to go four times in the first hour? The fact that Ridley Scott couldn't address these simple issues makes me seriously consider his skill as a director.Anyway, it wasn't all bad. For me, the stand out performance was Michael Fassenbender's fantastic turn as David, the Machiavellian synthetic man. It made us suspicious of our own friend David who talks a bit weird, so later that night we went his house with a knife to see if he had milk instead of blood. However, he wouldn't stop screaming and crying (artificial?) tears so we let him off the hook, but not before we threw his PS3 down the stairs. That's one machine that isn't going to play naughty tricks on us. The rise of the machines is averted, for now. As for the rest of the cast, there were far too many people on that spaceship for my liking. The queue for the bathroom in the morning must've been diabolical, perhaps that's why everyone was saving their wee up until they got back to Earth. Anyway, here are my thoughts on the rest of those urine retaining space knuckleheads.Dr Sure: Oyster Mum. She was supposed to be from England, but she sounded more like her mouth was full of antiseptic wipes. Didn't like her.Holloway: He was wipe lady's boyfriend and I think he pretended he wanted to go to deep space so she'd kiss him but when he got there he didn't like it. He saw that the cave was scary so he pretended to be ill but they called his bluff and incinerated him.Vickerz: My feelings of her are ambiguous. She was pushy and rude, but her tightly fitting space costume made me feel funny in my tummy.Benny and Bones: Benny and bones don't really do much in the film. They pilot the ship in the first act and then pop up again to perform a suicide mission in the last twenty minutes. It's weird that they were so ready to sacrifice their lives despite barely participating in the mission at all up until that point. I know how they felt though, sometimes when you are working in a group if you don't speak up, after a while you find yourself volunteering for anything just to feel included.The Wolfman & Specs: Wolfman and Specs were the most sensible crew members. When they discovered that the dark cave was full of alien corpses they decided to go back to the ship where it was safe. But unfortunately instead of going back to the ship where it was safe they wandered deeper into the cave and died in the dark in a pile of tears and cobra bites. As anyone who has got lost in Wookey Hole will tell you, hold Dad's hand and don't ever, ever let go.Overall, Prometheus has everything a great film should have; actors, sound, colours and a long list of names at the end. Despite it's shortcomings I have to award it five stars, mainly because I have no other frame of reference. It's the only film I've ever seen at the cinema, the only other film I've seen is Police Academy 3 which Mum taped off the telly in 1992, and I've watched that so watched that so many times the tracking has gone all mental.",10,25,53,22 June 2012
