10 Cloverfield Lane," 10 'Cloverfield' Lane
","When the film was first announced, there was a lot of speculation on how it was possible for J.J to create a sequel to Cloverfield in absolute secrecy, the short answer is, he didn't. The film started off as a movie titled 'The Cellar' the script was then bought by J.J's Bad Robot production studio and reworked into the movie we have today. Now the movie itself is a psychological thriller that takes place in an underground bunker created by a man named Howard (John Goodman's character) he finds a girl named Michelle (MEW) who he found in the wreckage of a car crash. As the movie progresses, she slowly starts to question if Howard is telling the truth about the outside world being unsustainable. Which leads to her and Emmet (JGJ) to attempt a break out. All three actors do a fantastic job, especially John Goodman, and you can't help but empathize with all of them in some way. Without spoiling anything, if you see this expecting it to be a Cloverfield sequel, you'll be disappointed.",8,5,9,11 March 2016
Suicide Squad," DC'S saving grace
","Suicide Squad wasn't a film that was particularly on my radar, I intended on seeing the film solely to see Jared Leto's portrayal of the Joker and Harley Quinn's cinematic debut. From a critical perspective, David Ayer's entry into the DCEU isn't very well made. The fact that he supposedly wrote the script in only six weeks may explain why there are glaring plot holes, weak characterization and a dull finale. What does work however is the chemistry between the cast and the enjoyment factor of the film, and that's where Suicide Squad shines and the general audience will likely get a kick out of the film as they did with Guardians of the Galaxy given that the two have the same vibe. The standout performances are Viola Davis' as Amanda Waller who just fits the character perfectly and is essentially ripped from her comic book incarnation. Will Smith as Deadshot is basically Will Smith which isn't necessarily a bad thing, besides Harley he had the most development out of the Squad and is more of a anti- hero than full on villain. Lastly Margot Robbie gives a decent performance, while it takes a while to get used to her interpretation of the character, it grows on you during the film and she has a couple of good lines and she has great chemistry with Jared Leto's Joker for the short time we see the two together. The villain (Enchantress) is sadly very underwhelming and fills out of place, her and her brother (who isn't even given a name) hardly do anything of relevance in the film. Her minions are basically zombies and seeing the Squad fight and shoot through them isn't very interesting and the final fight feels very anti climatic and oddly enough is sorta a rip off of the original Ghostbusters finale. Overall Suicide Squad is an enjoyable film with a few great performances and lines. After the mixed reception MoS and BvS garnered for their tone and treatment of beloved characters, this is a breath of fresh air for those who want something different from the DCEU and as long as you aren't expecting an Oscar worthy script or the most original plot you should be fairly pleased.",6,1,2,6 August 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," BvS Dawn of Justice
","It's quite apparent now that BvS has been getting very negative reviews by critics, mainly on the site Rotten Tomatoes. However, as Henry Cavill himself put it, how the audience and the fans feel about the film is what really matters, and both will enjoy BvS despite what critics may lead you to believe. The film deals with the consequences of Superman's actions in MoS, with people all over the globe split on how they should view this god like character. Ben Affleck is a terrific Batman, easily the most brutal Bats we've ever seen on screen. The supporting characters like Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons, and Gal Gadot all do great in their respective roles. A lot of the disdain for the film comes from the tone of the film, it's constantly shifting. The first and second halves of the film feel completely different. There are several plots running throughout the movie, and while most resolve themselves by the end of the film, a few of them are just pointless and add nothing to the film or DCEU. The film looks great, the cinematography and fight scenes are well done, Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL composed a great soundtrack as well. To sum up, BvS is an enjoyable, emotional, entertaining ride that opens up several doors in the DCEU. While there may be a lot going on in the film, and there could have been more time to develop Batman and Superman, it doesn't hurt the film enough to ruin the movie.",7,2,4,26 March 2016
