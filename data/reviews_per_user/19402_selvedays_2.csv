The Ring," A fine successor to The Sixth Sense
","This is one creepy movie, and a fine successor to the film The Sixth Sense. Naomi Watts Plays a reporter who stumbles a cross a tape that not only messes with your mind but kills you within seven days after you see it. The movie plays with your senses thought out it's viewing, and grabs you so tight that when it's over you will try to surface from your couch for air. Creepy, scary, and down right disturbing, this film will go down as one of the great ones.Grade: A",9,1,1,26 March 2003
The Mummy Returns," Better Than The first
",I really liked this film. The Cast is great (Especially Rachel Weisz and Brendan Fraser) and the special effects were very good. Much Better than The original. I hope they Bring back The original Cast for part 3 because if they don't.  The series will with out a doubt suffer for it.,10,1,1,7 April 2003
