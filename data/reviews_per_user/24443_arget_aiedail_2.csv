Marie Antoinette," 'Less' than I expected; plot less, emotionless, humorless, pointless, the list could go on...
","The trailer was interesting, but not enough for me to go see it in theater. I found it strange that there wasn't much talking, but thought there would be more in the movie.Boy, was I wrong! The entire film probably had 200 distinguished (and by that I mean ones that could actually be heard, not just muttering in the background) lines! That might have been okay, if it had been a very stylized movie with a PLOT, but unfortunately there is no plot, either. There was *one* point in the movie, which lasted no more than two minutes, where I actually felt something for one of the characters, and felt like the character was feeling something, not just wandering around in a daze of manners and expensive gowns speaking in a bland voice.In my opinion, movies have to have at least two of the following: drama, romance, action, mystery, or a highly convoluted plot. 'Marie Antoinette' had none of those.",2,1,2,30 October 2008
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Another plot less movie
","So Butch and Sundance run around being chased by some men they don't recognize, and whom they never see up close nor confront. They could give up their lifestyle and try a profession other than robbing banks, but no, they go to Bolivia (because they'll really blend in well *there*) to get away and rob more banks. Pretty soon (but not fast enough) the natives catch on that the two of them are the same white honkies that have been robbing their banks and after a bunch of killing and running, surround them with soldiers and shoot them dead. Hurray.This was a boooring movie, despite my mother's assurances before we watched it that it was great. I think she just thinks Robert Redford was hot when he was young.",5,5,9,30 October 2008
