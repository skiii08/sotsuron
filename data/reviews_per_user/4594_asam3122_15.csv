The Longest Yard," Not the Best Adam Sandler movie, but in the top 5
","Adam Sandler Movie Top 5 List1. Happy Gilmore 2. Billy Madison 3. Bulletproof 4. Longest Yard 5. Mr. DeedsI came to this movie thinking it would be like the Waterboy. Adam Sandler plays Paul Crewe, a former quarterback, who after trashing his girlfriend's car, gets sentenced to three years. James Cromwell plays Warden Hazen. He is a cold, evil man who brings Crewe to Texas. When Crewe suggests that the semi-pro guard team does a 'tune up' game, the Warden tells Crewe to recruit some convicts to be the other team.What follows are hilarious and sad obstacles. Burt Reynolds plays Nate Scarsborough, a former Heighsman Trophy winner who helps the convicts get their game on.Chris Rock plays Caretaker. He is the guy with all the connections to different people.Nelly does a great job playing Earl Meggot, a running back. Overall, this movie isn't bad. It's probably in my top 50. But in the end, the original will always be better.8/10.",8,0,2,31 May 2005
Rocky V," Deserves More Than The 4.0 Rating
","As of January 3, 2007, 'Rocky V' has a rating of 4.0. And I feel that it deserves better. It has the same feel as all of the other 'Rocky' movies. It is a standard underdog type of tale. The story is realistic until the end kind of. And the 5th installment deals a lot more with Rocky Balboa's family life than his fighting and such.After the events in 'Rocky IV,' Balboa returns home to the USA to great media and country applause. But that soon ends when Rocky is pronounced unfit to box and he loses all his money with a financial error by his lawyer. So he moves back to the old neighborhood in Philly with Adrian and Robert, Jr., his son. Paulie makes quite a lot of appearances, but it is unsure whether he lives with his brother-in-law's family or not.And that's when Rocky meets Tommy Gunn, a hotshot fighter who requests Rocky's help. He has enormous potential, but he is young and he refuses to listen. When Gunn wins fights, but craves more, he ditches Rocky for a big time promoter. But Gunn is always in his mentor's shadow as he learns after the fights and money don't bring him the love of the fans. For its like Adrian Balboa says, 'They love you because you won with heart, not your fists.' But Tommy, not knowing that, feels that he has to beat Rocky with his fists to show he is the more superior fighter.With plenty of good suspense and lessons, the 5th installment in the 'Rocky' series is a winner, but most don't seem to feel that way.",9,6,8,2 January 2007

Saw III," If you can take the gore, its excellent
","I did not come into this movie with any expectations whatsoever. If it was a bad third installment, well, we're getting used to them (Final Destination 3, Santa Clause 3). Well, this is one of the better endings to a trilogy.In this sophomore sequel to 2005's Saw II, John Kramer aka Jigsaw is sick and near death. He is terminally ill, but apparently refuses to accept the fact. To keep him alive, Jigsaw and his protégé, Amanda, kidnap Dina, an anti-depressant-taking doctor in a crumbling marriage. Dina is forced to 'play a game' to keep Jigsaw alive. As long as Jigsaw stays alive, so does she.Angus MacFayden gives a magnificent performance as Jeff, a father who feels that he failed his family when his son was struck and killed by a drunk driver. He is also kidnapped by Jigsaw and put through a series of tests. At the end, Jigsaw promises that he will meet his son's murderer. Jigsaw's tests are about Jeff's morality and forgiveness.With extra gory scenes of torture and decapitation, the third installment in the Saw series is by far the most graphic, but also the greatest. I was told that it had lack of surprise. This may be true, but the movie makes up for the lack of surprise with a surplus of suspense. It will keep you going until the end.9/10",9,1,2,5 November 2006
Batman Begins," Fear comes in many forms...
","I was excited when I first saw Batman in 1989. It was a great movie. The sequel, Batman Returns (1992), was also good. Then, Batman Forever spoiled it for me, even though skillful acting by Tommy Lee Jones and Val Kilmer. I walked out of Batman and Robin, despite George Clooney being in it. Then, Batman Begins came to theaters.Batman Begins focuses on Bruce Wayne's childhood and early years as Batman. He is guided by his friend Lucius Fox and butler Alfred Pennyworth. The movie also deals with Bruce's fear of bats, and how he uses what he fears to strike fear into others. Christopher Nolan delivers a dark tale. He proves that fear comes in many forms. Batman Begins is definitely on my top 10 list for 2005.Cast:Bruce Wayne/Batman- Christian Bale Alfred Pennyworth- Michael Caine Lt. James Gordon- Gary Oldman Carmine Falcone- Tom Wilkinson Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow- Cillian Murphy Ras Al-Guhl- Ken Watanabe Henry Druicard- Liam Neeson Lucius Fox- Morgan Freeman Rachel Dawes- Katie HolmesBatman Begins= 10/10",10,0,1,4 July 2005
The Dark Knight," The Movie That I've Been Waiting for All Summer
","I remember in my younger days watching the campy (not necessarily bad) Batman movies with a wide variety of actors from Adam West to Michael Keaton to George Clooney. I remember being a child and being especially afraid of Jack Nicholson's Joker in Tim Burton's version of Batman in 1989. But I didn't even imagine the Joker as I saw him tonight. Heath Ledger is by far the scariest Batman character, I believe, to ever be brought to life on the big screen. The purple-suited prankster is more in love with anarchy than schemes and such. With a dark sense of humor, you find yourself laughing at some unexpected places in the film. But why not put a smile on that face? Enter Bruce Wayne, our model hero, to save the day...or so one would think. But when the going gets tough, Wayne questions his place in Gotham City. Now that new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is in town, maybe Gotham deserves a 'hero with a face,' as Bruce puts it. Maybe they deserve the knight in shining armor instead of the knight in midnight black bat suit.With plenty of humor, character development, and action, 'The Dark Knight' keeps you guessing and hanging on until the end credits roll. With the brilliant Nolan brothers writing and directing once again, how could this have failed? Who ever saw Batman as not just a figure in the dark, but a dark figure himself? While the original TV series was campy and comic, 'Begins' and 'Knight' have surely cast that image away from the franchise. And all I have to say is...bring on some more.Supporting performances from Eric Roberts, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine make 'The Dark Knight' a summer winner. Hats off to all involved for the entertainment and a job well done.",10,1,3,18 July 2008
The Departed," Excellent mix of black comedy, drama, and action
","This is quite possibly Martin Scorcese's best picture since 'Goodfellas.' It may surpass 'Goodfellas,' in fact. There is an excellent mix of drama, black comedy, and action. It is made even better with excellent writing, direction by Scorcese, and acting by its leads.We begin the movie with a monologue by Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the crime lord of Boston, Massachusetts. It then shows young Colin Sullivan and how he begins a relationship with Costello doing odd jobs. When older Colin (Matt Damon) becomes a police officer, Costello has a new informant in the State Police.Enter the mind of Billy Costigan (Leo DiCaprio), a young undercover cop infiltrating the Boston Mob for the State Police. With a family history of criminals, Billy has an easy time fitting in with Costello's crew. He uses paroxysms of violence to show that he can defend himself and that he is not to be pushed around.When moles are believed to be in the State Police and the Boston Mob, Captain William Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Costello are on the lookout for suspicious behavior among their 'allies.' With both Sullivan and Costigan getting paranoid, the movie goes deeper into the BPD and the criminal underworld. Great supporting performances from Ray Winstone and Mark Wahlberg make 'The Departed' a real treat to watch.10/10",10,0,0,5 November 2006
Hitch," Will Smith and Kevin James are awesome together.
","When seeing that 'King of Queens' star Kevin James was in 'Hitch', I wondered how he'd do on the big screen. Well, let's put this movie in a nutshell.Albert Brenemman(James) is a klutz, who falls in love with billionaire Alegra Cole(Amber Valletta). He thinks he has no chance with her, so he calls Alex Hitchens, or Hitch.Alex Hitchens(Smith) is the 'date doctor.' He is hired by 'clients' to help them get the women they love. He refuses to work with clients who just want sex.Together, James and Smith have amazing chemistry on the screen together. Will is smooth, except when romancing the newspaper columnist who's trying to track him down.James is always nervous and fidgety, especially around Allegra.Overall, the rating of this movie is a 9/10. It's not expecting an Oscar. It's just a feel-good movie.Rated PG-13 for Language and Some Strong Sexual References.-asam",9,1,3,15 June 2005
Bruce Almighty," With a message
","Bruce Almighty- 2003. Stars Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston, and Steve Carrell. ****out of *****.Bruce Nolan is a down-on-his-luck news reporter who blames God for everything. After getting fired from his job, God decides to page him. When Bruce gets to God's office (humorously played by Morgan Freeman...I know that was kinda late.)decides to give Bruce all his powers.Well, despite many humorous parts in the movie, Bruce Almighty does have a good message. My review...8/10.Oh yeah...Jennifer Aniston plays Grace Connelly, Bruce's girlfriend.Overall, 8/10.",8,0,1,26 April 2005
Casino Royale," Bland, But Yet Bold...Craig, Please Stay
","I am not a huge James Bond fan. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy all the movies, and from what I've seen James Bond is best portrayed by Sean Connery. But if Sean Connery didn't ever play Bond in Dr. No, then Daniel Craig would be the best. He plays the character perfectly with lapses of emotion and then no emotion.The story places Bond in a poker game with 9 other players. If the funds go to a sadistic French man, then terrorist organizations will have 150 million dollars more.With a beautiful treasury agent (Eva Green) at his side, Bond plays poker and plays poker and plays poker some more. 'Casino Royale' is the Bond film that hardcore fans have been waiting for. Craig shows how fantastic an actor he is in this picture filled with violence, womens, and, who knew, comedy.",10,0,2,18 November 2006
The Ringer," 'When did we get ice cream?'
","'The Ringer' is the story of Steve Barker, who, one day, is sent to fire his friend, the janitor, Stavi. When Stavi explains that he has five kids and that his wife died, Steve decides not to fire him, and to give him a job at his apartment complex mowing the lawn. When the mower malfunctions, Stavi loses some fingers. The surgery to give him his fingers back costs 28,000 dollars. Steve doesn't have that kind of money, and there's no way he can get it on time.Then, we meet Uncle Gary, an insensitive jerk who is down 40,000 dollars. He, like Steve, doesn't have any money. When he hears his loan shark talk about an inspirational handicapped man named Jimmy Washington, Uncle Gary thinks he can get his ex-high school drama nephew (Steve) to act mentally handicapped for the Special Olympics, which are coming to town.While at the Special Olympics under the false name Jeffy Dahmor, Steve meets Lynn. Lynn is a sweet lady, who is helping out with the mentally handicapped individuals.Despite a few opening incidents with the other handicapped people, they discover Steve is a fake. But they refuse to turn him in because they want someone to beat Jimmy Washington, who turns out to be a jerk.My review reflects, in my opinion, one of the funniest lines in the movie. Steve and the others find Lynn's boyfriend at a movie theater with another girl. When he is found by Lynn with the others, he explains that he took them to the mall and then out for ice cream.'When did we get ice cream?!' Rated PG-13 for Language, Crude Humor, Drug References, and Sexual Humor, 'The Ringer' gets a 10/10 in my book. It's got a good message in it. You just have to look.",10,36,59,24 December 2005
Click," Mixed Feelings
","'Click' stars Adam Sandler as Michael Newman, a workaholic architect that is putting his job first and family second. Frustrated because he can't turn on the television one night, he storms into Bed, Bath, and Beyond to get a universal remote that can control everything from his ceiling fan to his television. Michael meets Morty (Chrisopher Walken), an strange inventor who gives Michael his 'universal' remote: a remote to remote control his universe. Fast forwarding, rewinding, and pausing ensue, but the remote soon programs itself to Michael's preferences: fast forwarding through arguments with his wife (Kate Beckinsale), promotions, and sickness.I have mixed feelings about this movie. The first half was like an old Adam Sandler movie. Crude remarks and cursing kids open the first half. The second half is somewhat a comedy about how we miss the little things in life. But in the end, 'Click' was a fun summer movie that shows us that Adam Sandler can do anything from comedy to drama.8/10.",9,4,11,24 June 2006
Cinderella Man," What a Knockout
",Washed up boxer Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) is longing for another chance at the glory he once had. With the help of his manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) he is given one more shot at the belt. He goes up against Max Baer. Baer has already killed two men in the ring. Will Jim be the third? 'Cinderella Man' is a truly spectacular picture with supporting roles from Renee Zellwegger and Craig Bierko. Films like this show us that a second chance is possible. All you need is hope. Someone deserves and Oscar.'Cinderella Man' is rated PG-13 for Intense Boxing Violence and Some Language.10/10,10,0,0,4 August 2005
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Has its Moments, But 'Anchorman' Will Always Be Funnier
","Will Ferrell has always been funny and he will always be funny in my book. From his early days on SNL to the hilarious 'Anchorman,' his antics have become a pop culture icon of the 90's and 2000's. And now he comes to theaters and Blockbuster with 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.' Although it seems slightly less funny than 'Anchorman,' 'Talladega' has its moments when its laugh after laugh.Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) is a champion race car driver. Taking advice from his deadbeat semi-pro race car driving dad, Ricky becomes obsessed with the phrase, 'If you aren't first you're last.' So with his friend, Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reilly) at his side, Ricky is an unbeaten driver...until the hilarious French driver, Jean Girard (Sascha Baron Cohen) comes to America to beat him.After suffering a terrible crash in a race with Girard, Ricky goes to a hospital where he believes he is paralyzed. It is up to Lucius Washington (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Cal to get him up and driving again. But when the speed-loving Bobby won't go fast anymore, his fans, his wife, and sometimes his best friend abandon him.With no one on his side, but his deadbeat dad and his loving mom, Ricky must learn to race again and race against the ever-smart Girard. All the actors play their parts perfectly, but I couldn't help but feel like I enjoyed 'Anchorman' more as a comedy. With Ferrell's group of friends as supporting actors, 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' is worth the $4.27 I spent at Blockbuster for it and possibly the 15 dollars I'll pay in the future for it, but I'm not rushing to get it like I was the day 'Anchorman' came out.7/10",7,1,2,16 December 2006
