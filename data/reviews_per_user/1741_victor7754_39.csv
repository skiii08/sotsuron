Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It gives every reason why the WTC was bombed.
","Borat? A potty humor look at American Culture through the eyes of a Fictitious Kazakhstani TV journalist. It is an insult to our country as well as Kazakhstan, poking fun at everyone in a crude manner. Embarrassment, especially in an emotional time for many of faith. The film is full of clich√© characters and situations; i.e greedy Jews, horny Homosexuals, 'Domb' Blonds, Homely Women... The film possesses a strong stance in reducing todays population in order to rid the world of such waste. Borat is a reminder of pre Nazi Berlin; an apathetic world lost in pettiness and indulgence, lost in boredom . If we look beyond the mist of terrorism and perhaps understand why someone is trying to stop us or...perhaps is asking for help. What is happening to us if we can not see the truth of what our wants are doing to others? The American dream can not be the way for it was not the way before.Borat is a caricature of translation lost. The problem is that the audience gets it and goes to bed smiling...not seeing the ugly truth hidden underneath the films true message: That if we do not get rid of our prejudices we are going to self destruct. Democracy wasted. The problem with American Democracy is that it is Capitalistic. It feeds the ego with vanity, lust, waste, envy, greed, pride, and avarice. Once evolution gets rid of the ego only then will we prosper and love one another for existing in this beautiful paradise. I am, says Christ, whereas Christianity dissolves the individual. Borat is a victim, as we all seem to be in this world that keeps seeking this so called progress. That's not funny. So keep laughing and making fun of everyone. Keep paying for this war. 1,246,401 Iraqi deaths since our invasion. Brothers, Sisters, Children, Mothers, Fathers, We are all guilty!",1,5,14,11 November 2006
Casablanca," It's all in the script!Flawless.
","Casablanca's formula is superb. The script contains all the elements of classical cinema with a wonderful array of characters blending in politics, passion, romance, war, self sacrifice, nationality, heroism, mystery, love, friendship, intrigue, patriotism....The characters are carefully thought out. It takes a masterful writer to define a character with few words. Rick of course has the best definition of humanity. We learn by him saying 'I stick my neck out for nobody' that he is out for number one but then we learn he is a softy when he hears reason within and calls on the number '22' to aid a poor refugee and his wife. The screenwriters have a great time with this man and Humphrey Bogart played it flawlessly.It is Elsa whom is the truest of hustlers. She knows how to use her abilities as a beautiful woman to gain power but for the good side. Her character appears vulnerable and soft but cleverly disguised it is she who truly saves the day. Ingrid Bergman is radiant!Claude Rains was given great dialogue and Peter Lorre is the perfect sleaze.Filled with music and song that give the drama it's life.A marvelous production design and beautiful black and white photography accompany an incredible cast. The film is perfect. One of the great film romances of our time. Everyone is a romantic during war. It must have lifted the spirit of millions during a horrific time. Classy and sophisticated. Flawless! ****Victor Nunnally MFA Film Production and Theory BFA Dramatic History and Theory AFA Performing Experience.",10,1,2,12 June 2004
Minority Report," A Perspective about Democracy.
","A fascinating Sci-Fi Thriller about the minority perspective. In a Democracy the majority vote wins. However, what if the minority is right most of the time? Better yet, what if the minority is right when it counts most? Steven Spielberg has achieved a great philosophy in his films as his spirit merges with the art. The sad part is that film is only allowed to go so far with truly showing us what we are as consumers and human beings.Minority Report is haunting as is Truth when it appears too bright to accept. The film touches on this 'truth' as we watch the future seer suffer through a different perspective, a view that is right made wrong by the Majority.The question is: When do we listen to the Minority?It usually comes with a voice. The Nazi's were once a minority and Hitler was their voice. Yet, who was the minority along with the Nazi's? The Jew? Their voice is and always will be God.",9,4,7,17 July 2007
Citizen Kane," The Art of Classical Film-making
","Director and Star Orson Wells takes the art and technique of film-making to outstanding levels in this fictional biography of a Newspaper Tycoon Charles Foster Kane. The film is said to be a veil on the life of William Randolph Hearst, a newspaper magnate in the 1920's and 30's who was popular in politics and once interviewed Hitler but was also cited as creating loosely based stories with phony characters and deceiving the reader. Citizen Kane plays on the The True Greek Tragedy that Aristotle set in stone. A true tragedy is the fall of someone great in stature, especially if that someone was self made as is Charles Foster Kane.The Film takes us on the journey of a successful mans life, from the age of 8 to his death. Director Wells uses every film technique to capture this journey captivating the story and propelling a mans 70 year life into a 145 minute time frame. The angles and shadows crisscrossing the rooms and characters, the elapsing of time through dissolves and transitions, optical printing of lay overs in the reel, and the use of space all laid out in beautiful black and white photography. Every scene is well executed and the aging of Mr. Kane transfers off the screen in a magical way. A riddle is laid upon the viewer and it's answer is heart breaking and questionable as to what we become from who we were because we have to succeed. Beware the power of ownership. Citizen Kane is a well crafted and flawless piece of art. It is spellbinding at times and magical in its storytelling. Orson Wells had an enlightened sense to a film technique that is worth studying for filming future stories. Powerful.",10,0,1,26 March 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Spectacle indeed!
","This Sequel to last years successful Disney sea adventure The Black Pearl, has more spectacle than the first causing a muddle of a storyline. What was going on again? The stunts were spectacular. Johnny Depp's expressions were given heavy weight in close ups and his comic antics seemed overused and forced. The sea pirates are lost in their spectacular tentacle attire. It's full of these effects and cheap gimmicks and some amazing effects.The sets and locations are well shot and some of the props were fun to view. The cast seemed well adjusted and a novel warm feel of returning with the audience. How do you kill a dead person again?It is all flat somehow. A colorful sea yawning adventure.",6,2,3,16 December 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," An adventure for the whole family
","It's pure Disney.  A family fantastical adventure. That does not mean it is a good film.  It's okay.  There is plenty of spectacle and color.  Johnny Depp is fun but needs more material to work with.  He had a great character but the script held him back. Geoffrey Rush had the same problem; not enough material to explode off the screen.If you have ever been on the Disney Theme park ride Pirates of the Caribbean then you can see the spin off.  The dog holding the chains as well as the prisoners sticking their heads out the bars.  Novelty for sure.  There are some beautiful shots of the ships.  The ghost ship, The Black Pearl was beautiful to gaze upon with it's black torn sails and hull looming in the fog. The film is full of edited fight scenes using quite a few close ups.  It's all for fun and the audience seemed to enjoy the yarn.",6,0,1,4 August 2003
Hostel," Beginning Filmmakers pay heed.
","Hostel is a low budget horror film that has a gimmick. The film messes with your mind and the effect is sadness and anger. Is this what truly happens to people who are denied their wants? There is torture in the viewing experience. The film makes you want to go out and plant daisies and attend church right away. It's effect is brutally painful. If Hostel is trying to state something it is how we fall victim to desire and dwell in it damaging those we seek for temporary fulfillment. Be careful for today's pleasure can be tomorrows suffering.The film is a cess pool of lust and torture, a sadomasochist's twisted fantasy and Director Roth places you right in it. No thanks.Yet, it had a big opening weekend and has developed a semi cult following with the Bush generation. What every horror film should strive to be. so I give it 1 for that achievement.",1,2,4,11 June 2006
Billy Elliot," A film that will make you Va Clemped
","Rather Unknown 14 year old actor Jamie Bell portrays the title character, Billy Elliot. Bell carries the weight of the film on one foot. The film sets up the obvious with Billy's plight but never the less, it captures the heart and spirit of the viewer and is an inspiration to those young hopefuls who want to do more than dream.Director Stephen Daldry sets up the obstacles splendidly. He creates an environment of strife and conflict brought about by the institutions of society. Billy Elliot is about following your spirit. It suggests that we get one chance in this life to let our spirits fly. The film is set in Ireland during a coal strike that has Billy's dad and brother full of pride as they stand off against the union. Billy's grandmother symbolizes the state of mind that happens when we let that one chance of flying be taken away by the institutions.Jamie Bell dances on rooftops and in the streets without the Hollywood influence that plaqued Footloose. The film touches on individuality and the outside forces that seek to take it away. The film has tender moments of sexual identity. Billy Elliot grabs the heart from the start and does not let go even after the last shot. It is a powerful film that provokes the spirit of the viewer as well their tear ducts.",10,1,2,9 April 2006
L.A. Confidential," Classic cinema at it's finest
","L.A. Confidential is an exceptional film and perhaps the best film of the nineties. The film follows the classical style of film-making to perfection.The actors are all in top form. The story remains strong for the entire duration. The cinematography is carefully thought-out. The plot and twists, as well as the climax are all well crafted. At times, quite gripping. One low point was the very last scene. It seemed to be added on and quickly shot. Kim Bassinger was the perfect call girl. Danny Devito was the clich√É¬©d Hollywood journalist, played exact. Kevin Spacey, as always steals the scene. Crowe was the perfect angry guy with a good heart. Guy Pearce, with his nerdy goodlooks upstages them all.The film takes us back to a time when Hollywood was mainly caucasian and the racism that came with it. It takes us back to a time when conservative tough white guys made the laws. Today's generation may not remember what our country was like in the fifties and it might be best to forget but then again, Hollywood today with it's liberal attitude may not be any better but that's LA Confidential...",10,1,3,8 October 2002
Scary Movie 2," It has moments of classic toilet humor.
",Scary Movie 2 has some very funny moments but overall the film is a generic mock film. Chris Elliot's portrayal of the butler in this trivial sequel is gut splitting. Saturday Night Live would benefit with a skit using Elliot's Character. Anna Farris somehow keeps a comical sisterly approach throughout the movie. Marlon Waylan's homosexual tendencies are amusing. The cat fight has one holding back tears.There's not much going on here except mocking popular horror films. It's a light amusing film that somehow leaves you feeling good. A mindless romp through a popular formula. It works. It's stupid but good stupid.,5,4,8,26 March 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," A world of choices and decisions.
","Pan's Labyrinth has a Grimm's Fairytale quality. The mood is curious and enchanting but under a dark and stormy cloud. The time is 1944 and the Facists are taking charge in Spain. There is a monster present. He is the brutal murderous Fascist father of our young heroine. The French have a way of being so stoic to the emotions of others.A Young girl finds herself escaping into Pan's Labyrinth where she seeks to find the answer to find her true father. Her real father has developed a lust for torturing his victims in the name of his belief. His ego had blinded many as did Hitler...as does Bush.The Fantasy in the film becomes haunting and warm to the reality that surrounds this young girl. War is so destructive on so many levels yet, it will never end as long as there are politics. Imagine the young Iraqi girl escaping into her fantasies to escape the destruction around her. We're paying taxes for that people. wake up! A beautiful and lyrical film about a state of mind while we exist in this great fairy tale we were born into. Do not forget the beauty of our world. When war takes that away from the next generation, it's time to fix the war.",9,1,3,20 December 2006
Alien," A horror masterpiece
",Alien blends science fiction and horror creating one of the finest of both genres.  It's design is fabulously shot creating a claustophobic atmosphere of pure tension.  The opening silence is eerily felt.  The films pace is deliberate building up to a blow out ending. The cast seem like they walked out of Harry's bar and grill.  That's a good thing!Siqourney Weaver is oh so sexy.  Her strong jaw has the strength of ten aliens and when it drops ever so slightly we know humankind will win the war.Alien plays out like a mystery.  Like Agatha Christie's 'And Then there Were None.'  It's formula is simple: One by one until there are none. The script is simple and could have been turned into a disaster but clever and shrewd minds were at play.  H.G. Giger's Alien creation is scary.  It had to be. It's concept has been mimic and overused and has landed in Hollywoods Greatest Creations. The creation of Ashe and Ian Holmes performance must be placed in this category as well.  It was one of the greatest plot twists in cinema history. Who knew?  We knew he was odd but who thought the white milk was the essence?  The Ripley/Ashe confrontation was frightening.  The true enemy is the Earth Company. The true enemy is Politics and Business. We are all expendable.

Closer," Closer fails to convince.
","Closer opens to a silent attraction between two people; a lustful desire for sure. Natalie Portman is very alluring in the film and saves it from falling into the unknown reels of forgetful films. The problem, right from the start with this lustful attraction, is that it fails to convince. Mike Nichols direction does not work on this 21st century (turn of the century)generation x an y drama.The actors seem lost in their roles especially Roberts. She is such a powerful figure in film and should play such characters. In Closer, Roberts is given limited ability and also contradictions to her professional life. It seems unlikely that this woman of such stature would be involved with such goofiness. Not buying it.Jude Law and Clive Owen seem bored as if they are two men on a merry go round of sexual wanderings and games. However, Portman's presence is most rewarding as she seduces them all including the audience.Don't get too close with this film.",4,2,4,1 July 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," Learn from Meryl Streep what separates Fashion from clich√©.
","The Devil Wears Prada showcases two stars, Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. Mrs. Streep Portrays Miranda Preistley, CEO of Runway Magazine and a woman of refined character that has built her life using whatever it takes in the Game of life. We never truly get to know her character but see fragments of her abilities in the High Fashion world. She is a Bitch and she knows that being a Tough Bitch is the Key in making it in her Career. She is most definitely the Devil. That's if Corporate Capitalism and the dollar is the True Hades Dweller that the holy book alludes to. Miranda Priestly is beautiful and mean, shrewd and experienced...Meryl Streep is given three scenes to really showcase her acting. She defines fashion and we have her attention. Her performance as Mrs. Priestly will become a film note for sure. She is cruel but a good woman in love with power and fashion.Anne Hathaway portrays, Andrea ('Annie') a Northwestern Graduate who has landed a Job at Runway Magazine as 2nd assistant to Miranda Priestly. The Lion and the Lamb. There is an innocence emitting within Hathaway's character mostly expressed in her rosy cheeks. The transformation she goes through is expected and comes along well and is refreshing. She defines to look within oneself and see how beautiful we can become especially in the art world of fashion where individualism is expressed purely. We welcome her transformation as Hathaway is captured beautifully at times in exquisite dresses. The black dress even received recognition from envy as Annie's boyfriend unconsciously reacts to her epiphany. Annie is a confident Graduate who states; 'Well, that would not be fair.', when a High Executive advises her to quit after being shrewdly told she was a dumpy fat slob by Mrs. Priestly.The weakness in the film lies in the script. The plot is predictable and a silly subplot about a takeover distracts from the character development. It would have made a great film had the writer examined the two lead characters more where each one has something to learn from the other. It was not clear if Miranda Preistly learned anything from Annie. She never became self aware of her pompous behavior and gave in to the aspect of life that the other side was cool. Then again Thats the Devil.Annie did the job as a Northwestern Graduate would do. Perfect! She is out to prove to the world she can do anything. She walked away from the high fashion world displaying confidence and experience. She saw the ill effects of such a career as sex and corruption, betrayal and deceit, let alone the missing drug abuse would have consumed her. Her first ski lift would have taken her into that lust pool where the Devil flourish's and smiles pompously and shrewdly at her while she caves into desire. However, The film goes to fluff and remains a fun family film without getting to absorb in seriousness. Annie is the angel that showed us how to beat the Devil when she or he or it appears in our life.Love thy enemy and help them.",7,0,0,18 March 2007
Cast Away," Solitude examined
","The film takes an average citizen caught up in the fast paced world and subdues him on a tiny habital island.The primitive nature of the human comes out as we watch Tom Hanks learn how to survive without the means of comfort.Two questions arose while I viewed Cast Away. 1. What was his relationship with God?2. What about sex?I would have enjoyed these two aspects of our existence analyzed than the ones presented.  The film could be anything I suppose pending on the character stranded.  Tom Hanks, I feel represented the common suburbanite trapped in the rat race trying to survive, a man who seems to have forgotten about what it means to be alive. I would have rather seen a priest stranded or a prostitute.The film deals a lot with isolation and the need to have personal contact. I did not care too much for Tom hanks character.  He seemed bland but I guess that was the point, or was it?It was a nice touch with Helen Hunt's recognition of 'no return but can I have a hug and a deep kiss to remind me.' Then the finale at the crossroads.  Was not big on it.But the film's attempt at showing how we can begin again after a long haul in the rat race succeeds and it would be nice to see if the common man/woman seeking comfort with this world might open his or her eyes to an alternate way of thinking should their soul be dying.The film looked nice at times.  Well photographed.See 'Swept Away', an Italian film by Lina Wertmuller.  It's stranded people are more interesting to watch.",Null,0,0,13 August 2001
Armageddon," A cheap movie with high paid actors
","The movie was so expensive to make because as business goes Hollywood knew they could get away with it.  Look at the High price cast.  That is nearly 3/4 of the film's budget.Count the number of closeups given to Liv Tyler and the bland Ben Affleck. The whole picture is nearly close-ups meaning that not much of the budget was put toward anything else and we're suckers for paying admission.I know it's all for fun and for entertainment's sake but should we not as a society seek films to enlighten us.  Armageddon could have done that if it had followed a more meaningful sense of the biblical term. 
The sad part of all this is why did we have to have another meteor movie just months before and as idiotic?  It is a 'pick up off the edit room floor picture.' Just piece it together and we'll market it.Phew! I missed it on the big screen but caught it on the tube.  To imagine the money invested and this is what they give us aesthetically.Oh yea, the movie deals with a bunch of macho guys picked by a macho guy to save the world from a big comet or something like that.  Beautiful Daughter hangs at home and we watch her sob.  They know their audience and it is all good business.  Nothing wrong with that I suppose.  Perhaps I am just too sensitive.

28 Days Later...," A low budget Digital Video masterpiece
","28 days later is a perfect example of what it takes to make a lowbudget film.  It has all the ingredients.  It also displays thetechnical aspect and wonder of digital video.  A horror/science fiction film that combines an intriguing story withsome fantastic lighting.  The beauty of the movie lies mainly in it'scamera work.  The actors are strong and provide staying power. The digital quality is not perfect but due to being a 'horror' film, it isdead on.  There are moments when the director capturescharacters through windows using reflections and lighting.  It isthis imagery that constantly parades throughout the movie andproves the capability of digital video.The film is very stylish and the story is complete with a wellstructured screenplay.  We have two endings; so pay attention. Wehave one where they make it and live happily ever after and wehave one where there is no escape against 'Rage', the virus thathas a rabies type effect within 20 seconds. 'Hell' I believe wasbriefly written out only to become a 'hello'There is gore and some sexual moments.  There is a fatalisticphilosophy about our future that comes up quite often but isrebuked by hope.  The film can be an allegory on drugs if anything.  Crack and CrystalMeth. Heroin make people into zombies and make them feed offothers, not on each other.  Four stars for their efforts.  The film holds attention and captivatesthe senses.  It proves once again that a low budget horror film isthe way to go to gain capital for a more expansive film project. Thank you for giving me hope.",7,0,1,11 July 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A Top Notch Magical Tale!!
","It met my expectations highly.  A magical fantasy love story with some incredibly choreographed fight sequences using three screen presence's that stay in your mind for a long time after viewing.It is a film to talk about for days and weeks as my friends and I have repeatedly done.  The ages of people who attended the film with me ranged from 22 to 55; each one left amazed at the visual wonder they had experienced.The film is deceiving, for it begins on a weak story leaving first impressions on a lowly scale.  Yet, ten minutes into the film the chase is on and your head is filled with something purely fantastical.I would like it to win Best Picture just because it took me to another time and place; a time and place I would like to return to again and again.'The sword is okay, but I prefer the Machete'  says Michelle Yeoh.

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A well crafted Fantasy.
","I just caught it on video dubbed.  Stay away!See it with subtitles and better yet, see it on the Big Screen if you get a chance.  The film begins on weak dialogue and what appears to be a sappy story. Then, the first fight.  You're hooked!  This is a well crafted fantasy with a meaningful subtext.  What I love about this film is the focus of the characters.  They made me realize that human beings are capable of many feats.  I know we can not run up walls and leap through the air for hundreds of yards but we can become more focused on our spiritual and physical beings instead of wasting away in consumerism and thinking we are something we are not.  Nothing worse than a needless ego.It is a lovely film about love v/s independence.It is a beautiful film about selfishness v/s loyalty.When the film was over I walked away quite content and satisfied.  The story blooms like a flower.  It gets more lovely as it grows.  It is a magical enlightening film full of moments of transcending beauty. 
I loved the use of women as the warriors.  I loved Michelle Yeoh's face when confronted.  It is like she knows the secrets of life and knows, that to use your powers for the good of humankind and to remain quiet is the wiser way to go.Ah, but the rebellious youth and how they think they know so much. It will always be unless we all can agree on the best way to exist
The film is wondrous.  Again, do not, I repeat, do not see it dubbed unless you are a kid who just enjoys the fights.  There is a lot more to this film than meets the eye.

This is no police state like East Germany. It has only led to pettiness amongst the masses. Pettiness and spying go hand in hand.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," An enjoyable eccentric story
","About an enjoyable eccentric chap named Willy Wonka played wondrously by Johnny Depp. The changes made from the first Willy Wonka back in 1972 are well accepted. The oompa's seem less frightening and their riddled songs are less punishing. Err is to be human.Unlike the God complex of Willy Wonka, Charlie and The Chocolate factory aims more for the effects of an oppressive childhood. Depp's resemblance to Michael Jackson is too coincidental for it to be a Make Up Artist's inspiration. Willy is a good guy and unconventional, living a reclusive life within a wondrous and magical Chocolate Factory. He learned the art of entrepreneurship and grew wealthy as he mentally remained a child. Oh those youthful pains that plague the soul for eternity. Like trick or treating we must learn to get over it and lean to your family who have always known your child spirit, to remind you to get over it.Charlie is the key to freeing Wonka's inner child and stepping outside the box.

The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight and a Marketing Quest.
","The Dark Knight's marketing campaign was very luring and the super charged trailers for this multi produced dark and monotone film were done very well, tempting the moviegoer's curiosity. The film starts off on a somewhat implausible crime and an introduction to the evil that Batman will have to face. Gotham is in trouble. It seems that since the 911 attacks several films have been portraying destruction and violence in a form of terrorism. The Dark Knight has a parable to the current terror that the Western World is facing and fighting against. The Joker, Batman's antagonist in the film is the symbol for this new terrorism...he is a disturbing character that is faced with impossible feats of terror. The film jolts the senses and keeps the consciousness focused on defeating this terror and how but, the impossible meets the impossible and a reminder that this all comic book fun with a little propaganda involved. It's the hero's journey done all over again. Cinematographer Wally Pfister's lighting is the best part of this hyped film. Heath Ledger played a great Character Role that has been played well in the past. Chistian Bale seemed bored and tired or perhaps that was his Character as batman would be tired and bored with existence and wondering why he is bothering when the cops in the film are portrayed as mediocre, corrupt, stupid...why would Batman continue...Rich, successful, powerful, superhero, attractive...The Dark Knight is full of questionable feats and watching the editing in places did not convince that what just occurred on film is too hard to accept even on comic book level. This empty and sad film leaves the senses the moment the car door shuts. Like a rickety roller-coaster...glad to see the credits role.",5,7,17,19 August 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Where is love?
","Every so often the consciousness shifts. Stanley Kubrick's metaphorical and lyrical 2001, A Space Odyssey based on the novel by Arthur C. Clarke captures this shift, suggesting the presence of a universal force that controls our fate and shapes our consciousness.The Film opens on our ancestors in a primitive and animalistic state. When does the Dawn of Man occur and when will it evolve to the next level? A Neanderthal tosses a bone into the sky spinning as we are taken to a twirling space station ten thousand years later. We see one step into evolution.2001 is a spectacular film with a flowing composition of eccentric shots that keep us glued to a mystery around a Monolith that appears on the Moon and once appeared at the dawn of man. A Perfect Structure leading the consciouness to a better place. The most human of all the characters is an on board Computer named HAL2000...as the Monolith aims to make Man greater...Man aims to make the Computer greater...yet HAL can not compute Love when it strikes his hard drive...the love generated by the Monolith for Mankind.2001, A Space Odyssey fills the senses with wonder. It is dreamlike and seducing. The cinematography beautifully cascades off the screen. The film is eerie at times and scary as space seems to lonely and cold. Where is technology and science leading us and do we need to go there? Is it time for the next shift of consciousness?",10,0,1,29 July 2001
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An exploration of time and human emotion.
","Eternal Sunshine is a cleverly crafted film put together by an entourage of gifted artists. The script is superb. The film contains the element of memory, an item that has been popular in films since the wonderous Memento put it to good use.  What if you could erase someone out of your life and have no recollection of any events, thoughts, ideas, epiphanies, love, spite, anger, revenge... foregiveness...? Sounds absurd? The film tries to make us believe that some people would risk an unsafe 'unwarranted' brain scanner to probe areas of their mind...manipulating time and emotion. Somehow, it works.  There is a marvel to the idea and the film pulls off a unique exploration of it as we walk at times through the mind of Carrey and yearn for him to beat the system and save his only happiness, Kate Winslet who reacts terrifically to Carrey's dopish goofiness.The two main characters are loners-losers displaced amongst society's structure yet managing to cope and survive in tight surroundings.  They are uneducated and have no structure.  They bring each other happiness in a brief period of time and their inner demons tear them apart leaving them bitter. Unable to cope they both seek removal of each other from their memories.How they paid for this complicated procedure one has to wonder. Winslet has forgotten him but Carrey is hanging on to his memories and running with Winslet through the passages of his mind and emotions. It touches the heart. There is something wicked under the surface.  The manipulation of time and emotion by the hand of man can be a very dangerous act.  The characters contributing to the act are also displaced yet educated. Their lack of ethics was appauling and might be allegorical to certain ethics in science today. Within their circle lies nasty secrets and suddenly their is an evil present and that is the manipulation of time and emotion.
Eternal Sunshine dealt with quite a number of relationship issues, most of them petty little nags that in consistent display can lead to contempt. All they needed was a break and if they wanted their memories erased why not just erase the bad ones.  There is good feeling in the end but do not let the truth get smothered by the facade.This is a wonderful film. Intriguing and refreshing. ****",9,0,1,22 March 2004

","I was not a big fan of the first one. However, when I saw the trailer for the sequel I was enticed.  I am now not a big fan of the sequel.  It showed so much promise with its spectacled scenes.  The characters are comical and a wee bit Spielburgian.  The film is fun for the most part and the array of creatures that pop up here and there are an animators delight. 
But, the film crashes toward the end.  It was as if the writer was replaced at the end and they brought someone in to create an a quick finale. 
The film sets up for battles we can not wait to see only to be disappointed after they are fought.  I was excited to see the rematch between the two female leads but what a downer.  It is neat to compare a filmed fight such as the one in 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' to this one.  One can see how one director is superior to the other.  The Mummy's fight scenes are noticeably computer enhanced whereas the weapon fight between the 'Tiger/Dragon's' women is beautifully shot and choreographed.  The same direction is needed for a film of such grandeur.
When the Pharaoh loses his powers all of the sudden I felt cheated.  The Scorpion King was weak along with the silly battle with Frasier.  However, if I were a kid I would thoroughly enjoy this movie.Perhaps Ang Lee could direct the third installment.",Null,0,0,8 October 2001
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," What is the Magic of Harry Potter?
","J.K. Knowlings, author of the Potter series has created an unlikely hero. Harry Potter, an awkward boy with glasses who possesses a powerful spirit. He possesses courage, stamina, logic, sensibility, patience, love and wisdom. He also possesses hate caused by Lord Voldemort, the person responsible for the death of Harry's Parents when he was a baby. Our hero Harry Potter possesses one more trait: He is a Wizard.Harry Potter and The Goblet Of Fire is the Fourth installment of the Knowling series. The young wizards, Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are back for their fourth year at Hogwarts, the Wizard School located somewhere between time and dimension. The school is an incredible Castle on a mountainside surrounded by snowy peaks and green forests and a tranquil lake. Within Hogwarts interior we meet the familiar cast of Wizards, Witches, Creatures, and returning students. It is a colorful and entertaining cast.Harry finds himself selected by the Goblet Of Fire as an underage competitor in a dangerous multi-wizardry school competition known as the Tri Wizard Tournament in which student representatives from three different sorcery schools compete in a series of increasingly challenging contests. The tournament is to be held at Hogwarts. Harry must fend off accusations of tampering with the Goblet of Fire. The School's Top Wizards are concerned for Harry and suspicious of him as well. New characters emerge throughout the film including Alastor 'MadEye' Moody who is the new Professor of the Dark Arts.Harry, Ron, and Hermione are now 14 and experiencing the hormonal changes taking place. Puberty brings with it many dark forces that all teenagers must battle as they try to make it through school and life. The Goblet Of Fire has an allegorical tone of using the dark forces of Puberty. The Dragons that come at you during those confusing years are powerful but must be faced just as Harry battles his fire breather in one of the tournaments challenges.British Director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and A Funeral, Enchanted April, Donnie Brasco) takes on the Potter series and rises above the call of duty. He creates some beautiful visuals, including a silhouetted shot of the young wizards running along a hillside in the beginning of the film. It was a sure sign that the film was going to be a pleasure to watch.The entire cast flows from one to the other and seem comfortable in their roles. Daniel Radcliffe portrays Harry Potter a bit rigid and always wears the same look of wonder on his face whenever he enters anywhere new. He has been at Hogwarts for four years, one would think he would have developed a bit more culture. His character is still young and vulnerable but the Goblet of Fire has chosen Harry's name and he now must act.Albus Dumbledore, the Head Wizard of Hogwarts says to Harry: 'Dark and difficult times lie ahead, Harry. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right... and what is easy. 'The Magic Of Harry Potter is that he is you and I at our finest.Rated PG 13 for violence and mature themes.",8,1,2,20 November 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," An MTV cheez wiz of a sequel.
","The problem I had with this whole mess of a film is that it lacked the style of the first Matrix.  It lacked the innovation and the awe that made the first one so impressionable.  The Zion population was a poor creation.  Everybody is fit and erotic with a gypsy spirit who dance sexually when it's time to celebrate.  It was like one of those young pop diva MTV videos.  In fact, the whole film played out like separate videos with  circuit music rhythm's.  Oh boy, it must be another fight scene coming!  The entrance into Zion was fun along with many of the computer generated images. (reminding me why I'm afraid of computers; how can we believe anything anymore?) The opening dream sequence told me that I was going to have a bad experience with it's jerky opening and sloppy slow motion tactics.  It was too formulaic and lazy.  But hey, everyone made a lot of money.  That's what it's all about.Come on people! Substance and beauty.",5,0,0,21 May 2003
War of the Worlds," A Medicocre Retelling of an 1898 classic Novel.
","H.G. Wells classic Science Fiction Novel, War of The Worlds was written in 1898. Well's descriptions of alien weaponry has an eerie comparison to nuclear energy. The world that was attacking was the future of the Human Race. If anything, the Tripods in Spielberg's spin off, represent Globalization from Tomorrow.Spielberg's War of The Worlds begins on a sunny morning. Then all hell breaks lose. The special effect imagery of the approaching aliens is eagerly felt with the dark menacing clouds and huge bolts of lightening. It feels like it is going to be a fun ride...It's not. The film hits a sensibility speed bump and goes out of control never finding a place to rest. It is a wonder how it got passed the screening room.",5,0,0,26 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," No attachment.
","It is unsettling viewing all three of the latest Star War series due solely to the monotone acting. There is nothing to learn here and the world would have been better off not seeing the History of the first Star Wars until someone came along that knew how to Direct, cast and write. Lucas appears to be a Vain and egotistical director that has not left his 'cool state' of being he had in his twenties.Natalie Portman's purpose in this film was disheartening because giggles and snickers was the reaction to most of her one dimensional lines. Haydn Christensen replies were of equal weight.The film opens on flowing eye candy images that dazzle the senses. The one problem that has occurred in all the films since 1977 is that there are so many lasers shooting about. Lasers abound in 'Sith's' opening. It is so preposterous! Not to speak of the landing of the split in half Star Destroyer.The Wookie Battle was a let down as they all hollered at the sky and did nothing else. Anecdotes from R2 and C3PO failed to rise any humor.The scariest part of The Return of The Sith is that Yoda had more character than the actors. A computer generated character. He could have carried the weight of the film along with Mcgregor who at times seem to force himself from laughing at his own lines.The Bad guys have the most fun. The Emperor is a marvelous creation. The transformation to the Dark Side was sophomoric for Darth Vader. The change happened to quickly and seemed unlikely. The Hades Inferno played out like a video game where one thinks how a human can survive in such heat let alone the giant flying insects. Darth Vaders pre disfigurement was ill felt and set the stage for eternal bitterness.The Dark Side definitely won this battle.",6,1,4,23 May 2005
WALL¬∑E," An Early 21st Century Animated Feature
","WALL-E captivates the senses during the first 20 minutes as computer generated images of our future look and feel life like. A loneliness creeps in and engulfs the mind as WALL-E wheels his way around a decaying metropolis, in silence doing his job as a scrap recycler constructor. Many films in recent times have applied the spirit and machine together such as A.I., I Robot, 2001, and Aaron Lipstadt's obscure 1982 film Android. There may be a future in robotics as the Human population rises and our needs change. Investors look out.This Pixar/ Disney production is a wonder to view as we watch WALL-E pursue companionship in a space visitor, a Droid Robot named EVA sent to the barren earth to find plant life. The arrival of the spaceship as it descends upon the desolate city is beautiful and enjoyably felt. There is a Genesis feel to EVA's arrival as she represents Eve in the Garden and WALL-E is Adam. God even saw in a robot, loneliness. The discovered plant represents the fig leaf and the space ship is the Ark. Disney and Christianity have always been hand in hand.The second half of the film becomes more Disney as we meet the Inhabitants on the Spaceship. A sadness may come upon the mind as the inhabitants are a future generation of WALL-Mart consumers continuing the game deep in Space. The Earth was gobbled up and left a wasteland by corporate consumers apathetic to the world around them. Who will lead them without ego back to earth. WALL-E? No. Love. Just as Christ represents love. Disney takes the same old story and paints another unique and original piece of art.WALL-E seems to be telling us that the human race needs to come together and hold hands and save this planet. It aims at the next generation, today's 5 to 10 year olds who will always have the future of our planet on their minds.WALL-E is fun, entertaining, unusual, alarming and contains some amazing images of a computer generated reality. That right there is frightening as the same generation may be deceived in the future when they think they are looking at something real when its just Pixar tricking the consumer into consumption.",9,3,6,2 July 2008
Shrek," Think about it!

Signs," A despondent film with monotone dialogue and emotion
","M. Night Shyamalan's SIGNS is plagued, as was his predecessor, The Sixth Sense with an X-file like mood. Scully and Mulder had to be searching that corn field. Emotions lie low in this despondent film. Let's face it, Shyamalan has a gimmick and it seems to work well with Bourgeois audiences. The film is very goofy on the most part. The film holds our curiosity but fails to deliver any punch.  It seems to be dwelling on some philosophical idea of the human condition in the 21st century. It explores the faith and family of rural America in a quick changing world.  A corn raised family residing in an Andrew Wyeth painting.The directing and lighting in the film fail to inspire any originality.  It leaves one to believe that Shyamalan was under contract to make another film; 'Oh, who cares...give them cheap alien gimmicks and a corn field....we'll get you Tom Cruise or Mel Gibson....it will make millions...'And it did....",5,1,1,14 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Allegorical on today's Muslim/Christian Terrorism/America acts
","Enchanting and romantic. The trilogy is beautifully told.  The shots were epic and the Tolkien fantasy books brought to film is a cinema fan's dream. I dare to tread on the ground of praises for it's consistent battles and obstacles and argue that they were sometimes sequenced too close together causing the mind to overload. I grew bored but remained dazzled.  It seemed at most; a fun colorful fantasy roller coaster ride.To destroy a ring. The film comes just in time while America is war with Iraq.  The film displays heroism for your freedom and patriotism for your land. It is a mix of cultures coming together to destroy an evil; A unified monster society of anarchy serving no purpose but to please a dictator; an evil that wishes to rid of cultures. It seems allegorical to the present day. The eagles flying in to attack the dragons seemed a bit symbolic of America coming in to save the day. The ring represents, possibly oil, or better yet nuclear weapons.  It is the Holy Grail; who possesses it is in charge. Their is the Christian/Muslim war as well.  It doesn't look good for the Muslim's...or does it. Spun from the Islamic world comes terrorism. Cultures will defeat this enemy. Freedom will prevail and your dragons will no longer control your people. But who funded terrorism? Cultures exist within the Islamic world as well and they possess the simple pleasures within certain boundaries; pleasures of enlightenment, as did the tribes of the Fellowship. The film could be argued either way as to who the Fellowship represents but it definitely possesses an element of present day events.
The Western culture lives in fantasy land. It's ports are filled with wine and drugs. Drink of thy cup.  The Dragons could be Terrorists or they could be Corporations trying to suffocate cultures.  Globalization.
It will be the Hobbits of either side; our sons and daughters of Bourgeois decadence or the children of destitute nations. The film and books play out like a prophecy as does the Bible and Torah.  In the end is the big battle. It will be a big one.Perhaps it is all just fantasy and no matter the place or time there will always be war as long as there are politics.The film asks; live like the Hobbits; Self Sufficiency.  No civilization has lasted and none ever will.Here's to the one who destroys the ring.",Null,0,0,8 January 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Fantastic Space Adventure with Colorful Characters.
","Star Wars is filled with so much imagination. It is a child's fantasy of monsters and ghouls as well as princesses and knights. The characters are impressive from the Black Dark Knight, Darth Vader to the bear yelling Furry Chewbacca. It is a ride in space. The film lifts you along as if a long time ago this did happen.The film's edgy editing actually works for some reason. It is film about the dark side of life and the light side of life. Who will prevail? It will be an eternal war with those two.The images with C3PO and R2d2 in the desert were beautiful and felt far away in a land somewhere else. Then the black hooded dwarfs appear with their menacing red glowing eyes. Fun! Darth Vaders entrance is well captured.Carrie Fisher breaths life into Princess Leia. Harrison Ford is the fun free spirited captain of the fastest piece of junk in space. Mark Hamill plays Luke Skywalker with a natural boyish look of amazement. Alec Guiness is mystical as Obi Wan Kenobi. The Death Star is luminous.The story is a classic example of a Protagonist's journey. There is a quest and there is the journey to that quest with the obstacles in the way.The Empire Strikes Back takes the series to a whole new level and continues to dazzle the senses. The Return of The Jedi matures into a beautiful film ending the generational attachment.It's difficult to understand what happened to the latest Star War films. It's as if to say that we grew into one dimensional beings. Lucas should have went back to the technology used on the first films to shoot the latest trilogy. It would have had continuity.",10,0,0,2 April 2006
Gladiator," Eye Candy for the Bored
","A visual delight indeed. This film appears to be a facetious attempt toward Hollywood and the 21st century moviegoer.  It is a true mess of celluloid. While the film possesses a visual charm, it tends to stray in to an array of images that leave the senses feeling sick.  It is a difficult film to watch because so much resides on imagery than on historical importance.  Yes, it has action, suspense,and beautiful people to look upon (and some ugly) yet, it is forgettable.  Scott seems like he lost control of the picture and I don't blame him for the script is so one dimensional and portrayed by the actors on such a corny level-what is one to do?  Well, a smart director would give Hollywood and the comfortably numb what they want, A mindless romp through the Roman Empire using high tech imagery and pop celtic/fantasy music to leave us agasped.  This is what we get for the money spent? The pop culture eats it up while the higher culture sulks in it's humility for buying a ticket.",Null,0,0,16 June 2000
Contact," A poetic and philosophical journey of science and faith.
","Contact is a well crafted film that is able to penetrate our sensibilities about the unknown. Are we alone in this great mass of space? Jodie Foster Plays the lead character Ellie Arroway with ferocity and rationality, an enigmatic woman of intrigue and beauty. The spiritual and poetic opening to Contact, with it's sound to silence pull out to the distance universe penetrates the senses.The film tries to remain serious with it's 'Contact'. The script throws in theology, pessimism, optimism, fear, progress, and wonder with great effect. There is a small love story in the sub plot and it fits best low lying. Director Zemeckis does a terrific job at building suspense and intrigue into the deciphering Ellie's discovery. There is political and religious debate as well as ego grabbers in this discovery.The special effects are beautiful and well crafted. It is a handsome film to ponder and discuss.",9,1,3,25 March 2006
Donnie Darko," A Beautiful Manipulation of Destiny.
","There is something beautiful going on in Donnie Darko but it remains below the surface. It is the idea that we can walk through God's portal. To be able to transport ourselves back and forth within in our own destiny. Donnie Darko has figured it out or is he schizophrenic? A highly original film that leaves the senses spellbound. Then again, Donnie Darko also leaves the sense that we have just been had by a highly intellectual bored teenager.Donnie Darko is somewhat of a genius. He knows things that other students his age do not concern themselves with. That is because he has lived this moment in time repeatedly trying to spend every moment with the girl he loves and how he can save her life. He tries to evade destiny by making things right but because of his wants he takes Frank the Rabbit into the wormhole with him. Donnie shoots Frank in the eye killing him therefore, because of Darko's manipulation of time Frank's life was vainly taken. Donnie Darko has to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to restore normalcy. His schizophrenia comes from his manipulation of time. Frank is Donnie's Dark Conscious.The film is a true mess of a puzzle. Still looking for the missing pieces. However, the film possesses a unique feel. There is marvel at it's ideas that hold curiosity till the end. The characters are terrifically developed in 80's persona. Why 1988? Was it an end of an era. An end to the 80's ideals. Pre-Internet? The beginning of George Bush and his Global New Order? The world has changed. If we can find a wormhole and go back in time perhaps we can change destiny but someone is going to have to die. It all falls to self sacrifice to save the world.The film has a great soundtrack with haunting lyrics of 80's new wave alternative. Producer, Drew Barrymore showcases a refreshing presence. 'cellar door, the most beautiful phrase in the English language' Patrick Swayze does a superb job as a self help pervert. Jake Gyllenhaal displays the awkwardness of teenage confusion very well. In a way we all have walked in God's portal as we enter a world of confusion and madness, of love and hate,...it's a mad mad world. Love it!",10,0,0,28 January 2004
V for Vendetta," A Romanic View of an Individual verses Government
","James McTeigue directed V for Vendetta, a film about an individual who is brave enough to stand up against the oppressive new global government. Surveillance cameras are everywhere therefore, having a good time is forbidden unless permitted. V for Vendetta is produced in a time where the 21st generation is questioning 9-11. Was it someone trying to get personal revenge on the Western Government or someone trying to get revenge for deceiving society, yet let them believe that they are living in comfort? Was it over opium? I mean pharmaceuticals... V for Vendetta is produced during the Bush Administration Era: 2000-2008. Bush's reign produced the Iraqi War to help rid the world of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Osama Bin Ladin laid claim as the leader of Al Queda to the destruction of The World Trade Center. Only if there were fire works when the jets smashed into the Two Towers.V is a graphic novel brought to screen. It's entertaining as it reminds us of past dictatorships based on an ideology. The Government of America wants to convince the world of Globalization and prosperity for the individual. It is a destructive and evil nature to seek, for it makes the individual spiteful of their plights.Natalie Portman is an attractive female caught up in the world of V, the individual for freedom. The film romanticizes terrorism, as if it is a cause to philosophize about. Who are these terrorists anyway? It's so vague isn't it? Maybe the truth is hard for a comfortable nation. It was for Germany as they ignored a holocaust.Too bad the intellect of the individual is not examined. V for Vendetta is a bourgeoisie chat fest over a few drinks and a joint. The film tries to convince that it knows a deeper secret, yet it fails to convince. 9/11 was a serious attempt at telling us that we need to see the whole and step outside the box. V for Vendetta is helping us see beyond the walls, it wants us to suffer for the consequences of capitalism, a world void of feeling. What's the purpose of history?",7,1,3,6 August 2006
