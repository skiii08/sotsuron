The Devil's Advocate," Ever notice how all the pans are 'Anonymous'?
",I've looked at both movies I liked and those I didnt. And I can't recall any from Anonymous that LIKED the film in question.  And those that didn't like the movie I didnt like didnt seem to have really watched it.What does that tell us? Where's the strength of conviction?  Why can't they identify themselves.Anyone that didnt appreciate the art that went into this film either have no taste.. or they're yanking our chains.Jim Armstrong,Null,0,1,8 April 2000
Fight Club," To h*ll with the critics..
","This movie is about what happens when we find our lives devoid of purpose and meaning.. and even challenges.And, screw Nietsche!  You don't have to be a Soc or Psyche major to understand it.  You only have to live through a few disappointments in life.In fact, I didnt even find the violence to be all that graphic.  We are raising a society of weinies, folks and sooner or later there's gonna be an explosion.  It happens today.. what do you REALLY think motivates all the mindless violence and drive-by's.  It's the search for the catharsis of survival in a to-the-brink combat.These guys just want to feel alive.",Null,0,1,20 March 2001
American Pie," The way it REALLY was (and hopefully sometimes IS)!
","There have been several comments by older folks here about the quality of this flick and I'll whole-heartedly add my 50-ish kudos.This was ALSO the way it was in the sixties - some folks conveniently seem to forget this:  The sexual revolution started in high school.I expected to see something along the lines of the embarrassingly exploitive 'Porky's' or unfocused as 'Ridgemont..' or even too much of the existentialism of 'Breakfast Club'. Think of 'American Graffiti' from a different angle. With as much fun as 'Ferris Bueller'What we found was that ALL the characters in the movie were multi-dimensional even the girls who usually suffer from the cardboard sex-object treatment in these things.Anyone that doesnt think this movie is representational and realistic -yes, even the gross-outs- is suffering from denial or delusions. .. And sorry to tell you kids, you didnt invent this sexual angst.As say the rest.. dont see it with a stranger but with a good friend, you'll leave laughing.Why, 'One time... at Band Camp......'",Null,0,0,2 September 1999
The Green Mile," Tells us a lot..
",".. I'm always bemused by the 'user' comments on IMDB.  They tell you as much about the folks that make them as if you were in Group analysis with them for months. Cynicism, self-esteem problems, shallowness and self-centeredness are all revealed. Let's address some: 'unbelievable plot (supernatural)' DUH!  This IS a Stephen King story!'I Knew the ending after...'  once again, after you read a  few King novels, you learn to see where he's going; it's HOW YOU GET THERE, DUMMY!'This movie scared me'  voices of the Titmice that want to pretend and actually WISH that the world was full of Pollyanna's like themselves.  News: There's a few budding Hitler's Stalin's, Amin's, that agree with you so they can herd you lemmings into their own sea.A film is a film, a movie a movie.. what's important is that it entertain, amaze and instruct.  Green Mile does that.  It also helps you understand people.. none are all good, none are all bad, but some come very close to the edge.Summary: If you liked 'A Clockwork Orange', Any VanDamme movie, or 'The Letter', you'll probably hate this.  Get my drift?",Null,0,0,30 December 2000
Back to the Future," THE Quintessential MOVIE!!!
","This is NOT one of the greatest films ever made, but it will STAND THE TEST OF TIME as >>one of the GREATEST MOVIES ever<<!This film should be part of any film school study as a perfect example on how to make a successful commercial film.Premise: (familiar concept but original plot that appeals to the imagination) Production Values: (Clean cutting and pace without distraction, no unnecessary SFX) Direction: Let the Actors GO! Casting: (Totally believe the characters, including typecasting eg; Lloyd, Fox) Script: Settings, set design, continuity, multi-level historical references using ESTABLISHED pop-culture icons Music, Soundtrack: Great selection. Return on Post production publicity.Little appreciated career effects: Fox and Lloyd were already celebrities, but this movie REALLY sprang Lea Thompson's career.  She, more than any other cast member, had the greatest range of character in the series.  She played 3 separate characters, I believe.  She went on to several  different film roles as a result of her classical theatrical performances, then Caroline in the City. Now (Spring, '00) she has been cast as a lead in a resuscitation of 'Cabaret' for the stage.  I can't help but think this role helped in her selection based on her ability to project character.Overall, this will rank right up there with Breakfast Club as an example of '80s ensemble flicks.  But, unlike B.C., will never be tiring to watch over and over.",9,0,1,5 June 2000
