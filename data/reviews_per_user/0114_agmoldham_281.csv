Ford v Ferrari," Thrilling Movie
",There seem to have been a lot of movies in 2019 based on factual events. This movie looks at Ford motor company's attempt to conquer the motor racing awards in the 1960's. The company was in need of some good PR in order to restore it's reputation. As with all fact based movies you are always left wondering which parts are true and which are artistic license.The movie tells the story of how the Ford team try to beat the all powerful Ferrari team. Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby who heads up the team. His friend and lead driver is the rather unlikable Ken Miles played by Christian Bale. I've always been a big fan of Christian Bale and he's on form again here.This is a great racing movie and well worth a watch.,7,2,5,21 November 2019
The King's Speech," A joy.
","The King's Speech is the first film I have seen in 2011 and it will almost certainly be the film I enjoy most this year.The film tells the story of the Duke of York (Colin Firth) who is second in line to the throne and suffering from a terrible stutter. The family name for the Duke is Bertie. He has tried many different Doctors in an effort to cure the stutter, but none have been able to help. Ultimately the Duke of York becomes King George VI after the abdication of Edward VIII. In the new era of Radio it is vital that the King can communicate with the people so the stutter is like torture to the King whenever he is required to speak publicly. His wife Elizabeth (Helen Bonham Carter) introduces Bertie to a failed Australian actor Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) who has turned to speech therapy.Logue has an unusual approach to speech therapy and it seems the relationship is doomed to failure. Bertie gives up on a number of occasions, but seems convinced that Logue may actually be helping him.The film is delightful throughout although there is quite a lot of swearing which may rankle for those people who do not like bad language. It is always very lighthearted and you completely warm to all the main characters. The scenes between Firth and Rush are mesmerising and it seems very likely that they may be in line for Oscar recognition. The film is beautifully filmed and excellently directed by Tom Hooper who also directed The Damned United which was also excellent.Not one for the adrenalin junkies, but a joy for everyone else!",9,1,3,9 January 2011
Despicable Me 2," Fairly entertaining
","Having seen a trailer for Despicable Me 2 I was quite looking forward to watching the movie. Most animated films are aimed at adults as well as children and DM2 is no exception although the focus is probably more towards the children. I saw the 3d version of the film and there are some scenes which were undoubtedly better in 3d. The end credits are a particular example.The storyline revolves around Gru a retired crook being hired by the anti villain league and being paired with the rather pretty Lucy. They investigate a crime and the movie is always watchable, but never quite memorable. Overall pretty entertaining and sure kids will love it.",5,1,4,16 July 2013
The Avengers," Not my type of film
","I must confess that I'm not really a massive fan of the comic book movies. I don't normally go and see them at the cinema, but someone dragged me along to watch Avengers Assemble.The plot is predictably simple with an alien enemy threatening security on earth. This means that a team of superheroes are required to defeat the enemy. The superheroes that are recruited include Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye and the Black Widow. The thing that I disliked about the film is the fact that I didn't really care whether any of the characters survived or perished. There are plenty of funny one-liners in the style of the Bond one-liners. It also appears that the actors had a good time making the film. Scarlett Johansson looks particularly good in a cat-suit throughout the movie. The guy that dragged me along to the movie absolutely adored the film, so if you are into comic book movies I'm sure you'll have a blast.",3,4,23,13 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," Better than original
",The Original Blade Runner movie is one of my most watched movies. I've probably watched it well over 20 times. You may be expecting me to go into a gushing critique about why Blade Runner is so good. The truth is that I never quite got it even though it should have been one of my favourite movies based on other peoples analysis.Forward 35 years and along comes Blade Runner 2049. For fans of the original movie the good news is that it has a very similar feel to the first movie. The story is very much the same with the main focus of the film being a blade runner K (Ryan Gosling) who is tracking down and retiring replicants. The movie is well acted and personally I found it slightly more satisfying than the original. Something tells me that I will be in the minority with that view though. Well worth a watch and sure to be one of the movies that 2017 is remembered for.,5,1,13,10 November 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," It could have been a classic film
","It seems that a lot of people on imdb consider Tarantino to be the greatest director of all time. As such, I'm sure that this film will shoot into many peoples top 10's along with Vol 1, Dogs and Fiction. I myself find his work increasingly indulgent although Vol 2 suffers slightly less from this than Vol 1.Overall Vol 2 is better than Vol 1, which isn't really surprising since Vol 1 didn't really have a conclusion. I think if the two films were edited down to a single feature running about 135 minutes we could have a real classic film. This is the 'Special Edition' I would like to see released.Anyway Vol 2 has a few of the trademark Tarantino dialogues and David Carradine steels the acting honours. Uma Thurman also puts in a good performance in the lead. Although it does drag slightly at times there's always a good scene that arrives just in time to save the day. 7/10.",5,0,1,25 April 2004
First Man," Understated like Neil Armstrong himself
",It's a little hard to give spoilers away for First Man as most people on the planet will be aware of the history. In addition to the story behind the first man on the moon the movie focuses on the strains it puts on Armstrong's home life.Gosling and Foy are very believable in the roles of Neil and Janet Armstrong. It seems very strange in today's celebrity world that Neil Armstrong could be so anonymous after his exploits. The movie gives us an insight into the man and some of the events portrayed will cause me to go and check for accuracy. The pressure it put on his already difficult home life was immense. It is quite a comparison between achieving one of the most momentous things in history whilst doing the dishes.The movie also makes you realize just how amazing an achievement it was. The risks of failure must have been incredibly high and there is no doubt that all the astronauts were incredibly brave. Some of the launch sequences in particular are jaw dropping.,6,0,1,24 November 2018
Black Swan," Thrilling finale
","I didn't really know what to expect from the Black Swan. I found the opening of the film somewhat slow, but it built into a fantastic emotional finale. I have always found Natalie Portman to be a fine actress and her (wooden) performances in the Star Wars trilogy can only be down to George Lucas' direction. She is in fine form in the Black Swan and plays a starlet who is seeking the lead part in Swan Lake. Whilst she has no problems playing the white swan the black swan poses more of a problem.It seems Portman is a shoe in for the Best Actress award at the Oscars. She is well supported by the cast which includes Winona Ryder and Barbara Hershey. The film isn't for the feint hearted and is very challenging. The first hour of the film is OK, but the last 30 minutes are brilliant!",6,0,2,26 January 2011
Changeling," A fine movie - but a tough watch
","This is the latest movie from Clint Eastwood and it's fair to say that it's a showcase for a director who's at the top of his game. One of the trademarks of Eastwood is the slow delivery, but this shouldn't be confused with a movie that is boring. The pace of the movie gives you time to empathise with the characters and consider the events that are unfolding.I don't know how well known this story is in America, but it isn't something I was familiar with. I'm not sure how much artistic license was taken, but it is based on the true story of a 1928 child abduction in LA. Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins who is the unfortunate Mother. I watched the story unfold with amazement as the trials and tribulations of Christine are played out on the big screen. This is a fine performance by Jolie although I think it's also fair to say that this must have been a fairly prized role for actresses around the world. I for one certainly wouldn't be surprised if she nabs the Oscar for it.The film is quite a tough watch at times and there's very little feel good factor. Probably not for the adrenalin junkies or a first date, but a great film for those who love character based films or real life tales. Definitely one of the top movies of 2008.",8,6,10,4 December 2008
Frost_Nixon," Well crafted movie
",This film is based on the period after Nixon resigned the US presidency. It follows the run up to his interview by David Frost who was a fairly average talk show host anywhere in the world that he could hold down a job. All the major US TV networks wanted the interview for themselves and did not take kindly to Frost landing the job mainly through his own enterprise.The film is a classic battle of David and Golliath. Personally I love the verbal battle between characters more than physical battles and anyone of the same opinion should love the film. If you need a fix of action from your movies you are probably well advised to skip this.Frank Langella is brilliant as Nixon and Sheen isn't overshadowed either as Frost. There are a number of elements to the film that are open to interpretation and I'm not as convinced about the main conclusion of the 'victor' of the interview as I was before seeing it. Ron Howard also does a reasonable job and it's always interesting to spot which role his brother will land.,7,0,1,12 February 2009
Walk the Line," Great Entertainment
",Walk the Line is the story of Johnny Cash. There's a strong focus on the relationship between Cash and June Carter. I wasn't really aware about their story prior to the movie and I did wonder how Carter was wearing so well bearing in mind Cash used to listen to her music as a child. A bit of research since watching the movie reveals she was a child star! The two central performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon are excellent and well worthy of their respective nominations by the academy. I expect Witherspoon may well walk away with the gong. As with most good bio pics based on musicians the real highlight of the film is the music and I've no doubt the music of Cash will see a revival as a result of the film. It's a cross between country and rock n roll and the film really captures the spirit of the 50's. Highly recommended.,7,0,0,5 February 2006
Mission: Impossible III," The best MI movie
","I can't say I really rated the first two Mission Impossible movies and the only thing I can remember about them was the ludicrous Helicopter Channel Tunnel scene.I therefore didn't really have very high expectations for the third instalment and I probably wouldn't even have seen it but for a few positive critical reviews. I'm therefore pleased to report that this was a big improvement on the first two movies and actually contains a few characters that are interesting. The main plot revolves around the relationship between Ethan and Julia who isn't involved with the MI team. this is played quite well and Hoffman hams up the bad guy quite nicely making it a fun couple of hours.In a few years time I probably will not remember much about this movie either, but I'll probably remember the main plot line rather than a ropey stunt. Pretty Good.",5,0,1,26 May 2006
Requiem for a Dream," An education in addiction
","For some reason I did not catch this movie during it's theatrical release. Through word of mouth I have now watched it, and it certainly is a fine movie. The subject matter will not be everybody's cup of tea, but for those people who enjoy a serious movie it will certainly prove very thought provoking.The movie follows four characters; widow Sara (Burstyn) her son Harry (Leto), his girlfriend Marion(Connelly) and his friend Tyrone(Wayans). Set over a year the film follows the characters increasing addictions. I'm sure a lot of the conservatives would write off this film due to the subject matter, but it's a better warning about the consequences of drug taking than most official warnings. Whilst not detracting from anybody else in the cast, Burstyn is absolutely outstanding as Sara. Many scenes in the movie are memorable and will give you plenty to think about long after you have watched it. 10/10",9,0,1,5 March 2004
Captain Phillips," Hanks back on form
","In the 90's, you were pretty certain that any film with Tom Hanks would see him at the top of his game. The range of roles he got obviously helped, but for a few years he really did ace most of his movies. All good things come to an end and most of his recent efforts seems to have been a bit lame. It's good to report that Captain Phillips sees him back on the top of his game!!The film follows the true story of a cargo ship captained by Richard Phillips through the pirate waters of the Somali coast. It is very entertaining throughout and real edge of the seat watching. I have to confess that I didn't know the real story beforehand, so that really helped watching as I had no idea what was going to happen. Well worth a watch!",6,0,1,2 March 2014
10 Cloverfield Lane," Slightly disappointing second half
","10 Cloverfield tells the story of Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who has a car accident and wakes up inside a basement shelter that is sealed from the outside world. When she meets Howard (John Goodman) he says that there's been an attack from an unknown force that means it is unsafe to leave the basement.I knew nothing about the movie before seeing it and found the first half of the movie quite enthralling. Very little happens in the first half of the movie, but it is a tense psychological thriller. No surprise that Goodman is excellent. Unfortunately the longer the film went on the less I liked it. Having said that it's definitely worth watching for the first 60 minutes alone.",4,1,4,23 March 2016
The Equalizer," Entertaining movie
",In common with a lot of Hollywood features I have to confess I preferred the first half of this movie to the second half. The first half of the movie is very much character driven and focuses on the relationship between Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) and Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz). McCall is a man leading an ordinary life and getting away from the extraordinary talents from his earlier life. He befriends a prostitute Teri who is stuck in her situation despite dreams of being a singer. This part of the movie is extremely engaging and that certainly helps when the movie moves to a more action based focus. The second part of the movie is also pretty good although there's very little of the dialogue that makes the first hour so enjoyable. Well worth a watch!,6,3,6,12 October 2014
Source Code," Not very much originality to be found here
","I had heard a couple of very good reviews of Source Code, but must confess to being slightly disappointed with it myself.Source Code tells the story of a Colter Stevens who is placed onto a train that is about to be blown up in 8 minutes. Colter Stevens takes on another persons identity when he is placed on the train. He must solve the crime in order that a follow up crime can be averted. He is repeatedly placed back on the train to see if he can work out who is behind the plot.Maybe I'm a bit too old to buy into a plot like this, so consequently I could never warm to the film. I am a big fan of Jake Gyllanhaal and he can't be faulted for his performance in Source Code. The same can also be said for Michelle Monaghan who certainly brightens the mood as his girlfriend on the train. The interplay between the two leads certainly bears comparison with a similar situation in Groundhog Day.",4,4,6,3 May 2011
Skyfall," Definitely one of the better Bond movies
",This is Daniel Craig's third Bond movie. The first of these was very good and the second a bit disappointing. The good news is that the third is very good again.As ever the opening sequence is thrilling and sets up the movie. There's an interesting twist on the titles sequence which is pretty good. The plot of the movie revolves around the loss of a list of identities of all the British spies around the world. Bond must discover who has this list and then recover it before it endangers the lives of all the spies. Obviously the why they have it is also very important and this becomes the crux of the film. Daniel Craig was very good throughout and in particular in the early part of the film where he shows some of Bond's flaws. As ever Judy Dench was good in support and there also several other good supporting roles. The best part of the movie is that it leaves you wanting more and I'm certainly looking forward to the next episode.,6,2,9,10 November 2012
The Hangover," Competition for the Farrelly brothers
","I noticed that this movie was lingering in the Top 250 movies, so I decided to take a look. The film is very much along the lines of a Farrelly brothers movie and follows a Bachelor party in Las Vegas. Three of the four middle aged guys wake up and have no recall what happened the night before. They have lost the groom and they need to try to piece together what happened during the previous night. The humour in the movie is very base, but the story does zip along. I found a couple of the visual jokes very funny and it was very light-hearted throughout. I probably will not remember a thing about it in a few months, but it was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. It seems the director Todd Phillips will provide competition for the Farrelly's in the future.",4,3,7,17 June 2009
Iron Man 3," Ticks all the boxes
","There aren't any great surprises in Iron Man 3. If you enjoyed the first couple of Iron man movies the chances are you'll like this one as well.The movie is obviously at it's best when Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is showboating. As with the first couple of instalments there are plenty of scenes where this happens. The character isn't really fleshed out any further though. The villain of the film would also have benefited from a couple of extra scenes to flesh out their character. The film isn't a masterpiece, but it's a pretty pleasant couple of hours of mindless fun.I saw this movie in 3d, but don't really think that helped or hindered my enjoyment of the movie. Save yourself a couple of bucks and watch the film in 2d!",6,0,2,9 May 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Fantastic Entertainment
","Although, I love this trio of movies I do think that the likes of Indy, Luke and Doc Brown have a lot to answer for with the glut of sequels that are served up every year. For anybody that doesn't know the plot, Indy and his ex battle it out with Nazis to get the arc of the Covenant which contains the 10 commandments. This is an old fashioned film in the sense that we have goodies and baddies and we always know that the baddies are going to get their just deserts. Fantastic entertainment and the sort of film that you can watch over and over again.",9,0,0,12 January 2004
Spartacus," Kubrick's finest hour
","I've got to say that I'm not a massive admirer of Kubrick, but there's no denying that this is a very fine movie. Back in the days when extras weren't computer generated this is very much the film that Gladiator was based on.Kirk Douglas plays the lead and the length of the film gives the actor and director plenty of time to develop the character. Spartacus starts the film as a slave, but is spotted and trained up to be a gladiator. During an uprising he becomes the leader of an army who simply want freedom from the roman empire.Where this film wins over Gladiator is in the character development and dialogue. Olivier, Simmons, Laughton, Ustinov and Curtis all put in fine performances and the 'I'm Spartacus' is probably one of the most memorable scenes in movie history. 10/10",8,6,11,10 April 2004
Deepwater Horizon," Not totally sure of the point of this movie
","Turned up at the cinema to find that our chosen movie was sold out, so decided to take a punt on Deepwater Horizon. I'm not sure whether it's possible to put a spoiler into this as most people will already be fully aware of the story line. I really can't see the point of the movie because of this. If you have spent the past few years is isolation then the movie tells the story of the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling platform in the Gulf Of Mexico. They are drifting behind schedule and starting to take short cuts in an attempt to reduce costs and save time.I'm a fan of Wahlberg and Malkovich, so some of their scenes were enjoyable to watch. Think the movie may have been better if it focused more on Mike Williams and less on the event. A lot of the dialogue was a bit clunky though and felt like it had been lifted from the investigations. There were also a couple of very contrived scenes. The film does give you a flavour of what it must have been like to be on the Deepwater Horizon. Maybe that was the point of it.",5,18,32,13 October 2016
United 93," What would you have done
","I'm sure most people at least considered what they would have done had they have been on one of the planes on 9/11. This was especially the case with Flight 93, since due to a flight delay, they were aware of what their fate was going to be. Unlike the traditional MO of hijackers they weren't about to enter into negotiations. They were being used as a bomb to cause destruction on the ground.I seem to remember at the time that the actions of the passengers on Flight 93 was considered as a selfless act to stop the destruction on the ground. The film portrays this very much as an attempt for survival and I suspect this is probably very close to what really happened. If you've got a 1 in thousand chance of surviving by storming the cockpit it's better than a certain death if you do nothing.The film is tense and gripping and really tugs at the emotions. Surely one of the best films of this year, but be prepared for a depressing experience. If you like feel good movies steer well clear of this.",9,5,10,9 June 2006
It," Good Fun
","As usual I didn't know too much about IT heading for the cinema beyond it probably being based on the Stephen King novel. It was indeed based on the Stephen King novel and tells the tale of a group of bullied school kids. The school kids also suffer rather dysfunctional families, but they have an even bigger problem ... They are being terrorised by a supernatural clown in a town which suffers more than the usual number of missing children. The movie is very nicely played by the actors and it's nice to have a connection with the characters. It's the usual horror film formula with a mix of laughs and frights throughout the movie. If you love the genre then you'll probably love IT and it's a pretty entertaining couple of hours.",6,2,7,13 September 2017
Casablanca," A cliche is appropriate - This is a timeless masterpiece
","Anybody that likes movies must know this story. What really makes this film stand out from so many others is the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman. The ending is classic since Ilsa and Rick are separated even though Ilsa wants to be with Rick rather than war hero Victor. Nowadays, the films ending would probably change and even if it didn't a sequel a couple of years later would see them together. The great thing about Casablanca is that we never know what became of these three.",10,1,2,22 December 2003
Minority Report," One of the better blockbusters of recent years
","It's amazing how many blockbusters leave you feeling slightly short changed by the end of the movie. Minority Report certainly isn't one of these, and whilst it will not change your life, it will certainly provide you with something to talk about after the credits roll.Based in the future it follows the experimental trial of a system which foretells murders and stops them from happening. The system in question consists of three precogs who can see the future. The murderer therefore never commits the crime, but is still sentenced.Tom Cruise plays John Anderton who is responsible for stopping the murders based on the information provided by the precogs. Whilst this isn't Spielberg's finest hour he still demonstrates his undoubted craft. Overall 8/10",7,0,2,17 February 2004
Finding Neverland," Better than expected
","I've got to say that I approached this film with some trepidation. The reviews weren't sparkling, but I've got to say that I found it quite a pleasant experience. The film is about the eternal child that is J M Barrie who wrote Peter Pan. He befriends a widow, or more precisely, her children and builds the fantasy world that will eventually spawn Peter Pan. His wife is obviously somewhat skeptical about the relationship which drives Barrie further into his imaginary world.This is very well acted and directed with a relatively slow pace which is very pleasing. Johny Depp rarely has an off day and he's on form again here. I've always find Kate Winslett alluring and she's also quite well (type)cast in her part. Well worth 7/10",6,0,0,18 November 2004
Training Day," Elements of the truth
","Although it's probably a bit over the top, you can't help thinking that the stroyline here probably has elements of the truth. Jake (Hawke) is a rookie on the narcotics division and is paired with one of the top officers Alonzo (Washington). Alonzo doesn't conform to the norm however to get results and Jake is pushed into doing things that he is very uncomfortable with. The more he does the harder it is to turn back and he becomes embroiled in Alonzo's schemes. A very good movie with fine performances from both the leads. Washington won an oscar for this and whilst it's arguable whether that was deserved he certainly puts in a fine turn. It's to Hawke's credit that he is not totally overshadowed. 8/10",6,0,13,3 May 2004
John Wick," Better than expected
","Under normal circumstances I wouldn't have seen John Wick. I'm not a big fan of action thrillers and Keanu Reeves hasn't been my favourite actor either. The selection of movies was pretty limited at the theatres, so decided to give John Wick a chance.Have to confess that I was pleasantly surprised by the film and enjoyed it much more than expected. In particular Keanu Reeves as John Wick was very good. In the past the only roles that he ever looked comfortable and appropriate in were the characters who looked somewhat bewildered about what was going on. The first Matrix film in particular played to his strengths whereas the follow ups didn't convince as he was supposed to be a stronger character. There is no doubt that he pulls this off in John Wick, so will not be quite as snooty about Keanu in the future! The film itself is quite stylish and somewhat similar to Sin City in terms of style. Personally I found the on screen comments quite annoying, but the film is reasonably written in terms of screenplay. If you are a fan of action thrillers and/or Keanu Reeves I'm quite sure you'll really enjoy this movie.",5,0,5,24 April 2015
Rocketman," Slightly disappointed
","I had high hopes for Rocketman to be my film of the year so far. Unfortunately it failed to live up to those expectations.The film focuses on Elton John's formative years via way of flashbacks in a rehab meeting. Never been a big fan of his music, but there's certainly some classic tunes in his back catalogue. Taron Egerton plays Elton with Jamie Bell playing his sidekick Bernie Taupin. There's no doubt that both leads and Egerton in particular put a lot of energy and enthusiasm into their roles. Although it didn't quite live up to expectations it's still a pretty entertaining watch. Have seen a few press clips saying that some of the content isn't 100% accurate. There is no doubt that this is the way that Elton John feels about his early years, so it's therefore reflecting those feelings.I wasn't aware that this was a musical production, so if you are not a fan of actors bursting into song you are probably best advised to give this one a miss.",6,3,5,18 June 2019
A Star Is Born," One of the best films of 2018
",Must admit to not having great expectations of a star is born. Pleasantly surprised to report that it is one of the best films of 2018.The film tells the story of Jack (Bradley Cooper) and Ally (Lady Gaga) who are surprisingly thrown together. Jack is an aging rock and roll performer whilst Ally is a down trodden singer. The film is made by the performances of the two leads who are both outstanding. You feel very little empathy for characters in so many films nowadays. With Star is Born it as if you become the characters who go through a roller coaster of emotions during the movie. In addition to this many of the supporting characters are also very rounded and interesting. It also makes you realize why so many celebrities struggle with the demands of fame.If you don't catch it at the cinema make sure you take a look when it hits the small screen.,8,4,7,7 November 2018
Gravity," A pleasant surprise!
","On the face of it, Gravity doesn't sound like a bunch of fun. The film is pretty much entirely based on a monologue from Sandra Bullock with occasional support from George Clooney. Bullock plays Ryan Stone who is a medical engineer on a space flight. Things go wrong and she is supported by Matt Kowalsky a veteran astronaut. Amazingly the movie is a lot better than you imagine beforehand. The acting of Bullock and Clooney is fine and the visuals are amazing. It's very hard to believe that the movie wasn't actually shot in space or a gravity free environment. It's also in 3d and a rare example where the format really works well. Very enjoyable!",6,1,3,1 December 2013
Erin Brockovich," Julia's best performance to date
",This is one of those films you buy on DVD when you're building your collection. The fact I've got it on DVD shows it was released when i was building my DVD collection. Having said that it's not a bad film and is certainly Julia Roberts finest moment to date. When we first meet Erin she's struggling to make ends meet and hoping to make some money from a compensation claim. Once that goes astray she gets a job from her solicitor Ed Masry (Albert Finney) because he screwed up. People like Erin because she is normal and she becomes embroiled in a case against a multinational company.,5,1,5,22 December 2003
Se7en," No cop out here
",You frequently walk out of movies feeling somewhat cheated by the production companies desire to have a feel good conclusion. How many movies are quite entertaining until a knee jerk conclusion spoils the rest of the movie. Se7en doesn't suffer this conclusion and thank god Fincher refused to change the ending of the movie.Somerset (Freeman) is on his final week of police duty when paired with Mills (Pitt). They are allocated to a case that eventually turns out to be John Doe (Spacey) creating his own masterpiece of seven deadly sins. The characters area all given plenty of space to develop during the movie. The contrast between Mills and Somerset at either ends of their police careers is particularly interesting. 9/10,7,0,0,14 March 2004
Fight Club," I'll observe the second rule of fight club
","This isn't the sort of film that people will be on the fence about - you'll either love it or hate it and I'm in the love it camp. All of the leads turn in their best performances and when these are Pitt, Norton, & Bonham-Carter you're onto a winner. Jack is living a humdrum life until he meets Tyler Durden who changes it in the most dramatic fashion. I'll not spoil the twist, but the film does lose it's way a little towards the end. I think Norton steels the show and must be one of the finest actors around Hollywood at the moment.",7,0,2,23 December 2003
Darkest Hour," Very entertaining
",Because Black Panther was sold out I've actually seen Darkest Hour twice. Unlike some films where you see a whole new layer when watching a film for the second time can't really say that this happened with Darkest Hour.The story is set in a short timeframe of a few weeks as Churchill takes over as Prime Minister of Britain. Whilst I was aware of a lot of the storylines covered in the film I really didn't realise that they happened in such a short space of time. What I thought took a few months was actually just a few weeks. Obviously the focus of the film is Gary Oldman as Churchill. I can well imagine he was thinking about the oscar potential when he read the script and that seems likely to be awarded soon. It is undoubtedly a fine performance and very watchable from start to finish. Well worth watching.,7,0,3,1 March 2018
The Maze Runner," Light and fluffy
","The Maze Runner is very much a film in the style of Hunger Games. Unfortunately there are no stand out actors such as Jennifer Lawrence to lift it into something more special. Having said that the movie is fairly entertaining and pretty decent way to spend a couple of hours on a flight which is where I watched it.The film tells the story of Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) who is dropped outdoors with his memory erased. It soon becomes apparent that they need to escape through the maze which is complete with an array of deadly obstacles. Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) arrives as the sole female character.There isn't very much original material to be found in the Maze Runner, but if you are a fan of the Hunger Games you will probably find it a pretty entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.",5,0,2,17 December 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Star Wars Back to form
","Having been thrilled by the original Star Wars movies (Episodes 4-6) in my youth I wasn't alone in being disappointed by the return of the franchise for Episodes 1-3. Last years Episode 7 was a return to form and delighted to say that Rogue One is another blast of escapism at it's best.I thought this was Episode 8 beforehand, but it actually fits between episodes 3 and 4. It fleshes out one of the plot lines that is in the original Star Wars movie. We also get tantalising glimpses of many of the characters. The main story line concerns Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) who is the daughter of one of the chief architects in the construction of the death star. She is charged with stealing the plans to the death star. Jones is excellent in the lead role and after the feisty Rey in episode 1 it is good to see female characters getting screen time. The movie has the same sense of fun and adventure as the main Star Wars movies. It doesn't feel like an exercise to make easy money and for that we should be grateful. If you love the Star Wars movies you will love Rogue One.",7,1,10,25 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Definitely not marvelous
","I go to movies with someone who is really into the Marvel franchise, so although it's not really my favourite genre of movies see them all. Believe this movie is splitting the Marvel fan base who are probably the most passionate of the movie groups. I'm on the fence and whilst it isn't the best of marvel it isn;t the worst either.This movie was obviously eagerly anticipated as it was name checked at the end of Infinity War last year. It goes back a few years into the initial meeting between Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and Captain Marvel (Brie Larson). I would have liked it to be much more of a character driven movie, but it focuses mostly on the action sequences. To be fair that's pretty much true of most of the Marvel movies. Anyway the best bits of the movie are where we find out more of the back story of the main characters. Definitely one for the many fans of Marvel although they may come out of the movie very happy or very angry judging from other reviews.",5,7,12,12 March 2019
Shakespeare in Love," Made for the Academy
","Overall this is a fairly nondescript movie that has few scenes that you will recall a couple of weeks after seeing it. It is however perfect fayre for those at the academy with their love of period costume dramas. It surely wasn't the best film of the year, but it is a reasonably entertaining 2 hour movie. The film was also the cause of the uncontrolled blubbing from Gwyn at the Oscars.The film follows the young William Shakespeare and is love affair with Lady Viola played out during rehearsals for Romeo and Juliet. Will obviously had some severe disorder since it's quite unbelievable that anybody could have been taken in with Lady Viola's attempt to pass herself off as a man.7/10",5,2,5,14 March 2004
Iron Man 2," Slightly Disappointing
","The first Iron Man film was a pleasant surprise. The second instalment therefore carried higher expectations. Although not a disaster the second film doesn't quite live up to the first film.The story revolves around the government wanting to have the technology of the Iron Man from Tony Stark. Stark is holding onto the information and says nobody will be able to mimic this for many years. There's no surprises to find that this doesn't turn out to be true.Downey Jr is again pretty entertaining as Stark and Mickey Rourke is also pretty good as Ivan Vanko. It sounds like Johansson and Paltrow didn't get on that well, but there's not too much evidence of that on screen which is slightly disappointing.",3,2,4,25 September 2010
The Hunger Games," Good film!
",I didn't really know anything about the Hunger Games before seeing it at the movies.For others like me The Hunger Games is a fight to the death between representatives from the 12 districts in a future world. There are 2 contestants selected from each district and the winner is the last survivor. The story follows District 12's participant Katniss who volunteers to replace her sister Prim.The film is interesting and engaging throughout and there's a definite influence from the Truman Show and Lord of the Flies amongst others. It certainly also leaves you with plenty to talk and think about afterwards. I found out that it was based on books and I enjoyed the film enough to make me go out and buy the trilogy. Hopefully the books will be as entertaining as the film!,7,1,5,22 April 2012
The Impossible," Great film
","The Impossible is a film that focuses on a families experience of the South East Asia Tsunami in 2004. This is a true story and when the film starts with an insight into the family on Christmas day everybody knows what is about to happen.Although the Tsunami sequence plays an important part of the film, the majority of the film focuses on the aftermath. The arrival of the Tsunami was nicely done and there's no doubt that the sudden arrival of it will have been that many people experienced it. Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts play the lead roles and it was great to see McGregor put in a good performance. The film is best when it focuses on the kindness of people towards each other. Very entertaining.",7,1,3,19 January 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Fairly entertaining, but a bit long
","Pirates is a fairly typical blockbuster. The film was guaranteed to generate a good box office return after the success of the first movie. All the main players in the first film are back again.The film isn't particularly coherent and is really a series of set pieces. The acting isn't great, but you wouldn't really expect great acting from a cast that includes Knightly and Bloom.Having said that it's still fairly entertaining fayre and whilst Knightly and Bloom aren't the greatest of actors they look quite good. The last hour, in particular, is pretty thrilling and you get plenty of bangs for your buck!",5,11,20,29 July 2006
Argo," Great film
","Due to travelling I'm a bit out of touch with what's going on in the movie world. I decided to pop down to the cinema and had little idea about any of the movies that were playing. I logged onto IMDb and of the movies that were playing Argo had the best reviews.Argo is the story about a rescue mission to repatriate 6 USA citizens that escaped to the Canadian ambassadors private residence during the Iranian Hostage crisis in 1979. The us embassy was taken over by militants demanding the return of the shah from America. During the takeover the 6 escaped and were in more danger than the other hostages because the media were unaware about them. The film focuses on the mission to get the 6 out of Iran. It is a very tense film that has you on the edge of your chair frequently. It is very well acted and directed and I can imagine Affleck having a chance of an Oscar nomination for direction. There's also a great supporting cast including John Goodman and Alan Arkin. Something tells me the ending was a little over dramatised for Hollywood, but that's only a small quibble in a very enjoyable film. Go and watch!",8,2,4,2 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Better than expected
","I didn't see the previous Star Trek movie and entered the movie with an open mind. I can't say I'm a huge fan of sci-fi films in general or the Star Trek franchise in particular. I did watch the original Star Trek TV series when I was young and enjoyed it. Never been overly impressed with any of the Star Trek related movies. Having said all of that I have to confess that I was pleasantly surprised with Star Trek into Darkness and enjoyed the movie.I suspect the main reason I enjoyed the film is that it has a very similar tongue in cheek feel that the original Star Trek series had. The plot isn't the greatest, but it ticks all the right boxes. Zachary Quinto as Spock is particularly good and Simon Pegg as Scotty was also going to work out well. The set and visuals are pretty impressive and the best thing I can say about the movie is that I will definitely watch the next one!",6,0,1,28 June 2013
12 Angry Men," Masterpiece
","Virtually the entire film takes place within the jurors room. This just goes to prove that you don't need special 	  effects to make a film gripping. A good dialogue and a superb performances make the 90 minutes fairly zip along. The case 	  is an open and shut case, but is it ? The best courtroom drama ever made even though strictly speaking it isn't in the 	  courtroom. The characters don't have names, but jurors 3,4 and 10 are the real hard nuts. Lee J Cobb is outstanding as juror 	  3 and Henry Fonda gambles and wins as juror 8.",10,0,1,1 December 2003
The English Patient," See this at the Cinema
","One of the best Oscar 'Best Pictures' of recent times. This is a film that is best appreciated at the theatre. The small screen cannot do justice to the cinematography. The film really consists of two stories. The main story is told in flashback as the English Patient spends the last few days of the war (and his life) in a bombed out Italian villa. This is the story of the affair between Count Laszlo de Almásy (Fiennes) and Katharine Clifton (Scott Thomas). There is certainly chemistry between the leads and Katharine isn't the usual one dimensional Hollywood female role. The other story between Hanna (Binoche) and Kip Singh is certainly not as convincing. Willem Dafoe is the glue between the stories who wants to find out whether the English Patient is Almásy. Sorry to harp on, but the real star of the film is the cinematographer and if this didn't win that award from the Academy I'd be amazed.",7,2,5,22 December 2003
Public Enemies," Good rather than great
","I must admit that I have a big problem with Michael Mann movies. His movies are extremely stylish and it always seems like every single shot is carefully considered and crafted. His films look great, but I always find this very distracting. Rather than sitting back and enjoying the movie, I find myself considering the lighting and camera angles.Anyway as per usual Public Enemies looks extremely good on the big screen. It tells the story of the early FBI investigation of John Dillinger, the gangster who was popular with the public. Christian Bale plays Melvin Purvis who is tasked with hunting down Dillinger played by Johnny Depp. The leads are played quite nicely, but you are never drawn into any of the characters. I can't help feeling it should have been more engaging, but it looks great on screen. It's classic Mann.",5,1,2,9 July 2009
Knives Out," Interesting Murder Mystery
","Knives out is a murder mystery which is better than the average murder mystery.For a start the cast list of Knives Out is excellent. This includes Daniel Craig as Benoit Blank who is hired to investigate the murder of the rich patriarch Harlon Thrombey played by the great Christopher Plummer. As you watch the movie you come up with your own ideas of who is behind the murder. I guyess some of my ideas were right and some were wrong, but the clues are all in the movie if you are clever enough to pick them up.An enjoyable watch although the movie probably will not lose much when it is shown on the small screen.",6,2,4,3 December 2019
Spider-Man 2," A superior blockbuster
","In most recent years the summer months have brought an endless stream of blockbuster drivel. I was beginning to think that the art of making movies was being lost to the insatiable thirst of the production companies desire to bank as much money as possible each season.Spiderman 2 has restored my faith. It's got everything you come to expect from a blockbuster; it's got action, thrills and spills, a romance, comedy, drama and tragedy. Fortunately it's also got what you don't expect ... It's good !!! The main reason for this is the way all the characters are fleshed out. The good guys have problems and flaws whilst the bad guys are really bad through circumstances rather than through choice. In my opinion this is much better than the original and leaves you looking forward to the next film which again is unusual.This franchise is still revving up and could be the biggest thing of the naughties. 8/10",7,0,1,19 July 2004
127 Hours," Another Danny Boyle masterpiece?
","127 Hours is Danny Boyles follow up to the huge commercial and critical success of Slumdog Millionaire.I normally like to see a movie without knowing too much details about the plot and especially the ending. 127 Hours is based on a true story of Aron who gets trapped in a cave after a rock falls on his arm and becomes lodged. Although not familiar with the story I had heard details about what happened which did spoil my enjoyment of the film. I will not repeat the ending for those people that don't know, but i suspect the majority of movie goers will know what's coming.Whilst trapped Aron creates a video diary of what he expect to be his last few days of life. During this time he has flash backs and dreams of his life. I couldn't help thinking that this could have been more interesting.James Franco is obviously the large focus of the film and he does a pretty good job as Aron. With the exception of the opening and closing credit sequence Danny Boyle is also good although I don't think it ever reaches the heights of Slumdog.",5,5,12,12 January 2011
Hot Fuzz," A bit of a disappointment
","This is a comedy from the team that made 'Shaun of the Dead' with lots of the cast also appearing in both films. The film follows 'police officer' Nicholas Angel who is too successful in London. He is given a promotion and a relocation into leafy England. The film follows Angel as he settles into his new role.The film doesn't really have the same zest as Shaun of the Dead and the producer could have been a bit more ruthless with the final cut and chopped 30 minutes from the running time. It's not really that the film is too long, it's just not got enough material for 2 hours. It's pleasant enough, but not in the same league as Shaun.",5,1,6,9 March 2007
Spotlight," Watch it once
","I didn't catch Spotlight when it was originally released, but caught it when it was playing after receiving the best picture Oscar.The film tells the story of the Boston Globe investigation into sexual abuse by members of the catholic church. It therefore belongs very much in the category of movies you have to see rather than you want to see. As is common with a lot of cases of this nature the perpetrators escape justice. The Boston Globe have to try and expose exactly what is going on.The script and acting are exceptional. the film undoubtedly leaves a lasting impression. In common with Schindlers List Spotlight is a film that I am glad that I watched, but have no intention of watching again.",6,0,2,23 March 2016
500 Days of Summer," An off beat gem
","I have to confess that if there's one genre of films that I particularly enjoy, it's off beat comedies. I love films that are unstructured where the characterisations take priority over the story. I'm pleased to say that (500) days of summer is one of those films and it's very enjoyable.The film focuses on the relationship between Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel) over 500 days. The film isn't sequenced however and jumps around over the 500 days. This makes for an interesting effect as one moment they're getting to know each other and the next they hate the sight of each other. The two leads play nice roles and the two characters are opposite from the conventional male/female stereotypes in terms of their romance. If you are like me and love off beat films check this out.",6,0,1,18 November 2009
Juno," Dealing with stuff way past her maturity
","This is a hugely enjoyable film. Juno is a high school kid who has to deal with an unplanned pregnancy. She does this in a very matter of fact way and after toying with the idea of abortion decides to find foster parents. The remainder of the film takes us through to the birth of the child.The real pleasure in the film is the acting and the interplay between the characters. The supporting cast including father (J.K. Simmons), step mother (Allison Janney), best friend (Olivia Thirlby), boyfriend (Michael Cera), and potential foster parents (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) all put in fine performances. Ellen Page will obviously take most of the plaudits for the lead role and deservedly so, as she makes Juno into both a very strong and sympathetic character.In many ways Juno reminds me of Leon. It is a testament to Ellen Page that her performance certainly stands comparison with Natalie Portman although I suppose Portman was at then other side of the teenage years when she filmed Leon. Juno is also considerably more upbeat and whilst an unplanned pregnancy normally leads to much angst in movies it is simply something else to deal with for Juno. My only slight reservation is that it may run the risk of glamorising teenage pregnancy.",7,3,9,22 February 2008
L.A. Confidential," Like a good wine
","This film is like a good wine - it matures with age. Every time that I've watched this movie I've liked it more and I liked it a lot to begin with.
The story follows three cops with a totally different outlook on life and MO. Very much like real life these cops are not model citizens. Bud White (Russell Crowe) dishes out his own punishment without the need for intervention of the courts. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is not averse to making a bit of profit from newspaper hacks whilst arresting people. Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is quite happy to grass on his partners to further his career. The three cops may not be particularly well matched, but they work together to solve the Nite Owl murder and find something altogether more sinister.The acting from the three leads is outstanding and what makes this movie stand out even more is the excellent support from the rest of the cast. Kim Basinger, James Cromwell and Danny DeVito are all worthy of mention as is the script and the direction by Curtis Hanson. The only minor disappointment is the finish which was a little too Hollywood. A modern masterpiece 10/10",10,8,15,15 February 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Above average blockbuster
","This film sits firmly in the 'blockbuster' category. As such you can more or less guarantee a stupid plot, dodgy script, loads of cgi and stereo-typical characters. The Day after Tomorrow certainly doesn't break the mould on these terms, but it is above average for the following reasons. The subject matter here is actually quite interesting and whilst the causes of the life changing events are never any more than brushed over, at least they are aired. The ending is as upbeat as it could be, but you know everyone is in for a tough life after this. It's not likely we'll get a sequel to this.Global warming is about to make the biggest storm(s - 3) of our time. Paradoxically this shuts down the gulf stream and eventually plunges earth into a sudden ice age. The film follows the path of the storm and watches a few poor mortals trying to survive. The characters all play a secondary role to the effects, but the actors make the most of their roles.WARNING: PLOT(?) SPOILERS It's quite interesting to see just how thoughtless the plot can be. After New York is flooded a large ship is seen navigating the skyscrapers before surprisingly running aground - Quite why is never explained. The reason is finally revealed much later - it's to make for an exciting scene later in the movie. PLOT SPOILERS OVERLet's be honest we go to see films like this for thrills and spills. The Day after tomorrow certainly delivers and is better than most of it's counterparts. 7/10.",6,0,0,31 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," The definition of what's wrong with the 'Blockbuster' movie
","Most of my reviews contain pithy little comments about the plot, whether the movie is good or bad, and who the movie might suit. Pirates of the Caribbean 3 has inspired my creative juices though, so i think a longer review is justified. For those people that prefer the pithy reviews ...Pirates of the Caribbean is your average blockbuster with plenty of bangs and very little in the way of good acting or story telling. As with the second POTC there is very little in the way of plot with the film being a series of set pieces. Most people that are looking for eye candy will be entertained by the movie since it contains Messrs Depp, Bloom & Knightly. There's plenty of action as well for those adrenalin junkies that enjoy plenty of explosions and fighting.Pirates of the Caribbean 3 is a classic example of what is wrong with Blockbuster movies.The acting in the movie is appalling. However good looking Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly are they cannot act and have less presence than Marlon Brando's wig. It's probably a bit unfair to compare any actors with Brando, but I'm sure if you plucked a couple of good looking people from the Mall they'd be better actors than Bloom and Knightly. I've actually given the film an extra point because it was rather entertaining to see just how poor they were! Having said that the rest of the cast can't be excused either and the performances of Rush and Depp are probably worse than Bloom and Knightly, since they can act in the first place! One of the fundamentals of film making is that you should be moved in some way by the characters. This is certainly not the case with POTC 3 though and as the trials and tribulations unfold you are completely detached and couldn't care less who bites the bullet and who survives. I would be absolutely staggered if anyone showed any emotional reaction to the film whatsoever.Bearing in mind the previous comments the director must take his share of the blame. Verbinski is clearly more interested in the cgi than the fundamentals of the film. I suspect if you put aside the last couple of scenes you could rearrange the previous 30 or 40 scenes in any order and it wouldn't make much difference to the finished product. It feels like each actor has been allocated scenes based on their order in the cast. I'm sure most people will be aware of the friction on the set of the Magnificent Seven and this has a similar feel to it. Johnny Depp obviously wasn't content to appear once, so appeared several times and you can't help thinking that he might have had something to do with that himself.The film is too long and the editor should have cut an hour from the running time, but maybe the 168 minutes gives the film some gravitas. Apart from the acting inabilities of Knightly and Bloom some of the effects are quite good. That's one thing you are normally sure of with blockbusters though ... a few good effects.The thing that most annoys me about blockbusters ... I (and many others) go and see them! You feel like you are missing out if you don't go to see it, so even though you know it's going to be average you still shell out your hard earned cash! Sucker!!! For those people thinking of going to see POTC 3 at the movies ... wait to watch it on TV!",3,2,5,20 June 2007
Deadpool 2," Entertaining couple of hours
",For anybody that doesn't know Deadpool 2 is the sequel to the successful first film released a couple of years ago. Ryan Reynolds returns to the role of Wade Wilson/Deadpool in a role that seems made for him.As with the first film the plot plays a secondary role to the set piece comedy one liners. Fans of the X-men franchise will be pleased to see a bunch of characters who they will know. In some ways the movie reminds me of the Austin Powers movies in terms of the unrelenting movie references and comedy. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the movie it will not live very long in the memory. Any fans of the first film are sure to love it.,6,0,2,20 June 2018
X-Men," Better than x2 ?
","I know I'm probably in the minority with this view, but I found the original X-Men movie more enjoyable than the second outing. I find it better because of the introduction to all the characters and a more rounded storyline. When one of the lead characters bites the dust at the end of the second movie I couldn't help thinking that they'll be back in X3 so why should I really care.Anyway back to X-Men which is set in the present day and focuses on a new breed of humans who have mutant powers. The mutations take various forms which means the mutants have just about every power you could imagine. The 'normal' humans are somewhat uncomfortable and take the forlorn decision to marginalise the mutants. The mutants themselves are split into two bands the goodies being led by Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and the baddies led by Magneto (Ian McKellen). Most of the action is focussed on Wolverine (Weaving) and the film is good fun. 8/10",7,0,0,5 May 2004
Spider-Man 3," Not up to scratch
","I've got to say that I've enjoyed the previous 2 Spidey films. I'm not a big fan of movie franchises though and this is a classic case in point for the problems with film series. If I ever buy a box set of Spiderman movies this is (one of) the one(s) that would get played once. The film really doesn't stand up in it's own right. There's a little bit of character development and a couple of interesting sub plots, but it really isn't enough.To be fair I've certainly seen worse films and I do like Dunst and Maguire even if their chemistry wasn't quite as good as in the previous 2 films. It's worth checking out, but not very satisfying. If your part way through watching the all day epic of Spiderman in 2015 you can quite happily go out for a couple of hours between 2 and 4 without missing anything important.",5,0,0,12 June 2007
Zodiac," Is this really worth of the Top 250?
","I saw this film recently without seeing any critical reviews or any vibe on here. Bearing in mind some of Fincher's previous work I was a bit disappointed with the film. I was somewhat surprised therefore to see it sitting proudly in the Top 250.The film follows the real life case of the serial killer labelled Zodiac who terrorised the San Fancisco area with a series of murders in the age of flower power. The main focus on the film is the investigation of the murders and I found the thick end of 3 hours a bit on the long side. Anyway it's clearly the case that lots of people enjoyed the film, so you'll need to check it out yourselves. I'll be watching it again when it's on TV to see if there's more to the film than I saw on my first viewing.",5,2,5,13 June 2007
The Terminator," The Best terminator
","Whereas the second film had the visuals and budget this film has got the dialogue and suspense. The dialogue is probably aided by Arnie's limited input. I'm sure everyone in the planet must know the story, but just in case, here goes. The future world is ruled by machines, but they face a struggle against a band of humans led by John Connor. They send a terminator (Schwarzenegger) back in time to kill John's mother which will thus stop John from being born. John Connor also sends someone back in time to protect his mother.It's interesting to see how much Sarah ( Hamilton) developed through the films. In this she is still a sweet innocent woman who is just about to have her life turned upside down. Well directed by Cameron this is probably the best of the Terminator films.",7,1,3,10 April 2004
Ready Player One," Speilberg has lost the plot.
","Having been away on holidays I went to see Ready Player One without knowing anything at all about the movie. There was one thing which totally surprised me about the movie. At the end as the credits played was shocked to see 'Directed by Steven Spielberg' flash on the screen. I really couldn't believe I'd just watched a movie by Spielberg.Ready Player One is the story of life in the 2040's where people tend to shun the struggles of real life in favour of playing a virtual game the Oasis. Anyway the creator of the game as left some easter eggs in the game which need solving to gain access to a great fortune. Most of the movie is played out in the virtual world and Parzival is the online persona of Wade. He makes allegiances with various players including Art3mis. In common with lots of movies of this type you never really get much empathy with any of the characters. The plot is secondary to the visual effects, but they don't really have much impact as you don't really care less who triumphs in the game.To be honest still haven't really gotten over the shock of Spielberg directing this. There is one thing for sure ... You can no longer rely on his name being involved with good movies.",4,9,20,4 April 2018
The Hateful Eight," Reservoir Dogs Part 2 ?
","I'm sure that I cannot be the only person that thought the recent Star Wars movie was very similar to the original Star Wars movie. This thought crossed my mind again when watching 'The Hateful Eight'. It reminded me a lot of Reservoir Dogs. Quite possibly my favourite Tarantino scene ever was the opening of Reservoir Dogs in the cafe. There are a few scenes in Hateful Eight which are somewhat similar to that scene in terms of dialogue and style. Obviously that can only be a good thing.Anyway although the Tarantino stories are very diverse you are more or less guaranteed a great script. The Hateful Eight is set in Winter and follows a bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russel) as he takes his captor Daisy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) for reward. The cast are excellent and the movie is gripping throughout. Incidentally some people may think it's a bit short of action, but the action is in the words rather than the deeds.",6,0,5,15 February 2016
"I, Tonya"," Do we get nearer the truth
","I guess like a lot of people who watch 'I, Tonya' I can remember the events surrounding Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan pretty well. This movie is focussed on these events from the viewpoint of Tonya Harding. You can't help wondering exactly what the truth is behind the story and only the people who were actually involved will ever really know. The movie tells the story of Tonya via and interview and little snippets of her life story. Some of the domestic violence scenes portrayed are quite raw and she certainly endured some very difficult relationships in her life.The skating scenes are really nicely shot and Margot Robbie does a pretty good job in the lead. Allison Janney steals the show playing Tonya's mother and was well worthy of the supporting actress award. The good thing is that she does get quite a lot of screen time as well. Well worth a watch.",6,1,1,7 March 2018
BlacKkKlansman," An entertaining Spike Lee movie
","Was considering seeing Blackkklansman, but was worried about how heavy it may be. My experience of previous Spike Lee movies is that they are mostly good movies, but a difficult watch. Suppose I shouldn't really criticize this as so many movies made n Hollywood have little substance.Anyway it's great to report that Blackkklansman is both an entertaining and powerful film. It tells the true story of Ron Stallworth infiltrating the ku kjlux klan. That may be seen as difficult for any individual, but Ron also has to contend with the added difficulty of being black. The film contains a lot of the trademark Spike Lee touches which with one exception add to the film rather than distracting you. There's great acting, humour, tension and a powerful conclusion. A great watch.",7,1,6,26 September 2018
Pan's Labyrinth," Brilliant Movie
","As a general rule I tend to steer clear of foreign language films, but critical acclaim of this movie tempted me into the theatre. I've got to say that I'm delighted about this because this is a delightful film.The film is set in the Spannish civil war as the fascist regime, brutally put down the resistance. The film is full of contradictions. At times it is brutal and shows sadistic graphic violence in a similar fashion to Schindlers List. At other times it is a fairy tale and similar to Edward Scissorhands. This comes together in a beautiful mix to make a mesmerising film and isn't it a shame that Hollywood can't make a few films like this rather than the latest instalment of a dated movie franchise.Don't let the subtitles put you off from seeing this film.",7,2,4,13 January 2007
Knocked Up," An intelligent rom com
","Ben is an unemployed guy living off a windfall he received some years earlier. He hangs around with other guys that have a similar outlook in life and enjoy watching porn, drinking beer and smoking pot. Alison is employed by a cable TV company and is just about to make her big break in front of the camera. The chances of these two guys hitting it off are equivalent to the chances of me hitting it off with Liv Tyler. Once the beer goggles are on though anything is possible and a one night stand turns out to have far greater consequences than it should do. The normal flow of a relationship is turned on it's head as the couple have a baby on the way before they know anything about one another. The film follows the development of this unusual relationship.Before seeing the film I expected it to be a bit in the mould of a Farrelly brothers production, but I've got to say the humour is considerably more subtle. Rogan and Heigl are excellent in the lead roles and I think the film is in the same league as 'When Harry Met Sally'. It is certainly nice to see a Rom Com with something new to say. It probably wouldn't lose a lot on the small screen, so if you miss it on the cinema check it out at home.",6,0,2,28 August 2007

","Much more atmospheric than the sequel Alien keeps the nerves jangling all the way through. The first time 	  you see an alien born must be one of the scarier moments in cinematic history. Sigourney Weaver became a star out of this 	  film, but it's really Ian Holm as Ash that takes the acting honours. This film must also take the prize for having the best 	  special effects per dollar. Check out the special features to see how the special effects were created on such a low budget.",8,0,1,1 December 2003
Closer," Not for special effects geeks
","Having read a little about this movie beforehand I knew that there was a bit of a contradiction with this movie. Casting my eye over the audience it was clear that the cast (and hype) had attracted a larger audience than you'd normally expect from a character/script driven film. Hopefully the film will convert some of the blockbuster junkies to take a look at a wider range of films.The film focuses entirely on the relationships between the four characters played by Law, Owen, Roberts and Portman. I wasn't entirely convinced by the realism of the Dan and Anna characters played by Law and Roberts. Maybe Portman and Owen lucked out by playing characters with more breadth , but their performances were both excellent. Overall it was a fairly depressing, if accurate reflection of modern day relationships.",6,0,0,22 January 2005
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Too much action?
",There is a lot to like about captain America. Unlike most of the other superheroes Captain America seems very beatable. His superpower shield isn't in the same league as some of the other marvel superpowers. This makes it a lot easier to relate to CA.Captain America: The Winter Soldier starts with fears that SHIELD has been infiltrated by unknown enemies. Captain America must act alone and cannot trust anyone which obviously leads to troubles. The film is very well acted with Scarlett Johansson being particularly good. The plot is OK and there's only one real gripe I've got with the film. During the action sequences it is very difficult to keep up with who's who. There are a lot of action sequences as well. Think I would have liked the film more if a few of the action sequences were cut and the film had a running time 30 minutes shorter. I'm quite sure that people who like Marvel superheroes/action films will love this though.,5,5,12,20 April 2014
Capote," Powerful Performance
","I have long been an admirer of Philip Seymour Hoffman from his roles in Magnolia and Boogie Nights amongst others. This film really belongs to him and he was a worthy recipient of the gong for best actor. This is very much a film for people who like to see a strong acting performance rather than a blockbuster film with lots of special effects.The film chronicle's the writing of the author Truman Capote's most popular book 'In Cold Blood'. The film shows Capote's research with the people involved in a mass murder and with the murderer's in particular. The film is very understated and I suspect people will apply their own values to the film and take away quite different things. As for myself I believe the film to show the early development of the media's exploitation of people, but as I said I'm sure other people may pick up quite different interpretations. Personally I preferred the films I mentioned earlier to Capote, but I still believe it's quite an interesting piece and well worth checking out - unless of course you're into bubblegum movies.",6,1,1,12 March 2006
Life of Pi," Very enjoyable
",I've just reviewed the movie 'The Impossible' and that would have been quite an appropriate way to describe 'Life of Pi'. Although I've not read the book the making of it as a movie must have seemed impossible.For those people that don't know the majority of 'Life of Pi' is played on a small boat. It focuses on the survival efforts of Pi Patel and a host of animals with a Bengal tiger Richard Parker being his main company. Suraj Sharma is brilliant as the lead character and obviously the vision of Ang Lee in bringing this to the screen is amazing. A great film and for a change the 3d probably enhances the film rather than distracting from it.,6,0,2,19 January 2013
Lost in Translation," Didn't quite live up to high expectations
","It's often the case that your expectations of a movie can influence your enjoyment of the movie. I generally steer clear of detailed reviews before seeing a movie, but do look at star ratings. It was clear that the critics certainly rated Lost In Translation highly and it was also the type of movie that I really enjoy, so I had very high expectations. I've got to say that I was slightly disappointed with it overall.Bill Murray plays Bob Harris who is a movie star whose best days are behind him.  He's in Tokyo shooting a commercial when he befriends the recently wed Charlotte played by Scarlett Johansson. No other characters play a significant role in the movie. Whilst the acting by the two leads is excellent and the script is very good there isn't really a lot that happens during the movie. The jokes about not being able to understand what the Japanese are saying start to wear thin by the end of the movie. Overall a 7/10.",6,0,0,8 February 2004
Doctor Strange," Perfect casting
","I've never been a massive fan of the Marvel genre, so always walk into the movies with a sense of apprehension. Pleased to report that Doctor Strange turned into an enjoyable couple of hours of escapism.There is no doubt that Benedict Cumberbatch is extremely well cast in the lead role. Doctor Stephen Strange is a brilliant neurosurgeon who suffers life changing damage that takes away his ability. He is desperate to recover that talent at any cost which forces him to search for alternative therapies. The movie is certainly quite gripping throughout and the visuals are excellent. I liked the pace of the movie as it explores the character of Strange. The supporting cast is also good, so it is well worth checking out regardless of whether you are a massive Marvel fan or not.",6,2,3,28 November 2016
Interstellar," A film that people are passionate about!
","I know there are some films that people get very passionate about. This passion is generally aroused because the movie is of a certain genre that they love or features an actor/director that they admire. There is no doubt that Interstellar is such a movie. It is a sci-fi film directed by Christopher Nolan and as such is a film that many people will have a big emotional investment with. If you read a few of the other reviews you will see this shining through.The film tells the story of earth as it struggles with food shortages. A worm hole is discovered in the solar system which gives mankind a chance to find a new home and source of food. The challenge facing those that leave and Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) in particular is leaving the people they love back on earth. I found the film beautifully shot, but a bit ponderous at times. The cast oozes quality though, so it's never dull. I will watch the film again to see if a second viewing may result in a more passionate response! If you are really into sci-fi movies or Christopher Nolan I am quite sure you will absolutely love the film.",6,3,6,23 December 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Awards candy
","Three billboards has already won a bunch of awards and seems certain to do well on Oscar night. I've been a big fan of Frances McDormand since the release of Fargo over 20 years ago. This film really gives her room to show off her talent and it is a spellbinding performance from start to end. She's very likely to bag the best actress award and it will be well deserved.The film tells the story of Mildrid (McDormand) who wants justice for the murder of her daughter several months ago. Frustrated at the lack of progress in the case she rents three billboards in an attempt to focus the mind of officer Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) back to the case. The film examines the tensions this causes within the family, the police department and the local community.This film is certainly not for the film goers who crave continuous action or a feelgood factor. If you enjoy a good script, great acting and an interesting plot you'll love the movie though. A really enjoyable watch.",8,1,4,1 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The end of the saga
","Some 43 years ago I was one of many queuing to see the new Star Wars film. Turns out that was the fourth episode of the series, but finally got to see the concluding part of the saga.Was worried going into the film that there might be a lot of needless scenes paying tribute to characters from the franchise. That certainly proved to be a true as there were a bunch of scenes in the movie that said a sad farewell to the characters we have loved over the years whilst contributing little to the plot. Having said that I'm sure that most people will be thrilled to see as many of the star wars characters as possible. There was certainly a lot more of Leia (Carrie Fisher RIP) in the film than imagined there would be.I have to say that I really liked Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) in Episode 7. Never really felt that the chemistry was the same in episode 8 and for the first part of The Rise of Skywalker the characterisation of Rey seemed a bit off the mark. Anyway things improved and really enjoyed the climax of the movie.Still think the original trio of films is the best, but the final trio was certainly a big improvement on the middle trio. Should stress that I'm talking about release sequence rather than the episode sequence!",7,4,10,28 January 2020
Pacific Rim," Difficult to empathise with characters
","I have to confess that I was bowled over by Pan's Labyrinth, so was looking forward to Guillermo del Toro's latest film.Overall the film was very disappointing. I have seen another review that raves about the film being exciting from the start to the end. I can kind of see where the reviewer is coming from as the film is pretty much action all the way through. The downside to that though is that there is very little in terms of character development. The characters and plot play second fiddle to the action. You really don't care who lives and who dies because you have no insight or feeling towards any of the characters. This film is very much for the adrenalin junkies and if that's you you'll love it.",3,5,10,26 August 2013
Corpse Bride," Animation for adults
","I'm sure there will be some children that enjoy this movie, but unlike W&G which will suit both adults and children, this is going to appeal mostly to the adults. It is unmistakeably a Burton movie with the usual Gothic overtones, but fairytale feel.Victor (Depp) fluffs his trial run marriage vows to Victoria (Emily Watson) and goes away to the woods to practise. He accidentally marries Emily (Bonham-Carter) a Corpse Bride. The remainder of the film focuses on whether he can undo this and indeed whether he wants to undo it.The films visuals are great, there's plenty of gags and the script and story are both nicely played. I always tend to find Burton's films strangely uplifting considering the raw story lines and this is no exception.",6,1,3,30 October 2005
Forrest Gump," Overrated feel good movie
","This is possibly the most overrated film of recent times. The film follows the fortunes of Forrest Gump. Forrest is simple, but manages to have an impact on American history throughout the 50's, 60's and 70's. The film is an American dream and yet something tells me that America is the least likely place for Forrest to be a success. American culture is all about conforming to the norm and Forrest simply wouldn't be tolerated in real life.",5,2,7,23 December 2003
Gone Baby Gone," A fine debut for Affleck
","I noticed Gone Baby Gone had received fairly positive reviews from the critics, so I decided to go and check it out. It's the directorial debut for Ben Affleck and he's crafted a fine movie. The key casting is his brother Casey as Patrick Kenzie who is a private detective. A high profile child abduction case leads to him being hired to investigate on the basis that the fellow locals are more likely to speak to him than the police.I really enjoy films that make you consider your own values and prejudices and this film falls very much into that category. It's a very fine film and it's only the rather contrived conclusion to the film and the somewhat pointless female partner in life and business that spoils a perfect 10. With Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris providing support you are guaranteed a good cast and Casey does well to take the acting honours. Fine film!",7,1,2,18 June 2008
Ant-Man," Enjoyable
","First of all I have to confess to not being a fan of Marvel Comic movies. I know some people are very much into the genre, but a lot of the Marvel movies leave me somewhat cold. Having said that I have to confess that I certainly enjoyed Ant Man.The thing that was personally enjoyable to me was the fact that Ant Man is a very fallible character. I will leave it to everybody to discover what his powers are, but the title of the movie gives a bit of a clue. I have to say that I like Paul Rudd as an actor and he is certainly very good in this movie as the lead character Scott Lang or Ant Man. You certainly feel very involved with the characters of the movie and the time fairly zips along.The credits at the end of the movie leave an opening for a sequel and it's certainly one that I will look forward to.",6,4,12,30 August 2015
21 Jump Street," Funny!
","I didn't know too much about this film prior to seeing it. The buzz on the web was favourable, but the same could be said about 'The Hangover' which didn't really live up to the buzz.The plot of the film follows 2 new police officers who are struggling in their jobs. Schmidt and Jenko had different experiences at high school with Jenko being the popular athlete and Schmidt being the unpopular nerd. They are allocated on a job that requires undercover work at the high school and they are required to pretend to be students. They find the high school environment is much changed from how they remember it for real. The comedy is great throughout and it's a real feel-good movie. A great way to spend a couple of hours and put a smile on your face!",6,2,3,22 April 2012
American Hustle," Acting Oscars?
","I'm writing this a few hours before the Oscar award ceremony. American Hustle is nominated for all the acting categories and I've got to say that this is no surprise. The acting is truly fantastic throughout. The same is true of the actors who didn't get an Oscar nod such as Jeremy Renner.The film follows the relationship of Irving(Bale) and Sydney(Adams) who are small time con artists. They are forced to work in a more dangerous area by the FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Cooper). The opening scene of the film, must be one of the funniest of recent years. As for the Oscars - I would love Christian Bale to bag the best acting Oscar because he is truly awesome in this movie. We'll find out in a few hours!",8,0,6,2 March 2014
The Godfather: Part II," The greatest movie sequel
","It must have seemed like a recipe for disaster. Following on from one of the most acclaimed films of all time a follow up without the principal character from the first film. But this film confounds the expectations by being the greatest sequel of all time.This film is told in two strands. One strand continues from where the first finished with Michael now head of the family. Al Pacino puts in another outstanding performance and it is quite amazing that he didn't get an Oscar for either his performance in this or the original Godfather. Michael has a plan to make the Corleone family a legitimate business, but is thwarted by the code of conduct.The other strand tells the story of Vito's early life and features Robert De Nero in the part of Vito. Vito is packed off to America as a young boy to escape certain death at the hands of the local Don. He takes on a new identity and soon kills Don Fanucci because he thinks he is not looking after his own kin.The greatest sequel of all time with another fantastic script. If only films could be this good all the time.",9,0,1,23 December 2003
The Bourne Ultimatum," The best episode 3 of 2007
","This year has been the year of the 3rd film for movie franchises. This is quite simply the best of the bunch and is also one of the best films of the year.Greengrass must be responsible for this and the direction is excellent throughout. The film has a number of chase scenes, but unlike so many Hollywood chase scenes the audience are engaged and interested in the outcome. It really is quite thrilling viewing at times. Matt Damon does a fine job as Bourne and the supporting cast are also good. Lets hope that this is the final Bourne, since it's a great trio of films. I can't think of many other trilogy's that are as consistent throughout.",7,1,2,4 September 2007
Fargo," Classic Coen
","Without giving the plot away, I can still remember watching this at the movies and squirming at the conclusion of the movie when I realised what was happening.This was the first film where William H Macy came to my attention and I found his performance wonderful. He play Jerry who is a car salesman who hatches a plan to extort money from his father in law by hiring two kidnappers to kidnap his wife. The problem comes when the two kidnappers are loose canons and Jerry rapidly loses control of the situation. Marge (McDormand) plays the police chief investigating the various crimes and is also heavily pregnant. The Coen's sneakily promoted that this film was a true story or based on a true story. Fortunately this wasn't true and the film is gripping throughout with several excellent performances. 9/10",8,1,2,12 August 2004
Rush," Great film
","First of all can I say that I'm not a massive fan of formula 1. The good thing about Fast is that you really don't need to know much about he sport to enjoy it. The film is all about the rivalry between two men that are both talented, but with totally different personalities. In the case of Rush the two men in question are James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Their rivalry is similar too many others in formula one history. It is the classic battle between the racer who lives on the edge and the driver who accumulates points by not taking risks to ensure finishing in every race. The personalities of Hunt and Lauda reflect their driving styles. Their rivalry is bitter and personal and the film focuses on the world championship in the 1976 season. The film is gripping and emotional. It is edge of the seats stuff. I for one wouldn't be surprised to see a few nominations in the awards season.",8,2,3,6 October 2013
The Aviator," A pity this wasn't the extended edition
","It seems that the Aviator is heading for Oscar glory this year, but if it does win I suspect it will be more of a nod to Scorsese's body of work. This is not to say that this is a bad film and it would have really deserved it's likely Oscar success had the majority of the first hour been saved for the extended edition DVD.The film focuses on the early years of Hughes especially his love of flying. His fight against mental illness is also dealt with and most people familiar with 20th century history will know where the story is leading. DiCaprio puts in a reasonable performance in the lead and is well supported by the rest of the cast including the excellent John C Reilly.Once the film gets into stride it's gripping during the second act. If you turn up for the screening about 45 minutes late you'll see a really excellent film.",6,0,1,16 January 2005
Léon: The Professional," An unusual friendship
",Leon is the story of a friendship that develops between a hitman Leon and a 12 year old girl called Mathilda. A corrupt government official slays the young girls family including her young brother who is the only one she  was particularly close to. She vows revenge for her brother and learns the ropes from Leon.This is a very well directed and acted film. It's strange to see Natalie Portman is her pre Star Wars days and she proves here that she can certainly act. It's a shame that hasn't shone through to the Star Wars films yet. Jean Reno is excellent as the lead character and you can't help but think that hit men probably are as lonesome as Leon in real life. Gary Oldman is also excellent as the corrupt agent in a role that he's pretty much made for. Great Movie 9/10,8,0,1,15 February 2004
Oblivion," Pretty Bland
","When Tom Cruise was at the height of his career he seemed to alternate between playing a blockbuster (eg. Top Gun, Jerry Maguire) role and playing a serious (eg. Magnolia, Rain Man) role. He seems to be somewhat out of fashion these days and he probably has much less choice over the films that he does. Oblivion is a paint by numbers sci-fi movie. It isn't terrible, but there's very little in the script that you will not have seen in other movies. Cruise plays Jack who is one of the few remaining drone operators who are left on earth. The rest of the population have left earth behind and gone to live on Titan. This followed a war with Aliens over earths resources which we eventually won, but at the cost of the planet.The supporting cast includes a couple of scenes with Morgan Freeman which aren't very convincing. Some of the effects are quite good and liked the performance of Olga Kurylenko as Jack's sidekick. By no means the worst film I've ever seen, but not that memorable.",5,2,6,30 April 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," Watch the real thing
","Finally got around to seeing Bohemian Rhapsody. Instead of watching the movie at a theatre when it came out I decided to watch the real thing. I am of an age where I can remember sitting down to watch Live Aid. I wasn't a massive fan of Queen and they were just one act in the lineup of the best music acts on the planet that day. As acts came on and played their 30 minute sets starting from noon it was incredibly flat. Regardless of how popular the acts were they couldn't project themselves on such a big occasion. By evening it was frustrating just how poor the day was. Enter Freddie Mercury who turned everything round with one of the great live performances of all time. Maybe that gives a hint of why I wasn't jumping to watch this film. It couldn't live up to the real thing.And it doesn't. Whilst there's no doubt that Remi Malek puts in a great performance he isn't Freddie Mercury. The movie was a little too kind for my liking. Pretty sure Freddie Mercury will have been a lot wilder in real life. It's worth a watch, but make sure you take a look at the real thing if you enjoy this.",6,1,1,23 October 2019
Baby Driver," Hidden Gem
","I've called this movie a hidden gem as it came very much under the radar for me with very little hype.The movie tells the story of a getaway driver with extraordinary driving skills. Baby is played by Ansel Elgort who owes a debt to crime lord Doc played by Kevin Spacey. Unlike so many movies you feel empathy and understanding with most of the lead characters. The action takes centre stage, but the plot and script are not just an afterthought. The actors look like they are enjoying their roles and it is a really entertaining ride. Definitely worth checking out.",7,3,8,29 August 2017
The Matrix Revolutions," Not much better than Reloaded
","Let's be honest, reloaded and revolutions were a single film split into two for no other reason than to make more money. It is certainly true that we had enough material in the two films to make a reasonable sequel. More to the point we had enough material to make a film that could quite easily live in the same company as Show Girls and Battlefield Earth. The dialogue is so unbelievably pompous and serious it is frequently quite unintentionally funny. The highlight must be the 'I can tell from your face' line delivered to Neo. I never really noticed a single change in facial expression from Keanu throughout the movie. I'm quite sure that word of mouth will kill off this film quite quickly. The only people I'd recommend this film for are the people that enjoyed reloaded. Some of the action sequences are good, but overall you suspect this would have been far better if they'd only been given half the budget. It makes you realise just how good the original was.",2,0,0,5 November 2003
Man of Steel," A good start
","I must confess I'm getting a bit lost as to where we're up to these days with all the movie franchise reboots. This was the first of the new Superman movies. I have seen it in both 3d IMAX and 2d normal. Apart from a couple of scenes I can't say that the 3d IMAX really made a big difference visually.For the time being Superman is Kal-El and played by Henry Cavill. Sure most people will be familiar with the background story of how Superman came to arrive on Earth. In this movie he is followed by General Zod in a quest for revenge and to transform earth into a Krypton like world.Personally I liked the scenes of Clark Kent as a youngster with father Jonathon (Kevin Costner) the best. The whole movie and the finale in particular will be real eye candy for the adrenalin junkies, so if that's what floats your boar go and see man of Steel.",5,0,2,28 June 2013
21," Check this out before going to the casino
","I saw a television programme some time ago that told the story of the college campus kids that 'won' lots of money from Casinos around the world. This film is clearly based on this story although I do not know how much of the background story is true.The bizarre thing about the story is that even though the group are clearly highly intelligent the system is remarkably easy. It revolves around counting cards on a blackjack game and allocating points according to each of the cards that is dealt. Low cards are given -1, mid cards 0 and high cards are +1. Once the score rises to a certain figure the odds suddenly favour the player rather than the dealer. You aren't guaranteed to win each time, but if you only play at these points you will win over time.The film is about the relationships between the group and I cannot say how much of it is true, but it's a fairly entertaining couple of hours.",6,0,0,10 August 2008
The Revenant," For your consideration
","As usual with movies I went into the movie with little or no knowledge about what the movie was about. The only thing I knew before seeing the Revenant was that it was hotly tipped for Oscar success. I'm sure most of the star actors must be teased about considering whether roles may earn them Oscar glory. Can't imagine that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't start drafting up the Oscar speech as he read the script for the Revenant.To be fair there's no doubt that DiCaprio is very good in this movie and the fact that he's never won an Oscar before must make him a shoe in for best actor this year. He plays Hugh Glass struggling for survival in the early part of the 19th century. There's no doubt that it's an epic journey, but not one that I could ever really engage in. Couldn't help throughout thinking throughout the film that DiCaprio's next line was going to be be 'please give me an Oscar, so I don't have to go through this again'. For me it's a worthy film, but not one I'll be watching again anytime soon. Guess that sums up most films that the academy likes.",5,0,2,15 February 2016
Bridge of Spies," Classy film
","I have to confess to knowing very little about Bridge of Spies before the opening credits rolled. Going from the title and Tom Hanks presence was expecting a thriller, but it's actually a docu drama. The film tells the tale of events from the cold war. Like most docu dramas it suffers from the need to spice up a few of the real life events, but judging from other comments on the web most of the main plot lines are true.Hanks plays James B Donovan who is a lawyer hired to defend a Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). The film is always at it's best with the interplay between Donovan and Abel. A few of the scenes could probably have been dealt with a little more harshly in editing. As ever Hanks is always very watchable though, so it's certainly well worth a watch and gives a sense of what life was like during the cold war.",6,1,2,22 December 2015
American Psycho," An apt title
","I'm not sure whether 9/11 had anything to do with the quality of movies being churned out of Hollywood, 	  but films seem to have dipped in quality since. Whilst American Psycho may not be a classic it is certainly bold, 	  brash, exciting and even makes you think. Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman who works on Wall Street by day 	  and is a serial killer by night. Never as the business card seemed quite as interesting as it does in this movie, 	  but if we are so interested in business cards isn't that a damning condemnation about the rest of our life ? The film 	  mixes comedy and horror quite skillfully and you never quite know what is coming around the corner.",7,0,1,1 December 2003
North by Northwest," Hitchcock's finest hour
","North by Northwest is my favourite Hitchcock film. Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is a clean cut Mummy's boy with few vices. He is mistakenly identified as George Kaplan who Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) wants to see the back off.All the classic Hitchcock plots are here. Thornhill is the ordinary guy that is thrown into an extraordinary situation. Eve Marie Saint is the beautiful blond Eve Kendall who falls for Roger and ends up in grave danger. Vandamm is the sinister bad guy who gets his sidekicks to do the dirty work.The set pieces in this movie are truly memorable. The UN, crop dusting and Mount Rushmore scenes are breathtaking both visually and for raw suspense. The casting, acting and soundtrack are all excellent and as usual the best plaudits should be saved for Hitchcock. This is a master on top form. 10/10 !!",10,2,4,18 February 2004
Doctor Zhivago," A fine epic
","Another masterpiece from Lean and whilst it might not reach the heights of 'Laurence' it can be mentioned in the same sentence. Set at the time of the Russian revolution it follows the lives of Yuri and the eventual love of his life Lara. Their time together is very limited, but all the more special for it.The performance of Julie Christie as Lara is superb and probably one of the finest female leads ever. I'm not sure who won the best actress award that year, but I suspect it was an injustice. Just back from research and Julie Christie did win the best actress oscar, but for another film. Obviously a career year for Julie.",6,2,5,22 December 2003
"I, Robot"," Film making by numbers
","Having seen a few trailers for 'I, Robot' I made the informed decision to give it a miss. I was somewhat surprised to find a generally favourable critical response to the film, so decided to give it a chance. I must admit that I wish I'd stuck to my former decision. You need to be seriously into the sci-fi genre (or Will Smith) to really enjoy this film.Set 31 years in the future Chicago seems to have undergone a dramatic change. The city is inundated with robots which make humans more or less redundant. Although these robots are programmed to ensure they can never hurt humans we all know that this is not going to work. It seems that we must have become a much more trusting race during the next 31 years because only Spooner (Smith) seems to question whether the robots can break their 3 rules.The cast do their best, but it's a shame we couldn't lose a bit of Smith in favor of Cromwell. Even though it's got a few moments that will make you squirm a bit it isn't a bad film - it's just very average. 6/10",5,0,0,12 August 2004
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Possibly the best Spider-Man movie
","There has been a number of attempts at Spider-Man on the large screen, but they have been a bit hit and miss. Glad to report that this movie certainly bucks that trend and is undoubtedly my favourite spider-man movie.This is an animated movie presented very much in line with the comic book origins. The best thing about the movie is that it has a heart. There are quite a lot of characters appearing, but you get an insight and understanding of all of them. You can understand the motivations behind the action which makes it much more of an enjoyable watch. This is certainly very watchable movie for an adult audience as well as the kids.",6,4,14,4 January 2019
American Beauty," Not the usual fayre for a Best Picture
","It's quite possible that this film has totally changed peoples attitude to life. This film is about 	  rebelling from a conventional lifestyle. The film follows a year in the life of Lester Burnham in which he 	  is reborn and eventually dies. Although the families portrayed are dysfunctional these are all people we 	  know. Bearing in mind the imagined and eventually real liaisons between Lester and Angela it is a bit 	  surprising the film got an academy award. The direction from Sam Mendes is on the mark, but you can't help 	  but wonder if he will become another Oscar Welles.",8,0,1,1 December 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Arnie's back
",I always tend to avoid reviews prior to watching films and this really payed off with T2. The opening sequence is very much more dramatic when you have only seen the first film and don't know anything at all about the second film.It's about 10 years after the first film and John Connor (Furlong) is a young boy living with foster parents. Sarah (Hamilton) is in a mental institution as she struggles to come to terms with her knowledge of the future. This time we have two terminators sent back in time representing the machines and the resistance. Technology has moved on and whilst this was groundbreaking in it's time it now looks slightly dated. The directors cut special edition doesn't really add too much to the thatrical release and makes it seem slightly slow at times. Hamilton takes the acting awards with a good performance as Sarah. 8/10,6,0,3,10 April 2004
Edward Scissorhands," Classic modern fairy tale
",A modern day fairy tale which takes you back to watching disney movies with your parents. You can't really imagine any other actor playing the role of Edward Scissorhands than Johnny Depp. It's also probably Winona Ryder's performance outside of Heathers. I suspect there's also a lot of meaning to the film since it deals with someone that doesn't fit in. His desire to fit in and other peoples reactions to him are the cornerstone of the film. In some ways this is not dissimilar to the Hunchback of Notre Damme which has a similar metaphor.,7,0,0,22 December 2003
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," I wanted to enjoy this more than I did
","I have read the Millennium books and seen a couple of reviews saying the film was quite different to the books. Although there are a couple of plot changes these are quite minor and I thought the film was pretty faithful to the book. The slight problem you have when you read the book that a film is based on is that you have already imagined what the characters and scenes should look like. You therefore can't help but go through a check-list as you watch the film. In terms of the lead actors there's no doubt that Rooney Mara is excellent playing the role of Lisbeth. She has had a very traumatic upbringing which will be expanded upon in the next couple of films. Daniel Craig is reasonable as Mikael and the supporting cast are also reasonable. There are some very difficult passages in the book and true to form Fincher hasn't shied away from these in the film. I noticed a few people in the audience were a little uncomfortable with some of the graphic sex scenes. The overall tone of the film is very monotone/dark and there's no doubt that this isn't accidental.Overall I quite enjoyed the film, but couldn't help but think that I should have enjoyed it more. The film would have been better if they cut out 20 minutes or so during editing. The ending in particular was a little bit weak.",5,6,11,30 December 2011
Being John Malkovich," The definition of Off-Beat
","This is a very original movie and it's always good when you see something original coming out of Hollywood. The film also manages to make Cameron Diaz look unattractive - amazing !! John Cusack must be one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood and he puts in another fine performance as the puppeteer. When he starts a regular job he finds a portal into John Malkovich. Now this will not be everybody's cup of tea, but if you like off-beat films this is for you.",7,0,1,1 December 2003
Jarhead," Nothing new here
","When I first heard about this production I had quite hopes of seeing something fresh. I was therefore disappointed in the end result now the movie has finally hit the UK. I think the movie doesn't know whether to be an intelligent independent style movie or a full on studio blockbuster. The real problem I had with the movie is that it's very hard to have any real feelings for any of the characters. You are therefore left feeling rather cold throughout the movie.The movie follows a few marines during the first gulf war. We follow them from their original training through to the conclusion of the war. I believe this has been touted as an anti war movie. I had difficulty in seeing exactly where this point was made, but there again maybe our 24/7 television news culture is probably making most of us in the west somewhat desensitised to violence.This isn't a bad movie it's just not in the same league as Full Metal Jacket which really does shock you into a reaction.",5,0,2,22 January 2006
Shrek Forever After," A money making exercise
","The first Shrek movies were full of fun and adventure. The third film was disappointing and it seemed it was time to put the franchise to bed. The recent explosion in 3d movies obviously made the production company see an opportunity to make some money from a 3d Shrek instalment.The biggest problem with Shrek forever after is where to go with the franchise. The opening sequence of the movie see's shrek in domestic bliss but longing for his former life. The stupor is a fairly good analogy for the film itself. Shrek is taken to an alternative world where he hasn't met any of his friends, but although there are some good moments you long for the adventure of the first 2 Shrek films.",2,2,4,25 September 2010
Collateral," Slick not special
","Mann is one of the premiere movie makers of today. I can't help but think that he's slightly more interested in the craft than the end product. It's hard not to be impressed by this visually, but the script and arguably the acting are not to the same standard.The story is almost solely about the interactions between Vincent (Cruise playing the bad guy for a change) and Max (Foxx) who is a mild mannered taxi driver. The longer he spends with Vincent the more streetwise Max becomes, but this doesn't quite ring true, since I'm sure any taxi driver that's worked for 12 years will have had a few nasty moments.This film makes LA look far more beautiful than it really is and it's quite clear that Mann loves the place. If the acting and script were up to the standard of the photography I'd give this a 10 but as it is I'll give it 7/10.",5,4,7,25 September 2004
Dunkirk," Disappointing
","Finally got to see Dunkirk last night. Having seen the reviews and IMDb score was expecting to see one of the movies of the year. Have to say that I found it hugely disappointing. There is absolutely no doubt that this is a very good film from a technical viewpoint. The cinematography and action cannot be faulted. However, I go to movies to be excited by the journey of the characters. There was very little put into the characterisation of the cast. There is no doubt that actors such as MArk Rylance are excellent, but their talent was totally ignored in this production. If you want to see a movie which knocks you out with the realistic feel of war then this is for you. If you want to see a movie that is full of interesting characters and story then definitely tune into something else.",4,5,7,30 August 2017
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A new yardstick for movies
","The Potter series is undoubtedly aimed at the 8-14 age range. I've no doubt that anyone in this age range will measure the films of the future against these films. I've no doubt I'll be castigated for saying this, but I don't think the films work for adults. Ignoring the excessive use of cgi ,I suspect that this is mostly down to the wooden acting of the three leads. Strangely, I've started siding with Malfoy who seems much more sympathetic than the aloof Potter.Anyway a prisoner is on the loose in the latest outing with a link to HP's tragic past. The measures taken to protect Hogwarts seem far more dangerous than the prisoner. There's lots of fantasy thrown into the pot and I've no doubt that the target age range will be totally spellbound.
Some of the older actors put in nice cameos, but overall the film is never compelling. 6/10",5,1,1,22 June 2004
Ratatouille," Good rather than great
","I suppose any Pixar film has the unenviable task of living up to the previous movies from the production company. The Toy Story movies are the gold standard and equally fantastic for both children and adults.Ratatouille follows the adventures of a rat who befriends a cleaner at a restaurant which has seen happier times. The rat is a frustrated cook and it gets the chance to prove its skill via the cleaner. The film is a little long and drags a bit at times - That's the adult perspective and I suspect some children would also be restless at times. As ever with Pixar some of the visual are stunning especially the cityscapes of Paris. Not in the same league as Toy Story, but still fairly entertaining.",6,4,9,24 October 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man," Pretty Enjoyable
","I must confess to being a fan of the previous Spider-man franchise with Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. The first 2 movies were very good and although the third was a bit of a let down I was still looking forward to the next instalment.It came as a bit of a surprise when the franchise was rebooted with Garfield and Stone taking the lead roles. The feel of the Amazing Sprider- Man is very similar to the earlier movies with the romance between the leads being a fairly important focus of the film.Overall the film is fairly enjoyable. Not sure what the 3D version was like, but some of the special effects looked ropey on the normal screen. It is way better than the last Spider-man film, but not quite as good as the first couple of the Maguire/Dunst films. Still fairly enjoyable though and worth a watch.",5,0,4,19 July 2012
The Lego Movie," Great Fun
","I'm not sure whether it is good or bad, but there were no kids at all in the theater when I watched the Lego movie - It was the last screening of the day and there weren't too many adults around either. I saw the 2d version of the film, but suspect the visuals may have been even more impressive in 3d. The Lego movie tells the story of Emmet who is a very ordinary lego figure mistaken for the chosen one who will save lego. He has to escape the attentions of the evil Lord Business who wants to end the universe and the good cop/bad cop who is tasked with finding him by Lord Business. He is helped along the way by Wyldstyle who recognises that he is the chosen one. The movie is fast paced with loads of action and cameos by numerous faces from popular culture. I will not spoil the surprise by listing these, but the film is great fun from start to finish. I suspect the humour will appeal more to adults than children, but don;t have anything to back up this gut feel. Good fun!!",6,1,2,25 March 2014
Aliens," Is Sigourney more scary than the queen ?
","Much more brash than the original this is the film where Ripley really gets balls. The extended edition gives a little 	  more background, but it's really the action sequences where this one scores. Sigourney Weaver really comes into her own and 	  Ripley is as fearsome as the Queen. Perhaps you best not think too much about the plot though. With lots of nasty creatures 	  itching to kill everybody and the base due to be blown into outer space withing 4 hours Ripley ... goes to sleep. It must be a	  deep sleep as well since even a large glass container smashing doesn't wake her up. Anyway who cares about plot when the action is 	  this good. What a pity they didn't end the series here.",7,0,3,1 December 2003
The Exorcist," Not for the faint hearted
","This is still a scary film today. Some of the effects look a bit dated, but the style of the photography gives it a documentary feel. I suspect the Blair Witch Project borrowed some of it's ideas from the Exorcist. As with most great horror films the real fear comes in the things that we don't see. Regan is a normal child until being possessed and undergoes all manner of treatment from the normal medical community. Eventually it is decided that the Catholic church needs to be brought in to complete the exorcism. Definitely not a film to watch on your own in the dark.",7,1,2,22 December 2003
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Pretty Clever
","The X men are struggling for survival in a future battle against sentinels. In order to win this battle they need to go back in time to stop the original development of sentinels.This is a fairly typical time travel plot. Normally you end up thinking about things that don't quite work with the timeline, but that certainly isn't a problem with X Men Days of Future Past. The film is pretty entertaining from start to finish. I don't think I'm giving too much away to also mention that there's a great advantage to the series in this storyline. If you change things in the past everything is reset for the present - everyone can either live or die and their characters can also be totally different. A great way to reboot a series without having to get a completely fresh cast!! It's a pretty entertaining movie as well as we expect from an X men movie.",6,0,2,17 June 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Solid rather than spectacular
","I've never been one of those people who live and breathe Avengers. Have to admit that Captain America has always been one of my favourite super heroes due to the fact that he's the most normal avenger. Most people know somebody who could hold their own in a battle with Captain America.The movie title gives away the fact that this is going to be Avenger vs Avenger, so rather feared for Captain America. Anyway no real surprise that plot plays a secondary role in the movie to wise cracks and fight scenes. I found the movie entertaining if a little confusing at times. My guess is that the editing removed quite a bit of dialogue and no action sequences. Those people who do love the Avengers franchise will surely be thrilled with the movie though.",5,11,23,25 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Mostly for children
","Finally got to see Fantastic Beasts last night as the new releases haven't quite reached our multiplex yet. Had a feeling that this film was mainly aimed at children and that was certainly confirmed. The stars of the film are undoubtedly the fantastic beasts. Even Eddie Redmayne as Newt is very much the supporting actor to the beasts. Fairly certain that this is exactly the way the kids will like it and quite sure that the 7-13 year olds will love it. The romantic tension between Newt and Tina was also completely lacking and again very much aimed for the younger audience. The script and story play second fiddle to the fantastic beasts, but there's always something interesting going on, so it's fairly entertaining. The people who have been brought up on Harry Potter may also enjoy the film as there are the occasional Hogarts references scattered through the film.",5,5,8,11 January 2017
Jackie," Another great Natalie Portman performance
","I have to confess to being a huge fan of Natalie Portman. Ever since Leon I have always been impressed with her acting and choice of movies.In Jackie she plays Jackie Kennedy reliving the JFK assassination. There is a section of the movie which revisits the TV tour of the White House with Jackie from 1961. After watching the movie I took a look at the real life Jackie and it was amazing just how closely Portman got to the real Jackie. Obviously acting a real life person isn't just about impersonation and Portman brings a whole lot more to the role.The movie isn't exactly a bunch of fun, so if you are after watching something uplifting you should definitely not watch Jackie. If you are after an insight into Jackie Kennedy and a great acting performance then you should definitely give it a watch.",7,0,1,9 February 2017
The Usual Suspects," A modern classic
","This truly is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in recent years. After you watch it for the first time you will be somewhat surprised about the ending. You'll watch it again and marvel at how differently you view scenes on a second viewing. I'm not going to give away the plot, but it is truly remarkable how the same scene will have a totally different interpretation on a second viewing. This is filmmaking of the highest order.The police pull together the usual suspects after a raid in New York. Instead of solving the crime they inspire the group to get together for a little bit of revenge. Dean Keaton (Byrne) is an ex cop turned villain who cannot lead a normal life due to police harassment. He leads the group which includes the frail Verbal Kint (Spacey), Hockney (Pollak) and finally partners McManus(Baldwin) and Fenster (Del Toro). The gang are spooked by the legendary criminal Keyser Soze. The story is told in flashback as Kint is interviewed by police in LA. A film that you can watch over and over again. Great dialogue, acting and especially directing. 10/10 Obviously",9,0,1,5 May 2004
Inside Out," Another gem by Pixar
","Although not without the occasional disappointment, Pixar have been behind many of the best movies of the last 20 years. Inside Out can certainly be added to the long list of great Pixar movies.The plot goes on inside the head of Riley who is a happy child enjoying life in the Midwest. The characters who control Riley are Joy, Fear, Sadness, Anger and Disgust. These characters fight for control and the outside world sees the result of this through Riley's emotions and behaviour.The great thing about Pixar movies is that they are always character driven. Unlike so many movies you really care about the characters. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the movie and good to report that there are a few extras in the closing credit sequence.",8,8,33,16 August 2015
Yesterday," Pretty dire
","Yesterday tells the story of a world that suddenly loses all knowledge of the music of the Beatles. The exception to this is Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) who is a struggling musician who appeals to few people beyond his manager/groupie friend Ellie Appleton (Lily James). All of a sudden he is the only person who knows the back catalog of The Beatles. The film examines how he deals with this, but is mostly a rom/com.The film is pleasant enough, but it's too stupid to really enjoy. To be fair I did hear someone say it was one of their films of the year, so maybe I'm just a little too old and cold to appreciate it's charms.",3,3,7,23 October 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Extremely Ambitious
","I've never been a super fan of Superhero movies. Having said that have seen most of the marvel films. The one takeaway from Avengers Endgame is that it is an extremely ambitious piece of film making. It's unusual that so many of the actors and artists who many people have come to idolize over the years should come together in a film.The film starts five years after Infinity Wars ended. Not going to include any spoilers, but there's a good part of the opening half of the film spent looking into the devastating consequences of Infinity Wars which are very script/character driven. Not surprisingly the second half of the film is very much action based and the 3 hours running time fairly fizzes along. Although it isn't perfect Endgame is definitely one of the best Superhero movies I've watched and lived up to expectations.",6,5,9,8 May 2019
The Commitments," Great Fun
","A comedy about the rise and fall of a band in Dublin. This film is really funny and energetic, but you'll probably need to like the music to really enjoy it. The Commitments are a rough and ready group of kids that get together with an aging trumpeter Joey 'The Lips' Fagan. I'm not sure whether the cast were singers or actors before the film, but they're certainly pretty good at both during the film. The band plays 'Black' soul and the films set piece concerts make the story fairly zip along. Joey tells stories about all the famous musicians he's played with, but is he telling the truth ? When he arranges for a jam between the Commitments and Wilson Pickett we are going to find out ... or are we ?",6,11,18,22 December 2003
Gone with the Wind," The original blockbuster ?
","I can't think of any film of modern times that would have had as much hype as this did during production. The casting sounds like it owed as much to politics as it did to finding the right people for the parts. It's somewhat surprising that they managed to cast so well bearing in mind what pressure they must have been under.The themes of this film are timeless. Scarlett is in love with Ashley who marries Melanie. Ashley obviously has feelings for Scarlett, but never really returns the love. Set in the civil war Scarlett continues to chase a dream and doesn't even notice what she is missing until it is too late. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are excellent in the leads and are well supported. The photography is fantastic even 60 years on. A hit at the box office and thank god they didn't make sequels when this was made.",8,2,4,23 December 2003
No Country for Old Men," A classic Coen movie
","The Coen's have been around for over 20 years now and whilst they may not be prolific they certainly have a string of fine movies. Like most artists there is certainly a Coen trademark on 'No Country for Old Men'. Anybody that has seen Blood Simple and Fargo will certainly not be surprised by the content or style of the movie. The Coen movies tend to have a bit of a contradiction. The films normally feature extremely psychotic characters and a high body count and yet the style of the films is very underplayed. In some ways the extraordinary becomes ordinary and maybe that is one of the objectives of the directors.Anyway as mentioned this is another fine film and quite happily sits alongside their great movies of the past. In the acting stakes Tommy Lee Jones and Kelly Macdonald stand out, but the performances all round are excellent.",6,1,6,5 February 2008
District 9," An intelligent Sci-Fi movie
","For every good Sci-Fi movie there are probably a dozen of stinkers and fortunately this belongs in the former category.District 9 is based 20 years after an alien Space Craft parks above Johannesburg. The aliens from the space craft are 'housed' in a ghetto called district 9. The first 20 minutes are played as a docu drama in the form of news-clips which is wearing a bit thin by the time the film takes a more conventional structure. It is decided to move the aliens out of the city and Wikus is charged with serving eviction orders on the aliens.Bearing in mind that the film was made on a low budget, the effects are quite good. The lead actor Shalto Copley plays Wikus with relish and the directing is also very well done.",5,1,4,27 September 2009
Mamma Mia!," It's hard not to be drawn in by this film!!
",I heard a cynical reviewer give Mamma Mia a good review and I was intrigued to see whether the film could work the same trick on me. This is the sort of film that I'd generally hate. I'm really into intelligent films that make the viewer think. You couldn't get a film that's further from this genre than Mamma Mia. The plot consists of a soon to be bride trying to work out who is her father from three possible candidates that she discovers from her mothers diary. She invites all three to the wedding in order to find out who her father is. That's it in terms of plot.The film uses the songs of Abba as a backdrop and all of the characters launch into renditions of the Abba songs at regular intervals. It's one of the most ridiculously cheerful movies I've seen and the camp/crass levels of the film are off the scale! The amazing thing is that even though the singing ranges from average to appalling (Brosnan has to be heard to be believed) you can't help tapping along and loving every minute by the end of the film.At some point in the future I may well be ashamed of my score/review and come back to make changes. The truth is though that even though the only thing I'll remember in the long run is how awful Brosnan was at singing the other thing that will lodge in the memory is how feel good the movie was. To make my life harder in the future I give this film eight out of ten!!,7,2,4,16 July 2008
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Not as good as rings
","The hobbit movies were always destined to be compared with the Lord of the Rings movies. It's a very tough act to follow and regrettably they are not living up to the Rings movies.Martin Freeman is good in the role of Bilbo, but the plot is a bit all over the place. There are battles every few minutes, but the character development which was so well done in the Rings is largely overlooked in the Hobbit. Consequently the battle scenes which are well done contain very little in the way of emotional involvement. You really don't care that much who wins and loses. It feels like Peter Jackson as got too concerned with the look of the film and forgot a little about the plot!",4,7,11,2 March 2014
Toy Story 4," Another great Toy Story movie
",Like a lot of people I was a little apprehensive about Toy Story 4. The first three movies were fantastic and managed to build on the previous stories whilst being breathtaking in their own right. The third movie seemed to be the perfect end to the story. Another movie smacked a little of an easy cash cow. Whilst it's hard to get way from this there's no doubt that this is a fine movie.The movie starts with a flashback to the days when Andy was still young and we find out the fate of Beau Peep which I can't recall being included in the original movies. We then get into the story of how the toys are fairing with Bonnie who received the toys from Andy at the end of Toy Story 3.Whilst the movie never quite scales the heights of the original 3 movies it's still a great ride. Well worth a watch.,7,0,1,17 July 2019
Batman Begins," An intelligent block buster
","First of all an admission - I was never really a big lover of the Batman franchise. The movies reminded me somewhat of Sin City in that they looked good, but there wasn't much substance.I was therefore pleasantly surprised by the new movie. Christian Bale always seemed like a good casting for Batman and so it proves. The first two thirds of the film really delves deep into the character of Bruce Wayne and how he becomes Batman. It is a rare thing to see a blockbuster paying attention to the script, but that is exactly what happens here. I don't think this is really suitable for young children or adrenalin junkies, but it's great fayre for those of us who like to become involved in a character.The final third of the film is where the special effects kick in, but courtesy of the first part of the film you really do care what happens to the characters. Good movie.",7,0,0,3 July 2005
Meet the Fockers," A classic production movie
","The majority of IMDb users will no doubt shun this movie. The majority of non IMDb movie goers will love it. Is this a contradiction? I don't think so. The bottom line of movie making is to make a movie that appeals to the mass market. The mass market doesn't log on to the internet movie database. To see what the mass market likes check out the differences between the top IMDb movies and the top box office movies.Personally I found this an ordinary movie with a few good laughs. But, I'm an IMDb user so what else would you expect. The person I went to see the movie with wouldn't know the difference between the IMDb and the cia - They loved it.If you're idea of a good movie is something that makes you feel good with essentially nice characters proving that they're nice you'll love it. If you like Clockwork Orange you'll hate it. 7/10",4,0,1,26 February 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Hobbit v Lord of the Rings
",The Lord of the Rings trilogy is undoubtedly my favourite trilogy of all time. The films were based on three books though and felt very natural even if the films ignored some story-lines in the books and expanded others. I was always very dubious about the Hobbit when hearing that it was to be made as a Trilogy. Was that decision based on the merits of the screenplay or based on revenue?The good news is that the first part of the Trilogy was quite entertaining. You can't avoid comparisons with Lord of the Rings and it wasn't quite up to the standards of Fellowship of the Ring. My favourite sequence in the movie was when Gollum/Smeagol appeared. There was also one sequence of the film in a cave where the special effects weren't up to scratch. The film was pretty entertaining and will certainly go and see the next instalment.,5,1,6,19 January 2013
Saving Private Ryan," Great opening
","This movie has a truly amazing opening 30 minutes. We follow Captain John Miller (Hanks) and his men during the d-day landing. A lot of the techniques used during this opening sequence have inspired many other directors since.
The only trouble is the movie has a lot to live upto after the opening sequence. We get down to the main story which is Miller's orders to find Private Ryan and return him home to his mother who has lost all his brothers in the war. Whilst the remainder of the movie is ok and Spielberg shows us why he is a great director the rest of the movie never quite lives up to the opening. 8/10. (10/10 for first 30 minutes then 7/10 for the remainder)",7,2,3,14 March 2004
The Favourite," We'll never know the truth
","Really wanted to love The Favourite, but sadly cant quite get there. Queen Anne is the forgotten Queen of British history. Certainly when I went through school plenty of time was spent looking at Elizabeth 1st and Queen Victoria, but Anne was barely mentioned. As such was looking forward to finding more about Anne from the Favourite as this focuses on the reign of Anne.In particular the Favourite looks at the complex and evolving relationship between Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), Sarah(Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone). Whilst this is very well played by all the actors you can't help but wonder how true to life it is. Something tells me this has been given a 21st century slant to make it more interesting for our current culture. Having said that you do get to know more about Queen Anne and it's well worth seeing the performances of the trio of actors.",5,1,4,4 February 2019
Lawrence of Arabia," Classic Film
","This is undoubtedly one of the great movies of all time. In addition to being a great movie the theme is as relevant today as it was in the period that it is depicting.

Oh and Peter O'Toole is fantastic as Laurence.",9,0,2,2 June 2003
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," How it all started
","I'm probably fairly unusual in that I saw the original Planet of the Apes film during it's theatrical release. The big question that was always unanswered from the original film was how it all started. The Rise of the Planet of the Apes attempts to answer this.I must confess to finding the film quite enjoyable, but some of the special effects/set pieces were a little unnecessary. The plot is quite reasonable and all of the actors seem comfortable in their roles. There isn't a stand out performance as per Charlon Heston in the original film, but there aren't too many Charlton Heston's around these days. I can't say I found it compelling viewing, but it was a pleasant enough way to spend a couple of hours.",5,1,5,7 September 2011
Avengers: Infinity War," This isn't going to be popular!
","As ever with movies, avoided all the hype before seeing Avengers Infinity War. Was rather surprised to see this scoring a 9 on imdb, so guessing my rating isn't going to be popular. I should probably say from the outset that I've never been a super fan of the super hero movies. The plot to Infinity War is pretty much the plot to most super hero movies. The plot is overlooked in favour of lots of action sequences. Personally I don't find much empathy with any of the characters. With so many of the marvel characters on show it's hard not to wonder whether the screen time is being split evenly between the big names. Talking of which I also found myself wondering whether the Black Panther got more screen time in editing after the success of the recent movie.There's no doubting that some of the visuals are dazzling. The jokes wear a bit thin after a while. If you love action movies and/or the marvel universe you will adore this film. It seems that many people who aren't must also love this film, so maybe it's just me that doesn't get it!",5,7,19,1 May 2018
JFK," Make your own mind up
","The film follows the only trial to date related to the Kennedy assassination. Clay Shaw stands accused of conspiracy by the New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison.Whereas the Warren commission report put forward the case for the lone killer theory, the film, or trial to be more exact, puts forward the case for a conspiracy theory. Kevin Costner is excellent as Jim Garrison and is well supported by the rest of the cast.I'm 100% certain that I'll never be 100% certain about the facts surrounding the JFK assassination. I don't agree with the ultimate conclusion of Jim Garrison, but other conspiracy theories and the lone gunman theory are also covered by the movie. It's upto each person to decide what they believe in relation to the Kennedy assassination. In addition to the film people should also do further research before deciding on what they believe really happened. The shooting scene is horrific and is more or less guaranteed to turn your stomach - after all this is real.",9,2,13,12 January 2004
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A classic Tarantino movie
","It seems this film is controversial in the post MeToo times. The portrayal of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and the violence towards women have offended a number of people. I must admit that I expected the Sharon Tate story to be the central to the plot of Once Upon a Time in America, but it is really a side story. It will be interesting to see if the role gets fleshed out in a directors cut. As with most of Tarantino's movies the violence is extreme and comic book like. The violence isn't really targeted towards women. There's just as much violence with the men. You can imagine people being upset by the lack of violence against women if he would have taken that approach.I really enjoyed the movie which is really all about the friendship between Rick (DiCaprio) and Cliff(Pitt). Rick is the television actor with Cliff being his stunt double. They have reached the point in their careers where they are struggling to maintain their status. As ever with Tarantino the dialogue is excellent and it is obviously an age he looks back fondly upon. Both DiCaprio and Pitt seem to be enjoying their roles and for me it is a return to form for Tarantino. Well worth a watch.",8,11,18,28 August 2019
Gone Girl," Great Movie
","Gone Girl is the latest movie directed by David Fincher. Fincher is one of the few directors who can sell a film in his own right after movies such as Fight Club and Seven. It's great to report that Gone Girl can be added to the list of impressive movies he's directed.The film centres around the disappearance of Amy Dunne(Rosamund Pike) who is married to Nick (Ben Afflick). The story is told in a series of flash backs and flash forwards as we gradually get to know all the characters and the circumstances surrounding the disappearance. The first 30 minutes or so is slightly slow, but is important as it gives an insight into all the main characters. The rest of the movie is spellbinding and has numerous twists and turns. I suspect if you stopped and thought about it for a bit some parts probably don't really hang together, but it's so well done nobody (well I guess some people will!) is going to complain about that.Pike is absolutely brilliant in the lead role and manages to outshine Afflick which is quite a compliment!",7,2,11,14 October 2014
Django Unchained," Tarantino back on form
","It's great to report that Tarantino is back to making the sort of movies that you expected early in his career. A lot of his recent movies have always felt somewhat indulgent, but Django Unchained is a return to basics. At times the script is mesmerising and you are totally engrossed in many of the dialogues throughout the film. The film is very much a tribute to the spaghetti western.The film tells the story of Django (Jamie Fox) a slave who is befriended by a bounty hunter Dr Shultz (Christoph Waltz). The main reason for this is because Django can identify the people he is looking for. He soon realises that Django has a skill for bounty hunting and decides he would like to hire him as a deputy bounty hunter who takes 1/3 of the bounty.In addition to the direction being excellent most of the acting performances are also great with Waltz being the standout performer. There's a lot of blood and gore in the film, but it very much of the comic book style.",7,1,3,13 February 2013
The Theory of Everything," Is best actor award justified?
","It seems certain that Eddie Redmayne will be collecting the acting gong at the Oscars in a couple of weeks, but is it deserved?Redmayne plays Stephen Hawking who is obviously very much still alive and well against the odds. It is the type of role that the production company was probably canvassing for an Oscar before filming even started! There is also the difficulty of whether it's acting or imitation. Judging from interviews with Redmayne he appears very suited for the role as he comes across as a very idiosyncratic character.The film is based on the first marriage of Hawking to Jane(Felicity Jones) who has to come to terms with the onset of Hawking's motor neurone disease. It is thoroughly engaging and the two leads are quite brilliant throughout. Having said that I still can't help thinking it's more imitation than acting, but just maybe that's why it is such brilliant acting!",6,1,1,10 February 2015
The Incredibles," Another Pixar crowd pleaser
",Pixar have always had a very adult feel to their movies. The balance has always been quite good between the parts of the film for the kids and the parts of the film for the grown ups. The balance for the incredibles is much more in favour of the adults and I can imagine many kids getting a bit restless especially in the first half of the film.As for the adults this is excellent fayre and slightly darker than what we are used to from Pixar. The super heroes are retired from duty after having a few bad days at the office and have to live through the problems that everybody copes with such as tedious jobs. One of the real oddities in modern cinema is how many of the best characterisations are animated. We really feel for the incredibles as they eventually get called back to duty.Whilst it's not a Toy Story it's still very watchable. 7/10,6,0,2,5 December 2004
A Quiet Place," Not for those with a cough
","Unlike some movies I had seen a little of the publicity surrounding A Quiet Place. It isn't unusual for me to require cough sweets for movies, but for a quiet place they were unwrapped and ready. It as just as well as the movie really is very quiet right from the opening credits.The reason why everybody is quiet is that there are creatures who are hunting based on sound. As with most horror/suspense movies there always seems a lot more enjoyment in the first half of the movie where we are introduced to the challenges faced by people. The movie stars the married couple of Emily Blunt and John Krasinski who also stars in the movie. There is no doubt that the opening half of the movie is very tense and scary. It isn't alone in losing its way in the second half, but the running time is quite short, so it never gets boring. Well worth a watch.",5,2,3,17 April 2018
22 Jump Street," Pretty funny
",Gotta say that 21 Jump Street was one of the most unexpectedly entertaining movies of the last few years. You always wonder whether unexpected hit comedies are capable of a good follow up. In the case of 22 Jump Street it's good to report that this is the case. The two leads Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have great chemistry and are very watchable.This time Shchmidt and Jenko go to college for their undercover operation to track down the murder of a college student which is believed to be drug related. It's pretty funny all the way through with the trip scene being a particular highlight. Very entertaining and looking forward to 23!,7,1,4,27 July 2014
Amadeus," Classic
",I've got to say that I am as captivated watching this film for the 20th time as I was the first. Shot in Prague you really are transferred back to 16th Century 	  Vienna. The film follows Salieri's quest for immortality through music and it is ultimately God who he is seeking to avenge. He does this by murdering 	  Mozart who he can see has been given just such a gift. The star of the film has got to be the music and this totally changed my attitude towards classical music. The 	  directors cut adds a few scenes that mean a few of the original scenes make more sense. This was the role of a lifetime for 	  F Murray Abraham and the rest of the cast and especially Simon Callow are excellent.,9,3,6,1 December 2003
The Hurt Locker," A fine war movie
","I'd heard some good reviews about Hurt Locker, so decided to go and see whether they were accurate. I've got to say that whilst the film isn't flawed, it's certainly well worth seeing. The best aspect of the film is that it makes you consider the current conflicts that Nato are involved in. I will be in the majority when I say that this is largely played out via news headlines reporting the deaths of a handful of national troops. You don't really hear anything about 'opposition' deaths although you always have the impression that they are far greater in number.The film doesn't dwell on the political aspects of the Iraqi war, but focuses instead on the various responses of the Nato troops. The film follows a group of soldiers who are responsible for defusing bombs. Probably the most striking aspect is how little integration there is between the troops and the local population. I would like to think that this was not the case in reality although I fear the film may have accurately portrayed this. I particularly liked the quote 'if he wasn't an insurgent, he is now' following some rather harsh treatment of a local.I've heard a lot of plaudits for Kathryn Bigelow, the director, and these are well deserved. The film grips you from start to finish. Jeremy Renner is very good as the fearless Sgt James. The supporting cast are also excellent, so this is one of the better war films.",6,1,5,11 September 2009
X-Men: Apocalypse," Hard to keep up
","I have seen every one of the X man movies and the spin offs. The last X Men movie Days of Future Past effectively rebooted the franchise. This means that the characters and their powers may not be quite the same as we have come to expect. I suppose this does add an air of unpredictability, but it does mean that you can become distracted at certain times.Anyway the latest X Man movie sees the worlds first and most powerful mutant reawaken. There's no surprise that he's a bit hacked off and in need of restraint when he starts to vent his anger.As is the case with most X Men movies, this is pretty entertaining although certainly not the best of the franchise. As such it's probably one for the fans.",5,2,10,14 June 2016
Ex Machina," Thought provoking movie
","I must confess that I didn't have especially high expectations of Ex Machina. Based on the trailers it looked a fairly run of the mill sci-fi movie. I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised by the movie. It proved to be far more thought provoking than most movies.The story really evolves around three central characters. Nathan has built Ava who is a robot with artificial intelligence. Caleb is recruited to see if Ava passes the Turing test of Artificial Intelligence. The test is to see if the behaviour of Ava is indistinguishable to the behaviour of a human being. Exactly how you can pass this test is one of the central themes of the film. One of the scenes in particular is brilliantly done and really gets you thinking.Unlike many films Ex Machina doesn't cop out half way through and pander to Hollywood executives, so I found it gripping all the way through. All the actors can be proud of the input and it is thoroughly enjoyable movie.",7,2,11,11 February 2015
Back to the Future Part III," Back to the Wild West
",The final installment takes place in the wild west. It is another fine piece of entertainment with Doc Brown finding romance with 	  Clara Clayton which means that Clayton ravine becomes Eastwood ravine. It's probably worth mentioning that a lot of the scenes are replayed 	  in each time zone such as the bar scene. If anyone gets the chance to go to Universal Studios make sure you go on the Back to the Future simulator ride which is the best of it's kind. It's all to do with caring about the characters and you can easily switch off and get into the action.,6,0,1,1 December 2003
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Not for me
","I finally got around to seeing Benjamin a couple of weeks. In case anybody doesn't know it stars Brad Pitt in the lead role of Benjamin Button who grows younger as he grows older. I've always found Brad Pitt a very engaging actor who has put in many fine performances over the years. He probably had eyes on the academy when he took this role, but ultimately his only recognition was a nomination. I was not totally convinced about Pitt in this role and think that Blanchett took the honours in terms of acting.It is undoubtedly true that this is an interesting subject for a movie, but for me it wasn't quite realised. Based on it's IMDb rating it seems that I am in the minority on this and I would certainly recommend that people watch it and make up their own mind.",4,1,2,11 November 2009
1917," Engrossing film
","1917 is a film which undoubtedly would have been ear marked for awards right from it's conception. The good news is that the film delivers on this potential. I'd be very surprised if it didn't win the Oscar for Cinematography and must have a good chance of taking away a few other gongs.The film is set in the trenches of world war one. It tells the story of 2 men who are tasked with delivering a message to the commanding officer of another battalion. The film really conveys just how awful conditions were for the troops involved in the trenches. The film gives the effect of being one take, but there are significantly different scenes along the way. Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are the soldiers tasked with delivering the message. They are excellent in the roles and aren't actors that I'm familiar with. None of the other actors have significant screen time, so if you are going along to see one of your favourites, don't expect them to be in it for long.1917 is an engrossing film and well worth seeing on the big screen.",8,0,1,14 January 2020
Lincoln," Slow start
",I doubt very much whether there is anything left to say about Lincoln. The film focuses on the final few months of his life as the civil war comes to it's conclusion. Lincoln is trying to get the 13th amendment approved in congress that will ban the slave trade. The first hour of the film is fairly slow and the film really kicks into gear when we get to the discussions in congress. Daniel Day-Lewis is obviously very good in the lead role. Having said that it's a very Oscar friendly film and I dare say that anybody playing the part would have been in contention for the Oscar. Tommy Lee Jones is good in supporting role and Spielberg opts for a fairly low key film with very few thrills and spills.,5,1,3,27 February 2013
Children of Men," A disturbing vision of the future
","This film presents a very disturbing future. A mystery complaint causes all the women in the planet to become infertile. Rather than worrying about the end of mankind the planet seems more interested in the death of the youngest person. The world has descended into chaos and Britain is close to being a fascist state. Yes, this is a very disturbing vision of the future, but somehow it didn't ring true. I'm all for suspending belief when I go to the movies, but it just didn't ring true to me. I certainly hope that's the case anyway.The plot is slightly disappointing, but the acting and the action clips make up for this. I've always been a big fan of Julianne Moore and this film sees another fine supporting performance. Michael Caine also puts in a good performance and Owen in the lead role is very competent. Well worth checking out.",5,8,14,23 October 2006
Million Dollar Baby," Fine Movie
","This film certainly deserves the Oscar nomination and to my mind is a better movie than The Aviator.The film focuses on a wannabe boxer who like most boxers is from a poor background. The only difference here is that the boxer in question is a woman. Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) wants Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) to be her manager. He doesn't want to manage a woman, but I don't think it's giving too much away to say that he finally takes her on.One of the best things about this film is that the boxing is realistically shot and the fact that it's womens boxing doesn't feel out of place. Whilst Swank deservedly takes the honours for acting, Eastwood and Freeman are as dependable as ever. The final act is very well played and if you're into fell good movies I'd steer clear of this. 8/10",7,0,0,29 January 2005
Garden State," Not your usual rom com fayre
","This isn't what you'd expect from your usual rom com. If you like your rom coms caked in sugar with honey on top then steer clear of this. If you like an off beat film with lots of angst then you'll love it.Andrew Largeman (Braff) is a an actor who spends his life high (or low in his case) on drugs prescribed by his father (Holm). After returning home for the first time in 9 years Largeman meets back up with his old pals who are mostly equally as unhinged. He meets Sam (Portman), who suffers from epilepsy, and her optimistic outlook on life slowly starts to rub off on Largeman.This is a nicely played film and highly enjoyable. I noticed a review saying that it was equally as over rated as American Beauty and I've got to say it reminded me in feel to American Beauty and Requiem for a Dream. I'm sure it's been said in many reviews, but why can't Natalie Portman put in a performance like this in the Star War films. This is a real return to form for Portman and is nicely directed by Braff on his film debut.",7,1,2,31 December 2004
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," DIffering opinions
","I always avoid movie reviews before seeing a film and therefore didn't realize how much controversy this film had raised. It seems the Star Wars fans are very split about the quality of the film. I am probably in the minority on here who saw the original films at the cinema. Probably in the majority who found Episodes 1-3 less engrossing than the 4,5 and to a lesser extent 6. Episode 7 was a real return to form and therefore hopes were high for Episode 8 The Last Jedi. The storyline of Force Awakens certainly had parallels with New Hope and this seemed likely to continue with the Last Jedi having parallels with Empire Strikes Back. That certainly is the case although it never really lives up to the drama of the Empire Strikes Back. Whilst it isn't a classic it continues the return to form of Star Wars. Whilst Daisy Ridley (Rey) took the honors with her performance in Force Awakens, she didn't seem quite as captivating in Last Jedi. This is offset by Mark Hamill as Luke who steals most of his scenes. It's also the last time that we'll see Carrie Fisher as Leia. John Boyega as Finn is excellent again and I found it a thoroughly entertaining movie. Well worth a watch and looking forward to the next installment.",6,1,5,10 January 2018
The Imitation Game," Great Movie
","I saw this movie early in 2015 and if I see a better movie this year, I will be very surprised as The Imitation Game is brilliant.The movie stars Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role of Alan Turing. Being from Manchester where Turing spent his later life there is obviously a strong connection. The film is mostly focused on Turing's efforts to break the German Enigma code which was a seemingly unbreakable encryption code developed by Germany in world war 2. The methods that Turing employs in his effort to try and break the code bring him into conflict with many people who prefer more traditional methods.The film is also very much about the relationship Turing has with Joan Clarke(Knightly) who he takes a shine too. Cumberbatch is brilliant in the leading role and even though he will lose out (wrongly!)on the major acting awards this year, it cannot be long before he gets rewarded.",8,3,8,10 February 2015
Shrek 2," Pretty Good
","It seems that virtually all cg films are more or less guaranteed to be a hit. I guess it must have been similar with some of the early Disney films. The usp of these films is that they appeal to everyone - Whether you're a snotty nosed 6 year old, a courting couple or newly retired you can't help but like these films. There's something for everybody - For the kids there's the larger than life characters and for the adults there's lots of references to other films and 'adult' humour. For everybody there's loads of laughs.Personally I always find references to other films a bit too clever and distracting from the plot. Shrek 2 is entertaining and is guaranteed to be another box office hit and makes Shrek 3 an inevitability. It is rather good though - 7/10",6,0,0,8 July 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Indulgent
","The reviews on imdb were very encouraging. It is also true to say that a lot of the reviewers consider Tarantino to be more important than the good lord himself.This is not a great movie. The movie reminds me of the weather in England. If you don't like it at the moment, wait for 5 minutes and it will have changed. You never know what you're going to get from scene to scene. The problem with Tarantino is that nobody is having any editorial input into his movies and they are a little indulgent.Having said that, overall the movie is good and would have been very good if it hadn't have been split into two parts to take more money from us punters.",5,0,1,15 January 2004
From Dusk Till Dawn," This is a blast
","This is a great piece of pure entertainment. It's perhaps a bit unusual that my favourite two Tarantino movies weren't directed by Tarantino. This was directed by Robert Rodriguez, whilst True Romance was directed by Tony Scott. What starts out as a classic criminals on the run turns into a vampire movie. So, you get two movies for the price of one and you're out of the theatre in under two hours. The whole cast seem to be having a blast with this and the combination of thrills, spills and excellent script will leave you breathless. Not much of a story, but who cares !",6,1,2,23 December 2003
Jurassic World," This really isn't a good idea
","The original Jurassic Park movie was one of those movies that saw a major shift in movie technology. The actual movie itself played second fiddle to the jaw dropping advance in technology that we saw as dinosaurs roamed the screen. The subsequent movies were always destined to struggle as the wow factor had gone and we could focus on the movie itself. Even 20 years later the dinosaurs don't really look any more impressive. Maybe they would have done in 3d.Anyway as to the movie itself it will not come as any great surprise that the recently opened park is destined for some issues keeping those pesky dino's under control. In an attempt to keep the public in awe the geneticists have created even more jaw dropping hybrid dinosaurs. You have to question with all the issues that have surrounded the park whether anybody would ever consider visiting.Anyway think there was a bit of a love story going on with the same success at chemistry as the dino geneticists. As with many blockbusters couldn't help hoping the dinosaurs would win, but will have to hope they stage another comeback in a couple of years time - sure they will!",5,0,3,13 July 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Typical High Quality Burton/Depp Movie
","I was a nipper at the time the original Wonka movie came out. I loved that film when I saw it and I think it's worked out well because I suspect some parts of the new movie may be a little dark for the real youngsters.This is typical Burton/Depp and very much in the mould of Edward Scissorhands. In many ways Wonka shares the same desire for acceptance that Scissorhands did.For anyone that doesn't know the story, 5 golden tickets are placed at random in chocolate bars with the winners receiving the trip of the lifetime around the chocolate factory. Four of the winners are rather unsavoury characters, but Charlie is the perfect child.With all the usual visual dazzle of a Burton movie and a typically quirky Depp performance it's very entertaining.",5,1,2,1 September 2005
Prisoners," Interesting idea not quite carried through
","I saw the film on a long haul flight which is not the best environment to watch a film. Prisoners follows the investigation into the disappearance of a pair of young girls Anna and Joy from outside their homes. The main focus of the film is the father of Anna, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) who is not happy with the urgency of the police investigation being led by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal).The premise of the film is quite interesting as the parents are obviously desperate to find the children as quickly as possible. They see the police investigation to be very slow and find it extremely frustrating. I couldn't help but think the film could have been better. The film feels like it's been edited to suit the mass market whereas it should have stuck to it's indie roots. That may be the problem with getting big name stars as the money that is handed out to the cast needs to be recouped via the box office.",5,0,0,2 March 2014
Logan," Movie of the year?
","It's still quite early in the year, but it's quite possible that Logan will be my favourite film of the year. For the second time recently went into the movie knowing absolutely nothing about it. During the trailers realised that the film was going to be part of the X-Men franchise. The Logan in the title was Wolverine.The film is set in 2029 and the time has been hard on Logan and Charles Xavier. Logan is effectively a carer for Charles and they are effectively in hiding to a world where mutants are a thing of the past. They are introduced to Laura who is in grave danger and needs to get across the country to a meeting point.The movie is unlike the previous X-Men movies. It focuses very much on the relationship between the 3 main characters. Jackman and Stewart clearly enjoy the movie and are excellent. The real star of the show is Dafne Keen though. It is the finest performance I've seen by someone of her age since Natalie Portman in Leon(or The Professional) many years ago. The relationship between Logan and Laura is also somewhat similar to the relationship between Reno and Portman in that movie. Great film!",8,3,8,31 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Underwhelmed
","I have to confess to being a little underwhelmed by Avengers: Age of Ultron. Based on the box office takes my view seems to be very much a minority view, so if Avengers is your cup of tea this shouldn't put you off.Tony Stark and Bruce Banner are dabbling with software peacekeeping named Ultron. When things go wrong it is up to the assorted cast of avengers to save the world. The script and storyline always feel a little contrived to make sure that all of the characters get their share of screen time. Anyway the script and storyline certainly play second fiddle to the action and those people who loved the previous Avengers movie will love this one! Overall it's certainly a blockbuster franchise that you can't ignore and no doubt the next part will be on our screens within the next couple of years.",5,4,10,9 May 2015
The Insider," Crowe's finest performance to date
","This is a fine film and in my opinion it is Russell Crowe's finest performance to date. Crowe is Jeffrey Wigand a top scientist working for a tobacco company. The senior bosses are not pleased with Wigand and drive him out of the company and then gag him by forcing him to sign a confidentiality agreement.Bergman is a producer at 60 minutes who contacts Wigand and realises he has a story to tell. This is an emotional roller coaster for Wigand who is an ordinary person under extraordinary pressure. Having got Wigand to tell his story Bergman must then fight the corporates to get the story aired. A fine movie and it's electric when Crowe is on screen. It can't be that often that Pacino is outperformed, but he is here and it's not that his performance isn't good, it is Crowe's that's excellent. Gripping entertainment.",8,2,3,23 December 2003
The Dark Knight," Over hyped
","I think those media representatives from the film company can pat themselves on the back for the job they've done with the Dark Knight. The hype surrounding the film has been fever pitch for several months. The furore on IMDb to get the film to be number 1 is a prime example.This is the second instalment of the latest Batman franchise. The sad death of Heath Ledger has led to a clamour for an Oscar for his portrayal of the Joker. Whilst it may be the best acting performance of the film I personally think his previous work was much more rounded and deserving of Oscar recognition.The Dark Knight is a classic summer blockbuster ... all action, but not quite enough substance. I personally enjoyed the first instalment more, as this focused rather more on Bruce Wayne. It seems his Batman really needs to go and see the doctor this time because that voice sounds very bad.It would have been a much better film if one of the set pieces was dropped in place of adding some depth to the characters, but I'm sure a lot of the people who loved the film would violently disagree on that point. This is definitely a film for the adrenalin junkies.",5,14,27,14 August 2008
Everest," Pretty stunning visually
","This is one movie that you should really try and see on the largest screen possible. Really wanted to see the movie on an Imax in 3d, but had to settle for 3d. Probably the first film that's been worth watching in 3d this year.The movie tells the true story of the 1996 season where commercialisation made the mountain extremely busy. The movie follows a number of groups as they plan their assault on the peak of the world.It is probably fair to say that the movie compromises the plot in favour of the spectacle, but the underlying story is still interesting. The scenery is truly spectacular and having been to the top of Kilimanjaro I could certainly relate to the efforts that were required by the climbers. If you can see this on the Imax screen in 3d. It would still be worth watching on the small screen, but make sure you read up about it afterwards.",7,0,1,10 October 2015
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Not a film for younger children
","I must admit that I've never read any of the Potter books, so i've therefore got no great allegiance to the franchise. I expected the movies to be aimed at a very much younger audience, but to my mind these films (after the first two instalments) aren't really suitable for younger children. I have found the darker tones of the films quite interesting and have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the movies.The order of the Phoenix sees Harry Potter fairly isolated at times and the performance of Daniel Radcliffe is quite commendable. With an excellent supporting cast this is probably going to be one of the best acted blockbusters of the summer. I've always found Gary Oldman one of the finest actors and he doesn't disappoint here. One quibble would be some of the effects aren't up to scratch, but isn't it nice to be complaining about the effects rather than the acting!!",6,1,3,5 August 2007
Toy Story," Simply Brilliant
","It doesn't matter whether you're young or old, this is a great movie. Woody is Andy's favourite toy and like all the other toys lives with the fear of being discarded when new toys arrive. He's therefore very worried when Buzz Lightyear arrives. Buzz is an instant hit with Andy and Woody is not very happy. To make matters worse Buzz doesn't think he is a toy and believes he is on a mission. The story really gets going when woody inadvertantly knocks buzz out of the house and the two of them end up with evil Syd who tortures toys.There's lots of adult humour meaning that the parents will find this as funny as the kids. The real winning combination of Toy Story is the characterisation and the empathy you can feel for the animated leads. Although they're not real this is one of the best buddy movies ever made. My personal favourite character is Mr Potato Head because of the dry humour. A classic 10/10",9,0,0,3 May 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An off-beat classic
","I've always had a bit of a soft spot for off-beat movies and this is a classic of its type. This is very much in the mould of Being John Malkovich and I believe it was written by the same guy.SPOILERS WARNING! I had no idea of the story before seeing the film. Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet) share an unlikely relationship with Joel being very shy and Clementine very outgoing. Clementine decides she wants to move on and elects to go through a procedure which will erase Joel from her memory. Joel is devastated and decides to have the same procedure, but does he really want to forget Clementine. SPOILERS OVER.The film is thought provoking and nicely played by both the leads. Easily the best film I have seen in 2004 so far and what a shame some of the blockbusters don't try some of the boldness that makes this film extremely good. 9/10",8,0,1,15 May 2004
Alice in Wonderland," Not one of Burton's better films
","Most people will be aware of the Alice in Wonderland story, but this latest film by Tim Burton takes place with a grown up Alice. Alice is facing some tough decisions in the real world when she falls down the rabbit hole into the mysterious world below.The film is unmistakeably a Tim Burton film, but it isn't really up to the quality of his best films in my opinion. The biggest draw back is that you don't really feel any empathy with the characters. I have been trying to work out the reason for this and have a feeling it may have something to do with it being a 3d film. There are various sequences which showcase the 3d technology with creatures jumping out of the screen. The problem with this is that these shots are virtually always irrelevant to the plot. The film doesn't have a good flow and I get the feeling that if it was edited to remove the '3d effects' and extend the dialogue in the key scenes it would be far more satisfying.I wouldn't go as far as to say this was a bad film, but I feel it should have been better. You could probably watch any five minute sequence of the film and you'd be craving to see the rest of it. The only trouble is that after watching the rest of it you'd probably wish you'd stuck to watching 5 minutes.",4,5,11,11 March 2010
Avatar," Another step forward for sfx
","Avatar has been out for a few weeks now and the general vibe is that the film is better than people were expecting. I must admit when I saw the trailers for Avatar I wasn't desperate to queue up during the first few days it was playing. I was therefore pleasantly surprised when I finally got around to seeing it.Avatar tells the story in the future where the human race are mining other planets. The local inhabitants take second priority over the main task of recovering the resources for earth. Pandora is a moon of the planet Polythemus and Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is sent to take over his dead brothers Avatar. The atmosphere on Pandora is noxious, so humans can only explore by using an Avatar which is a human-navi mix. Jake is paralysed, but the Avatar gives him the opportunity to walk again. Whilst some of the crew such as Grace (Sigourney Weaver) wish to understand more about the navi, most just want to blast them away and take what they've come for.The obvious stand out feature of the film is the technology. This is the first 3d film where I've really felt immersed in the film. It is extremely impressive and Cameron has obviously been fairly obsessive in getting the technology right. There isn't too much of a plot as you can see from above. I enjoyed the film, but I can't help thinking that once the sfx loses it's magic this will be a fairly average film.",5,3,6,12 January 2010
Toy Story 2," Simply Brilliant 2
",The crew are back from the first film and we're about to meet some of Woody's friends. This film is slightly different since Woody and Buzz are now buddies and equally popular with Andy. The underlying theme about toys being discarded is again a strong theme throughout the film though.Woody is stolen after completing a daring rescue mission. Buzz sets out to rescue Woody with a selection of the finest toys. All manner of mayhem ensues and this amazingly is probably a better film than the first. It's probably worth mentioning the cast since it is hard to imagine anybody being more suited to the various roles. I can't watch a Tim Allen movie without thinking of Buzz. A great film and fully worthy of 10/10,9,0,1,3 May 2004
The Artist," A worth Oscar winner?
","Well, in all likelihood The Artist is going to win the Best Picture Oscar in a few hours time. Does it deserve to win it?For anyone that doesn't know The Artist is a silent film that follows the progress of two stars George Valentin and Peppy Miller as talkies are introduced to the movie world. George was a big star of the silent era and Peppy becomes a big star of the new talking pictures. George finds it difficult to make the transition though and his career hits the doldrums.The film is fairly entertaining, but I must confess to loving dialogue in movies. All of my favourite films contain great dialogue, so I found it a bit frustrating that the film didn't contain any words. It is undoubtedly very well done though. Even though the film wasn't really my cup of tea I must confess that it probably does deserve the Oscar for it's originality and execution.",5,4,14,26 February 2012
There's Something About Mary," Pure Farrelly
",The Farrelly brothers aren't exactly politically correct when it comes to comedy. Mary is one of there less offensive movie and it is a pleasant enough way to spend a couple of hours.It's quite obvious that the Farrelly's are as in love with Mary (Cameron Diaz) as the various male leads in this movie. There's plenty of funny moments to keep things ticking along with the police interrogation my personal favourite. Overall a 7/10,7,6,13,15 February 2004
La La Land," Hollywood Escapism
",It seems likely that La La Land is going to continue to pick up a rack of wins during the award season. This alone makes it worth watching as you can either agree or disagree with the awards panels around the globe.For those people who don't know it is a musical that harks back to the classical musicals of the mid 20th century. The main storyline of the movie is the relationship between Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling). To be fair the two leads throw themselves into the movie and there is certainly chemistry between them. To be honest there was probably less music and dance than I expected. The movie is a little too sweet for my tastes and I didn't especially care about what happened to any of the characters. Anyway you need to see the film and see what you think as there's no doubt that a lot of other people rate it extremely highly.,5,3,5,9 February 2017
Saw," A true sleeper
",It's not very often that a true 'sleeper' movie hits the theaters. More often than not the sleeper movies are just clever marketing by the production companies. I think Saw can be rightly labeled a sleeper movie though.I would recommend that anybody who intends to see this movie goes and sees it and stops reading this review now. The less you know about the film the more enjoyable you will find it. It obeys the primary law of the best horror/thriller movies in that the things you don't see are much more frightening than the things you do. The film borders on being a black comedy and is very entertaining from start to end. The film is well acted and nicely directed and keeps up the pace from start to finish. Saw is one of the best movies of the year and will be well worth a second viewing. 8/10,6,0,0,31 October 2004
Up," Another fine film by Pixar
","This was the first feature film that I have seen in 3d. Before discussing the merits of 3d let's discuss the film.Pixar must be the most critically/commercially successful production company of recent times. They have no duds in their back catalogue and a number of classic movies. Up is another fine film and just fails to make classic status although I am sure many people will rank it alongside Wall E and Toy Story. Personally I found it a little bit too sweet although that's a fine line that most of the Pixar movies tread.The film follows the dreams and ambitions of a couple of kids looking for adventure, Carl and Ellie. We see a quick clip of them ageing and putting off that trip they'd always planned to South America. Before we know it, it's too late ... or is it? The great thing about the movie is that you care about the characters. It always seems a bit strange to me that for some reason it is easier to feel empathy for animated characters than real actors. I've put it down to good script writers in the past, but I'm starting to wonder if there's something else going on. Anyway I'm sure most people will love Up and that it will be many peoples favourite film of the year.As mentioned earlier, this was the first film that I have seen in 3d. I can't say it really added to my enjoyment of the film and I can't help feeling that it's a bit of a gimmick designed to increase cinema takings. I've been to several 3d presentations at theme parks, but I think that's where the technology belongs. Maybe there will be a killer app that really showcases the technology, but I don't believe 3d will add much to most films.",6,0,1,13 October 2009
Groundhog Day," Great comedy
",This is a very unusual modern day comedy because it makes you think. Phil Connors is a weatherman on a regional tv station who thinks he is more important than he really is. He is sent off to do his annual report on groundhog day which is something he hates. What he doesn't know is that he is about to endure the same day over and over again.His mood changes from disbelief to elation that he can do anything he wants with no consequences. Once bored with this his mood darkens to depression and even his suicide attempts fail to get him out of the loop. Is it possible for him to escape ? Bill Murray is excellent as Phil and is ably supported by Andie MacDowell as Rita. A warm and intelligent comedy.,7,0,0,23 December 2003
How to Train Your Dragon," A nice film
","I never really think too much about symbolism in films, but I am sure 'how to train your dragon' has a few life affirming messages.It is an animated story that follows the story of Hiccup who is a fairly weedy young viking. His father is the head of the village who are fighting Dragons who regularly come and plunder the village. Hiccup performs terribly during the Dragon attacks, but manages to score a lucky hit on the most fearsome Night Fury dragon which he sees land in a nearby jungle. He goes off to finish off the dragon the next day and gain some credibility within the village, but ends up befriending it.The story moves on from here and is very enjoyable. It isn't too long and there isn't any baggy bits. Very enjoyable.",7,1,3,15 May 2010
Limitless," Not a great movie for your CV
",Limitless is a fairly formulaic Hollywood movie that a churned out by the dozen. It is very difficult to feel any empathy with any of the characters. It tells the story of Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) who is introduced to an experimental drug in fairly unlikely circumstances from a former in-law. The drug helps your brain to work much better and transforms Eddie's life. As with most drugs the feeling becomes addictive and their are serious side effects which is what much of the film focuses on. There's a role for Robert De Nero and I'm quite sure this will not be one of the films that he looks back at with any great affection. Overall it's fairly disappointing and also leaves you (or at least me) feeling quite cold at the end of the film.,3,1,1,29 September 2011
Rocky," The best Rocky
",This is the film that really rocketed Sylvester Stallone's career. He plays Rocky who is a journeyman professional boxer in Philadelphia. Apollo Creed is the World Champion who decides to give an unknown a shot at the title when a leading contender pulls out of a scheduled fight.The film follows Rocky's two key relationships. His relationship with his trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is certainly rocky. Rocky is also keen to woo Adrian (Talia Shire) who is a very shy pet shop assistant. These parts are all very nicely played and it is this that gives the film great depth. The fight scenes are nicely done and whilst the ending might be a bit ott it's forgivable. 9/10,7,0,2,14 March 2004
The Descent," Not for the claustrophobic
",From the maker of Dog Soldiers this film shares a lot of the same characteristics.A group of twenty something women like to live life on the edge. Following from a tragedy after a previous outing they embark on a pot holing expedition. Instead of visiting an easy cave they embark on a trip to an uncharted cave that conveniently has a track to the entrance.For me the film is at its best in the first half that really recreates the (few) joys and (many) pains of pot holing. I tried it several years ago and found it a thoroughly horrible experience. I was therefore squirming at several of the early scenes. Once the cave reveals a few unexpected creatures the film moves into normal territory as the women desperately try to find the open air.If you like your horror films to have lots of blood you'll love this one. It's never dull and well worth a viewing if you ever think about going pot holing.,5,1,3,6 August 2005
Some Like It Hot," Classic Comedy
",I've always really liked this film even in the days when it wasn't as fashionable to like it as it is now. At the height of the depression two struggling jazz musicians go on the run from Chicago gangsters by disguising themselves as women and joining an all female jazz group. Josephine (Curtis) falls for Sugar (Monroe) whilst rich millionaire Osgood (Joe E Brown) falls for Daphne (Lemmon). There's something for everyone in this film with slapstick being mixed with good dialogue. The movie has one of the greatest conclusions ever and Lemmon and Brown in particular are outstanding. A comedy movie that you can watch over and over again. 10/10,9,1,2,10 April 2004
Pulp Fiction," Tarantino's finest Hour
","This is Tarantino's best film to date. Since bursting onto the scene with Reservoir Dogs Tarantino has been idolised by many of the 'serious' movie going population. Whilst some of his films have been over hyped there's no doubting that Pulp is an extremely impressive movie.The movie follows several characters interactions during a (approx) 24 hour period. The time switches backwards and forwards with each scene, so the first time you watch it you will busily be working out the chronological story.   Most of the cast turn in excellent performances and it seems a bit of a shame to highlight anybody. There's many scenes that are spell-binding throughout the movie. 9/10",8,0,2,5 March 2004
Les Misérables," A little bit long
","Must confess that I was a little bit disappointed wit Les Miserables after seeing plenty of hype about the film. As with most films that you are ambivalent towards that is mainly because I never really engaged with the main characters.The film has an excellent cast and tells the story of Cosette, a girl brought up during the French revolution. The entire film is sung with varying degrees of professionalism by the main actors. Russel Crowe is a fine actor, but a fairly average singer and the same is also true of Hugh Jackman. That's a fairly minor gripe though as you soon ignore the quality of the singing and focus on the plot. I felt that parts of the film should have been more emotional than they were. Quite sure that many other people will get very emotional watching the film and will really enjoy it. I just wasn't one of them.",5,1,3,1 February 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Didn't really do it for me
","The one and only thing I normally do before heading for a movie is to check the IMDb score. Had a quick check of GOTG 2 and it scored 8.2 which made me quite optimistic about the movie. Have to admit that it certainly didn't do it for me and whilst I tend to score most movies under the IMDb score, this seemed decidedly average.The things that were lacking for me were plot and script. This can be a problem with quite a few of the blockbuster movies and with the exception of Groot never really found any of the other characters that engaging. Anyway it seems like a lot of people enjoyed the movie, so if you like your Marvel movies it looks like you are in for a treat.",5,6,13,9 May 2017
Titanic," Biggest Grossing Movie of all time
","Whatever people think about this film it certainly had the magic ingredients at the box office. Even after all the Potter and Rings movies it's still grossed nearly twice as much as any other film.I can't imagine many people on the planet don't know what happened to the Titanic. The story is set around the unlikely romance between Jack and Rose. The film is pretty much split into two halves. The first is the romance between Jack and Rose, whilst the second is all about the boat going down. The effects are still very impressive and Leo and Kate look nice enough. Maybe it's not quite deserving of the Oscar glory and box office, but it's still a fairly entertaining movie. 8/10",6,1,3,25 April 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The start of the franchise
",The first outing of the Harry Potter franchise. I've not read any of the Harry Potter books and whilst this is undoubtedly targeted at the childrens market there's still plenty of entertainment on offer.The first film introduces us to the cast. Harry Potter has survived Voldemort's attempt to kill him as a child and is quite a celebrity. He befriends Ron and Hermione as he goes to Hogwarts for the first term. A nice opening film and a good introduction to the franchise.,6,0,1,23 December 2003
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Not for the tiny tots
","I have got to confess that I have never been a great Potter fan. I have never read the books, so my only knowledge of Potter is via the movies. The previous 3 movies were a bit bland for those of that weren't fans of Potter, but this movie steps up the pace, particularly in the final act. I'm sure that the majority of the generation that have been brought up on Potter will be spellbound by these movies. I know there was a few students around me in the cinema who were absolutely rapped up in the movie.This film sees 1 student from Hogwarts in a contest with a student from two other wizard colleges. Harry Potter shouldn't be able to compete due to his age, but the Goblet has other ideas.Has mentioned previously the final act is where the movie really gets going and there are parts of it which are genuinely scary. The film also sees the youngsters start to become aware of the opposite sex which they all find quite embarrassing. I still can't help the fact that I prefer Malfoy to Potter, but the best thing about this movie is that it has made me look forward to the next one.",6,0,1,18 December 2005
The Shape of Water," Great Entertainment
","You can't help but feel that The Shape of Water uses a lot of other films for influences. Although it's understandable that some may find it a little too sweet I really enjoyed the movie.This is Guillermo del Toro at his Pan's Labyrinth best. The film is scattered with several breathtaking scenes. At the start of these scenes you breath in and know that you are about to be wowed for the next few minutes. I've always been a big fan of Michael Shannon and never have his talents been better showcased than the role of Richard Strickland. Sally Hawkins is also excellent in the lead role of Elisa who is a isolated mute cleaner working at a secret government agency. Not for the action junkies, but everyone else should give it a viewing.",7,17,30,4 March 2018
The Godfather: Part III," A good film, but not great
","Whilst never really reaching the heights of the first two films this nevertheless still has its moments. A lot of the critics dislike this due to Sofia Coppola and I suspect that has more to do with her parentage than it does with her acting. Personally I think her acting is fair enough, but I think the film is rather let down by the Vatican plot line.Michael is still trying to achieve is goal by legitimising the organisation. This time it's the younger members of the family that are frustrated and their actions deny Michael's ultimate goal. Al Pacino puts in another fine performance that sees him become increasingly imprisoned in his position. Overall a good movie, but not a classic.",5,1,3,23 December 2003
A Beautiful Mind," A Hollywood portrayal of Schizophrenia
","This is the sort of subject that the academy loves. The film follows the trials and tribulations of John Nash, a genius suffering from Schizophrenia. But, it's a very toned down version of the illness which is suitably overcome neatly for the finish. Russell Crowe is excellent in the lead and lost the best oscar award due to his bitching about the cutting of his speech during the Baftas. Jennifer Connolly and the rest of the cast provide good support for Crowe. This is a good film, but isn't one I would have bought had it not won the best oscar tag. Ron Howard is a very sentimental director and the films ending really is too neat for someone with such problems.",5,0,2,1 December 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Harry's back
",The second outing for Harry Potter. After spending the summer back with his guardians Harry is finally summoned for the second year at Hogwarts. This is slightly darker than the original and shows us what to expect during the next few years.The main three leads do little in terms of character development over the original film. The most interesting character in this is Draco Malfoy who certainly does develop from his role in the first film. It is also quite scary in places and you could argue that the spiders and tree scene are more scary than similar scenes in Lord of the Rings. I'm sure children will have had sleepless nights over those scenes.,5,0,2,23 December 2003
Die Hard," The definition of an action movie
","I guess this film was pulled from a few schedules after 9/11. It's not entirely clear why John McClane should have met his wife at the Nakatomi building, but a gang of robbers disguising themselves as terrorists hijack the building. They reckoned without McClane who turns out to be a thorn in their side and single-handedly stops them.The relationship between McClane and Sgt Powell is a nice balance to the action. This is one of the finest action movies made and has spawned a lot of inferior copycat movies since.",7,1,3,22 December 2003
Jersey Boys," Great soundtrack
","I've never seen the theatre production of Jersey Boys, so saw the movie with an open mind. The first thing to say is that the movie has a great soundtrack. It's hardly surprising bearing in mind some of the songs that the Four Seasons recorded.The movie itself follows the (long) rise to fame of the band and the hurdles they faced. Being from an Italian background the band have to decide whether they want to take their music seriously or fall into a life of petty crime. Vincent Piazza (Tommy) and John Lloyd Young (Frankie Valli)take the lead roles and are engaging throughout. Personally I found the movie a little slow at times and probably would have preferred it if 20 minutes or so would have been edited out. Having said that even when it's slow you know there's always going to be a good tune around the corner.",5,1,1,22 December 2014
When Harry Met Sally...," The Perfect RomCom
","The primary purpose of a film is to entertain. If it happens to make you think then, so much the better. When Harry met Sally will certainly entertain, although you'll probably not need to do too much in the thinking department. This film is a classic of it's genre and it has certainly inspired many other films since it's release. It's almost certainly true that Ryan and Crystal were forever typecast in roles similar to Harry and Sally.The story follows the slowly simmering relationship of Harry and Sally played out over a decade from an unpromising start during the pairs move from Chicago to New York. It's a very warm film that promotes the concept that opposites attract. 7/10/",6,2,3,5 May 2004
War of the Worlds," Spielberg at his best
","Nobody can be trusted more than Spielberg to make a good blockbuster. This is classic Spielberg with all his usual touches. Above all else Spielberg understands the rule that things that cannot be seen are far more scary than things that can.The film doesn't take long to introduce the characters before putting them through all sorts of nasty problems. Will they survive the ordeal? The odds seemed stacked against them, but since it's Tom Cruise who knows. The action is more or less unrelenting with the end being a little rushed. Overall pretty good stuff though with plenty of scary moments. I'm sure the theme park ride will be under development as I write this.",6,2,6,3 July 2005
Love Actually," Sickly sweet but without the honey
","There's no real surprise in the fayre served up by this movie. It's a movie of the feel good variety, but there's at least a few of the characters that don't have everything their own way.The film would have been more interesting if it would have focussed on a smaller number of relationships. We don't ever really get a deep understanding of any of the relationships which is a shame, since it would have been nice to get to know some of them a bit better.Alan Rickman is excellent as the grumpy Harry and his relationship with his wife Karen (Emma Thompson) and secretary Mia is the most complex and interesting  of the relationships. In terms of laughs Bill Nighy steels the show and the rest of the cast all contribute exactly what you would expect of them. There isn't anything outstanding in the movie, but it's a fairly pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. If you like Brit Rom Coms such as 4 Weddings, Notting Hill then you're more or less guaranteed to enjoy this.",6,3,7,20 January 2004
12 Years a Slave," A worthy Oscar winner
","There's no real surprise that 12 years a slave waltzed off with the best film Oscar. The plot plays perfectly for the academy. Solomon Northup (Ejiofor) is a black free man living in the New York area in the 19th Century. He is kidnapped and sold as a slave to the south and the film focuses on his life as a(n educated) slave over the next 12 years. It is based on a true story.The film is always likely to be a tough watch and that was certainly true. I wasn't especially engaged by the main character, but the supporting role of Patsy (Nyongo) is very watchable. The direction of Steve McQueen is certainly good and a couple of the scenes are likely to stay with you for a long time. Definitely not for the feint hearted!",6,0,2,12 March 2014
There Will Be Blood," Anderson is a great movie maker
","Even though there's been a lot of publicity about this film throughout the award season, I managed to avoid any spoilers before the film finally turned up at our local flea-pit. It was certainly well worth the wait and it was great to see a craftsman practising their art. In terms of the current crop of directors (PT)Anderson must be my favourite and I adore both Magnolia and Boogie Nights.I'm not sure whether there is much comment about this, but the opening sequence of the film has no dialogue. You can almost sense that Anderson is playing with the audience and my guess is that it must be about 15 minutes before the first dialogue. I've no doubt I'll be able to check that somewhere on the net.Whereas with Magnolia and Boogie Nights had brilliant performances from several members of the cast There Will Be Blood is very much the Daniel Day-Lewis show. Fortunately Day-Lewis is certainly up to carrying the film and he fully deserved the best actor Oscar. I've no doubt ANderson and Day-Lewis got on well because they are not the most prolific of people in the movies. It's certainly quality rather than quantity for both.In case anybody doesn't know the film follows an oil prospector from the early part of the 20th century. The film is tough going at times and the lead character is not the most sympathetic of characters, but as with most of Anderson's work there are times at the film when you get totally immersed in it. Well worthy of all the praise and lets hope it isn't Anderson's and Day-Lewis' last work of the decade ... Some hope!",7,1,5,12 March 2008
Joker," Not many laughs here
","I haven't seen any reviews of Joker, but I can there is sure to be a lot of comparisons between this and the dark knight. It is probably the biggest compliment to Joaquin Phoenix to say that his performance is certainly comparable to Heath Ledger in the dark knight.The movie is incredibly dark in mood and there are many things relevant to real life in the 21st century. The movie tells the story of how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker. It is a tough watch, but brilliantly shot and acted. The only thing I would question is the playing of a Gary Glitter song.If you are into feel good movies then the Joker will not be for you. If you want to see a great acting performance then you'll be hard pushed to beat Joaquin Phoenix in 2019.",8,0,2,7 October 2019
The Bridge on the River Kwai," I've never really noticed the anti-war sentiment
","Now having banged on about Hollywood likes to rewrite history in other reviews, this is also only loosely based on real events. This is Alec 	  Guiness's finest performance and the film is really a psychological battle between himself and Col Saito. In reality I suspect Col. Nicholson 	  would have been shot early on, but that wouldn't have made a very good movie would it. The direction is excellent and this is the sort of film 	  that just couldn't be made any more without cgi. I have seen comments saying this film is anti-war, but I think the best anti-war films are probably 	  Full Metal Jacket and the mini-series Band of Brothers.",8,1,3,1 December 2003
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," The academy got this right
",The academy tends to honour films that portray physical or emotional problems. In this case the awards were well merited.Randle P McMurphy (Nicholsen) fakes insanity to avoid a stretch in the pen thinking that spending time in a mental institution will be much easier. He doesn't reckon for Nurse Rathched (Louise Fletcher) who is far more daunting than anyone he was likely to meet in the state pen.The two leads are excellent and are well supported by the rest of the cast including a very young looking Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito. 9/10,8,0,3,19 February 2004
Edge of Tomorrow," Everything seems familiar
",On the way into this movie I was thinking that a few of the Tom Cruise movies seem to have very similar plot lines. The Edge of Tomorrow is very much along the same lines as Minority report and Oblivion. The other obvious comparisons to movies in the past are Groundhog day and Source Code. So how does it compare?The Edge of Tomorrow follows Cage (Cruise) as he is parachuted into a future war against an alien race. Rita (Blunt) is seen as one of the best soldiers and one of the people who could possibly turn around the war against the aliens.It is a pretty entertaining movie and whilst there isn't really anything new it's a bit of a blast. Well worth a watch.,6,0,3,27 July 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," A bit disappointing
","I have to confess that I was really looking forward to seeing this movie on the back of a lot of critical acclaim. Personally I found it somewhat of a disappointment!The film tells the story of Jordan Belfort(DiCaprio) who was a Wall Street stockbroker. He was not satisfied with the amount of money that could be made through legitimate trades, so he he used illegal methods to make more money. It follows a lot of the themes familiar from Wall Street, but focuses on the lifestyle that Jordan leads.For me the film was a little too long and completely ignored the consequences of Jordan's actions. It would have been interesting to see the effects that his actions had on other people and I'm quite sure in real life he would have had a few confrontations with people he swindled. There is no doubt that DiCaprio gives a great performance in the lead role and the film certainly made me consider whether happiness and money have any relationship whatsoever. It could be argued that watching the film may well lead people to the conclusion that money and happiness are inversely proportional. I guess you can't really argue with a film that leaves you with that feeling!",5,3,5,5 March 2014
It Chapter Two," Not as good as Chapter 1
","Wrote the headline saying it wasn't as good as chapter 1 and went scurrying off to check how I scored the 2 movies. Don't need to change the headline as scored them 6 and 4. The major difference between the movies is that I cared much more for the characters in the 2017 movie. Consequently it was much more scary to watch than the 2019 movie where I cared little for whether the characters survived or not.The movie is set 27 years after the original and don't think I'm giving anything away by saying Pennywise is back. The movie switches between the two timeline and it is impressive how little the original (young) characters have changed. Finn Wolfhard seems to age in each episode of Stranger things and yet he appears unaltered from the original IT here. Presumably they shot the movies back to back.It's a bit long at 3 hours and it does tend to go for the shocks rather than suspense. If you are really into the genre then it's worth catching, but it isn't an exceptional movie.",4,0,0,24 September 2019
Jaws," Not for swimmers
","This was the film that shot Spielberg to fame. A sleepy seaside resort Amity Island has an unwanted visitor for the summer season. Conscious of the fact that the island needs visitors for the economy they try to ignore the evidence of the man eating shark and go on as normal.The three leads Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss are excellently cast and put in fine performances. It's a bit surprising that Shaw in particular did not even get nominated for the best supporting actor award. It's a true tribute to Spielberg's craft that the head scene is still frightening even though you know what's coming.",7,6,11,12 January 2004
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The journey comes to an end (or a start)
","It's probably fair to say that the Hobbit trilogy hasn't ever reached the heights of the Rings trilogy. There's no doubt that there are a number of reasons for this. The awe of the visuals on the Rings movies is just as impressive in the Hobbit movies, but it is no longer original. There was also a lot more source material in the Rings books than the Hobbit book.The final part of the Hobbit trilogy is action all the way and starts (not unsurprisingly) from where the previous film finished. Don't go and see the Five Armies without seeing (or at least knowing about) the previous Hobbit films. You probably have the greatest interest in the Hobbit movies when the scenes are related to plot lines of the Rings movies. That's definitely the case with me and consequently I love the final scene of the movie. Martin Freeman is fine in the lead role of Bilbo although you never quite get the sense of joy that you got from the Rings cast. The Five Armies is definitely the best of the Hobbit movies and is definitely worth a watch.",6,1,2,29 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The end of the beginning
","I was a teenager when the original Star Wars movies were released, and like a lot of people from that generation have been disappointed with the first 2 prequels. This film gave Lucas a final chance to recapture the magic.I don't think he has recaptured the magic with Sith, but it's a lot better than the first 2 prequels. The first hour is lacklustre, but the final hour at last grabs your attention. As with the previous movies far too much attention is paid to ticking of the checklist that leads to episodes 4-6 and computer generated graphics. Far too little attention is paid to the script which is unbearable at times.Even though Portman (who I rate highly) and Christensen (who I don't) have the least convincing relationship in cinematic history it seems to be deep enough to turn Anakin into Darth. Ewan McGregor at last shows a few glimpses of his quality and easily the best performance in the acting stakes goes Ian McDiarmid. This proves that blue screens and Lucas can't make every actor wooden. What a shame the previous 5 hours couldn't live up to the final hour.",5,0,1,10 June 2005
Inception," Wow - a blockbuster where you need to engage your brain
","One of the worst trends in cinema over the last few years is the number of blockbuster films that have been devoid of plot. The majority of the big summer movies could have a plot synopsis written on the back of a business card. As the cinema screen explodes in front of your eyes, you long for a word containing more than two syllables.Inception is a break from that tradition and for that alone it must be commended. The film follows Cobb (DeCaprio) who can extract information from people by breaking into their dreams. He is tasked with performing the more difficult task of planting an idea into a dream - The inception. He gets together a team of people who will help him accomplish the mission.First the bad news. I didn't particularly feel any emotional investment with any of the characters. The film doesn't really have goodies and baddies in the traditional sense. That is not a bad thing, but I simply didn't care very much what happened to any of the characters.Now for the good news. The script and acting are all first rate. The effects are also very good and you have to say that Christopher Nolan is building up a great cv. DeCaprio must be a contender for next years best actor Oscar and it would be surprising if he doesn't get at least a nomination. The supporting cast are also good and I've always enjoyed watching Ellen Page.The best thing of all about the film is the ending. Pure class.",5,2,5,28 July 2010
WALL·E," Another fine movie from Pixar
","Pixar broke the mould with Toy Story by creating animated movies that are equally as enjoyable for adults as children. They have a craft for making their films enjoyable on both levels. I can only vouch for WALL-E from and adult perspective, but judging by the kids at the cinema they also thoroughly enjoyed the movie.WALL-E is somewhat different from many of the other Pixar movies in that it is much larger in scale. Whereas most of the other movies have been very much individual 'character' based movies this has bigger themes. It concerns a world which mankind have left due to pollution. WALL-E is seemingly the only robot that is left which is busily cleaning up the mess we've left behind. The humans have become grossly lazy on their spacecraft and send down robots to check on the state of the earth to see whether it is inhabitable again. They have been away for 700 years and are waiting for the environment to recover. Some of the images are quite thought provoking and portray a rather bleak version of the future.The main thread of the movie concerns the romance between WALL-E and EVE who has been sent to look whether plant life has returned to earth. As with most of the Pixar movies it's totally engrossing and you really care about the characters by the end of the movie. A very enjoyable movie and as usual with the Pixar movies the short beforehand (Presto) is superb as well. There's nothing to see during the end credits though this time although the end credits are very well done.",6,4,9,18 July 2008
Arrival," One of the best movies of 2016
",Arrival is undoubtedly one of my favourite movies of 2016. It is very hard not to imagine what would happen in real life if we were visited by space ships from another planet. The scenario that plays out in the movie certainly seems plausible.Amy Adams is cast as Louise Banks who is a leading linguist that is brought onto the military operation. She is charged with trying to decipher the communication from the alien craft. Jeremy Renner is cast as Ian Donnelly a physicist who befriends Banks on the team. The pacing of the movie is excellent and you are never quite sure where the movie is heading. Very engaging throughout.,7,2,8,28 November 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," Excellent Movie
","This is a very fine movie that was unfortunately somewhat overlooked when it was first released. Word of mouth and critical acclaim has resulted in the movie becoming one of the best known and loved films of recent times.
The story tells of the imprisonment of Andy Dufresne (Robbins) at the harsh Shawshank prison. Gradually over time he befriends Red (Freeman) who is the fixer in the prison who can get hold of any items at a price. Andy channels his frustration into making things better at the prison. The smallest achievement is celebrated and used as impetus for the next challenge. The film should really make the viewer treasure the things that we all take for granted on a day to day basis. The other interesting aspect of the film is the institutionalisation as portrayed with Brooks. he has been in prison for so long he cannot (and does not want to) survive on the outside. 9/10",8,0,1,14 March 2004
Parasite," If you are going to watch a foreign language film this is it
","I've never been a fan of watching sub titled foreign language film. It may be in part explained by not really associating with people who do enjoy foreign language films. Anyway with it's success at the Oscars, Parasite seemed to be deserving of a watch, so saw it on the big screen a couple of days ago.Stylistically it seemed very similar to a Tarantino movie to me. The characters were gripping and the dialogue was excellent. Would have been so much more enjoyable if I understood Korean though. The movie explores the tensions in the class divide which is obviously a universal theme which everyone understands. The sets are excellent and so realistic you can imagine how you'd feel yourself yourself in the scenes.It's well worth a watch and if you don't share my dislike of subtitles you'll probably love this movie.",5,4,13,25 February 2020
Music and Lyrics," Ticks all the boxes
","I guess this is the definition of a chick flick! Unlike the majority of the male gender I've got to admit that I can quite happily watch rom-coms. Lets be fair Hugh Grant can only play one type of role and this is it. You can't really argue though that he plays the role well and will no doubt play a very similar role in a few months time. I also quite like Drew Barrymore, so this was a good film to sit back and just let it wash over you. I don't think I'd be giving the plot away if I said it follows the usual rom-com formula. In this case it follows a singer who's struggling to rekindle his former glory. It certainly ticked all the right boxes for me and for devotees of the genre I'm sure they'll love it.",5,0,1,13 June 2007
Platoon," Not easy viewing
","Platoon is uncomfortable viewing. The film focuses on Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) who is a new recruit to Vietnam. In the same way that Chris quickly becomes used to the stark realities of war, so do the audience. It is a very powerful film and brutally exposes the realities of war. People die in war and the soldiers become familiar with death. Those soldiers that do survive will not be the same again.Excellent direction for Stone and a good all round cast make for a fine film, but it's probably a little too close to the bone to be genuinely enjoyable. 8/10",7,0,1,19 February 2004
Prometheus," Not as good as Alien
","I tend to avoid film reviews before seeing a film where possible. I did hear that Prometheus was supposed to be like Alien though and there was a lot of discussion about whether it was a prequel. The problem with having a film likened to a classic is that your expectations are set very high. There's no doubt at all that Ridley Scott has directed another very fine sci-fi movie, but it isn't quite in the same league as Alien. As with every film the key thing that depends on your enjoyment is how much you care about and relate to the characters. In contrast to Alien I found that I didn't really care about many of the characters in Prometheus. This means that the action does not really quite carry the same impact.For all that it was reasonably enjoyable and well worth a watch. Just don't expect it to be as good as Alien!",5,4,6,17 July 2012
Wonder Woman," One of the better blockbuster movies
","Although I didn't know the plot of the movie prior to seeing Wonder Woman, was aware of positive comments surrounding movie. Having seen the movie I can certainly agree with the positive vibe.First of all the plot isn't quite what we are used too with a lot of superhero movies. Rather than being set in the future it is firmly in the past. The Wonder Women is Diana who is played by Gal Gadot. There is a real on screen chemistry with pilot Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine) and the plot builds nicely. You care what happens to the characters in the movie and this helps to make the action sequences thrilling. A lot has been made by the lead role being female, but it is just a good action movie. It's quite possible this will be the best blockbuster movie of the year.",7,2,8,21 July 2017
Back to the Future Part II," A darker film
","The second installment sees Marty and Doc going forward in time. They then return to the 80's only to find that they are in 	  an alternate 1985 so they must go back to 1955 again to fix things. One thing that doesn't quite work is Biff's trip back in time. If he did change things back in 1955 when he went back to 2015 he'd return to the changed world. It would be the alternate world that Marty and the Doc experienced in 1985 plus 30 years. This is probably the weakest of the movies, but it is still a good way to spend a couple of hours of your life.",5,1,4,1 December 2003
The Queen," The monarchy survives
","The film is focused entirely on the period of Princess Diana's death and the period upto the funeral a week later. In common with most people from the UK that is something that is very much etched in the memory, so the film does very little in terms of information. I can certainly vouch for it's accuracy although the reaction does seem a little over the top in retrospect.Mirren puts in a fine performance as the Queen and you certainly couldn't quibble about the Oscar recognition. Although the historical content is very accurate it is impossible to comment on the accuracy of the royal characters. The film seems to adopt the stereotypical representation of the royals and it is quite possible this is correct. The royals are so detached though that it is hard to say this for sure.The film is really about whether the monarchy can survive even though they aren't aware they are under such close scrutiny. I found the film quite entertaining and it's really a docu drama. You can also see little indications that it was originally meant to be a TV film. It will not change your life, but it's reasonably entertaining.",6,3,4,5 March 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," How did this do so well at the Oscars ?
","How did this do so well at the Oscars ? I'm not questioning the merit of the awards, just that it's not the sort of film you would expect to walk away with many of the leading gongs. The main story follows the FBI investigation into the series of murders attributed to Buffalo Bill. Clarice Starling (Foster) is a student agent who is sent to interview Cannibal killer Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). During these interviews it becomes clear that Lecter had met Bill as a patient when he worked as a psychiatrist. Will Clarice be able to get Lecter to disclose who Bill is before Bill kills again ? Very good movie with excellent performances from the 2 leads and well worthy of the academy's recognition. 8/10",7,0,1,14 March 2004
X-Men: First Class," One of the better 'blockbusters'
","I didn't enter the movie with high expectations, but must confess to enjoying the latest prequel more than many of it's counterparts.The film starts with one of the scenes from the original movie and then flashes backwards and forwards with the majority of the film based in 1962.Here we find Xavier and Magneto becoming aware of their powers and finding others with special powers. The film is very well scripted and in common with the better films in the X series you really feel empathy or at least understanding with most of the leading characters. As with other prequels you always have a very good idea about what the ultimate conclusion will be but it's a great ride getting there and thoroughly enjoyable.",5,2,4,30 September 2011
The Wolverine," Fairly Entertaining
","The best part of this movie is that we get to see some of Wolverine's inner demons. Unlike many action movies of 2013 it is very much a character driven movie. It does focus almost solely on the one character, but let's be grateful that it isn't all just fights and explosions!The storyline of the movie is that wolverine starts to lose some of his powers. One of the problems with super heroes is that they're untouchable, so it's interesting to see how Woverine copes with being more human. As ever Jackman is very watchable in the lead. the direction is also good from James Mangold. Whilst the plot isn't without faults it should be applauded for trying something a little more interesting than the standard blockbuster fayre.",5,1,4,26 August 2013
Black Panther," Great Box Office
","Finally got around to seeing Black Panther which has been out for a few weeks now. Tried to see it during the opening week, but my regular cinema was the busiest I've ever seen it in the 15 years since it opened. There was no surprise we didn't get in and sure many people suffered similar experience. There is no doubt that the almost entirely black cast and hype certainly packed the the people in. Well done to the guys who marketed the movie.Black Panther tells the story of the secret African society the Wakanda which is more technologically advanced than the rest of the world. T Challa (the Black Panther) is the heir to the throne and the film focuses on the challenges he faces. The plot is a bit clunky at times, but the film is always watchable. The acting is good and the visuals are particularly good. Sure we'll be seeing plenty more of the Black Panther in future years and looking forward to seeing more.",6,1,2,22 March 2018
Blade Runner," A cult classic film, but not for me.
","I've never quite got this movie. I have watched it several times and although so many people think it is a classic it just doesn't quite do it for me. Anyway I know so many people love this movie I can't argue it's status as a cult film and it does make the IMDB top 100 films of all time. I don't dislike the film, but I just don't love it. Is Deckard a replicant ? it depends which cut you watch and I don't really care.",4,10,26,1 December 2003
Monsters University," Well worth a visit to cinema
","This is the latest Pixar film and as usual fairly entertaining. It played along with a short featuring umbrellas which was also fun.Monsters University follows the trails and tribulations of Mike who wants to go to scare school. It is a prequel to Monsters Inc. Sullivan is from a family of scary people and really doesn't get along with Mike when they meet at Scare school.As ever with Pixar there is a great storyline, script and characterisation. You feel like you really know a lot about many of the characters and it's totally unlike many of the real life films which is rather ironic. This will be enjoyable to all the family and is well worth a watch.",6,0,1,16 July 2013
Ben-Hur," The definition of epic

The only thing that keeps Judah alive is a desire for revenge and a return to his former life. Having saved Quintus he is eventually given his freedom. This sets up the epic Chariot race in which Massala tries some real Dick Dastardly tactics, but eventually receives his just deserts. Judah then returns home to find his mother and sister have leprosy having been in a squalid jail for several years. With a couple of meetings with Jesus the film reaches it's happy conclusion when everything returns to normality.",9,0,3,1 December 2003
Casino Royale," Is the new Bond a better Bond?
","I've got to say that I'm not really a great lover of the Bond franchise. Whilst some people were up in arms about the new Bond having blonde hair it really didn't stir the same emotions in me. The old Bond movies were totally predictable and when I heard on the grapevine that the new movie was different I was a tad dubious.Well, I'm pleased to say that the face-lift is good and it's breathed new life into a very tired formula. I can't say that I noticed the blonde hair of Craig and it mattered even less. This is a top notch thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The chemistry in the lover match is good and thee pantomime lines have disappeared. The new Bond is rugged and a guy from the new millennium as opposed to a guy stuck in the sixties.I suppose most people will have one gripe or another. I found the product placements quite annoying, since I started looking for them after the first few. I was also disappointed that the silhouette ladies were missing from the titles. Most of my teenage wet dreams were inspired by the credits, s maybe it's a good job I was a child of the sixties after all. It's just a shame I had to put up with the last 25 years of Bond movies before waiting for another gem.",6,1,3,29 November 2006
Toy Story 3," A farewell to Woody and Buzz?
","I've heard the Toy Story films described as being the Godfather of animation films. I'm pleased to report that the third instalment of Toy Story is much closer to the quality of the first 2 films than the third part of the Godfather.The final part of Toy Story see's Andy about to depart to college and the toys facing an uncertain future as it's time for a tidy up. We have all our old favourites here together with a few new friends (and enemies) that they meet along the way. As usual with Toy Story, it's got something for the adults and the children. If the first Toy Story was the buddy film between Buzz and Woody, the second film was the rip roaring adventure with a few dark moments then the final film is a fairly sentimental goodbye to our old friends. They'll be sadly missed and Toy Story will make a great box set which you'll be able to watch back to back in half a day. One of the best films of 2010 ... even if it wasn't quite as thrilling as the first 2.",8,1,2,20 July 2010
Trainspotting," Seriously Good
","This film along with Requiem For a Dream was quite controversial due to the subject matter. Anybody that likes Rom Com films or other eye candy would be best advised to steer clear of this. For people who want a serious insight into the world of drugs then this is a very good movie. Whilst some people would argue that it glorifies drugs, I would argue that it does the opposite. At times the film is funny, at times depressing, at times optimistic, but at all time engaging.This is McGregor's finest hour to date at Renton and oh what a shame he couldn't instill the same amount of energy into his Star Wars role. The film itself follows the exploits of a group of scottish friends who are mostly addicted to drugs or violence or both. The whole cast are good and the direction is excellent for what must be the best British movie of modern times.",8,0,0,2 May 2004
Jojo Rabbit," Surprising Awards Candidate
","A film featuring Adolf Hitler in a comedic role wouldn't be an obvious choice for the awards season. Jojo Rabbit did feature frequently in this years awards categories though. Not sure whether there was any controversy surrounding the subject matter, but guess it may have been a difficult one to get a green light into production.The movie tells the tale of a nazi youth fanatic Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) and a young jewish girl Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie). The young Jojo daydreams about Adolf Hitler who is played by director Taika Waititi. The supporting cast are excellent and include Scarlet Johansson, Rebel Wilson, Sam Rockwell and Stephen Merchant.The movie was obviously a labour of love for Waititi and it's good that he pulled it off so well. The movie is very funny in parts and also very touching as well. The two young actors aren't overshadowed by their elders and should have a fine future in the movies. Well worth a watch.",7,1,2,11 February 2020
Live Free or Die Hard," A good film is trying to get out
","Yet another franchise film in 2007 - the year of the franchise. This film suffers from the common problem of the franchise, in that it must tick all the boxes that the audience are expecting. If you've seen the previous Die Hard movies then this does indeed tick all the boxes. This is a bit of a shame however, because I really think the film would have been better if it would have played more on the ageing McClane and the relationship with his daughter.It's John McClane (Willis) plus a few incompetents battling against an army of bad guys. In this particular case he's battling against a group of cyber criminals. The plot is quite interesting and the dialogue isn't without merit, but unfortunately some of the action sequences are a little over the top. It's a shame the budget wasn't capped because I think if you took out a couple of the set piece action sequences and replaced them with a little more character development this would have been a very good film. As it is this is going to appeal to the people that liked the previous Die Hard movies and like plenty of action.",5,1,3,15 July 2007
Lucy," Nothing new in Lucy
","Walking in to watch Lucy I had absolutely no idea what it was about. As the titles rolled I realised that I'd seen a trailer for the movie a few weeks ago. The movie tells the story of what happens if we use more of our brain. Apparently we only use 10% of the brain at the moment. Presumably this is based on fact, but the movie explores what might happen if we use more of our brain power. Without giving too much away lets just say that the difference is quite dramatic.Scarlett Johansson plays the lead role which is also a clunky reference to the fossil Lucy. As ever Scarlett Johansson is pretty watchable with Morgan Freeman providing the descriptions of the science behind what is happening.You'll probably not remember anything about the movie in a couple of months, but it was fairly entertaining. With the exception of Lucy none of the other characters are really explored. Definitely not the best time you'll have in the cinema this year, but not the worst either!",5,2,8,3 September 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It's no phantom menace!
","Managed to avoid all reviews and discussion about The Force Awakens before seeing it which was quite an achievement. Can still remember the anticipation before seeing the Phantom Menace for the first time. The trailers to the Phantom Menace were amazing, but the film was not. The trailers for The Force Awakens were far from amazing, but thankfully the movie delivers.In addition to the familiar faces we also have a new group of characters to get to know. The empire has morphed into the First Order and the rebellion is now the resistance. Much of the film follows a deserter from the First Order Finn(John Boyega) and Rey(Daisy Ridley). We don't get to know too much about Rey's past, but sure that will be expanded on in future episodes. Unlike a lot of blockbusters there's real chemistry between the 2 leads.The movie is action packed and fun and very much in the style of A New Hope. The only real criticism I have is that it may be a little too much like A New Hope. Anyway lets forget that and just enjoy the ride. It's fun!!",7,4,18,22 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The end of the Journey
","The journey comes to an end. For me the final installment ensures that the Lord of the Rings replaces Star Wars as my favourite fantasy movie franchise. In time the film will look dated, but the story and characterisation far surpass that of Star Wars. The Empire Strikes Back is the only one of the Star Wars films that is in the same league as LOR.As with Two Towers, the Return of the King doesn't recap the story so far, so don't even think of seeing this film if you're unfamiliar with the story. It starts with a flashback to Smeagol and means Andy Serkis gets to appear on the finished print. Frodo, Sam and Smeagol then continue on their quest, whilst the remaining members of the fellowship are briefly reunited at Isengard before taking different paths to Minas Tirith.The action is unrelenting and most people will not notice the running time is over 3 hours. As with the previous films the combination of sets, models and cgi brings middle earth to life.I suspect quite a few of the performers will be in with a chance of Oscar recognition. Miranda Otto is the stand out performer and is outstanding as Eowyn and surely deserves the Best Supporting Actress honour. I'm sure that Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, and Orlando Bloom will all have their supporters for acting honours and rightly so, as they all put in fine performances. I'm not sure whether Andy Serkis is elligable, but I suspect the success of Smeagol/Gollum owes as much to him as the animators. Bernhard Hill should also be in with a shout for recognition for his performance as King Theoden. My guess is that it'll miss out on the acting awards with the exception of Miranda Otto. It's absolutely certain to take Best Director, Best Picture and a string of technical awards though. My guess is that it will be nominated for about 12 categories and take 8 gongs.Return of the King isn't flawless however. Saruman was cut entirely from the theatrical release of the film. We therefore missed out on the final face off between Gandalf and Saruman at Isengard. This was certainly filmed and will no doubt be on the extended edition. When the Hobbits return to the Shire it looks remarkably like when they left. No sign that Saruman has arrived back before them and taken over. In the book Merry, Pippin, Sam and Frodo help rally the rest of the Hobbits to retake the Shire, but at some cost to both the hobbits and the environment. Merry, Pippin and Sam become heros to the rest of the hobbits who are largely unaware of Frodo's adventure and exploits. I'm not sure if any of this was shot, but it would be a welcome addition to the extended addition. Personally I would have followed Tolkien and got rid of 7 minutes of Arwen footage and kept Saruman in. Bearing in mind Christopher Lee's passion for the trilogy it is also sad to see him removed from the final episode. I'm quite sure Peter Jackson must have had a few sleepless nights over that decision.If Saruman's exclusion was the biggest blunder of the film, Gimli's consignment to comic interlude was also a bit disappointing. I'm not against a bit of light hearted relief every so often, especially in such a long film, but it seemed that every time Gimli appeared on screen it was for light entertainment. The 'That still only counts as one' line to Legolas was very funny though.Despite these gripes Peter Jackson can certainly be very proud of the Lord of the Rings. Very few people thought it possible to do justice to the book. He has crafted a film that many people will enjoy for many years.",8,134,254,18 December 2003
Munich," A missed opportunity
","I've always had the feeling the Spielberg is the master of the popcorn blockbuster and the apprentice when it comes to anything deeper. I know that Schindler's List was an exception to this rule, but an overwhelming majority of the worlds population don't really need to examine their belief's to decide where their sympathies lie in terms of the holocaust.For those that don't know the film shows the Israili retaliation to the Munich Olympic massacre by the Black September group. The film is nicely played and the script is good, but the film is far too pc for anything interesting or memorable to come out of it.I suspect the movie is trying to convey the inner turmoil that goes on in the minds of terrorists, be they state supported or from any of the terrorist organisations around the world. I say 'suspect' because it completely fails in the objective. The film doesn't engage and an opportunity to consider what it must be like to be a member of Black September or Mossad is lost.The film's Oscar nod says more for Spielberg's reputation in Hollywood than it does for the quality of the film. The film also gives little insight into the conflict that continues to threaten world peace to this day. I saw a very interesting documentary about one of the victims relatives. They said that members of the Israeli government kept them updated on the campaign, but they didn't really want revenge. The five minute interview shed more light on the incident than this film managed to do in 150 minutes.",4,2,6,11 February 2006
The Truman Show," How long before this happens
","This is a movie that's fantastic to watch when you have no idea what it's about. You get the chance to see how long it takes for you to realise what's going on.Truman (Carey) is born into a world of 24/7 reality tv where he is the star. All his friends and loved ones are actors and he's the only person that isn't in on it. As reality tv becomes more and more outlandish you can't help wondering whether this will happen in the not too distant future.
Ed Harris is superb in the supporting role of the producer/director/creator of the show. Paradoxically he guards his privacy and is a very private person and has a number of memorable lines. Carey is also superb in the lead role and the ending must be one of the more uplifting moments of 90's cinema. 9/10.",8,0,1,3 May 2004
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Fairly good middle film
","Being a big fan of teenage girls books, I read the Hunger Games a few years back. I've always found the middle part of a trilogy of books more enjoyable than the middle part of a trilogy of films. When reading books the middle book seems to expand on the themes of the first book and sets things up for the finale. The middle part of a film trilogy always seems to struggle to have a purpose. There are obviously a few middle films which break this rule such as Star Wars ESB, but these are the exception rather than the rule.'Hunger Games: Catching fire' continues from where the first film finishes. The victors are doing the tour of the districts and we get to see a little glimpse of what these districts are like. The film doesn't explore the relationship between Katniss, Gale and Peeta in the same level of detail as the book. The best part of the film is unsurprisingly Katniss Everdeen played by Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence is in great form and obviously loving the role. There's little of note from the other actors and even Woody Harrelson doesn't seem to warm to his role.Overall the film is fairly entertaining. Not as good as the first film and hopefully not as good as the final part of the trilogy.",5,4,15,24 December 2013
The Matrix," Ground Breaking Effects
","The Matrix certainly was a ground breaking movie when it was first released. In time the effects will seem dated, but the story will continue to resonate.It's fair to say that Keanu Reeves probably isn't the greatest actor to grace a movie. But his rather one dimensional style is perfectly suited for the role of Neo. The rest of the cast are in fine form and it leads to a very enjoyable couple of hours of escapism. I'm not really a massive fan of sci-fi, but this is one of the better films of the genre. 8/10.",7,0,1,17 February 2004
Godzilla," Much better than last Godzilla!
",I couldn't really remember a lot about the 1998 Godzilla except for bit where Godzilla's eye opened. Come to think of it I've been on here that long I probably have a review of the film on here!Anyway got to say that I thought the 2014 Godzilla was pretty entertaining. The story revolves around the reawakening of 2 monsters which causes Godzilla to also wake from his slumber. The good thing about this is that there is good acting in the movie as well as the monster destruction! You do have an interest in the characters and care whether they live or die and the same applies to Godzilla! A pretty entertaining summer blockbuster!,5,1,2,26 May 2014
Deadpool," A gem
","The superhero movies certainly aren't on the top of my list of genres. Got to admit that I found Deadpool one of the most enjoyable superhero movies I've seen.The film really revolves around Ryan Reynolds as the lead character Deadpool(Wade). Reynolds is made for this role and it is very similar to the way that Robert Downey Jr plays Iron Man. The plot really plays second fiddle to the wise cracks of Deadpool and this gives the movie a feel of a comic. No doubt this will become a franchise, but something tells me it's this original that I will enjoy the most. Check it out and enjoy!",8,4,13,23 March 2016
Cloud Atlas," Complex and entertaining
","Before seeing Cloud Atlas I knew that it was a movie that tended to inspire polar views ... most people either love it or hate it. Whilst it is in no ways perfect I found the movie to be quite entertaining and kept your attention for the 3 hours running time.The movie consists of 6 story lines that are set in different time periods. The movie flips back and forward through these story lines. The idea being that what happens in one story line influences what happens in another. The cast are well known and all play multiple roles. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent and Hugo Weaving are obviously well known and all the cast seem to be very committed to the project judging from their performances. It is nice to watch a film and engage with the characters.The film is well shot and directed by the Wachowski's. It is pretty difficult to keep up with and will certainly merit another viewing. The fact that it merits another viewing must mean that it is both complex and entertaining which has to be a good thing.",6,0,4,29 March 2013
Thirteen Days," Amazing Story
","It's amazing to see just how close we were to a nuclear war. Whilst poetic license will clearly have been taken with the script, it's quite clear that the world was clearly on the brink of nuclear war during the Cuba missile crisis. Had events taken a slightly different course many of the people on this site wouldn't have been born and those that were would have lived in a very different world.Like most films based on real events this film has got to make up for the fact that most viewers will know the ultimate outcome. The good thing with this film is that most viewers will not know the detail, so quite a few of the scenes do retain an element of surprise. All the leads put in a sound performance, but it's the story itself that makes this a good film. 8/10.",7,1,1,25 April 2004
300," Substance as well as style
","I personally find this a much more rewarding film than the other recent Frank Miller film Sin City. The characters in Sin City were very cold which may have been deliberate, but it left the viewer with the same detached cold feeling. Whereas Sin City had a well known cast, the cast for 300 are less well known, but for the large part they put in some good performances. Butler and West in particular put in good performances.The story and film title focuses on the 300 Spartans as they fight against the overwhelming forces of the Persians. It seems to me like the Spartans must have had some very impressive gym equipment judging by the definition of the soldiers. With scantily clad women the eye candy factor of the film is high. I suspect the film will mostly appeal to red blooded males who love plenty of fighting garnished with battle cries and nude women. Having said that women who like muscles will also have plenty to keep them occupied. For the film connoisseur the photography is a pleasure although the script is a bit clunky in places. Better than expected!!",5,0,2,12 April 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Great fun
","Kingsman: The secret service is a thoroughly entertaining movie. It sits somewhere between the Bond movies and the Austin Powers movies in terms of action comedy genre.The film follows the prospects of Eggsy (Taron Eggerton) in his attempts to follow his fathers footsteps into the secret service. Galahad (Colin Firth) is responsible for trying to get Eggsy to join the service. The film succeeds in the area that so many other films fail - you care about the characters! This isn't only true of the lead characters either, it is also true for several of the supporting cast. There are plenty of laughs and a very memorable visual scene towards the end of the film. I guess some of the laughs may be a little vulgar for some peoples tastes, but I thoroughly enjoyed the film!",7,4,11,26 February 2015
Apollo 13," An amazing story which would be scoffed at if it was fiction!
","This is the one in which Tom Hanks didn't get the oscar. It's still a great performance though and is based on the 	  ill fated Apollo 13 mission. When you watch it you can't help thinking they were lucky to make it back to earth never mind 	  actually surviving. You also get the feeling that Gene Kranz statement that this was Nasa's finest hour is also true. Obviously 	  everyone knows how the film ends, but the journey there is pretty extraordinary. The special effects are extremely impressive as was the actors and directors patience because the weightlessness scenes are real.",6,1,5,1 December 2003
Green Book," Was this really the best film of 2018?
","It always seems a bit pointless trying to compare and rate films against each other. Quite sure there will be a heated debate going on about whether Green Book deserved to win the Best Film Oscar. According to the group of people voting for the Oscars this was the best film and they have just as much right for that opinion as anyone else. It wasn't my favourite, but hey ho.Green Book tells the unlikely friendship that is built between Tony Lip and Dr Don Shirley. Tony is a bouncer looking for temporary work. Dr Shirley is a black concert pianist about to go on a early 60's tour of the deep south and therefore in need of protection. The movie reminded me very much of Planes, Trains and Automobiles with one key difference. Somehow PTA seemed much more realistic at showing the tensions and empathy between the leads. Personally I didn't find Green Book that realistic at showing the friction and joy between Tony and Don. Being from the UK not familiar with the story and it was only quite late in the movie it suddenly dawned on me that it was a true story.Was it the best film of 2018? Yes ... according to the academy!",5,5,8,28 February 2019
The Great Escape," The perfect film for holiday afternoons
","More or less guaranteed to be shown during holiday afternoons this is based on a true story. During WW2 the germans create a prison where they house all the most notorious escapees. It's a plan that is either ingenious, if they can keep everyone in, or stupid, if everyone escapes. As we all know from the movie it turns out to be an idea of the stupid variety.It's very interesting to watch the documentaries on the escape and discussions on whether it was worth it. The german officer that killed the escapees was following orders and was eventually executed himself after the war which is also a very interesting moral question. Should he have disobeyed the orders and been shot and did he deserve to die for obeying the orders.Anyway back to the film and it seems hard to believe that anybody could have not seen this. The Steve McQueen bike ride has gone into cinema folklore. The main purpose of the escape is to cause as much trouble as possible to the germans and thereby aide the allies. A great film, but also a sad story.",8,5,8,23 December 2003
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Still one of the best comedies of all time
","Even some 30 years after it's release this still seems very fresh. Monty Python was classic comedy and this was the best Python film. There's really too many highlights to recount, but the nights that say Nee and the Bridge of Death are truly memorable. What a shame we haven't got too many comedians of the calibre of Chapman, Cleese, Palin, Idle, Gilliam and Jones around at the moment. 8/10",7,3,5,18 February 2004
Incredibles 2," Well worth the wait
","Just noticed that it is 14 years since the first Incredibles movie came out. A lot has happened in movies, since the original. The superhero movies dominate the box office even more nowadays. The second Incredibles movie is great fun though although undoubtedly more targeted at the adult audience.The movie sees the attempts of brother and sister duo Eleanor and Winston Deavor to make Super Heroes legal again. They decide that Elastigirl (Helen Parr) is the best super hero to do this which leaves Bob Parr(Mr Incredible) to look after the family. Most of the funniest parts of the movie concern the new powers of the baby Jack-Jack. The movie explores a lot of the modern day tensions of family life and is really engaging throughout. The subject matter and the length of the film may be challenging for younger children. Great movie though and hope it isn't another 14 years before we get the 3rd film.",8,1,2,31 July 2018
Sin City," Style not substance
","The general vibe about this film was very good, so I was really looking forward to seeing it. The first thing to say about the film is that it looks fantastic. I believe that several of the scenes were shot with the actors at different times with some of them not even meeting. Anyone that excuses some of the acting/direction of the Star Wars prequels due to difficulties in blue screen is clearly shown that this can work.The opening sequence with Bruce Willis is very good. The dialogue throughout has some high points and the acting is generally very good. All the components are in place for a fantastic movie, but unfortunately the film doesn't engage the audience. The film is very violent, but it's of the Tom and Jerry variety and therefore I wouldn't say the film is particularly shocking. Overall it's well worth seeing at the cinema for the look, but probably isn't one for repeated viewings.",5,3,6,5 June 2005
Spectre," It's a Bond Movie
","There's probably been even more hype with Spectre than many of the other Bond movies. Skyfall was probably one of the best Bond movies ever and whilst Spectre doesn't quite reach those heights, it's still a pretty watchable movie.You don't really need to say too much about Spectre as virtually everyone who's seen a Bond movie recognises and is familiar with the format. Christoph Waltz plays Oberhauser and is rather good as the baddie. Some of the action is a little silly along the lines of a mission impossible movie, but it's pretty entertaining.It feels a little like a setup movie for the future, but even so it's well worth a watch.",5,0,8,8 November 2015
Braveheart," Should Hollywood rewrite history ?
","This film won the Best Picture award in 1995. William Wallace is deeply in love with his childhood sweetheart who is then 	  slain by the English. Wallace vows vengeance and we're treated to a number of battles before he is eventually betrayed. This is a very 	  Hollywood version of the history - Some things are ignored, some things are changed and some things are just made up. Examples of this are the omission of the fact that Wallace fought for Edward, the change to the Battle of Stirling and William's input into the monarchy.",6,0,1,1 December 2003
Moon," A rare treat
","I had heard good things about Moon, so decided to check it our recently. I'm not a big fan of Science Fiction films and only tend to like those that are more intelligent than the norm. I was pleased to find out that Moon is definitely more intelligent than the average Sci-Fi film.The film follows Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) who is mining on the moon for the earth and is alone except for his computer Gerty, voiced by Kevin Spacey. He is serving a 3 year stint and looking forward to returning to earth and his family.I believe the film was made for a low budget and bearing this in mind looks quite good. The acting is nicely played with an interesting and involving script. The film is well worth checking out.",6,2,5,12 November 2009
True Romance," The Best Tarantino movie
","Even though directed by Tony Scott, this is the best Tarantino movie. Any great movie needs several stand out scenes and that is just what True Romance has. Clarence (Slater) is set up with a call girl Alabama (Arquette) for a birthday present. They fall for each other and Clarence looks to even things out with Drexl (Oldman) which leads to a rather violent conclusion. This sets the tone for the movie and anybody that has a squemish nature should steer clear of the movie. Some people may also find some of the language a bit industrial and it's not always politically correct in terms of race and gender.The ensemble cast put in some outstanding performances and the film is gripping from start to finish. If I was being really nit picking I'd suggest the ending was a bit weak, but it's just so good upto that point who cares. I'm sure Tarantino would have liked to have shoved this script away on his mantlepiece for a few years, because it knocks the spots off Kill Bill. With non stop action, great acting, unfussy direction and spellbinding script this is undoubtedly one of the finest modern day films to come out of Hollywood. 10/10",9,2,4,5 May 2004
Her," Not really sure whether I liked it or not
","The film is set in the future and you could say that it is a chilling view of the future! Theodore(Phoenix) is a separated man who is lonely and struggling to come to terms with being single. A new operating system is being released onto computers that includes artificial intelligence. The operating system names herself Samantha and is voiced by Scarlett Johansson.Theodore becomes more and more attached to Samantha and the film is obviously playing on many peoples (over) usage of modern day electrical devices. Theodore is in constant touch with Samantha throughout the day in the same way that many people are in constant touch with Facebook/Twitter etc throughout the day now. It is not long before Theodore is seeing Samantha as a partner and he is closer to the operating system than he is to normal people. The film is fairly interesting, but very difficult to really relate too. Phoenix is good in the lead role and the pace of the film is good. If you are really into technology go and see the movie to see if you can relate to it a little more than I did.",5,2,4,5 March 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Very enjoyable
",Danny Boyle has a bit of a hit and miss record directing films. This is very much Boyle on form.Slumdog follows the fortunes of Jamal who is a slum dweller from Mumbai. At it's heart it's a love story between Jamal and Latika told as we watch Jamal's appearance on 'Who Want's to be a millionaire'. Although it tells the story of a tough world it's a feel good movie that lifts the heart. Boyle obviously referenced some of his old movies and the films toilet scene brings back memories a similar scene from Trainspotting.It seems like this movie is going to pick up a number of awards and you can't really object to this as it's very nicely played and has a good script.,6,1,3,17 January 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," A real surprise!
",I have to say that Mad Max: Fury Road was not a film that excited me. After a run of similar action adventure movies that failed to deliver wasn't really expecting Mad Max to stand out. But thankfully Mad Max proved to be a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience.What really makes the film stand out is the fact that you have a connection with the characters. This is sadly not the case with so many of todays action adventure movies. In Mad Max you obviously have Max who lost his family in the apocalypse and wanders the world alone. It is also great that the film has a really strong lead female character Furiosa who wants to leave the citadel and head east to where she was born. To be honest Furiosa is really the lead character and Charlize Theron is brilliant in the role. The leader of the war boys is Immortan Joe who is suitably horrible. There are a host of supporting characters who are also very well explored and the great thing is that you care about what is going on during the frequent heavy duty action sequences. If you see one action blockbuster this year make it mad Max as you'll have a blast!,8,2,7,25 May 2015
Gladiator," Great fun
","This is surely one of the best blockbusters of recent years. Russell Crowe was made for the role of Maximus the great general and the son that Marcus Aurelius never had. There's evidence that the characters that Crowe plays best are not dissimilar to the man in real life. In this Maximus is full of hate and longs for revenge on the new Caesar.Crowe is well supported by the rest of the cast which includes Oliver Reed's final performance. Perhaps the other thing that this will be best remembered for is the reconstruction of Rome in all it's Glory. The final speech by Lucilla is a bit over the top, but that aside this is modern filmmaking at its best.",8,0,1,23 December 2003
The Social Network," Interesting rather than thrilling
","I had heard plenty of positive comments about the Social Network and have finally got around to seeing it. I must confess to being slightly disappointed.The story follows the founders of Facebook and their rapid rise to fame. It is an interesting portrayal of the pressures that come with owning a company that is worth a fortune. The tagline to the film is that if you have 500 million friends then you're bound to make enemies along the way. The story is really about how success leads to people wanting to share in the success and how it ultimately splits up genuine friendship. Overall I found the film well acted, well directed and reasonable, but not really gripping.",4,14,24,9 November 2010
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The best of the Indiana Jones movies
",Instead of a female partner Indy joins up with his Dad for what should be the final outing for Indy. This time Indy is battling against the Nazis again to get the Holy Grail. The chemistry and interplay between Ford and Connery is superb and really makes the film stand out from the ordinary.This is arguably the best of the three films since in addition to the action we also get to know a lot more about Jones the person. Most of the characters are very engaging.,7,0,1,15 January 2004
Back to the Future," Classic sci-fi
","This is a classic film series and the first sees Marty going back to 1955 in Doc Brown's time machine. Back in 1955 	  he searches out the 1955 version of the Doc to help get him back to 1985. During the process, he interferes with his mother 	  and fathers 1st date and threatens his own existance. The good thing about this film is that you really want the goodies to come 	  out on top against the baddies. Biff gets everything he deserves.",7,0,3,1 December 2003
The Bourne Supremacy," A classy thriller
","I have only recently got around to watching the first movie. Having seen a few good reviews of 'Bourne Supremacy' I thought I'd need to catch up on the first movie. If anyone is in the same position I'd recommend that they watch the first film before the second.The nice thing about the first film is that it stood as a single film. As you walked out of the theatre you had a complete story. The same thing can be said of Supremacy which is a rare thing in movie franchises , especially with the middle installment of a trilogy.The pace is frenetic throughout the movie and the handheld cameras make it feel very edgy. Matt Damon gives a fine performance as Jason Bourne who seems to be at the top of everybodys hitlist even though he's just trying to lead an anonymous life. It's also nice to watch some real action instead of some computer generated rubbish. I'm not a lover of franchises, but I'm really looking forward to the third Bourne installment. 8/10",7,1,4,19 August 2004
Sully," Hanks is so watchable
","There aren't that many actors around at the moment who are guaranteed to swell the box office, but Tom Hanks is certainly one of them. Regardless of the role Hanks is just so watchable.Sully tells the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger who captained the US Airways flight that landed on the Hudson. There is always an issue with a movie based on a real event (especially when it's so recent) as everyone knows what is going to happen. I wasn't certain exactly about the length of the flight, but was pretty sure beforehand that it was less than 10 minutes. The obvious question is how can this be stretched out into a feature movie. This is achieved by basing the movie on the 'crash' investigation. Whilst this is a little clunky at time it mostly works. As ever Hanks is excellent in the lead role and it's nice that the real life people had a little cameo at the end of the movie. If you like Hanks you'll enjoy the movie.",6,0,0,8 December 2016
Alien: Covenant," kind of OK
","Like many people of my generation I still consider Alien and Aliens classic movies which helped define our youth. No idea how many Alien movies have followed since, but probably seen all of them at some point. After the 2 classic original movies the others have varied between average and terrible and Alien: Covenant follows suit. The movie feels like they have stolen various bits from the other movies and re shot them into a new movie. Many of the scenes certainly echo scenes from earlier movies. The plot sees the colony ship interrupted on its journey by a storm in space and then decide to seek out a new life on an unplanned planet that looks suitable. Michael Fassbender is probably the most entertaining aspect of the movie. There isn't a Sigourney Weaver in the movie though.",5,3,12,1 June 2017
Dodgeball," Nothing new here
","Dodgeball is a fairly standard noughties comedy. For what it's worth Peter La Fleur (Vaughn) runs (in the loose sense of the word) a struggling gym. White Goodman (Stiller) is extremely successful and wants to buy La Fleur's gym to turn it into a car park for his own empire. La Fleur tries desperately to raise the cash to save his gym, but eventually bands together with the gym regulars to win the money they need via a Dodgeball competition.Most of the jokes are visual with the script offering few outstanding moments. The best bits are when the coach Patches O'Houlihan puts the team through their paces. It's a pleasant enough way to spend an hour and a half, but you'll probably not be able to remember too much about it after a couple of months. 6/10",4,0,0,12 September 2004
The Martian," Thrilling movie
","There are many movies where you never really engage with any of the characters. That certainly isn't the case with The Martian where there was clearly a lot of thought put into the script. I never really pay too much attention to scriptwriters, but Drew Goddard can certainly be praised for his work on the Martian. Looks like he's mostly been involved in writing for TV series (Buffy, Lost) in the past, so hopefully he'll be doing more feature films in the future.Anyway The Martian tells the tale of Mark Watney (Matt Damon) who is presumed dead on Mars when the rest of the crew head back for Earth. It's not giving too much away to say that isn't the case, but how's he going to survive and what's going to happen.It certainly reminded me very much of Apollo 13 in places and that's a pretty good movie to be compared with. Definitely not to be missed and one of the best movies of 2015.",7,2,7,8 November 2015
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," You'll love it or loathe it
","I can't imagine many people would sit on the fence with OBWAT. I'm going to immediately contradict that statement by saying that's where I stand on this movie. I'm a great lover of the Coan brothers movies, but this film doesn't really do it for me. The story follows 3 convicts escape from hard labour in Mississipi. The acting and soundtrack are both excellent, but the script isn't that compelling. 7/10",6,0,1,18 February 2004
Furious 7," Number 3 for me
","I saw a couple of the early Fast & Furious movies, but this is the first one I've seen in a few years. Was a little surprised about how many of the original cast are still in the movies. Having taken a look at some of the actors biographies this is even more surprising.The fact that this is the first of the Fast & Furious movies I've seen in a few years indicates that it isn't a genre that I'm passionate about. The plot and script take a resounding second fiddle to the action. The movie follows the revenge of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who's brother must have been killed by the gang in a previous movie. The action sequences are undoubtedly what the movie is all around. There is absolutely no doubt that if you loved the previous franchise movies you'll love this one as well!! Bearing in mind the box office figures it seems that there are plenty of people who love this movie.",4,3,28,16 April 2015
The Godfather," A cinema classic
",This is many peoples favourite film of all time. Vito Corleone is the Godfather and is the head of a powerful mafia family. Although heavily involved in organised crime the Corleone empire is very much underpinned by trust and honour.The real story of the Godfather is how Michael changes from being an ordinary citizen with no desire to be involved in the gangster lifestyle to eventually become the head of the family. The catalyst for this is the attempted assassination of Vito during a mafia war caused by Vito's unwillingness to become involved in drugs.The acting is quite superb and you shouldn't forget that Al Pacino was a relative unknown when this was released. Marlon Brando won the best actor award for Vito. The screenplay is superb and like all the best films you become extremely involved with several of the characters. A true classic.,9,1,3,23 December 2003
