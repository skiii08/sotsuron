The Equalizer," Finally a serious, violent and dark movie! Thanks, Denzel!!!
","Don't listen to people saying the movie is slow. Trust me, the movie is everything except slow.It wasn't action heavy, but it had some good characters, good action and amazing performances.The best parts were the moments where Robert and Teddy were face to face. I would like to see more of these scenes. The best part was the final action bit, where our hero uses everything he can, to kill the bad Russian guys. From spears to barbed wire to drills. Did I forget to mention glass and nail guns?The ending sets up a sequel, so be sure Robert ( Denzel ) will be back for more. He IS The Equalizer.The flaws are the main villains deaths, which were weak. I also missed scenes during daylight.",9,20,45,25 September 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Don't pay to watch this movie. Wait for the Extended edition!!
","This movie is a mess from beginning to the end.The first 15 minutes should belong to Desolation of Smaug, given the fact he gets killed and that's it.The movie is entirely rushed without giving closure for most of the characters. Editing was atrocious and there was no link between scenes. Beorn had 15 secs of screen time and then he just disappeared.The final battle was a joke. Most of the scene was focused on duels featuring Thorin vs Azog and Legolas vs Bolg, with some orcs being killed in the process.Trolls were retarded, by killing themselves, when they were hitting walls. Gandalf does nothing in the whole movie.The plot holes were here and much worse this time. Yes, the eagles are back! Guess what? They save the day yet again! That's funny, because they were nowhere to be seen in Desolation of Smaug. So, are you telling me that the eagles couldn't take the characters to the mountain, after saving them in the first Hobbit? That's some BS right there.The orcs now have worms. So, what happened to the worms? Why didn't they appear in Lord of The Rings? Yeah, no explanation.The movie also tries to focus on a character that nobody likes. Guess what, he steals money and he freaking survives in that flick. Don't give money to them! This movie is insanely flawed and clearly cut. The carriage scene from the trailer is NOT in the movie. You're paying to watch something incomplete. As flawed as the previous movies were, at least they worked as standalone movies. This one doesn't work.You were warned.",5,8,15,15 December 2014
