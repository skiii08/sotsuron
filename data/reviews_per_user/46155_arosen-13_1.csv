10 Cloverfield Lane," a faulty marriage of horror and sci-fi
","90% of this movie is a dungeon horror story, with all the classic elements such as psychological abuse and escape attempts. And then when the horror tale is done, the film escalates into sci fi. I wish it stayed one way or the other. I had a hard time maintaining suspension of disbelief because of the mix-up. The acting is excellent however, and while the mood of the entire film is bleak, there is plenty of tension in every scene. The story does suffer from lack of dynamism due to a single location, which made me wonder if the writers wanted to create a powder keg of pressure by keeping everyone confined to one dungeon, but it made for boring setting in my opinion, with crawling through ventilation a perfunctory clich√©. Overall, watchable.",5,2,4,15 July 2016
