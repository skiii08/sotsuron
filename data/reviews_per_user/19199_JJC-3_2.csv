Casablanca," This will not be a commentary on how great Casablanca is!
","Because anyone with even a small thinking brain will realize that Casablanca is one of the all time greats. This diatribe is directed at those CHILDREN who would try to compare todays movies (?) to Casablanca as well at the actors.To MARKS16 from London England: There was no plot to hold the viewers attention. Are you an idiot or what. There were several sub plots and the main plot which was Lazlo's needing to escape to America to evade the Nazi's and continue his resistance work. How could you miss that unless you were too busy with you game boy or your computer to notice.To MAITREG from Minnesota: Anything this silly would be laughed out of the theater and to video in a week. Maybe for you brainless moronic children who can't sit through 15 seconds of a movie unless there is an explosion or a sex scene.TO FLAVIA DIETRICH from Brazil: Bogie unattractive???? you must be blind. And nothing is convincing???? Open up your eyes and ears and watch it again!!!To SELFPARODY from the USA: It was not a story about WW2, it was a story about people in a time of crisis, and how they handled themselves during that crisis. You are a real dolt!!To AVALEN1: ??????????????????? What are you babbling about. 60 plus years later and this flop of a movie is still finding new audiences. Will your childish 2 fast 2 furious be finding new audiences in 60 years??To PLSJ from the USA: Next time you watch this movie you should turn off your IPod and your Game Boy and your computer and watch it with 100% of your attention.To JAMES P. McDONALD of California: If you do not feel any emotion when you watch this film then you must not have any. I feel sorry for you.To ALEX-506 from Toronto: Any capable actor could have communicated Rick's cynicism???? Who??? Tommy Hanks??? NO! Tommy Cruise??? NO!! Vin Diesel??? NO!!!! A-Hnold???? NO!!!! Oh wait there is ONE who could BOGART himself!To THEFAN from Detroit: And what cinematic classic do YOU fawn over?? Animal House??? Star Wars???? 2 fast 2 furious???? You are an idiot for sure!To PAUL ARTHUR from London: Casablanca not serious, you need to go back to watching Benny Hill then!!!!To BETTY BULLOCK from AUTRALIA????? Fight Club??? American Beauty???? Mulholland Drive???? WRETCH!!!!!! 3 garbage pail movies. ANY movie that requires a nude scene to rope you in is no great at all!!!!! Anyone can strip naked to get the guys and the lezzos into the theater.To SPUD-48 from Idaho: The reason for the 'No Questions' was to protect Ilsa from the Nazi's since if they knew she had a relationship with Lazlo they would try to use her to get to him!! Do you now understand??? Rick does not hide the letters while the spotlight is on him, he waits until it is moved and then slips them under the lid of the piano. The Nazi's can not arrest Lazlo in Morocco because they have no authority to do so. Only Capt. Renault can make that arrest, and he is content in knowing that Lazlo and Isla will never get out of Casablanca, and only does a reversal of sorts when Rick tricks them all into thinking HE will be going to Lisbon with Ilsa and leave Lazlo to rot in Casablanca. Renault basically switches sides when he lets Ilsa and Lazlo board the plane. That choice is cemented when he tells his deputies to 'round up the usual suspects' after Rick shoots Strasser!This is as far as I will go in this diatribe. I am sure the remaining 50 pages of commentary have more childish remarks like the ones I have taken to task above. They are all idiots too!",10,2,6,23 June 2005
North by Northwest," North By North West or How couldn't Hitch & Grant win a Oscar!
","Alfred Hitchcock is arguably if not the greatest director of all time, certainly one of the top two or three! And Cary Grant by AFI's own poll is the second greatest actor of all time. So how could neither of them or both of them win an Oscar for this movie! NBNW is a two plus hour thrill ride from the moment of Thornhill's abduction to the cut away as the train enters the tunnel at the end! NBNW keeps you attention without all of the dumbing down of the post Star Wars era that permeates the cinema today. (See the original Rollerball vs the remake for proof of this remark!) Hitch is the master at so many cinematic techniques that the so called greats use today, and Grant is still copied for his suave and distinguished on screen presence.NBNW is the highlight of Hitch's career to that point and the ultimate Grant role! And to point out the errors in this film is just sour grapes cause every film of today has its errors, most also lack the quality of a Hitchcock/Grant film!",10,1,3,29 January 2008
