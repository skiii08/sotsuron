The Blair Witch Project," Just Not Scary
","The bottom line: I just wasn't scared. I just wasn't. I thought it was a great idea and I thought it was interesting to watch. The actors were good and seemed to ring true. It was a fantastic achievement for $30,000. But it didn't scare me. Not in the least. My fiancÃ©e was bored during parts of it and I can see why. I, too, was a little bothered by the fact that they filmed everything even though they thought their lives were in danger. And as far as the jerky quality of the filming, I have to agree with radio personalities Don and Mike: If I want to see ugly teenagers and bad camera work, I'll watch MTV.",Null,0,1,15 August 1999
Goodfellas," Best movie ever made.
","As Howard Stern says, 'There's not a thing wrong with this film.' One scene melts into the next, obscuring its length. It blows by, and before you know it, it's over. The acting, directing and cinematography are all superior. In measure of the acting quality, DeNiro doesn't even give the most memorable performance. The film is wonderfully constructed. I love the middle-is-beginning motif. The movie has some of the funniest, most powerful, most memorable scenes in film history. In short, this film blows you away.",10,0,0,9 November 1998
