The Double Life of Véronique," A very sophisticated commentary
","A very beautiful, if somewhat confusing, film. A lot of the people commenting here have already said it, but I will repeat it anyway: Irene Jacob does a fantastic job in this film in terms of acting, and she's angelically beautiful too. Although there is very little dialogue, she conveys a huge amount to the audience - another example of Kieslowski's genius for visual narrative. Her performance, combined with the fantastic cinematography, shot composition and selection, and music, make this film a treasure to behold. Virtually every single frame of this film would look amazing if you blew it up and hung it on your wall in a picture frame, and I bet that if you sat blindfold in your living room while the film played, you would have a pretty amazing experience as well. The storyline of the film was admittedly fractured and vague a lot of the time, but sitting here a couple of hours after watching it, things are starting to click in my head. The Polish part was fine in terms of narrative, very engaging. Then we cross over to France, and we are shown a lot of tiny snippets of Veronique's life, which we immediately try to start piecing together to form a story. None of these snippets ever join together to form something concrete... this is Veronique's lostness and confusion as she searches for something to fill the void left by Veronika. At least that's what I think. There are still parts I don't understand, such as what exactly happened outside the cafe where she meets the puppeteer, and what happens at the end of the film when Veronique touches the bark of a tree and we see her father inside the house. Strange. Maybe I will understand more when I see the film again, which I certainly will - but probably best to wait at least 6 months. The only gripe I have with the film is that it seemed a bit drawn out and boring about 3/4 of the way through, when very little was happening... but I have to forgive Kieslowski this because a film this great doesn't come along very often.",10,3,8,4 September 2001
The Blair Witch Project," Me, slagging off The Blair Witch Project
","What a piece of tripe! A gimmick is a gimmick, but these pitiful con-men with their self-made Jiggle-Cam (TM) will get no sympathy from me. If you can bear the vomit-inducing vibrations, atrocious recurring dialogue, and despicable characters, the final 2 seconds of the film are actually quite good in a chilling kind of way. Is it worth it? NO WAY!!! I would watch ANY film in preference to this one, and that includes The Waterboy.",3,0,1,8 June 2000
The Beach," Argh! So much left out of the original story!
","Bit of a disappointment here I'm afraid. The book was riveting, but the film attempts to get away with Blu-Tack. ...(?)... As usual Leonardo Di Craprio is nauseatingly.....nauseating (why do people ever give him parts which require him to look happy?? He just looks so utterly stupid!). The plot is not very gripping, hardly any of the characters are fleshed out at all (because there are so many of them? the book certainly managed to include a lot more detail), and certain parts of the story are played upon too much at the expense of others (e.g. Daffy, who is dead, at the expense of Richard's relationships with Francoise, Sal, Keaty, etc). Watching it, I felt rather more analytical than usual, which probably demonstrates my lack of immersion in the film. The main problem for someone who has read the book is that so much is left out. Then I think of the people who haven't read it, and realise all that they are missing out on, because in just 2 hours they have seen something which may ruin their enjoyment of an excellent and thrilling novel. Final comments: Leo should die; that French chick was HOT!; what is it with kickass soundtracks in films these days?",6,0,0,19 February 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," OK for your eyes and ears, but leave your brain at home
","Bad points: -the plot was on the whole predictable and unspectacular -the cutting between scenes sometimes seemed abrupt and rough-edgedGood points: -lots of shiny happy (and interesting) young people to gaze at (esp. Larisa Oleynik!) -more than a few good laughs -sufficiently loud (and varied) soundtrackOverall, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see it if you're not a teenager - if you are though you'll probably find it quite good fun even, if your not into romantic-type films",8,0,0,2 December 1999
No Man's Land," A war film for Europeans...
","Finally, a war film that isn't all about Americans. No Man's Land takes a cynical look at the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1993; the war between the Serbs and the Croats.Cynical... absurdist... tongue-in-cheek... the film avoids making a statement about the war and who is fighting who; instead we get two sworn enemy soldiers who don't even have the guts to kill one another, UN peacekeeping troops who can't find a common language amongst themselves let alone communicate with the Bosnians, and a gang of press reporters who outnumber the soldiers and know more about what is going on than anyone else involved.Yes, it is a war film, but there are no airstrikes, no missiles, no platoons of infantry charging at each other in combat. A few shots are fired, and a handful of people die, but that's it. There are no heroes here, just total confusion and chaos.Deceptive in nature but utterly charming and compelling underneath, the film thrives on Danis Tanovic's humour which promotes silliness but never comes close to overstepping the boundaries of credibility.The film is riveting from first minute to last, which is testament to Tanovic's Cannes-prize-winning screenplay, and although the inevitable conclusion is left unspoken, the 90 minutes that preceded it seemed so wholesome and refreshing that I have to award it full marks: 10 out of 10.",10,1,3,25 September 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Brilliant but flawed
","Moulin Rouge is an amazing film, you cannot deny it that. I cannot praise it highly enough. The musical numbers are a work of genius, and show excellence in every single aspect of film-making, and some aspects you didn't even know existed. It shows touches of brilliance in places where other films don't even have places. The acting is superb and because the acting is superb the casting is superb. The singing is wonderful too. The duets between Nicole and Ewan are delightful, and the no-holds-barred in-your-face song and dance routines are breathtaking. Musically, there is genius stamped all over this film - where else are you going to find Lady Marmalade blended perfectly with Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit; Madonna's Like A Virgin re-worked into a mini-operetta; or a love serenade that glides seamlessly from The Beatles to Whitney Houston without seeming out of place? And at the heart of it all, a tragic love story so simple and pure that it could have flowed from the pen of Shakespeare or been scrawled by the stylus of Homer.And yet, this high-concept simplicity of the story proves to be the downfall of the film. With no other concepts on the menu other than Ewan's undying love for Nicole, and her predicament, the film is doomed from the onset - it has nowhere to go but towards its final destination, and nothing to do but repeat itself until it gets there. There are several key lines and song lyrics in the film which will stick in your head at the end; but were you astute enough to notice that the only reason they stuck is because you heard them six times each? It's as though the writers had a photocopying problem and ended up with a rogue page of dialogue repeatedly popping up elsewhere in the script. Either that or Baz Luhrmann is unaccustomed to the phrase 'flogging a dead horse'. That major plot simplicity gripe aside, the only other thing that irked me was the cinematography - a lot of the time images looked as though they had very little depth of field and poor reproduction of dark colours, almost as if they had been shot on a poor-quality DV camera. Maybe this was intentional and maybe not, but either way it did the film no favours. Having said which, all the colours and digitally-enhanced bits were vibrant, and you can forget any stunning landscape or sunset shots you may have seen in your life, because the close-ups of Nicole's face have redefined the meaning of beautiful cinematography - at least in my humble opinion :)Anyway, as you can probably tell by my words, Moulin Rouge is a two-faced demon of a film - at its best, inspired, uplifting, and beautiful; and at its worst, repetitive, clichÃ©d, and overly simplistic.I'm sure it will be remembered forever for its daring originality in bringing a forgotten genre back to life, but whether it deserves a place in our memories as one of the all-time great films... is highly debatable to say the least.",8,0,0,20 September 2001
Mulholland Drive," and now for something completely different...
","I just went to see Mulholland Drive. I came out of the cinema, and I had no idea whatsoever what just happened in there! I'm not going to bother trying to analyse what happened in the film or reach some kind of logical explanation, because I'd almost certainly get stuck somewhere and make myself sound like a ponce.One thing is for sure though - the film was utterly compelling from start to finish. I remember realising about halfway through how great it was, and then thinking that there were so many loose story strands hanging around and doors that had been opened, that it would never be able to all tie up in a nice neat conclusion. Mulholland Drive is a vast plate of spaghetti, and the fork David Lynch gives us is the optical illusion with four prongs at the top and three at the bottom.There were a lot of amazing elements about the film - the acting was superb (I love that fake, sitcommish American smiliness that Lynch writes into so many of his scenes), the cinematography flawless as always, the images on screen intriguing, scary, beautiful and supernatural. As ever the music contributes hugely to creating atmosphere and scaring our pants off without anything even happening on screen.If you can tolerate the lack of logic, coherence and reason in the plot, then this film will make you think a million and one thoughts and should soon establish itself as one of your favourites.",Null,1,2,4 January 2002
