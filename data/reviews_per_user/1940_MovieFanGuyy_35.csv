Frost_Nixon," Frost/Nixon is the one of the best films of 2008 so far in my opinion!
","I saw Frost/Nixon and I can say that Ron Howard, (who was seriously slipping since his completely awful DaVinci Code) has completely redeemed himself.This has the best performance of the year by the great Frank Langella as Tricky Dick. Michael Sheen, best known to western audiences for playing Prime Minster Tony Blair in The Queen does another magnificent job as playing the playboy talk show host turned political journalist David Frost.All in all a great political thriller, and a great bookend to one of the most controversial periods of political history! Should be on a great number of top ten lists this year, as well as Oscar nominations.This movie proves that with the worst president in history, (George W. Bush) that power corrupts especially those with no souls! Thank goodness this film came out right before Bush left office!",10,0,2,1 April 2010
Mission: Impossible III," I just got a screening of M:I 3 last night! (spoilers ahead!)
","Actually, I was pleasantly surprised, a much bigger and better improvement over the awful Mission Impossible 2, but, about the same league as the first film. This has a much better story, better action sequences, and this time, the IMF team is actually a team. Ethan Hunt, who has recently retired from active field agent IMF service is working as a 'construction worker' and is now recently engaged to Julia, his fianc√©e and doctor. Hunt is pulled back into agent duty when one of the agents he trained, (A very kick butt Keri Russell) is captured by international arms dealer, Owen Davian, easily the best spy bad guy of any film in the last decade. The plot involves Hunt being sucked back into active service to retrieve a deadly agent called 'The Rabbit's Foot' for Davian, and man, this film makes the action sequences in Mission 2 look like child's play. I really enjoyed the film this time around, sure, some of the parts of the story are lame at times, but the action delivers the goods. Once the IMF team hits the Vatican, it picks up steam.The first half hour is kind of slow, but once the second hour rolls around, it's action galore. Hunt's IMF teammate Luther is back, along with two new agents on his team, the beautiful Chinese agent, Zhen, (played by the beautiful Maggie Q) and Declan played by Match Point's Jonathan Rhys Myers, who is relegated to driver duty. Some of the action sequences, including a jump from a Shanghai skyscraper, and an ending bridge sequence are completely unbelievable. Only the director of Alias, JJ Abrams could have pulled off action sequences this amazing without looking completely silly.This is definitely a massive improvement over the second Mission film, and I would rank it beside The Bourne Identity as two of the best spy thrillers in recent years. As the saying goes, check your brain at the door and have a great time with this film! It's a perfect blending of True Lies, Bourne Identity, and the first Mission: Impossible film.The Mission franchise is thankfully back on track!",10,4,9,2 May 2006
Se7en," Se7en is definitely one of the most disturbing and shocking films of the 1990s!
","David Fincher's frightening 1990's detective thriller, Se7en, is easily one of the most underrated and overlooked films in the genre.Like the 1991 best picture winner, The Silence of the Lambs, Se7en, concerns another mad killer, this time with the moniker, John Doe.It's up to the two lead detectives, Somersett, and Mills to find him.SPOILERS: In an east coast city (the name is never revealed, but, it's very likely NYC) A mass murderer is leaving dead bodies with revealing clues as to their behavior for the police.Police homicide veteran, William Somersett who is days from retirement has been asked to find the killer along with new rookie, David Mills, played by Brad Pitt.Through a series of clues, and very dark subplots we find that the police have actually become the pawns in a very dangerous game.I will not reveal the shocking ending, but to say it's one of the best twists in this genre is an understatement. John Doe can take his place alongside Hannibal Lecter for pure unrelentling evil.One of my favorite thrillers of the 1990s.A 9 on a scale of 1-10.",9,0,0,14 September 2009
Star Trek," The long, beloved Star Trek franchise is back with a huge bang!
","I was one of the lucky few people to catch an advanced screening of this franchise reboot of the original Star Trek series. As a long time fan who grew up with Gene Roddenbery's work, I have to say that in recent years, science fiction has gone downhill. In recent years, the aging Trek series has completely worn out even it's most defiant fans. After Roddenbery left the Star Trek stage, under the direction of Rick Berman, Trek went into a nowhere direction, with three average Next Generation films, (First Contact was good, but nowhere near as exciting as the best of the original series of films) Deep Sleep Nine was a constant bore, Voyager was little more than Lost In Space of the 1990s set in a Starfleet universe, and Enterprise went nowhere fast.Star Trek was going completely in a tailspin until Lost creator J.J. Abrams, came aboard to jolt the aging Trek franchise with a much needed rush of adrenaline! Wow, this is easily the best Trek film in 20 years, bringing back the excitement of James T. Kirk, Spock, McCoy and all the original crew back to their full glory. It's like seeing old friends all over again (even though this is an alternate universe.) Yes, this is a reboot, but the film has much needed action, and a new storyline that will bring new fans of the decades old science fiction franchise. Well done guys, for the first time in many years, I'm ready to go on another Trek! This is easily one of the best films so far this year! I love The Next Generation show and characters which I grew up with, but, I'm sorry, their films cannot, I repeat cannot touch the magic of the original crew at all!Best of all, you don't need to be a fan of the series to watch this film. It's designed for people who have never seen a single prior Trek film or television show to enjoy it. Take the family, it's great entertainment!The academy recently expanded it's best picture category to ten films. Star Trek should be on that list!",9,19,55,14 April 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Am I the only guy who hated Inglourious Basterds? Doubtful. This is Quentin Tarantino's WORST film!
","I am a HUGE fan of Quentin Tarantino. I think that Reservoir Dogs is a great early 90's heist film. Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films of the 1990s, Jackie Brown is a homage to early 70's blacksploitation films and very entertaining, Kill Bill, while a little on the long side, was really fun, and I absolutely loved Grindhouse, (both films) But, I am one of the few people who really found all the over the top historical revisions in Tarrentino's Inglorious Bastards to be a little too much nonsense for me, and therefore I have to admit I hated Tarantino's new film.While I think Quentin Tarantino's over-the-top violent antics works in some genres, I just can't take an over the top violent World War II comedy like Inglorious Bastards the least bit seriously, and that's why I really didn't enjoy it. I really hate it when directors like Tarentino conveniently re-write history just to entertain themselves.Another problem with the film is that it goes on for far too long. This is the first time I nearly fell asleep reading endless subtitles with people speaking in French and German. And, there is absolutely no way that a German commander would let a hillbilly speaking in crappy Italian into a theater full of SS people. And their is no way that Hitler would allow himself to be gunned down so easily by two of the bastards.I love World War II films, such as Saving Private Ryan, and I think that Tarantino is one of our most unique directors, but the two don't match up at all. Perhaps, he can bless the world with a Pulp Fiction sequel someday. Perhaps.....",1,16,32,20 September 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Truly magical, and one of the very best films of 2005!
","Disney's highly anticipated Chronicles of Narnia, has several decades worth of fans who are waiting eagerly for this adaptation.My friends, the hype is definitely worth it, the story, the acting, the visual effects, all marvelous.Narnia, as many people know concerns four small children who take up shelter in a professor's house.While playing hide and seek, one of the children, Lucy, stumbles upon an old wardrobe in the professor's house. That wardrobe leads to the magical world of Narnia.From there the four children take on an adventure of epic proportions, with talking animals, and all sorts of fantasy creatures.This is what each of the four Harry Potter movies have each wanted to be so far, and failed to do! Truly magical and one of the very best films of 2005, highly recommended! If you see this film, see it on the very best screen, because the sound and visual effects are truly spectacular! Narnia will surely become a box office smash for Disney, opening the door for more of the books to be filmed!Three and a half stars out of four! Here comes Oscar nominations!Winner of the 2005 Academy Award for Best Make Up.",10,14,23,1 December 2005
Public Enemies," Public Enemies is my favorite film of summer 2009 so far!
","Michael Mann's Public Enemies can be best described as The Untouchables meets his 1995 hit Heat. Johnny Depp, back in serious mode, plays notorious 1930's bank robber, John Dillinger who leads his gang of bank robbers, known as the 'public enemies' robbing banks all over the country. He steals money from the banks and gives it to the little guy. On the other side of the law is Melvin Pervis, FBI agent, played very well by Christian Bale in a nice return to dramatic form after starring in one of the biggest action films of all time.And in the best role of the film, recent Oscar winner, Marion Cotillard, plays Dillinger's loyal girlfriend, Billie Frechette. The film spans several years, involves the capture and escape by Dillinger in a maximum security prison, only to have the FBI led by Hoover, assign Pervis to bring in 'public enemy #1' John Dillinger.As a fan of gangster movies, this one is near the best filled with terrific acting, great dialog, and top notch directing by Michael Mann. Depp, Bale, and Cotilliard all stand out in their roles, and, even minor characters such as Pretty Boy Floyd are allowed to stand out. Heck, even famous gangsters like Frank Nitti show up in Chicago. All in all, a tragic ending to one of this country's most famous bank robbers, and easily the best film by Michael Mann since his 1995 Heat. Despite the mild reception from some critics, this is my pick of the best film of the summer so far. I'll be laughed at by some for saying this, but I really feel that with the academy now picking 10 nominations for best picture, Public Enemies should be one of them!Three and a half stars out of four! A must see!",10,5,10,14 July 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Bourne Ultimatum, the best film of summer 2007! Spoilers!
","The Bourne series comes to a close with the release of The Bourne Ultamatum, Matt Damon, Julia Styles, and Joan Allen reprise their roles from the earlier films, and adding to the top level cast are David Straighthurn, Albert Finney and Edgar Ramirez.Jason Bourne, still on the run from the CIA agency who trained him comes into contact with a London journalist who has written a piece on him that might give him insights into his past, which is the most important piece of the puzzle to the paranoid former assassin.After a thrilling first act, which involves Bourne protecting the journalist from his CIA assassins, Bourne also comes into contact with a former agent, Nicky Parsons, who wants to help Bourne recover his memory.One butt kicking action sequence after another we as the audience get to participate in one of the most frenzied and chaotic environments in cinema history.Matt Damon was born, (no pun intended) to play Jason Bourne and this, as well as his Will Hunting role from the 1990s will be what this great actor will always be known for.The answers are finally laid out, and the cards are all on the table as Bourne flees for his life from potential assassins and government agents, while piece by piece solving this mystery of his identity and who trained him into the person he now is.Not only is this the best Bourne film yet, this is also definitely the best action film of the summer, that is both a thrill ride and an exceptionally intelligent piece of film-making.Here's hoping for another Jason Bourne adventure in the next several years!Winner of three Academy Awards, including Best Sound Effects Editing.",10,0,1,4 August 2007
The Aviator," Sorry, but, Marty strikes out again!
","Okay, I was lucky enough to see The Aviator in Hollywood, along with half of the world celebrities. With all of the hype of this movie, you would think that Christmas is coming early.This three hour film starts off well enough but seriously loses steam after it's first hour with Hughe's funding of his big project, Hell's Angels, by the end of the film, with the Spuce Goose, barely anyone in the audience was noticing. Blame it on the slow moving script by John Logan which just skims over Hughes life.Sorry to disappoint you, but, Marty Scorsese strikes out again, with a lackluster script and terrible performances by Leo and Gwen Stafani.This movie putters along like a tortoise, with an occasional brief appearance from some of Hollywood's greatest early actresses.However, one of the main problems, is that Leo DiCaprio just is not believable at all as Howard Hughes in the least. He looks, acts, talks, and dresses like Leo DiCaprio. Every time he spoke I thought he was the drifter from Titanic trying unsuccessfully to imitate Howard Hughes, as well as Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.There are great performances from Jude Law as Errol Flynn, and Cate Blanchett as Kathrin Heppern.However, my advice to No Doubt lead singer Gwen Stafani is to keep your day job, because you seriously need acting lessons. You make look like Jean Harlow, but you sure don't act like her in the least. Also, Kate Beckinsale looks strikingly close to Ava Gardner, but, she basically sleepwalks through her role.Also, I don't think that Marty Scorsese was up to the task of directing the biography of Howard Hughes, I think that Michael Mann should have kept the project, as he is more suited to successfully direct compelling biographies.I think that Michael Mann and Marty Scorsese should have traded projects this year, with Mann directing The Aviator and Scorsese directing Collateral. I think the results would have been much better.All in all, not a total disaster, but far from the best film of the year.Two stars out of four, not worthy of a best picture award in the least.Far from Scorsese's best work.",1,38,73,9 December 2004
Watchmen," I'm not a fan of comic book movies, and Watchmen is another reason why.
","Watchmen, which was released earlier this year by Warner Brothers was both a critical and financial disappointment. I understand completely why now. The storyline, which takes place in an 'alternate universe' demonstrates how a group of costumed vigilantes must struggle with themselves to see whether or not humanity is worth saving from nuclear war. The characters are flawed in this film. Nite Owl, suffers from impotence, Silk Spectre, comes from a troubled childhood. Dr. Manhattan, a glowing blue nightmare who walks around fully nude, contemplates the value of human life. Rorshach, is a psychopath who walks the streets braking people's bones and dispensing his own form of justice. Oxymandias, feels that humanity must be saved by destroying it, and The Comedian is a full blown idiot, who serves his own agenda.Many audiences who in years past have enjoyed many critically acclaimed box office comic book hits were severely disappointed with this film and I can understand why. First of all, much of the music is highly questionable, and some of the scenes such as Nite Owl and Silk Spectre getting it on inside of his owl shaped spaceship elicits unintentional laughter from the audience. Second is the unnecessary graphic violence. There is absolutely no reason to show a prisoner getting his arm's sawed off in a jailbreak whatsoever, other than to shock the audience for cheap laughs.Plus, the storyline goes off in a thousand different directions, with one storyline choosing a philosophical point of view, the next choosing a violent point of view, and the third storyline choosing a humorous point of view. I'm sorry but with a film going in so many different directions it's hard to maintain interest in the storyline, or many of the seriously deranged characters here. All in all this feels like the dysfunctional family syndrome of comic book movies. I was highly disappointed, and I feel this is one of the weakest comic book movies ever adapted for the big screen.One and a half stars out of four. One of the worst comic book movie ever made.",1,5,11,14 July 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," 'Honey is it over yet?' A common phrase among theater goers with this film.
","That is what my wife asked me half way through yet another long, boring, and pointless Harry Potter film (Warner Brothers must be desperate for cash these days, this got stale and old years ago) Anyways, here we are with yet another Harry Potter film. This time the seventh. What is the point this time? I have no idea, the plot for every film is the same, the villain, Voldemort wants to kill Harry Potter, and yet, this simple plot line has been extended who knows how long.What was at one time slightly amusing has become rather stale, tired and just plain boring.This time around the three leads, Harry Potter, and his friends Ron and Hermoine are on the run looking for something called horcruxes which are supposed to kill off the evil Voldemort. (which is something that should have been done years ago) In any case, what probably works well on the page doesn't work so well on film. This episode called Deathly Hollows continues the same tired and stale storyline of the last several films with absolutely no pay off yet again.I know that many will state I am being too hard on Harry Potter but I have never found these films to be as enjoyable as it's fan base. I think I checked my watch over a 100 times waiting for this film to end.",1,9,16,8 December 2010
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," T2 is without a doubt the crowning achievement in James Cameron's career!
","Terminator 2, the sequel to the film that put James Cameron on the map, takes Cameron's legendary science fiction alternate reality film series to levels never before seen.Arnold Schwarzzenegger, the future governor of California, steps back into his iconic role with relative ease, and proves that no one can play the Terminator but him. No one.Linda Hamilton also returns from the first Terminator film as the mother of John Connor, the leader of the resistance and savior of mankind.And Edward Furlong, nowadays doing who knows what makes a great first impression in his film debut as the young John Connor.Nothing Cameron has ever done, or likely will ever do, will top this cinematic achievement which pushed action, special effects, and pacing to unprecedented levels.This is by far the best film in both Schwarzenegger and Cameron's careers, even though G.I. Jane Linda Hamilton is a bit silly at times since it's hard for her to compete against the towering Terminator and his nemesis, the liquid metal, T-1000 played with effective cunning by Robert Patrick.Bravo, Cameron, you hit a home run, unfortunately nothing he had done since had made nearly the impact, not True Lies nor the highly overrated Titanic, can compete with Terminator 2 as the peak of this talented director's career.",9,2,2,5 May 2008
Independence Day," ID4 is easily one of the most overrated and cheesy films of all time!
","Independence Day, otherwise known by the abbreviation, ID4, was the blockbuster film of the summer of 1996, powered by Will Smith, and of course, a nonstop promotional blitz by 20th Century Fox.Directed by Roland Emmerich, director of 1994's equally cheesy Stargate, and the completely awful 1998 Godzilla, insults the intelligence of every moviegoer with this travesty. The man simply cannot direct, period.Advertisement was through the roof during the summer of '96 promising non stop special effects and an unbelievable science fiction story.Unfortunately, special effects were the only thing that was available in this film, since the story is completely cheesy, stupid, and just plain unremarkable.The three leads, (Will Smith, the cocky and smart mouthed fighter pilot, Jeff Goldblum, the cable employee who cannot drive a car and relies on his father for transportation yet, comes up with the virus that save humanity and Bill Pullman, the clueless president of the United States who doesn't even know about Area 51) are simple caricatures of cheesy 70's disaster movies from which they are based. None of them are remotely believable in any way whatsoever. Everyone thinks that Will Smith was terrific in this film, however, I feel he was a lot better, in the superior 1997 science fiction film Men In Black.Another point how could Steven Hiller, (Will Smith) find his stripper girlfriend in the middle of a supposedly destroyed Los Angeles after 'borrowing' or actually stealing a helicopter from the most idiotic guard in the history of mankind?! Or better yet, the United States itself would not be able to survive after it dropped a nuclear weapon on it's own backyard as they did in Houston in the film, just another laughable oversight by the filmmakers!The 'story' if there is one, involves a nonstop invasion from outer space, and the destruction of our planet.It's just another humans vs. them science fiction film that has been done hundreds of times in the past, with far better results.Want a better film with a similar premise, try watching 2005's War of the Worlds, directed by the great Steven Spielberg with a far better storyline involved. None of the characters are remotely interesting in ID4, and one of the characters played by Miss Doubtfire's Harvey Fierstein was so annoying, that it was the only time, I smiled to see the end of that irritating character.But, the real thing that makes ID4/Independence Day such a terrible film is the completely ridiculous notion that one measly cable repair man with a laptop computer can disable the aliens shields to allow the United States and other countries to take down their spaceships. (And people thought the ending of War of the Worlds was unrealistic!)This is definitely one of the most unbelievable endings to any film ever made, and completely insults the intelligence of every moviegoer who had to endure this film.ID4 rates one star out of ten. Rent 2005's War of the Worlds instead!",1,8,15,22 September 2006
No Country for Old Men," I absolutely hated No Country For Old Men, and I am serious about it.
","The Coen Brothers, one of America's most talented directors, with a string of terrific films behind them have changed Cormac McCarthy's controversial novel into the front runner at this year's Oscar ceremonies.Unforuantely, as in year's past, this film, is going to purely divide moviegoers. Critics and Academy members are going to reward the Coen brothers for their adaptation of McCarthy's novel. Moviegoers, on the other hand, seem to have a divided opinion of this film.I saw this film with a completely divided audience. The storyline, concerns a drug deal gone badly in the Texas outback. A retired welder and Vietnam veteran, played by Josh Brolin comes across a case full of thousands of dollars in the pick up truck of a Mexican drug dealer. Unforuantely he doesn't realize the case has a homing device, which hired killer, Anton Chigurh, played to complete chilling effect, by Javier Bardem who easily steals the movie from the rest of the cast, uses to track him down.Chigurh, has deadly ways of killing off those who stand in his way, including a contraption used to kill off livestock, which he uses to blow open door locks and people's heads off with ease. Chigurh, pursues Llewelyn Moss, played by Brolin and his wife, who he sent off to Odessa, in hopes of outrunning the cunning Chigurh, with only local sheriff, Bell, (Tommy Lee Jones) who has a chance of protecting them.I won't give much more details except to say that this film felt like half a movie, the two main characters' and their stories felt completely unfinished, and that was the key problem with McCarthy's novel. I am a huge fan of the Coen Brothers and their films, Fargo, one of the best films of the 1990s, The Big Lebowski, one of the funniest films I have ever seen, and a film that I watch on a regular basis, heck, I even enjoyed The Hucksucker Proxy, but, like last year, with the overrated, Martin Scorsese film The Departed, I think that critics and academy members are looking to reward the Coen Brother's work, rather than their film. I'm not going to say it's overrated, just that the ending felt completely unfinished. The film doesn't state what happens to either Chigurh, or Moss. The audience and many people who I have spoken with felt the film was completely unfinished, and felt like half a movie. I agree with them. Unfortunately, I think the academy will reward the Coen brothers for this film, rather than they did with their far superior Fargo in 1996 which covered similar territory as No Country For Old Men.",1,74,129,14 February 2008
Twilight," This is one of the worst movies, I prefer Underworld to Twilight!,
","Yes, I have to admit, that chick flicks are not my thing (Never have been, never will be either, heck I even hated Titanic!) My wife really wanted to see this movie since she is a fan of the book it is based on, and since this weekend's movie night was her choice, I decided to tag along.However, I cannot tell you how ridiculous this movie was, I simply could not relate to either of the leads, and I have seen far better vampire films than this one.I easily preferred both of the Underworld films, which covered similar territory to this film.Yes, I realize that a lot of teenage girls will be upset about that comment, but I stand by it. Twilight is easily one of the most dull and boring vampire films I have ever seen! Give me Underworld any day over this. Sorry ladies! Please end the agony of this nonsense soon.",1,7,9,20 July 2010
Revolutionary Road," My Personal Problems With Revolutionary Road (Spoilers)
","It seemed to me that April and Frank Wheeler got married just to 'achieve' the American dream. Then April becomes unhappy with the marriage, and becomes a rather annoying wife, a nagger. Somehow, I just wanted the film to end, I got sick and tired of their bickering, their arguments, and I have seen this setting on AMC's Mad Men dozens of times. Michael Shannon as the neighbor does give an Oscar worthy performance, but I felt it wasn't nearly as good as Mende's earlier film, American Beauty, released nearly a decade ago!Leonardo DiCaprio does excellent work here, but Kate Winslet, completely overreacts, and I really didn't sympathasize with her selfish decisions in the film. I just wanted these two people to divorce and move on. I really thought this was like two hours of pure torture to watch.",1,29,104,9 December 2008
Schindler's List," Schindler's List is Steven Spielberg's masterpiece and the best film of the 1990s!
","Schindler's List, the Oscar winner for Best Picture of 1993 is definitely one of the great films ever made, it cemented Steven Spielberg's status as the greatest filmmaker of our generation, and it cemented the evil legacy that is the holocaust.Oskar Schindler, played masterfully by Liam Neeson is the center point of this masterpiece, all surrounded by some of the best professionals in the business, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, etc.For years, I avoided writing a review to this film, because it is too painful and too powerful to write something about a film that has haunts you for many years.The holocaust was one of the most evil experiences in human history. For a director like Steven Spielberg to take such a horrible human tragedy and to make something poignant about it, demonstrates his abilities as the greatest director of our time.Spielberg takes the story of a greedy, selfish German businessman, and uses it as a force to demonstrate that human tragedy can turn anyone into a force for good, no matter what the consequences.Nominated for 12 Academy Awards, and winner of 7 including Best Picture, and Spielberg's first Best Director Oscar, Schinder's List can take it's place aside some of the greatest film achievements of all time.",10,15,23,27 January 2008
The Hurt Locker," Just give Kathryn Bigelow the Best Director Oscar!
","The Hurt Locker, which was released last summer, is one of the best Iraq war films ever made, tense, exciting, and a true point of view of one of the most unpopular wars in recent memory.Jeremy Renner plays Army specialist William James, an EOD bomb disposer who has diffused nearly 900 bombs in the Iraq war, he's a thrill seeker, performs well under pressure, and keeps his teammates alive.Bigelow, wisely avoids politics of the war, and like other great war dramas like Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan, uses the soldier's point of view in combat.William James and his team diffuses several bombs in the film, including removing a detonating devise buried in a boy's body, the last bomb, which is chain strapped to an Iraqi civilian, is especially tense, and it's thrilling to watch James work his magic under extreme pressure.It just goes to show the heroism and courage our fighting men and women go through everyday to keep us safe. We can hate the politicians and the people for dragging our troops into harm's way, but, movies like The Hurt Locket make me especially proud of our people in uniform.Congratulations, Mrs. Bigelow. You should prepare your Oscar acceptance speech any day now!The Hurt Locker winner of six academy awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Congratulations to all involved in this fabulous film!",10,32,50,5 January 2010
Million Dollar Baby," Million Dollar Baby, the best film of 2004!
","Clint Eastwood won his second best directing Oscar and his second Best Picture Oscar with Million Dollar Baby which was not only his best film since Unforgiven, but it's a lot better than Mystic River.Million Dollar Baby is not about boxing, but about the characterization of three characters and the struggles that they face in the boxing ring.With films like Million Dollar Baby, Unforgiven, Flags of Our Fathers, and of course, the best picture nominated Letters from Iwo Jima, Clint Eastwood continues to prove that not only is he one of the most iconic American actors in history, but that he had the tenacity and courage to leave his western image behind to become one of America's best directors of all time. His craft will be remembered for generations.Winner of four 2004 Academy awards, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actor.",10,4,8,2 August 2007
Mulholland Drive," Mulholland Drive is easily David Lynch's masterpiece.
","David Lynch has always been one of my favorite directors. From Eraserhead, to Twin Peaks to Lost Highway, he has never disappointed. To say his films are weird are an understatement as his films definitely have an acquired taste.Mulholland Drive, which was released back in 2001, was originally another television pilot which was going to be used by ABC, after the resounding success of Twin Peaks in the early 1990s. However, the network found the episode a little too strange for their taste, so they decided to pass it up. Lynch, being the visionary that he is, found international funding and was able to make his truly weird vision for one of the most unique films of the last several years.Betty Elms has just arrived in Los Angeles from Ontario Canada with dreams of stardom in her mind. She stays at her aunt's apartment and has an audition immediately scheduled. Another mysterious woman, named nicknamed Rita, is found after a car accident with no memory of who she is, but all we know about her is that she has a lot of the mob's money in her purse.In all Lynch glory, the tables are turned on both characters and nothing is what is really seems. Characters and situations are not what they seem, and this is a film that needs to be seen several times to figure out the clues as the the real meaning of the ending of the film.All I can say is that I hope that Lynch can continue making great movies as he has not had a big mainstream hit since 1999's The Straight Story, his first and only G rated film.Mulholland Drive, definitely a film for true Lynch fans, and definitely not to be missed.",10,2,3,1 July 2010
Black Hawk Down," Nearly a decade after it's release Black Hawk Down is still haunting!
","Ridley Scott's triumphant Black Hawk Down is easily one of the best war films ever made, combining the graphic battle footage made famous by Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan and combining them with the relentless editing made famous in Scott movies like Gladiator.It's 1993, Bill Clinton is the new president and the country of Somalia has plunged into civil war with tens of thousands of people dying from war and starvation the situation escalates to the point where the United Nations and the United States bring in American servicemen fresh from their victory in the 1991 Gulf War to assist in distributing food and other supplies. But the residents of Mogadishu have other plans. Led by a vicious Somali warlord named Mohamed Farrah Aidid whom the United States plans to capture.What was going to be an easy extraction became easily the most violent military episode since the Vietnam war with nearly 20 American servicemen graphicly killed and hundreds of Somalis killed in the process.What was originally a small civil conflict is pushed right in front of your eyes in Scott's remarkable film where hundreds of Americans literally fight for their lives to escape the city of Mogadishu.Top notch action, acting, and direction from the great Ridley Scott and a personal triumph for producer Jerry Bruckheimer famous for those Pirates of the Carabeean films. Definitely one of the best war films ever made!",9,3,5,23 June 2010
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Yet another tiring, and repetitive adventure with Harry Potter, this series feels like it's running out of steam!
","This review contains some spoilers.Warner Brothers highly anticipated Order of the Phoenix, had it's U.S. premiere in Los Angeles several days ago, and like many other industry insiders, I was given a peak of this film at Warner Brothers studios.Now granted, I am not a fan of the books, since I have never read one. Could care less about what Hogwarts stands for, and don't see what the big fuss over an extremely deformed creature named Voldemort is all about and how 'scary' the guy is supposed to be. I came into this film as an audience member and that's it.When we begin the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter is being picked on by his cousin Dudley and his friends and is summarily attacked by a dementor. Harry is attacked by the dementors, and Harry fights them off again. (Didn't we already see this in the third film?) And, Harry is sent off to a wizard's court, where he is to be expelled from the wizarding school for destroying the Dementor in front of his cousin, when Harry's mentor, the shabbily dressed Dumbledore pleads with the Minstry of Magic to let Harry go back to school.Then Harry is taken to the house of his godfather, Sirius Black, played by the fabulous Gary Oldman, where Harry meets the Order of the Phoenix, an group of wizards formed by Dumbledore, determined to fight off Harry's adversary Voldemort and his group of KKK dressed bad wizards called Death Eaters.For two and a half hours, we get the same repetitive storyline as we did in the four previous Harry Potter films, except in this film, we get very little excitement until the end of the film, where Harry Potter and a large group of students he organized, called Dumbledore's Army fights off Voldemort and his group of wizards. The ending really didn't challenge me at all, and more frustrated myself and other members of the audience who were not as familiar with the events of the books as other people in the public are.We get new characters including one of the most irritating private school teachers all dressed in pink. I just wanted to roll my eyes. The acting from most is serviceable but the film's talky plot line could bore some viewers over the two and a half hour course of the film.Judging the film as a movie not as a book, The Order of the Phoenix felt like a rushed, and talkative film with very little excitement, except for the death of one of the prominent characters at the end of the only real action sequence in the film. Many will be disappointed at the lack of action and exciting sequences in this film, as it is definitely the slowest film of these movies yet. The reaction was mixed at best, those familiar with the books seemed to follow the events better than those who have not read the books. In my opinion, films should stand on their own, even if you have not read the books, and so far, none of the Harry Potter films have been able to convert those who are not as familiar with the events of the books. In the past I have not been kind with my reviews of the Harry Potter movies because they have not been able to truly explain to the film going public why they should invest their emotions into characters that seem so lifeless. I should have cried at the death of one of the characters, but by the end, I didn't care, I didn't have any emotional attachment to any of the characters like a good movie should have. By the end of the film, Harry Potter and his friends in the wizarding world are right back to where they were at the beginning of the film which is that Harry Potter has finally convinced everyone that his enemy Lord Voldemort is back.It didn't need to take a boring, and talky two and a half hour movie to get that simple point across. This film feels simply like the Harry Potter films are seriously running out of steam before the last book hits stores. Once again, the Warner Brothers studio delivers a disappointing Harry Potter film. Yet again, we are treated to the same wizard and their wands duel that occurred in Goblet of Fire. I was ready to yawn at the end of the film along with the rest of the audience.In the end Harry tells his friends while boarding a train, 'We have something worth fighting for' Haven't we already gone down this path, just kill off Voldemort and get on with it. As the saying goes, get on with the story already. I don't know how many people have much interest left for anymore Harry Potter movies, I know I don't.",1,23,58,9 July 2007
Avatar," Cameron is back with a record budget, but his storytelling and dialog haven't improved.
","Yes, I was able to see an advanced screening of James Cameron's long awaited science fiction film, Avatar.So, what's good about it? The visuals are among the best ever seen, the planet Pandora truly comes alive, and the creatures, wildlife, etc. All look fabulous on the big screen.What's bad about it? Cameron's trademark lame dialog is back, as well as his less than ordinary scriptwriting. The characters, with the exception of Signorey Weaver's scientist character, and Stephen Lang's Colonel Quarritch all feel wooden. The hero doesn't feel alive, he feels generic, and I felt the bad guys 'humans' were cardboard caricatures. Not to mention the story is far from original. It's basically Dances With Wolves/ Pocahontas meets Aliens.What's the story about? (SPOILERS AHEAD!) In the future, Marine soldier, Jake Sully, (Played by Austrailian Sam Worthtington) is a paralyzed veteran, whose twin scientist brother was killed. The Resources Development Association, a greedy energy corporation, similar to the one used in Cameron's Aliens film gives him an opportunity to take his brother's place in the Avatar program designed by the RDA to infiltrate the natives of Pandora called the Navi, who stand ten feet tall, have blueish skin and act like Native Americans, plus they speak English. (What a surprise!) The RDA have brought in a group of marines led by the evil Colonel Miles Quarrich, easily the most interesting character of the entire film, to make sure that the Navi are displaced from their home so that the RDA can extract a mineral called 'Unobtainium', which is worth $20,000,000 an ounce, since the Earth is in an energy crisis. The film has some of the greatest visuals ever recorded on film, but after a while your eyes can get a little exhausted from seeing every little detail in 3D. After Jake's introduction to the Navi by 'driving' his Avatar body, the film slows down as Jake and his new found love, Neitri, played by Zoe Saldana, fall in love, and Jake discovers how the Navi tribe works. But, time is running short, Quaritch and the RDA want to displace the Navi, by force if necessary, to mine the unobtainium from the Navi grounds.The ending involves marine equipment of every sort, gunships, robotic suits, etc, all while the Navi face them down with flying dragons, dinosaurs, bows, arrows, etc. It's one of the grandest visual effects scenes ever put on film.All in all, how did I feel about this film? Well, it's certainly an improvement over Cameron's previous entry Titanic, but his clunky dialog, and shoddy storytelling are still present, and most of the characters really aren't fleshed out very well. Worthington's Sully doesn't really feel alive, Saldana's Neitri is basically Sully's Navi love interest with little to do. Giovani Ribisi's greedy corporate shrill, Parker Selfride, is a whiny irritant, and Michelle Rodriquez, plays a sympathetic marine pilot who does little in the film. Only Weaver's Dr. Grace Augustine and Stephen Lang's Quarritch stand out among the crowd. Where Cameron succeeds is in the technical aspects of the film, the visuals, by Peter Jackson's effects company WETA digital, are first rate. Also, most of the action feels unoriginal since we have seen a lot of this material in Cameron's far superior Aliens film. Plus, it never even comes close to reaching the heights of his best film, 1991's Terminator 2 Judgement Day. Plus as I said earlier the dialoge is borderline retarded, hearing lines out of Quaritch's mouth is so bad, I was hoping for some cotton balls for my ears every time I heard one of his annoying speeches. Not to mention the logical thing for the RDA to have done was to negotiate with the Navi for the unobtainium instead of taking it by force, but then again, Cameron doesn't want to use logic, he sees corporations as the ultimate evil. Very little gray in this film. The RDA is evil and the Navi are good, end of story.Would I see this again? Maybe, maybe not, but the slower aspects of the film and some of the dialog are very irritating to listen to. My wife actually got a migraine headache from wearing those 3D glasses for over two and a half hours.To sum it all up, the visuals shine, the story lags, and the dialog is awful.Avatar is not bad, but not great either. I would say it's average.",1,151,511,12 December 2009
The Da Vinci Code," I liked the book, but I hated the film version of The DaVinci Code.
","I enjoyed the book of The DaVinci Code and, to my surprise, everything that was interesting in the book was seriously missing in this film, there was no suspense, any real sense of adventure, and no real surprises at the end.Tom Hanks is completely miscast as Langdon, and I pictured a more interesting character than his interpretation. Hanks does nothing really interesting in this film other than reacting to others and their emotions.Audrey Tautou is also not much better as Sophie, and I also pictured another actress in this role.The only 'actor' in this film who completely redeems himself is the great Sir Ian McKellan as Teabing, even though, I pictured someone like Sir Anthony Hopkins in the role instead.This is not like a Ron Howard film, and it shows, Howard, who is a very talented director, with such hits as Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind, is completely wasted, as he puts in the storyline of the book, with none of the advent's tone of the book.Like the Harry Potter movies, the book is a whole lot better than the finished product.Not as controversial as many people think, but nowhere near as interesting either not at all.",1,0,2,20 July 2010
Titanic," James Cameron's 1997 Titanic is easily the most overrated film in history!
","Titanic, which is currently the biggest film of all time, (Why? is the biggest question of them all!) definitely has divided moviegoers in the last decade since it's release. Many women feel it is one of their favorite films of all time with great special effects, and a lead that they can relate to. Most men on the other hand, obviously feel very differently than women do about this film.Many others, like myself, easily feel that James Cameron's Titanic is easily the most overrated film in history with bloated, cheesy and banal dialoge, two dull lead characters, and a storyline which cheapens the tragedy of the sunken ship.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet play the star crossed lovers aboard the doomed ship, while a supporting cast with Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, and Bernard Hill do their best in trying to keep the screenplay and Cameron's bloated dialoge from falling out of place.The visual effects, which looked decent at the time has not held up well, there is a lot of pixelation of the ship itself, and the crash sequence today looks like something out of a playstation video game.The dialoge also today does not hold up well, and many sequences such as Rose holding up a middle finger does not support believability in the least. Secondly, while the two leads are treading frozen water, both of them would have died from hypothemia long before the ship itself sank to the bottom.Third, Rose's character would have died even quicker floating on top of the piece of wood since the ocean wind is actually much colder than the water itself, not to mention the water on her body would have also caused hypothemia as well. Why her character was one of the few survivors is a puzzlement to credability of this film itself.This film will continue to divide moviegoers for many years, with many of it's fans liking it, and those who despise and hate Titanic, will also continue to do so.James Cameron had a great opportunity to explore the legacy of the famed sunken ship, but instead by focusing on a teenage romance, with banal dialoge, and two wooden leads, it definitely kills not only the storyline, but the credability of this film as well.In my opinion, Titanic does not hold up well to stand the test of time, and that is why it's easily the most overrated film in history in my opinion. His last great film was 1991's T2, as both True Lies and Titanic contained much of Cameron's famously banal dialoge and bloated budgets.",1,17,144,4 June 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Goblet of Fire was a huge disappointment, just another dull and pointless Harry Potter movie.
","I admit, I have never picked up a Harry Potter book in my life, and I am judging this film, solely as a movie, not as a book.' With that being said, this film is an editorial mess, jumping from one frame to another with little exposition.Granted, I saw a cut of it at Warner Brothers studios back in 2005, before it was released to the public, but, I am fairly sure that the cut I saw was the final release cut of the film.The flow of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is atrocious. It simply jumps from one bad CGI scene to the next.The characters are bland at best, and I really don't care about what happens to them.Some of the sequences are unintentionally funny, such as Voldemort's cohorts, which look like members of the KKK at a Klan rally.The film is a giant mess, and unless you're a huge fan of the books, you really won't enjoy this film at all. I could care less what happens to him or any of his companions in the future.Ralph Fiennes is badly miscast here, in one of his usual ham it up villain roles.His Amon Goeth, from Schindler's List would eat Voldemort for breakfast! Not to mention, Michael Gambom, an excellent English character actor does a horrid job of playing Dumbledore, the headmaster of Harry Potter's school who dresses in extremely shabby clothing.He looked more like a weird hippie wizard wanna be, in my opinion.Overall, Goblet of Fire is more of the same old Harry Potter, bland and uninspiring! Two stars out of four at best.",1,1,2,20 July 2010
The Departed," The Departed is easily 2006's most overrated film so far!
","All of the undue 'praise' coming upon Marty Scorsese's film of The Departed is completely irrelevant.The film is simply a remake of the superior Infernal Affairs, a Chinese action film from 2002, that had better narrative, better characterization, better dialog, and far better tension.It seems that every Scorsese fanboy and Leo fanatic across this nation has made The Departed a major hit, however the goods just don't deliver.Once again Marty is back to his old gangster film-making, and this time it's the old and tired cops versus gangsters tired and clich√©d formula.It worked for GoodFellas, not so much for Casino, and it badly misfires here.Titanic teen heartthrob, Leo DiCaprio, trying unsuccessfully again to look like a mature actor, plays an undercover cop sent by the Massachusetts Police to infiltrate the Irish Mafia headed by Jack 'over the top' Nicholson.Jack once again plays Jack, this time with a darker side.Matt Damon plays the mafioso sent to infiltrate the Massachusetts Police Department.The whole film is about both Leo and Damon trying to find each other's identity before it's too late.None of the characters are remotely interesting, and I could really care less about who got killed or not, the film plays like another one of Scorsese's tired gangsta flicks.Slightly better than Scorsese's two previous efforts, but, nowhere near as good as his last great film, GoodFellas, The Departed ranks a 3 on a scale of 1-10!Looking for a better film, try the Hong Kong action flick, Infernal Affairs, which The Departed is based on, it's a MUCH better flick than Scorsese's latest film.",1,2,8,31 October 2006
War of the Worlds," Spielberg out does Independence Day with this superior film!
","2005's War of the Worlds, Steven Spielberg's second collaboration with Tom Cruise and the remake of the classic novel was a smash box office hit.Outdoing Roland Emmerich's trashy 1996 alien invasion film, Independence Day, by every step stars Tom Cruise in a surprisingly effective role as a selfish and divorced dock worker with two kids in tow for a weekend that none of them will ever forget.What starts off as a routine weekend with the kids becomes all all out force for survival as alien invaders, looking to destroy all of mankind pushes, Ray Ferrier, (Tom Cruise) to the brink of insanity.Now I am one of the first people to admit that I personally cannot stand Mr. Cruise and some of his recently irritating antics, from his couch jumping, to his undying love for then girlfriend, (a much younger Katie Holmes, who is young enough to be his own daughter) and, his much publicized debate with Matt Lauer on the effects of psychiatric medication.However, if you can put Mr Cruise's obviously inflated ego aside, you'll see one of the most effective performances as a man whose character arc becomes of the film's most uplifting qualities.The visual effects were flawless and were rightfully so nominated for Best visual effects at the 2005 Academy awards ceremony.Steven Spielberg has turned his usual friendly alien comes to Earth tale upside down and shown second rate directors like Roland Emmerich how an alien invasion film is really done! Nominated for three academy awards, including best visual effects, War of the Worlds is a fantastic trip down the terrifying side of alien contact!",9,3,6,20 June 2007
Inception," Christopher Nolan proves that he's definitely one of the top directors of our day.
","After months of disappointing remakes, sequels, and big budget CGI fests that were badly written. (Avatar comes to mind.) I am happy to say that one director, Christopher Nolan, proves that story always triumphs over eye candy, with his latest flick, Inception.Two years after breaking box office records, with his previous flick, Christopher Nolan returns with a vengeance, with his latest film, Inception, which isn't a sequel at all, but an entirely original idea.Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief who specializes in a 'special kind of security' that of the mind. He and his team of specialists are given a task by a CEO named Saito, played by Ken Wattanabe, of not extracting information from a young CEO, Robert Fischer, played by Cillian Murphy. Normally I find DiCaprio to be annoying in many of his films, but here, he doesn't overact, and I think it's good to finally see DiCaprio in a film that isn't directed by Martin Scorsese for a change.Cobb's team goes deeper and deeper into Fischer's subconscious when Saito is shot, which means if he dies, that person may never wake up. The layers include, a hotel battle without any gravity, a slowly falling van off of a bridge, a battle in an arctic layer, and a beach filled with crumbling buildings. In each layer, Cobb must battle with his own personal demons, including his wife, Mal, played by Marion Cotillard. Who may or may not be what she seems.I understand that this film will be quite confusing to many viewers, including the ending, which may seem quite on the upbeat side, until you realize it also may not be what it really seems.All I can tell you about this film is that it will be discussed for many years, with people debating on what is real and what is not real, sort of what happened with the Matrix craze during the 1990s.Inception, the latest masterpiece from director, Christopher Nolan.James Cameron, THIS is how you make a movie!",10,3,7,19 July 2010
Despicable Me," Consider me tickled I enjoyed Despicable Me more than Toy Story 3.
","I know that many people are going to knock me around for this review, and I understand that, but I really throughly enjoyed the new animated film Despicable Me.I see many films every year, including How To Train Your Dragon from my own studio, Dreamworks, which was an excellent film. Shrek 4, not so much. Then comes Toy Story 3, the latest adventure with Buzz and Woody. While it was great to see them back on the big screen, I wasn't as impressed with the third film as many critics and fans of the series were, and I feel that the inevitable fourth Toy Story film should go back to basics and focus on the central characters like Buzz and Woody again.Which leads me to Despicable Me. Now, like most other people, the trailers really didn't interest me at all. It was only after my young daughter had heard from her classmates how great the film was to watch and how much that children had really enjoyed it.So, I took my family to see this film, and man, I really enjoyed it! Steve Carrell's Gru is the first animated anti-hero that I really enjoyed watching. Where Toy Story 3 was filled with many mean spirited characters that actually frightened many small children (I heard many children screaming at times.) Despicable Me was definitely more light hearted. Was Despicable Me a better written movie than Toy Story 3? No. But was it more enjoyable? Yes, I would have to say so. I enjoyed the light hearted spirit of the film, rather than the dark tone of the latest Pixar film and the minons easily steal the film.I can see Despicable Me become a series of animated hits for Universal and with great word of mouth spreading, I think that the filmmakers have made one winner of a great animated film. Despicable Me was far better than the last Shrek film, and more enjoyable than the latest Toy Story film for me and my family. I understand many will disagree with my review, and that's fine with me.",9,5,9,19 July 2010
Toy Story 3," I liked Toy Story 3 but....... not as much as the first two films.
","Pixar is back at it again, with a film that fans have been waiting for over 11 years, Toy Story 3. All of the great toys are back, Buzz Lightyear, Woody, and so fourth. (There are serious spoilers in this review so beware!)The first and ending parts are the best, but I felt that the middle story was really weak, and this series is really starting to show it's age.The first film, which was released back in the mid 1990s, was the first CGI animated film in history was was another great milestone in Disney animation, and Toy Story 2 was released four years later, and is considered by many, including myself, to be the best film of the series.Now 11 years later, Disney and Pixar are back with Toy Story 3. This time, Andy, the owner of the toys is now 17 years old and about to depart for college. He hasn't played with his toys for a long time, and they are starting to miss their interactions with him. After a very imaginative opening, which takes the opening of the first film to a new level, the very long mid-section begins, which takes the characters from Andy's house to a daycare center called Sunnyside, to a landfill, and this section is very long and prodding. Aside from a few humorous moments such as Buzz speaking in Spanish, the story lags in this section. Woody finds a young girl named Bonnie who is a child who attends Sunnyside, and goes to her home. I also seriously missed BoBeep's interactions with Woody from the first two films.Some of the middle sections are extremely cheesy to watch, such as Ken and Barbie, and a bad fashion show set to the tune of 70's disco hit 'Le Freak', which has got to be the low point of the series. After the high note of Toy Story 2, which doesn't have a weak moment in it at all, I found quite a few low notes in Toy Story 3. Sure, many will disagree with my points here, but as a fan of this series, I felt that the middle section needed a lot of work.The end brings it all home as Andy is reunited with Buzz and Woody and the last time he plays with them and says goodbye to his beloved toys is easily the best part of the film. With that being said, when Pixar makes a fourth Toy Story, I say that they start from scratch and focus on the central characters as the third film had far too many characters interacting in a very weak mid section which was nothing more than an animated prison escape film. I loved the first two Toy Story films, as well as other Pixar classics like Up, Monsters Inc, and The Incredibles, but I didn't enjoy Toy Story 3 as much as the first two Toy Story films. It's great seeing Buzz Lightyear and Woody back on the big screen, but next time, hopefully Pixar will focus on the central characters rather than adding too many characters next time around in the inevitable fourth Toy Story movie. I would give this three stars or a 7 rating. However these characters are timeless so we'll see them on the big screen again guaranteed.",7,3,12,23 June 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Deathly Hallows part 2 is another headache inducing nightmare, thank god the Harry Potter film series is OVER!
","I have never really been a fan of Harry Potter, and I truly do view this series as a passing fad, nothing more. I have never read the books, and I am only reviewing this as a film, nothing more.Well, folks, we have finally come to the end, the last Harry Potter film, THANK GOD.How does this film end? Not well. Instead of a coherent story, we get flashbacks and other excuses for a lack of a decent script this time around.The plot, or lack there of, finds Mr. Potter and his two friends looking for pieces of the villain Voldemort's soul while at the same time, their boarding school is attacked by minions of his enemy.What should be an exciting scene, or battle, instead becomes a frustrating experience, with scenes cutting back and fourth, back and fourth. We get a scene with Harry, then cut back to the 'battle' over the school, then back to Harry, we see people seriously injured or dead, but we don't know how. That is another reason why these films are so frustrating to watch, because a person should not have to read a book to know what is going on.Another case in point, Voldemort clearly kills Harry Potter at one point, but then he 'miraculously' comes back to life, and in their final wand fight, Harry clearly kills his adversary, but the film clearly doesn't not explain why very well.I found the ending completely anti-climatic, confusing, and dull as well. Even worse, many of the performances are completely wooden, including Harry's red headed girlfriend. At the end of the film, which takes place 20 years later, she looks about as uninteresting as a person can be.I'm sure that many Potter fanatics will disagree with my review of this film and the others in the series, but oh well, I'm entitled to my opinion and I am sticking with it and I always will.The Potter films have always been a frustrating and dull experience for me and this film is no different. Give me the Chronicles of Narnia any day over these headaches any day. The best thing I can say about Deathly Hallows parts 1 and 2 is that Harry Potter is FINALLY OVER. Thank goodness! Please Academy, ignore this tripe and give the awards to far better films this year!Overall this film is FFO, For Fans Only, nothing else!",1,12,35,20 July 2011
Munich," Munich is easily Spielberg's best film since 1993's Schindler's List! One of the best films of 2005!
","This is easily one of Spielberg's best films since 1993's Schindler's List! Munich, the great Steven Spielberg's new political thriller retracing the horrific events of the massacres of the Israeli athletes in 1972, is not only the best film from Steven Spielberg since 1993, it is also the film that is sure to turn off many of his loyal supporters around the world.Munich has no easy answers. From it's beginning to it's end, the film's graphic subject matter will not be easy for those to take.Eric Bana, Oscar worthy in every way, portrays Israeli Mossad (intelligence) officer, Avner Kauufman who was years ago a bodyguard of the then Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.Kauufman is a loyal Israeli supporter who wants nothing more than for a strong Isreal and it's citizens.Hours after the massacre at Munich, Avner is contacted by an Israeli intelligence officer played by Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush to plan a top secret mission of retaliation against the members of Black September, a Palestinian terrorist organization responsible for the murders of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games.Avner is brought together with a group of European Jews each with a certain specialty, one who is great with weapons, and for getaways, one for creating explosives, one who is excellent with forging documents, and one for clean up, leaving no traces of Israeli responsibility.The first sets of retaliations goes as planned as the group led by Avner and his hit-man team track down and 'assassinate' each of the Black September members responsible for the assassinations in Munich.Shortly afterwords, the tables are turned against Avner and his team as Black September and it's members begin tracking Avner's team in retaliation for the first bombings. Avner starts feeling the pressure when members of his own team are marked for assassination, and after some of the bombings go horribly wrong. This starts to mark questions in Avner and the audience's mind about what is right and what is wrong in dealing with terrorism.This begins a long game of cat and mouse between the Israels and the members of Black September as they chase each other across the globe, from Europe to the Middle East, searching for revenge on one another.One of the biggest and most tense scenes is where Avner, and a member of Black September argue each other's point, Avner justifying the existence of Israel, and the Black September member arguing for a homeland for the Palestinians.There are no points in confronting terrorism, is the movie's message, each time you retaliate, the other side will also retaliate.This is definitely Spielberg's darkest film, with some of the most graphic violence recreating the assassinations of the Israeli athletes, and those looking for simple answers will not find them in this film.Spielberg has raised some serious questions, about the state of Israel, it's existence, and how they handle and justify their defense against terrorism, and this film could anger some of his most loyal fans.However, I applaud Spielberg for the questions, that he and his film have laid out, and the questions it asks for how our country is leading the current War on Terrorism.One word about this film, it is surely going to be controversial, some will absolutely hail it, and some will absolutely hate it. This film will surely divide people, into some really hard decisions, that's for sure! Four stars out of four!Nominated for five 2005 academy awards including Best Picture and Best Director, and easily one of Spielberg's overlooked masterpieces of dark drama.",9,5,8,16 February 2007
Heat," Michael Mann's Heat is one of the best action films of the 1990s!
","Michael Mann's Heat, his masterpiece action film from 1995, is definitely one of my favorite films of all time, from the great storyline, to the characters, to one has got to be one of the greatest action set pieces in modern film-making, Heat has it all! Al Pacino plays Los Angeles Homicide Detective Vincent Hanna, the man on the hunt for his prey. He has no social life, no time for his family, and no time for B.S. The man's sole purpose is to go after his prey, nothing more.On the opposite end, Robert Deniro plays master thief and heist operator, Neil McCaley, a man with a sole mission in life, to take down scores, he lets, no one, nothing stand in his way. He is calculated, precise, and above all, he makes little mistakes.In between the two lead characters is an all star cast, all at the top of their game, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Wes Studi, 24's Dennis Heybert, Prison Break's William Fincter, and Natalie Portman all give their best to Michael Mann's unforgettable screenplay.The entire film is about the relationship between Hanna and McCaley, one takes down scores, and the other is determined to use whatever means to take him out.The action, fantastic, and the bank heist, near the end has to go down as easily the best action sequences ever filmed in the 1990s.The directing, Michael Mann proves he can direct with the best of them with this fantastic film.Heat, unfortunately was not nominated for any Oscars, but, in recent years, has gained a huge and appreciative following from those who enjoy their crime films, without the presence of annoying actors (Leonardo DiCaprio) or over directing from Martin Scorsese.1995's Heat remains an underrated classic of unprecedented proportions and that's saying a lot!",9,0,1,20 July 2010
Up in the Air," Watch your back Avatar, Up In The Air could likely win best picture because it truly deserves it!
","Juno director Jason Reitman has done it again. Up In The Air is by far the most enjoyable film of 2009. Bristling with outstanding performances led by George Clooney, this film is rightfully the Oscar front runner, and if the academy is wise, reward this film with the Best Picture Oscar! Up In The Air, is not only highly enjoyable but it's also by far one of the most relevant Oscar front runners in years. The country is in an economic meltdown not seen since the great depression (all thanks to the incompetent leadership of George W. Bush, but that's another story!) Ryan Bingham, played by George Clooney is a guy who works for a company that 'lets go' of employees all over the country. He makes it easier for companies to lay off workers who are too timid to do it themselves. He's so good at his job that he has nearly racked up ten million frequent flier miles. In fact, that's where he feels most at home, 'Up In The Air'. Bingham's company hires a new employee, Natalie Keener played by Twilight's Anna Kendrick, who has developed a new program of laying off workers from behind a computer screen, making it easier and more cost effective to lay off workers without the high cost of flying and hotel rooms. Bingham takes Keener under his wing to show her how to do the job correctly, and in the process meets another lay off specialist Alex Goran, played by The Departed's Vera Farmiga, with whom he shares a close relationship. Bingham's philosophy is to have as little attachments as possible, nothing personal, to keep things completely casual. It's a philosophy he shares at regular speaking engagements. It's the same philosophy that he shares with many of the people he lays off. However during the course of the film, he realizes that personal relationships are the key to surviving a lay off, and that human companion ships are worth having.Clooney has never been better, Anna Kendick, does a terrific job of playing a hungry Cornell graduate who finally realizes the human toll of letting people go from their jobs, and Farmiga is Clooney's equal in the film.Jason Reitman is one of America's most promising new directors from his debut in Thank You For Smoking to the great Juno to this.Up In The Air, truly deserves the Best Picture Oscar at the Academy awards, and there isn't enough praise for it's cast or storyline. Truly the best film of 2009, and far better than the hugely overrated Avatar.",10,1,9,5 January 2010
