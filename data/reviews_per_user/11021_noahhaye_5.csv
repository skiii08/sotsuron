Mission: Impossible III," The first one I could call...Okay.
","With the first one...eh and the second one forgettable, I really wasn't excited for this one. If the X-Men, Jurassic Park, or Taken taught me anything, it was that the 3rd movie will suck. Or will mark the end of awesome movies in the franchise.With this, I was delightfully surprised.This was JJ Abrams first movie as a director, but you could never tell. The writing was a lot better, the characters were better, and holy crap, Philip Seymour Hoffman was just GREAT. Not really much I can say though, because I REALLY wanna see Mission Impossible 4. From what I hear, this film was AWESOME and I just can't wait!",8,1,1,6 October 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," It's not bad. It's worse
","The amount of sheer awfulness and mediocrity in this film simply cannot be described in words.We already got dumped on with Brett Ratner's incredibly god-awful X-Men: The Last Stand which shocked us on how low it went and how amazing the first and second X-Men can't hold a candle to it. Now we have this, the story that neuters Wolverine. Honestly, this is one of my favorite movie franchises, but this is just a disaster on epic proportions.Why? Well, for one, it has more inaccuracies than The Dark Knight, and I'm not saying that TDK was a bad film at all, but you have to admit, you did ask yourself how the Tumbler got onto that 8th floor in the garage at the beginning. This one has someone looking down the viewfinder of a tank, but really it's the inside of the tank barrel.Second, it answers questions no one could care less about or gives us inadequate answers. For one, we're not buying that James got his claws through trauma. If so, I would've gotten claws from seeing all the 9/11 photos. Another question they answered was where he got his name. See, I always thought that he got his name from the actual animal, but nope. It's from some dumb story about the moon and Trickster told by his girlfriend, Silverfox, who was just another 'bottom of the barrel' character.Third, the special effects are just disastrous. This movie doesn't have to be made by the same people who made Tron Legacy or Star Wars, but come on. Why change Patrick Stewart's face to have an incredibly ugly CG-i botox makeover? Fourth, Dead pool. Just search up Dead pool in your search engine. Now add 'x-men origins' to the end of that. See what I mean? All in all, this movie is unworthy of the franchise and kicked it while it was down, until the 2011 miracle that was First Class.",1,1,3,17 December 2014
X-Men," So this is the one...
","This is the one that influenced so many superhero films like Spider-Man 1 and 2, Iron Man 1 and 3, and Captain America. Thank you very much, Bryan Singer.No really. This movie is quite entertaining. The special effects are a little old and cheesy for this day and age, but this is still a landmark film nonetheless. It not only started a whole genre of superhero films, but also started Hugh Jackman's mainstream cinema career before Les Mis totally fancified him. Plus. the thought of Captain Picard working with all the X-Men was entertaining.The dialogue faltered in some places, like the infamous scene where Storm asks Toad 'You know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning? The same thing that happens to everything else.' Otherwise this movie was a hugely immense success since it succeeded while the superhero industry was butchered by Superman IV, Captain America (the 1990 one. Cool your britches.), and The Fantastic Four. Yeah, there was actually a worse F4 film than the 2005 and 2007 ones.",7,0,0,17 December 2014
Mission: Impossible II," Let-down from an already let-down
","Where the first film was...eh...but not forgettable, this one was the exact opposite. It was bad and mainly forgettable.This is especially sad because I've seen the director (John Woo) do some really good, fun, over-the-top movies like Face/Off. This one...well it was over-the-top.There are no memorable action scenes, no memorable characters, Ving Rhames was annoying as hell in this, and the romance was really forced. Ethan (Cruise) tries to hook up with this girl (Newton) after he busted her on her mission and nearly got into a fatal car crash with her. Gee, I can feel the love in this movie.The only things that were sort of cool were the Oakleys Cruise was wearing, the bad guy, and the knife-to-eye shot in the climax. Otherwise, this film was really forgettable.",5,0,1,5 October 2015
Mission: Impossible," eh...
","When I first heard of this movie, I was excited because it looked really entertaining. You got Tom Cruise and Jon Voight, some cool action, it looked pretty entertaining. What really got my attention, unfortunately, was the backlash that it got from actors of the original series, with one walking out of the theater and still proclaimed it as a terrible movie until his death. This...this should be fun.There is one way to describe the effects of this movie: dated. Really, really dated. The effects, especially during the train sequence don't look good or convincing today. Plus, I'm convinced that the IMF is either blind or stupid. The whole movie is set off due to one plot point about the leadr (Voight)getting killed, though we later found out he did it himself. I think everyone in the audience could tell that his hand was curved. Who are you fooling, really?With that said, I will give it credit that Cruise was really good in this (even though he looked like Wynona Rider from Alien Resurrection) and the one scene that everyone remembers (the highwire scene) is DEFINITELY the coolest. No effects were used and to this day, it will still make you clench your buttcheeks and pause your breathing. In other words, it was really awesome.Bottom line, while there are some really cool things in here, this movie is kinda...eh. Not good or bad...just eh.",7,0,0,5 October 2015
