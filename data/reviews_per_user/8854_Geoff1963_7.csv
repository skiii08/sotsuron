Blade Runner 2049," Very, very good
","It really is very, very good. I saw it only in 2-D, IMAX and 4DX are probably even better. There are a few references back to the original ; so it is probably worth seeing or re-seeing ( one of the many ) versions of that first.Can't say much more without spoiling anything.",10,1,8,7 October 2017
Passengers," Definitely worth seeing
","'Passengers' takes place on a spaceship, travelling for 120 years, at half the speed of light, to a new planet. Before criticising the science, think of how far our knowledge and technology have advanced in the last hundred or thousand years ; and extrapolate that forward, to whenever the movie is supposed to be set. Imagine Shakespeare's company performing Titanic, The Longest Day, or Apollo 13 ; and how the critics of his day would have panned the implausible science. Either put your scepticism aside, or let it spoil your enjoyment.When Jim is woken from hibernation, 90 years before reaching their destination, he is certain to be dead before they arrive. Faced with a lifetime of solitary confinement, he contemplates suicide, but can't go through with it ; so instead considers waking one of the other passengers. To all the critics and posters who say he did the wrong thing, try to imagine his position ; not only no physical contact with friends, but no messages, and not even the interaction with guards that a prisoner has. This article gives an insight : http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/03/30/hellhole Even if we, in our socially-rich circumstances, think he should have accepted his fate ; we should at least recognise he had 'diminished responsibility' when he made the choice.Waking Aurora doesn't condemn her to the same fate of solitude, but instead to a lifetime with someone she might not have chosen, in a place she might not have chosen ; bad, but nowhere near as bad. Having forced her into a new life plan, he then sets about trying to make the best of it ; to make her time with him so good, that if she could wind back the clock, she would have made the choice that he made for her. Perhaps that is the only possible way, to measure if he atoned for his action. The way the two main characters interact, is very engaging ; and there is enough action and danger to spice up what is otherwise 'just' a love story.BIG SPOILER BELOWIf you prefer an unhappy ending, as you are leaving the theatre, trip over and fall flat on your face.",10,71,131,29 December 2016
A Quiet Place," 'Edge of Tomorrow' - with subtitles
","Emily Blunt takes on aliens again ; but this time as the mother of a small family on an isolated farm, and with no military hardware.
Most of the 'dialogue' is signed by the actors, with subtitles for the rest of us. The back story is cleverly provided through newspaper cuttings ; but we don't really need to know how the aliens arrived, only that they have taken over. For a horror film, there isn't too much gore, in the UK it was only a 15 certificate ; some of the most intense moments are the dangers of normal life.
Don't buy popcorn, you'll be too scared of making a noise ; and when you leave the cinema, any loud sound will make you jump.",10,2,5,13 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Best Star Wars yet
","If you are thinking of going to see it, just go ; don't read any reviews, including this one.If you aren't sure ; then if you enjoyed any of the others, you'll like this one too, probably more.",10,4,11,14 December 2017
12 Strong," A good and thought-provoking war film
","The film opens with the terrorist acts up to 9/11, and fleshes out the soldiers who are being sent in response. ( I was reminded of the 'Doolittle Raid', in response to the attack on Pearl Harbour. )There is plenty of action, from small-arms up to air-dropped bombs ; and enough emotion and plot ( supported by text ) to explain what is going on. If it were fiction, it would be good enough ; but knowing it was based on real-life events, adds extra depth.Chris Hemsworth gives a very powerful performance as the leader of the '12', 'writing the book' on that type of operation as he goes along ; although William Fichtner also deserves honourable mention as Colonel Mulholland.",10,19,42,31 January 2018
The Greatest Showman," Very entertaining
","It may not be historically accurate ; I doubt that PT Barnum and his family and employees, actually burst into song quite that often. Look very closely, and perhaps there is the odd technical goof ; but if that is why you go to the cinema, then maybe you should lighten up.It thought it was very entertaining, but also had enough : drama, romance, and morality.",10,1,3,16 January 2018
Midway," Excellent
","Definitely worth seeing. If you don't know the history beforehand ; don't read it up until afterwards, to avoid too many spoilers.",10,6,9,21 November 2019
