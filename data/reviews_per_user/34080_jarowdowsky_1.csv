Requiem for a Dream," Stunned
","I just saw Requiem for a Dream and I'm kicking myself for putting it off for so long. I found it as stunningly inventive as Pi and filled with far more emotional impact. The compassion towards the characters in the film and the honesty of the performances created a devastating and uplifting experience. Whilst the film plumbed the depths of human experience it also remaining cathartic and passionate. Never for one moment did the usual illusion of film emotions or resolutions such as redemption, heroism or even that specialised Hollywood hope interfere with who these people were. I finished watching the film and felt so glad to be alive, to be happy and to be able to make the choices the characters avoided. An absolute must see and the only question left unanswered is how does a money hungry, banal Hollywood film industry see this and think... ah, yes the next Batman director.",10,0,0,16 August 2001
