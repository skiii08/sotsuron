The Sound of Music," A brief Sound of Music panegyric.
","The best ever film, without a doubt, in my mind. It has everything, and it picks you up whenever you need it. I can be at the depths of despair and this movie will fill me with sunshine. There is not a thing wrong with it and I am eternally inspired by everyone involved in the production. It has made me happy and I will pass the joy of it through generations.",10,1,7,29 November 2000
Moulin Rouge!," A sensational explosion of passion and postmodernism!
","This film is not only brilliantly aware of its own fictionality but inspires you to go about what you do with passion. We should all put as much work into our projects as Baz Luhrmann does. Every single person involved in the production of the film was absolutely stunning. 'Moulin Rouge' blew me away with its whirl of colour, sound and emotion.",10,0,1,3 June 2001
