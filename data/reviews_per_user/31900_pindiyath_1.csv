The Legend of Bagger Vance," What a movie!
","Until I watched this movie, I didn't even know the basic rules of Golf. I did read about the recent hits of Tiger Woods but in order to understand the game I had to buy a book & learned it. By all means this movie didn't disappoint me at all. I'm big fan of Will Smith & I wasn't that familiar with this guy Matt Damon. However I found Damon very much interesting. Smith on the other hand did the usual stuff. The photography is really stunning. Robert Redford once again proved that he's one of a kind when it comes to direction.Go for it guys. You won't regret it. I would give this movie 8 out of 10",Null,0,1,13 February 2002
