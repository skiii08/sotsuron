The Benchwarmers," This movie is a waste of your time and money
","Where do you begin on rating such a lousy movie. This movie is a waste of your time and money. Do not go see this movie. This is not a movie that should even be rated pg13. That rating is too mild for this movie. It was extremely offensive in every way. The humor was purely gross and sets bad examples for kids even 14 and over on what is funny. The scene where they had the bench warmers practicing their batting by riding in a truck whacking mail boxes in a neighborhood, sends a message to teens that this practice is acceptable behavior. ALL of the sexual innuendo throughout the film was unnecessary and crossed the line. There was no reason to introduce any sexual innuendo in this movie. A scene where one of the coaches on the other team opens his front door of his house with his gay male lover barely dressed and then repeatedly showing the continuing saga of this relationship throughout the movie was reprehensible...totally unnecessary to the movie. Besides all this, it was extremely disgusting to watch on several occasions throughout the movie people farting, vomiting in somebody else's face, picking noses (and eating them). Nevermind the fact that in another scene they show an agoraphobic and effeminate man handing a 2 liter bottle of urine to his brother. Another scene in the movie, demonstrates to kids that drinking is OK-----the scene shows a man somewhere around the age of 30-40, masquerading as a 13 year old in order to play ball. The movie producers show this man drinking while waiting to play and while he was playing ball. This was very offensive.",1,24,48,8 April 2006
