Hereditary," It had so much potential but faild on the way
","This is going to be one weired review.
Looked forward to this movie so much. I popped my popcorn, waited until dark and all I felf for the first 80 minutes was boredom. It was so slow. It was a good story, but too slow. You don't put on a horrormovie and wait 80 minutes to get some kind of scary wibe. The only good thing with the slowmotion is that you have time to catch all the little dots that connects it all, but I bet some people missed them because they were thinking about what they would do afterwards because they were bored.
The script/story was amazing! All the dots connected and it was easy to catch them all up if you could pay attention the whole time. The acting was really good. Already knew that Toni Collette knew her stuff, but I didn't knew that Alex Wolff could do a role like this so I'm impressed.
The effects was really good, the scenery was really good, it was very very nice directed and so on - but still I felt bored. 
The movie had every potential for a 10/10. Everything with the movie was perfect, but the movie it self were too slow. I would love to recomend the movie to others, but I already know that most of them probably will turn it off within the first hour.",6,0,2,23 August 2018
Us," It's an okay movie...
","I think the movie was okay. I felt like the movie involved to much thinking about what I just saw that I almost forgot to keep watching or to be focused enough to get scared. If I saw it alone I would paused it like 20 times so I had the time to google everything.
I did expect this from Jordan Peele after 'Get out', but it felt like 'Us' had too many twists to keep up. This might be my tired ADHD-brain talking, but in 20 minutes on google I've read about 9 different theories about what I just saw and I think that we are all asking ourselves what we just saw.",6,1,2,24 May 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Not a movie about Queen
","I loved the movie, but I don't think they should call it a movie about Queen when it was mostly about Freddie Mercury. I mean I just saw the movie and I can't even remember the last name of the other three guys in the band. I remember that I looked at my watch half way through the movie to see how much time I had left to enjoy the movie because I wanted more and I still want more. I laugh and I cried, but mostly I just sat with a smile enjoying the movie.
I think that Freddie would be honored if he would be able to watch the movie and I think he would like that it's about his music and not his death.
I also think Rami was amazing! I never saw the guy playing the hacker Elliot in Mr. Robot dancing around in Freddies outfits and make it look beliaveble. Rami is a brilliant actor and a perfect Freddie, every move and word in the movie was so thought through. All the hand gestures, covering the overbite with his lips, walking, talking were so believeble.
I think that Rami Malek got an Oscar nomination coming his way.",8,2,5,1 November 2018

Can't wait to watch it again and embrace it all once again.",8,0,2,1 November 2018
Midsommar," Worth every second of waiting...
","Been waiting for this for a while now and it was worth every second. It was brilliant! As a Swede that celebrated midsommar many times I thought that this movie would make us look even more stuiped, we already dance around a pole like frogs once a year. But this movie was intelligent, brutal and everything I expected after Ari's last masterpiece. Even if there were parts when I felt a little bored I would'nt take any scenes away because they needed to be there to make the movie whole.
Can't wait to see it again.",10,1,6,25 September 2019
Joker," It smells like an Oscar...
","It felt more like a movie about mental illness than something connected to a superhero universe. This doesn't make it bad, just unexpected.
The main thing that bothered me was his age. The Joker will be retired before Bruce become Batman. Also felt like he was a little too stuiped to be able to do the stuff the Joker does.
But if you take the thought away from anything you knew about the Joker before watching the movie it was perfection. Joaquin really made you feel pity for the Joker and really made you feel the ups and downs of his character. If he doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this I would be suprised.",8,0,3,22 October 2019
