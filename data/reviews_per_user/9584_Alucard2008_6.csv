Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good Kids movie....
","You have to understand that I am a old school star wars fan. I am 29 years old and my first film seen in the theater was Return of the Jedi.That said, when i heard a prequel to the original trilogy was coming out, I couldn't wait. Some friends and i took the day of from work, and went to the first show on opening day in our town.Looking at it from an old school fan's point of view I didn't find what i was looking for, the same magic of the original. What i saw was a poor story concept , unbelievable good special effects, and a light saber duel that will blow you away.I have a problem with the story, first of all I rolled my eyes when Qui-gon asks Anikin's mother who Anikin's father is, and she answers there was no father. In another words Ankin is Jesus Christ in a Galaxy far far away ? Come on, that was kinda lame. Also the whole concept that the FORCE is microscopic life forms constantly speaking, to us , telling us the will of the force...*rolls eyes again. What was wrong with the original explanation in star wars...the Force is a energy field that surrounds all living things.... Also its pretty clear if you watched the original 3 movies that senator Palpatine is going to be the emperor...I mean my star wars toy figure back then was called EMPORER PALPATINE....So that whole 'Mystery' on who is the dark lord of the sith was kinda cheap.I do have to say that the light saber duel is incredible. By far makes the original trilogy sword fights look like there in slow motion. Ray parks the stuntman who had little to say but could wield a double bladed light saber like no tomorrow impressed me beyond belief. Ewan McGregor as young Obi-Wan likewise, excellent.I also enjoyed Liam Nealson as Qui-gon Jin. But on the flip side I wish i could erase Jar jar binks (the CG character) from my memory =P On a side note my young nephew who never saw the original trilogy loved this film. I saw that same look in his eye that i had when i saw return of the Jedi, complete and utter awww at movie making magic. So Lucas does succeed in introducing the star wars universe to a new generation. Also when my nephew later watched the original movies with me, he said they where OK...But looked so Old...I could tell he was not impressed with them as much as he was with phantom menace.However I'm sure many old school fans can only frown and wish for more, as we are grown up...and where desperately hoping for a film that would spark that youthful magic in us again...",6,0,1,7 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Orignaly titled REVENGE of the Jedi
","Its debatable which was the better film Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. I am part of the crowd that votes for Empire. However Don't get me wrong this film is excellent as well.Luke returns and his Jedi training is nearly complete. 'only one task remains...Vader, you must confront Vader, only then a Jedi will you be'. This is no small task considering Luke Lost his hand and his first fight to Vader in the second film. Not to mention Yoda confirms Luke's worst fear...Vader is his father! The emperor sets up a trap for the Rebel alliance baiting them into a battle, that threatens to crush there already rag tag fleet.For the First time we are treated to a 3 pronged battle sequence at the end. The rebels in space trying to take out the new death star with a fleet of imperial ships on there tail, Han and Leia on the ground moon of Endor trying to destroy the shield generator that is blocking the rebel ships from destroying the death star, And Luke Facing Vader as the emperor watches in Glee, goading him to use the dark side of the force and replace Vader as his servant! 'I can feel the hate swelling in you now'.The incredible special effects of the star ship battles are amplified X 10 in what you have previously seen. All the loose ends of the story are answered here. The fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance.My only complaint when it was all over....You mean...this was the last one ? there not making a 4th film ? Saying goodbye to some of my most favorite characters in film was hard to do ^^",9,1,2,7 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Light saber is Quicker then the eye....
","The second installment of the prequel Trilogy telling the story of young Anikin's Decent into the dark side of the force.First off I want to say that I think Hayden Chirstensen did an excellent job of portraying Anikin in this film. In fact, I wish we could have skipped over the whole Kidie version from Phantom menace (Jake Loyd) and just focused on Hayden through all three films.Likewise Natalie Portman as senator Amidala gets her awkward Orientel like geisha wannabe outfits put behind her and allowed to show her talented face.They also did a great job aging Ewan McGreggor into a older Obi-wan. McGregor plays Obi Wan Perfectly in my mind.The romantic scenes developed in this movie between Senator Amidala and Ankin are Awkward at best. I do not blame this on the actors they did the best they could with the poor dialog choices. I dunno , I don't see the magic here, all i see is a montage of thrown together scenes that Looked like some bad 80's movie with sci if paint.I also had a problem with one of the most important moments in the trilogy....When Anikin's mother dies in his arms from being held prisoner over the last few months by the sand people. Anikin goes on a rampage and slaughters the entire village with his light-saber. The scene Sounds great....But Lucas makes it cheap by not showing it. You hear the light saber swwosh and sand people dying and Cut to a new scene before we can show you the real rage....all so we can get a PG rating and keep the kiddie tickets flowing in. But Older fans, ya know the ones that watched the original trilogy back in 77 ....Where not kids I think we can handle PG-13 don't you ???All that said and done, The special effects are amazing. The last 30 min of the movie is phenomenal in choreographed Special effects candy that make Phantom menace look like a cheap b-movie.I also enjoyed Obi-Wan's fight scene against Jengo-Fet in the rain, and I like how all these events with Jengo tie in to his sons actions in empire stirkes back, in the old trilogy.On another sour note, the light saber duels * cough Lame. I'm talking about Obi-wan and then Anikin against Count Dookoo. They kept showing anikin with 2 light sabers in the trailers, And i thought thats gonna be so cool. But I'm the theater I was so disappointed. We are treated to Scenes of Anikin and Dooko Close up face view with a glow of light-sabers flashing,(we can hear th sound of them clashing but not y being scene)....They move so fast you cant see it!!!! *rolls eyes, Come on people the Dual in phantom menace was asome....What happened ??? Of chorse this is balanced out by Yoda coming out and kicking some ass. I was laughing and cheering for this part of the movie, pure joy.Over all I give this a slightly higher rating then phantom menace, mostly because Portman and Hayden bring much more depth to the film then the first movie.",7,1,1,8 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The one we all have been waiting for....
","The third installment of the prequel trilogy, showing Anikins decent into the dark side of the force.Lucas succeeds in bringing us a visual action packed monster of a film.Definitely the darkest of the three prequel movies, but really still a kids movie in my book.What don't i like about this one, takes a moment to think....OK The dialog, severely lacking once again. An example of this is Ankins dramatic fight with his mentor Obi-Wan. Obi wan screaming at him, but you where the chosen one almost sounded like Mommy I want that toy really bad whaaaa *flood of tears < Que the guy with the eye droper> Also there whole debate over politics in there saber fight *rolls eyes in boredom. In my mind they should have been addressing the real issue, That Obi-Wan and others where so consumed with everything else that they disregarded anikins dreams of his mother dying, which lead to current issues about senator amidala dying. I mean wasn't that why we had that whole scene in attack of the clones, to show ankins problems with dealing with death ? Do we really care about the political BS ? I'm sorry but if your going to the dark side and back it should be over love or something real.I truly liked the idea of the chicken or the egg ( Anikin dreams of a future where Senator amidala Dies through complications at child birth. *however by the end of the film we learn that the complications where because of her sadness over anikin falling to the dark side* However Anikin goes to the dark side because regular Jedi training cant save her so he chooses the dark side* but if he never chose the dark side, those complications would not have come up, but if.....Well you get the idea.Obi-Wans battle with the leader of the droid army, after a great chase scene on a giant Iguana rocks ! Why couldn't we have more original stuff like this ???I also enjoyed Yoda's Stand against the emperor,complete with them hurling the Senate floor hover discs at each other.Sweet!As i have said, about the previous two films I find these lacking to the original trilogy from an old school fan's point of view. However I also think children or people who never saw the original trilogy will enjoy these more then old school fans which is why i rate them slightly higher then normal. (And when i say old school I mean the NORMAL old school fans ) Not the ones who stood camping the ticket booth days ...no weeks before release..lol",7,1,2,8 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," In a Galaxy far far away...
","Mark Hamil plays Luke Skywaker, a young man working his uncle's moisture farm on the planet of Tatoonie, who dreams of becoming a pilot and joining the rebel alliance. 'If there's a bright center of the universe, your on the planet that is farthest from'.Carrie Fisher plays Princes Leia from Alderan, who is part of the rebel alliance, a renegade movement seeking to overthrow the Evil empire which is the current government, that is run like a dictator ship. 'The more you tighten your grip, the more star systems slip through your fingers'.Harison Ford plays the Smuggler Han Solo, who Runs illegal activities for the gangster Hutts. A man who seems only in any adventure for the reward he is promised, turns out to have true heart.James Earl Jones plays a villain who uses the Dark side of the force wielding a red light saber. 'A young pupil of mine until he turned to evil, betrayed and murdered your father'.Underneath the grand space ship battles, the light saber duels , and the incredible imagination of George Lucas, beats a simple story that almost anyone young or old can relate to. A movie you can watch with your kids or something you can see with your friends. Its even a good date movie, with sparks flying between Han solo and the princess, just about anyone who gives this movie a chance will enjoy it.Even when they released the 'Speical edition' in theaters several years later, The special effects upgrade to make the film more current didn't impress me that much. What did impress me was that adrenalin rush I felt for a second time, when Luke is aiming for that vulnerable place on the death star and Lord Vader is closing in ready to destroy him, all to the beat of an incredible score by Jhon Williams. This movie brings back all the joy i had seeing it as a kid and growing up with it, and to me thats the most imprecise thing a film can do, is stand up to Time.",8,1,2,7 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Why can't all second films be this good ?
","The whole crew from the Star Wars returns for the second installment in the trilogy.Few second films can live up to or even reach what the first film accomplished so well but the empire strikes back pulls it off.Some time has passed since Luke destroyed the death star. Now he is a commander and leads an elite fighter squadron for the rebel alliance. However visions from his old mentor Obi-wan Kinobi Urge him to seek out the Jedi master Yoda, to learn the ways of the force.Meanwhile Princess Leia and Han Make a desperate run to find a safe port to make repairs , while Lord Vader uses every means possible to hunt them down.I actually rate this film higher then star wars mostly for the incredible cliff hangers at the end. Which left those of us who saw it in the theater, waiting a few years to answer the question....Could it be true...Lord Vader is ........? How are they gonna save Han ??? Fortunetly for those renting this on DVD its only a day away to find the answer in 'Return of the Jedi' =PYou know how most sequels tend to be a bigger, better, fattier budget version of the original ? while thats true of empire, empire also offers a bigger Heart at the center of the story, making it much more personal this time around.",10,1,2,7 February 2006
