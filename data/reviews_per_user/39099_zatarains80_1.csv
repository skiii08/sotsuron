Marie Antoinette," Excellent...I have a craving for CAKE now!
","The only thing 'wrong' about this film is that there is no time measurement, especially since I suspect that many are unfamiliar with the time line of historical events--and I wish there had been more identification of Marie Antoinette's entourage and clique...NOW....Sofia Coppola's biopic of Marie Antoinette is wonderful! It follows the young dauphine and queen of France from about the age of 14 until her late 20s when she is captured during the Revolution. It demonstrates Marie Antoinette's isolated life, she is living in a royal cocoon and how she carefully navigates the precarious French court at Versailles.Kirsten Dunst does well in her portrayal of the young queen as she deals with an unconsummated marriage (for seven years); the pressures of needing to deliver an heir; and how her marriage-bed relations could ultimately effect the delicate alliances between France and Austria. Her spending is extravagant but so is her unique situations.Filmed mostly on location in Versailles, it is BEAUTIFULLY done--the costumes are wonderful! I was worried about the 'modern' soundtrack but that was not overpowering and it was well timed. Check out the recent PBS documentary--it rocks! Enjoy!",8,1,3,28 October 2006
