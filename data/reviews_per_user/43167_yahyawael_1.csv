Conquest 1453," Me as a muslim not turkish I find the movie is directed.
","This movie isn't made from a Muslim perspective it is made from a historical , neutral and secular perspective. And also they interested in the characters that are not essential at the expense of the main characters. Also mahemed the hero sounded weak and the main event is quickly skipped. The Islamic scenes was very few. but at least a movie for Muslims important events not from the side of Crusaders like Dracula untold and the kingdom of heaven.",6,0,0,7 June 2020
