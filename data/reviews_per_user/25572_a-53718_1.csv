Vertigo," Amazing Masterpiece
","Hitchcock's Vertigo is stunning. This film is a textbook that the tutor taught us on the directing course. To be honest, I didn't know much about films before completing my film production degree, but Hitchcock's works are the cornerstone for me to explore the deeper meaning of all aspects. From the narrative perspective, the suspense built up in such a natural but thrilling way, the twist in the middle is brilliant. From the visual standpoint, a creative feature is a colour representing a particular meaning, the more times I watch, the more I appreciate this brilliant masterpiece. It's worth learning.",9,2,3,28 September 2017
