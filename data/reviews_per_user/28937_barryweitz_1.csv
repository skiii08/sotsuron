United 93," Exceptionally well-crafted depiction of one of the most difficult topics to film
","This film shows all the hallmarks of an exceptional film-maker. Told in documentary style using real people rather than actors in important scenes it has the air of reality which is so often lacking in dramas, real or imagined. The stark facts regarding the inability of the military to act are so shocking that I would very unhappy to allow the US military to defend my country, The UK.The fact that CNN was the main conduit for news of what was happening on the ground is also a sad reflection of the sorry state the USA finds itself.The camera-work and editing are just about the nearest you will get to perfection in this area, and all those concerned on the technical side should be applauded. Well done , Paul Greengrass, The Producers and The studios for making this film happen. BJW.",9,2,5,12 July 2006
