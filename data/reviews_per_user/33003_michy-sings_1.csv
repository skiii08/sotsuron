Stop-Loss," Good Movie, but sad.
","I have a friend who is fighting the war in Iraq and it once again hit home with me what exactly our troops are doing over there. They're fighting for our country of course, but also they're fighting just to stay alive.This movie was well made, but it went deeper than just a 'war'. The true underlying theme to this movie is friendship, camaraderie and doing the right thing in the face of evil or horrible circumstances.This movie will draw on some strong emotions and it's truly not a feel-good movie, but I think it's worth the watch anyway. Most of the actors in this film were OK, but Channing Tatum was wonderful, even though he wasn't on the screen as much as I'd like. I probably won't see this movie again because it left me with this upset feeling hanging over my head and it was the same for every one else I spoke with while leaving the theater.",7,2,5,4 April 2008
