Howl's Moving Castle," Mostly, I did not enjoy this movie.
","I did not like this movie because it was hard to follow. I think the movie would have been a whole much better if Sofi, the main character, did not change almost every different scene. I also did not like the plot very much.The plot was hard to follow because there was a door that opened up to four different places.When someone knocked on the door they turned to the color-coded-place and happened to know which place the person was knocking from. I am sure my friends, who were watching Hauru no ugoku shiro with me, did not enjoy this movie entirely. I am not against the movie, but there are some holes the could have covered up. I liked the Japanese animation. So if you like anime and manga, this is a great movie for you.",2,10,23,15 April 2006
Finding Nemo," BEST Disney MOVIE!
","I believe this an amazing movie. Not only did this movie have a long process, it was worth it. There are many animated films, but I believe this one to be the best.The animated graphics of this movie are so good. This movie had 4 different layers of animation. The quality of the graphics is so admirable that it was being produced for six years! When you are watching this movie, you don't even notice that the graphics are marvelous because your mind is set on the wonderful plot.If you are looking for a movie with a great plot and tremendous graphics, then this is the family movie you are looking for. This movie is excellent for all ages.",10,1,3,25 October 2006
