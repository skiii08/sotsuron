Black Swan," Lacks tension, grit, emotionless and well... just too pat.
","I am so glad other people agree that this film, no, movie was so poor. Awful empty emotions, where was the dramatic tension?? The grit that this movie required. I saw the images but where were the emotions that were supposed to go with with them. All looks and no substance. Take away the superficial bloody scenes finger skin ripping, stabbing in the face etc, its rather clumsy and crammed to be horror, psychological thriller, drive-ambition, neurotic. All of a sudden her legs break in to a swan shape and she actually starts to become a swan. The movie becomes a farce. The character doesn't have time to breath. To mentally break down slowly. A little by little. This really could have been a great film but...it's just pretty.The ending wasn't satisfying, yeah she transformed, yeah she danced the black swan really well, yeah she kissed the guy..OK and. I didn't feel it, I didn't believe it. I wasn't transformed in to her world, I didn't care about her, I wasn't engaged. Mila Kunis stole the film. She was so watchable.Oh yeah..hey kids you wanna BE GREAT...then self abuse, use drugs and murder. (As if you guys didn't know that).Oscar Nomination!! Oh my God how poor the standard in Hollywood is now. Truly satisfying Films are now found in the foreign Oscar nominations section (and have done for some time) these are the ones that stay with you, days weeks after. Oh mighty Hollywood what has happened to you? Why has TV(Soprano's, Mad Men,The Wire. For the ladies Desperate House Wives, The Good Wife, etc) become the new you? Oh Hollywood when shall I see you rise again? For when you shine, you truly shine, so bright one can't look in to your eyes. They hurt ever so sweetly that they bring tears. The Little Miss Sunshine's and Sideways are all too few.",2,0,2,25 January 2011
