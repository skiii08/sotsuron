Catch Me If You Can," I read the book book first. Movie is OK.
","I read the book several years ago and couldn't put it down. Fascinating story.Even though most movies don't compare to the book(not this one either), I still found the movie entertaining(especially Christopher Walken who has such presence. It is all in his eyes).Without trashing Leo(a great actor), I must say that I found the choice to use him as Frank quite ironic, having read the book.This is because one of the main themes in the book was the fact that Frank looked older than he was, and that fact as well as the way he carried himself allowed him to pass himself off the way he did.That having been said, someone with a baby face like Leo seems a strange choice for Frank.Nevertheless, the movie was still worth seeing and I recommend it.",Null,0,0,28 December 2002
