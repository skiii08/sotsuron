Requiem for a Dream," Triple Thumbs Up (Definitly would if i have a third)
","A very Amazing Movie, something i haven't come across for a long time in our all-star, big-buck Hollywood movies. I'd recommend it to any and all who enjoys a good movie with unique point-of-view shoots and deep mesmerizing meanings to life to pounder upon, even after hours finishing. Every scene is direct and captivating; almost like a bullet shooting out to all your senses.The whole idea of 'drug is bad for you' has long been lessons for our health ed class; but aside from this, the director intelligently snuggled many more of society immoralities into the scenes.Rather than spoiling, I'd just say to all 'Watch It'; and i'm sure you'll be in for 'wow's like the way i am now!",9,2,3,23 November 2008
