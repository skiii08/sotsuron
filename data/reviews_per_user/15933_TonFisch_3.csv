Blade Runner 2049," An odd one
","I went into this knowing barely anything.
First impression were 'Lot of grey' and 'There is rain in the future'.Without many words a story gets shown, not told, shown. Some movies get this wrong and try to be an audiobook with visuals, not this one. You could probably watch without sound and still understand everything.Visually stunning, not much more to say.The audio is a different story. No idea if this has to do with the bluray, but the levels varied from 'cant hear a thing' to 'that is loud'. When you dont know what an audio compressor is, you are not alone, neither did the sound designer! I found myself reaching for the remote more often than I should to adjust volume up or down.Apart from volume levels varying too much, very nice experience.",8,1,5,30 March 2019
Interstellar," A Sci-Fi movie that makes sense
","<ul><li>Soundtrack is amazing</li><li>Realistic, 2001-ish space happenings</li><li>Story without potholes</li></ul>It is a fantastic movie!
No other way to say it.
The soundtrack fits the scenes, scenes that are well writen, acted in a natural manner filling a story that just makes sense.",10,0,1,28 February 2019
