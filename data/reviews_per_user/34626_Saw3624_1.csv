United 93," The most powerful movie of our time...
","When I was watching United 93, I felt like I was in the movie. Paul Greengrass did a SUPERB job with it. It felt very real. I was crying throughout the whole thing. It is beautiful. Truly beautiful. This is one of the most important films of our time. It is also the most moving and emotional one of our time. This movie shows how a group of random people stuck together and helped reroute the hijacking of their plane. It is amazing how this movie was made. ...I know this review didn't have many things to say, that is only because i am SO speechless. Unbelievable.God bless America!",10,5,11,29 April 2006
