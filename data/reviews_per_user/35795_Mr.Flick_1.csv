The Blair Witch Project," Intelligent, Truly Scary Film
","Those who think that 'The Blair Witch Project' is not truly horrific have not given the film enough thought. The movie is not scary by conventional terms, but builds its horror and suspense on a more psychological level. The final shot of the movie, while a tad ambigous and question-raising, is there for a reason. Viewers who are thoughtful and attentive enough will make the connection between that final chilling shot and a line of dialogue that is stated near the beginning of the film. Once I made the connection between these two crucial points (which was about an hour after I'd seen the film), I was chilled to the bone. Sleeping was nearly impossible the night I saw the film, and I must now honestly say I've never seen a movie as bleakly horrific as 'The Blair Wit",10,1,2,2 August 1999
