Casablanca," One of the greatest
","This is one of the greatest movies ever made.  It transcends time.  The script is just pure poetry.  Sure, some of the supporting actors are a little stiff but Bogart and Bergman have a chemistry that has never been captured on screen again.  The ending is the best 15 minutes of film ever. Anyway, can't say enough for this movie. Chris",Null,1,1,16 September 2002
Signs," It was great
","I saw Signs recently and thought the movie was worth seeing in the theater. It had all the suspense, character development, and cinematography.  My only complaint is that at first there seemed to be some holes in the logic and plot.  I read a lot of the other comments and other people seemed to have the same complaints.  Then I thought maybe M. Knight intended to make people think 'why did they do that?', 'why didn't the aliens have this?', and so forth instead of wrapping it all up in a pretty little package (how boring).I must admit that it had my imagination working for hours after seeing it (that's what a good movie should do).  So, here are my theories to the questions my friends and I were asking after watching the movie.**Spoiler** Why didn't the aliens have weapons?  Why would the aliens leave there 'wounded' behind?  Why would water burn the aliens like acid does to humans? Why would they give up so easily?  Why couldn't they figure out how to get out of a pantry? Well, my theory is that the aliens we saw were not the true evolved alien life that could travel light years to other planets.  I think they were genetically engineered creatures used by the intelligent aliens for one thing and that is gathering information about enemies.  That's why the aliens in the space ships would just leave them on the planet and not worry about saving them.  One thing that holds true in our armed forces is you never leave a man behind.  Equipment, weapons, whatever else is expendable so we would leave it behind without caring about it.  However, we try to disable the weapons so they can't be used against us.  This is where the 'dissolves in water' comes into play.  What's the best way to get rid of your weapons on a planet that is 75% water?  By having them dissolve in water.  Therefore, there is no evidence and no way we can study them to prepare for another attack.  And of course don't give these engineered soldiers a freaking phasor gun or any other advanced equipment.  That's the last thing the alien race wants is for us to get our hands on one of those guns and reverse engineer it and be able to attack them back.So, in conclusion, I think it makes perfect sense for an alien race that is so intelligent, advanced in technology, and I'm sure wise in the art of war to genetically engineer slave humanoid soldiers who have no intelligent thoughts other than knowing how to gather information and then attack when given the order. Then strategically place these soldiers around the world to study each culture of the humans to see what makes them work, what weapons humans have, how they handle attacks, and discover our weaknesses.  Yet don't give these aliens any form of weapons or advanced technology beyond what humans already have (hence, they used radio waves to communicate just like we do, used primitive crop designs to tell the ships where they are hiding on earth so they will know where to pick them up, and gave their soldiers no weapons or clothing or anything that would further our knowledge of their technology and culture).  Then have these mindless creatures attack us for one night to see how strong we are and also to kidnap some humans to study.  Then leave quickly with your new found knowledge of the humans only to return after years of study of the kidnapped humans and then attack in full force knowing everything about our biology, history, and culture.  But what about the 'soldiers' they left behind?  Who cares, they will dissolve on the next rainfall anyway and they have nothing on them that will educate the humans on what the true aliens are or their weaknesses. That's just what I think anyway. Great movie, keep them coming.... Chris",Null,0,1,22 August 2002
