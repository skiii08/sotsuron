Sucker Punch," What's really real in Sucker Punch?
","A lot of the conventional wisdom on Sucker Punch is that it's entertaining and loaded with eye-candy, but that it lacks a coherent story or character development and may even pander to the sexual exploitation that it appears to decry. I'd say the reviewers who came to those conclusions missed a pretty good movie.Sucker Punch is like Fight Club - the whole movie is in the last few minutes. Also like Fight Club, it's an open question how much of the action is real and even how many of the characters and settings are real (in the context of the movie). We can begin by assuming that the video game sequences in which the girls fight giants and zombies and demons and robots are fantasy sequences, real only in the sense that fantasy is a real part of the life of the mind (and this is one of the themes of the movie that's easy to miss).Conversely, we can assume that the bus and bus stop at the end of the movie are real in the context of the movie, that Sweet Pea really gets on a real bus (although maybe not, and without that assumption the movie is a vastly darker one). Is the asylum real? The staff and the lobotomy doctor are dressed in the style of the Sixties, but the bus stop was modern day.Is the nightclub real? Most of the asylum characters are entirely different people in the nightclub, excepting the kitchen and the cook which are the same in both. But the 'unreal' nightclub is where some of the girls are killed. So were they really killed? Or were they really real (in the context of the movie) to begin with? Consider how we meet Sweet Pea, in a role-playing session on a stage set pretty much identically to the first view we saw of Baby Doll's room at home. Sweet Pea then stops the lobotomy scene (which is also shifted to a theatrical scene on the 'stage,' this time in the club) to complain about the incoherence and lack of commercial possibilities in the story (i.e. Baby Doll's story).Is Baby Doll herself really real, or is she a manifestation of a part of Sweet Pea's consciousness? Note how Baby Doll is dressed in the scene outside the asylum when she sacrifices herself so that Sweet Pea can escape. Also, remember the narration at the beginning, about how we find our guardian angels and how they find us.This is a very complicated and interesting movie about consciousness and existentialism and the life of the mind, masquerading as a girl-power action flick. On that level, obviously, it's going to raise more questions than it answers, but it's far from cheap flash and exploitation. Don't sell it short.",8,2,6,7 April 2011
Tropic Thunder," Not just a slapstick spoof - a witty, wicked Hollywood satire
","Over-the-top movie parodies have become a genre all their own, and they come with standard expectations. You expect broad, lowbrow, mostly visual comedy, and you hope that all the big belly-laughs weren't in the trailers. You expect plenty of T&A to fill in the gaps between gags (or between gags that work) and also plenty of good times to check your watch.Tropic Thunder is much smarter than that. It works on the movie parody belly-laugh level if that's all you want, but the gags have other gags hidden inside and budding off in all directions. There's the broad spoof that you paid to see, and there's the 'serious movie' that's even funnier if you pay attention. Every time Tropic Thunder starts to get 'serious,' watch for the really clever bits of satire. If a scene or an exchange between characters seems completely zinger-free, it's just barely possible that the movie is making fun - of you.Because everything is fair game for satire in this comprehensive razz at Hollywood and showbiz, including the audience and its expectations. If Half-Squat and his twig Oscar got an awww out of you - they gotcha. They got the actors, they got the directors, they got the studios, they got the writers, they got every target in sight, and they got them all good. This is a movie where the more times you see it and the more you think about it, the funnier it gets.I suspect this movie is even funnier to showbiz insiders. Some of the gags-within-gags are a little inside, like the discussion about how Blue Ray beat HD-DVD. But in the first place, lots of people are media-savvy nowadays, and in the second place common sense and a little thought will demystify a lot of the inside stuff. For example, it's not hard to imagine that desperate directors who risk the health and safety of their cast and crew because they're behind schedule and over budget are not beloved figures in Hollywood. It's also not hard to imagine that movie-makers don't particularly love TiVO.Anyway, Tropic Thunder so well-conceived, well-written, well-directed, and well-performed that everything works whether it's inside or not. I don't care if Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey) is supposed to be Russell Crowe or a composite of several well-respected method actors. He's hilarious either way. I don't need to know which studio boss Tom Cruise is sending up to love his portrayal of a big shot whose entire job, apparently, is telling people to go f*ck themselves. I love the way the movie avoids the easy stereotype for something funnier (as with Matthew MacConaughey's agent) or plays dueling clich√©s one against the other (as with Nick Nolte's writer).This is not an important movie. This is not a movie that will change your life. But it is a smart, well-made Hollywood satire that will keep you laughing from before it even starts (hint: don't blow off the previews when you see it) through the closing credits.",8,2,7,3 September 2008
