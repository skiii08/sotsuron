Blade Runner 2049," Some of the soundtrack was just wrong, but a great movie
","I don't know why corporations or producers insist on forcing Populist features in movies, but Spinners making jet sounds? NO! Too much racket and forced sound effects. And we needed Vangelis.It's a great movie and I can't wait to see it again, but the theater where I saw it the volume was ear splitting loud and I wanted to leave because of the sound effects. Lighten up guys! The scene where the replicant 'newborn' was dropped on the floor and struggled with the shock of it was remarkable, but many didn't like that she was killed. I know the goal was to make the Wallace character seem more like a Baron Harkonen if you will, but something was missing from it, and I don't think it was the acting that was the problem. There should have been better development and back story to how evil Wallace was. A scene for that was missing.",8,0,5,11 October 2017
