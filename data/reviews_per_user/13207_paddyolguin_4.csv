50 First Dates," A Surprisingly Sweet and Funny Movie
","Like him or not, Adam Sandler is very clever. His wacky over-the-top slap-stick is just a way to get you to laugh before he sticks you in the heart with something completely unexpected and you suddenly end up with tears in your eyes. I rarely buy DVDs, but this (and the Wedding Singer) is a notable exception. The perfect date movie - over and over.I won't repeat the plot-line - read a couple of reviews. What bears noting is Rob Schneider's ridiculous and hilarious supporting role. No Oscar, but he was brilliant.The chemistry between Barrymore and Sandler is easy and natural. And for you Sandler fans, his Lucy song will have you rolling. Sentimental without being sappy, it's a story of a family dealing with a debilitating injury and a tireless guy who's willing to win his girl's affection every day. I don't know how some reviewers see the ending as sad or disappointing. It seemed like an obvious victory of love and devotion over adversity. My wife and I watch this movie over and over. How else would you treat a 10?",10,6,8,15 May 2009
Enchanted," A Family Classic
","Amy Adams is brilliant. The live incarnation of a true Disney animated princess. She is the reason this movie works. It doesn't hurt that Patrick Dempsey is a convincing confused pessimistic divorce attorney, and James Marsden is a stereotypical send-up of all the Disney princes. Disney pays homage to its history of fairy tales lightheartedly (unlike Dreamworks, which goes for the cynical skewering). It's easy to be cynical for a cheap laugh, it's much tougher to be funny and gentle about it and still get away with it, and Enchanted does that.The Happy Working song had me laughing so hard, I was crying. I've seen this four times and it keeps getting better. Bravo, Disney, for making a truly fun film that we can enjoy for years to come. How often can you say that? Amy Adams is a gem.",10,2,2,22 February 2009
Inside Out," Love or Hate, that is the question
","--- There are some spoilers after the 2nd paragraph ---!!Oh the irony. The message of this movie is that we humans need to feel all of our emotions in order to... be human, and yet the reviews fall into only two of those - Joy or Anger. If you are an intuitive empathizing personality, you're going to enjoy this movie. You'll laugh and cry. You'll appreciate 'Joy' for her flaws as well as her positive attitude! As for it being a horrible movie, it obviously isn't to everyone; read all the positive reviews. The people who love it aren't crazy, nor are those who hate it. It's interesting to me that the chief complaint is that it's depressing. What? Didn't you people pay attention to Up, Toy Story 1, 2, 3, Finding Nemo, Cars... any of the PIXAR films you supposedly love? They are chock full of anger, loss, betrayal, death, loneliness, co-dependence, greed, addiction (Fish are Friends, not food!) - all very adult themes. Who didn't cry their eyes out, TWICE, at the end of Toy Story 3? At the beginning of Up? Jessie singing 'When Somebody Loved Me?' Those scenes are gut-wrenching. Dark Themes? Go review the plot lines to Up and Toy Story 3. Seriously.As for Disney/PIXAR stealing stories, I hate to break this to you, but every movie plot since the Seven Samurai has been stolen from a previous story. There are no new plot lines. That is not a valid complaint. The truth is, you liking this movie or not is nearly 100% about you, not PIXAR.-- spoilers --- Inside Out isn't about self-absorption, it's about self-awareness. It's about Joy's misguided mission to keep Riley happy all the time, until she finally realizes that at Riley's turning point, she needs to feel sad, or she risks feeling nothing at all. For anyone who's dealt with depression, we (happily) see this coming, and fully understand that in order for there to be Joy in Riley's life, she has to express/let-go of pain by feeling sad, thus the blue-yellow memory marble of Joy and Pain/Sadness coupled together. But I suppose analytical, emotionally-cutoff viewers were too busy heading for the exits. Too bad. The neurology lesson is fun and creative. Yes, you might have had to pay attention in your Psych 101 class. Don't blame Disney for that.As for it not being a kid movie, my nine-year old son, who has Autism, loved the movie. Seeing emotions vividly illustrated made sense to him.",9,7,32,23 October 2015
Up," PIXAR does it again
","PIXAR has a way of tugging the heart strings without yanking them painfully. Words can't describe the lush artwork and incredible animation that we take for granted. But above all, this movie, along with all the PIXAR greats is about storytelling. Anyone who has loved and lost, who's not quite fulfilled a dream will be deeply affected by the opening montage of Carl's life. I loved this movie.The music. The score is indeed like an additional character in the film, helping set the mood without blatantly telling us how to feel.I don't get reviewers who castigate Disney/PIXAR for being overly dark in this picture. Didn't you people see Bambi? His mother was shot! Snow White - an insane queen kills her with a poisoned apple for crying out loud (ok, she comes back to life with love's first kiss).As for the picture's appropriateness for children, my three-year old watched it transfixed from beginning to end. My only regret is not holding-out for a Blue-Ray player and making this movie my first Disney Blue-Ray.Thank you, PIXAR. I can't wait to see what's UP next.",10,0,2,13 January 2010
