The Ring," Watch out for your TV!
","I saw The Ring four months ago and I still cannot walk by the TV in my bedroom without thinking of Samara.  The film is psychologically disturbing without having to resort to a lot of gore or jump-out-of-your-seat moments. I highly recommend this film to those who like horror of the mind rather than 'slice-em-up' plots.  Don't bother with the book, however.  It's the opposite of scary and very vague.",Null,0,0,20 November 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A crashing bore!
","I know I'm probably in the minority here, but this movie was a lot of hype over nothing.  It's slow, it's tedious, the characters are unsympathetic, and the plot is too predictable.  I didn't care whether Joel and Clementine ever got together again or not, I just wanted out of that theatre.  My husband felt exactly the same way.  Sure Jim Carrey plays a much more serious role here.  The problem is, everything is so low key, it's an exercise in sheer boredom.  The movie also seems to go out of its way to make every character slightly off and every situation rather odd.  Give me a straightforward plot without the artsy crap any day.  Don't waste your ten bucks on this movie.  Wait for the video, and then don't rent that either.",Null,0,1,23 March 2004
Love Actually," Touching, sentimental and a lot of fun!
","A very entertaining movie.  Here's my list of likes and dislikes:         Likes: 1.  Bill Nighy as the Keith Richardsesque rocker is a scream. 2.  Emma Thompson will break your heart. 3.  Hugh Grant...need I say more? 4.  Things keep moving and I never got bored. 5.  I laughed out loud a lot, and I'm a tough audience. 6.  It wasn't overly schmaltzy like American movies often are. 7.  Alan Rickman plays a great crabby middle-aged guy. 8.  Not everyone gets a happy ending. Dislikes: 1.  That weird-looking kid who was Liam Neeson's stepson. 2.  The Laura Linney storyline...like that guy would go for              her anyway.  Please. 3.  Why the sex and nudity scenes???  They were totally              unnecessary, didn't add to the storyline, and prevented me from bringing my 14 year old daughter to an otherwise terrific movie she would have loved. 4.  The wooden acting of Kiera Knightley.  And does that girl ever eat???  She's emaciated.",Null,0,2,21 November 2003
