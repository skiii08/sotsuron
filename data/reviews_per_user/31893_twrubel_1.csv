First Man," Lame
","Perspective is so off, emotionally overwrought between personal vs technological vs political... too confusing and very slow. I can't believe this was nominated for any award. I was emotionally moved and felt it pushed me to think of the complexities of engineering involved. Then I got lost with the lack of focus and so many scenes that had nothing meaning anything, I felt they just needed time to make the movie longer to compete with other movie lengths. The acting is good, Ryan did a great job for what he had to work with, but Claire's wig (or bad haircut) was a distraction. Hidden Numbers blows this movie completely out of the water!",1,3,6,3 February 2019
