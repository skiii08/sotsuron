Ghost," The rules of the game..
","The film really plays up the sappiness of lovers but for romantic die-hards like myself, this is THE movie to rejoice in. I loved the music, the drama of the script, and the emotions that renders a person helpless in watching as the movie unfolds. It may not be for everyone's taste.. but mainly for lovelorns who appreciate a wonderful tale of love lost and found.",10,1,2,13 February 1999
