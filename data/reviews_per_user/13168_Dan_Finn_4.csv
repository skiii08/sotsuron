The New World," This film made me kill my girlfriend, and some nuns, and now I'm going to start a Jehad against the director and i ain't even Muslim!
","I went to see this film with my late girlfriend! after watching this film for 2.5 hours it ended and i suddenly realised that nothing had actually happened throughout! All those people who rated this film as a 10 are pompous, elitist, lier's. They want you to think that you didn't get the film but really there was nothing to get! I'm all for artsy movies but make the scenic shots breath taking and give it some historical merit. I can look at grass puddles and English country manor gardens at home! I went to Queen Elizabeths Grammar school in Alford, Lincolnshire, the same one as Captain John Smith went to, so i know a lot about his life. Pocahontas was just a 10 year old Native Indian Princess who he befriended briefly. And he was not Irish I'm sure of that!!!! This film is just drivel i was so angry that my girlfriend had made me go to watch it, i strangled her in the cinema to kill some time, the nuns were unfortunate witnesses! (its a metaphor don't worry)! Nothing happens at all, the characters don't speak just narrate their thoughts, which are dull. The imagery is just stuff you would see on a documentary about site seeing in Wales. The cinematography was muddled and confusing! AND most of all it was LONG, VERY NEEDLESSLY LONG! I feel dumber since watching The New World i think it destroyed some of my brain cells. To be fair at least 50 people walked out as soon as they realised the whole first half of the film was just going to be repeated in the second half, only set in Britain! I should have left then!!!! Please god why didn't i leave then!!!!",1,5,15,5 February 2006
Iron Man 2," Worth the ticket price but not as good as the first!
","The film was entertaining and i felt like i'd got decent value for my cinema ticket.Downy was great as usual, Rourke was excellent, and Don Cheadle was very good however i would have preferred Howard had reprise his role, he just added that little bit of extra grit to the character.The special effects were amazing, the humour was there, and the action scenes were on the whole excellent.There were two main downsides to the movie that stopped it being an all time great - Scarlett Johansson: a completely pointless role, apart from shots of her in her bra she didn't offer anything to the character, her fight scenes were annoyingly unrealistic and far fetched, and at one point she managed to change her hairstyle for a fight. She was clearly added for sex appeal for the fan boys but surprisingly didn't look as hot as usual.The end fight: the fight between Rourkes character and Ironman lasted about 30 seconds and without spoiling the film for people who haven't scene it had more than a predictable ending.Well worth a watch but it didn't have the wow factor of the original.",7,0,4,3 May 2010
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A Short Honest Review
","The film is entertaining in terms of action, visual effects, humour, and scenery etc. Where it becomes confusing is due to it's target market; it's too dark for really young children - I couldn't watch it with my 6 year old like the old Star Wars movies. Yet the story line is too predictable, simplistic, rushed, very lazy, and full of plot holes for adults to appreciate. It feels like a young teenager wrote it; I took my 10 year old son to watch it and he thought it was the best Star Wars yet.What Disney have effectively done is alienated the original Star Wars fans (not all, many think it's fantastic) but also made a Disney film that the whole family can't watch. In favour of picking up the Fortnite generation, fitting in marketing and merchandising opportunities.I personally thought it was the better of the latest trilogy and I certainly wasn't bored watching it, it has some really good moments, and some very nostalgic moments for fans to appreciate. Unfortunately a classic it is not and as a film on it's own I would say it's pretty forgettable.",7,3,6,24 December 2019
Gangs of New York," Good Start, Big Long Build Up, Pants Ending!
","This film starts with an awesome gang fight between the Irish Gangs and the American Gangs which instantly drawers you into the film. It then goes on to tell the story of the gangs, the history and politics of New York, in a very historically accurate and educational way! the plot is excellent and is everything you expect from a Scorsese film with a dramatic epic scale set.The downfall of this movie is the end, the film is very long but not boring, the plot builds up suspense right from the outset and gets you involved with the characters, you are led to believe that there is going to be a huge Gang fight (Irish VS American) at the end which i eagerly anticipated, but what happens?.........All the gangs march to the battle ground to fight (with an immense build up in atmosphere) in the midst of a city wide riot, get there, are just about to fight and then get individually killed by rioters, soldiers or cannon's from the American Navy.It left me feeling cheated and disappointed what type of film starts better than it ends and yet is still very long? If the ending had been good this film would have gone down as an all time classic, and i would have even been able to ignore the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio looks about as hard as a hamster with dysentery. But it wasn't so i couldn't!!! Unfortunately!",7,1,2,17 February 2006
