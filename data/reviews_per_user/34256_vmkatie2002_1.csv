The New World," Wished it was over before it even started
","I think this was the worst movie I've seen in a really long time. After 15 minutes I wanted it to be over, after about an hour I was wishing I could text message like the person next to me, just to relieve some of my overwhelming boredom. I think there was more talking in the last third of King Kong than in this whole movie. It was outrageous. The movie seriously could've been about an hour long if they cut out all the times when nothing was happening. I sat there thinking...well I'm glad these people can communicate so well! Along with the thoughts, about how disgusting it was for a 15yr old to be making out with all of these actors who are WAY older than her. There was only one scene in that movie that my friends and I liked, which is just SAD. I'm sure there are some who would like it, but those who are used to fast-paced, even medium-paced movies will probably be fighting the yawns like I.",1,1,7,15 April 2006
