10 Cloverfield Lane," The secrecy made everything better! (NO SPOILERS)
","First of all, if you want to watch '10 Cloverfield Lane', make sure to avoid any kind of spoilers on the internet. I will try to write this review without spoilers, even if it's a bit difficult considering the movie I just witnessed.'10 Cloverfield Lane' is an amazing mystery/suspense movie that serves as a sequel to the 2008 hit 'Cloverfield'. I have to say, it's hard to tell if the greatness of this movie is going to hold up in 10 years because of how everything surrounding the movie made it better, but I really really liked it.Me and my friend tried to avoid the spoilers on the internet and read as less as possible on the movie before we went to see it. Fortunately, the brilliant marketing campaign did not reveal anything about the story, and the fact that it was a sequel to 'Cloverfield' is going to make you constantly guess. Is it a traditional horror/suspense movie? Is it a monster movie? Where are the monsters? WHAT IS GOING? (Pretty much what I kept asking myself all along the movie)John Goodman was incredible, definitely the standout of this movie. The soundtrack was great, some jukebox oldies and a thrilling score.The movie starts with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) driving off from her marriage and taking the road to leave her husband. This is made with a perfect montage, and there's no dialogue for the first 4-5 minutes of the movie. Then, things take a turn and we are transported to the bunker you saw in the trailers.I will say it again, go watch this film, and don't read anything about it on the internet. I can't recall the last time a movie kept me guessing like this one. If you tend to get bored and tired by the usual clichés in movies, buy your ticket to '10 Cloverfield Lane' and enjoy your time at the movies.Clever marketing, brilliant story, very good direction, great performance by the cast, it's hard to complain about this film!9/10",9,130,212,15 March 2016
The Conjuring 2," Scary and Entertaining
","I am a big fan of 'The Conjuring' and I think it's the best horror movie of this decade so far. The expectations were high for the sequel with James Wan returning, but I also knew that the track record for horror sequels in general is not very good. As a horror movie, I think 'The Conjuring 2' succeeded at being entertaining and scary. The camera-work from James Wan is as good as it was in the first entry. The build up to the scary scenes is well-made and I love his establishing shots of the house. Something as banal as a chair can become scary in this movie. To me the best part of this movie was clearly James Wan's direction.In fact, there's a lot of good in this movie, but I was not a fan of the script. I know it's not necessarily fair to compare it to the first one, but we didn't get the big 'Annabelle' or the basement scares that we had in the first one. I also felt like the demon was not very threatening.To me the first 30-45 minutes were really scary and entertaining, at some point I was telling myself 'Well, this is almost on par with the first one', but things got a little bit out of hands in the last act. Without giving up spoilers, at some point in the film there's a new ghost entity that reveal itself. When you'll see the movie you will understand what I'm talking about. It took me a little bit out of the story, especially since they kept telling us it's based on a true story. But it was a cool ghost nevertheless.All things together, there are some great performances (I liked the little girl playing Janet) and spooky filmmaking by James Wan. It's not very fair to compare this with the first Conjuring, but if we compare it with other horror movies coming out these days, 'The Conjuring 2' prove itself to be a worthy sequel.8/10",8,14,28,11 June 2016
La La Land," Finally ending 2016 on the right note...
","Yes, 'La La Land' is a perfect movie and it's destined to be a classic in my opinion. I went to see it last night and I had to go back today because I kept thinking about it and humming the songs. This is a perfectly crafted film, I have only have positive things to say about 'La La Land', the movie I needed all year long. Just by watching the trailers I could smell something special with the amazing cinematography and the beautiful music. No need to say the movie exceeded my expectations. The casting of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is simply genius, I heard rumours that they initially had Miles Teller in mind for this movie, but it wouldn't have been the same without Gosling/Stone. This is the third movie with them together as the leads, with the underrated 'Crazy Stupid Love', and the disappointing 'Gangster Squad'. You can tell they were made for this musical, even though Ryan Gosling is not a natural born singer, the performance and the dance numbers wouldn't have been the same without their chemistry. Pretty sure Emma Stone is a lock for Best Actress.Obviously, the production design and the visuals are breathtaking, this is a movie I'm going to watch over and over again for the musical numbers. Most of the times it feels like you are watching a dream and I think this is exactly what Chazelle was aiming for, he succeeded at every level. The synergy between the music, the colours, the camera-work, the editing, the costumes and of course Gosling/Stone made this experience incredibly unique. There is also a lot of layers to 'La La Land', the story was essential to bring those numbers alive. Without spoiling anything, the ending was beautiful.I was not a fan of 'Les Misérables' and 'Chicago', but 'Singin in the Rain' and 'The Sound of Music' are the best musicals ever made. La La Land deserves a place among them, of course we will give the movie some time to breathe, but to me this already is a classic. There's so many things I have to say but I will let the smarter people talk about it. It's funny, engaging, beautiful, don't miss it!10/10",10,13,23,6 January 2017
"Hail, Caesar!"," 'Would that it were so simple...''
","Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a fixer working in Hollywood for Capitol Pictures. Set in the 50s, 'Hail Caesar!' goes behind the scenes the industry of cinema in a fashionable way.It's not a huge film, and if you're walking in expecting a movie like 'Fargo', 'No Country For Old Men' or 'Big Lebowski', you might be disappointed. There is not too much plot, but it's very very funny.I really love watching movies (maybe too much) and I am a big fan of the Coen Brothers. I was really looking forward to see this film without expecting too much. It's fair to say that 'Hail Caesar!' relies more on acting and style than story, but I'm not complaining. The cinematography by Roger Deakins was very well done, the script is funny and the acting is also on point.George Clooney's facial expression were priceless, and there was a lot of interesting supporting characters to lift this film. It's a typical Coen Brothers movie, the dialogue is well-written and very sharp, and the actors are delivering the lines perfectly.In my opinion, Alden Ehrenreich as Hobie Doyle really stole the show. The crowd in my theatre were laughing out loud every time he appeared on screen because you knew something funny was coming. I am looking forward to see more from this young actor, great find by the Coens.This is basically a satire of Hollywood and the 50s, you can expect jokes about religion... and Communists. In the end, I walked out of the theatre having a great time, and I'm probably going to see this film again. Being a fan of comedy, I have to say that I might be biased, but this was awesome! 8.5/10",9,11,24,5 February 2016
