Hereditary," A new instant classic for the horror genre, perfectly terrifying
","A peculiar and unsettling movie that seems almost Kubrick worthy thanks to its brilliant camera work, sets, special effects and its horrifying atmosphere that's keeps you on the end of your seat from start to finish. The One flaw of the movie would be its totally confusing plot that is almost impossible to describe, so much so that the only way to really understand what's going on is to read the story online after you walk out of the theater, but when your watching this movie, this is the last problem on everyone's mind. This is a brilliant, unique and spine chilling horror different from all of its predecessors, that'll leave you shocked for days.",8,7,12,31 July 2018
Call Me by Your Name," One of a kind masterpiece
","Everything in this film screams 'instant classic', from its incredible attention to every detail, the breath taking Italian scenery that, with the help of the director, makes you feel as if you were right there with the actors, the complicity and intreague of the characters that are so lovable and relatable that Makes le you feel as in love as they are; and finally the unique soundtrack that harmonizes perfectly with the film's paste and atmosphere. The director Luca guadagnino was able to immortalize Andre Aciman's powerful and compelling story so much as to feel yourself reeled in and part of it at the very first minute. This movie presents itself as the one of the only really Oscar worthy films and it really takes us back to the golden age of cinema when movies we call classics and masterpieces today were created. The only thing left to say is that the actors couldn't have been picked better and their stellar performances are really a big part of this movie.",9,3,6,30 July 2018
The Shape of Water," Interesting and unique
","This Oscar winning movie does a great job at depicting what looked like a crazy or impossible plot with wonderful scenery, special effects and a more than mediocre performance by its actors. The story is compelling and it makes you root for its characters as if you knew them in person and besides it's cliches and predictability, it never lets you down. In the end this is an intreaguing and fun movie although it dosnt stand out from the crowd and it dosnt leave you thinking about it for days and weeks, but it still does a good job at making an impossibly fictional premise into a plausible, calm and down to earth film.",7,4,7,30 July 2018
