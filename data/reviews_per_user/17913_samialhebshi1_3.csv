Deepwater Horizon," Good Director
","First, showing the possibilities of the director in the clarity and transfer of the real image of the recipient of the viewer and this genius was shown by the director Peter Berg was a tragedy as if we live ... I handed you. The camera moves in the explosion sites creating its visual effects body. I wanted to focus on the responses of the crew. The sound effects were creative when they were reduced, and reflected a situation where the viewer was present at the time of the explosion and reflected the state of temporary deafness. A story that shows real events We did not see any unreasonable additions in the scenario, which is considered to be the owner of the screenplay and director. 100%",7,1,2,13 July 2017
Lion," واقع
",True stories represent a difficult challenge for the director and screenwriter to convey the true image to the recipient in terms of environmental and acoustic influences and the embodiment of attitudes. I think the director was the best in taking the viewer to the poor Indian life and living the situation .... The child's 'Young Saroo' performance in the silence is unbelievably terrible ... and the image of Brother Guddu interferes in the events of the film timing 10/10. I think the choice of actress Nicole Kidman for this role is not good.,9,0,0,12 July 2017
Hidden Figures," Taraji P. Henson No.1 in 2016
",The actress Taraji P. Henson .. How I played the role of high professionalism I think it was worth the Oscars ... Or you are behind the camera wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful ... But ran with a high heel shoes is the story :) The film is wonderful in its use of the real story and I think that the scenario has achieved some positive and negative points in the introduction of some of the idea within the main axis of the film: - Racism at the time that the American community in some places still suffer (positive). - The focus of Catherine's (Taraji P. Henson) personal life was used in a way that caused the clarity of dramatic padding and the film's lack of practical positions (negative). - How very wonderful a shot of a gift to Mary Jackson of her husband may be in the simplest things deepest meanings. - Magnificence of directing for the fifties and sixties (positive). - The director's failure to introduce a sense of the viewer to the surroundings of NASA because of the lack of scenes of the Agency's facilities caused the weakness of the strength of the viewer (negative). I think the actress Taraji P. Henson is the one who added the film and not the opposite star 2016 ... 100% Director: 85% Scenario: 80%,6,0,2,16 July 2017
