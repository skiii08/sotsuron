Casablanca," The best thing about Casablanca **SPOILERS**
","To me, the best thing about Casablanca is that every character (except for Strasser) ends up doing what is best for the others. Every character makes a sacrifice so that the others are better off.<ul><li>Renault does the right thing for Rick, even though Renault will have to give up his comfortable position.</li></ul><ul><li>Ferrari does the right thing for Victor and Ilsa, although there is nothing in it for himself.</li></ul><ul><li>Victor is willing to give up Ilsa to his rival in order to insure her safety.</li></ul><ul><li>Rick does the right thing for Victor (and the larger cause), even though it means giving up Ilsa.</li></ul><ul><li>Ilsa also does the right thing for Victor, but she loses Rick because of it.</li></ul>In fact, the Rick-Ilsa-Victor storyline is the most mature representation of a love triangle I have ever seen on film. Even though it is clear that the Rick-Ilsa relationship is the more passionate, it is impossible to cheer for her to leave Victor. When Victor goes to Rick's and pleads with Rick to use the letters of transit for Rick and Ilsa to escape, even Rick sees that Victor is not just a hero or an iconic symbol - he is truly a good person.",10,2,3,14 March 2009
