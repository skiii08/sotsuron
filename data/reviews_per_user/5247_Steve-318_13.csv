Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Hype springs eternal nonsense as the sequel lacks the force.
","First of all, I didn't mind Jar Jar.  If anything, he brought a little humor to the otherwise stiff proceedings.  Like so many Bond remakes, this comes at you with almost too much boom and zoom.  I sure didn't like the kid whose acting abilities peaked with the pod race scene and went into a nose dive after that.  And why couldn't Mr. Jedi Knight bring the mother?  That bothered me!  But not as much as the total lack of cohesion in the story. Needless to say, good special effects kept things entertaining but, considering all the advance publicity, this one sagged.",Null,0,1,20 November 1999
The Fifth Element," Sci-fi that rocks--even without George Lucas.
",Bruce Willis powers through a film that's part comedy and all fantasy. Surprise--it works.  Would have to rate among the top 10 sci-fi films of the 90's--not that the designation means a whole lot.  The good thing about this movie is that it allows for a sense of humor/humanity in the future instead of the cartoon cutouts we've been spoon-fed in the Star Wars series.,8,0,1,23 February 2001
The Thing," Overly dark remake of classic 1951 sci-fi thriller
","We know that John Carpenter revers the original 'Thing,' directed by Howard Hawks back in 1951.  For one thing, he's said so but it's also playing on the TV the kids are watching in Carpenter's original 'Halloween.'  Too bad Carpenter was unduly influenced by Ridley Scott's 'Alien' because this film's tone comes off a shade heavier than the atmosphere on Jupiter.A good cast is generally wasted in a treatment spoiled by Carpenter's penchant for excessive violence.  Maybe we've got a creature with mind-numbing power and a real threat to the human race but there's no dramatic build-up, no interplay between characters, absolutely no humor--in other words, a good time is had by none.Would have liked to have seen a story unfold like the original instead of the steady series of blows to the gut that Carpenter delivers.  He had all the pieces here--U.S. Antarctic post finds Norwegian camp destroyed near their discovery of a spaceship in the ice.  Thing terrorizes US camp.  But, whoa, we go into horror overdrive and everything goes downhill.  Should do it again and get it right.",4,12,45,23 December 2000
"I, Robot"," Will Smith to the rescue
","The robots are a revelation--insect-like, fast-moving and believable. But the Will Smith role is strictly from comicsville. It's not that Smith is all that bad an actor. He plays the usual Will Smith part--kind of a cross between Eddie Murphy and Audie Murphy. His part is written as if Smith had the script in his back pocket while everyone else walks blindly around robot town.All this flick needed was a little mystery--just a little but that ain't the way it goes. Oh, Smith rumbles around with a young lady looking for clues but it's weak.The one thing you know--you can bank on--the message is the same from Frankenstein to 2001 to Westworld to Jurassic Park to I, Robot--technology as grand as it may be will always turn on us humans.Since we know that, what's this story about, you ask? Won't tell you.Just know that there are good special effects and little to no suspense. At some point, Hollywood may want to really consider if all the effects aren't harming movies in the long run. You can make all these amazing things crash and burn and it's all very believable. Trouble is--it's covering up a weak story.",6,1,2,22 December 2004
Kelly's Heroes," Part war movie, part comedy, part classic
","Not your average war movie. Fascinating cast includes Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, Don Rickles and Carroll O'Connor. It's a shoot 'em up war film on one hand with Germans mowed down like the morning grass but it's also a heist picture. This movie is certainly a a product of its time with a showdown scene reminiscent of Eastwood's spaghetti western past. Sutherland plays the spaced-out tank jockey with a 60's flavor that's fun to watch. Savalas may be the toughest sarge on film and that's saying a lot. This film probably could have been a classic without much trouble. The pieces are all there. The ending needs work. But enjoy what we have which is plenty.",8,2,4,15 May 2004
The Mummy Returns," Action, special effects, nonsense.
","Mindless rubbish--that's how another IMBD reader referred to this sequel--and that's pretty accurate.  The fact that it was one of Hollywood's designated 'big' movies for 2001, grossing over $200 million, is not surprising.  After all the Brendan Fraser heroics worked well in the first 'Mummy' picture, only slightly less ridiculous than this one.What you've got here appears to be the successor to the 'Indiana Jones' series of constant cliffhangers, live-action cartoons that chew up characters with abandon.  While extras die like flies, the audience apparently doesn't care that every bullet, sword and scimitar leveled at our heroes (a total of six people in this one) is guaranteed to miss and that every unbelievable scene is one-upped by the one following it. When one of those blades actually finds its mark and a major character dies --not to worry--the death doesn't take and she comes back.  Surprise!The sequel trades on the fact that we're already familiar with the Mummy, who's come a long way since his shuffling Boris Karloff days.  This Imenhotep is a savage superfiend, part Spiderman and part Freddie Krueger, apparently with only one weakness--he just can't snuff out Fraser or any of the other members of his cinematic family.  And, oh yes, there's a kid in this one who exudes as much charm as the insufferable brat brought to 'Star Wars--Phantom.' But this seems directly aimed at the younger set and has video game written all over it.  You've got some mini-mummies who come flying out of the tall grass a la the 'jurassic' raptors and a scorpion king with the head of a Rock.Without Fraser's breezy style, the whole thing would collapse but the producers don't appear too concerned with dramatic license.  There's nothing unusual about Hollywood heroes overcoming ridiculous odds but whether it's James Bond, Arnold or Jackie Chan, the secret for success is to concoct a plot that allows for the suspension of reality.Yet the 'Mummy' team just piles up the special effects and trots off laughing--all the way to the bank.I gave this thing a '3' only because it might do something to encourage further study of ancient Egypt.",3,0,1,17 March 2002
Toy Story 2," Triumphant return to the toy box.
","Animated masterpiece that continues two of Hollywood's classic characters: Sheriff Woody and Buzz Lightyear voiced by Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, respectively.  This time we find out that Sheriff Woody has some history, a delightful look back on the western craze of the 50's.  Plenty of one-liners in this fast-paced romp.",9,0,1,27 December 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Potter comes to Hollywood, I say!
","The most celebrated fantasy book of our time has come to the screen but maybe you were  already aware of that.I liked the movie but then I don't think it would have been posible not to like a film based on Rowling's brilliant story.  The characters leapt from the page right from the start--like the portraits and photos in the wizard world, they were already moving in our minds.Don't read further if you haven't seen the movie or plan to and don't want to hear specific movie criticism before you go...I love all the wizardy atmosphere that was a fun part of the series and right up the special-effects-minded Hollywood alley but the film's continuity lapsed somewhere during the trio's search for the sorcerer's stone until Harry's climactic duel with Voldemort.You can almost hear the pages rustling.  The three go here and there--not because they really are on to something that the theater audience can follow but because that's the way it goes in the book.  If that continues in the sequel, look for Pottermania to drop off big-time at the box office.You still need to craft a story for the screen and, as good as Rowling's books are, you can't use everything she puts in or the movie would last for hours and hours (some say this one does already).  So...somebody's got to undertake the job of reworking wizardry for the big screen, not just regurgitating a best-selling book.Here's a vote to favor the freewheeling humor that makes Harry a hit with young and old alike.  The Star Wars canteena scenes (gruesome faces and the like) can be thrown in for effect, of course, but don't plan the whole bloody movie around them.The quidditch game, for example, reminded me of the sequence in the last 'Star Wars' movie when the kid won the rocket race.  It's all effects without much concern for genuine drama.  Harry needed to have practiced or something for us to believe that the little blighter was the real deal up there on his broom.  Otherwise, it's just a cartoon and he's supposed to win.You can come back now if you've been ignoring all this because you don't fancy some ninny spoiling it for you...There's a lot of good stuff in 'Harry Potter'--the movie.  Some nice acting--particularly Snape, the custodian (with his red-eyed cat) and Hagrid.  Richard Harris and Maggie Smith are both wonderful.  The kids are good, too--when they can tear loose of the director's reliance on going by the book.Conclusion: book, A; movie, B--and you could do a whole lot worse than that.",Null,0,0,24 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Finally in a video store far, far away: an end in sight to the excessive space saga
","An IMDb rating of 8? Please! As the grand finale of the most popular movie series of all time, there's a tendency to be sentimental but let's be cinematically honest--this is a piece of crap. Oh, there are the special effects and the wondrous images, There's Christopher Lee, still vibrant and menacing in his 80s, able to claim the honor of starring in both 'Star Wars' and 'Lord of the Rings' sagas. There's that Shakespeare in space feel to some of it that producer/writer/director George Lucas might have been going for but with one huge deficiency--there's no story other than to grind along to the inevitable set-up for that first Star Wars film (may the power of the fourth be with you). Not only is the Sith film nothing more than a disjointed collection of scenes preceded by space ships sweeping into orbit or landing on some nifty space station but the dialog is wooden and hollow. With every line, there's a flashing light going off blaring, 'Acting, acting.' How can you have a successful sci-fi film without suspending reality? Jar Jar Binks might have been a real pick-me-up in this one but all who fall under the Lucas script are lost. Natalie Portman is a wonderful actress but you'd never know it from her Padme role. She's reduced to some the most insipid exchanges on film. Haydyn Christensen (Annikin), on the other hand, may be the worst actor this side of Tatooine. He summons up about as much feeling in his conversion to the dark side as Jerry Mathers might have if they'd ever made Beaver go evil. 'Evil Beaver' might actually have been a more interesting movie. ('Wally, I don't know know what's happening to me!' 'Gee, Beaver, you got dark circles under your eyes. You just stabbed Dad. Mom's gonna not going to like this.') One could go on and on citing the deficiencies of latest piece of Star Wars slop but it's really not necessary. If you're so entranced with the series and the technical accomplishments, you probably don't care about things like plot or direction. I actually liked the earlier Star Wars films. They were special effects masterpieces that managed to have some lighthearted and human qualities. But try as he might--despite reaping millions in receipts and promotional knickknacks--Lucas can't do it anymore. It just may be that he's caught up in his own formula. Ewan McGregor riding around on the lizard--please! It's just so contrived (there's no truth to the rumor that a sequel--Return of the Lizard--is in the works) The last three Star Wars films failed and this one completely. Thank God it's over. Now go back and watch Mark Hammill and the gang and have some fun.",5,1,4,12 November 2005
Shrek," Animated fairy tale offers modern touches.
","Although falling short of the majesty of 'Toy Story,' Shrek' does an admirable job in the animated family entertainment department.  A likeable ogre, a talking donkey and a host of other familiar fairy-tale characters populate the screen in a semi-charming story that serves up both humor and pathos.  Jabs at Disneyland and a very funny send-up of Robin Hood and his merry men are among the film highlights.  I especially liked Eddie Murphy (the donkey) and his rendition of the old Monkees' hit, 'I'm a Believer,' (at movie's end).  If you wonder how many people it takes to make a film like Shrek, sit through the credits.  You'll go through four complete songs before the names stop rolling.",8,0,0,2 June 2001
Tombstone," Lots of flash but you can bury this one
","'Tombstone' is one of those stylized movies that has a lot of good qualities--some fine players, nice camerawork and a couple of tense scenes. But, overall, it's a mess. Nothing hangs together. It's really just a series of scenes strung together and called a movie. Kurt Russell, no stranger to action hero roles, is Wyatt Earp but you never get inside this guy. We start off with a sense of family with Wyatt and his brothers but nothing develops. We just have scenes. Hugh O'Brian may have provided a clearer characterization on the old TV show. But Val Kilmer is good, playing the sharp-witted, weak-lunged Bat Masterson. The whole thing starts off like a documentary with Robert Mitchum intoning something about the old west while some silent picture is shown. It might as well have been the one of 'Beef--it's what's for dinner' spots. I don't know who this director is but he was obviously trying unsuccessfully to recreate the spaghetti westerns of the 1960's. The violence is layered in like a cake. I think there must be a UCLA film course out there that might talk about the need for subtlety when trying to establish a sinister characterization. Otherwise, it's just another shooting gallery. If there isn't there should be.  This film is good for a couple of clips but it needs to be buried on Boot Hill otherwise.",5,11,19,10 January 2004
The Great Escape," Escapist entertainment
","I'm a little surprised ar how highly this movie is rated by IMBD fans. It's a decent movie with a lot of stars but a lot of it reminds me of 'Hogan's Heroes' without the laugh track. Characters played by Steve McQueen and James Garner act more like they're in summer camp instead of a German prison camp. Ohhh, big penalty--put him in the cooler (a little prison cell where McQueen plays handball) for trying to escape. 'Stalag 17' was not only a more convincing POW film but it had a more satisfying ending.",6,3,11,22 November 2003
Saboteur," WWII Hitchcock sheds light on master's tendencies
","You can't help but marvel at Hitchcock's early work. 'Saboteur,' for example, is so slick and quick that it's hard to believe he made this film over 60 years ago. There's some propaganda elements but they're woven into the mystery so well that the thing plays beautifully years later. You also get some previews of stuff that Hitchcock would do later--like using a national landmark as a backdrop. This time it's the Statue of Liberty. In 'North by Northwest,' of course, it's Mt. Rushmore. You'll also recognize things that pop up later in 'Rear Window' and 'Vertigo' in 'Saboteur' but let's not give away the show. Robert Cummings is excellent as is the oh-so-charming Otto Kruger. Look for Hitchcock's mini-western in this one. It happens quickly so don't blink.",8,31,41,12 February 2004
