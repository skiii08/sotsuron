Black Swan," Beautiful, touching and mind-blowing
","This piece presents us a nude and raw vision of human beings obsessions, bringing a study that comes to scare us at night. Aronofsky's films usually prevent us from sleeping and this one don't walk away from this reality. 
Lead by strong and confident performances - especially from Natalie Portman - the movie portraits the image of a woman thread by her own talent and find herself trapped into a hunting for perfection. The editing make easy to believe that she's going insane at the same time that the audience have no idea of what's going on. That brings us to the higher point of the movie, the directing. Full of imaginative chops and claustrophobic close-ups on Portman's face, making who's watching to feel her agony and despair. 
Even full of traumatizing moments, the film never forget to be sexy and provocative, evoking the audience to it biggest tension, especially at the final dance presentations which shows the ultimate directing skills of Aronofsky - well-deserved Oscar nomination - and take off our breathing. 
A masterpiece from beginning to end, and definitivally a must-see movie. Go watch and lose your mind.",10,1,1,14 January 2018
Spirited Away," Spirited Away
","A masterpiece from beginning to end. I watched the movie a few years ago, but only now did I have time to stop writing my review of it.With a hypnotic script and captivating and deep characters, he builds a pure and true narrative, with the details that one does not expect a typical photograph of the Ghibli Studios, that leave you hypnotized and stunned. Chihiro is a brave and strong girl, who does not give up trying to regain her parents at any moment, and goes through harrowing adversities and leaves you jumping from the chair in fervor, while blindly twisting for her.All supporting characters have their context line and this gives richness to the long, outgoing Hollywood standards of digital animations and very polished. There is representatives here. We have no masked elements, everything here is very visible and explicit, greed, selfishness, egocentricity and even envy. All very well placed and accessible to anyone who wants to see. From the owner of the spa to the toad that takes care of the aromatic tablets. Anyway, Spirited Away's journey is abstract, sensitive and profound. It contains a unique and playful universe that holds attention and eyes until the last scene. A must-see movie.",10,0,1,20 March 2017
