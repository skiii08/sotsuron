The Avengers," A fantastic movie!
","I'm one of those fans that was extremely hyped up about the possibility of an actual 'Avengers' movie coming to the big screens. However, when production started, I was terrified. It seemed to go by so quick, and I was afraid that giving this huge and potentially epic movie to Whedon could've back fired. I mean I know that he was up and coming, and this his previous work was good, but for something of this magnitude? I was fearful. All I have to say is thank you for giving Whedon the vote of confidence. He absolutely nailed this movie. It was not only a home-run, in my eyes, it was a grand slam. He was able to bring all of these different personalities (on/off screen) and make it work. The story line was solid. The vision for this movie was vast, and Whedon, along with the writers, producers, and FX crew, exceeded expectations. This movie blew me away! It had a great pace to it, and the actors delivered.My only critique would be, 'Captain America'. To be honest, I was never really sold on Chris Evans. He did a decent job in the solo movie, but I don't know, he's just not Captain America to me. It seemed like he followed orders more than taking control of the team, with the exception of that sequence towards the end. I understand that this is all a build up for another Cap Movie, and ultimately, Avengers 2. I think that it's just Chris Evans. He doesn't demand that 'On-Screen' presence that you'd figure Captain America to have.Aside from that, this movie was absolutely excellent. Great story. Awesome acting (especially from the Loki character). Amazing action. Unbelievable FX. And 'they have a Hulk!' how could you beat that. 9.5 out of 10 in my book. And all's I got to say is, Avatar....watch out. The Avengers are coming for the record books.",10,3,8,8 May 2012
