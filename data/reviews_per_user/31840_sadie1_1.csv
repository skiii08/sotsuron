Marie Antoinette," Sometimes beautiful but BORING!
","Sometimes beautiful,but historically unfullfilling and BORING! I'm supposed to write 10 lines, but there isn't enough to write 10 lines about. We couldn't wait for this movie to be over...however we did rush home to research Marie to flesh out the many voids left by the movie. What happened to her kids? Where was the French army? Etc. Character development was minimal and the pace was agonizing...perhaps to make you feel the same way she did, but never the less. I selected this movie and had to make it up to my husband by agreeing to go see a war movie with him. A movie need to be more than visually appealing. And even that wasn't a given. There were moments of very annoying jumpy, hand held camera work. I'm done with you Sophia Coppola.",2,13,25,23 October 2006
