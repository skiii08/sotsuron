Antz," I love where technology is taking animation.
","Antz is a thoroughly enjoyable film. Animation technology just keeps getting better, so much so that film makers can forget that it's still the means of telling the story, not the end in itself. Antz avoids this trap with fully developed characters and a plausible plotThe casting was inspired, notably Hackman, Walken, and Stalone. Little details made the film fun --the 'line dancing' in the bar, the princess stuck in the gum on the sneaker.I enjoyed 'Antz'. When can we look forward to a sequel? 'Roachez'?",8,0,0,5 June 1999
