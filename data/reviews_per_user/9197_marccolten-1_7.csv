Blade Runner 2049," Wow, what an awful film
","First, I could not understand a single word anyone said and had to use CC the whole time. The final credits were dim grey on black, so I could not read one word. Between those problems the film made no sense at all.So Rachel had a baby and the rebellion leader said if the can have children they're in charge of their own destiny? Tell that to HUMAN slaves. So that was stupid.Who was Jared Leto? Why did he want the baby? In fact who was anyone? No one made any sense as to who they were, what they wanted or what their goals were. Why did the assassin kills the blond lady? It's just too much to go into. It was slow, dull, incomprehensible and was of time. Mine and who ever made this movie.",1,6,10,5 July 2018
Watchmen," Really bad, confusing and empty
","I find the credit sequence is the only good part of the movie, and even that is awful. Who are these people dressed as superheroes found dead in doorways or hauled off to asylums? They appear able to leap out of planes and land unharmed, pick up other people to toss them around and punch through brick walls, but have no origin stories, except for Doctor Manhattan. His origin story apparently takes place in an alternate-alternate-timeline where humanity never invented the circuit breaker. He's trapped in an atomic machine with no off switch? Nothing about this movie makes any sense and the characters are not interesting at all.",1,4,8,5 December 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Really Terrible Movie
","The really stupid part of the movie was that killing Trask makes things worse, but terrorizing the president and the military in full view of the world doesn't. So one mutant saved the president and Trask is defeated and is arrested for selling military secrets? What secrets do they have that he doesn't? His technology is 100 years ahead of the rest of the world (giant autonomous flying robots in 1973?). After what Magneto did they would kill every mutant and abort every fetus that could possibly be one.If Mystique has her powers then and can even mimic Trask and break into his office why fly to Paris for a public assassination? Drown him in his bathtub - no guards, no air travel.Better plan - if Magneto can command the 1973 Sentinels (never explained) have them suddenly go berserk at the demonstration like ED in Robocop and start killing everybody without an obvious mutant in charge. THEN Trask goes to prison and no one ever builds a Sentinel again.",3,1,3,12 April 2015
Children of Men," Very dumb movie
","Okay - I know many people seem to love this film but I was dumbfounded from start to finish. Well before the start - the entire concept as reported in ads, reviews and discussions on TV confused me.***************** SPOILERS *************************************1) The premise that all women everywhere (but not animals apparently) can't have babies - fine - as David Letterman said 'If you buy the premise you buy the bit'.2) That this leads to fascism and terrorism - sorry makes no sense. I would expect depression and malaise but not violence. For example, if you look at the real world you would see that it's having children that causes problems. When people have children and see that they will never get homes, jobs, education or health care, you get violence. In COM who is committing the violence, people who want to get pregnant but can't? There was a scene where Theo is on a bus and young men are throwing rocks. All I could think of was 'Shouldn't they be out trying to get women pregnant?'. Any government would pay a million dollars for a baby, any baby.3) Okay, so a woman is pregnant (again with the Christian allegory) who is somehow the savior of humanity. Fine, but why this leads to a chase and killings makes no sense. Who are the 'they' who the woman has to be protected from? Although it was nice for the bad guys to occasionally pause to provide exposition and back story where Theo can hear it. And why is taking her out in a rowboat to find people who might not exist the answer? You're telling me that every lab in the world isn't working on this problem? Any 1st world nation from nearby France and Germany to the distant US and Canada would be glad to send anything that was needed to get her and find out the answer.4) I get the reference to today and Homeland Security, but this is the one situation where attacking refugees would not be the answer. With no one under 20 in your country you'd be importing them, as slaves if nothing else. It's not like today where the anti-immigration people are terrified of being over-birthed out of power. They're drones, just like you, so why bother5) The one real situation was after the birth, where all the people in the internment camp are crying and reaching out to touch the baby. Then the soldiers. Do they shoot? No, they put down their guns, some kneel and cross themselves. WHO ARE THEY RUNNING FROM? The kid has it's own army! They'd desert and march the kid anywhere, to a lab.6) The end credits has the sounds of laughing children suggesting the problem has been solved. I hope they are not suggesting that one woman and her daughter will repopulate the Earth - not much of a breeding population to work with. So some organization (with a boat named 'Tomorrow' - jeez) will solve the problem because (unlike 'The Human Project') everyone else wants the human race to go extinct.Sorry, just an absurd and stupid movie.",1,27,47,18 October 2007
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Loud and stupid
","Yes, I saw the previous movies, so I know who the Avengers are but I frankly didn't understand a moment of this movie from beginning to end. Good guys are bad guys, bad guys become good guys. They kept introducing new characters and magical technologies straight through the movie. Also, I don't think you are a hero when you solve a problem you created through your own stupidity. Fortunately, despite all the shooting, explosions, fire, radiation and killer robots not one innocent person so much as got a nosebleed. I mean they evacuated an entire flying city? Good work, writers, not a single drop of blood on the Avengers' hands.",1,11,28,24 January 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," Stupid sci-fi
","When I heard the title I thought it was a daytime soap opera, but that's hardly the point.The first problem is that they treat the 'time reset' as an advantage when it is not. Imagine D-Day. Years of planning, hundreds of soldiers killed but the objective is achieved and an Allied foothold is taken. Then, just as the day ends, a single soldier is killed. He steps on a mine or is shot by a sniper and suddenly it's yesterday and they have to do it all over again. Maybe it will go better or maybe it will be a disaster. The point is they do not control it, not with Alphas roaming loose. They also have to know that the power can be transferred to a human, giving them the advantage.The real stupidity is in the writing. For example, despite being the only one with the power, Cruise manages to convince a platoon to follow him. So, the night before the battle (a battle that Cruise knows is a trap) they sit around talking about how they are going to get off that beach alive. But if Cruise knows it is a trap why are they going there at all? Why walk into a trap? In fact, why are they waiting at all? They've got a 12 hour head start. Why wait to step into a trap to desert? Why not start now and be halfway to the Omega before the battle starts?Another example is the helicopter. He knows they fail every time so why keep trying? Isn't the textbook definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result? I he knows it's a trap, why not swing a few miles north or a few miles east and try that? Why do the same thing over and over? It's just stupid.Of course, the whole ending is absurd. They kill the Omega and it's the day before, when the Omega is still alive. Everyone who died is alive and the aliens are defeated and no one knows why or how.",2,2,9,24 December 2018
Looper," Terrible from the get go
","I'll confess to being very judgmental about films and TV shows. If, in the first minutes, you see that the entire premise is absurd, I'm against the whole thing. From the minute you are told that people in the future send their contracts back 40 years to be killed by over-paid people who themselves are later killed, by themselves - the entire movie goes off the rails. Once you ask yourself why they don't send them back 10,000 years, or to the middle of the ocean - you're done.All the rest, the TK, the Terminator rip-off, the 'One' rip-off of The Matrix and others - well, it's just crap piled on crap. The time travel concepts are ridiculous. Okay, so a guy is sent back and then his current self is mutilated, which appear instantly on the older guy. So how did he spend all those years without his limbs to be sent back intact? No, I call no way. Same with the ending. So young Joe kills himself, which erases old Joe from the time line. So all the criminals he killed and the loopers are okay now? How is the kid still wounded?Just really lousy.",2,1,3,13 July 2013
