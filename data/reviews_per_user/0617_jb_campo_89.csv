The King's Speech," Superb historical story and film
","The King's Speech is an all around outstanding film. Excellent casting, incredible acting, a terrific story, and the real world actually hanging in the balance.Geoffrey Rush is terrific as Mr Logue, a gifted, driven speech pathologist who works to help people regain the ability to talk without stuttering. Bertie, aka the to-be King George VIth, is played by Colin Firth. It was impressive to see Helena Bonham Carter as Her Majesty because you've seen her play some wildly opposite characters in various films. These three actors are the core stars in this film, and they all give great performances.Bertie is filled with self doubt because of his inability to speak in public without stuttering. He tries every remedy, but nothing works. He had two brothers, one who died earlier in life, and the older brother who really does not want to be King. Events happen that lead to Bertie being pressed into duty. While he knows he can do it, he doubts he can do the speaking part of it. A friendship develops between Mr Logue and Bertie, as each tries to find the right balance of power between a commoner, and a royal King, while they try to be equals with a job to do and a nation at stake.The nation is at stake due to Hitler's assault on Europe. Bertie knows that the UK needs to stand up and be counted, but he continually fears his inability to speak makes him weak, especially compared to Hitler's loud, forceful, moving oratory style.The King's Speech elicits all your emotions - happy, sad, fearful, hopeful, scared, laughing - and isn't that why you go to the movies? See this movie - it's one of the greats. Enjoy.",9,0,0,7 May 2017
First Man," Terrific, realistic, eye-opening biographical
","First Man tells the inside story about the astronauts from the 1960s who were battling to defeat the Russians in the race to space. The focus is on Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling - LaLa Land), the first man to walk on the moon. Along the way you learn about his wife (Claire Foy - Girl in the Spiders Web) and their complex, strained marriage. Most revealing are all the details you learn about his family and the stress and strain they faced.Gosling delivers a stellar performance as Armstrong, who is revealed as a quiet, humble, gracious man. He carries the weight of multiple tragedies on his shoulders. You learn that he's lost family, and friends, but somehow, space calls to him. He is revealed as a try pioneer who wants to go where no one has gone before. And this guy was REAL, not like Matt Damon in Martian. Which makes his story even more compelling.The director does a terrific job of weaving in key incidents that led to decisions that caused things to happened that affected the entire Gemini and Apollo program. Finally, the focus was definitely on the first step on the moon, but also the journey to get there.This film delivers real lifelike feelings throughout. These space ships were using computers that nowadays are antiques. You feel the ships shaking, You hear the groans and creaks of metal being stressed. You hear buzzers going off with warnings. You are there. If you watch the Special Features, you learn that the film is very realistic because instead of a green screen, they used a new, huge LED screen with images of the moon. This gave the actors and stage people the ability to see their surroundings and deliver a more real experience. It works!!! I really hope this LED technology advances movies to become more realistic, which benefits everyone.Great acting by Claire Foy as Mrs Armstrong. She delivers the perfect portrayal of a 1960s wife of an astronaut who at any time could lose her husband. Other excellent supporting cast roles too. The landing reveals something that I did not know, and you will be surprised too. It reveals how much Armstrong loved his family, and how he felt about a greater power. Gosling should have been at least nominated for Best Actor - again - he was terrific.First Man is an excellent film that stands right up there with The Right Stuff and Apollo 13 as superior space films. See it - you'll love it. Enjoy",8,0,2,27 April 2019
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Boring - skip this one
","If you expect to see anything happen in this movie, you will be very disappointed. I think that Katniss didn't have one fight or even fire one arrow in this entire movie. Katniss wakes up, and stuff had happened to her. She learns of destruction. She sees destruction. She comes to be the MockingJay, which we already knew like 2 movies ago.There was zero drama, zero action, and it looked like poor Katniss was sedated for 90 % of the film.No, don't waste your time. Skip this, go to Part 2, and you won't have missed a beat.",5,0,0,2 July 2016
The Monuments Men," liked it enough
","Monuments Men is the kind of movie you remember a bit, then forget, but could have been better. Cate Blanchet was great as a French loyalist art curator. She meets Matt Damon, not a very believable role as an art expert. George Clooney leads the gang of old fart art guys brought into the WW2 to save art being stolen by the Nazis. The director played up the cuteness of these guys, while trying to instill some seriousness, like getting shot at, or even death. There was a little tension built up at the end, but don't expect much of that. The guys like Goodman and Murray played well. You end up respecting how much the real monument men really did to save the world's art treasures. I was thinking 6, or 7 out of 10. But I think because of Blanchet, and some strong bit acting by German characters, it is a film that you would like despite some miscasting, and not enough time spent on the talents of Goodman and Murray. Enjoy.",7,0,0,12 October 2014
Mission: Impossible III," Fast-paced action thriller
","If you are craving a non-stop action movie with a decent plot and acting, go no further than MI-3. Tom Cruise reprises the role of Ethan Hunt, IMF agent extraordinaire who is attempting to leave the IMF field work to others as he takes over training of new agents. Can he stand it? Of course not! or the movie would've ended in 10 minutes!He's engaged to marry Michelle Monaghan as his fianc√©e Julia. I think their chemistry was pretty good. I recently watched her in Source Code and she's a terrific actress. At an engagement party, Ethan gets a call and next thing you know, he's back in the field. He just has that itch and needs to scratch it. Cruise does a decent acting job of a guy torn between two worlds, where he wants to be just another normal guy, but his whole team is telling him that he can't have a normal life. His team delivers, particularly Ving Rhames, who is so Mr. Cool. Also Maggie Q has a unique ability to blend in as nobody special, but be made to be very sexy when needed. Jonathan Rhyss Myers was standard. I saw him in Bend it Like Beckham, and he's OK as an actor. Laurence Fishburne delivers as a mega boss type guy who takes no crap or bs from anyone. And finally Billy Crudup as Cruise's mission chief who aids and abets Cruise outside the authority of officialdom. The plot is pretty simple, good guys against bad guys. Phillipe S. Hoffman absolutely delivers as evil, sadistic, feelingless arms dealer Owen Davian, who sells anything to anyone for a price with no concern about anyone. Hoffman, RIP, has some tremendous scenes with Cruise, where they go toe to toe in life or death struggles. Whoa, those scenes are really intense emotionally and physically.The action spans the globe from the US to Germany to Italy to China and back. At a little over 2 hours, the film is nicely paced. There are no real down moments where you feel the movie drags - it's non-stop. At the end, you don't really care about the Rabbit's Foot as much as you do about how it's going to go down. Just strap yourself in and enjoy this fine installment to the MI series. Enjoy.",7,21,26,28 July 2014
Captain Phillips," Solid film in all aspects
","I keep wanting to rate Captain Phillips as 8, but keep coming back to 7. It is a solid film, with a few minor items holding it down. I remember this event, but didn't follow the details of how the capture went down, how the escape took place, and how it all played out in the end. Knowing that Phillips lives to write this story takes a little drama out, but not too much.Because the acting is inspiring. Tom Hanks is terrific, especially in the 2nd half of the film where you see him disintegrate before your eyes as his situation falls apart. You really feel his hope fade as drug- crazed pirates start to realize the same disintegration is happening to their hopes. The clash of desperation from both sides is what makes this a superior thriller, again, especially in the 2nd half.The actor playing Muse was terrific, as was his band of pirates. Hard to believe he was like a taxi driver taken off the streets to play this character - he was terrific. The cinematography was outstanding, with breathtaking vistas of Somalian beaches, wide open oceans, and a huge tanker. The Director does a great job of getting the story accurate, and keeping it taut, though, the final chase scenes took a little longer than you'd like. Again, if this was done for accuracy and completeness, it's understandable. All told, this one is worth your while. The last five minutes will have you climbing the walls, guaranteed. Climb aboard!

10 Cloverfield Lane," Good Combo Horror/Sci Fi Thriller
","Is this a horror movie? Is it a sci-fi movie, or a thrilling combo of both genres. You be the judge. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) decides to end her relationship with her boyfriend and drives off to who knows where. She's driving when something happens and her car goes off the road. Is she dead? she wakes up to find herself in the company of Howard, a wacko survivalist. I loved John Goodman in this role. Boy, he delivers. You learn there is another guy voluntarily in there, Emmett (John Gallagher Jr). Let the games begin.Howard says that something happened, and they need to stay underground for 1-2 years till the air is cleared. Is he lying? He's obviously crazy and controlling. Some of the stories he weaves just don't seem to ring true. But Emmett concurs that something happened.The story weaves itself wonderfully around a cat and mouse game between Howard and his guests. Are they acclimating to the new world, or plotting to overthrow him? What is really happening outside.I can't say more, without revealing too much info. The director does a fine job of pulling this together, but biggest kudos go to the Casting director because the chemistry between the 3 main stars is just dead on fantastic. I recommend seeking out more movies with Ms Winstead, who did an excellent job portraying a fighting woman with a lot of guts.In the end, you may find yourself thinking of various movies, which makes this a unique new type film that I think will inspire similar types based off existing themes. Strap yourself in and take a trip to 10 Cloverfield Lane. Enjoy.",7,1,2,2 July 2016
The Finest Hours," Fine work all around
","The Finest Hours depicts the true story of what is called the greatest US Coast Guard rescue in history. In 1952, Chris Pine, a junior officer, and his small team of men, get dispatched into a raging storm to attempt to rescue survivors from a horrific accident that ripped an oil tanker in half. Pine apparently had failed in a previous rescue attempt, and in the small New England city town, this stain stayed with him forever. But his young bride-to-be brings an out of town attitude that kicks people in the butt, getting them to move, when she sees her spouse's life endangered. There is just enough of that plot to have you rooting for the young couple, but not too much to sap the main story.Casey Affleck delivers from the other side, as the chief engineer on the ship that is going down. The ideas he devises to gain time and give the crew their only chance for survival are incredible. The special effects of the powerful storm, the rescue craft trying to make it thru the breakers, the sinking oil tanker, and the incredible rescue will leave you gasping for air. Despite the Hollywood ending, the fact that the basic facts are true leaves you in awe of these kinds of people, who, when faced with a disaster, run towards the problem, not away. It certainly makes me appreciate the Coast Guard a lot more than beforehand. These are tough people. The Finest Hours is a tough, solid film, with superb acting and high drama. I think you will enjoy it.",7,2,3,21 August 2016
The Equalizer," Excellent reboot of the TV series - Denzel delivers again
","I was a big fan of this TV show. I was excited to see this reboot, and especially with Denzel as Robert McCall, a simple day worker at a big box home depot type store, but with an unknown past.Denzel delivers in spades. His character is very slowly revealed as a vigilante type who takes no crap from any bad guy who wrongs the simple, hard-working, common person on the street. Kind of like the Charles Bronson Death Wish series. Some of the interactions are funny, especially with the other femme semi-lead, young lady hooker who dreams of being a singer, but is instead deep in over her head with Russian bad guys.Well, you know stuff is going to happen, and when it does, you want Robert McCall on your side. He takes on the Russians and other bad guys. The fight scenes are all slow-motion timed out choreographies that reveal part of Denzel's character's compulsion with organizing everything in his life.You learn only a little about his past, something to do with something powerful in some government agency, but there are little details given, other than the knowledge that this is a guy you do NOT mess with.The ending leaves the sequel door wide open, and I hope they follow this up while Denzel is still young enough to do this action stuff. One thing's for sure - next time I go to Home Depot or Lowes, I'm going to look at the guys there muccccch differently. Enjoy this excellent action flick.",8,0,2,9 May 2015
Source Code," Suspense keeps you guessing - Fine movie all around
","I rented Source Code from my library because I like Jake Gyllenhall, and had never really heard of this film.I was really surprised how good the whole package was. Gyllenhall is excellent as a military type name Colt whose last memories are of being in a combat mission in Afghanistan. Suddenly he finds himself waking up on a train near Chicago. He's like - yikes! what is going on, and who is this babe (Michelle Monaghan) talking to me that I don't know.Time goes along, and next thing you know, an event happens and now he finds himself if a metal box-like structure, with a military-type woman talking to him.He discovers he's part of this mission to try to find a bomber who is doing bad things around Chicago. As time goes along, he understands the gravity of the situation, what his real situation is, and what his options are. Then he goes back and repeatedly goes into this short time frame to try and find this bomber. It's really cool how each time he goes back, he has more and more comfort with his situation, because he keeps the memory of what he learned, and builds upon it. Gyllenhall skillfully plays with that to the max, especially at the end.Monaghan is terrifically cute and just the right foil for Gyllenhall's craziness. They have excellent chemistry. The movie succeeds with a terrific ending that only Hollywood can give you.This movie is a combo of so many different films, but it's still different, and keeps you guessing. Combine like Groundhog Day, Memento, Total Recall, and part of the Matrix, and you have Source Code. Outstanding work, really worth your time. Enjoy",8,1,3,4 June 2014
Skyfall," Gritty tough Bond film
","Strap yourself in for one non-stop action Bond film that should please fans and non-fans alike. Daniel Craig again turns in a fantastic portrayal of 007 who returns against all odds to take on a demon from the past. But whose past is it? That's never quite clear, but what is clear is that Javier Bardem is a fantastic bad guy. Your reaction to the word 'rat' will forever change after you see this movie, and the opening scene where bad guy introduces himself to Bond. Classic Bond.The usual Bond-like actions take place, like long exciting chase scenes, beautiful panoramas, and of course, beautiful women. You do feel sorry for many things in this movie, but all good things must eventually come to an end. The new Q is great, a bit of a twit, but, well, you'd expect nothing less in a Bond film. I had my doubts about Daniel Craig, having been such a big fan of Pierce Brosnan as Bond, but I have to say that he's been terrific. A real physical force, with less debonair style, but more in-your-face toughness than we've seen in a long time from Bond. I like it, and I hope he's able to make a few more films before he ages out, and the next Bond is born.Skyfall...Skyfall...Bond: done. Cool, just cool. If you don't like it, I have a license to kill. Enjoy this terrific flick.",8,2,10,27 April 2014
Catch Me If You Can," Funny, Serious, Thoughtful, Low-key film - Spielberg Delivers
","I loved Catch Me If You Can, based on the real-life story of Frank Abagnale. Abagnale, portrayed beautifully by Leonardo DiCaprio), is a young kid who runs away from home and uses his guile, wits, charm, and good looks to con his way into real-life professions that take years of training. Pilot, Doctor, Lawyer, this 19 year old kid can do all theses things, or pretend to. What made him want to do this?The film centers around the father-son relationship. Christopher Walken is outstanding as Frank Sr, a down-on-his-luck entrepreneur who has problems with the IRS coming after him for tax violations. But nothing bothers Frank Sr. He always keeps saying how he's the mouse who is going to survive by working harder. Yet, he seems to survive using smoke and mirrors, sweet talking people, and teaching his son that the image is more powerful than substance.Frank Jr learns all these lessons and applies them to all aspects of his life, chasing women, jobs, and all the money and benefits these bring. But it seems he really just wants a happy family, something he didn't ever seem to have. His mother, played by famous French actress Natalie Baye, doesn't seem to really love him. She mostly ignores his existence.Why should you see this film? The story is terrific, just the right pace of action and suspense. Is he going to get caught now? How is he going to pull this one off? The direction from Spielberg is right on. He tied everything together with no questions lingering at the end.The acting is terrific too. Tom Hanks delivers a masterpiece as an obsessed FBI agent Hanratty who is in charge of capturing Abagnale who ends up stealing millions of dollars by the time he is through. The relationship between the pursuer Hanratty and the pursued Abagnale is great, and the movie portrays them as developing a relationship of friendship. Other characters play strong roles too, including a young Amy Adams as as love interest for Frank Jr.I also loved the historical aspect of the airlines and the 60s, when pilots and flight attendants were considered glamorous positions. The old cars, the old uniforms, the costume designer and the cinematography really made the old times come to life with vibrant colors and a pizazz that maybe it didn't have, but it was nice to relive.Story, Director, Acting, Cinematography - Catch Me If You Can has it all. I highly recommend you catch this movie if you can. Enjoy.",8,1,3,27 December 2015
Iron Man 3," Best of the Series - don't believe the whiners!
","Contains Spoilers I just cannot believe all these whiners who are shredding this movie to bits. This was the best of the 3 IM movies so far.IM1 was OK, first in the new franchise. Ridiculous ending where Stark admits he's IM. IM two came up with this bogus villain. Really not fulfilling. Pretty slow story for a superhero movie.My expectations were low for IM3, but when I saw the Mandarin was in it, I said, great, finally one of IM's longtime villains takes him on. Yes, I will admit that seeing the Mandarin reduced to a puppet was hard to take. But you know, already the franchise had changed so much from the comics, that I said, WTH, just go with it.So the Disney aspect takes over, and you just have fun. Seeing Stark suffer physical and mental pain was a great story line. Seeing Pepper finally get more action was great. This kid, a little annoying, but hey, again, it's a Disney film, so they all have kids. Get over it.RDJ was fantastic. Again. Guy Pearce also fantastic as the bad guy. I loved this movie. Just jettison your attachment to the old IM comics, and you'll enjoy it too. This is from a longtime IM fan, proud owner of IM#1 comic (the real IM#1)",9,2,8,6 May 2013
John Wick," Bloody brutal non-stop flick
","John Wick leaves you breathless from the amount of action and killing. If you enjoy simple stories with a lot of guns, killings, and simple dialog, this movie is for you.These stupid spoiled rich Russian kids unknowingly attack John Wick, and start the fuse that leads to massive unbridled mayhem in the city. Wick is an assassin who cannot be defeated, apparently, since they've made a John Wick 2. But it's not for wont of trying because boy do the bad guys through everything at him including the kitchen sink.Keanu Reeves does a good job of being stoic, every so often throwing out clich√© lines as he's killing people non stop. I loved his interaction with his associate Wilem Defoe, which was a highlight of the movie. The story is simple. The plot is not complicated. the action is heart stopping. If you like these kinds of movies, you won't be disappointed. Good luck - be prepared for the ride.",6,1,3,7 May 2017
Lone Survivor," Emotionally and Physically Draining Film
","Wow, I cannot recall being this moved by a film in a long time. The story depicts a real-life story of a team of Navy Seals sent into a Taliban area in Afghanistan to take out a major leader. Based on the title of the film, you already know something is going to go wrong, so that's not a spoiler.The days-long battle scenes are gripping and intense. You cannot take your eyes away as little by little, you feel things are slipping away for these guys. Yet they don't give up. Ever.The training scenes at the beginning give you a hint, just a hint, of how tough you have to be to be a Seal. All that training came to bear in this ordeal. But the strongest part of them is the brotherhood they develop, and keep, forever, through whatever happens. Man are they tough, which comes through loud and strong in this film.The acting is taut and spot on. The story is unrelenting. The climax builds and drags you into an emotional roller coaster. Some beautiful music in the final credits, with a special David Bowie song, and real life clips of these people - had me in tears sobbing. It's an emotionally moving movie that stands out as an exceptional war film, and a fitting tribute to brave troops fighting against terrorism worldwide.Well done, and thanks for bringing this story to life. This movie will stay with you a long time. Enjoy.",8,0,1,24 August 2014
Star Trek," Great start to rebooted Star Trek movies
","When Leonard Nimoy passed away this week, I thought it time to catch some of his last Star Trek appearances. The Star Trek movie 2009 does not disappoint.If you are a fan of the original series, you will love how this movie brings in many of the qualities of the original. Kirk as a brash, no- holds-barred kid who fears nothing. Spock battling his biracial status. Bones with his country doctorness. Checkov not being understood by the computer because of his accent. Sulu sword fighting. Scotty being able to do anything and laugh about it. But Uhura being ultra sexy and manning up to Spock - that was just great.The evil Nero as the nemesis, and what he does, is incredible. The movie moves fast and furious as this space ship from the future comes to destroy the past. Common theme, with a great twist around Spock and Vulcan. Love the action. Love the ending how Kirk and Spock conspire and like in the originals, split second timing saves the day. When the bad guy gets his due, you will cheer when Kirk says - You got it.It's an enjoyable fast-paced movie that will have you cheering and leave you wanting more. Enjoy.",8,1,1,8 March 2015
Fury," Somewhat standard war movie
","Fury is a pretty standard war movie. The big attraction being Brad Pitt, who does a decent job as the head of a tank in WW2 in Europe. Tank crews were vastly overpowered by German tanks. This movie shows that even in a tank, you are really vulnerable.There is a weak storyline where you don't really learn much about the characters, other than this new kid who gets drafted as a replacement to one of the crew who gets killed. The plot is very thin in this movie. People die. People kill people. Good people get wrongfully killed. It gets a bit tedious without much of a story to cling to.In the end, it seemed almost Terminator-esque as the tank battles the evil humans. I think Hollywood got a little too full of itself with the final scene, which leaves you with a - so what - moment. No big surprises. The acting is good, the tank scenes with firearms coming at you at 1000 mph is terrific. But without a strong story or plot, it's just a tank driving around and stuff happens. I've seen much worse films, so I recommend you rent this from your library for free. Enjoy.",6,0,6,4 September 2015
World War Z," Ho Humh...Just your standard Zombie movie
","If you set your expectations low, you won't be disappointed in this rather standard Zombie movie. With the exception of having Brad Pitt as the star, and having really fast-running Zombies, there's really nothing the differentiates this movie from your standard Zombie flick.Something happens...ooohh...things start exploding...ahh..crazy people start running around, and boy are they fast. The Zombie craze spreads. Luckily Brad has some sort of special skill, though it didn't look like it to me. He just basically flew around the world asking questions. Reminds me of The International, except with Zombies instead of murderers.The movie attempts to play to your heartstrings by plucking on his family's plight (wife and 2 girls). How sweet - Brad would rather be with them than flying around the globe saving the world as he gets chased by bloodthirsty Zombies. How boring that would be.This movie is pretty stupid, and the non-Zombies are sometimes very stupid, but that stupidity really added nothing to the plot or story. The acting was average. The cast was average. The screenplay was average. The CGI was above average because these Zombies really knew how to climb and run and kill people. If that makes it a good movie for you, jump right in.Finally, the kitsche ending makes you cringe as you say to yourself....jeez I hope they are not setting us up for WWZ2? Enjoy, if you dare...ooh zombies bad, non-zombies good!!! I recommend you pass and wait for it to come out free in your library.",4,0,1,7 July 2014
Passengers," Not as good as I hoped for
","Passengers attempts to be the space version of Castaway, but comes up short.Sometime in the future, humans in hibernation are taking ship rides that last 120 years to far off colonies to start new lives. Stuff happens that awakens Jim (Pratt) way early in the trip. He faces a life alone where he most surely will die alone in space because everyone else is in hibernation. Pratt works hard to build up the desperation of his situation. They even have him grow a Tom Hanks-like beard. But the movie goes way too slowly with too many bar scenes. Other things happen and Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora Lane gets introduced into the story. Thank God you say because she adds the spice and sizzle that this movie advertised, which Pratt alone could not deliver.The Pratt/Lawrence cat and mouse game is the best part of this movie. Let's just say that they live a lifetime of emotions in the space of this movie. They face controversy, deceit, lies, plus life and death choices. In the end, the plot is just not strong enough to make this movie special. It's entertaining, good acting, but it just takes too long to get to the point, and moves too slowly. If I have to watch Lawrence go swimming one more time so we can see her body, I think I'll puke. Passengers is a decent film, with good acting, but lacks a strong story. You should buy a ticket, then set your expectations accordingly and you'll do OK. Enjoy.",6,1,1,7 May 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Excellent follow up to Star Trek Reboot
","JJ Abrams returns in this sequel to the Star Trek reboot movies. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana and the new cast return. Kirk uses his discretion around a Prime Directive and his command is threatened. Suddenly a new bad guy surfaces and starts reeking havoc on Star Fleet. who is this guy - seems like a super human.Well only Kirk can go after this bad guy named Harrison, rogue ex-Star Fleet staff. Venturing into Klingon territory, we learn the truth about Harrison. We also learn the truth about some factions in Star Fleet. Kirk again needs to decide if he can do the right thing in face of tremendous pressure, as does Spock. A fine battle takes place between good and bad, with a surprise ending that long time trekkies will appreciate. Even tribbles play a key role.The movie is fast paced again. The acting and portrayal against the original characters once again is spot on, particularly Dr McCoy and Scotty. You gotta love these guys - you can see the cast is having a blast with this. You will too. I can't wait for the next installment in these new Star Treks. Enjoy.",8,4,7,11 March 2015
Creed," Wished there was more Rocky in this film
","I was disappointed when Stallone didn't win the Oscar this year, but after finally seeing Creed, the reason was clear. There just were not enough scenes with Rocky where he could really act. The story was there, but there was too much time spent on Creed's girlfriend. Really, who really cares about her story. They tried to recreate similar interest like with Adrian/Rocky but it falls flat. She's a singer, but that brings up the whole music of the film. Music falls flat - you won't hear more than one note from any of the Rocky films. the new music just sucked.There is a twist, makes you think of Burgess Meredith, but in the end I really wished the story had concentrated more on Rocky, and on the Rocky/Creed relationship. It's too bad, because this was probably Stallone's only last shot at an Oscar. The ending is predictable, but you will smile. This should be in for Rocky, but heh, you never know. Enjoy.",7,0,1,2 July 2016
Spotlight," Gripping, emotional, and sadly, true
","Spotlight is a gem, a must-see film. Spotlight was a special group of Boston Globe reporters tasked with taking on deep investigative stories that took a lot of effort. Boy did they hit the jackpot with the Catholic priest scandal.In the early 2000's, it was discovered that, the greater Boston Diocese knowingly allowed pedophile priests to continue working, transferring them from one parish to another, and putting them in places for 'rehabilitation', right in neighborhoods. This movie depicts the steps taken by the reporting team, led by Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, and Rachel McAdams, to get to the truth. Liev Schreiver also delivers as the new managing editor who comes in to direct Spotlight's work when he smells the story that no one else goes near. In Boston, the Catholic church is sacrosanct. But Schreiver is not from Boston, so he feels no compunction to handle this story any differently than any other story of corruption and abuse of power.Bit by bit, the reporters, working with the lawyer played by Stanley Tucci, peel off the layers of the onion to discover the sordid, bitter truth. The trail of corruption leads to the highest levels of the church, sending shock waves still felt to this day.This is a no-nonsense film that will stick with you long afterwards. You will feel disgusted and saddened by the horrible things done by people who supposedly represent God on Earth. I don't think any of the reporters knew what they were getting into, but at the end, they were all emotionally shaken to get the facts.Excellent acting by all, and wonderful, taut direction was rewarded with the Best Picture Academy award, and 6 Academy nominations.If you want to see a gripping, moving, and emotional true story, go see Spotlight, which sheds light on the darkest parts of the shameful, hidden Catholic church's behavior.",8,1,2,21 August 2016
Concussion," Terrific film - Will Smith excels
","This is one of the best football-related films I've seen. You see the stark, tragic reality of how any corporation abuses workers and doesn't really care if they live or die, as long as the money rolls in. But we love football, so it's OK, right? I don't think you'll feel the same after watching this film.This film is based on the true story of Dr Bennet Omalu (Will Smith), a Nigerian doctor with multiple degrees, who discovered Chronic Tragic Encephalopathy (CTE) in football players. Omalu was a pathologist who found life in the dead patients he autopsied. Taking place in Pittsburgh, Omalu notices that football players are doing strange things that don't match the condition of their brains to their age. His journey is just beginning when he discovers massive damage to ex-players' brains.Alec Baldwin also stars as Dr Bailes, ex-team Doctor who believes in the science that shows CTE is real. Baldwin strikes the right amount of righteous indignation at the NFL executives as they reign in the stagecoaches to protect their sport from attack.The Director Landesman weaves a nice story that slowly pulls you in to believing, as player after player succumb to tragedy. The scenes weave through multiple lives, but you are never lost - excellent connections were built to keep you on track. Besides Smith and Baldwin, there were great performances from Albert Brooks as Dr Wecht, Smith's prot√©g√©/mentor, and newcomer Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Prema, a recent immigrant from Kenya seeking a helping hand in a new land.Tension gets ratcheted up slowly but surely, leaving you wondering and hoping that sanity prevails. The ending won't leave you cheering, but rather, wondering, wondering about why it always seems to take death to get businesses to change.Concussion is a must-see movie. Enjoy.",8,2,5,20 April 2016
Hotel Rwanda," Gut-wrenching true story of courage
","In the face of true human evil, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) stood up and said Not on my Watch. Cheadle plays the real-life role of hotel manager during the 1994 genocide of the Tutsi sect people by the Hutu sect majority. At the beginning of the film, before the killing starts, you learn that people were arbitrarily assigned to one of the two sects based on physical characteristics, which makes the killing even more unbelievable.Hotel Des Milles Collines is the one place of refuge in the middle of mayhem once the genocide starts. Cheadle uses guile, tactics, stalling, bargaining, bribing, begging, every tool in his toolkit to try to save as many as he can. Reminiscent of Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda shows what one compassionate man can mean to so many others' lives when he's the only one that can do anything.Rusesabagina loves his family, and that is portrayed over and over again, especially in many heart-wrenching scenes with his wife when he tells her what she must do if death comes near them.Tension, plot, great acting, despair. Nick Nolte is terrific as the UN peacekeeper leader who has guns but no mandate or authority to use them. Excellent acting by the evil General and the evil supplier. The way the Director Terry George portrays the carnage, especially the river road scene, will stay with you for a long time. Genocide never makes sense, is never understandable to the sane person, but never has it been so palpably seen as in Hotel Rwanda. thankfully the Hollywood ending is actually true. If you have time, watch some of the special features where the real Paul Rusesabagina talks about the reality of that time. This movie will restore your faith in good people doing amazing things when faced with evil. Enjoy.",8,2,2,18 June 2017
Malcolm X," Good historical film with strong cast
","Denzel anchors this biopic about the life of activist Malcolm X. You learn about his young beginnings, youthful upbringing, how he became transformed into the Islamic leader, then his eventual disillusionment and further transformation.This story was a fascinating view with strong acting by Denzel. He seems to thrive in characters where he can go a little over the top though, and at times, that can get a bit tiring, much like in the more recent Fences, where his non-stop action is something you cannot keep up with. Malcolm X was a bit like that, but you saw that Malcolm had a deliberateness and an immediacy to his actions that pushed action.The setting was inner city with excellent costumes. His friend shorty and his other crew grew up to support and eventually adore Malcolm, but he also gained enemies. As his views started to venture from the strict Islam line, he created enemies. The film got a bit slow at times, but Angela Basset as his girl helped bring a nice evenness to the plot by solidly standing by her man thru thick and thin. This movie was a fascinating view of how a person can change colors, while always still doing the right thing according to their convictions. Such morals as Islam play a big role in our world today. Watching Malcolm X will help you understand how there can be good parts to it, but also abuses of it that are not good.I hope you enjoy Malcolm X.",7,2,8,16 September 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America Takes Charge
","I was lucky enough to get this film from my local library, so I watched it several times. I love many of these Marvel films, but the Captain America ones are the best...better than Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, or Spiderman. Maybe it's Chris Evans good looks and goody two shoes qualities, or the good guys fighting the bad bad guys. But Cap America has a storyline that works.You really can't talk much about this film without giving out spoilers. Just be ready for some major changes. My fave scene by far is the elevator scene where it becomes obvious who is on what side. Plenty of great fighting, and as you'd expect, a finale involving Cap and Winter Soldier. It would have been cool for Cap to get together with Black Widow, but it seems that at least for now, not happening. Keep it up Marvel. enjoy.",8,1,2,30 September 2014
Interstellar," Thoughtful movie
","Interstellar gets you thinking about lots of things, mostly those lost opportunities and the regrets you have from NOT doing what you wanted to when you could do it. In that vein, the bending of time that takes place throughout the movie gives you plenty of ways to be introspective, and maybe even have a second chance.Enter Matt Mcconaughy as the somewhat frustrated lead, Cooper, who is a farmer on a dying planet, instead of a jet pilot, which he is trained to do. He's raising two young kids on his own, Murph being the most visible, and actually a brilliant young mind. His son Tom seems more obedient and is ready to take over the household when Coop gets sent on a mission to save humanity. Professors Brand (father and daughter) are played by Michael Caine and Annie Hathaway, are terrific. The acting in general is strong. The movie is almost 3 hours long but it moves along quickly.Throughout the mission, you wonder if they will find the new planet, what is going on back on earth, what year is it back on earth (because gravity does some incredible warping and compressing of time it seems). You need to suspend reality as you watch this movie, and think, OK, well, that's cool.In the end, this movie neatly combines human emotions, hope, family, with technical wizardry and excellent storytelling to deliver a must-see movie that will inspire deep emotions in you. Enjoy.",8,0,6,4 September 2015
Full Metal Jacket," excellent start but falls flat in second half
","I have been rewatching war films lately and just finished with Full Metal Jacket about the Vietnam war era. The story covers the lives of several recruits from boot camp thru to battle in Vietnam.The best part is the first half of the movie at boot camp. The drill sergeant, played by Lee Ermey, blows you away with an unbelievably vivid depiction of the cruelty handed out by drill sergeants to new recruits. This part of the movie moves along nicely, showing you day after day how the training wears down the recruits into a single unit. However, one recruit Gomer Pyle, played by a young Vincent D'onofrio from TV's Law and Order, has a screw loose. And the screw gets looser and looser until the final scene of boot camp that literally blows you away.Then, poof, the bottom falls out of the movie, as Joker (played OK by Modine) gets assigned to be a journalist in Vietnam. He displays a sly wit while he has Born to Kill on his helmet, but wears a peace badge. He's supposed to be cynically sarcastic about the role of the marines in Vietnam, but I felt his acting left something to be desired.In Vietnam, he meets up with his buddy Cowboy, and they reminisce about things. Joker wants to see some action, so he joins the squad as they march thru this city. Bombs happen, shootings happen, snipers happen. But the action is not well-linked. I did not feel pulled into the action to feel the tension, not like from other better war movies like Saving Private Ryan, Born on the 4th of July, or especially Platoon.In the final scene, with the Joker coming to grips with what war really does and what it can bring out in an otherwise normal human being, again, it fails to excite, and falls flat, just like the ending. Man, see Charlie Sheen in Platoon if you want to see the benchmark that Full Metal Jacket fails to reach.I will soon rewatch Platoon, and possibly Apocalypse Now. But I don't strongly recommend Full Metal Jacket because after the boot camp, it fails poorly. Based on the great boot camp filmography alone, I give it a 6/10 overall. Good luck.",6,0,1,18 June 2014
Pacific Rim," Knock out hit
","Pacific Rim is a surprisingly good monster movie with real plot lines that drive the movie to success. PR is way better than any Godzilla flic because it weaves an actual story involving people, not just cardboard characters that bring nothing to the story.Some time in the future, Kaiju (Japanese for Beasts) start to emerge from a breach in the tectonic plates under the Pacific ocean. Humans end up creating Jaegers (German for Hunter), huge robot fighting machines, to stop the Kaiju. These robots are massive - tall as skyscrapers, and weigh thousands of tons.The story pulls you in because the world is under siege and countries actually cooperate with each other for self survival. Your interest starts at the country level, while director Del Toro quickly brings it down to a level you can better identify with - the one-on-one type. You learn about a Jaeger pilot, Raleigh (played by unknown Charlie Hunnam), and his brother. These Jaegers require two pilots to operate them, left brain/right brain, because the neural stress is too much for one person. These brother pilots go out on a hunt and things go bad. There's a terrific fight scene in Alaska with a beach scene that introduces you to the sacrifices these people make to save the world. The story then pulls you in and never lets go.Raleigh gives up piloting and takes up construction to help build a wall that no one believes can stop these monsters, but he withdraws from the world. Until we then meet Commander Stacker, played masterfully by Idris Elba - he was terrific. The story then goes all over the world, from New York to California, to England, to Hong Kong. Other interesting characters come into play, led by Mako (Rinko Kikuchi - actually a pretty well-established actress). Two crazy scientists, a con/Kaiju parts dealer (Ron Perlman is excellent), and internal adversaries join the excellent cast.Casting was terrific. Raleigh and Mako have great chemistry on screen. Cmdr Stacker exudes leadership. Crazy scientists excude wild abandon in search of science. Bad guys are heartless. In the end, internal adversaries bond together, and it was all terrifically believable due to the casting. The acting was also top notch. All actors gave strong performances in their roles.The cinematography was uneven, mostly due to lighting. As Jaegers and Kaiju did battle in various scenes, just like the Transformer movies, it was often hard to tell who was doing what to whom because of the darkness. Smashing battles in the city were easier, and monsters spewing colored venom helped, but that's my major issue with the movie. Better lighting definition would have drawn me in more to the fight scenes, which were numerous.By far the best part of the movie, after the excellent storyline, was the CGI. The robot hunters were very realistic. The computer control rooms were very realistic, as were the graphics used by the Jaeger pilots in their control room. You never felt the monstors or robots were out of scale to themselves or their surroundings, which is often an issue with cheaper CGI films, like the old Godzilla vs Mothra type movies. The monsters were really well done too. You could tell that the fight scenes took a lot time and care to make them very realistic.Pacific Rim succeeds on every level, while throwing in a cliche here and there, and your expected Hollywood ending. You'll feel happy, sad, happy/sad, and relate to these poor people fighting for their lives against all odds. Story, acting, casting, directing, CGI, oh, and the music too, which strongly supported the story. All were great.PR is a must-see film for monster-movie enthusiasts and general film lovers alike.

American Sniper," Interesting story with good acting
","I liked American Sniper because of the story and strong acting. Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper) was raised in Texas and taught to stand up for himself by his Dad, who also taught him to shoot. He was living an underachieving life it seemed when events caused him to enlist as a Navy Seal at the age of 30. When he makes it, he gets drafted into the Sniper team, and begins four tours of duty in Iraq I guess it is. The story reports he became the highest performing sniper ever with 160 kills. Chris Kyle is real, and this movie was based on his book.Clint Eastwood directed this story. He certainly added some Hollywood material, like this cat and mouse game between Kyle and an Iraqi sniper Mustafa that plays out continually. Since we have no idea what Mustafa was really like, this whole section was created. Sienna Miller plays Kyle's wife and does a surprisingly good job of holding her own, delivering some gut-wrenching pleas for her man to return home.The best part of this film is the acting from Bradley Cooper. Kyle did four tours of duty, over 1000 days of combat, and he never seemed to fully shake what this required him to do - be always vigilant and alert. He obviously suffered medically from stress and other PTSD symptoms. this part of his life was brilliantly scripted by Eastwood and performed by Cooper.The story itself however holds no major surprises since it's based on a book, and a lot of newspaper material that you certainly heard and read. So the ending is not a shocker, but still sad, and Eastwood, as often directors do, weaves in real-life footage to bring home the point.Whether all that is shown is true, that's up to you to judge. But I encourage you to watch American Sniper because the story is well written, but mostly the acting was excellent. Enjoy.",7,8,11,15 September 2015
Rocky II," Fine installment in the Rocky series
","Rocky 2 was on TV the other night, so I sat down and watched. If you are an American, the Rocky series is like coming home, especially the first 4 movies. Just relax and Rocky will win you over. He's a simple guy, with a simple life. It's simple, except he gets this chance to fight the heavyweight champ, Apollo Creed, again.You recall from Rocky 1, that won Best Picture in the Oscars in 1976, that Rocky went the distance against Creed and lost on points. You know Rocky had guts, and the fire, and the will to give his best.In Rocky 2, Rocky becomes a bit fearful. His wife's pregnant, he's afraid of further damage to his eye, and hey, maybe he's fearful that the first fight against Creed really was a fluke.Well, the movie plods along, just like Rocky's boxing style, but it keeps advancing, getting you along with it. But boom, once the will kicks in, Rocky gives it his all. That's what I love about all these Rocky movies. He promotes the passion that if you give it your all, and work really hard, and want something enough, you can get there. You may not always win, but you can hold your head up proudly.OK, sometimes it gets a bit too much, and overboard, but that is always the main driving theme in all these Rocky films, Rocky 2 being no different.Rocky 2 returns the excellent cast, Stallone, Creed, Burgess Meredith is still terrific as the gnarly old boxing trainer Micky. What a terrific actor. I bet he taught Stallone a thing or two about acting and emotion. So settle in, relax, and enjoy this pure entertainment that will always have you cheering at the end for Rocky. Win or lose, you will always cheer him on. Enjoy!",7,1,2,7 July 2014
Lion," Unbelievable tear-jerker
","Lion tells the story of a very young boy in India who gets separated from his family for 25 years and his struggle to piece together his past.Dev Patel plays the older Saroo and is outstanding. He delivers terrific emotion at all the right times. Nicole Kidman is of course outstanding as his adoptive mother. But the real star is the young boy Sunny Pawar who plays the young Saroo. He was just outstanding for such a young actor.I think the movie could have been better by shortening the sequences of Saroo's anguishing over his past. And we would have benefited from learning more about Saroo and Mantosh. It would have been great to see more growing up scenes with Kidman, though you got enough of a picture to see that the kids were treated wonderfully.The Hollywood ending isn't one, because it's a totally true story, which makes Lion even more unbelievable. This is the kind of movie to watch when you think YOU are having trouble. Think of this poor young boy lost and alone in a city of millions and your problems should drift away.Roony Mara's role as the older love interest seemed to be like a throw in, just as a foil for Patel. I wonder if she was real or added in.Anyhow, solid acting, great cinematography, you'll love Lion. It could just have been tightened up in editing a bit more. Enjoy",7,3,5,18 June 2017
Southpaw," Southpaw packs a punch
","Jake Gyllenhal delivers another terrific performance, this time as boxing champ Billy Hope. JakeG rips your guts out with his emotional performance as this somewhat crazed boxer who seems to thrive on taking punishment before he delivers a knockout blow.Billy has seen it all, having grown up on the streets, in child care. He's been there. Rachel McAdams plays Mo, his wife Maureen he met on the streets who understands him like no other. Finally their daughter Leila played by Oona Laurence gives a pretty good account for herself against this formidable acting group.When tragedy befalls Billy, something he feels guilty for, everything falls apart. He has to dig deep, deeper than he ever has had to, to resurrect himself. Everything that matters to him is on the line. Forest Whitaker as Tick Wills takes him in and agrees to train him.As plots go, you've seen this movie before with a boxer who's on top one day, then down and out the next. However, what's different here is the power from Gyllenhal, and the film skill of director Antoine Fuqua. The camera angles are terrific, with blurry POV images that put you right there in the fighter's head. The music is top notch too.What would have made this a great film would have been a bit more background on Billy's past, and on Tick's, because without more info on that, you have to assume they lost something and will fight till the death to get it back. Terrific acting, excellent direction, and a decent story line. See Southpaw for all this and more. Enjoy.",7,0,0,3 September 2016
Ant-Man," Ant-man is Cool!
","Ant-Man is a cool movie that delivers the right combo of action, seriousness, drama, and comedy. The story revolves around the original founder, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) who discovers technology that can shrink a human to the size of ants. Not only that, but his technology also allows him to lead ants to help him in various ways.20 years or so after the fact, Pym's prot√©g√©, Cross (Corey Stoll) is on the verge of finally replicating Pym's work, but he intends to make money from it, not benefit humankind. The battle is on between Pym and Cross, with Pym's daughter Hope (Evangenline Lilly) working undercover within Cross's organization.Then enter Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a cat burglar extraordinaire who Pym deems as the best candidate to put on his Ant-Man suit that he has kept hidden all this time, and use his skills to stop Cross before it's too late.The story is fascinating. The CGI is incredible, with the small sized combatants doing incredible stuff, and funny stuff too. The acting is really terrific from Douglas and Rudd, but a huge kudos to Rudd's partner in crime, Luis (Michael Pena), who delivers some incredible dialog that really blew me away with the editing to make it work big time. Cory Stoll really reminded me a lot of the performance of Ted Levine in Silence of the Lambs - very good stuff.There's also a fantastic flashback scene of Pym when he was 20 or more years younger, and there was Michael Douglas, when he was late 30's or early 40's. How the CGI people do this is incredible - like the latest Terminator Genisys movie with Schwartzenegger from now fighting against the original Terminator.At almost 2 hours length, it's just the right amount of story, as the movie moves along quickly. I had never heard of Director Peyton Reed, but after this success, I'm sure we'll be hearing more from him. It also looks like Ant-Man will get somehow tied into the Avengers series, based on the number of cross references between these movies.Ant-Man delivers an excellent non-stop film that will leave you cheering. Crawl on down to watch it. Enjoy.",8,1,4,2 January 2016
American Hustle," Superb acting - wild story
","American Hustle is one of those movies that you will spend time afterwards thinking - what happened, who did what, why? You know, similar to Memento when you keep thinking about what was real versus flashback or future view.The strongest part of this movie is the incredible acting delivered by all the characters. Christian Bale is fabulous - how does he go from Batman to a fat con man? He delivers big time, as does Amy Adams as his co-con in crime. Jeremy Renner also delivers as this somewhat crooked politician who is trying to do good, or at least, you think so. I didn't like Bradly Cooper as the FBI agent, but maybe that's why he was good. He comes off as a total dufus. Finally Jennifer Laurence delivers a fine performance as a messed-up housewife used to living the lie on Long Island. Bought and paid for, but she always wants more. And somewhat of a ditz who insists she's smart. Yeah right. Terrific acting all around.The plot is what kind of drags the movie around. You try to hang in there and figure out who is who, good or bad guy, FBI, mobster. Mostly it keeps you guessing who is the con and who is being conned. This movie may have you recalling The Sting, with Paul Newman and Robert Redford, if you want to see something similar.I am not surprised this didn't win any big awards at the Oscars. It's a very interesting film, but no real big - oh or ahs, or I see now time moments. Just an entertaining film that will leave you fulfilled with terrific acting, but a hard to follow script. I think you'll enjoy it. I did.",7,0,3,27 July 2014
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Robin Williams Rocks the Airwaves!
","Robin Williams stars as Adrian Cronauer, an Air Force Dee-jay who has been brought to Vietnam to be on the airwaves there, ostensibly because he was funny when he was a Dee-jay in Crete. There is a real Adrian Cronauer, and this story is based on him, but the marketers never advertise this as based on a true story, so you know this must be mostly Hollywood at work.Cronauer's style is unique, wild, wacky, crazy, with tons of voice impressions and just off-the-wall stories and personalities streaming out of the head of Williams/Cronhauer into the ears of the troops. It's a huge departure from the typically monotone, boring, and heavily censored radio entertainment, and the troops love it!Forrest Whitaker also stars as Ed Garlick, a fellow radio Dee-jay and kind of the mentor to Cronauer. Once Cronauer gets settled, the story centers around two themes: 1\ his battle against the uptight stations owners, played beautifully by J.T. Walsh (See Breakdown - great bad guy) as the Sgt Major and Bruno Kirby as Lt. Haulk who desperately wants to be funny, and believes he is, but no, he's just not. And 2\ his attraction to a young Vietnamese woman he sees passing on the street, Trinh (played by Chintara Sukapatana who went on to become an actress with some credits). Cronauer develops a friendship with Trinh's brother Tranh, and Cronauer slowly realizes that the cultural division between him and Tranh is wide and probably insurmountable. Barry Levinson directs this masterpiece, with excellent taut movement from scene to scene - not much wasted moments here. See Rainman and The Natural from some of his other gems.In the end, what happens is pretty much what you might expect, but it doesn't make it less heartfelt an emotional pull for the viewer. I wouldn't describe this as an anti-war film, but more so, as a film that encourages you to question the status quo as you go through life, which is certainly what Cronauer did, in spades. Enjoy this fine film!",8,4,5,20 September 2015
Burn After Reading," Terrible story - don't waste your time
","Like many saps I'm sure, I was suckered in by the pretty face of a great cast. How could you possibly go wrong with a cast like this? Well I'll tell you how - give them a stupid plot with a non-sensical wanna be storyline, and you've got a bomb like this. I don't know if all these so-called reviewers watched the same movie I did, but this movie really stinks.The only bright spot was solid comedic acting by Brad Pitt. Tilda Swinton also gave a solid performance. But George Clooney and Frances McDormand, bless them, they were just too over the top. This whole movie tried to over the top the stupidity of Washington DC, the stupidity of people, the irony of fooling around on people coming back to bite you in the butt.spoiler alert ---- And George Clooney's idiotic character being passed off as a US Marshall? WTH was up with that? The final straw was his building that stupid idiotic dildo machine in his basement. I wanted to throw the remote at the screen when I saw that. Please, don't waste your time. These guys tried to imitate Quentin Tarantino and make something cool like Pulp Fiction. Instead, they made something akin to Lemon Pulp - leaves a sour taste in your mouth.",2,3,6,6 May 2013
The Killing Fields," Gut-wrenching Depiction of Post-Viet Nam Era Will Stay with You
","The 1970's was a time of tremendous political upheaval in the US. In The Killing Fields, Cambodia is the canvas, while politics, journalism, friendship, and the human will are the paints used to depict an in-your- face, true story of survival against all odds. The US government takes its lumps as we abuse, then abandon a people who are then embroiled in a bloody internal cleansing that kills several million Cambodians. The journalists Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and local Dith Pran (Dr Ngor) capture and transmit the daily atrocities back to the states for US consumption. Dr Ngor was an actual survivor of the real Killing Fields. How he had he courage to portray Dith Pran, I don't know, but it speaks to the courage he had, and apparently to promises he made to his wife to educate the world about what happened in Cambodia. That Dr Ngor won an Academy Award is astonishing, but after you watch this movie, you really feel like you lived through this horrific event because of Ngor's tremendous performance.Sam Waterston also turned in a strong performance as Shanberg. He realizes he took advantage of Pran as a means to his own ends, but by then, it's too late. Waterston was at his best when he stands toe to toe with Army reps, like Craig T. Nelson (from Coach), or the politicians. But near the end, when he has to take criticism from his own colleague who was with him (terrific performance by John Malkovich by the way), Waterston has no valid reply, and he knows it.The war scenes are incredibly real, the suffering in the killing fields is palpable, and the hopelessness of those trying to stem the entire unimaginable craze of hatred overtaking the Khmer Rouge is smothering.Some scenes are a bit long, and the ending would have been better without that particular song,which introduced a bit too much of a Hollywood ending at just the wrong time. Still, this is a must-see film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Enjoy.",8,0,0,28 April 2014
Baby Driver," Fast and Furious combined with Bank Robbers
","Baby Driver starts out with a lot of promise but takes way too long to get there. Baby is a young kid with unbelievable driving skills who, as we learn, gets drawn from a normal life into the life of bad guys and guns. He listens and lives out his life thru music, which is brought out in excellently choreographed coffee shop and chase scenes.The story develops and you learn about how the poor kid experienced childhood trauma. And you learn how he got pushed to the wrong side of the road. But when he meets his dream girl, he gains hope of escape. Can he, is the question, and the driving line underneath the entire movie.Along the way we meet some really bad people played by Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx. The mastermind, who I found a bit miscast, was Kevin Spacey. The banter between bad guys got pedantic after a while, with violence executed for the sake of it, without adding any value to the story. Baby's girlfriend smoothly moves from normal to abnormal life, which was probably trying to have us think of them as Bonnie and Clyde.Great driving scenes. Some witty lines. Some good music. But too long. This should have been over in 85 minutes, not 110. The director spent way too much time with useless dialog between bad guys and many useless scenes. The kids end up being stupid, and I found the ending predictable and contrived.But overall, it was an OK movie if you're ok with gratuitous violence, lots of blood, great car scenes, and stories of young love, both lost and found.",6,1,1,8 December 2018
The Village," Thought-provoking movie
","The village is a thought-provoking movie that deviates from the typical M Night Shyamalan, scare-the-crap-out-of-you movie like The Sixth Sense, The Happening, or Signs. Shyamalan does deliver his typical twist, that I found a bit predictable here, but I leave that part for you to decide.A village in the late 1800s/early 1900s lives in isolation from the other villages. It looks like a Quaker village, simple lives, no electricity, basic water, simple clothes. They don't allow the color red, there's some sort of aversion to it. No one is allowed to wander into the woods because there are creatures there who may attack you. The villagers stay in the village and they are safe. Or are they?Joaquin Phoenix delivers a powerful performance as Lucius, a young man who doesn't say much, but what he does exhibit is extreme courage. He is attracted to Ivy, a not-quite-totally blind girl, brilliantly acted by Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of Ron Howard, the famous actor/director from Happy Days and Apollo 13. Their attraction is one of the key story lines. Other key story lines are Adrien Brody as Noah, somewhat of a village idiot. Something not right upstairs. This craziness borders on obsession, and that is a key part of his personality and the film.Finally, a wonderful performance from Sigourney Weaver as a single, middle-aged woman with an unobtainable attraction to William Hurt, who plays pretty much the leader of the village, Edward Walker. There is a core group of elders, who meet to discuss the direction of the village, and that is the final key storyline. Why do they meet? What do they discuss? what are these boxes they all seem to have? Intriguing.Events happen that drive action, and if you paid attention during the movie, you have an inkling of the ending. It's a collision of hearts and minds with no clear resolution, except it gives you hope that, somehow, all will work out well for the village and its people.See The Village. There is terrific acting by all, an intriguing plot, and a thought-provoking ending. Enjoy.",7,1,2,3 October 2015
Bridge of Spies," Creative historical theme succeeds
","Bridge of Spies states that it is based on true events. It depicts the story of a Mr Abel (Mark Rylance), captured and accused of being a spy during he 1950's at the heart of the cold war between the US and Russia. Tom Hanks plays the Lawyer Jack Donovan who is offered the task of defending Mr Abel.Hanks does more than that, delivering a heartwarming portrayal of a good man who just wants to do good. After defending Abel and fighting for his survival, the US continues it's spying actions over Russia. Hanks is eventually asked to take a role that will challenge his nerves, his family, and his belief in all he believes in. Will he succeed in this role, or will he suffer the same horrible fate as so many East Germans?I really liked Bridge of Spies. The direction by Spielberg was excellent. The costume and scenery were great - really authentic. Hanks was terrific, and Rylance was good, though I think Rocky in Creed should have won the Academy Award. Through to the end, you wonder how this thriller will turn out. Watch Bridge of Spies to learn for yourself. It's a good, taut, few hours - and worth your while. Enjoy.",7,1,1,15 May 2016
The Patriot," Bloody but powerful
","The Patriot takes place during the American Revolutionary war against King George of England. Filmed entirely in South Carolina, per the credits, that provide a realistic background on which Emmerich painted the story.Mel Gibson as Benjamin Martin is a man who wants to eschew violence, knowing what the price is, and what it can do to your soul. This is usually a very good basic theme for films, because you see the person struggling against himself, and no one does it better than Gibson. He finds himself pushed headlong into something that he knows he should avoid, but cannot. His son Gabriel, played by Heath Ledger, wants to be like his Dad. Dad fears that his patriotic son will undergo the same fate as he. Dad loves his family of 7, and protects them fearlessly because he is a single parent.The battle scenes seem realistic for the time. I think the costume design and direction was terrific, adding to the bloody realism. That's the one negative from the film - it's in your face blood - left, right, center, back, forward. Maybe that was necessary to impart the stark realism, I am not sure. But it is there, so be warned.There are not too many happy moments in this film, and the ones there are bittersweet. There are many sad moments where you can't believe what is happening. Hollywood provides a Hollywood ending, no fear. But still, you walk away stunned and saddened at the whole somewhat tragic story.Patriot won 3 Academy awards, and is a fine picture. It's only the excess blood and somewhat long story at 2 3/4 hours, that makes me give it only a 7/10. The acting is top notch, as is the story, direction, and costume design. You will be moved by this story. Enjoy.",7,0,1,2 August 2014
Divergent," Teen flick delivers
","My teenage son is into these teen novels and he said Divergent was OK, so I took a shot.I found it similar to Harry Potter and Hunger Games. There are 5 Factions. You get to pick the one you want and somehow this is supposed to keep the peace after a 100-year war. Humhh.Like Hogwarts, the Factions represent different skill sets. Unlike Hogwarts, you get tested first, and a Faction usually comes out as dominant. I no dominant trait comes out, in rare cases, you are labeled a Divergent. The government, which apparently wants to control people, does not like Divergents, and they typically find them and make them disappear.Similar to Hunger Games with evil Donald Sutherland, except here you have Kate Winslet, who plays the evil government leader.The lead female character breaks from her family, and loves her family, but still has to do what she has to do. The training scenes are pretty good, and the story is entertaining. In the end, these stories leave the ending completely open, and you have to wait for part 2 to find out what happens next. I found the stories and characters interesting, while the acting was decent. I think you will enjoy this if you liked Hunger Games or Harry Potter. Enjoy.",7,0,1,27 December 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Another Mission Accomplished - Rogue Nation Rules
","I loved MI Rogue Nation. This franchise keeps delivering what the audience wants - Tom Cruise, an unbeatable bad guy, beautiful smart tough women, controversy, car/plane/bike chases, and an impossible mission. The usual cast of supporting characters are back to support Ethan Hunt who is somewhere in the world doing something to save us. The plane chase scene at the start is like the fuse lit at the beginning of all MI movies. You know then that you are in for action. The bad guy is this mysterious Syndicate leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). He is the cool bad guy who never seems to get riled, is always one step or more ahead, and has every detail planned with vicious cold- heartedness - the picture of the modern day terrorist. The beautiful spy is Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). She was pretty good, making you wonder throughout which side she really belongs to. Then there is the intrigue about the whole Syndicate - who is the leader? why are they doing these things? The story works really well I think.Can the MI team come back even though they are now (again?) unsanctioned? How can they stop a gang of ex-agents, bad guys, and all around terrible folks? How can they catch up to a guy who is always one step ahead? It's an impossible mission.Tom Cruise delivers another great performance, but you can only wonder how many more of these he has in him - at 53, he's getting a bit old for the physicality these roles require. But hey, what with the Expendables, and the Taken series, and Kevin Costner rejuvenating himself as a spy, you never know. If you like action movies, go see MI-Rogue Nation. Enjoy.",8,0,1,2 January 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man," Worthy reboot of spider-man series
","I liked this reboot of the spider-man series, despite some minor flaws. The new Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) did an excellent job in portraying a 17-year old filled with angst over age, death, love, and responsibility. His performance is even more amazing when you realize he is over 30 years old. Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) came off at the start as a bit smug and looked too old to portray a high schooler, but by the end, I thought she did a decent job.There are minor plot twists, but if you have a pulse, you know that Parker gets bitten by a spider with special powers, and he inherits those spider powers. That part came a bit fast in this movie, where next thing you know, Parker is spinning webs and flying all over the place.Martin Sheen turned in a fine performance as gentle uncle Ben, as did Sally Fields as Aunt May, though they could have tried to make her look a bit older. I remember her as a gray-haired granny type. I found the plot was a bit long in some scenes, and the movie probably could have been cut down 15 minutes to be around 2 hours. However, the action kept things moving, with enough fight scenes and the obligatory destruction whenever super heroes fight the bad guys. The CGI was terrific by the way, which goes without saying again in a modern super hero movie.Lastly, the Lizard character was well played by Rhys Ifans. I've never heard of him before but he was quite believable as a man on the edge, and then pushed over it by his regenerative serum. All told, fine acting, interesting enough story, and terrific cinematography make this a film worth your time. Hence, my score 7/10.",7,0,1,13 April 2014
Quantum of Solace," Modicum of Solace is more like it
","Quantum of Solace is an OK addition to the Bond series, though I think it restricted Daniel Craig's ability to flex much acting muscle. Maybe that was the point - nothing affects Bond, ever...?Bond has some pretty cool chase scenes, the opening one being along the Italian coast in a two lane tunnel. That must have been a challenge to film. There's another boat chase scene which has been done before, better, and a rooftop chase scene. Well, you get the point.Bond needs to find out what this Quantum group is and what they are after. They all use names like from Clue - Mr White, Mr Green. Mr Green is the key villain, and he's a slimy bastard if I must say so. He had some history with this film's Bond girl played by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko. She has revenge on her mind, as does Bond because of Quantum having led to the death of Bond's gal pal, Vesper, from a previous movie.M, still played by Judi Dench, turns in her usual stoic, strong performance. She's a terrific actress in everything she does. Otherwise, Bond flies around the world, fights bad guys, digs to the truth, and hits pay dirt. The one thing I liked best about Quantum was the big fight scene at the end. Typically there are monstrous buildings with huge things, and this time, well, it is a huge building, but being a hotel makes it more manageable. I could related to stairs falling and windows getting blown out. It was a very well done final fight scene that satisfies.In the end, Bond finds out what he needs to about Vesper, and declares he's ready for more, which of course, led to Skyfall.I think Daniel Craig was OK, but again, he was pretty restricted. I think we saw a much wider Bond character in Skyfall, which is why I'd highly recommend Skyfall, while Quantum you can put off to second or third choice. Enjoy.",6,0,3,19 July 2014
Non-Stop," good thriller
","You can't go wrong with a Liam Neeson film, for the most part. In non- stop, he plays this down on his luck air marshal who is on this transatlantic flight he gets called on to ride. He doesn't really like to fly, odd for someone with this job. Anyhow, there was something that had happened to him and gave him a bad reputation. He's drinking, kind of a loner, down on his luck.On board the flight he starts getting text messages that people will start getting killed unless he pays ransom. Then all sorts of crazy stuff starts happening, and the movie ratchets up the suspense. you are never really sure who is good vs bad, or why this event is even really happening. Then you figure it out, and Liam Neeson gets to flex his tough guy skin again, like in Taken or some of his other recent films. Julianne Moore plays this quirky lady passenger, yep, again, Femme mysterieuse and maybe she's too weird for some reason? The suspense was good, the acting was pretty good, and the film moves quickly. I recommend Non-Stop as a tidy, good thriller that you will enjoy.",7,1,3,12 October 2014
Revolutionary Road," Terrible - Avoid this bomb!
","Revolutionary Road stinks. The story was stupid. The acting was so-so. The dialog was asinine. The music was terrible too -this little jingle going on in the background to what, ramp up the drama? Please.My wife loves Leonardo and these types of movies usually, but even she was begging me to Fast Forward thru this mess.I can't even begin to tell you in detail how terrible this movie is. It seems that the Producers wanted to capitalize on a Titanic reunion of Dicaprio and Winslet, mixing in the odd storyline of this bomb, thinking that Sam Mendes could work his American Beauty masterpiece.Do Not Be Deceived. This movie just sucked. This couple is unhappy. Oh boo hoo, he has to commute to work each day. He didn't want to do what his father did, and that is where he is. Kate Winslet does nothing, and complains about it, so hey, let's move somewhere different. Then the idiotic sex scenes, awkward pauses, strange blow ups by various people, odd neighbors, all done with the 1950s look, and hey, you have a winner - give me a break. How Winslet was able to keep herself from laughing at her stupid lines is a miracle. Dicaprio had to really blow up a few times, but it just seemed forced, and like I said, stupid.I would give this a 0 rating except for the fact that the costumes/background effectively evoked the era, and that they convinced two fine actors to waste their time with this mess.Do not go down Revolutionary Road. It is a disaster.",2,2,2,23 January 2016
Gone Girl," Entertaining psycho-thriller
","Gone Girl keeps you guessing for a while about one thing - did he do it - and then keeps you guessing for a while about another thing. It's hard to talk about the plot without giving away spoilers.The story describes the complex relationship of two writers who meet, get together, then move from a big city to a less big place. You are left guessing what each one is thinking and doing, and why. Affleck does a good job as Nick Dunne, the good looking down-on-his-luck guy. He loves his wife, or does he? His wife loves him, or does she? Then she is Gone, one day, like that, and you ask - what happened.Rosamund Pike is terrific as the wife, Amy Dunne, a talented author with a complex mind, and complex past with her parents. Her acting is spectacular throughout. I remember her from the Bond film - Miranda Frost - and here she delivers too.Affleck's movie sister - Margo - who plays his twin, is equally fantastic and emotional throughout. It's the acting that makes this a very good movie. The story itself is a bit simple once you see what is happening. Then it moves to a cat and mouse game, and the finish where you sit there and think, humh, OK, that's one way to end this. My only con is there are sexual scenes that I think were pushed a bit too much into the graphics - a bit more subtlety might have improved this movie.See this movie if you like thrillers that keep you guessing till the end. Enjoy.",7,1,3,24 May 2015
2012," Good CGI, but not much of a story
","I remember when this movie came out how all the kids were lined up to see it before the world ended. Kids, nothing will stop Hollywood from making B-grade movies while you will pay for them, and that is what you have in 2012.The world is going to end, but fortunately, John Cusack knows how to save the day as a chauffeur for this rick Russian businessman. The special effects are everywhere as suddenly the world is exploding and these guys stay one step ahead.Put your reality hat in the closet for this one guys, which is pretty much what you should have expected going in. At the end of the day, if you want a movie with no real plot, stupid banter, sub-par acting, and good CGI, well, you have come to the right place. I watched this twice now, so I guess it's not terrible, but rather, an mindless way to spend 2 hours of your time without engaging your brain much. Enjoy.",5,1,4,4 September 2015
The Mist," Hate it when they change the ending!
","I recently read the novel so I thought I'd take a chance and watch the film. IMDb gave it a decent rating as did Netflix. The movie moved along nicely, with suspense about this mist, the quirky neighbor, the father-son relationship, etc. When the entities in the mist started doing their thing, I found that very well done. Little by little the director revealed what the poor people were dealing with. And when they ventured into the drug store next door, wow, now that was scary. Everything was moving along nicely, with the crazy church lady taking control over the group slowly but surely. But then, poof, the ending fell flat. Spoiler alert. Why why why did the director change the ending? In the novel, as I recall, no one committed suicide. There was the faint hope of heading towards Hartford because of something the father heard on the radio. But in the movie. 4 people commit suicide, including the father killing his own son? How does the director justify this, when all these people had done for the entire movie was fight for themselves, then at the end, they stop? They kill themselves 5 minutes after running out of gas? Didn't make sense. The ending sucked. The ending spoiled the whole movie for me. The ending destroyed all hope you had, when that was NOT the intent at all in the novel. Hence, my 5/10. I hate it when they change the ending!",5,1,3,26 April 2011
The Bourne Legacy," Decent film - don't believe the naysayers
","You should really just forget the Bourne titles and decide for yourself if you like a film. I read multiple reviews whining that the other film was better. That's unfair because you are comparing Bourne against a non-Bourne character. Of course it's going to be different. Get over it.Jeremy Renner delivers a decent effort here as Aaron Cross. Apparently he has some souped up power. During the story, there is a connection established between Bourne and Cross, but it's somewhat vague. Are they trying to say that Bourne had souped up powers too? No way, that was never Bourne. Which again tells you, forget about what the great Robert Ludlum wrote. These guys can do what they want with Bourne in film now. Just go with it. They change anything - beginnings/endings/origins. See Iron Man for example.I thought Rachel Weitz was OK, not terrific, but OK. There's one scene in her home where I thought she delivered terrific acting. The person that under-delivered was Edward Norton as the CIA/govt bad guy. I can never picture him as a bad bad guy, so I really think he was miscast. He can't deliver the bad guy vibe like Ed Harris can, or that other guy who plays the bad guy in the X-men films. Norton does not deliver - he does not exude the cut-your-tongue-out badness that his character theoretically has.I do think, like many reviewers write, that the story lacks punch, but is over 2 hours long, so something failed here. Not much happens, and then the final chase scene goes on pretty long. It's disappointing that the film has good acting, decent length, but lacks power.This movie won't blow you away, but does give you hope that there could be a sequel with Bourne. Anything is possible. Enjoy.",6,1,5,5 August 2014
Hidden Figures," Inspirational feel-good movie
","Hidden Figures is a very good film that depicts the story of three computers who happen to be young black women in the racially charged early 1960's. The computers calculated all of the math required to compete against the Russians in the race to space.The three stars are a super mathematician, an engineer, and a supervisor. Each woman is facing a battle against an immovable object - misogyny, racial prejudice, and a good-old boys network. Taraji Henson is terrific as Kathryn, the mathematical genius. She was outstanding, especially in one scene where she loses it to decry the silent injustices that she's had to deal with at NASA. Kevin Costner plays her crusty boss, the program leader Al, who slowly but surely starts realizing that things need to change if NASA is going to really work like a team, leverage all skills, and succeed.Janelle Monae is Mary, who dreams of being an engineer, but there are no women engineers, much less black women. She too has a mentor who sees her grit and skills, and works to support her efforts.My favorite though was Octavia Spencer as Dorothy, a programmer genius who is the true leader, and she knows it. She dreams of being a supervisor, yet she keeps running into racial prejudice from a white woman supervisor who does not even seem to realize her actions.The story is sometimes a bit uneven. There's a long love interest story going on for Kathryn. There's John Glenn's story too, and Grisham. Sometimes it seems like there was just a bit too much being crammed into the story. In the end, the dramatic finish leaves you hoping that things work out for everyone. Just enough suspense and you have a nicely wrapped up feel good movie. You should enjoy Hidden Figures.",7,1,3,7 May 2017
Lincoln," Strong acting but a bit slow
","The movie Lincoln demonstrates some superb acting all around. The movie portrays the few months before the end of the civil war and Lincoln's efforts to abolish slavery.It's a hard film for modern folks to watch because of the speed with which stuff happens. Lincoln spends time talking to his cabinet, to people, to soldiers, to politicians, to his kids. The movie demonstrates his unique political skills, and his efforts to abolish slavery at all costs. But all that movies along a bit slowly, compared to the internet speed pace of today.Daniel Day Lewis is fantastic as Lincoln. His voice, cadence, mannerisms, walk, and look really put you in Lincoln's shoes. Sally Field delivers a strong performance as his wife who really gives him back all he can take. My favorite though was James Spader, who assists in getting votes for Lincoln's initiatives. He is a hoot to watch. On the other hand, I did not enjoy Tommy Lee Jones, who seemed a bit over the top as a major liberal within the Republican party.The costumes and scenery were also very realistic, adding to the mood perfectly. If not for the pace, and the somewhat inevitable Hollywood ending, I would have enjoyed this movie even more. Still, it's a strong film with superb acting and a terrific cast. Enjoy.",7,0,2,25 March 2015
The Imitation Game," Terrific story
","This is a wonderful movie that pulls you in many different emotional ways. Benedict Cumberpatch is terrific as Alan Turing, the genius behind Britain's efforts to crack an unbreakable German encoder called Enigma.The movie flashes back between the early 1950s to the late 1930s. Turing is a mathematical genius. He gets recruited by the British government to lead a decoding team. However, he is terrible with people - preferring to be alone, yet needing help to work on the project.Enter Keira Knightly as Joan Collins (think that was her name). She demonstrates her math skills too, and Turing starts breaking out of his shell and interacts with people much better. There is a great cat-and-mouse game between various levels of the British govt, which was fascinating to learn about. There was also various games played within his team, and these add to the drama as they are revealed.In the end, I found it very sad to learn that the British govt was as stuffy as they were. Their position caused tragedy upon tragedy to people that should have been honored as incredible heroes.See this film - you will really enjoy the storyline and the acting. Enjoy.",8,1,2,19 May 2015
8 Mile," Worthy effort by Eminem saves simple story
","My teenage son suggested we rent 8 Mile because he has been listening to a lot of Eminem's rap music lately. The story is pretty simple really. These rappers in downtrodden Detroit look to rap as a way to get a record deal and escape the hopelessness they experience daily.If they work, they work in manual labor plants making car parts, or drink, or fight, or hang out. Eminem is the hope whose coattails these good guys hang to. They have a beef with the Free World rappers, not sure why. They act like Eminem is the only white guy they ever saw. You could look at this as Rocky, or as Karate Kid, where the leader is looking to get out and better himself while there are forces trying to hold him back..Eminem's mom, played by Kim Basinger, gives a decent portrayal as his down and out mom living in a trailer park, shacking up with some going nowhere dude who is obviously just using her. Eminem's posse is pretty interesting, and they have his back always. They get into trouble and do stuff, and people promise stuff that turns out to be smoke/mirrors. It's all leading up to the climatic final rap battle at The Shelter.Eminem does a pretty good acting job as Rabbit. My son thinks that the young girl theme follows his music, so there may be some reality behind the young Hailey who lives with his mom in the trailer. Finally Brittany Murphy is the shining star, acting wise. With her impish look, floused up hair, red lipstick, and cheap talk, she oozes sex appeal, and Eminem succumbs. She teaches him a lesson or two about honesty and how to make it in a tough world, and boy does he learn.Overall, a better than average film that gives you a stark view of the poverty of Detroit, and the lives of the 3-1-3 people of D. Enjoy.p.s. You should watch the Special Features Rap Battle segment which shows a really cool rap battle put on by the production team with the extras. good stuff.",Null,0,0,13 July 2014
Jurassic World," Satisfying but Same Old Same Old - just different cast
","I went into this film not expecting anything new, and my expectations were met. The film depicts the Isla Nubar 30 years or so after the original Jurassic Park fiasco. The difference is that Jurassic World is bigger, hugely popular, with many more genetically-mixed dinosaurs.The cast stars some young actors as the kids, not sure who they are - their acting extended as far as being scared. But Bryce Dallas Howard (Girl in the Water; The Village) was outstanding as Claire, the aunt who runs Jurassic World, and has thrust upon her these two nephews for whom she has no time - busy working single lady. Of course, enter Chris Pratt as Owen, semi-mysterious Dinosaur trainer with special skills to direct the Raptors (you remember them from the original). The movie was worth watching just to see these two interact with each other. They were the stars.The other major stars are the dinosaurs, or the CGI people who did a fantastic job putting all these dinosaurs into almost every scene. Tremendously life-like depictions really are the star of the show.I hope/trust you are not going to this movie for the story line. Shocker - something big gets out - things go wrong - people get stomped on and killed. Can't someone save the day?Of course, because Bryce is already signed up for a sequel. Although you know the story, and it's pretty much a repeat of the original series, the two main stars pull off a tough job and keeping you on your seat with some innovative chase scenes I have not seen before.All told, a satisfying story, kind of like putting on those well worn shoes you have, which feel so comfortable and familiar. Enjoy.",7,10,23,12 December 2015
Mission: Impossible II," Impossible to watch
","The worst of the MI series by far. Apart from the opening scene, the rest of the flick is a yawner. No mystery, no intrigue, no real action. Just terrible.Director Woo went to town on extended slow-mo close-ups of Tom Cruise and his girl played by Thandie Newton. OMG, if I see another close-up zoom to her nose I'm going to get sick. The support team really sucked too. They gave old reliable Ving Rhames nothing to do, and who the heck with this Simon Pegg lookalike who just laughed and did nothing?The final scene of an extended car crash with stuff blowing up all over and motorcycle after motorcycle really let you know that there was no plot in this movie, so the director decided to blow things up all over.It didn't work. It's impossible to like this flick. Cruise smiled too much, did his modicum of fighting, flexed his younger muscles, but the flick still fell flat. For much better MI, see 3 or shoot, any other, even 1. Skip this mess - not worth it.",2,2,5,18 June 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," No real story plot here
","I was disappointed with Avengers: Age of Ultron. There is no real story here. The trailers pretty much reveal all you need to know. Stark does something wrong, the AI Ultron comes to life, and he fights the Avengers. He fights them here, there, everywhere. He enlists help too. Ho hum. The fighting went on and on and on. There is an attempted plot line with Natasha and Banner, and a plot line with Hawkeye, and a small one with Thor, but really, nothing here to get excited about.I guess the word is - boring. Despite all the fighting, this film is just boring. You keep waiting for something to happen. when something does happen at the end, I don't know, I wasn't worried. This is Hollywood after all - they have a franchise to keep going. So do you ever think the Avengers will lose? That knowledge alone makes all this fighting moot because you know who will win. The actors I think are starting to get either bored themselves, or jumping ship. No Gweneth Paltrow, no Happy Hogan. Hawkeye has a message too. Seems like Chris Evans is starting to get too old for his youthful Cap. And we thought we'd seen the end of Iron Man, yet here he was again.At the end in Credits, you learn, oh, here's that guy, so the future portends yet another Avengers movie. Please give this one a plot with a real story where you don't know what is going to happen. That would possibly re-energize the actors and the customers because this one just was average at best.",6,4,11,19 October 2015
Everest," realistic, moving climbing movie
","I have read Into Thin Air, by John Krakauer, which details this entire fateful ascent of Mt Everest, the tallest mountain on earth. When I saw the Krakauer character in this movie, I realized this was a movie that would be tough to watch. Lots of stars, beautiful cinematography, and realistic characters all combine to make this a worthwhile film. I agree with others that sometimes things moved slowly. But a lot of the time is spent acclimatizing to high altitudes. Plus climbing at that altitude is a struggle. Living at that altitude is a struggle. I think you get the general gist of the characters. Rob Hall as owner is responsible for everyone's life. Scott from the other team is a big time risk taker, but not as organized as Hall. And the climbers, well, they are all serious, knowing they entrust their lives to this team.Things eventually go sideways, and even though you've prepared for everything, when you go against the rules on this mountain, you pay a price. Their are some heroic and some very tragic moments, all played gracefully and courageously by this troupe.See this movie, and you will appreciate your comforts much more. I also suggest you read Into Thin Air. Enjoy.",7,0,1,12 December 2016
Elysium," Matt Damon rescues somewhat contrived plot
","I rate this b-grade movie 6/10 only because of Matt Damon's excellent, powerful performance. Otherwise, the acting - nada, the plot - nada. This was terrible acting by Jodie Foster. What accent was she trying for anyway? French, Fringlish? And paper thin believability. Just disappointing for someone of her pedigree. Pure money grab. Sad.This movie tried to combine too much. It references the Mad Max genre, even naming Matt's character - Max. It references Forest Gump with Frey and Max forming this bond when they were young, like Forest and Jenny. I could have lived with those links, but the plot had too many holes to keep this ship afloat.People on earth have to stare up at this star-shaped Elysium floating above them, where everyone is happy and healthy and wealthy. Yes, they have medical pods that can cure every disease, but only the rich inhabitants of Elysium have access to them. Of course, bands of earthlings try to get up there, like the illegal immigrants trying to seek out a better life, and Jodie Foster shoots them down with no second thought. I get it, the rich kill the poor. The rich live the good life, the poor suffer in squalor. Boy does this movie hit you over the head repeatedly with that theme. By the time you leave the theater, I get the feeling the producers wanted you to feel guilty for even having enough money to pay for the tickets to see this mess.When Max faces the evil bad guy Kruger at the end, wow, what a surprise, huh? Good wins over evil. And when Max makes the ultimate sacrifice to free the slaves of earth, everyone is supposed to cheer, a la Armageddon with Bruce Willis. Send down the medical pods.Cure all 10 billion people on earth...eh...wait, Elysium can't hold 10 billion people, oh well, you can vacation up here, then go back to your poverty and pollution. Yeah, earth rebels never thought through the consequences of liberating your planet.Yeah, well, you instead should think of the consequence to your sanity of watching this mish mosh that tried to do too much. If you like Matt Damon, this will be worth your while for his effort. Otherwise, I'd suggest you beam me up Scotty, and get me out of here!",6,0,1,7 April 2014
La La Land," Wonderful, refreshing
","They really don't make movies like this anymore. La La Land really should have won Best Picture Oscar. Ryan Gosling was terrific as Seb, the down on his luck jazz pianist who didn't want to see his treasured music die. Emma Stone was equally terrific as the stereotypical young woman in Hollywood trying to catch that one in a million break.This movie was great because it was refreshing to see Hollywood make fun of itself. Emma's character Mia was a jab at the shallowness of the Hollywood scene where interview after interview ignore her after a sentence of two. See Penny in the TV show Big Bang Theory for another jab at Hollywood. But Mia keeps trying, to her credit. When she meets Seb in an on-again off-again relationship, it's fun to watch. The dancing and music scenes are terrific, especially the opening famous scene played out on an LA freeway - wouldn't anyone in a big traffic jam love to have that entertainment?But there's a story here too, and it's very well told. Don't ever give up on your dreams. Are your dreams worth sacrificing for love? What happens if you move on? Can't both people in a relationship live their dreams? Oh, the sadness and joy of success.La La Land is a fantastic movie that you should not miss. You'll laugh, cry, and sing the songs for days and days. Enjoy.",8,1,3,18 June 2017
The Hurricane," Powerful, thought-provoking drama.
","Denzel Washington stars as Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, an up and coming African-American boxer who lived in Paterson, New Jersey. Director Norman Jewison delivers a powerful drama that kicks you in the guts multiple times, making you empathize with the injustice of Carter's incarceration on false charges of murder.Carter was no saint mind you. The film walks you through his youth and encounters with a certain detective Della Pesca. Carter grew up in the 1960s in a time of extreme racial prejudice, which comes through in all aspects of the story. Although this film is based on a true story, the director advises us that some characters have been made up and some activities have been fictionalized for the story. Therefore, you are not sure what is close to reality, and what is Hollywood fiction.The story focuses on the efforts of a young kid from Brooklyn, Lesra, played very well by Vicellous Reon Shannon, to become friends with and eventually help Carter get justice. Lesra is helped by three Canadians who take him under their wings to help him. There always underlies suspicion about their motives, but the film makes it seem they simply saw this boy had potential and needed some assistance to reach it.The film weaves you through the murder, the trial, the imprisonment, and efforts to appeal. The process drags on, for years, giving my only critique that perhaps the film could have been shorter. The anguish though, is palpable, similar to 12 Years a Slave, without the blood.Denzel Washington is simply terrific, and won the Golden Globe Best Actor for his portrayal. He delivered so many emotions in this role, particularly during his first visit to solitary confinement where he has a battle, with himself, to basically retain his sanity, and later, his dignity. Why he did not win the Osacar, I'm not sure.The ending will grip you, as they risk all in a life or death fight for justice. Watch for a short but important role by all-time-great, Rod Steiger, perfectly cast by the way.At almost 2 1/2 hours, the movie runs long, but it keeps moving. There is a fine interweaving of music, particularly the song Bob Dylan wrote about the Hurricane. This is a must-see film about race, prejudice, redemption, and justice that will stay with you.

Sicario," Disappointing plot with unfulfilling story
","I expected more from Sicario, but was disappointed with both the plot and the fairly empty, shallow story.I also think Emily Blount was miscast as Kate, the FBI agent who handles kidnappings until she's suddenly recruited to join a Govt anti-drug task force. Enter Josh Brolin as the Govt agent. He was excellent as one of these mysterious Govt types that works for some agency with some kind of authority from somewhere.But Benicio Del Toro is the star. He turns in a terrific performance as this ultra mysterious Spanish-speaker who has some TBD role helping the US Govt fight against Mexican drug lords. Kate is supposedly this tough FBI agent, but she seems to bristle at the Govt agents methods, thinking that the law is supposed to be followed. But these guys don't. Really though, drug lords, Mexico, what did she expect? I kept thinking that if she was this righteous, she should not have volunteered. There are some nice back and forth scenes between Blount and Del Toro as he coaches her on how to absorb what she sees, and well as with Brolin.But the story suffers because we never learn more about Kate or any of these guys. It would have really helped to learn about Kate's upbringing to more understand he motivation to fight drugs so much. But instead, it's empty. So when she starts bristling, you are left wondering why.The story gets a bit bogged down with she and her partner smoking cigarettes, and going back and forth to this hotel to meet the teams. It's like, OK, what is the point here? The story also gets a bit hard to figure out what is happening.The whole movie is pretty bloody and violent, as you'd expect. But it's not a great film by any means. The ending culminates in your learning more, but I'm like, so what, big deal. Average at best is Sicario. Some great stuff from Del Toro, but otherwise, just average. Enjoy.",6,3,7,12 March 2016
Hoosiers," Inspiring David vs Goliath sports story and more
","Hoosiers is one of the best high school sports films ever made. Made me think of Bobby Knight because the story follows a washed up coach Norman Dale (Hackman) who gets one last chance to coach because of a personal friendship with the principal at Hickory HS. Like Knight, Hackman lost his job because of anger problems. He comes to Hickory to seek redemption.Hoosiers excels at so many levels. The cinematography is beautiful and breathtaking, capturing the local community and nature with wonderful shots of being alone in mid America. Hackman also gets isolated when he lets the locals know in no uncertain terms that HE is the coach, not them, and that they better let him be. Hackman delivers a masterful performance with his smiles and easygoing yet tough exterior. He uses charm to get his way, but he uses his tough character to teach the boys that he's serious about coaching them to be great.Barbara Hershey's character is more complex. A local who left and came back. She seems stuck in the mud, at time literally, in this little community, this little school of 84 kids. Never going anywhere. Makes you kind of think of George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life. Hershey is not as good an actor as Hackman by any stretch, and she had trouble keeping up with him. Also, the screenplay with their relationship left me wondering if that part made any sense. Hackman guides the team with help from a recovering drunk played wonderfully by a young Dennis Hopper as Scooter. He's terrific, and offers another challenge for Hackman to overcome, especially because his son is one of the stars on the team.The team improves when Jimmy rejoins the team after a personal tragedy. He's a star and immediately lifts the entire town. They fight and claw and battle and give it their all. Can they go as far as they are challenged to go?Like MacFarland or Friday Night Lights or other sports comeback flicks, this one will leave you cheering. I think the end could have been a bit longer and more played out. Plus the Hershey/Hackman relationship could have been revised a bit. Otherwise - great film. A classic basketball film that will have you cheering. Enjoy.",8,2,2,22 May 2017
"McFarland, USA"," Nice clean, entertaining flick
","I enjoyed McFarland USA. This Disney film follows a standard, entertaining Disney script. The acting is strong throughout, led by good old Kevin Costner, who at 60 yrs old, they turned into a 40-something guy - successfully. Maria Bello provided strong support as his wife. The young Mexican actors were pretty good too, especially Carlos Pratts as Tomas Valles, the team's lead runner.Costner plays Jim White, a football coach who loses his job after he loses his coaching cool with student athletes, and ends up having to take a job at McFarland High School in southern California. Culture shock galore as his white family of 4 finds themselves the minorities in this predominantly Mexican immigrant town.White and family slowly adjust to the new environment. The football team he was supposed to coach stinks, and he proposes a cross country team because he sees these kids running fast and far.The rest you can imagine, again, as a typical Disney film. How far can these kids go, how fast, can they hope to break the cycle of unbelievable poverty of migrant pickers. The depiction of the kids' lives is palpable - unbelievably hard-working kids, which forms the basis for their toughness.Costner plays the role like a silk coat, sliding right in to the familiar good-guy role who is going to overcome all odds to be successful - see Field of Dreams. I like him much better in these types of roles as opposed to evil CIA-type killers. Leave those roles to others please.The film has some minor sub plots, and gives a nice flavor for what the Mexican culture brings to our USA. You will of course cheer and cry at the end. All told, a nice, tidy, entertaining film that will make you feel good, and upbeat, and hopeful.",7,0,0,21 November 2015
War of the Worlds," OK remake
","Tom Cruise stars as Ray, a dock worker in NYC who is divorced from his wife and has 2 kids, Rachel (Dakota Fanning) and Robbie (Justin Chatwin). Ray gets custody of the kids over the weekend while his ex and her husband are off to Boston. Then out of nowhere, the aliens start attacking. Cruise does a decent acting job. I found Dakota Fanning great, though her role was limited to mostly crying, screaming, and looking scared, which she did very well. Robbie is depicted as a son who thinks his father let them down and doesn't care about the kids, which seems to be mostly right. Cruise is playing a complex role trying to show the kids he can be caring, while realizing he's been somewhat of an irresponsible dad to them too. The movie is all about CGI after that. Endless chases across the landscape, unruly mobs, and the tripod monster ships. The movie gets kind of tedious and slow, especially when they hide out in a basement with Tim Robbins. Spielberg tries to keep up the tension as much as possible, and that mostly succeeds.Still, you already know the story. So you know how it's going to go. Therefore, really not much of a plot, little room for the characters to grow much, with an interesting twist around blood. It was an OK movie, so I give it an OK score 6/10. Cruise has been better, and so has Spielberg. Even the animators in the special features, while trying to make it seem like they were excited, also seemed to be going thru the motions while paying appropriate tribute to Spielberg. That pretty much summed up this OK movie.",6,2,4,15 March 2015
12 Years a Slave," Bludgeoning drama
","12 Years a Slave tells a tragic story of a Free black man, Solomon Northrup, from upstate NY with a family and musical talent. On a trip to Washington DC, he gets kidnapped by slave traders and dragged into slavery.Americans know the sad history of slavery in the US. This film slaps you in the face with visceral storytelling of the brutality and abuse of slavery, both mental and physical. Some made it, mostly by keeping quiet and acting like docile pets to cruel masters. Others did not.You will see images of terrible lashings, whips, chains, sexual destruction, hangings, the whole thing. Over and over, this misery bludgeons you into hopelessness. While I'm sure the director expressed all this misery repeatedly to wear the viewer down, after 2 hrs 14 minutes, I had had enough - I got the point. There were too many long scenes, and repeated scenes like the dancing, and the abuse of the poor attractive black girl, and of Northrup himself of course. Maybe that is what the director intended, and if so, he did a terrific job. This movie is not for the faint of heart. If you want an in-your- face reality check on just what slavery was, and perhaps why still today there is a growing animosity from blacks against whites, see 12 Years a Slave. It's not a masterpiece, and I'm sure it was a difficult film for the actors to make, but it is a story that bears your seeing to experience this horrible piece of history that we hope never happens again.Terrific acting throughout, with my major critique being the length. Enjoy.",7,1,2,5 September 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Pure junk, just like what these guys sold!
","How IMDb ends up rating this 8+ would make a better story than this piece of junk. Scorcese should be ashamed to release this trash. did this really run 3 hours? I wouldn't know because I kept walking way, then coming back, and the same crap was going on, different locale. Sex and drugs and money. Really, did we need that for 3 hours to get the point that these a-holes were low life scum that scammed millions and loved it? No. we didn't need that. I ended up ejecting it after I don't remember how many scenes of masturbation and peeing into waste baskets and similar ridiculous excuses for movie making. Scorcese - this movie sucked. The only reason I have it two stars was because the actors did a good job portraying their characters. But the director, screenplay writers, and the producers let this one get way out of control.Skip this piece of junk. It stinks!",2,8,12,24 June 2015
Defiance," Solid film
","During WW2, the Bielski family led a group of Russian Jews into the woods in an effort to save as many people as possible. Daniel Craig is excellent as the leader Tuvia, who is maybe not smart, but is street wise and tough. His brother Zus, played by Liv Schreiber, is bigger, tougher, but more of a joker. He's also more of a pure fighter. There are 2 other Bielski younger sons as well.The movie constantly keeps you guessing what will happen next - will the Germans find them. If they find them, what happens. How can so many people survive with no food or shelter. The theme of the movie is to show you that some Jews fought back and did not passively go to their deaths. You can feel the anger of how many deaths they had to deal with when they get their hands on Germans. There is a love interest or two, but those seem to play minor roles. It's mostly all about survival, and brother vs brother, and how the whole Bielski family handles the issues. You should check out the special features interviews with relatives of the real people. Makes you realize that perhaps your troubles pale in comparison to what the survivors had to endure.Defiance is well acted, captivating, and well choreographed. Don't miss this terrific movie. Enjoy.",7,2,4,19 May 2015
Arrival," Thoughtful and moving
","Arrival is a thought-provoking science fiction movie. The plot revolves around alien ships that look like eggs that appear over 12 countries and open themselves for interaction with each country. Amy Adams is the linguistic professor who teams up with a physicist played by Jeremy Renner to try to communicate with the ship that hovers over America.The Director Villeneuve builds tension using pressure between the countries, each trying to break through and find out why the aliens are here. There are very clever usages of time-like flashbacks that give some clues, but what does it mean? There was excellent chemistry between Adams and Renner. Forest Whitaker plays the Colonel in charge and he does an OK job. The most interesting part is how each race learns to communicate with each other. The scenes inside the egg ship are really well done from a CGI and story viewpoint. This movie will keep you guessing until the end, and even then, you might be left wondering if you got everything. And if you like those kinds of movies, this one will touch you deeply from the human standpoint. Director Villeneuve also made Enemy and Prisoners - I recommend both highly. I also recommend Arrival as an excellent example of a movie where plot and acting skills are so key to the success and your experience. Enjoy Arrival!",8,1,5,20 February 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," So-so Angst-driven film with decent acting but failed plot
","Birdman reminds me so much of other supposedly great artistic movies that won Best Picture Oscars, yet were never embraced by fans. For example, Big Boys Don't Cry was touted by critics as so great, yet I think it stunk. I guess I'm not artistic enough to appreciate the depth of the director's masterpiece. Or Leaving Las Vegas, where Cage won an Oscar - another boring tedious film.Enter Birdman. The story revolves around an aging Hollywood movie actor Riggan (Michael Keaton) who has tired of playing a superhero Birdman (obvious play on the Batman series) and decides to direct and star in a play on Broadway to prove that he really can act, not just put on a Birdman suit. The cast of characters is interesting - his daughter played by Emma Stone. His agent/confidant/lawyer played by ZachG. But his biggest friend/foe is Edward Norton, who plays this supposedly great actor who decides to step in and save the day when the play is in its final preparation and the lead actor is discovered to be talentless.Michael Keaton delivers, kind of like Mickey Rourke did in The Wrestler. He delivers great emotion and depth of character. He deserved best acting awards/nominations. Norton delivered an obnoxious spoiled brat who was used to getting what he wanted, in all aspects of his life. Overall, strong acting from the leads.But the story inevitably fails because it leaned too heavily on sex, drugs, and meaningless banter and open-ended sub-plots that just dragged it down. At one point, it reminded me of the disgusting Wolf of Wall Street with pointless sexual innuendos. I guess the director was trying to show how many different ways Keaton's character was being abused and pulled. But it left me exasperated when I wanted to get to the point and see if he could succeed or not on Broadway.After preparing for weeks, he is ready of the real opening night. The famous ending leaves me scratching my head. I googled explanations of the ending, and found one that said there were three different interpretations I could have. That's when I decided this movie was 5/10. If I can 'imagine' three different meanings of the ending, the movie failed. This was just too much of an artistic leap for me. I saw a movie, The Enemy, where there was a confusing ending, but then I read the explanation, and there was ONE clear explanation that clarified the whole movie. I said - Oh - that's cool! I get it. Not with Birdman. For me, it was great acting from mostly Keaton, a tiring screenplay, and a confusing ending. That is my take, but you be the judge. Enjoy your flight if you so choose.",5,4,7,25 December 2015
Platoon," Exciting war film from start to end
","Platoon is one of my favorite war films, right up there with Paths of Glory. A young Charlie Sheen plays a new soldier who volunteered to fight in Vietnam. This film traces his journey, along with his platoon, over months of fighting.The action seems realistic, the cinematography seems realistic, the cast are excellent, especially Tom Berenger (Barnes) and Wilem Dafoe (Elias) who are battling each other while they battle for the hearts and souls of the squad. Meanwhile, they need to get the squad functional enough to battle the North Vietnamese Army NVA.Incredible action, highs and lows, while Sheen does a decent job of portraying his moth-like change from a newbie to a hardened warrior. The music adds soulful feeling to the powerful fighting scenes and recovery. It's like they fight, recover, and are thrown back in again for more and more. The film wears you down, as you can imagine the men being worn down at the same time. You will experience this movie like few other war films.Great film that the Academy rewarded with a well-deserved Best Picture and Director. Enjoy.",9,3,4,20 June 2014
The Silence of the Lambs," One of the best murder mystery thrillers you will ever see
","I first saw Silence when it came out in late 1991. A friend and I saw it, and left the theater stunned. It was the first time I have ever had trouble sleeping after watching a movie, so impactful was the content.Silence is flawless in all aspects. Casting, screenplay/plot, direction, cinematography, and editing are superb. By now, we are all familiar with Dr Lector (Anthony Hopkins), the deranged, brilliant psychologist who does battle with the forces of good, here represented by the FBI's Clarice Starling (Jody Foster. Perhaps her last great role). Hopkin's performance is a tour de force of acting. He uses words like knives to stab at Clarice, exposing her checkered past, extracting information that he stores to dig into her later on. And Clarice, a young FBI agent with strong experience in psychology, is clearly overmatched by Dr Lector. They play a back and forth cat and mouse game that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.Excellent casting includes the sanitarium head, Dr Chilton (Anthony Heald) who plays this sleazy Head who covets having Dr Lector as his prize while clumsily trying to snag a date with Clarice. Scott Glenn portrays Dr Crawford, Clarice's boss whom she looks up to. He has his own demons he's dealing with that are never fully revealed, and the father-mentor interaction between him and Clarice is palpable. Finally, there's the other evil force, excellently played by Ted Levine.There is a significant amount of killing, and some very viscerally evil scenes that are not for the squeamish. You will be moved, so if you are not good with strong physical scenes, you may want to close your eyes a lot. But you must see this film. The final piece is the editing and directing, which weaves every scene together so it all adds up and makes sense at the end, kind of like in Forest Gump, but with evil intent, not kindness.This film was one of those rare gems that even the Oscars got right by awarding it the triple crown of Oscars - Best picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress. It also won best screenplay. If you have not seen this movie, it's a must-see that you should put on your list. Make sure you are prepared for the darkness of evil portrayed so brilliantly in the Silence of the Lambs. Enjoy.",10,4,8,19 June 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Better than we are led to think by critics
","Batman v Superman is better than the bashing of critics led you to believe. There is not much depth of acting to be had as Bat and Supe both snarl appropriately at all the right times. That's about it from them for acting.Affleck does a decent job portraying with angst Bruce Wayne/Batman and his lifelong sorrow over his parents' deaths. But i kept wondering why this particular killing sent him over the edge to battle someone he obviously could not defeat. There are lots of fights and things get smashed, mostly due to the savory Lex Luthor. I hated how Zuckerberg portrayed Luthor as a complete a-hole, with silly babbling and crazy actions. Bad direction IMHO. Luthor is the low light of this film.Gal Gadot saves the movie as the new Wonder Woman. She was absolutely great, and makes you want to see more of her skills in the next installment. She is really a graceful-looking actress with pretty good acting skills. Reminds me of Audrey Hepburn in her youth. The plot line moves along to the climax, which I wasn't expecting. Guess I didn't watch enough trailers. Lois Lane is somewhat annoying along the way, and Perry White is pretty non-existent here. The whole Superman side leaves you shaking your head about how someone who is supposedly so smart could be so dumb. Still in all, I found enough drama and action to keep me guessing about how this V thing would play out, and it surprised me enough to give this a 7/10. It's better than average, and better than critics said. Enjoy.",7,0,3,17 September 2016
Lucy," Gruesome and Torrid Pace that Falls Flat
","This movie has a lot of movement for most of the story. But suddenly, the end just falls flat. It doesn't totally, but the ending in no way measures up to how you got there.Scarlett/Lucy is a nobody in Taiwan with a loser boyfriend. She gets involved in this drug deal and next thing you know, the ride begins. This movie is ultra-fast paced, and seems to accelerate as Lucy's powers expand. There is a lot of blood and violence here, so be warned. The story is good, it keeps you guessing where this is going. The French policeman, Del Rio, is superb - he knows how to act, and how to let Lucy do her thing. Morgan Freeman plays the wise professor who is somewhat shocked to see his theories live before his eyes.There is a lot of killing and somewhat over the top bloodletting. Many chase scenes too, one of the best taking place in downtown Paris. Scarlett Johansson is terrific as Lucy. She has this look of, well, you don't know what I'm going to do next, but I know I'm capable of doing whatever I want. Kind of reminds me a bit of Uma Thurman in the Kill Bill series, without the swords.However, you are ramped up to reach the end, and then, splat. It falls flat. You could hear the audience sigh....that's it?? Yep, that's it. At 90 mins start to end, that's at least a tidy pace. But I think Besson could have taken the last 15 mins, shortened it to 5, and spent that extra time adding a bit more depth. Leaving a movie at the end with a --that's it?-- feeling is deflating.I still give it a 7/10 because for 95 percent of your time, you are glued to you seat. It's worth a look, but it really could have been better with a better, more well-thought-out ending. That's it...enjoy",7,2,11,27 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Nothing special except the old gang
","If you were expecting something different and better, you will be disappointed with SW7, Force Awakens.The plot seems pretty similar to the previous plots. This young girl Rey seems to have something special. Could she have special Jedi powers? Who is this guy Finn and why did he leave the troopers? It was comfortable to see Chewie and Hans Solo, like putting on a nice comfortable, well- work jacket. But there are chase scenes, and a bad guy who is eerily similar to Darth Vader, with again the father/son angle thrown in. Fighter jets attack a big bad warship. The computer robot has a special role. Does this all sound familiar? Oh, and at the end you are left hanging, knowing that the franchise will continue. Same old same old.Star Wars 7 was nothing special, except the hype, and seeing Harrison Ford again. Otherwise, I think this bridge to the next generation of SW fans might just be a bridge too far. Stick with the Star Trek movies - they are more enjoyable that this retread.",6,13,19,21 August 2016
Unbroken," Engrossing and heart rendering story of triumph
","Unbroken is the incredible true story of Louis Zamperini, directed by Angelina Jolie, from the book by Laura Hillenbrand. If you ever think you are enduring something, watch this movie, and your troubles will feel lighter.Zamperini was an Italian immigrant who grew up in California. He was not a perfect kid - he stole things, didn't follow the rules. But he learned toughness. He learned he had a special skill - running. He used that to excel in life and build strength.The video box tells you the whole story. He goes to the Olympics. He goes to war. He goes to a prison camp in Japan. But this guy, he had an inner strength that few of us on the planet have. He was like a superman. My favorite takeaway from that kitche movie Alaska was 'never give up' and boy does that apply here.Zamperini was brutalized mentally and physically during his imprisonment. But he stood tall. But to be able to endure that on top of his war experience, it's just amazing. He's an amazing person.Jolie does a fine job of weaving the key plots without hitting you over the head too much. I'm most impressed that the movie was only 2 hrs 18 mins. when less talented directors would have surely made this 3 hrs. Not that there wasn't plenty to tell. But she skillfully used flashbacks at the right times, all woven into a beautiful piece of film work.I now want to read the book, which apparently details yet more suffering he endured. See Unbroken. It's a must-see film. enjoy.",8,0,0,11 October 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Katniss is cool
","I've never read any of these books, but have now seen both Hunger Games films. Catching Fire was pretty good. Jennifer Lawrence does a fine acting job as Katniss. As does evil Donald Sutherland as the President. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the Gamemaker. Woody Harrelson turns in his quirky Haymus (sp) role. The films basic premise is that the victors from previous HG competitions now have to fight against each other because of some special 75th anniversary. That premise was kind of silly, bu whatever. As Peeta and Katniss get paraded around, revolution foments in all districts.I guess we will finally find out what happens in part 3, the Mockingjay, which is apparently going to be released as a Part 1 and Part 2, a la Harry Potter 7. They must milk out ever penny possible. That's about it. Not a lot more to say. I enjoyed this story, the acting, the colors, the fight scenes...all good stuff. Enjoy.",7,1,14,24 August 2014
Looper," Looper Fails to Excite
","I had high expectations of Looper, but ended up disappointed in the final product. The story falls flat and gets caught in its own repetitive loop, which drags it down the tubes.Joseph G-Levitt lives in the past, does drugs, and is a looper whose job is to kill people sent back from the future by mobsters. Apparently the bad guys cannot just kill someone in the future, so they grab them, send them back in time, illegally, and the looper kills them for silver. This guy is a loser who just goes around killing people with no soul or purpose or respect or really anything at all. He just does what he's told to do, sleepwalking through life, and getting paid for. His only marginal friend is not really a friend. He shows his social side by studying French, a useless throw-in that served no apparent purpose.How many times do we need to see this guy shoot somebody with his special gun? I didn't count the numbers, but enough already!! We get the point - he kills people. Kind of reminds me of 8 Mile, when the first few F-bombs have an impact, then you just get numb from overuse. Obviously, the plot didn't have enough depth, so the director used this tactic as a filler that added no value.Enter Bruce Willis, Levitt's older version from 30 years in the future. OK you think, now it's going to get interesting. Not really. Willis and Levitt had no real chemistry. Casting mistake here. You learn some stuff about Willis in the future, and you learn he's trying to preserve his future by controlling his past. OK, yep, we saw this in Terminator 1, 2, 3. Nothing new here.There are chase scenes, and killings, and an interesting Diner scene, but really, the story drags. I started using fast forward so I could get somewhere where something would happen. The final scene takes place on this farm which I think lasts a good 30 minutes, and brings in Emily Blunt. She does an OK acting job, but her role again lacks depth of character, so there's not much to work with. The ending, oh wow, what a surprise...not. Figure it out yourself, you don't have to be too imaginative.Boring plot, disappointing chemistry, ad nauseum killing, standard b-grade acting. I cannot recommend this film, despite the advertising you see. It's just a poor film all around. I recommend instead Source Code which plays on a time travel theme, without the killing, and a superb storyline with superior acting. Skip Looper - it stinks.",3,2,3,15 July 2014
Life," Lifeless
","Life was disappointing, even with my low expectations since I'd not seen this movie advertised in theatres at all. The only good thing about Life is that they knew it was not even a grade B film, so they edited it down to a short 1 hr 40 mins. The story is simple. Space station gets samples from Mars that turn out to be something dangerous. It's just like a horror film waiting for who gets killed next. This alien is another take on Alien's well-worn monster except they keep saying how smart it is. One by one, bad stuff happens.Meanwhile, the actors sleepwalk their way thru this mess. Jake Gyllenhaal must've know he was miscast as a scientist because he had zero believability, even in this one scene where he cried, it was terrible acting. All the crying scenes left me crying from how fake they were. Rebecca Ferguson from Mission Impossible was horrible too. Besides her fake crying, with horrible music, even her horror at the monster was just bad acting. The music was bad. Ominous black cloud music that didn't synch well with the scenes. Even the end had me laughing when the final song was Spirit in the sky, and I thought, what? Is this a 1970's Vietnam war movie? Bad stuff.The only breath of hope was Ryan Reynolds who was given his comfortable role of group comedian, just like he was as Deadpool. Unfortunately, his role ended up being minor. He might have helped save the day.Bad script, bad acting, bad music. Just bad. What this movie needed was a hero. Someone who was a military presence who was going to take it to the bad guy. but alas, there was no such character, which in a space station just amazed me. You can skip this disaster. I only give it a 4 for some mild intrigue, but once the action gets going, it goes downhill fast. This movie was lifeless. Suggest you skip or rent it for free from your library with expectations set to low.",4,4,8,10 September 2017
Deadpool," Campy fun flick - if you can take the blood and gore
","My teenage son encouraged me to watch Deadpool - theoretically an R- rated love story. Wow, what a different kind of film. Self-deprecating, witty, different, funny, all these apply to Deadpool. I guess you could loosely call it a love story. There are some sex scenes, and lots lots of blood and violence. The story constantly pokes fun at Marvel, Ryan, previous flics, future films, but mostly continually at itself. This self-humorous approach, roughly similar to Ant-Man, hits the mark. Deadpool is a pretty cool, innovative story. Ryan plays the role of Wade who eventually becomes Deadpool. The story pokes fun at him over and over, especially around his love for sex and his lover. The editor had a ball with stop action film sequences where Deadpool stops to tell us what is going to happen, pulling himself out of the scene, then diving back in. It works.The movie does slow down a bit in the middle - it was impossible to keep up the non-stop level of witty repartee that introduces the film, starting with the introductory credits - just watch - you'll understand.The end was somewhat predictable, good guy against bad guy. There also is the tie-in with X-men, so I expect that will continue. I understand there's already a Deadpool 2 en route, so buckle up for more fun.I loved Deadpool, and you will too, if you don't mind the blood/violence. Enjoy.",8,6,15,15 May 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Disappointing, miscast, predictable
","I did not like Kingsman Secret Service for a few reasons. First, they miscast Samuel L Jackson as the lead bad guy Mr Valentine. Second, he overplayed the character to such an outrageous degree that it just got sickening. Michael Caine was also miscast and misused. Need an old English guy who you think is good, or is he? Call Michael Caine who sleepwalked through this cash-grab role. Colin Firth was OK in his role, and his young apprentice Eggsy (silly name) was OK. Another reason to dislike this - the story was very predictable from start to end. there was no guessing about what was going to happen. Another reason to hate this film was the gore factor. There were so many frivolous blood shots and gore and hatchets and knives. It just went on and on till I just spaced out in disgust.I had high hopes for this flick. I expected a combination of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen with a James Bond flair, or even Sky Captain. But instead this ended up looking like a poor version of the Matrix mixed with the worst Bond film mixed with Commando. It just sucked.The only bright spot was the lady killer who has a unique way of making her point with adversaries, just like Top Hat used to slice off heads with his bowler hat. Other than that, and mild intrigue, this movie was poor. I cannot believe there is a sequel coming out this summer. Good luck with that - pretty sure the bar will be pretty low based on this first mess of a film. Don't waste your time on this film.",4,3,5,22 May 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Revenge is even sweeter in Chapter 2
","Keanu Reeves delivers a supercharged performance as the embattled ex-assassin, John Wick, who gets dragged back in to the world that he desperately wants to escape from. But a marker is a marker and Wick gets forced to pay back a debt he can't refuse. Then everything hits the fan.Even though Chapter 2 is pretty much the same as Chapter 1, this is an even better, amazing film. Wick kills more people than I've ever seen in one movie.Keanu is excellent as Wick, who is always cut up, tired, disshelved, wearing the weight of the world on his shoulders. Tired of everything, except living and killing. Laurence Fishburne is terrific as the bird man who kind of helps Wick out. The Continental Hotel is again central as a sanctuary - no business on the property - or is it? The hotel manager is again excellently played by Ian Mcshane. He has a terrific voice and is a superb actor. I love the role of the Reception Manager, played by Lance Reddick who you will recognize from the Bosch TV series on Amazon.Fast-paced is insufficient to describe the speed of the story, including a terrific chase scene to open the movie. You also get treated to a beautiful trip to Rome and the catacombs, with some wonderful cinematography. The bad guy is an Italian mobster younger guy, and you just can't wait for Wick to slap the entitlement out of his smug little face. Be patient - you may get that or not.Since there is now a Chapter 3 coming out this month May 2019, you know that Wick survives the onslaught in 2. How can they top this? I don't think they can, but if they can even equal it, that will be quite a feat.I can't wait to see Keanu slip into the dirty black suit jacket, with his dog, and his car, and give it his all to defeat the challengers. Will be fun.
For now, Chapter 2 is a big success. Not for the squeamish, but hey, if you like Wick films, you already know that.

Spectre," The Usual Bond
","This Bond was the usual stuff. Daniel Craig returns his usual low-key Bond who travels the world seeking the bad guys. In this trilogy-like wrap up, Bond gets a clue that leads him on a chase of the group Spectre. He learns of ties to his past. We learn that this group has multiple ties to the last few Bond films in various ways. There weren't too many Bond girls in this one. Lea Seydoux is a bit young for Bond, who's getting on a bit, but still delivers the rough physical Bond that Craig is known for. There are plane, train, and automobile chases. For an action thriller, I don't know, it's hard to get excited because it's all basically been done before. I think Ralph Fiennes makes a good M, but I want to learn more about him, like we did with Judi Dench. Skyfall revealed a lot about Bond. Spectre wanted to add to that, but in the end, just fizzled. Will Bond turn over a kinder, gentler leaf like the ending portends? Ha, I doubt it.So A for effort, but the plot in the end is so so. The best new character was Dave Bautista as the bad guy Mr Hinx, who stands toe to toe with Bond. Kind of recalls Top Hat and the Lurch character from earlier Bonds. I liked Spectre, but in the end, it was so so. Enjoy.",6,1,6,27 February 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Violent bloody war film
","Hacksaw Ridge is a very violent war film. Bodies are blown apart, knives are slicing people, and bullets or grenades are flying in close hand to hand combat.This movie directed by Mel Gibson portrays a true story of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield). Garfield seems to have escaped the trap of Spiderman with a few films this summer that stretch his acting skills. In Ridge, he works hard to portray a young man who is an honest, hard working religious person who wants to help his country in the battlefield of Japan but won't use a gun. He wants to be a medic. Doss is a generally happy kid despite an unpleasant home life due to his drunken father's aggressive behavior.The early part of the film shows Desmond when he's young, but I got a bit confused about who was who, and where they were flashing back or forward to. That part could have been better edited for clarity. Like most war films, there are so many guys that it's hard to remember who is who. Doss undergoes a titanic battle to get thru the Army's red tape to actually become a medic. Once deployed, the face Hacksaw Ridge, a huge 90 degree angle cliff several hundred feet tall leading up to the killing plateau. From there on out, the scenes are blood and violent. Can Doss withstand the pressure to not pick up a gun? Can he stay true to his word and serve God in these conditions? The story draws you in and leaves you amazed at this person's courage.Except for the confusing beginning, Gibson does a fine job getting good acting from all characters. At film's end, I felt somewhat drained from all the violence and horror of war, which I guess means that the film worked. Look for a fine performance by Hugo Weaving from Captain America and I think the Matrix series Mr smith. Weaving is outstanding as Doss's father who fought in WW1 and knows well what his son going off to war means. Fine film. Unbelievable story. Worth your time. Enjoy.",7,0,2,24 May 2017
Born on the Fourth of July," Cruise Control drives home the point
","I recently rewatched this film because of all the recent VA hospital mistreatment issues of vets. It really reminded me of how good this movie was, led by an awesome job by Cruise, and a powerful directing job and screenplay by Oliver Stone. The film portrays the real life story of Ron Kovic, whose life on Long Island thrives on religion, hard work, and patriotism. He volunteers to go to Vietnam, when certainly the majority of young kids were starting to turn against the war. The film leads you through some confusing scenes with all the horrors of war you can imagine. Cruise starts his deep dive into the dark spots in his mind that he never wanted to visit. He starts doubting his choice, his whole basis for life.Cruise/Kovic returns to an uninterested and uncaring country. He does a terrific job of portraying Kovic struggling with just everything. Finally Kovic decides that he can be a patriot, but be against a war that he so loyally believed in, and gave his physical being to support.Amazing performance. Not much supporting cast is the only negative, though Willem Defoe plays a wounded buddy he meets while trying to come to grips with the aftermath in a drunken visit to Mexico. I hope Cruise wins an Academy award someday - he really deserves it for roles like this where he should have gotten a nod, or the many other fine roles he turned in, like in Rainman or that Jerry Maquire movie as a football agent. If you want to revisit the 60s and 70s with vivid realism, and a bit of overdoing by Oliver Stone, watch Born on the 4th of July. Watch the archive special feature with an in person interview with Kovic and Brian Gumbel - pretty good stuff too. Enjoy.",7,0,7,2 June 2014
Sully," Good depiction of heroism
","Sully features a strong performance by Tom Hanks as the Captain of a fateful US Airways flight that skirted death by a miraculous successful water landing in the Hudson River after taking off from Laguardia airport in NYC. This reminded me a bit of the fictitious movie Flight, where the pilot did something heroic, then was questioned every which way about why it happened. In this case, why could you not get back safely to an airport.We know the ending of the event, but Sully gives you a behind the scenes feeler into what happened afterwards.The weakness of the film is that there was that one point (the takeoff incident) that was the focus, nothing else. Eastwood as director tried to bring in other events in Sully's life about his love of flying, his youth, his relationship with his wife, but those added really very little to the story. I would have liked to see more info about the co-pilot, excellently played by Aaron Eckhert. That might have helped support the story better. But maybe there was no drama there to build on. Eastwood tried to build some supporting drama, but his only real focus was the crew's reaction after the poop hit the fans, literally. That left very little to excite the viewer.The film takes some swipes at bureaucracy, and the often times idiocy of people who were not there taking judgment. It's unclear if the FAA questioned ANY of the passengers who had survived, or whether they just investigated based on black box data.The flight scenes are terrifically realistic, and the heroism of the entire crew under fire was just incredible. I recommend Sully as a very good depiction of a real life event. It's a film that is worth seeing in spite of the short focus of the plot. Enjoy.",7,1,2,15 January 2017
The Martian," Solid Landing by The Martian
","I had my doubts that a more or less single-actor film would be successful, but The Martian proved me wrong. Matt Damon was terrific in a Hollywood-esque storyline. He plays a botanist who is on the Ares mission to Mars. I guess this was the third mission. Mars is apparently prone to major storms, and one strikes the team, forcing an emergency evacuation. In the midst of the evacuation, Damon gets lost and seemingly is dead. The crew takes off.The rest is a story of survival against the basic human needs, like food, water, and air. But also a battle to touch the planet he left behind. There was actually a lot of comedy in this film. Damon jokes at being the first for so many different activities there. Well shoot, he's the only living being on the planet.The scenery / graphics were excellent. The co-actors deliver their roles - space jockey pilot, stoic commander, a-hole mission commander back on Earth. They all fit into a nicely scripted screenplay.There are some twists and turns as you would expect, and a Hollywood ending that leaves you cheering, despite the improbability. But this is the movies - you want entertainment - the Martian delivers.Nice job by everyone. Enjoy.",8,1,1,10 April 2016
