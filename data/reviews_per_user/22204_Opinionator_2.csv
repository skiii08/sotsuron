United 93," Brutal Camera Work
","United 93 was more or less on par with the quality of a made-for-TV movie. It should never have been put on the big screen.The camera work was absolutely terrible. The shaking camera gave me motion sickness and I had to lay down in the theater to try and watch it, before finally walking out. The poor camera-work aside, there just enough of a story to warrant a full length motion picture. Everyone who had turned on a television over a two year period following 9/11 already knew the story. A full length movie was a totally unnecessary exploitation and a complete waste of my time.",4,0,2,22 May 2007
The Aviator," Never Quite Ended
","To be entirely honest, the movie was fairly entertaining,for the first hour and a half maybe. But MY GOD! Sitting in the theater was just brutal, a few times I thought it was about to end and I was pleased, and thought it was a good movie, but it just became ridiculous, it kept going and going and became extremely tiring. Hearing Leo repeat the same thing like 50 times (doubt thats even an exaggeration) because he had some disorder *just shakes head* it was brutal. After the movie was finished my friend and i just stared at each other, ran outside and screamed. Couldn't believe we actually sat though it. The movie could have been really good, I just think it could have been edited a heck of a lot more to reduce its length considerably. THEN I would find it tolerable.",1,7,14,12 April 2005
