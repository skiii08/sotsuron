Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Worsest film I have ever seen
","I do not know how Mr Cohen and his director got away with it. This film does not only have any artistic value but is downright racist as well. The film has no concept and if Borat is out there to get Americans or laugh about Kazakhstan the only person he makes look bad is himself - Sacha Baron. There certainly are real, deep problems in American society but Mr Cohen is not targeting any of them - quite clearly for the reason that for this mission more talent and intelligence is needed. All he is doing is hassling normal middle class people who actually give very polite and intelligent answers to his stupid questions. Most of the people interviewed react with dignity and surprising calm to all idiotic situations that Borat creates. The character of Borat is a character of a pervert and if I met somebody like him I would call police straight away or at least show him the door. Also the film is an insult to the country of Kazakhstan.They have not deserved it in any way. It shows clearly that Borat knows nothing about real Kazakhstan and I doubt he has ever been there. If similar film had been made about any Western European country it would have been an international scandal. But as it's Kazakhstan, it is safe to make ignorant, inferior jokes. There was a scandal on British TV recently on reality TV show Big Brother and one participant, Jade Goody lost her career over the racist comments she made on TV over an Indian movie star. The whole country stood up for the offended Indian woman.But the jokes Mr Cohen makes on account of Kazakhstan people are much worse - how on the Earth is he getting away with it? It's not funny. The whole film is as if created by a mentally challenged 5-years old. I do not understand how general rating of this film can be 7 out of 10. This film is cruel both towards Kazakhstan and regular, normal USA people; it's ignorant, stupid, racist and without any talent. It's complete carbage. The only thing that had any value in this film were the real folksongs in the soundtrack. They were like flowers in the middle of dirt.",1,9,19,20 May 2007
