The Incredible Hulk," What a mess, man?..
","Iron Man is a good film. Incredible Hulk is a film with no plot and no subject, so it's a bad film.First, where's goddamn logic? Edward would do anything to kill Hulk, which is protecting his life from bad general and his soldiers. OK, maybe he's ready to sacrifice his life - but Hulk saves Edward's girl too - he would sacrifice her life?Then, where's so popular ''character relations''? Scene: daughter tells the general that he is her father no more. A few minutes later, after experiencing the consequences of the generals deeds, Edwards tells 'please' to the general, and the daughter calls him a father.I won't even try to discuss the military logic 'cause it's not even a mess, it's a usual black hole.And after all this, a character from good film appears in a bad film! Tony Stark, an unusual character from 16+ movie which had a plot and no repellent and redundant sentiments - Tony Stark appears in the second Hulk movie! And doesn't he turn into a bad guy a way too fast? But, hey! there's no character relations in Incredible Hulk, so what am I asking for?Now I can feel the whole power of Hollywood script writers crisis... Sorry for the negative, the movie earned it. Big money, big people, big mess. Thanks for reading me.",3,9,18,24 September 2008
