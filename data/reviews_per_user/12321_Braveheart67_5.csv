Conquest 1453," I don't like
","It could be a great movie, but it didn't. Visual effects are very bad, not realistic at all. It would have been a very good epic movie if it had a crowded staff of extras or stuntman. Spartacus, made by Kubrick 60 years ago, is much more realistic.",3,0,1,7 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Of course, the first trilogy is separate :)
","Because I watched all the movies, I had to watch this. I liked the last film in the second series. I liked the last film in this series. Of course, the first trilogy is separate :)",7,3,6,24 December 2019
Total Recall," It still works.
","Years later, they made a repeat of this movie. Of course, it was not the same beauty. I watched the first movie again. Our childhood was also a very important movie. Visual effects still look beautiful. It's nostalgia to see the youth of the actors.",7,2,2,19 January 2020
Zombieland," The movie gave me hope.
","It was the most enjoyable Zombie movie I watched. The characters and the events were funny. In one way, the movie is promising, even if the world is at an end, people can have fun. I prefer this instead of 'the walking dead.'",7,0,0,22 April 2020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," is this film comedy ?
","This movie is definitely the worst movie in the batman series. It is maybe one of the worst films of the Superman series. The movie is full of nonsense, I laughed a lot while watching it. They spent so much money, it was a pity.",2,2,7,14 May 2020
