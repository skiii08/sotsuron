Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Faithful to the first 3 episodes
","Hype is a dangerous thing. Hype is a tool of marketing. Hype leads to high expectations, high expectations lead to disappointment, disappointment... leads anger. Anger at the movie for it not being 'good enough.' Anger at them for tricking you. But before the anger consumes you, ask yourself how good were the originals? Why did they become cult films? It was because there was something fundamental at their core, something that few other films had. That same something is present in today's Episode 1. It's sitting there so quietly, and you may not recognize it because of all the junk that the studios have spat out for the last 16 years. I recommend re-watching the originals before you go see it. Let the hype be damned. Don't forget why you loved the first ones, and don't go looking for something different in this film. After you see it give it some time to turn itself over in your mind before you either praise it or condemm it. I, for one, was sad when i left the theater... why you might ask? Because i don't want to wait two more years.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
