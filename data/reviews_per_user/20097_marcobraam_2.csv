Requiem for a Dream," my god, what a movie!!!
","Well, we have a new number one. It used to be 'abre los ojos'but now there is a new extreme movie that makes your head explode. (almost of course). What a rush. It is not really about drugs, it is about pain, and what people do with their lives. A beautiful love-experience between two beautiful young people gets destroyed by themselves. That really grabbed me. A mother who is obsessed by gettin'thin because of a freaky gameshow, and ends up in a hospital for mentally diseased. The 'last five minutes rush' was mindblowing, and i almost feel love for a director who can do such things.thank you God for some good quality from time to time, we really need it to survive all that one dimentional average crap.Marco Braam",Null,0,1,24 March 2002
The Fast and the Furious," no story, great action!!!
","Well, i saw this one at home, and i am the happy owner of a serious hometheater-system. And you really need that for a satisfying movie-experience with this one. But when the guys start they're engines, man that really hit me. The floor was pounding happy with the beats of the 8 cylinders. The story sucked, i must say, but the action is great, but you must love cars, and you do need a need for speed. I hated the 'guys dont try this at home' warning, but ok, there are some looneys who may try driving under a large truck for a few seconds. I really really enjoyed this non-pretentious movie, straight up, guys only, good beer, and you'll have a great night.",7,1,1,15 April 2002
