Mission: Impossible III," M:I-3 is a GREAT ACTION ADVENTURE movie. A fun ride.
","JJ Abrams is at the top of his game. I can't remember the last time I saw an action movie that really impressed me like MI3 did. Hmm... wow... Man on Fire maybe? Geez, great action flicks are so few and far between. Anyways, M:I-3 was smart, tight, and the pacing was just right. Action sequences were incredible and inventive. Tom Cruise is good as he always is and the supporting cast meshed well together. Ving never fails to bring in the needed comic relief. Philip Seymour Hoffman was great as well. Finally, a worthy adversary. I hate it when the villain lacks charisma and presence. Also, I'd like to mention that the cinematography was great and the film stock they used resulted in gorgeous images. Lastly, we got to leave poor Tom Cruise alone. Who cares about his personal life when he can ACT so damn well? This movie may not be the best vehicle to showcase his great thespian abilities but he's great in this film. Let him be. I'd recommend M;I-3 highly. Brings life back into the M:I franchise.",10,9,18,28 April 2006
