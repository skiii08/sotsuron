Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The franchise continues for another twenty years.
","I give the movie a 10/10 for sheer effort, imagination and escapism. Though it was very well executed I still get the impression that George Lucas is trying to sell a product rather than trying to just tell a story.There were several superfluous scenes (example: the pod race) which add nothing to the story and are just tie-ins to the inevitable video game.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
The Matrix," Awesome execution of a fundamentally flawed concept.
","If you like science fiction then this film should definitely be on your top ten.  I give the movie a 9/10 rating.  The special effects were good (but not nearly enough of them) and blended extremely well with the scenes.What I like most about The Matrix: Laurence Fishbourne; Well-thought out story; Better execution of the story than any movie of its genre ever attempted.What I like least about the Matrix: Too few action scenes and special effects;  The premise--I still don't think that it is possible to virtually generate 'reality' down to the level required.  After all, reality is a very individual experience; so you would have to fake it for everyone.",9,0,1,26 May 1999
