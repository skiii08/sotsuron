The Avengers," Awesomeness in every way!!!!!!
","I saw this movie and it blew away my mind. The 2,5 hour sit wasn't long enough, I wanted more!!!!! Mark Ruffalo playing Bruce Banner was best I have seen so far and seeing the Hulk smashing Thor into a building just after a heavy fight against the aliens was pure win and made my eyes tear of laughter! Than Loki saying something and gets interrupted by the Hulk who smashes Loki into the ground afterwards saying 'puny god' was another exact replica off the comic book hero I so love and enjoy. Just seeing this in that movie made the movie 8 out of 10. The two extra stars was cause the rest of the movie was just brilliantly put together, with the mayhem, the jokes, the storyline, the depths of most characters! Yes, I know people wanted to see more depths in the storyline, but come on, you got 6 Avengers with all different stories, the villains who have there story, and you need to make a movie that isn't to long to let it stretch to much, but still contain every ingredient to make it a good movie. No, not a good movie, an excellent movie, like a true superhero movie should be. Don't compare this movie to other superhero movies!!! There you only have 1 character and 1 villain to explain and rest is story. Compare this when you saw the previous story lines of the main characters. So watch Iron Man 1 and 2 and The Incredible Hulk (with Edward Norton, not as good as Mark Ruffalo, but you will know the background better for The Avengers) and Thor and Captain America first! You will have enough knowledge to see this movie and rate it excellent. Don't go here to expect a high intelligence movie or rate it with The Dark Knight (who was good, but stand alone and DC comics, not Marvel, different studios, different styles!). Im waiting for The Dark Knight Rises, cause I love those movies as well and the comics and Hulk and Batman are my two out of three most favorite heroes. Sorry Spidey, but your first real good movie has yet to come. This movie was awesome and had everything! Thank you Josh Whedon for displaying the characters as if they were straight out of the comic. Thank you for this joy in my life :)",10,15,30,28 April 2012
