United 93," Absorbing, intense, and appropriately moving
","Clearly comes across as a story that ought to and had to be told and never too soon... a reenactment that drives home the impact and meaning of that tragic day.In no wise is it exploitative nor lurid entertainment, but satisfactorily an artful, tasteful, apt and appropriate tribute to the human spirit in the face of fear, terror and misguided fanaticism. The brilliant editing, with its insightful cross-cutting from various POVs is superb and the pacing, suspense and intensity at times is unnerving. The heart-pounding progression toward inexorable fate renders a harrowing experience that culminates in a moving (lump-in-throat, tear-inspiring) close.I cannot urge enough that those that will resist or refuse to allow themselves to go through it, should shrug away the misgivings opposed to it and give the episode its due. You must not look away--Lest we forget...or let it sink into postscript-of-history status. The filmmakers have done the entire thing proud and have rendered a true homage to those who lost their lives heroically. A fine work indeed.",9,2,5,6 May 2006
