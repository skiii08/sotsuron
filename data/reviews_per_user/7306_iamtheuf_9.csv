Blade Runner 2049," What the first movie should have been
","I saw the first film long ago. Re watched it before this came out expecting it to live up to its expectation...it does not. The first film is dull and slow. This film is also slow. But it makes up for it with stunning visuals, a clever and intriguing plot, and some deep themes.",9,1,12,23 April 2018
Captain Marvel," Worst Movie in the MCU
","Bland and formulaic entry into the marvel universe. More and more the Marvel movies are becoming generic plug and play action movies with the same humor and the same plot, with only minor variations in character names and other details.Both Brie Larson and Samuel Jackson are good actors, but this movie makes them both look bad. Their chemistry is awful and their banter comes off as forced. I wouldn't have known Captain Marvel was supposed to be funny if I hadn't been repeatedly told by the dialogue.As others have said, there also issues with the hero being over powered.That said, the action is often quite good and the visuals are as stunning as any other Marvel film.",5,8,18,16 March 2019
Aquaman," Visually Stunning, Otherwise Like A Below Average Marvel Movie
","I saw someone in another review say that the 10/10s are bots. I hope so...because that's really the only explanation I can understand. Who would give this a 10?The movie isn't bad. You'll be entertained if your expectations aren't too high. But there's some bad acting and really cringe worthy lines. Some of the plot doesn't make sense, and the parts that do are 100% predictable.Ordinarily I would give this movie a 6 or even a 5, but there are two redeeming graces that make it stand out.First, the visuals. Yes, about 80% of what you seen on screen is CGI, but it blends very well and does not look out of place. If you don't notice it, who cares?In the age of Marvel, Star Wars, and other spectacles, it's not easy to impress me with visuals alone. What really pushes this one over the edge is the art direction. It's creative, beautiful, and sometimes frightening.The second redeeming aspect of this movie is a very heart warming love story. It's not even close to the focus of the movie. A second love story gets much more time, and falls completely flat.But the first love story is a surprising spot of tenderness in a blow um ups blockbuster.This movie is a solid 7. The people giving it 10s are raising your expectations way too high. If you believe them now, you'll probably be very disappointed when you see it.Don't expect too much and you'll enjoy yourself.",7,0,2,25 December 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Best Thor Movie, Average Marvel Movie
",The first Thor sucked. Second one is decent. This if the only good one. It's the best Thor movie but not among the best marvel movies. The addition of humor lands unevenly. Sometimes its a welcome addition. Sometimes it feels out of place and takes you away from the plot. Somethings are just cheesy and unnecessary (think naked Hulk and Hulk dick jokes).,7,1,2,23 April 2018
Ready Player One," Great for those who haven't read the book
",I haven't read the book so I have no complaints. This is an outstanding adventure/mystery film. Very unique concepts. Great action. Thought provoking.,9,0,1,23 April 2018
Wanted," Competition for Matrix and John Wick
","Honestly could not believe all the negative reviews on here or that the average score was below 8.0. I saw this movie in theaters when it came out with a group of about 6 people. Everyone loved it and it was one of those movies where as you walked out everyone knew it would be ridiculous to ask 'did you like it?' Instead, the questions were 'what was your favorite part' and 'do you rank this above or below *insert all time great action movie.*'I just rewatched it with my dad who was seeing it for the first time. He also loved it and he's a very picky moviegoer. 
This is an imaginative superreal action movie much like the Matrix or John Wick. It tells a sort of fantasy story a lot of people can relate to. The acting is on point and it has some of the most imaginative and heart pumping action sequences I've ever seen in a movie.The negative reviewers here often seem to have not even seen the movie, making bizarre incorrect claims like 'it never tells you why they have super human powers.' It does, not in great detail, but that wasn't necessary and would probably have detracted from the experience.See it for yourself. If you",9,2,3,7 August 2019
A Quiet Place," Remarkable Film with Lackluster Ending
","I'm going to avoid spoilers, but I found the ending unsatisfying. That's a shame because otherwise the movie is a refreshingly unique horror/suspense film with great acting and characterization.",7,1,2,23 April 2018
Coco," Muchas Gracias Pixar
",This is hands down one of the best Pixar films ever released. It exposes audiences to a culture many Americans may be unfamiliar with and its generally fun and engaging.,9,1,2,23 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Master Piece. Your boos mean nothing to me, I've seen what makes you cheer.
","Rewatching the Last Jedi. This movie is a master piece. I know that's an unpopular opinion, but I never put much stock in judging truth by popularity.Rían Johnson is an amazing writer and director. Cannot say the same about JJ Abrams and his shallow derivative plots. The only good part of Force Awakens was Kilo killing his father.Otherwise FA was just a rehashed 'A New Hope.' New Death Star. New Emperor. New empire. New Vader. New orphan from a desert planet with force powers and mysterious parentage.Derivative. Crap. Stale.Why did Luke's adventure even matter if everything gets reset in the sequel?Johnson as a true Star Wars fan saw that flaw. So the Last Jedi is a rebuke to J.J.Luke tells us this in his first scene, when he tosses out the lightsaber. He is throwing away the grandiose end scene that he was given. Luke isn't going to fit our expectations. Because if history had really gone the way JJ told it in Force Awakens, Luke would **absolutely** be this jaded.And that's the most confusing part of me. People complained about jaded Luke and the scene where he tosses the lightsaber. But like most complaints about the Last Jedi, that's one of my favorite parts.I also love that Rey's parents are no body. Johnson is telling us quite literally that anyone can be a hero. You don't have to come from special parents like Luke. This is a new story.I love that Snoke dies with no explanation of his back story. We aren't doing the Emperor thing again. This is about Rey and Kylo now, both of whom have become more compelling characters this time.Now, there are some silly things that were Kathleen Kennedy's ideas, like floating Leia. Rose is a mostly pointless character who stops Finn from sacrificing himself. Admiral Akbar should have been the second in command, not purple hair lady. But these are all things Johnson was rumored to be against.What Johnson gave us was an original story. Something JJ failed to give us with the Force Awakens.So as I see the final chapter tonight, I am hopeful but not optimistic. I wish JJ luck, but I'm almost positive Rían Johnson would have done a better job.Johnson knew what Abrams did not. He was focused on the future, not stuck in the past. And he tells the audience why: 'Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.'The past is written. The future is ours.",10,11,31,21 December 2019
