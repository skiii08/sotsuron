E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," !
","I saw this movie, I was impressed depth of bond of alien and human. It is impossible that there are alien on the earth but, appears in this movie alien, ET is very lovely. I thought if alien come to earth, nobody believed surely.Scene that I have the most impressive is that Elliott lure ET with the late chocolate marble. Then Eliott instructioned to his room with chocolate, and hid in closet. This scene just a childlike action. In any event nothing is voice of ET. ET was exploring the home whatever he like. ET remember many words relentlessly with toys, newspaper and TV. Also, ET interested in phone at home. I laughed of looking for the house of ET at many scenes. The noted scene in case ET returns to the universe was impressed truly. I think that ET became gentle before coming to the earth, and returned and went to the space.",7,0,1,10 November 2013

","Action in case this movie robs was interesting. The burglar has been committed without killing people, and taking a hostage, but this movie hero, Tag fall in love with A hostage's woman. The love of the prohibition of two persons was interesting.However, I thought that the place which does not tell a woman about true character was pitiful because Tag is masked. I waited for when A woman gets to know that a criminal is Michae with a pounding heart. I thought that it understood in voice if he was me. However, if I was which is a hostage, I will not think as usual. And I fount persons cannot think and cannot do anything in polar.I was surprised at a burglar family's teamwork, and the merit of performance. Although he did not want to become a burglar, I thought that they were so cool. I recognized that fail in love with someone.",8,0,1,10 November 2013

","The hero has attachment for the tiger, even when it is small, he thought that there was the heart also in an animal. I also think that an animal as well as him has the heart like people. However, his father said to him, 'A tiger is a savage beast which is not your friend.'It became what is not forgotten for him every day of drift with Parka exceeding 200 days. I think that it was absolutely ready for death, if he was me. While there is also no food on the sea, he surely considers being frightened of fear of being eaten by him. Since he believed parka and did not suspect it from the bottom of his heart, he was both able to live. Finally, Pakar disappeared in woods, without turning around. The hero shed large tears. What was the meaning of the tear? I consider the body which nothing was finally able to tell to the bravely living war comrade.",9,0,2,20 November 2013
