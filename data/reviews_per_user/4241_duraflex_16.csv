First Man," Depressing portrayal of a monumental achievement
","This is a depressing look at a real-life historical achievement and the first man to land on the moon. It is too bad that the movie was made by people that are too young to understand and convey the times, the emotions or the reasons that the United States embarked on the space program with the goal of sending, landing and returning men to the moon and back.Ryan Gosling is almost adequate in the role of Neil Armstrong. Unfortunately, the script is written to make Neil look like a moody, humorless soul who for years is on the brink of clinical depression. This was NOT an accurate portrayal of the real Neil Armstrong. He was a brilliant, brave, conservative, soft-spoken man with humility, wit and charm. His many interviews were usually filled with smiles and optimism but that is not the way he is portrayed in First Man.The visual effects are generally good but they don't make up for a poor script that denies any sense of patriotism and the importance of the Apollo program in the Cold War with the Soviet Union.The sound is very uneven in clarity and levels. Much of the music - especially during the lunar landing - is loud, awkward and unnecessary.In all, not a very good film made by pretentious people who think they know how to tell a story. Documentaries about Apollo 11 aired on the History, Smithsonian Channel and CBS are much better.",3,1,2,22 July 2019
The Aviator," Very uneven movie
","Overly stylized look at the life of eccentric visionary and genius Howard Hughes.Scorcese and company cannot decide how to portray this man.For me, the best scenes were the congressional hearings held by a corrupt senator who was bought and paid for by the head of PAN-AM airways. Howard Hughes worked himself up to verbally ripping Senator Brewster to shreds. More could have been done about the success of TWA, the constellation airliner and the foundation that Hughes laid for safe, affordable commercial air transportation",6,2,5,29 May 2007
The Alamo," ALAMO 2004 needed a better set up but ending was very good
",I am glad this movie included the victorious BATTLE OF SAN JACINTO which occurred about 6 weeks after the siege of the Alamo. Amazing to see that 800 Texans defeated 1600 Mexicans in 18 MINUTES.The battle at the Alamo was the prelude to that victory at San Jacinto over Santa Anna where his life was traded for Texas independence.Other movies left this out and it's important in explaining how Texas split from Mexico to become the 28th state of the United States.What this film did not clearly develop were the historical circumstances that led to the Alamo battle. Mexico had encouraged white settlements in the area and then decided otherwise. White Texians and Mexican Tejanos lived in relative peace together in the San Antonio area. They even fought together at the Alamo and at San Jacinto.Included on the DVD is a deleted scene from the 2004 movie which showed Mexican General Cos and his defeated Mexican troops marching out of San Antonio after a battle that happened PRIOR to the Alamo. Cos had agreed to leave the settlements alone but Santa Anna broke that pledge. Those scenes should NOT have been deleted.The beginning of Alamo 2004 is too murky. What this movie needed was a better set up and a voice-over narrative to more clearly explain what was going on. HOW THE WEST WAS WON employed this technique and it used Spencer Tracy as the narrator. BEN-HUR used the technique as well. Both of those were historical fiction based on historical fact. Both were enormously successful. This movie should have been as well.,7,7,9,14 June 2007
Spider-Man," Pleasant surprise
","Although I grew up reading and watching Superman, Superboy and Batman, I ignored the SpiderMan comics entirely.  On a whim, I rented the DVD and found it very entertaining - although I would have been a little lost without using the optional pop-up info windows.Tobey McGuire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker/SpiderMan.  He brings a believability to the character and shows warmth and sensitivity as well as great strength and intelligence.The 'flying spider' effects are phenomenally well-done.",10,1,1,7 January 2003
Independence Day," Senseless, Stupid, Violent
","There is nothing to recommend this horrible movie. To graphically depict widespread death and destruction and to computer-generate marvelous landmarks being obliterated one after another is an unconscionable travesty in the name of entertainment and the quest of the almighty dollar, peso, yen etc. There is enough real mayhem in too many parts of the world to make this mess unnecessary. Nothing can justify this flick - it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. This is violence and destruction aimed at a cretin populace that is too stupid to know right from wrong or good from bad.Will Smith is his unbearable self. There is no humor in this story. Overall, Independence Day is a sickening and perverse waste of time, money and talent. The producers, actors and studio made a fortune by creating this stupid, senseless 'thing'.I saw it at a friend's house on DVD and didn't pay a dime. I feel like they owe me for wasting 2 hours of my life watching this load. It stinks out loud.",1,8,15,28 January 2007
Mamma Mia!," Almost ruined ABBA music for me
","Somehow I thought the soundtrack would have ABBA performances in it - not so. Instead, the actors 'sing' ABBA's music - but not well.And Pierce Brosnan may be a hunk to look at but when he tries to sing, yikes- he turns into a comic character. He's simply awful but probably the funniest thing in the film watching him struggle through his songs.Meryl Streep may be a decent actress - but she is not a singer.Phyllida Lloyd's directing is completely amateur, disturbingly frenetic and often illogical - she had no idea what she was doing. The wacky camera angles, pace and editing are often arbitrary and meaningless.This film is a mess. Don't waste your time or money.The only reason to give it a 2 instead of a 1 was the beautiful scenery.My spouse and could not figure out why anyone regarded this as a hit.Executive producers were Mr and Mrs Tom Hanks - what were they thinking?",2,2,3,7 February 2010
JFK," Artful fiction that badly distorts the facts
","A film for the gullible and ignorant who are stupid enough to buy into Oliver Stone's pack of lies. Stone contrived this load of misinformation and manure mostly just to make himself rich. It serves no legitimate purpose. The film is Oliver's twisting of facts and pure fabrication.Garrison never made the closing argument speech that Kevin Costner delivered in the JFK film. NEVER MADE SUCH A SPEECH yet it's the climax of the film.That is just one of the many glaring things in this film that are kluged. The HISTORY CHANNEL did a thorough job of debunking it.In JFK, Oliver Stone takes history and fictionalizes it to make it a more dramatic, commercial piece that he passes off as re-enacting history. In fact, much of Stone's 'JFK' movie is a lie, it never happened as Stone depicted it.Oliver Stone has admitted using 'artistic license' in creating the film but his depiction goes way beyond that. It's all so convincingly portrayed that many people have taken it as fact. It's not unlike the Jon Stewart Daily Show treatment of the news or Michael Moore's distortions in his 'documentaries'.If Stone's upcoming movie 'W' is anything like his previous work - it will be nothing more than a new collection of Stone's lies and distortions - simply not to be believed. Nevertheless, a lazy and ignorant populace will soak it up as fact and make Oliver Stone a lot more money.",1,13,38,20 September 2008
Rocky," Tough man with a tender heart
","There was something very genuine and likable about this character when Stallone created ROCKY in 1976.Young Rocky could fight like a bat out of hell but he had a tender side toward animals, children and the homely girl that worked in the pet store near the gym where he worked out.This was a character we quickly came to care about. He wasn't evil and he didn't have an agenda to use people. He just wanted to be somebody.It's a lesson in humility and perseverance and ultimately achievement.If you only ever see one ROCKY, this is the one to watch. Rocky 2 and 3 are also good. Rocky 4 and 5 - not as good as the others.",10,1,2,25 March 2007
The Da Vinci Code," This movie is a travesty
","If a movie like this was made about Moses or Mohammed, there would be outrage throughout the world. But if you make a movie that tries to undermine Jesus and Christianity in the guise of 'fiction', you apparently get a pass. Millions of gullible lemmings fill the theaters. The producers, cast and crew make a fortune promulgating a lie. The premise that Jesus married and fathered a child is preposterous and not based on any shred of historical or Biblical evidence. Even the authors call it fiction - so why make such a movie except to get rich off a mind-numbed public. H.L. Mencken was right and the box office success of this tripe proves it: 'NO ONE EVER WENT BROKE UNDERESTIMATING THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE American PEOPLE.'I have lost all respect for Ronnie Howard and Tom Hanks to have taken on such a project. They and everyone else associated with this travesty should be deeply ashamed.",1,1,5,27 May 2006
Titanic," TITANIC in 3-D is even better than the original
","James Cameron really knows how to tell a story and make an amazing movie.This film holds up brilliantly 15 years after its initial release. The new 3-D version is fantastic - especially the shots of the ship. The underwater scenes are stunning. It is all done masterfully.How they go back and remake a live action film into 3-D is a mystery to me but the magic works. In recent years, I choose to see most films on DVD or Blu-Ray, but this one was worth a trip to the theater. I never left my seat once.Seeing the film again since the real life passing of Gloria Stuart (old Rose) and seeing it on the 100th anniversary of Titanic's one and only sailing made it that much more poignant.",10,2,5,12 April 2012
It's a Wonderful Life," See WONDERFUL LIFE on BluRay
","If you want to really appreciate this wonderful film, be sure to see it on BluRay.In 2009, the film was issued on BluRay in pristine form.The picture and sound are both clean and crystal clear and what you get is a better audio-video experience than theater audiences had when this was first released.I personally prefer the artfully colorized version and adjusted my TV with the color level up about 10% above normal. Film to video restoration/transfers do not get any better than this.Frank Capra's masterpiece honors the ideal of a good man who lives a good life but doesn't realize how blessed he is until it's almost too late. Watching it anytime of the year - but especially at Christmas - is an inspiring experience.",10,2,5,4 January 2014
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," A waste of Will Ferrell's talent. A waste of time & money to see it.
","Will Ferrell can be a very funny guy. Although there a few laugh-out-loud moments in this film, mostly it is just plain stupid - written by someone with little understanding of the early 1970s or the situation he attempts to portray.Mostly 'Anchorman' is a poorly written movie. The film's writer was born in 1968 and apparently did little research on the subject. After all, that would make him only about 5 years old at the time he is attempting to re-create. That would be okay if he had substituted research for experience. However, in an interview on the DVD, the writer alludes to the movie's premise being based on the late TV newswoman Jessica Savitch coming to anchor in Philadelphia and the way the male news team went nuts over it. She had already been a success in Texas and was generally well accepted at KYW in Philadelphia. In fact, by the early 1970s, women in TV were more than a novelty. In Philadelphia, where the writer was born, two women - Marciarose and Trudy Haynes - were already well established at that same station for several years by the time Savitch got there - and Haynes was black. What's more, women on network TV news had already become fairly commonplace - including Pauline Fredericks, Nancy Dickerson, and Barbara Walters - among many others. However, all that being said - the idea that a particularly dumb male news team may possibly feel threatened by a new female on-air personality might have some comedic potential. The fact is that it doesn't do it here.There is also a senseless violent fight scene that tries to be funny - it's not funny - and neither is most of this very stupid movie.",3,2,5,13 February 2005
Music and Lyrics," A magic pair in a delightful romantic comedy
","There aren't many people who can light up a movie (or TV) screen anymore but Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore accomplish the magic. These two define 'movie stars' of the 21st century.This pair is simply delightful and I found myself pulling them from the first time they met.We already knew they could act but who knew they could sing? Grant also learned to dance and play the piano for the role. For a guy who is now 47, he has more appeal than many guys half his age. The fact that an attractive woman 15 years younger would be attracted to him is totally believable. Grant is good-looking, charming and he has a heart. This is probably his best performance since TWO WEEKS NOTICE.If you're looking for a fun and uplifting date movie, this will do the trick. A very pleasant film.",9,1,2,14 October 2007
Fifty Shades of Grey," Ugly and Perverted
","Why anyone would spend anything to see this sicko film is beyond reason. Bondage is mental illness in action.Sex between a loving man and and woman is great but this retarded film perverts it into something dark, scary and awful. There have been romantic and erotic films made that deal with love and sex in a healthy positive way but this is not that kind of film. not even close. And the perverts behind this mess release it on Valentine's Day - - that's really sick. Looking for a great romantic film - try 'The Way We Were', 'A Man and a Woman', 'Ghost', 'Blow-Up', 'Romeo & Juliet'(both 1969 & 1996), 'Ever After', 'When Harry Met Sally', 'Splendor in the Grass', Officer and a Gentleman'.",1,7,17,15 February 2015
Tarzan," Simply Fantastic !!!
","Disney Studios new TARZAN is in a league with the best animated features the studio has ever produced - a welcome and refreshing upbeat change from Hunchback and Mulan.It has the heart of Pinnochio, the spunkiness of Peter Pan, the soul of Aladdin and a host of wonderful new qualities all its own.The story moves rapidly and well and the movie moves along so fast you just don't want it to end.  Bring your snacks into the theater before it begins because once the film rolls, you won't want to get up to get anything for fear of missing a critical moment or scene.The whole look is so enchanting - the jungle lush and green - the expressions on all the characters so engaging. Rosie O'Donnell's young gorilla is a comic treat and Tarzan himself the ultimate charmer and hero.Great music, beautiful artwork, gorgeous state-of-the-art animation and 3-D effects all serve to enhance a time-tested classic story.  We loved it and hope you will too!",10,2,2,21 June 1999
The Social Network," Harvard President is beyond obnoxious
","Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed as a maniacal and egotistical punk who happens to be a computer programming wizard. He is also shown to be an insecure and unprincipled young man who was easily manipulated by another egomaniacal internet guru who worms his way into facebook and ends up with a substantial share of the company. Mark also sells out his co-founder Eduardo Saverin leaving him with not his original 30% but a mere .03 percent of the company.However, the standout character for me in this film is the Harvard University President Larry Summers - who is incredibly obnoxious and arrogant. Summers fails to see the potential value of the social networking website. He totally blows off the Winklevoss brothers who attempt to bring to his attention the theft of their intellectual property in violation of Harvard student policy. Summers completely dismisses them and it doesn't take much research or insight to figure out why. This is the same man who said in 2005 that the under-representation of women in science and engineering could be due to a 'different availability of aptitude at the high end'.Actor Douglas Urbanski plays the role perfectly and even looks a lot like Summers.The Winklevoss' case may yet go to the U.S. Supreme Court based on the assertion that the settlement they accepted in 2008 was based on an inaccurate undervaluation of the company.",8,0,0,3 June 2011
