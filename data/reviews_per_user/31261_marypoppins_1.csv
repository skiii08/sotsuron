The Sound of Music," I ADORE this film!
","Without doubt, the greatest musical ever made...It's impossible not to sing along (and to wish you had enough curtains to make all those clothes with when you're feeling a bit hard up!!!) The ultimate feel good film guaranteed to cheer you up even on the worst of days.",10,3,10,22 August 2001
