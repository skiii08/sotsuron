Hereditary," It is creepy, suspensful and intelligent family horror story
","This film is a successful horror at several levels. The screenplay contains at least two different basic aspects, each of them are intersting on its own, but writer and director Ari Aster is able to fuse it into a powerful but standalone story, using not your average jumpscares but a great suspense-building.
On the surface 'Hereditary' is rather a family drama than horror, the whole storyline focuses on a members of one family with dark past. Toni Colett does a great acting here, and truly sparks the screen. The film invests a lot in characters, since it's only a handful of them here, so don't expect immediate drive into the ghosts activity or demonic posession. It's a film about dissolution of a one particular famliy, and such process Asters shows with great attention to the details. There's no direct social commentary here, it's rather about personal degeneration and desperation, about the past that still haunts.
Under all this dramatic surface lies great modern horror, made with respect to classical themes and style. As story goes by, transition from family drama to occult horror begins, and Aster manages to procced it smoothly. A lot of traditional horror elements (such as disturbing dreams, bizarre rites, and so on) can be found here, but this film relies more on the of tension and eerie logic of the events than on conventional jumpscares or blood and guts. 
Overall, it's a great slow-burner, made with all respect to genre fans, and luckily escaping most of the cliches - a rare film among contemporary horror films. if you like dark and nervous movies with acting over SFX, put this one on your watch list.",7,18,43,3 June 2018
Dawn of the Dead," Classic Remake of a Classic Horror
","The basic question, which is always appears when one speaks about a remake is obvious: 'what's changed?' Well, to cut a long story short – in this installment of a classic zombie horror everything is changed, but it is still 'Dawn Of The Dead' – Turbo Edition now. Let us recall what original movie is. George A. Romero' s 'Dawn Of The Dead' is an epic zombie horror with a strong elements of satire and social criticism. There's a lot of space to think and to interpret, but there's also a lot of character development and (of course, bloody) action. And – this is the first thing you should keep in mind while watching this remake – new 'Dawn of the Dead' is the more bloody, more gory and more action-packed version of a Romero's tale. That means the second thing you need to know: no social commentary, no satirical components, there's only some minor references to it during the whole film. And third thing you should know about this film is very simple: this is a great remake. But (and one must always remember this) this is not a shot-by-shot re- edition of a classic; it is a retelling of classic story for a new generation. It is, therefore, a completely different film, even if it uses legacy from the predecessor. George Romero made a story about mindless consumer society (with zombies). Zack Snyder made a story about zombie apocalypse (with some surviving people).",9,2,3,10 March 2015
Man of Steel," Zack Snyder Makes A Revolution In Superman's World
","This is Zack Snyder's first massive epic breakthrough with classic American superhero. Snyder's previous comic-based works, such as '300' or 'Watchmen' prove he's got enough talent for this one. And in 'Man Of Steel' Zack Snyder justified my expectations. Absolutely. So, what's so special in this new adaptation of Kal-El's story? To cut a long story short, I'll give answer in one passage: Snyder places Superman into the whole new stylistic universe, which is totally differs from classic movies of 1978-2006. It does not mean old Superman flicks are rubbish. It does mean only that Snyder radically changed Superman's representation in films, with a truly revolutionary passion. If one takes a look at good old Superman movies, there's easy to see that it has a much more light-hearted, even comic, style. It was a good films, especially first and second ones, but 30 years had passed, and we need a fresh look on classic story. Yes, we had 'Superman Returns' in 2006, but this one was a powerful homage to 1978's film, nothing more (and nothing less). Snyder's view is completely different. Sure, one will easily find a lot of hate from fans, maybe from critics. But for me it's not important, since I'm not a Superman die-hard fan-boy, or a snobbish film expert, who dislike film only because it's about flying guy with a large 'S' on his chest. I do love this movie, because I think, this is a great retelling of an classic story: more darker and realistic (say hello to Christopher Nolan!), but at the same time more deep than other Superman films. This is a Superman for modern-day America and for a modern-day world: surrounded by suspicious people, sometimes unsure about himself, sometimes lost and lonely, but with a great capacity for good in heart. Snyder gave us fresh - dark and perfectly stylish - version of Superman. So, thank you, Zack.",9,2,8,14 July 2013
Paranormal Activity," What's wrong with you, people?!
","Let me say it from the start: this movie contains nothing special and (that's the most important) nothing interesting. Then, do you REALLY believe all that stuff about 'real video evidence', 'actual police materials' and so forth? Don't make me laugh, please. I don't care about question 'is this really happened?' At this time I just wanted to see an interesting ghost story. This one is totally boring. One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. The problem is not the actors - they done their parts well. Problem is not the concept - 'home video style' movies could be very entertaining ('Cloverfield', 'Quarantine'). Problem is realization. The whole story absolutely boring. This is a movie about nothing. If you really wanna see good low-budget ghost horror - try, for example, 'Witchboard' (1987) directed by Kevin Tenny. Story's much the same but realization is much, much more powerful.",1,14,27,13 November 2009
It Chapter Two," It Ends Where It All Started - Tonight
","This is definitely one of the best Stephen King's adaptations ever, in terms both of style and faithfulness to the original source. Andy Muschietti did great work as a director, creating this long (probably longest horror film ever made), grim, intense and imaginative horror masterpiece.
The basic point is that second film is much complex and multi-layered than the first one, dealing with different albeit interconnected themes. On the outside this is a horror story about how adult members of the Losers Club join together once more to kill nameless monster they've encountered 27 years ago. This story has many spectacular merits on its own right: the images of It are very different, artful and scary. There's a lot of atmospheric moments, action sequences and monsters to remember. On the inside it's a story about anxiety and pain of letting the past go, which are inescapable parts of any adulthood as a process. But there's a bit of dialectic here, since the characters, intending to beat Pennywise, must keep their inner child to some degree, but within the framework of a grown-up experience. So, on the third level this is a story about the power of imagination, which can save human from evil, but in order to do so it has to be used with good hands and clear mind.
There's a slight amount of problems with this adaptation, however. Unlike the first film, the script (written exclusively by Gary Dauberman now) contains several plot lines which are unnecessary in the way they're introduced in the film; for instance, Henry Bowers' actions now add literally nothing to the main storyline. There's also a bit of jokes and one-liners overdose, which blurs creepy scenes sometimes.
But, luckily, that minor problems cannot overshadow the whole picture, which is still very enjoyable. Visit Derry, it's a great New England town. But beware of the red balloons. They're float.",8,8,15,5 September 2019
