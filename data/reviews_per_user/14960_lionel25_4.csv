Raiders of the Lost Ark," Old fashioned
","When I was a kid,I remember watching Indiana Jones again and again never getting bored... It has everything, great characters, story happens in many places around the world, it has the awful nazies... It was such a wonderful movies, but 25 years later i must admit that adventure movies have changed a lot and in a good way... The actors, the sets are less fake, in Idiana Jones the set looks like plastic, the actress is always screaming and drinking trying to show that she has some part in the story but doing nothing in particular... at least in our days girls have a real role, here in Indiana Jones she is less intelligent, less strong, she's immature... Awful ! No It was a good movie and sure it has a place in the story of cinema but I really doubt that new generation will watch it in the future as a godfather which will definitely still be watched in 50 years... note 6/10 for the nostalgie",6,5,12,23 November 2004
Beauty and the Beast," A tale on the possibility of being able to change and become better
","Even if the story itself can be a little controversial (a beauty falling in love with her tormentor), Disney's bring us here one of its best motion picture ever. Catchy songs, well developed characters (especially for the supporting roles), incredible animation, very romantic moments, a good drama, will make your trip into this imaginary world, an unforgettable one. Comparing to most Disney's movies this one is more 'grey' than 'black of white' and some may be scared that the message deliver is not clear enough for children but life is grey and rather than focusing on the tormentor part it is the idea of the possibility of being able to change and become better, the hope that this brings, that the Beauty and the Beast is all about.",10,5,6,1 September 2006
Wimbledon," A nice feel-good romantic comedy
","I've seen this movie when I woke up this morning before going to work and I was charmed by it. It is a nice feel-good romantic comedy, perhaps pretty obvious in its storyline, but with good performance (even Kirsten Dunst that I normally dislike was quite charming) and excellent tennis scenes enhanced by catchy special effects. Of course it is not as good as Nothing Hill because it lacks these unforgettable moments of pure humor and even if the characters are charming, they are not as colorful as the one in Nothing Hill, but if you want to boost your temper on a depressing rainy day, this film is highly recommended! At least it gave me the right support that I needed before leaving my cosy flat to face this hard day of labor.",8,2,3,31 August 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," Fun action scenes and... well nothing else!
","It s been a while I have not seen a great action movie with a lot of explosions, gunshots, fights, and cars chases. And honestly even though the scenes are pretty unrealistic Die Hard 4 delivers quite amazing moments. Of course Mclaine is more a superhero than a real human and therefore can survive pretty much anything, but after all everything about Bruce Willis special abilities was explained in 'Unbreakable' and the main purpose of an action movie is to show off and not to stick closely to reality... Therefore the main problem with this movie is somewhere else! The scenario! *****May contain Spoilers********* I mean even though it is quite unrealistic it starts pretty well with an organization because a very long and well planned plan has taken control the US computers network... And not just superficially, the whole TV network, financial network, traffic network, but not somehow the power network, they have to do it manually (after all why not?). But then after a nearly 'End of the World' start, you discover that their only reason for that is to get a ransom for some data! The bad guys offer to clear all the debt of Bruce Willis and set his children well off for their life, control the whole financial system, but do all this for money!!!! After this stupid explanation, it goes on an on without any logic from places to places, you discover that they where able to cut the power of by destroying the station but instead they lost their time in the beginning by do it manually. That the main bad guy can hack the best security system with a laptop but are not able to unlock a computer code manually... That the computer geek that they tried to kill so desperately at the beginning is useless (apart from the fact that he somehow knows the code of a very restricted area (I still can not believe this one...) And it goes on and on and on... In summary: the movie is enjoyable but you must switch your brain off otherwise it will badly affect the fun!",5,0,0,26 September 2007
