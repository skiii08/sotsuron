Marie Antoinette," beautiful
","Personally, I was only expecting eye candy and high fashion. And I got that, and more. People keep complaining how this was not in touch with the issues, how it didn't showcase France's political issues at the time--well of course it didn't! That was the whole story behind M.A... she had no grasp of what she was doing, what she was part of. The images, and colors, clothes, even the food--it's all beautiful. Versailles is amazing in person, but this puts it in new light. It's difficult to grasp what life was like then from the little audio devices you get when visiting the palace, and this really put it in place. I love the reflection on her life, and I loved seeing her in a new light, as opposed to being an inconsiderate woman, being a young girl, with no sense of reality, or anything. I loved how France's brutal, strict court is shown, and in general, I thought it was amazing.",10,8,13,7 November 2006
