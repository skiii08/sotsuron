The Expendables 2," Horrible. You are paying to see Stallone's inflated ego
","Movie was centered around Stallone, who happened to be a screen writer as well. The character distribution time was unevenly divided. No character development......none. Characters conveniently appeared when the horrible director best saw fit, but gave no justification or reasoning on how that character arrived at the scene. Cinematography might as well be compared to movies shot in the 80's.Statham was excellent, but given limited time. Arnold's catch phrases became repetitive. Where the heck was Jet Li? If you like guys with guns (most mindless people do) and killing then this movie is for you; keep in mind all the action looks fake.Reminds me of Indian movies where crazy scenarios and sequences are taking place, yet you just shake your head (no pun intended) because you know it's an Indian movie.I have more to say but it's not worth my time, so I leave you with the moral of the story. If the main star of the movie happens to be a screenwriter, producer, or director.... the movie will be centered around them and take away from the quality of the movie. Thank You Tom Cruise (MI4) for allowing Stallone to have confidence in making this trash again .PS....Seeing Stallone run was horrific.",5,19,32,17 August 2012
