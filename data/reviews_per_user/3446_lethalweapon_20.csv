Skyfall," A superb film on its own, and a decent Bond film at that
","The 23rd Bond movie packs quite a punch. The explosive beginning shows James Bond and fellow agent Eve running down an assassin who has stolen a hard drive containing details of undercover agents - a list similar to the NOC list from Mission Impossible. I'll just go ahead and call this the NOC list. By opening credits, Bond is accidentally shot and falls off a bridge to his presumed death.With the NOC list missing, there is a high pressure political upheaval around M and her division. The Government questions the relevance of MI6 as an organization, as they disputes its relevance in the modern non-war era (This ironically reminded me of how Judi Dench's M was introduced on screen in GoldenEye, where she accused James Bond of being a relic of the cold war)M is under political pressure to relinquish her post, after a terrorist attack takes out the MI6 building. This bit seemed nonsensical to me. 'Your division to infiltrate enemies and fight in secrecy is clearly obsolete, as evidenced by this terrorist who infiltrated our top secret Govt body in secret, in the shadows' is a rather thin argument.But of course, Bond returns, resurrected, and a bit worn out by his ordeal. He tracks down a thin trail that leads him to Raoul Silva, the villain of the piece, a cyber-terrorist who has a meticulously calculated plan.It is a very entertaining action movie, and a decent Bond movie. It's not as good as Casino Royale - but that's a pretty high bar to reach; It's better than Quantum of Solace - but that's a pretty low bar to clear.The Bond fan in me was furious that they did not have the gun barrel scene at the start of the movie. However, it was shown in the end, and the movie kind-of seemed like a tasteful segue from the darker tones of CR and QoS into the classic Bond series - with even the interiors reminiscent of the 60s Bond - so I am not complaining on that.My biggest gripe is that this movie showed far too much of Bond's past. I liked to think of Bond as a man with a mysterious past, orphaned at childhood and groomed by MI6 to be the lethal kissing/ killing machine he grew up to be. I like character development in a movie, but Bond was better off without his history as a baggage.We are re-introduced to the Q branch, which is headed by a nerdy young computer hacker. This makes sense in the modern era, and I can understand their need to move away from wacky gadgets. But their contribution to the James Bond gadget world were - a radio transmitter (low key, but fine... it's useful), and a gun modified so that it can only be fired by Bond; useful when you're facing the budget conscious terrorist who plan on stealing your gun and using it against you, but in a world where your enemies are able to buy their own guns, it is actually worse than a regular gun. Yes, through a curiously improbable situation, this stupid feature pays off once in the movie, but really, Q? Bond would have been better off with some Kevlar.I liked the villain's performance, but his plan seems to be eerily complicated. I don't usually give out spoilers, but what I'm about to say would be on the edge of spoiler territory, so skip the rest of this entry if you want to stay away from that. (Thanks for reading. Bye bye). The villain, Silva, is a former MI6 agent who holds M personally responsible for his imprisonment and torture by the Chinese, and his entire plan is to take revenge on M.Taking revenge on M is actually a fairly easy task. Bond sneaks up to her home without any problems when he 'returns from the dead'. To actually sneak up to a Government's secret military intelligence division is actually too roundabout a way to get to M. Even if we extend the storyline explanation and say that Silva wants to take revenge on MI6 as a whole, he could have done that by releasing all the names from the NOC list (He doesn't... He releases 5 names and then the list doesn't appear at all anywhere). And add to all of this, with the elaborate Joker-like plan of getting captured in order to escape (he needn't have done that. He only needed to let his laptop be 'captured' to set his plan in motion), he's just behaving irrationally. His plan also assumes that having a dozen or so armed mercenaries disguised as cops would be enough to subdue a top level judicial procedure involving the Prime Minister and other dignitaries. If you take a moment to think that this is what happens, then it really is an insult to reality. The British Government does look insanely fragile - It's a wonder they got by while Bond was 'dead'.And Bond's solution to this cybercriminal mastermind's tactics is even more bizarre. He drags M with him discreetly to his abandoned childhood home, Skyfall. He deliberately plants an electronic trail engineered so everyone except Silva will be sidetracked. This is the cunning plan to get Silva to attack him. But once again, if you manage to get three seconds to think about it, it just makes no real sense. People who can and want to help M would not be able to find them, but Silva would - so would all his mercenaries and other enemies who he can bring with him. By the time Silva locates them, he could have just shot a missile at the house and called it a day.Just because I'm nitpicking on all the available holes for this movie, it doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It was a very entertaining movie. It could have been better, though.",7,2,10,12 November 2012
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Evidently Feeble... But I still loved it.
","The Resident Evil series is about Alice, a survivor in a world infested by zombies, created by the evil Umbrella Corporation who is trying to experiment with weapons of war. In the first three movies, she was hunted down by the corporation, experimented on, given superpowers, and cloned several times until she becomes an all-powerful nature-controlling rapid-healing super-freak Rick James could have been proud of.Resident Evil: Afterlife starts with the Alice clones storming an Umbrella facility in Japan. In a brief, but spectacular action sequence, the clones manage to destroy the facility. By the end of this sequence, the clones are all killed and Alice's superpowers are taken away, making her 'human again'. Naturally, this is immediately followed by a plane crash.Now there are established rules on how a Hollywood action movie can show a plane crash where the central characters are directly involved. This is where the hero heroically tries to rescue the villain despite their oh-so-many differences out of the goodness of his heart, and the maniacal villain succumbs to the crash with a look of hopeless despair whereas the hero jumps out with some nicks and cuts on his right arm and left cheek.The rules are rigid. The hero may be replaced by a heroine and the villain may sport a maniacal sneer instead of a look of hopeless despair, but with this the flexibility ends. This movie, however, proves to be a maverick here. As a plot device, it served the same purpose as an eraser After the crash, the newly humanized Alice shows up walking in the desert armed with nothing but a sneer, two silver revolvers, and a bagful of makeup.During her travels she stumbles upon Claire Redfield, last seen flying off in a helicopter to parts unknown in the last installment. Claire is now suffering from temporary amnesia, and running around wild, with dirt encrusting significant portions of her face, clothes and hair. She attacks Alice for a brief minute before she gets knocked down cold. In the next scene, she is shown tied up as a prisoner in the plane's backseat. What got ME interested, however, were the events between these scenes. Because the Claire who was tied in the backseat had gotten a complete makeover. She had her hair done, face washed, clothes cleaned, and had apparently gone through an entire beauty treatment package. Apparently, Alice is a stickler for appearance. After she punched Claire's lights out, she washed her and her clothes, did her hair, and even applied lipstick. So the good news is that even though we can expect the future to be a grim host for undead zombies, prisoners are probably going to be treated quite well. Maybe the Geneva Convention gets stricter.But while she looks gorgeous and fulfills the horror movie hot girls quota, Claire is still plagued by her memory loss throughout the movie. The only thing she seems to remember from the previous movies is that during slow motion shots, she needs to heave her chest up and down in as exaggerated a fashion as possible, without looking downright asthmatic.The movie then proceeds to invent excuses for other action sequences a rooftop plane crash, a survivor's fortress, an invincible ax-wielding monster, a brief underwater chase, and an impromptu bungee jump, all enhanced by the VFX team. The zombies themselves were well trained, clearly well versed with the Hollywood zombie rules They walk with their arms outstretched, they never nip at each other, move as slowly as possible while hovering around the background, trying to peck at new victims, but move VERY fast if a chase seen is in the horizon. They never nip at each other, and for the heroine, they either graciously move aside for her to pass by running, or place their faces directly in front of her flying bullets.Pretty soon, Alice and her gang of survivors get to a ship called Arcadia supposedly a sanctuary for renegade survivors, but soon uncovered to be a front for the Umbrella corporation who were just abducting and experimenting on people Alice walks in to Umbrella's top secret floating facility and stares at the pristine, well maintained all-white laboratory-like space in the ship, markedly different from its gruff exterior, and moves on to see the villain smiling, seated, and waiting for her entry. Once again, what got ME interested, were the events before this scene. Apparently, the super-villain's concern for personal appearance was no less rigid than Alice's own. To be at the perfect seated location as Alice walks in, he must have practiced his poise and adjusted the lighting to get the perfect effect. It wasn't like he was seated behind a desk making notes/ drawing diabolical schematics for Acme products. He was seated waiting. That's dedication. Also, consider the pristine condition of the facility, and the fact that the impeccable white walls and floors hadn't so much as gathered dust. Add to it the fact that Albert was the lone mobile person in the craft. It tickles me pink to think that before Alice comes in for the climactic showdown, the megalomaniac super-villain must probably have spent his time dusting and scrubbing the floors.I like to think that he still had his apron on and brooms in hand as he saw Alice board the ship on some video monitor. Presumably, he then hurriedly hid the cleaning tools, changed to his super-villain clothes, and staged his sitting position in the nick of time.So with her humorlessly timed entrance, Alice engages the villain in hand to hand to bullet to dog combat. She apparently kills Albert in the end, but I wouldn't be surprised if he pops in for the next installment. All in all, I will put in a solid 4 zombie thumbs up for the movie, as long as you leave your brain behind. Not in an undead kind of way, though.",7,3,8,25 October 2010
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Delivers what it promises. Stupid, but entertaining.
","Just watched 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' (2012)History's not my strong suit, but I have this nagging feeling that they seem to have taken liberties with some of the historical facts here. ;)Just reading the title of the movie, I won't fault you for thinking how ridiculous the premise is. It's likely to be the first thought that would spring up, and I won't fault you for that, cos... well, it IS kinda ridiculous.But the title sums up the movie - the tone, the premise, the setting, the era, the genre, the plot. Never has a movie title been so revealing since 2006's 'Snakes on a Plane'But you should not be disappointed. If someone read the title of the movie (which is the least amount of pre-watch research you need to do for ANY movie), you can hardly be surprised at what you get. Unless you were forced to watch the movie at gunpoint, you don't really have a right to complain on this one. Abraham Lincoln is one of my favourite leaders, and I was wondering why they chose him as the subject for historic mangling, even if it's for fun. Of course, he was a physical guy, with a lot of energy. But why not pick out a fictional president? Of course, a story about a fictional vampire hunting president may not pull in as much bemused attention as latching on to a big name like L, seemingly pulling out the unwritten pages of history. But there was more to it. The vampire movement was linked to slavery, and Lincoln's presidency was a pivotal element of setting the slaves free. I'm sure they didn't select Lincoln because he was the emancipating president. I think they chose emancipation as a central plot premise so that the plot would fit Lincoln. In either case, the end product is a good watch.Don't get me wrong - the movie is as stupid and illogical as its premise. It has flimsy character development, sketchy plot, pointless villainy and unintentionally funny action sequences. But it's still enjoyable for a one time watch. And the special effects used in recreating the old era were quite interesting.The movie was promoted as Tim Burton's movie, but it's actually directed by Timur Bekmambetov. I was about to complain about the bait and switch maneuver here, but then again, I should have read the poster more carefully, I guess.",5,2,3,18 October 2012
Ted," Overrated, disappointing.
","Seth McFarlane's movie. That was enough to interest me at first, but the trailer made me go 'meh'. A wise talking grown-up teddy bear could grow old real fast. But then my brother reminded me that this could be like Family Guy's Brian, and that got me interested again. Finally, I watched it. And I had to go back to 'meh'. :-/Lonely boy John Bennet wishes against a shooting star to let his teddy bear, Ted, come to life. And he does. This turns his childhood into a memorable and fun one, as shown by a quick movie montage. But the trouble is that John grows up and Ted holds him back from maturing up.John and Ted lives a semi-juvenile life, and Ted's girlfriend wants him to grow up, and for that, Ted needs to move out. Hilarity ensues. At least, hilarity would have ensued, had the film-makers not tried to mix in a lot of emotional stuff into the mix not unlike poorly chosen toy stuffing. Not every film and theme needs to be grounded to reality - when your story premise is a talking toy bear with cotton stuffing, the reality ship has sailed off the horizon. The movie could have been fun. As it stands, it has a few moments here and there, but I wouldn't recommend you sit through it.",5,3,6,6 December 2012
Life of Pi," Excellent visuals. The best 3D visuals since Avatar
","The tale of Pi Patel, an Indian boy who grew up in a zoo in Pondicherry. The movie is shown as narrated to an author interested in penning his adventures. The main focus is on Pi's incredible journey from India, where he lost his parents and older brother in a violent storm. They were headed towards Canada to sell off their animals and start a new life, but a horrific storm wiped out the entire crew. Pi is stranded alone on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named 'Richard Parker'.The core of the story is how Pi manages to co-exist with Richard Parker in the harsh environment of the Pacific, with limited supplies, no help in sight, and unpredictable weather. The movie is an artistic delight. Fantastic visuals (The best use of 3D visuals since Avatar), amazing storytelling, good plot-line, and compelling camera-work. The narration was largely visual. With only one human survivor, the story couldn't be pulled through conversations. I expected a voice-over accompaniment throughout the movie, which would have been the easy way out. However, it went without the voice-over, like the 2000 movie Castaway - and this allowed the audience to drink in the vast emptiness and loneliness that perseveres through the movie.The story was interesting, but straightforward. This is possibly why the twist at the end of the story took me completely by surprise. I won't give out spoilers, but a subtle twist that leaves something ambiguous puts an entirely different shade to the whole experience. And that escalates the story from a good one to a truly excellent one.",7,4,8,6 January 2013
Lost in Translation," Slow paced, empty script.
","'Brilliant', 'amazing', 'fabulous', and 'breath taking' are just few of the adjectives attached to this Oscar winning masterpiece by leading critics and movie aficionados everywhere, which is why I have to consider the possibility that maybe I just didn't get it.Or maybe slow paced movies with nothing much happening in it are not my cup of tea. Or maybe - ironically enough - the movie maker's intended message and commentary got lost in translation. For whatever reason, I remain underwhelmed. It's the tale of Bob, a veteran, famous Hollywood actor who has is on a business trip to Japan, where he's commissioned to act in an ad for a Japanese whiskey brand. He feels secluded and lost in the city, and welcomes the friendship of Charlotte, a newlywed bride of a celebrity photographer, who is also lonely as her husband stays busy on shoots.The friendship blossoms into a deeper connection that stays unstated, but poignant. I have this feeling that this blossoming process is the central part of the movie that raked in most of the rave reviews, but frankly, I think even this part felt a bit forced. It's not the actors - they all do a fabulous job - but rather, the storyline that felt too thin. The entire movie is way too slow, but the pace at which the central characters get close - that seems too fast. Perhaps they could have put stronger focus on their connection... More time for them, maybe less time making one dimensional caricatures of the Japanese.But of course, that's just my opinion. Maybe it just isn't my kind of movie. Hmm... I never knew I had a 'my kind of movie' thing. :-/",5,3,5,3 November 2012
The Bourne Identity," Refreshing, thrilling, and one hell of an entertainment
","Ludlum would be proud. I expected a gun blazing no thought hardcore fast paced action zone, and I was wrong. This is not new grounds. Big shot with martial arts and weapons training loses his memory, and the people on both sides rush after him in a 'dead or alive' frenzy. Nobody to trust, nowhere to run, nothing to help bring back the past... seen it dozens of times, memorable ones being the hit flick 'The Long Kiss Goodnight', and Jackie Chan's version in 'Who am I?'.But there is something refreshingly new about this movie. The acting's great, direction is cool, and vfx is not unnecessarily flaunted. All I can think of saying is that I thoroughly enjoyed it. And the storyline is brilliant. What more could you ask for? The movie IS fast paced, but kind of slower than I expected. I'm not complaining, mind you! I loved the movie. It's just that I expected more. But there is a fantastic surge of excitement throughout the movie. I definitely recommend it, both for the casual movie goer, and for Ludlum fans, even if the plot is very different from that in the book. The characters were handled smoothly. A sense of realism surrounds the entire movie, except for a part in the central theme, which I cannot discuss without revealing the climax. Not that it contains much of a suspense.Jason Bourne is one character I'll remember for a while. The way he is represented... tormented bullet ridden castaway with one hell of an identity crisis, tortured at every step of revelation. He finds things about himself that he just can't live with, and even reaches a point where he doesn't want to know any more. The plot proceeds so casually and wonderfully, that you can't help but confess,'Well, yeah, I suppose that is the only step he can take.' It's like you know that in the situation given, the only logical and reasonable step to take would be the one shown in the movie.I give it two thumbs up. As soon as I stop typing, that is.",9,0,1,30 January 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," The greatest gift an artist can have is the knowledge of when to quit.
","The greatest gift an artist can have is the knowledge of when to quit. In case you're wondering, the 'when' part has been over about two movies ago. They say leave well enough alone. I plead, 'Leave a classic alone.'	I guess it is too late now. I understand some people are under the delusion that the matrix was originally thought up as a trilogy. Wake up. The Matrix was a masterpiece of imagination. It was a truly wonderful experience for the new generation of flicks. The last two 'installments' are just pathetic attempts at cashing in on the success of the classic.	At the end of The Matrix, Neo was supreme. Numero Uno. The people were happy. Neo was happy. Morpheus was happy. Trinity was happy. The audience was happy. But there came the flaw. It meant the end of the cash flow. No chance of a sequel where the hero is undefeatable, right? So comes the twisted attempts at reviving the old connection to our pockets. Neo's importance is lowered. The one? Pchaw... Lots of 'the one' s have come and gone before. Morpheus is reduced from 'the leader of the flock, the father figure' to a nobody with low credibility with the authorities. A dreamer spreading false hopes to the world that is Zion. Agent Smith is revived. More powerful, deadlier than ever. And the money machine spins again. Hurray Hollywood.	You shall note that I refrained from commenting on 'reloaded'. It left roughly half a million unexplained loose threads. I thought I'd better wait till I see the whole picture. I cannot regard 'reloaded' and 'revolutions' as two movies. Just one long pathetic movie. And now that I've just finished seeing 'revolutions', you know how many loose ends they've tied? Zero. Okay, so I exaggerated. So maybe they did try to answer some of them, but not satisfactorily. And they've brought in a lot of new strings as well.	For the love of humanity do not try to mix the last two flicks with the original. What is the freaking point of the story anyway? We are not shown anything of the matrix anymore. The matrix and all the billions of people in it... It's over. Kaput. No mention at all. Are we to assume that Smith copied himself into ALL the matrix elements? They have tried to pass off the oracle as a program now, apparently trying to explain how she knows all. In the original, you had to be content with 'blind faith for matters beyond our understanding'. A belief in a person who can predict the future. No more. Since 'reloaded', the oracle is a program, plain and simple. Yeah, right... They're creating more questions than answers. The oracle is now a program which predicts some of the future, a program sent into exile as a choice over deletion. If she's a program, the programmer, the machine world, can create similar programs to 'predict' the future, and hence foresee the threat that is Neo. But none of that. Ultimately, did the oracle know all that happened would happen? The oracle says, 'I didn't know. I believed.' As in 'blind faith for matters beyond her/its understanding'?
	And Mr.Smith, everybody's favorite agent, is now a self sufficient, malignant, all powerful free anti-Neo whose purpose is ... to end all. I loved the character of Mr. Smith, the agent from the original. The Mr.Smith program has actually grown in power to such an extend that he is beyond the control of the machine world and the real world. Mr.Smith also has the power to copy himself into the real world, in one of those bizzare loose strings I was telling you about. But Neo too, has the power to control (to an extend) forces of the real world. 	 	In the ultimate clash of the titans, where Neo and Smith face each other, it was so superficial that it was almost comical. Both character had been puffed by the writers up to such an unbelievable level that they just didn't know what to do. Oh, they tried their best to add colour to it. It just didn't make sense anymore. I'm not revealing the climax for the benefit of the lucky people who stayed away. But once you see it, think a bit about it. The next half million loose ended strings shall show themselves. Observe the vain attempts to try to make sense. 	I wouldn't wonder if they release a fourth sequel. It's very easy, when you decide the stories don't have to make sense anymore. It's not impossible. They might even try to make it like 'revolutions' was all just a dream, and try to explain that was how Neo controlled the 'real world' elements. I am being sarcastic, Hollywood... Let the cash machine stop here. Pretty Please. 	 	Neobe is the only new character since the original that showed some strong points. Weak, uninteresting, moot, and puffed up characters portrayed by some really lame over-actors filled up the rest of the 'new character' spots.	On the upside, the graphics are reasonably adequate, and the soundtrack is way more appealing than the 'reloaded' version. It is reasonably fast paced. Visual effects are okay. The one real matrix stunt with gunmen walking around the ceiling was great. In all, I'd give it a 4.5/10.",Null,0,0,6 November 2003
No Strings Attached," Bland, tasteless, predictable
","Two friends, Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher), decide to have a pact where they would have casual sex whenever they needed it, and not bring in emotional baggage and work that goes into building an actual relationship; i.e., sex with 'no strings attached'. This is one of three prominent movies around casual sex and 'friends with benefits' that popped up in 2011. 'Friends with Benefits' starring Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake follows a similar thread. 'Love and Other Drugs' starring Jake Gyllenhall and Anne Hathaway also apparently started out in the same vein, but developed into something between a drama around Parkinsons and a Viagara drug biopic. It was definitely the best of the three.For the most part, No Strings Attached is bland, tasteless, and predictable. I think Natalie's a very talented actress who usually picks good roles for herself, but this one fell flat from the get go.",4,2,2,6 January 2013
Quantum of Solace," Eplogue to Casino Royale, with a random villain thrown in for good measure.
","I'm sorry this review got delayed like this. I should have written about this last week, but I was busy getting murdered by office work. I knew you'd understand.As all Bond fans know, Bond has been rebooted since 2006's 'Casino Royale'. Bond is bigger, meaner, grittier, and doesn't smile much anymore. He has retired his quick quips and fancy comebacks, traded in his ejector-seat like gadgets and the wizardry department, 'Q', for sturdier plots and darker shades. He's no longer required to bed every woman that pops out from the corner of the screen, and that gives him time to focus on his missions.I do miss the old Bond. The raised eyebrows, the insane gadgets, the colorful villains, the larger than life action scenes and the double entendres that the writers graciously pepper all around the script. But I was pleasantly surprised how I liked the new version too. Casino Royale was the best possible way to get the new Bond rolling.And Quantum of Solace does not disappoint. I didn't expect it to overshadow it's predecessor, and I was right. It didn't. As the shortest Bond movie ever made, QoS seems more like an epilogue to Casino Royale. The movie starts off right from the tail of the last one, and it is almost certain that people who haven't seen the predecessor would probably spend their time chewing their fingernails in abstract confusion.We start off with a car chase that ends with the trademark Bond finesse, which basically reduces the pristine Auston Martin DBS into premium rubble. The better part of the plot revolves around an embittered Bond seeking revenge over his murdered fiancé, Vesper Lynd, and the systematic discovery and research on the mysterious and sinister organization called Quantum, which, you would have to admit, sounds way more cooler than the nemesis from the original franchise, S.P.E.C.T.R.E.I usually try to hide the fact that S.P.E.C.T.R.E. stood for 'Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion'. The name was a hidden shame to all of us Bond fanatics out there, though we wouldn't admit it under heavy torture. It must have been a pretty screwed up team who decided to opt for a name that had the words 'Counter-Intelligence' prominently lit up. Maybe the executives weren't intelligent enough to understand what it meant. I don't know.The new Bond doesn't use the iconic catchphrase 'The name's Bond, James Bond', anymore. Neither do we see his unstirring devotion to the shaken vodka martini. Instead, we are treated to the cold brutal assassin who interrogates his targets only after vital vocal chords are removed. We are shown that M disapproves of this tactic, possibly because of the practical difficulties in getting information from dead leads. But Bond continues to leave a trail that seems to challenge the grim reaper; everything he touches seems to wind up dead, including cars, planes, bikes, confidantes, lovers, and his career at MI6, though just for a short while.This is a Bond that bleeds, looks grim, and gets dirty after crashing his plane in the desert. The added touch of vulnerability makes the character easier to relate to and brings a new aura of tension to the movie experience.At the center of the current plot, we see a rogue environmentalist group seeking to control utility supply for a proposed new nation. Excited? Yeah, neither was I. Sure, this was disappointing, but this ultra-thin plot left a lot of room for very engaging subplots centered around Quantum, and I'm already getting impatient for the next installment.James Bond, meanwhile, seems to have picked up tips from his distant cousin, Jason Bourne. Foot chases on old terraces, jumping through glass windows to get to the the next apartment, rapid adaptation to environment, and cameramen who gets shaken and stirred during the action scenes all add a Bourne touch to Bond, and it suits the mood of the new Bond setting.We are treated to a few memorable chases, unfortunately balanced by a few weak ones. By the end of the movie, our debonair agent has of course, thwarted the villain, regained public favor of his boss, M, unlocked a few clues to Quantum, and expanded the dossier on items blown up.Granted, the central plot was thin, but I thoroughly enjoyed this installment, and I'm hungry for more. I'll give it a 3.5 out of a 5, and keep a look out for the next 007 installment. But until then, maybe I'll go stand in line for another watch of QoS.",7,1,4,13 November 2008
2012," 2012: A space for the ditzy
","End of the world predictions have been around ever since the the world had lunatics... and that's basically since the beginning of time. As predictions go, Earth has been subjected to the R.I.P. monitor on a periodic swing... The predicted cause of complete human doom has been postulated across meteor showers, volcanic doom, tidal waves, machine conquests, God's interventions, planetary collisions, overheating suns, underheating suns, alien invasions, nuclear holocausts, mafia dominion, ecological collapses, economic meltdowns, and, of course, my favourite... zombie takeovers.The new and improved doomsday alarm for humanity is set for the year 2012. This time, the nuts are REALLY sure about the date, because this is predicted by the ancient wisdom of the Mayan civilization. For some reason, these guys are seen to be the final word on stellar predictions and global collapse. And yet, somehow, they were not as great about predicting the inbound invasion that eventually wiped them out.But there's no dispute that there WILL be a handful of doomsday scholars out on the streets with cardboard warnings. And there WILL be money to be made from the pseudo-fear. Hollywood has marked the first major milestone with the release of director Roland Emmerich's latest blockbuster, 2012.The most refreshing aspect of the movie is that they categorically refused to put efforts in a plot whatsoever. The official motto seemed to be 'Plot schmot. Let's just blow stuff up.' Any time wasted on the plot is time they could use to blow up another global landmark. The movie was just as enjoyable as it was ridiculous... and that's saying a lot. They used and abused all possible combinations of CG... From the floods from 'The Day After Tomorrow' to the exploding landmarks from 'Independence Day' to the cars spinning on the road from 'Bad Boys 2' to the volcanic eruption and ash rain from 'Dante's Peak' to the drowned earth from 'Waterworld' to the flight-among-explosions situation from 'Air Force One' to the upturned ship from 'Poseidon' to the shattered buildings from 'Chain Reaction', to the lottery selection of survival candidates from 'Deep Impact'; they're all here. Now you can see why there's no room for a plot... and why you don't have time to miss it.The protagonist is Jackson Curtis, a rare combination of a limousine driver cum science fiction author, who stumbles on to a hush-hush government project that basically tries to save the genetically gifted and the fantabulously wealthy from the impending doom threatening mankind in 2012; A hush-hush government project that involves around 300-400,000 people in the loop; Talk about disasters waiting to happen...But of course, there's no time to ponder over that, as Jackson rushes off to save his ex-wife, their kids, and the wife's current boyfriend. This is where the roller coaster ride begins. Everywhere they go, the ground starts falling apart; buildings crash, the earth opens up, explosions flare, and general pandemonium follows them around for the rest of the movie.And, of course, all of the action happens around two inches behind the protagonist, as he flies, rides, climbs, swims, and skids across an unrelenting Earth. If he walks across the road, the road would collapse; if he jumps on a plane, the runway breaks apart, if he flies to China, the country disappears... Seriously, if he ever passed wind, it would light up. Danger was always that close... and you still don't feel tense.There is almost no real tension throughout the movie... Even as skyscrapers collapse and cities get wiped clear off, you just sit there and take in the CG works, marveling at the advancement in graphics. Cos you know, even though the death toll is literally in the billions, that by the end of the movie, the hero would just brush his hair, dust off his jacket, and flash a smile at the camera. Except John Cusack doesn't really smile very much, does he?Anyway, storm the theater. Enjoy the thrill ride. Pump more cash into Roland Emmerich's pockets. Live out the 2012 hype and get it out of the system, cos when the real 2012 comes in the picture, things are going to rather fizzle out. By that time, of course, Roland would be rolling in a filthy stinking sea of thousand dollar bills stacked a mile high, giving off high pitched squeals of laughter. Roughly, 2012 will be neither more nor less spectacular than any of the years preceding it.But then again, some insidious politicians are speculating that Sarah Palin would be contesting the 2012 presidential elections...Hmm... Maybe the Mayans DID know something after all...",7,0,1,4 December 2009
The Bourne Legacy," Not in the same league as Bourne. And works even less as a stand alone movie.
","I wouldn't call it awful... It had a few moments here and there - I especially went 'wow' over a 10 second clip where the hero climbs up to the second floor window to take out an assassin, shot seamlessly and in one shot - and Renner's performance is pretty solid.... but overall, it's kinda ironic that they named the movie 'The Bourne Legacy', cos it kinda disgraces the Legacy of the Bourne trilogy.The Bourne trilogy was one of the greatest trilogies of all time, in my opinion, and only recently lost out the spot to Nolan's Batman franchise on that count recently. Some people say - don't compare it with the first three movies. But there are two problems with that. First, they ASKED for the comparison when they took on the Bourne name. Secondly, the plot is intricately linked to some events in The Bourne Ultimatum. And by 'intricately linked to', I mean 'casually destroys in a nonchalant manner'.The action sequences feel different from the rest of the series, and I guess some people would like the departure of the shaky cam effect that become closely linked to the last two installments, but I'm not very impressed by most of the shots.The plot seems to be a bit lazy, for the most part. The hero, Aaron Cross, is an operative for a black ops program that uses performance enhancing drugs for its operations. The events in The Bourne Ultimatum has forced Edward Norton's character, who is overseeing all clandestine operations, to pull the plug on all agents. Aaron Cross survives, but the rest of the agents across the world are killed off by changing their medication/ missiles or other means. Aaron is the lone survivor (until Hollywood decides to spin off another side story, I suppose). The people after him (FBI? CIA? I lost track somewhere) are also killing off support staff - scientists who are administering/ researching the drugs - called chem in the movie. Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) is the lone survivor from the scientists group. A good part of the movie is on Aaron getting Dr. Shearing to a top secret facility that manufactures the drugs so that he can get a permanent solution to enhancing his skill-set.To counter Cross, they launch an agent/ super-soldier (I know, I know... I know they killed off all agents so as to not take any risks, but this guy is from another program, a deeper, more secretive program that apparently specialize in covert operations where creating a public spectacle is not an issue at all) There is a conversation in the movie where Cross is asked why he is so desperate to get the performance enhancing drugs. I really really hope I misunderstood that conversation. Cos the way I understood that bit, his poor intellect cost him back when he was in the army, and basically admitted that without the chems, they were both toast. Like I said, I really hope I got that bit wrong. And I also felt weird about some of the flashback scenes - where Edward Norton's character and Rachel Weisz' character suddenly have a short flashback of their earlier interaction with Cross - at a point in the movie where neither of them had ANY reason or cause to link to Cross at all. These flashbacks happen when neither are aware of Cross's involvement in the events at the time. Also, at another point, we see Cross hallucinating about his initiation into the program - at the same time that Edward Norton is reviewing the tape of this initiation. It's lazy/ incompetent editing at best.I don't want to give spoilers, but in the end, they unravel some stuff from the Bourne Ultimatum in order to create open threads they can close in the next installment. When the movie ended, I was thinking 'What? That's it?' There is not even a semblance of closure, no confrontation with the villain of the piece... or even his subordinates. If it were not for the duration, I would have thought this was an intermission, after which they would somehow wrap up the mess into a more tangible form. But no. It's just left there hanging, waiting for the green light to the sequels.I give it a 4 out of 10. It has it's moments, but a Bourne movie, it is not.",4,0,7,7 September 2012
The Dark Knight," Why so serious?
","I am now one of the scores of people who have been rocked on the edge by 'The Dark Knight', Christopher Nolan's continuing saga on Gotham's city's legendary knight in polyester mesh armor. Not only am I giving it both of my incredibly large thumbs poised in the upright position, I have been running through my friends borrowing THEIR thumbs for similar acts of praise.Why so late? Well, as much as I am a Hollywood nutcase whom some consider as a prime candidate for the reel-size looney bin, I am not the kind of nut who jumps in nose first in front of the movie line for the movies. I like to wait. My nuttiness lies in a different direction. I watched the movie just last week. I was having such high expectations that I was beginning to wonder whether I was simply putting too much hope on it Why so hopeful? Well, it's a movie by Christopher Nolan,who, as far as I can think, has yet been incapable of delivering a bad movie. His movie, 'Memento' had blown my mind away and had me canvassing for it so irritatingly that to this day, most of my friends figure I was being paid on the sly by Nolan himself. To add to that, 'The Dark Knight' had fished up a talent pool of amazing actors, including Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, and the late Heath Ledger, who were all legends of their own right, spinning the tale of another legend. I just had to find out what was up the bend Why so curious? The last Batman movie, 'Batman Begins', had such a unique spin on marrying the legend with ground realities that it was quite difficult for me to think how the story could be carried forward in the same vein. I had momentary bouts of doubts, but they pulled it off. And how!! I am familiar with the comic book version of the characters, and it is quite a feat to bring them, particularly the lunatic Joker down to a realistic menace. Jack Nicholson played an excellent version of the clown prince of crime in Tim Burton's 'Batman', but the menace was a caricature at best. That style and tone wouldn't have suited the Nolan atmosphere. And Heath Ledger made his final performance one that would last the ages Why so brilliant? Aside from the fact that his performance inspired me to spend hours tinkering with my photo to bring out the little Joker in me (I'm currently using that picture on my site), Heath has done more for this role than I could ever have imagined. The new Joker is no laughing matter. In this scarred apparition, we feel a rare grade of terror that is quite unsurpassed. We see the mind of a psychotic demented sadist; a performance rivaling even Sir Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal or Kevin Spacey's John Doe. The scenes of actual violence and gore, such as the actual administration of the Glasgow Smiles don't take place on screen, but we feel the hit nevertheless. His impact is so lasting that the residual fear you carry with you can make you shudder days after the watch.Why so tragic? Heath Ledger has underscored his performance as the Joker to be the last in his career. He passed away on the 22 January 2008, a victim of accidental OD. If he were alive, his career would have catapulted like crazy. Plus, I would have loved to see him return in the next Batman installment.Why so excited? You would be too, if you'd seen the movie. Right after I finished my first watch, I wanted to pen in my thoughts. I had to write. I had to share. I had to scare (So BOO!). The way the Joker interrupts the mobsters'conference and.No, dammit. I shouldn't reveal that. But it was brilliant. When Bruce Wayne had to go incognito to China and takes a no, no can't reveal that either. But trust me, it was brilliant. Just as brilliant as the final battle where the Joker. Aaaarghh!!! What in blazes? Isn't there anything I can write about? Not fair. I think I'm going to go sulk for a while.Why so comical? Hey, for the last time. This is not about me. Stop with the personal attacks. I am trying to be serious here.Why so serious? Yeah. You're right. Why so serious? Let's put a smile on that face! ;)",10,5,11,30 July 2008
National Treasure," Fun ride for the whole family
","Indiana Jones meets Dan Brown. Replace Benjamin Franklin with Leonardo Da Vinci and moderately correct American History with moderately correct Relegious History in the movie, and Dan Brown could have made another bundle by suing Disney.It is incredulous at most times, when Ben Gates solves 200 year old puzzles by thinking aloud for 200 seconds or less. And of course, unlike Dan Brown's novel, it does not really claim to be based on solid historical facts. It is a clear fiction, and a well delivered one at that. Too simplistic at times, perhaps, but I wasn't looking for an intellectual thriller. And you shouldn't either.But within its own genre, it delivers quite a package. You have history unraveled to reveal an elaborate scheme of hiding a treasure. A treasure so vast that it cannot be shown in all its glory. You have codes; clues leading to clues leading to an inviting adventure, to a promise of unimaginable richness that seem to elude the hero every time. Almost like leading a donkey by dangling a carrot in front of it. You have a villain hell bent on reaching the carrot before Ben does. You have car chases, a high profile theft, explosions, and riddles to solve. Everything the doctor recommended. But don't bother trying out the riddles. They don't really make much sense, and in any case, the hero will solve them before you can fully read it.Another objection is that the plot moves a TAD bit too easily, in my opinion. Just a little bit, but on the whole, the movie fares pretty well.Irrespective of whether the codes made sense or not, the codes were interesting. And as far as the hero's ridiculously uncanny ability to solve riddles are concerned, you may argue along the same lines about the Da Vinci Code as well. If you're really interested in codes, try and read just every EIGHTH word of this review and you'll find out what I really think about the movie.......Just kidding. But that would have been cool, what?",7,1,1,27 February 2006
Rango," Warm, mature, fun... esp. if you like old wild west movies
","Saw 'Rango' (2011)As a rule, I hate lizards... and even more so, I hate snakes. I hate snakes more than Indiana Jones. I mean - I hate them more than Indy hates them; not I hate them more than I hate Indy. I love Indiana Jones.OK... So to recap - Lizards, snakes... hate. But I still enjoyed Rango. It's a quaint animated tale of an ordinary chameleon who gets lost on the desert highway, on a search for his own identity. He wanders into the desert town of 'Dirt', a town that is drying up fast and whose people are loosing hope. Here, he adopts the persona of Rango, a dangerous wild west style outlaw. Through a series of quirky coincidences and sheer luck, he manages to become the town's sheriff, and becomes the beacon of hope for the people of Dirt.If you've been a fan of the old wild west movies, I'm sure you will enjoy Rango. It's well made, has a serious tone, but has a generous overlay of humor. if you are really turned off by scaly lizard images, maybe you should stay away. Otherwise, I certainly recommend it.",7,0,0,5 October 2012
Taken 2," Not as good as the original, but not awful either
","Bryan Mills' life seems to have taken an upswing after the events that unfolded in the 2008 hit 'Taken'. He has a better relationship with his ex-wife and daughter, his career seems to be picking up better, and he seems happier than he seemed in the beginning of Taken. However, the relatives of the villains he took out in France plans to take revenge. This plan comes to fruition once Bryan brings his family to Istanbul for a vacation. Bryan and his wife are kidnapped, and he has to instruct his daughter to locate him using improvised plans and improbable mental calculations.When I first heard that the movie was around Bryan talking his daughter through to tracking him down, I was disappointed. Taken was a highly improbable, but thoroughly gripping movie about Bryan's shoot-up- everyone-and-follow-the-body-trail-to-his-daughter strategy of investigation, and Liam Neeson is able to portray the hidden bad-ass like few others. But pushing the action to the daughter just took my interest down by several notches. Also, the reviews I got from friends were very negative. But I have to say that I enjoyed the movie well enough. It didn't have the pace or grip of the original movie, but it does decently well on its own. It's not a brilliant movie, but it doesn't qualify as a bad movie. It's worth a watch. (Hey. not making sense doesn't make it a bad movie, does it?)One nitpick - The first poster I saw for 'Taken 2' had the tag-line 'They want revenge. They chose the wrong guy'. No, if they want revenge, they definitely chose the right guy. They can't call for revenge against Bryan Mills and choose someone else to target. But I think that would be a decent premise. You know, some group of radicals are taking up revenge against a common man for... I don't know, something petty like cutting the villain off at an intersection. The villains mix it up and accidentally targets Bryan Mills for revenge. Of course, among rapidly piling bodies, they find out too late that they bit off more than they could chew. They can call it 'Taken 3: MisTaken'. Hollywood - consider that one a gift.",5,0,0,6 January 2013
The Sixth Sense," Absolutely Incredible. An enduring classic!
","I hate horror movies as a class. Did I say I hate them? No, no... I mean I HATE them. A barrelful of smart alecks running around with buckets of red paint. No coherent script, no decent acting, no sense of direction.... pretty much wraps it in a nutshell. There are very few exceptions. You've seen a horror movie that's good? It's not a horror flick! When I say these opinions, people always give some good movies' names, like Alien... Alien was a thriller. Not horror... Same goes for Predator, and Jaws. Debatable, maybe... but that's my opinion anyhow.The Sixth Sense is a fantastic movie. I've watched it 27 times to date, and I'll watch it again... I must say that initially I was not interested. I was not in the mood for the 'classic' and dragging story. I just kept my cousin company as we watched it together.Even in my state of partial interest, I could easily see that the direction was superb. Bruce Willis, as expected, gave a very convincing portrayal of the helpful psychologist. But I was short of appalled when he was nominated for Best Actor, and Osment for Best Supporting Actor. I protest. Haley Joel Osment played the centre character here, and Willis, legend as he is, played the supporting role. I was mesmerized by Haley Joel Osment. That kid took on the part that demanded maturity to an extreme level, and he delivered his part flawlessly. Flawlessly!It's really hard to see good child actors these days. Hey... it's really hard to see good child actors these period. And Haley proved prodigious. His performance cannot be equalled in the near future... not easily.Anyway, when the movie finished, my cousin, thoroughly impressed, said,'You weren't expecting that, were you?' I nodded no. We talked about the movie for a while, and he left. Immediately, I saw the movie again. I have great respect for Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan, and for Bruce Willis. But more than that,... for Osment. Well, that's all, folks. I got to while away the time. I think I'll watch some movie now. Hmm... The Sixth Sense Ought to be good.",9,0,0,19 January 2003
Looper," Novel sci-fi action flick; not perfect, but very gripping
","In the far future, time travel is invented, but outlawed, and used only by criminal elements of society. However, in the far future, the underworld has a difficult time getting rid of bodies, which are tracked efficiently by the Government. So they come up with a creative way of disposing bodies. They send an operative, Abe, back in time (by a few decades) to monitor a group of hit men called loopers. Loopers are contractually obliged to receive masked victims from the future; they lie in wait at a predetermined hour, rifles cocked and ready to shoot. In front of them, the victim suddenly appears; the looper then shoots him down, wrap up the body and cremate him, leaving no trace.The loopers are monitored actively by the 'Gat Men', who work under Abe to ensure that the Loopers stick to their contract. The loopers are paid princely sums, but accept an expiration date for their services in a unique way; one day, in the far future, his own self would be blindfolded and sent back in time to be executed. The looper is supposed to kill his older self, an act they call 'closing the loop'. (How that closes the loop is beyond me.) Once they execute themselves, they are retired from service with a heavy gold retirement package.The protagonist is Joe Simmons, who has been a looper for a long time. He faces his own future self, but is overpowered. Joe begins a hunt for his older self. Fast paced, novel, and gripping, Looper is a strong entertainer. I've always enjoyed Gordon Levitt's performances, and Bruce Willis, playing Gordon's older self, gives a strong performance himself. The story is well drafted, the action sequences are well done, and the story for the Rainman character is masterfully molded in the background. However, while I enjoyed the movie, it has its own flaws. My friends raved about the movie and heralded it as groundbreaking. I don't think I would go that far. The time travel rules established in the movie are clumsy at best. The truly great time travel movies generally stick to their own rules and make sense in some manner. Here, it seems to have superficial thought at best. The future self is affected by the actions done on the current person. In one sequence, the older self is trying to flee, but the Gat men are actively torturing the current self as this happens. They wound the person, and the older self gets a corresponding scar; they cut off limbs and the future self physically changes accordingly. This was a wonderfully horrific sequence, and built on to a gripping tension, but it just doesn't make sense. If such drastic changes are made, then the entire future life has to be affected... in this case, the implication is that the guy's future doesn't change at all even through something drastic as amputation.But if you can stop your thoughts from frowning at the logical inconsistencies, the Looper is a strong entertainer.",6,0,2,6 January 2013
Rockstar," Not worth the hype. An average movie with a jagged plot line
","Disappointed. Not that it is a bad movie, but it definitely doesn't justify the hype and praises it had gathered. It's the story of Jordan, a socially awkward wanna-be musician who cribs about not getting the right opportunity or the harrowing/ painful circumstances of life that would bring out the true artist in him. On the way, he meets high class socialite, Heer, who is engaged to be married and taken away to Prague.The story then focuses on the atypical love story that takes the characters out of the typical Bollywood comfort zone.The movie is poorly constructed. The severely jagged plot line tries to go back and forth in time without rhyme or reason, and further fails to develop the characters properly. Jordan's ascent into rockstardom is skimmed through... No, it's ignored almost completely. It would have been disappointing if this ascent just happened off-screen, but it's actually worse - The character change within Jordan - (from a meek dreamer to apparently selfish and indifferent) - seems to predate his stardom, and with that attitude, success in the music business is NOT something to skim over. The rise needs an explanation.Especially when you consider that his passion for music is not really highlighted in the movie, you can't just gloss over his growth as 'And then suddenly, he becomes a star'. It doesn't flow well.The music score of the movie has also been applauded far and wide. Personally, other than maybe a couple of songs, I didn't feel there was anything special about that either. I am tempted to say don't watch the film, but apparently, a whole lot of people liked the movie, so you may too... Maybe it's just not a movie for me.",4,2,5,6 October 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Surprising how high this is rated. It's watchable, but not as good as the 1st two
","It's not bad, but not exactly good either. Doesn't stick to the tone of the first two parts - makes things over the top and inconsistent. So it's off track from 1 and 2, but not in the way that it's exploring new territory... in sharp contrast with the Ice Age series - which built on the stories, remained consistent, and the stories, implausible as it were, broke new grounds in terms of plot...At the same time, it is linked to the earlier stories such that it cannot stand alone. From the get go, the plot and the characters are brought out as if everyone knows and remembers the characters and their adventures... It'd be difficult for a new-comer to grasp the story.The only plus over the preceding movies is that the animation has gotten better. But that was bound to happen anyway. But it's not 'unenjoyable'. It has its moments. Overall, it is watchable. But I preferred the first two.",6,0,2,5 October 2012
