Blade Runner 2049," Philip K. Dick must be turning in his grave
","The worst attempt of a sequel (?) ever to experience. Wasted 3 hours on a meaningless attempt to provide a sorry excuse for a plot. Slow & slow & slow, without logic leading to a complete waste. A warning and an advice: see the first & only so far 'Blade Runner', like I did for the nth time and stop wasting your precious time.",1,3,6,29 December 2017
