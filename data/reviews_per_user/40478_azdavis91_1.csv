Insidious: Chapter 2," Sequel On Par with B-Movie Scare Tactics
","Let me say that I really was excited for this movie. The first chapter was a breath of fresh air for the horror genre. Insidious 1 gave us a sense that we were witnessing a fresh idea that offered new, creative ideas for horror fans. Where did that creativity go for the sequel?I will say that this movie, if delivered properly, could have been the better film. What we were left with though was a movie that found a way to top its cheesiness every 10 minutes or so. It had comedic humor in places that was slipped into the script but clearly didn't belong. Aside from Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne, some of the acting just simply wasn't good, feeling forced in some places. Don't even get me started on the script that left you feeling lost for about 3/4 of the film. All in all I was let down by this film. Save your money and wait to enjoy this cheese flick cuddled up on a couch this winter.",5,5,10,14 September 2013
