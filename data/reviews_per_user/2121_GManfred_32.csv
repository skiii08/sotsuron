Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Look, Up In The Sky, ....
","Is there an age limit for modern movies? Or an IQ limit? I thought the first Sherlock Holmes movie was bad, and then I watched 'A Game Of Shadows' at a friends house. I must say right up front, I do not like the idea of Holmes and Watson as superheroes who can defy gravity and rational behavior with equal dexterity. I liked the more pedestrian movies of long ago with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce in which the two acted normally and solved mysteries.But there is another component missing from those films, and that is a coherent script. This is not the first modern movie I have seen which lacks continuity and order; it is as though movies nowadays have a schizophrenic quality wherein the plot diverts from reality and descends into periodic madness. Are Hollywood screenwriters now all on drugs, or just some?Well, enough. I have made my point and I am obviously outnumbered judging by the user ratings. I do think Robert Downey is one of the better actors around nowadays, and Jude Law made a better effort this time. I just long for some indication of the superior workmanship that Hollywood was known for and which began to recede in the mid 70's, approximately after 'The Sting', which may be the last great American movie.",Null,1,3,28 August 2012
Wind River," Off-Beat Detective Movie
","Bet you've never seen a detective movie about a murder on an Indian reservation. Well, 'Wind River' is one, even though neither of the two principals, Jermy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, are detectives. He is a hunter who disposes of livestock predators like lions and coyotes, and she is an FBI agent out of her element. She is from Las Vegas via Ft. Lauderdale and this is her first case. Together they try to solve the murder of an Indian girl who died of exposure on a remote part of the reservation. Although they are the principals, the real star of the picture is the reservation, vast, snow-covered and far from civilization. The overriding sentiment there is spiritual and financial hopelessness accompanied by bleak prospects for the future. The older ones are trapped and the younger ones yearn for something better which never seems to come. The story itself is interesting and absorbing but moves slowly until the eye-popping finale. The landscape is gorgeously photographed and makes the viewer wonder how the unmatched beauty of nature can be host to such poverty and desperation.",Null,5,12,7 August 2017
The Death of Stalin," ******* Hectic
","With pacing at breakneck speed, ' The Death Of Stalin' marks the end of the murderous dictatorship of Josef Stalin and the scramble to name a successor. There is no shortage of candidates, and cabals and conspiracies abound in this hilarious black comedy starring Steve Buscemi - and I don't use the term 'starring' loosely. He makes the picture go, and when he's not in the shot you wait for him to come back onscreen for the film to regain momentum.The film moves quickly and the picture is shot mainly in close-ups and frantic crowd shots, which will make it easier for TV audiences to absorb. Pay attention, since the pace and the numerous characters make for a somewhat garbled narrative, but just wait for Buscemi and you won't miss anything important. Or funny.My star rating is in the heading as the website no longer prints them.",Null,1,2,9 April 2018
The Hunger Games," 'Most Dangerous Game' Update
","Watched 'Hunger Games' with a friend the other day and it was another slog through the underbrush. That's the way most films made for the younger set turn out these days - uninteresting stories accenting form over substance and with inferior acting. But, since they're aimed at unsophisticated audiences, hardly anyone notices.This one is a variation on a theme that's been done many times in the past - humans hunted by other humans. This one has the requisite special effects and color process, sound modification, etc. but it is a joyless exercise with no heart at its core and no chemistry between the 'star-crossed lovers'.'Hunger Games' is no better or worse than most other big budget pictures made nowadays that lead the viewer to expect more than what shows up on the screen. It benefits from a big publicity campaign, leading you to believe that P.T. Barnum was right.",Null,2,6,16 October 2012
42," Bland TV Movie
","It wasn't a TV movie, as it was in theaters for a time, but that's essentially what '42' is, a movie made for TV. With only one recognizable star (Harrison Ford, excellent as Branch Rickey) and a bunch of no-names in support, it is remarkable it has as high a rating as it does. Or maybe not so remarkable, given American audiences renowned tolerance for mediocrity.In any case, '42' breaks no new ground and retells a story which is already out there. There are some racial insults, depictions of black/ white segregation policies and the challenges a black man with great courage will face. It is episodic and contains no emotional highs or lows, given the familiarity of the story and the tenor of the direction. Chadwick Boseman, who plays Jackie Robinson is tall and gangly, whereas Robinson had a stockier build, and missing was Robinson's peculiar pigeon-toed gait. It also contains innocuous background music - and I don't mean the great 40's songs played throughout the picture.You may like it if are under the age of 30 or are an undiscriminating moviegoer (no pun intended).",Null,8,13,2 August 2013
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Hyperbole
","I always enjoy watching Frances McDormand ever since I saw her in 'Fargo'. She is one of Hollywood's best actresses and doesn't disappoint here. She does the best she can with thankless material meant to be a combination of sensational filmmaking and a social statement, accent on the former.Writer/ Director Martin McDonagh tries to pull out all the stops via shocking dialogue and an over-the-top screenplay but ends up with a 5-times-checking-your-watch movie that seems much longer than 115 minutes. Also trapped in the pointless plot is another favorite, Woody Harrelson as the Police Chief, but he has to play it straight in this misconceived black comedy. The cast play foul-mouthed white trash types, but in the Midwest rather than the South. The story is an overblown polemic against small town small-mindedness and, true to form, ends with an unsatisfactory whimper, when another big bang would been within its already stretched bounds.",Null,8,16,27 November 2017
The Passion of Joan of Arc," One Of The Best
","Since it's all been said, I just wanted to check in with my comments on 'The Passion Of Joan Of Arc'. I saw it recently and I am glad I did so. For all movie lovers, this is a must-see. I will try hard to avoid clich√©s and corn, as many reviewers have already used the thoughts I wanted to put down - and I am a movie-lover not a movie critic.It is difficult to remain detached from Joan as portrayed by Ms. Falconetti. She gives an extremely sympathetic and powerful performance and draws you to her. You cannot watch her face without feeling as she does and this, combined with Carl Dreyer's direction creates the illusion of reality and the 'suspension of disbelief' is complete.I thought the use of close-ups was very effective, as much of the film is comprised of them, particularly the harshness of the faces of her tormentors contrasted with the softness of Joan's. I have seen one other of Dreyer's films, 'Days of Wrath', and felt the same stark realism and authenticity as depicted here. His films are more than character studies, they are in a sense soul studies. 'The Passion Of Joan Of Arc' is the depiction of a true-life tragedy brought back to cinematic life by superb filmmaking.",Null,1,5,29 October 2012
21 Jump Street," Should Be Rated R-14
","That's my new designation for movies restricted to young minds under the age of 14. '21 Jump Street' is one of the most sophomoric, inept movies I have seen in a long while. The screenplay was almost incoherent and the script was loaded with as many obscenities and vulgarities as you can find in a 112 minute picture, presumably to substitute for actual dialogue and humor.You know what? I never learn. I keep attending current movies after reading some reviews on our website, and more often than not I am bitterly disappointed. If culture and the arts are cyclical and a series of peaks and valleys, we are now in the deepest valley in history. The NY times Book Review section is thinner than ever, no one writes operas or any other kind of good music, modern architecture is an aesthetic wasteland and motion pictures are worse than ever.And so, I think this old fuddy-duddy will stick to the Turner Classic Movie station and FMC from now on and wait for an artistic upswing.",Null,5,13,19 April 2012
Baby Driver," Picks Up Steam
","Thought I had stumbled into another kids flick. I get turned off by loud, infantile music tracks but then the picture settled down and became a pretty fair heist movie with some grown-up tension and suspense. You know what also helped? The addition of Kevin Spacey as the brains of the gang. He rarely gives a bad performance and didn't mail this one in, either. Never heard of anyone else in the film except Jon Hamm.As stated, it gradually becomes absorbing and the plot which seemed outlandish 'grows up'. Lots of reviewers have rehashed the plot, but the actor playing 'Baby' doesn't add much. The film is saved in the acting department by Spacey and Hamm, who play unbalanced criminals (especially Hamm). Giving away my age, I thought the car chase scenes which were quite extensive and protracted, were overdone and not believable. 'Baby Driver', depending on your point of view and frame of mind, can be entertaining and enjoyable. But if you go, think young.",Null,3,6,23 July 2017
The Revenant," Field & Stream meets Outdoor Life
","Thoroughly enjoyed this picture, although I thought I would catch pneumonia before it ended. If this was based on a true story, I am surprised the hero didn't catch pneumonia; this was the coldest-feeling film I ever watched.In a more serious vein, I am with the majority of reviewers who saw 'The Revenant' and praised it profusely. It is worth every award it will garner and I wouldn't be surprised if Leonardo DiCaprio won an Oscar for his portrayal of the tormented trapper, Hugh Glass. DiCaprio continues to impress as a serious actor who improves with each picture he makes, and is on the threshhold of becoming Hollywood's best actor.By now the film has been summarized endlessly, but I just wanted to add one complaint, and that is that the picture is too long by about 40 minutes. This did not detract from my enjoyment, however, as I appreciate solid movie-making over lowest-common-denominator tripe prevalent on modern movie screens.",Null,0,3,11 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Vintage Spielberg
","Just weighing in but with nothing new to add. I agree with other reviewers, it's a very entertaining film that's hard not to like. sometimes I am struck by that fact that Spielberg films often resemble Frank Capra films in that they uphold a high standard in filmmaking and don't always rely on naked characters and buckets of blood. In 'Bridge of Spies', Tom Hanks has the Everyman role Capra used to employ. This one, in fact, is rated PG-13, which doesn't happen often in Lowest-Common-Denominator Hollywood.Tom Hanks never disappoints and an argument could be made that he is America's best actor. Here he is his old self, although a few pounds heavier than in previous pictures but an idealist in the James Stewart mold. Good supporting cast of unfamiliar faces and the story moves along at a good clip. It's all been said and I don't do summaries - read another reviewer for one. Very worth seeing, an oasis in a desert of crummy Hollywood movies.",Null,2,5,28 October 2015
Salt," ERA (Equal Rights Annoyance)
","Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a female Rambo-type butt-kicker - how commonplace in today's movies. Really, the whole 'GI Jane' genre is becoming repetitious as well as farcical. Here is another skinny chick with martial arts training, an assault weapons expert, an ingenious quick-thinker and all-around bad-ass who can hold her own against a legion of heavily armed guys. Give me a substantial break.Otherwise, 'Salt' is pretty good and with a twist ending that almost negates the rest of the comic book trash that litters the movie. She can jump from moving truck to moving truck, wipe out rooms-full of the heavily armed guys mentioned above, jump from a helicopter from an absurd height - oh, who cares. Maybe, as was mentioned, it would have been better with Tom Cruise as the lead, or maybe not. I just know that it's laughable with 'Ultra-Slim' as the star.",Null,4,9,18 May 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Labyrinthine Mystery With An Unattractive Heroine
","'Dragon Tattoo' is an excellent mystery movie with an absorbing storyline. I always liked mysteries with a time lapse involved, and in this one the murder was committed in the 60's. The time frame, however is contemporary Sweden and has an interesting premise; it was committed on an island connected to the mainland by a bridge, but which was blocked at the time of the murder by a car crash - no one got off the island, no one got on.Daniel Craig is investigating at the behest of Christopher Plummer, the patriarch of the family, who wants the answer before it is too late as he is elderly. Rooney Mara is Craig's assistant, a semi-autistic social cripple with a Goth look. Plummer adds immeasurable stature to the film and Mara has obviously worked hard to create an off-beat character and succeeds too well. I thought her characterization was off-putting and couldn't work up much sympathy for her, and that she detracted from the story, which as mentioned was first-rate.I didn't read the book or see the Swedish version of the film, but this picture was too long, with gratuitous scenes of the stars in coitus, and efforts to depict Mara's character as beset with troubles. Also, there is a back-story of a libel suit against Craig, which some people might find interesting (I didn't). I just felt it could have been cut down to a better, shorter version with additional editing, but that's just me. In movies I don't think that more is better. If they make movie versions of the other two books they should de-emphasize 'THE GIRL' stuff and just go with the mysteries, as this one was really very good.",Null,1,6,13 April 2012
Dunkirk," Harrowing
","Several times during the show I thought it was all over. I felt like I would drown or get shot out of the air and had to cover up as enemy planes strafed the rotting piers and the beach. That's the feeling director Christopher Nolan has created throughout 'Dunkirk', one of the most exciting war movies ever made. He sustains the mood for the entire picture, together with the drone of planes and ack-ack fire of machine guns and at the end you feel almost shell-shocked - or at least have ringing in your ears.Very odd, though, is the feeling that you have stumbled into the midst of an evacuation, which is pretty much the case. There is no beginning to the film to speak of, just thousands of troops assembled on the beach. Same at the end; you know the end to the war wasn't in sight for five more years. Christopher Nolan has made here the perfect war movie and is a must-see for WWII buffs as well as movie fans.",Null,6,10,1 August 2017
Now You See Me," Tall Tale For Teenagers
","Four smart-alecky young illusionists team up at the behest of an unknown mastermind to wreak havoc and revenge on some deserving individuals. Included in the the group is Woody Harrelson, who is not so young, but always entertaining in whatever movie he's in. They work for... maybe Morgan Freeman? or maybe Michael Caine?'Now You See Me' is loaded with plot holes and contrivances and, moving at breakneck speed, is tough to follow. It skims over obvious flaws in the narrative and, in the end, does not play fair with the audience. It is nevertheless a fascinating look into the world of magic, sleight-of-hand and hypnotism. There is, of course, the OCC (obligatory car chase), which tips off the target audience. Car chases got old shortly after 'The French Connection'(1971).The picture is energetic and good-natured fun, but don't look too closely. And bring ear muffs for the ear splitting sound track.",Null,0,3,17 July 2013
Non-Stop," Gimme A Break
","Liam Neeson is one of my favorites. I like almost any picture he is in. He's believable and has an expressive face that makes you root for him no matter what the circumstance. But 'Non-Stop' must be his weakest and most preposterous feature and it makes you wonder what was he thinking to accept a part in this crappy movie. The premise is extremely far-fetched and as the picture progresses so do the ridiculous plot devices, until the lame and surreal ending - but that was just the icing on the cake for me. Not for one second could any movie fan who had finished third grade swallow any of this drivel. I think this comprises enough lines to stop typing, as this wretched film has already wasted too much of my time.",Null,2,3,2 May 2014
The Favourite," ******Overrated
","Maybe I was expecting too much. I thought it might be an expansive, sweeping spectacle of 17th Century England. Instead, it was a dreary tale confined to indoors scenes, and with a trifling story. The director was apparently a stickler for period accuracy and detail, and here he succeeded brilliantly and seemed precise in costuming and custom. Acting was good all-around, especially Rachel Weisz as the Lady-in-Waiting to Queen Anne.But what was needed was a timeline and a sense of location. Characters seemed to wander around the Queen's estate at different hours and there is no hint as to the era, or even the year this film takes place. That, and perhaps a lighter atmosphere to enliven the proceedings. I thought it could have been better with a different director in charge.6/10 - The website no longer prints my star ratings.",Null,1,5,25 April 2019
Unknown," Coach, give me a shooter.
","That does it. This being basketball tournament season, I am calling a technical foul on the 'Unknown' bench for creating a confusing and convoluted screenplay designed to befuddle audiences and that is too clever by half. A scientist (but he's not) checks into a hotel with his wife (but she's not), gets into a car crash and becomes nobody. Got it so far? Didn't think so. From there on it gets confusing.Before we get even farther afield, let's just say that the picture is saved by the charismatic presence of Liam Neeson, who plays his part with two of his best assets, his sincerity and his earnestness. He is aided in his earnest sincerity by two excellent performers, Bruno Ganz as a dying psychiatrist and by Frank Langella as the 'heavy'.I guess it is worth seeing, and maybe you are quicker on the uptake than I am (I think it all started to come together on the way to the parking lot).There was just so much contrivance and improbability for a higher rating - but they at least had the right cast.",Null,1,3,8 March 2011
Gran Torino," Didn't make my day
","I am a Clint Eastwood fan, but not lately.He has decided to reveal a human side of himself - went to the Wizard and acquired a heart. He also revealed he is a wooden actor and a plodding, predictable director. Gran Torino is uninteresting at best and tedious at worst,worse even than Million Dollar Baby,and contains some of the worst actors ever subjected to the silver screen. I did enjoy the Christ-image at the end as he is sprawled on the lawn,which was an unintentional touch of humor. He says he is going to continue directing pictures and maybe next time he could hire a professional screenwriter.Speaking of directing, the Directors of the IMDb website should monitor entries more carefully.Currently, Gran Torino has an 8.5 ranking, which is a travesty.Since this puts it in with some mighty good movies,modern filmgoers obviously haven't a clue regarding what makes a good picture.Perhaps a separate category could be designated for films made after,say,1980.That might separate the film lovers from the dilettantes.",Null,20,34,17 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," OK Movie That Was Overlong
","'The Hurt Locker' was good. I don't know why it gets the accolades it did, but it was good. Jeremy Renner was good, also. The Academy went bonkers over this picture but, folks, it is somewhat overrated. It was too long and not as compelling as reviewers would have you believe. There was some action interspersed with protracted episodes of talking which did the picture no credit.But why was this such a tremendous hit with the media? I don't recall it was particularly anti-American. Unless I missed something it was , as I mentioned, just a good movie. Can it be that American movie tastes have become diluted and cheapened over the years? That's a loaded question, because the answer is YES.",Null,0,3,25 September 2010
1917," Terrific Picture
","Easily the Best Picture I've seen this past year - and it wasn't easy. Until this week it was at only two theaters in NYC, so you had to make an effort; it was worth it.After a little time to set the scene, the picture picks up steam and proceeds at break-neck speed to it's climactic ending. It starts right after Cpl. Blake gets his orders; go behind enemy lines and warn his brother's unit that they are walking into a trap, the hook being that Blake would try hard to succeed since his brother was at stake. From this point on it's like a roller coaster ride with no let up. I was exhausted at the end after the ordeal of the story. It's a war picture but it's also a story of survival, like 'The Revenant'.AA Noms could go to George McKay, who i'd never seen before, for Best Actor and for whoever designed the sets - they were perfect as well as authentic. It is a British production which is fitting as Hollywood produces nothing of consequence anymore.",Null,1,6,8 January 2020
Million Dollar Baby," Maudlin Dollar Baby
","Where to start. Difficult to relate how much I detested this movie. I think my biggest objection was the flop ending wherein the picture descends into bathos. About 40 minutes from the end the film throws out its anchor as the heroine dies a heroic death, and the film also drops dead. Hard to believe a veteran like Clint Eastwood would allow it to come to a grinding halt, but why not - the picture was handicapped by its inane plot and uninteresting storyline from the beginning. I was misled by all the hype and the big names involved, as I like Morgan Freeman as well as Eastwood. I should have been forewarned by Eastwood's last preposterous Oscar picture, 'Unforgiven' (1990). He is starting to show an unattractive tendency to pander to unsophisticated moviegoers, although it could be he's just aging ungracefully as a director.One of the headlines under the title page here on the website says that Eastwood is going to have another whack at Dirty Harry. We can only hope.",Null,4,10,2 July 2008
Cold War," ******* Wild Thing
","'Cold War' is just another example of why European filmmaking is leaving Hollywood in the dust; if you want to see motion picture achievement, watch an imported film. Problem is they're not available in very many theaters, and 'Cold War' is another casualty. In New York City it is being shown in two theaters, which a loss for moviegoers looking for something special in movies.Zula is an ambitious peasant girl with a restless spirit but is trapped behind the Iron Curtain. It 's 1949 in Poland and she comes to tryout for a Polish national musical troupe. She falls in love with its director who is looking for an excuse to defect to the west. He tries to take her with him but she is unable to follow. Years pass and they meet now and then on Tour stops. It is the saddest love story I have ever seen.Director Pawlikowski has captured the texture and feel of the post-war era behind and in front of the Iron Curtain - at least to my satisfaction, not having been there. Joanna Kulig is excellent as the beleagured Zula, a girl and then a woman tossed along in the rapids that is her life. The overriding feel is of separation and emptiness which is accentuated by the black and white cinematography. It is definitely worth your time if, like myself, you feel unfulfilled by current Hollywood fare.7/10 - Website no longer prints my star rating.",Null,3,5,11 January 2019

La La Land," Terrific
","Liked everything about it; acting, singing, dancing, direction, screenplay, etc., and it all works. Can't remember when I saw a more entertaining picture. I am a big fan of movie musicals and, strictly speaking, 'La La Land' is a musical, with some tuneful original songs and a few dance numbers. It starts off with a production number in a highway traffic jam - right off the bat you say to yourself, 'this will be a special picture'.Midway through it switches gears into a straight romantic drama, leaving the singing and dancing behind. By that time, though, you are thoroughly invested in the story and you hardly notice. Gosling and Stone are not known as singers and dancers but they get through just fine, he with a three day growth of beard and she with a Senor-Wences-hand-puppet endearing face. Writer-Director Chazelle has put together a movie which will draw some Oscar noms come Academy Award time. A rare picture with no apparent flaws.Just saw it again and it was better the second time. The 'No' vote crowd will be very disappointed at AA time. And, apparently, some 'No' votes have gone to every single high rating and voted No. What the point is, I don't know, but it's very coincidental and doesn't fool all the people, to paraphrase a Republican president.",Null,2,7,26 December 2016
Love & Mercy," Beach Boys Movie (minus the songs)
","I've been a big Beach Boys fan since the 60's. Love their sound and the energy in their music, so I can tell you how disappointed I was to find out someone made a BB movie and didn't put any songs in. Oh there were a few snippets here and there and several shots of their music in the making with studio scenes, but what a missed opportunity.I know, I know. It was supposed to be about Brian Wilson's struggle with mental disorder and drugs, etc., but let's face it - he wrote all those songs about cars, surfing and beach parties that captured the imagination of a young guy from New York and I was waiting to hear some of them. What saved the movie for me was John Cusack, who played the older Brian and who I enjoy very much. He did his best as did Paul Giamatti as his mentor/bully. Elizabeth Banks was great eye candy.Director Pohlad did further damage in my estimation by cutting back and forth between Early Years Brian and Older Brian too frequently. Just as you would get absorbed in one episode he would cut to the other one, and did it over and over. Ultimately it didn't matter, though. I was waiting for a song or two anyway.",Null,6,9,22 June 2015
Sicario," Alice In Wonderland
","Good actioner with the customary explosions and buckets of blood. It's about Mexican drug cartels and the DEA agents quest to break them up. Lots of good bad guys and bad good guys, the latter led by Benicio Del Toro, a Colombian hit man hired by the CIA due to his knowledge of the drug trade. He holds the picture together through the confusing narrative and takes it over towards the end of the film. He is excellent in his role.Not so excellent is Emily Blount who plays a local drug enforcement agent from the Phoenix area hired to lend legitimacy to covert CIA operations by signing off on whatever occurs in their localized drug raid. She doesn't know this, giving credence to my title. Speaking for myself I am tired of Hollywood giving us movies with scrawny, underfed women presented as macho-types who can shoot, punch and drop f-bombs ('GI Jane','Lara Croft, Tomb Raider'). Not believable for a second, and hampers my efforts for a higher rating.",Null,1,2,2 November 2015
Jack Reacher," Good Action/Mystery Movie
","Really enjoyed 'Jack Reacher', even though I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan. I haven't read any of the books but to my mind he did a fine job as Lee Child's omniscient superhero. A friend tells me that in the books he is supposed to be much bigger, and Cruise is on the small side, but it didn't matter. He is surrounded by a very good cast, including Rosamund Pike, Robert Duvall and, especially, the great Werner Herzog.Although there is a pretty high body count, the emphasis is on a mystery that, at first glance, isn't much of a mystery. A former Army sniper is accused of a random shooting in which five people are killed. He calls on Jack Reacher, who appears mysteriously, to aid his cause. As you can probably guess, things are not what they seem.I am not familiar with director McQuarrie, but he turns in an excellent job of moving things along - there is precious little downtime - and allowing the mystery to gradually unfold without a lot of contrived confusion. There is a thrilling car chase and along the way several baddies get their comeuppance. Does it all hold water? Don't be a killjoy. My headline says it all.

The Disaster Artist," Peculiar Project
","I wonder how many viewers saw 'The Room' with the real Tommy Wiseau, because that way you get the needed background to appreciate 'The Disaster Artist'. 'The Room' was a truly awful movie, so bad it has acquired a cult following and was riffed on MST 3000. I just thought this picture would have marginal appeal to a select audience.That said, I thought James Franco gave an astonishingly great performance as Tommy Wiseau, the Man With No Talent who wrote directed, produced and starred in this bomb for the ages. Franco is fascinating as the enigmatic, temperamental Wiseau and adds a dimension of vulnerability not apparent in 'The Room'. The film is based on the making of his signature movie, with some apocrypha added to flesh out the story. I still think you would have to have seen 'The Room' for context.But I wonder, though. Why make a movie about a lousy movie?",Null,0,1,20 December 2017
The Witch," Funny Farm
","William and his family have to find a place to live after they are banished by the elders, and find a spot in the New England wilderness at the edge of a forest. Little do they know that the forest is inhabited by a witch (what are the odds, huh?). Anyway, strange things happen in and around the farm. Since they are Puritans they can't figure out what could be wrong, since they are extremely religious and obey God's commandments. So they search for an answer.'The Witch' is well acted and pays great attention to detail, and to outward appearances recreates life on an early 17th century farm. The family's speech is sprinkled with 'thee's' and 'thou's', and, although the film is in color, it is washed out to lend the feeling of austerity and adds to the bleakness of the landscape. I thought Kate Dickie, who plays the mother of the piece was outstanding. Not sure if they give Oscar noms to actors in indies of this type, but if so, she would qualify. I also wonder if life on a 17th century farm was as lethargic as depicted here.'The Witch' is more of a melodrama than a horror film but there are a few scary moments. Speaking for myself, I get tired of trying to connect the dots of this type of movie, where you must chalk up natural aberrations and illogical circumstances to The Supernatural. The picture contains the usual defiance of reason which has no explanation except whatever you assign to it. And so you make a colossal effort to suspend your disbelief to make it all work. This is the second horror movie in a row for me, having seen 'Southbound' last week. 'The Witch' has better production values but 'Southbound' was more entertaining and moved at a quicker pace.",Null,0,4,22 February 2016

","I don't know. Maybe I'm too old for modern movies. I got roped into this one by my son (I paid, of course). Long story short - he loved it, I didn't.This picture was breathtaking in its special effects and in its director/writers imagination, but I couldn't buy it for a minute. There was no way possible I could, as they say, suspend my disbelief, no sir. I was born at night but not last night. I looked around the theater from time to time and watched as all the young people sat enthralled by the spectacle before them, and I wished I was 14 again. But then, I wasn't ever that naive and jello-for-brains, even as a teenager.But it was a spectacle. I loved the nearly non-stop action and hair-raising chases and near calamities throughout the picture. And I appreciate the way Leonardo DeCaprio improves with each film. He is sincere and a hard worker. I just felt foolish for getting in over (or should I say under) my head with the younger set.",Null,5,12,24 July 2010

","I saw 'The Woman In Black' on the London stage in 2009. Then, it was a two-man show, although the two men didn't play nearly as many parts as appear in this picture. The sets were very spare and I thought the whole production was a tribute to the ingenuity of the stage director.The movie, however, is like 'The Woman In Black' on steroids, with many added characters and a great deal more plot than it needed. Instead of creating the terrifying moments in your imagination, this movie is loaded with visual ones in almost every scene. Some are manufactured - movies today like to 'sneak up' on audiences with a sudden apparition accompanied by a sudden blast of loud music, which I feel is cheating. It gets tiresome after a while and I couldn't help thinking they had it right in the play; leave some of the horror in the audience's mind.The mood of the play was of an engrossing ghost story, related by one of the principals who lived it. This movie is a relentless downer - doom and pathos throughout and with no comic relief anywhere in sight. No one smiles or strikes a cheerful note and there is no uplifting message to be found. This makes it hard to find a rooting interest in any of the characters.Nevertheless, if you like scary movies, this one is for you, because it is one of the scariest I can remember. But see the movie first before you see the play, because the play will spoil it for you.",Null,2,4,29 February 2012
