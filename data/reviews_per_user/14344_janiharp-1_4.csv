Marie Antoinette," A Very Modern Adaptation of Marie Antoinette
","Marie Antoinette is a historical film based upon the novel and life of the Austrian Queen of France, Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst), wife of King Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). The young Austrian leaves her home, her family, all her belongings and even her little pug dog. Her mother, the Austrian Duchess Maria Theresa (Marianne Faithful), tells the young Marie Antoinette, 'you may have all the French dogs you want.' Arriving in Paris, Marie Antoinette is escorted to Versailles where she is married and a new life begins. 'Nothing happened,' King Louis XV (Rip Torn), is informed after their wedding night. After what seemed like a long time, nothing ever happens between the young couple. They are finally attended by a French Doctor. The young Louis has no desire for his beautiful bride. He is impotent. 'He has spent too much time with the stable hand.' It was said. King Louis XV, lies on his death bed and cries. 'I know what I must do.' After much coaxing from the Austrian mother, 'your life in Versailles is not secure until an heir is produced.' The marriage is consummated and three babies are born. I found the film to be disturbing--the guillotine is enough to disturb anyone. Marie Antoinette is blamed for the opulent lifestyle and waste of the French Royalty. At the end, Marie Antoinette sends away all of her mistresses as the revolution has begun. With a bang upon her bedroom door, the officer enters and states to the maids remaining, 'tell the Queen Mother, we can not secure her.' The Queen and King Louis XVI, leave in their carriage. They just drive away.Very modern adaptation of Marie Antoinette",10,1,4,1 December 2007
I Am Legend," I Am Legend, Science Fiction Thriller, It Will Scare You
","The movie begins when Dr. Kripper (Emma Thompson), briefly appears to announce her discovery, a scientific breakthrough and cure for cancer. She explains her discovery to the television audience and the television screen suddenly goes black. Three years later, Dr. Robert Neville (Will Smith), is the lone survivor of a plague that was released upon the world. Neville lives alone in New York City with his only companion, Sam, a German Sheperd Dog. Each day Neville and Sam go out on the streets of the city to hunt wild deer that have infested the streets and to scavenge for necessities. Each day Neville announces to the world, 'I am a survivor, if there is anyone out there, I can provide food, I can provide shelter, I can provide security.' At night, Neville boards up his windows from the outside world. You do not want to be on the streets of New York City alone at night. There are what appears to be mutant survivors. Their appearance is less than human. The only way that I know to describe their actions is that they behave as if they are infected with rabies. They are as wild and dangerous as a rabid animal.Neville is attacked by the mutant human species after discovering their hideaway. At this point, the movie becomes very scary. Somehow, he is rescued by what appears to be another survivor, Anna (Alice Braga) and her young son. The next night, the mutants come out again. They only come out at night. They have followed Anna to Neville's home. They attack with a fierceness that I cannot describe. The mutants are literally climbing the walls of Neville's home. Hanging from the ceiling and ripping the boards from the foundation in a wild frenzy. Neville, Anna and the boy escape to the basement of the doctor's laboratory. 'They are not going to stop,' Neville tells Anna as the mutants beat the laboratory door in. Neville puts Anna in what appears to be some sort of oven safe door and hands a vile of his blood which he has drawn. 'Take this with you to New Hampshire. It is the cure.' Anna believes there to be a community of survivors in New Hampshire. Neville closes Anna and the boy up in the protective enclosure, the mutant leader, continues to bombard the laboratory door. Neville pulls the plug on a grenade that causes an inferno killing them all.Anna and the boy go on to New Hampshire where they are lead in to the compound through protective doors surrounding the community. She hands the vile to her new protectors. Anna's last words were. 'In 2009, a deadly virus burned through our civilization, pushing humankind to the edge of extinction. Dr. Robert Neville dedicated his life to the discovery of a cure and the restoration of humanity. On September 9th, 2012, he gave his life to defend it. We are his legacy. This is his legend.'",8,0,2,17 April 2008
The Illusionist," Eisenheim, The Illusionist , Intrigues His Audience
","'The Illusionist' is a mystery from the early 1900 time period. The imagery is dark and adds to the mystique. I have seen 'The Illusionist' several times and I predict that this movie will become a classic film. Eisenheim, (Edward Norton), is a turn of the century magician living in Vienna. He is charismatic and his gaze is described as mesmerizing. He is called a charlatan and a tricker. His words are intriguing leaving the audience spellbound, asking for more and demanding answers from his illusions. One night, Crown Prince Leopold, (Rufus Sewell), brings his fianc√© Sophie, (Jessica Biel), to the show. Years earlier, Eisenheim and Sophie were childhood friends. It is their secret. She recognizes Eisenheim and contacts the magician later regarding their past. A love scene involving the two reveal their romantic tendency. Sophie then refuses to go away with the Crown Prince and it appears she is murdered. Eisenheim gives up everything and begins a new show leaving the grandeur of the theater behind. Before leaving, a mob outside demanding to know more, leads Eisenheim to confess to his followers. 'It is not real. It is impossible to speak with anyone from the other side.' Inspector Uhl,(Paul Giamatti), leads an investigation and all evidence points to the Crown Prince. I don't know if I like the ending. It reveals a twist in the plot as if it was all staged and I think the ending may be unrealistic.",10,1,2,27 December 2007
Downfall," A Nation Awaits Its Downfall
","April 1945, all of Germany awaits its Downfall. Downfall is called dramatic and accurate by critics. It is a film based upon fact and seen through the eyes of young Traudi Junga, Hitler's secretary. What the audience sees is the everyday lives of Adolph Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, amongst those that surround them in that infamous bunker during the final days. Hitler, with his many faults, appears almost human. A superb acting feat by Bruno Ganz, I am sure. The Russians invade Germany and bombard Berlin with artillery as the Russian Army circles the city. The bunker becomes an execution chamber for Hitler and his close advisors. The facts were horrifying. Many took their own lives out of fear of the approaching ferocious Russian Army. Nothing was more cruel than to watch Frau Goebbels kill her children as she cries over the loss of National Socialism. The film is filled with characters from the past and Ms. Traudi Junga tells her story with her own words. 'I must try (to survive)', Traudi tells her friend as they are separated. At the end, Traudi tells the world that she did not know how bad things really were or the extent of the damage. Fifty million people died before the war was over. It is a story that needs to be told. At the end, the names and titles are shown of the ones that were there, along with a brief history of what happened to them. I mention this because I think it is important to note that some did survive. The language is German with subtitles in English. The movie is a superb achievement and I recommend Downfall to all those with an interest in history.",10,0,1,3 October 2006
