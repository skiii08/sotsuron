The Sound of Music," One more goof that only makes me love it more!
","Part of the charm of one of my favorite movies are the little 'goofs' most of which are listed already on IMDb. However, if Georg's youngest daughter is five and his wife died seven years ago, how does that work? Anyway, I first saw this movie with my aging mom in 1965, and as the theater was almost sold out we had to sit in the front row. Imagine my feelings as the camera zoomed in on the top of the hill and Maria started singing. I was spellbound. Not until Les Miserables have I had such an experience! In most movies there are both strong and weak characters. In Sound of Music I found every actor and actress believable. Julie Andrews as Maria was marvelous, but the best performance in my view was Christopher Plummer as the Captain. How he changed from the stiff formal unforgiving and aloof parent to a warm and caring father in a few brief scenes was great. I have seen the stage productions many times and no one else has pulled it off believably. Most stage musicals have failed in their transitions to film for example ' Annie', but Sound of Music set the standard for future musicals to try and achieve.",9,2,8,24 March 2014
