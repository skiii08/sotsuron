Ghost," One of my favorite classic movies!
","Sometimes in this life in the Make-believe land of Hollywood, some moviemakers accidentally get it right...this movie is one of those moments. Even after 30 years, it is still being shone on the movie channels & I still need tissues for the tears every time I watch it. If that isn't a classic movie, I don't know what is....Everything came together magically in this movie. I can't imagine any other actors other than the late adored Patrick Swayze as Sam, Demi Moore in her very best role as Molly, and the amazing performance by Whoopi Goldberg as Oda Mae Brown., for which she deservedly won an Oscar. The plot was at the same time realistic but with a mystical element that makes the audience want to believe that there is a fairness in the universe. The direction & script was flawless. And one of the most important elements to me was the MUSIC! It was so beautiful & touched the soul...The selection of 'Unchained Melody' by the Righteous Brothers was pure genius...so much so that the movie will be forever attached to that song! Needless to say, I can find no fault with this beloved treasure & anyone who has never seen it is missing one of Hollywood's greatest gifts to its audience.",10,1,1,18 January 2020
Aquaman," Momma carries it!
","Only reason I wanted to see this movie was the leading man...Jason Momoa is the most gorgeous masculine male actor I've seen in a long long time in the movie business....he's right up there with Sean Connery...they both have that indefinable quality of extreme masculinity, body to die for, sexy eyes, sense of humor and the x-factor. Hollywood just doesn't have many of them any more. The plot line could certainly been better but the sfx were wonderful! And to have Nicole Kidman aboard was magical! My main gripe about the whole movie was the casting of Mera...ANYBODY, ANY FEMALE could have played that part better than Amber Heard...she is the most wooden, no talented actress I've ever seen in any role.. Any actress who doesn't have any chemistry with Jason Momoa, is a horrible actress! That was my biggest disappointment of the whole movie and the reason my review is 6 instead of 10.",6,1,2,27 October 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," A very rare gem
","As someone who loves great movies, I must say this is my first review only because this film deserves every accolade it has received and will receive throughout the years....it is a rare priceless gem, a shining example of film perfection...I don't think I will ever see such a great film ever again in my lifetime. Everything comes together flawlessly in the movie, the actors, the plot, the direction, the cinematography, all of it producing a film for the ages....if Stephen King never writes another word, he and director Frank Darabont have given the world an amazing gift in this film...A sincere thank you just doesn't seem enough but you have my undying gratitude for this movie.",10,0,0,20 January 2019
