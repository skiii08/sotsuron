The Longest Yard," greatest football movie i've ever seen
",holly this movie is sweet when they play the guards when they play in the mud they should make a part 2 my favorite part is when the great khali the guy who plays the big huge scary guy smokes bob sap who plays sperqouki . over all the movie is sweet and if you haven't seen see it and if you have watch it again. wow it is good isn't it its way better then the original just better last time the running back was not that fast so it was not to good but this one now its was good blew the old one to the dust Burt Renolds was a lot better at Nate Scarborough then Paul crewe cause at Paul crewe he was to serious not funny at all but Adam sandler very entertaining but then again Adam sandlers a lot more funnier then Burt Reynolds .,10,1,4,25 July 2006
