The Ring," Where do I start? **Spoiler Alert**
","There were more holes in the plot than a generic condom. The writers and the director just couldn't sell the plot to me. ...If Samara had the ability to do all these supernatural things, and she was alive for seven days in the well before she died, why in the blue blazes didn't she call somebody and say 'I'm in the well. Get my butt out of here!' I mean, think about it. That's what I would have done. I'll get even later, just get my butt out of here first, dangit! Screw that mystical crap. Get my butt outta here!!! I mean, why I am I going to make a tape, with all those stupid images, and take the chance that a moron gets hold of it and can't figure it out??? She can supposedly call someone and tell them they have seven days before they die, she can make tapes, etch images into wood, film, etc. BUT she couldn't send a message out to get her sorry butt out of the well???!!! Come on...Pretty much ends the movie right there, doesn't it? ;) Then it would be more akin to watching the rescue of baby Jessica on CNN than a horror flick...",Null,0,1,3 April 2003
Alien vs. Predator," A drive-in sleeper
","I've been a fan of both 'Alien' and 'Predator' films (but not the sequels) and the Dark Horse comics 'AVP' series. However, this film fell flat for me. I felt they tried to cram many ideas into the film and did not delve deep enough. I felt rushed. The way the movie filmed, granted it's supposed to be dark underground, it took away from the finer movements that were not clear because of the bad lighting. The fight scenes were to blurred too make them exciting. Also, had you covered my eyes, when the Aliens were screeching, I would have sworn I was hearing the velocoraptors from 'Jurassic Park'.
Pretty much I had to think the film in my head to 'enjoy' it.
Take a lot of coffee if you're going to see this.",4,0,0,15 August 2004
