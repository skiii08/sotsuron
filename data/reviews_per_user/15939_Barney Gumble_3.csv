Scarface," One of the best Al Pacino movies since 'The Godfather'
",Scarface is one of the best and most powerful gangster/drug movies I have ever seen.Its genuine violence and the excellent actors make this film a must see for movie maniacs. Tony Montana`s rise to power and wealth is a roller-coaster ride that is truly gripping. Despite the censors in my country who tend to hate it for being too violent and for its strong language I think 'Scarface' is a realistic view on the drug-business and its horrible side-effects.Thanks to Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone and Martin Bregman who made this film possible.,10,0,0,2 June 2001
American Psycho," Intelligent novel-adaption
",****************SPOILER******************************** This movie was one of the 10 best movies in 2000.I never thought that it was possible to adopt Bret Easton Ellis novel for the big screen. Despite the film lacks most of the sadistic and sick murders of the novel it is a smart and sarcastic portrait of upper-class life-style in the 80`s.Christian Bale´s acting as a high-educated but bored Wall-Street Yuppie who is looking for the ultimate thrill is brilliant.I recommend everyone to watch this. 10 from 10!!!!!!!!!!,10,0,1,4 June 2001
Schindler's List," This story had to be told!
","Schindler´s List is the most important film of the 90´s.Steven Spielberg´s masterpiece should be watched by every generation to remember and to recognize the holocaust.It is not just a movie that tells a story, it teaches history.For me it is one of the best examples for humanity and courage in a time when tyranny and barbarity reigned Europe.Even in Germany critics and audience were deeply moved and fascinated about the story of a German factory owner who saved his jewish labors.Our country has to thank Steven Spielberg for this film who shows that not all Germans were nazis.",10,9,20,7 July 2001
