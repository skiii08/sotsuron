Your Name.," This movie is incredible.
","This movie is absolutely incredible. I don't even know how to start describing this masterpiece.The plot revolves around a topic that has been dealt with way too often, but this movie manages to avoid the stereotypical challenges. Nothing about this movie is predictable which is an achievement nowadays. It doesn't play too much on emotions, but will make the viewer laugh, smile, and shed a tear.The music takes a real place in the narration, and is not there just to fill the atmosphere.The visuals are just breath-taking and bring a sparkle to the viewer's eyes.It was the first time I saw a movie made by Makoto Shinkai, but I will definitely try to see his other works. I am not used to Japanese animation, but this one is really easy to watch and the viewer does not need a deep knowledge of the Japanese culture to understand the depth of this movie, as the folklore is well explained.",10,4,8,8 January 2017
