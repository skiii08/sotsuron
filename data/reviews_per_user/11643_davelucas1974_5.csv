Casablanca," TheMovieFrog Reviews: Casablanca
","To view the entire review, please visit us at www.TheMovieFrog.com So, what do you write about a film that has been discussed and lauded for seventy years? Is it a timeless classic about love, loyalty, honor, and sacrifice or the greatest piece of corn-pone pro-war propaganda ever visited upon the American public? Well, the answer is yes...and yes. It is all of those things and more.It is, first and foremost, a classic story of love and sacrifice, almost biblical in the way that it is layed out. Lazlo is the Christ- like figure. He has sacrificed everything: his safety, his freedom, and the purpose of his life to the cause of inspiring others to rise up and fight the Nazis. The only sacrifice he will not make is leaving behind the woman that he loves. Ilsa is his inspiration and the thing that keeps him going.In turn, Lazlo's example of ultimate sacrifice inspires others to sacrifice for the greater good as well. His ability to inspire is demonstrated most dramatically and obviously in the scene where he leads all the patrons of Rick's in song. You can see in the faces of everyone joining in all the pain, fear, and uncertainty of living in a world turned upside down fade away to be replaced by a greater sense of pride and purpose. It is a very powerful moment in the film. However, this man's greater power is in how he impacts and inspires individuals from Ilsa, to Rick, to Renault. Rick has every reason to despise the man, yet it is not just Ilsa that leads him to break precedent and have a drink with the couple.Is the film a little corny? Well, yes, but only in the best tradition of the time. The dialog is fantastic, but when every other line is a zinger, it does stretch believability a bit. No city has ever been populated by that many people who are that witty that much of the time. Yet the wordplay (continued at www.TheMovieFrog.com) For reviews and more, please visit us at www.TheMovieFrog.com",10,3,4,5 April 2013
Citizen Kane," Citizen Cane Review
","www.TheMovieFrog.com Classic Cinema Series #2 - Citizen Kane #2Starting a review for Citizen Kane feels a lot like starting a review for Casablanca did. What am I going to say about the film Roger Ebert has dubbed 'the greatest of all time' that hasn't been said before? EVERYONE knows that this is one of the most innovative and masterfully constructed movies ever told. It was drastically ahead of its time in terms of cinematography, editing, sound design, you name it. But we all knew these things long before I started this article.I could certainly write a whole review about the acting, so naturalistic and understated for a picture of the time period. Welles is a revelation as Kane, with this marvelously smug yet confidential line delivery like he's talking down to you and honoring you with a secret wisdom at the same time. Agnes Moorehead is positively creepy as the loving mother who has completely turned her emotions off in order to do what's best for her son. Dorothy Comingore absolutely blows me away as Susan Alexander Kane, probably the most fully realized character not featured in the title. Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein, George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher, the movie is full of great performances. Again...we knew this going in.I could speak at great length about the film's groundbreaking narrative structure. We begin with the end of the story, then we get a brief overview that lays the ground work for the sub plot that creates the structure for the rest of the movie. Then we see different, shifting periods in Kane's life through the eyes of several different characters who all have their own take on who the man was. This may not seem so significant in an age where film makers like Nolan and Tarantino regularly turn chronology on its head, but these men owe a huge debt to Welles for showing them how it is done long before they were born. But...we knew this.I could write a piece in which the central point is that Citizen Kane is one of the most quietly busy films ever made, rife with symbolism. In the opening scene alone, we are treated to images of snow super-imposed over Kane's face symbolic of both an ending, and the story's beginning (which we don't know yet). We see the snow globe shatter, as Kane lets go of his... (continued at www.TheMovieFrog.com)",10,3,4,1 April 2013
The Bourne Legacy," Far Better Than Expected!!!
","The Bourne Legacy - Since his Oscar nomination for The Hurt Locker, actor Jeremy Renner has somehow morphed into Hollywood's new go-to action hero. While I would love to see him do something with a little more meat like that again, I grudgingly have to admit that I am beginning to really LIKE him as an action hero. His characters are smart and interesting and he never looks like he's TRYING to come across as tough or capable. With the parade of blustering buffoons that the genre has tried to push on America for decades, he (along with Daniel Craig) really stands apart as a subtler, more human alternative. And it's working. He contributed to granting Mission Impossible a far better relaunch than I had ever expected in Ghost Protocol and now he's done the same thing leading the cast of the newest entry in the Bourne franchise.Part of what makes Legacy work is that Renner is not playing Jason Bourne. He is a NEW character set in the WORLD of the Bourne films. Photos of the fugitive Bourne make it quite clear that IF Bourne appears with Aaron Cross (the new character) in a future film, the intent is still for Matt Damon to play that role. In this way, Renner is not forced to try and out-Bourne Damon. Instead, his performance is allowed to stand on its own merit, and it stands quite well.He gets able assistance from a stronger ensemble of talented actors than you usually get in an action thriller. Rachel Weisz, Edward Norton, Scott Glenn, Corey Stoll, Zeljko Ivanek, Albert Finney and David Straitharn all added to my enjoyment of the film. Oscar Isaac is particularly engaging in a small role. I've been hungry to see more from this actor ever since(continued at www.TheMovieFrog.com)",9,3,7,5 April 2013
Sinister," Sinister Movie Review
","www.TheMovieFrog.com Down with Sinister Lies! 0In today's crop of DVD reviews we reap the French equivalent of The Big Chill, another preachy film about failing schools & a horror film that was actually pretty good for once. Might as well dive in...Won't Back Down - You know, this picture has made me a believer. No, not about the problems in our modern school systems, I was already a believer about that. It has made me a believer that even someone as talented as Viola Davis faces great difficulty finding decent roles as a middle aged black woman in Hollywood. How else can you explain the two time Oscar nominee accepting this role in Won't Back Down? She does a great job (as always), but even someone as seasoned as she is unable to elevate this material into something more. Maybe they should have given her the Oscar for The Help while they had the chance.That explains her choice, I suppose, and actresses Holly Hunter and Rosie Perez haven't exactly been beating offers off with a stick the last few years either, but didn't Maggie Gyllenhall get nominated for an Oscar for Crazy Heart just a few years back? And she follows that triumph up with this film and Hysteria? I'm a little lost.I'm sure that when Daniel Barnz (who also directs) and Brin Hill sat down to write this screenplay, it was with the best of intentions. I'm sure that they really wanted to call attention to the problems of American schools, celebrate those who are working to fix it, and inspire others to do the same. They might as well have written a greeting card. What they've produced is an obvious and cloying message movie. Message movies belong on television as after school specials, but occasionally they get enough stars attached to them that they wind up on the big screen.The performances by the two lead actresses DO make the film somewhat watchable, but all in all it's a bit of a snoozer, unfortunately. To Ms. Davis and Ms. Gyllenhall, demand that your agents find you something worthier of your talents. This time, Don't Back Down...3 of 5 stars.Sinister - I have not seen writer/director Scott Derrickson's creation The Exorcism of Emily Rose but now I feel as if maybe I should go back and watch it. I love a GOOD horror movie, but even a Movie Frog like me sees so few of merit nowadays. They mostly go in for the gross out, replacing elements like suspense and mystery with blood, guts, and (cheap looking) special effects. That is not the sort of film that Mr. Derrickson and co-screenwriter C. Robert Cargill have crafted here at all.Sinister is full of suspense AND mystery. It has a sufficiently original villain with a credible back story. It goes for creepy more often than it goes for shock value (the slow motion movements of the ghost children who vanish in such a way that you can almost see them dimension hopping is a particularly nice touch). It takes some effort to craft interesting characters, and builds a sub-plot of family drama that actually works. It tells a real story that actually somewhere.Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a capable veteran actor like Ethan Hawke in the lead. He plays the part for all it is worth without ever going too far over the line. We share his curiosity, frustration and terror because it is always in reaction to what has happened. His acting never telegraphs what is coming; the viewer believes that he is just as surprised by every twist as they are. Relatively unknown supporting players Juliet Rylance (as his wife) and James Ransone (as Deputy So-and-So) also lend much stronger back up than you usually expect...

Les Mis√©rables," Best Musical of the Year!!!
","Les MostlyAblesI first discovered the stage musical version of Les Miserables at age sixteen on a trip that my high school theater department took to New York. It was love at first sight (sound?). I don't think that I have ever literally cried so many times in a few hours in my whole life. It quickly became my favorite Broadway show ever (okay, tied with Cabaret). Obviously, when it comes to musical theater, I pull a little to the dark side. Which is why I was concerned when I found out that Tom Hooper the (okay, yes, Oscar winning) director of The King's Speech was going to be helming the long awaited film adaptation of the play. After all, this is the director who turned a story about disability and World War into a charming little lark about an unlikely friendship and now he chooses to take on the bloodiest, gloomiest musical ever made.Despite my reservations about what manner of mood shifts Mr. Hooper might bring to the piece, I couldn't deny that he had assembled an amazing cast and my anticipations ran VERY high. Word that he was going to make the innovative move of having the actors singing live within the scenes rather than prerecording the voice tracks only fanned the flames of my excitement. 'So...', I hear you wondering, 'Did Mr. Hooper remain true to the starkness of his source material or fall prey to his schmaltzier tendencies?'. The answer, sort of dispassionately, is: a little of both to be honest.On the positive side, the choice to have the actors sing live was a rousing 95% success. One actor's lack of musical proclivity may have been accentuated, but the honesty of emotion that it lent to the rest of the performances is undeniable. Hooper was also able to pull some terrific work out of MOST of the cast, as he did in The King's Speech. The man is obviously a gifted actor's director. On the not so positive side, those with cinematically weak stomachs might want to take some Lactaid before viewing a FEW of the scenes. I'll just give one quick example. In the stage play, the song One Day More ends the first act as all of the characters join in slowly until it creates a tableau of the players that freezes with several members of the general cast hoisting French flags to complete the picture. While slightly contrived, this is an accepted convention of stage craft that works in that medium. In conversion to film, Hooper chose to show all of the individual characters singing their parts of One Day More in the separate locations where they would logically be at the time, which is great. On the final note, however, Hooper flashes to random French citizens hoisting French flags in the street for no apparent reason and then cuts with no segue whatsoever to what was designed to be the beginning of Act II, Scene I, presented after an intermission. This climax and (lack of) transition significantly undermine the inherent power of one of the most affecting numbers in the production.Besides a few cheesy directorial flourishes such as these, I really only find two faults with the film. I really hate singling actors out and he's already taken a lot of flack from almost every reviewer on the planet, but this is not Russell Crowe's finest hour (or two and a half hours, but why quibble?). Suffice it to say that this usually far more capable actor is horridly miscast, mostly because his singing is always strained and often slightly off key. His acting suffers as well in the struggle to over-compensate. My other gripe with the film is the Original Song 'Suddenly' which lacks the (abundant) inspiration so obvious in the original libretto. It was obviously thrown in just to garner one more Oscar nomination (which it did) and does nothing to enhance the already lengthy production.I'm sure by now it sounds like I didn't like Les Miserables and this could not be further from the truth. There is a lot of really good stuff going on. My personal affection for the source material just makes me very tough to satisfy completely. However, I would recommend the movie for exposure to the story and music alone. I have seen the film criticized for concentrating too much on the love story as if were some typical musical comedy but this could not be further from the truth. Les Miserables is no simple happy-go-lucky boy meets girl tale. Instead, it is a story about love can make the world a better place even in the most seemingly impossible situations: love of freedom, the love of a parent for a child, love of humanity, the love of God, and...yes...romantic love.
