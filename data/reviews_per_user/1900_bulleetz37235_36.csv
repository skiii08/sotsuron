The Devil's Advocate," Underrated?
","The Devil's Advocate is a great film.It is full of depth and intriguing story lines, that are impossible to ignore. Even a strict atheist like myself cannot ignore the themes presented, and most of all I can not ignore the interesting way in which it is presented.Beginning with Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) as a lawyer living in Florida. A prodigy, a man who has never lost a case, and now after his current case, in which he gets a sadistic paedophile off for rape, he's given the opportunity of a lifetime. To go to New York and work for one of the top law firms in the country, perhaps the world. With his wife Mary-Anne (Charlize Theron) in toe, they travel to New York so that Kevin can see what it would be like.He loves it. A bustling metropolis full of hard cases, and great rewards. Mary-Anne is also in love with the high lifestyle they are set to lead, and the prospect of being able to bring up a family.Even Kevin's boss seems too good to be true. The charismatic John Milton (The amazing Al Pacino) a slick, philosophical man of sly charms. At first, Kevin is given a few small potato cases. And he's quite happy with it. In fact he's enthralled, getting deep into his cases, and creating a strong relationship between himself and his boss. But all is not plain-sailing and peach blossom. Kevin starts to work more and more, and begins to neglect his new wife, who begins to freak out in her new surroundings, and her new home. Of which she becomes to be convinced is haunted with demons, and such beings...Poppycock? Not quite. Kevin is assigned a murder case, and after a couple of banters between Milton and himself, it seems that he still isn't willing to drop his work for his wife. He continues on, unaware of just how bad things can get, if you allow yourself to be overcome by your own, selfish desires. Even, Kevin's mother tries to make him see sense, and look after his wife, of whom before she had no liking for.He still doesn't listen...Kevin finally does win his case, and manages to get the murderer off the hook... but it's gone too far. His wife snaps. She claims that Milton had raped her, and in a particularly tense, distressing scene of confession in a church, in which she uncovers her scarred body. She is taken to a hospital for the insane, to try and regain her rationality. But before that can happen she kills herself. A final shattering blow for Kevin.And now, he begins to believe things are not as they seem. His mother addresses him about Milton - He is his father... and not who he seems, in the slightest. Enraged, Kevin goes after Milton, even at his mother's plea not to--- 'Behold I send you out a sheep amidst the wolves...'---She cries. He leaves the hospital... The New York streets suddenly deserted, in a surreal shocking moment - (28 Days Later Anyone?)He gets to Milton's penthouse suite. And the talk begins... Who really is Milton... And what does he want?Well, I think I've spoiled enough... I won't spoil this. Just take my word for it when I say that the following conversation, is controversial, quotable, and extremely moving. Great dialogue, crisp acting and fantastic direction... An eerie mix of fire-soaked settings and dragon-tongued discourse.Yet you may ask, why not spoil this bit. I've spoiled everything else. Well, the thing is, the film as a whole, from my conversations about it etc. Seems to be rather underrated. It lacks recognition in some respects, or so I feel. And so why bother advocate more for it when I want you to see it for yourself, and understand why the film is great. It is this ending that is the great thing about this film. Everything that leads to it is almost trivial. Necessary to the plot, and the outrageously good shock at the end, but still trivial. It is this scene that makes me think - why is it underrated? To be honest, I can't think of a reason -Some claim Reeves can't act his way out of a paper bag. And that Theron is just too overly weird. And that Pacino hams it up by going over the top...Well, personally I don't think so. I think each character has their own dimension, and that the overall film - (but especially the ending) - is most exciting.So I highly recommend this - I advocate for it, and give it it's recognition, before thinking about downgrading this magnificent work for such menial drawbacks---The film ends. Milton is chuckling... The credits role, to the sound of The Rolling Stones: Paint it Black.9/10",9,8,9,14 October 2005
Scarface," A true cult classic that will go down in history
","Pacino brilliant. DePalma damn good. From the pen of Oliver Stone. And backed up by some of the most shocking and memorable scenes ever committed to the big screen. It's a long one but still holds tough all the way through. It uses cheesy soundtracks to great effect, and backs up the carnage with glimpses of sentimentality, such as when Pacino (who plays the hard gangster Tony 'scarface' Montana) goes to see his family, and when he makes a stand in not blowing up the target car, because a woman and some children are inside, Sure he does actually resort to shooting his 'compadre' in the face, but it is admirable and a rather weak side that shows when he decides not to let the woman and her kids die. The fact this film manages to alternate between hardcore gore fests and compassionate scenes such as these means that there is more depth to the film, this depth is what holds a viewer in their seat. If it was just a three hour shoot 'em up, or just some three hour long romance epic it would really ruin it. Well thank god the makers got the mix just right and I can only really say two things about this film and that is. 1) It is Fantastic and 2)Everybody must watch it.",9,0,1,31 August 2005
Requiem for a Dream," Stunning.
","This is one of the most astonishing films I have ever seen. For starters, what a title. Requiem for a Dream, isn't that just the best sounding film title ever? I'll say it again - Requiem for a Dream, with a title like that you know it'll be good. And it is.Starting in Summer with Harry Goldfarb (A never better Jared Leto) stealing his mother's TV set to satisfy his heroine addiction it sets the scene for four people inextricably tied together in similar events. Jennifer Connelly plays Marion Silver. Harry's girlfriend who has been brought up in a rich family but yearns to be free, and so flees with Harry and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) as they try to make the big score and makes some money for a great future.Ellen Burstyn is brilliant a Sarah Goldfarb (Harry's mother). A lonely, old widow fixated upon appearing on television and on a diet so she can fit into her favourite red dress. To satisfy her desire she goes on diet pills, but as she faces more loneliness and fear of dying a nobody, she decides to take her diet into the insane and takes more pills than she is supposed to.Elsewhere Harry and Ty's drug deal goes sour with the street drying up with no means to buy and no means to get rich. They fall apart, and the midpoint of this film is the key part.With summer drawing to a close things start to turn bad noticeably, particularly in the scene in which Harry visits his mother. They sit and at first they have general chit-chat about marriage and happiness, but then as Harry realises his mother is on pills, and is grinding her teeth and being quite jittery through their effect, he says: 'Hey ma. You on uppers?' The camera swings inside, from what was once on the light side of the characters face, is now on the dark as the camera (ingeniously by the DA, and quite unnioticably - you must listen to the commentary) switches to show the darkness on the other side of Harry's face... It's quite a simple yet rather good technique, and the motive for the camera swing is quite elementary but the way it is pulled off is something else. Your average film watcher wouldn't have seen the relevance in such a movement, but now some of the motives are understood, thanks to the excellent commentary on the disc, it brings the whole rating of the film soaring. It really is that good, it is made with flair and imagination up there with the greatest of all film-makers, it is superb and original. It also sets the stage for the whole theme of the film, the notion of each person moving forwards as each one tries to hunt for their vision of happiness, but don't realise that by holding onto it so hard they lose their sense of reality and danger follows, and as summer fades into memory, the problems start to appear, and they begin to FALL. How far from their dreams they become is almost unbearable. But this fall makes for totally mesmerising and fantastic viewing pleasure. It is excellent. And the whole rise and fall is marked upon with fantastic skill. The contrasting, before and after is sublime.Set to the tone of the Kronos String Quartet and some excellent pieces by Clint Mansell this film is backed up by powerful direction which incorporates a souring mood that gets all the more sombre scene by scene. I can honestly say you won't find much better in the year 2000 and it is in my opinion the best film of the last two decades. Darren Aronofsky shows deep imagination in adapting Hubert Selby Jr's novel, but he makes the film his own, and it is a case of film being better than book. It is a truly harrowing accompaniment of fantastic acting, mind bending direction, shocking imagery, totally great dialogue and moods that have not been more powerfully portrayed in any other film ever. It is a true definer of the genre Drama, and all films of similar character can be judged alongside it. I suggest, beg and implore you to watch it and I tell you with total confidence that this is an absolutely, 100% bona fide marvel of cinematic perfection.Maybe I went too far, but I feel it. It's totally brilliant, on a great disc to match. If it was free on the NHS then it would be the best ever. :)",10,2,4,14 February 2006
Fight Club," How much do you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?
","Fight Club, contradictory to some beliefs is an amazing film.Edward Norton is our narrator. Whom I shall name Jack, as in the film he likes to be known. Sat high in a shut down skyscraper, a gun in his mouth with his 'friend' Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) splurting more twisted philosophy into his mind. From this point he regails us all in his chaotic story of events leading to this point in time. --- He can't sleep. As a result he sees a doctor who by chance suggests he goes to a testicular cancer support group to see what real pain is, even though he isn't ill at all... Physically anyway. Here he meets Bob (Meat Loaf), a big 'moosie' of a man who has developed breasts due to the cancer. And during the sombre meeting he begins to cry along with the others who are dying. After which he finds he can sleep, like a baby. From this he attends more and more groups, from Tubercolosis groups to Blood Parasite groups. And his tense insomniac mood dwindles - that is until Marla Singer walks into his life, and into the testicular cancer support session. A tourist, just like him. --- As a result, he cannot cry - with another faker present. --- He leaves the groups and becomes separated from himself, he needs to find a new salvation, and it comes in the way of Tyler Durden, a fresh hip young dude, with a twisted philosophy of freefall, and of sliding until you can slide no more. --- After the chance meeting on the plane, Jack gets home to find his condo blown to bits, and himself homeless. He calls Tyler, and the journey begins. --- After a drink in a bar, Tyler suggests a fight. They scrap, and soon after other men attracted by the brawl are asking to join in. Fight Club is formed, a hard-as-nails group of men lavishing in the simple delights of punches, sleepers and bare flesh. --- As Fight Club moves on and the group gets bigger, Tyler and Jack become renowned. Marla pops round every now and again, and Tyler and Jack go about their lives beating each other up, peeing in hotel soup and splicing porn into children's cinema flicks. Rebels with a cause, to hit bottom, to lose everything they have, so they can rebuild into better non-conformist individuals. As the twisted philosophy goes. --- It's quite a fast ride, full of memorable scenes, brutal fights and scathing humour. This film is brilliant, and makes you think all the way to it's glitzy unimaginable twist, that you won't see coming, unless you've been told before about it. Hopefully not, that will spoil all the fun and impact of this glorious production. And I won't spoil it for you. ---It's a cracking way to spend a couple of hours. A highly recommended film, that has high reputation as one of the greatest films ever made. I can believe it.",10,1,3,31 August 2005
As Good as It Gets," Under-rated for some reason...
","This may be somewhat under-rated as I expect it deserves to be in the top 250 but for some reason it doesn't quite cut it with the voters out there. I cannot understand why, reason be it that Helen Hunt puts a little too much sentimentality into her role that it comes off as unrealistic, or maybe Greg Kinnear isn't a convincing homosexual, I surely could expect any of these reasons to give less the score. Maybe some witless fool thinks that Kate Winslet should have won the Best Actress Oscar for Titanic, instead of Helen Hunt. All these maybes yet it all comes down to one thing. Is the film enjoyable? Yes is the answer, it surpasses this goal with flying colours. That is why I simply cannot comprehend a feasible reason to why it is not given a decent rating. Jack Nicholson is on supreme form. he uses the other actors like a drug addict uses cocaine, he sucks them in, he takes their surroundings and their feelings and gives a response or an expression that is brilliant, and that is so accurate that it is astonishing to think anyone could do this. It is a performance that is also hilarious, slow-paced yet a rather enlightening talent that makes me want to watch it over and over. James 'The Simpsons' Brooks directs with flair too, as he doesn't aim for the heart-felt close ups or the excessive camera shots of their surroundings, like what James Cameron tended to do for Titanic, he simply shows the stars in their most basic forms moving around and doing what would normally be likened to a soap opera. And that is this films defining characteristic. It tries to give off an atmosphere that says this is reality, this is realistic and it does it fantastically, except for the prolonged breakdowns that Helen continually goes into. I think that is why I give it a nine. I think it is a great film, except for the seldom moments of unrealism mainly conveyed by the 1998 Best Actress Oscar . But overall I think Jack makes the film come alive, and that certainly makes for enjoyable viewing.",9,1,3,12 July 2005
The Prestige," Watching closely?
","Hugh Jackman has come a long way. So has Christian Bale. Their acting talents are clearly on show in this awesome film.The Prestige is about two rivals magicians trying to better one another with a series of tricks that will lead to a fight for the final, ultimate trick. A trick they will be remembered for. It follows Hugh Jackman (Angiers) as he tries to understand how on earth his nemesis Christian Bale (Boarden) has created the 'best trick he has ever seen.' - The Transported Man... He desperately tries to imitate it, but can never seem to get it right... And soon it becomes clear that he will go to alarming lengths to find the secret...An amazing storyline, a powerful unique plot. An ending with amazing twists to die for. Realistic, dramatic performances from an outstanding cast... Including support from Scarlett Johanssen, David Bowie and the superb Michael Caine as Cutter... I really enjoyed this film...My favourite bit... May spoil it a little...Angiers has completed his diabolical scheme to defeat his rival... And Michael Caine confronts him. Before an amazing twist in the story comes, watch closely... Or you'll never spot it...They talk--- Cutter: Remember I told you what the sailor said about drowning? Angiers: He said it was like going home... Cutter: I lied. He said, it was agony.As dramatic as Brando's taxi scene and as conclusive to this film as I think you could get... Except of course for the brilliant twist that follows... Of course... You may know what I mean by this if you've seen it, and if not then oh well. Look closer next time...I highly rate this film, and only a little common sense in me has refrained me from giving it a 10/10 - Although it may deserve such a rating... Who knows?

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The funniest film ever?
","Dr Strangelove: or how I learnt to stop worrying and love the bomb is comedy genius.The film starts with a deranged colonel (Sterling Hayden) ordering a huge fleet of American bombers to attack Russia. His plan: Preserve American purity, by ensuring that the communists don't infect the precious bodily fluids of American people. After ordering the attack, he locks the planes out of reach, using a code. And then barricades himself in his office, with a nervous colleague - played by Peter Sellers, in one of three roles.As the pentagon gets wind of this, they try and devise a plan to stop the onslaught. Peter Sellers is president Muffey. And with the help of Buck Turgidsen (The brilliant Geroge C. Scott) he tries to negotiate with the Russian ambassador, to stop it. But, things are worse than they first thought. The ambassador informs the president of the doomsday device. A device, that will automatically let rip nuclear warheads, and destroy the world, if any attack on Russia is made. As the bombers close in the tension mounts. An armed unit is sent to the colonel's base to try get the code off him, with little use - this being due to the colonel committing suicide at the last minute. Meanwhile, as this is happening, we follow the path of one of the bombers, which is attacked, and sustains damage. Cutting off radio communication. This is bad news. As the colonel's colleague finally cracks the code, the bombers are aborted. Except one, the damaged one. And so --- the pentagon begins to worry, aware that there is nothing they can do to stop it, they can only hope that the bomber crashes... In comes Dr Strangelove (Sellers again, his best character) a maniacal split-personality scientist, whose identity changes from Nazi-German at one instance, to Russian citizen the next. They talk about the strategy they must undertake to ensure that if the bombs do go off, that they can still live.But... Ah, I can't spoil the ending. But rest assured, as tense, and serious as the film seems, it really is quite funny---Quoting:'You can't fight in here this is the war room.''Look at the big board. They're getting ready to clobber us.'---From the hilarious Dr Strangelove, the eccentric Buck Turgidsen, and the nutty-as-a-loon colonel, this film is amazingly funny, and poses a sly question, in it's anti-war themes. Isn't war. And nuclear war just so laughable?Well, I don't think it's up to me to field that question. But all I can do is highly recommend this film.",9,1,3,11 July 2005
Alien," Ultimate horror...
","Maybe the best Horror Sci-Fi ever made.Sigourney Weaver is captivating as Ellen Ripley. A commander on a spaceship called the Nostromo. It starts with a signal being sent from a far off planet by something unknown. So off the ship goes to investigate.They get there. Off go a group of astronauts into the depths of a cave to see what they can find. John Hurt being the unlucky one, as he discovers an odd organism inside an egg he finds hatching, which grabs hold of his face. But he ain't dead yet. They manage to get him back to the ship. Ripley however is against letting him in, saying he must be quarantined. But her crew ignores her and they come on board.After managing to cut the thing off his face, to find it has blood which is a powerful acid. They analyse the being. After this John Hurt comes in, seemingly okay. Until he starts to writhe and twitch. Suddenly as he lies on the table, his chest explodes. Literally! To reveal the ALIEN. A small evil looking critter that bolts away.Now extremely scared the crew organise a frantic search for the thing. As hours pass though it becomes evident this alien grows quite fast, and as one crew member is disposed of, it soon becomes apparent that it is stalking them. Ready to kill them ALL...The rest of the films is a mix of: The crew arguing about what to do. A few more getting picked off, with unbearable tension to boot. Ripley finding out that they've been sent just to get the thing, even if they die---'CREW EXPENDABLE'---And that one member is not even human, but a robot sent to make sure the mission goes as planned.Finally we have Ripley. The only one left, having to fight her way with this monster. Find out if she conquers yourself... I won't spoil too much of this. Although, this film is flocked with a bunch of far more inferior sequels. You can probably guess the outcome... Nonetheless, this film is spellbinding, and worthy of applause. It incorporates great special effects, and is one of the most tense horror films I have seen... Minus The Birds, Psycho and Silence of the Lambs.However this is excellent, and I highly recommend it. Especially if you like Sci-fi or horror.",9,0,1,13 October 2005
Taxi Driver," 'Are You Talking To Me?'
","In my opinion I think that Taxi Driver is the best film ever made. Really I do, and I think this for many valid reasons.1) The cast is so well integrated together that the overall effect of the characters is amazing, they have believable feelings and reactions to each other, and they carry the proper responses that real people would be considered to have, such as when DeNiro fantastically slips in professional fillers into his conversations with Betsy (Cybil Sheppard) or Iris (Played brilliantly by 14 year old Jodie Foster) and he seems to act accordingly to what is meant to be spontaneous speech, and the way he does this makes everything seem that more realistic, he also make for convincing viewing as he begins to lose his mind and buy guns and talk to himself. The slow winding down is portrayed to perfection by DeNiro and the more paranoid and more extreme his behaviour becomes, that little by little you know something big will happen but you don't know when, and it is this subtlety that makes it hard to tell when he actually became mad, it is feasible even to say he was mad at the start. It is this outstanding performance that he SHOULD have won the Best Actor Oscar in 1976 for this outstanding performance.Cybil Sheppard makes a believable love interest, and her interest in music and the finer things is seriously well shown through her sheer displeasure in Travis Bickle (DeNiro) taking her to a porno movie for a date. Jodie Foster is a 12 year old hooker who even though she hides her yearning to get out of the sleaze you can still tell she wants to, heck scratch that, you can tell that she needs to, via her occasional moments of jokiness and solidarity with Travis.Harvey Kietel and Peter Boyle also make for good support, and even Martin Scorsese is convincingly repulsive as the man who wants to kill his wife and her lover. 2) The story is totally unpredictable and original. The story is just mind-blowing, it is like Paul Schrader pulled it out of a hat or something, or he cut bits of one story, and bits of another and bits of something else and then glued them together to get a story of such brilliance and such suspense. It is this unpredictability that makes it so good. It isn't like an Alien sequel in which you know that half the crew of dick heads will get killed by the creature in some unimaginative way, and somehow one or two will end up killing it, or escaping. Taxi Driver is different in the way in which it is unpredictable and makes for compulsive viewing. 3) The quotes are fantastic. Things like - 'Are you talking to me...' and others that are quite astounding such as Betsy saying ' You're a walking contradiction.'This is surprisingly true, DeNiro talks about the sleaze and dirt he hates so much but indulges in porn movies. He claims to hate the trash that clutters the streets but his apartment is still pretty dirty. This revelation of identity is quite good to watch.4) The film has undertones of comedy, drama, suspense thriller and maybe even horror. It is a funny character study and is unlike anything else I have ever seen.These are the valid reasons and I think that Taxi Driver deserved more awards than it got, and should go down in history as a true cult classic.",10,1,3,14 July 2005
Full Metal Jacket," Eat your guts...
","Full Metal Jacket is Stanley Kubrick's vision of the Vietnam war.It starts with boot camp for marines. A tough, rugged training facility run by a harsh Drill Instructor. A man who regards his budding killers, as maggots, filth, grunts and worse. From Private Joker a brave man born to kill to Private Pyle a fat oafish dimwit under constant insult from the DI who believes he is worthless - to be honest he may have a point.By the end of boot camp however Pyle and the DI's demise is quite inevitable - A sinister ending to the training, with the ultimate last test... I can't honestly say if it was a pass or fail???With boot camp over, comes the war.Joker and his men are sent to Vietnam, and after a few rendevouses with bullets, Vietnamese prostitutes and a cavalry of gung-ho characters, the final mission, and final test comes. To secure Hue City, and kill the sniper in the buildings before they die first---'You will hesitate at the moment of truth. You will not kill. You will become dead marines, and then you're in a world of sh*t, because marines are not allowed to die without permission.'---The whole idea of being trained to kill, and to kill when you're trained seems almost to be like test for the men. And as I said before, I can't honestly say that in the final outcome whether it is pass or fail... Either way, this film gives a great impression of war, and is well created.I like the idea also that the Vietnam aspects of the film were made in my home country - The UK... I find that's quite cool. Sorry to deviate...Anywho, I recommend this to you highly. It may not be the best Vietnam war movie - Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter??? - But it is certainly memorable, and worthy of much acclaim.",9,0,1,31 August 2005
The Shining," 'HEEEERE'S JOHNNY!!!'... Brilliant.
","This is the best directed film ever made. The style used by Stanley Kubrick is always fantastic but for this film I think he overwhelmed all expectations, he uses the camera with such eerie bluntness that the effects are astounding. The props are unbelievable and I just cannot comprehend how dedicated he must have been to take over 60 shoots for some of his scenes, and also how he could have been bothered to use the huge prop of reams and reams of paper that read 'All work and no play make Jack a dull boy' in many different styles, this must have taken a lot of persistence to have carried on writing it.Jack Nicholson plays his part to perfection, as the winter caretaker of an isolated hotel in the Rocky Mountains, in which the mysterious ghosts and other supernatural inhabitants begin to take over his soul and turn him against his family, in which to the latter part of the film he tries to murder. His family is played brilliantly too by Shelley Duvall and 5 year old Danny Lloyd as his son who possesses a special ability of telepathy in which he can communicate over long distances through his mind, this is The Shining. The direction is well highlighted by these two actors as it seems that they abandon completely what would normally be an impulse to laugh, in exchange for believable, realistic seeming terror. It is fantastic.Scatman Crothers makes a dignified approach as a man facing the horrors of the overlook hotel, and a man who feels deeply for his Shining friend who is trapped amongst the horrible images of the overlook that only he can see, for whom he must save from the forces at work.Philip Stone is also brilliant as a previous caretaker in which the hotel has claimed, and he goes around persuading Jack to revolt against his family. Joe Turkel is Lloyd the barman and he pulls of one of the most eerie performances in the film as he uses calm and collected wordage to encourage Jack to sell his soul for the drink he craves, that will send him back to his old violent ways, and ensure that the hotel claims the most powerful and important soul of all, his son Danny, The Shiner.With a brilliant script loosely adapted from a Stephen king bestseller, this film uses the material to perfection, yet does not copy it outright. It uses the eerie surroundings of the ornate hotel to create the best atmosphere of any horror film ever and it is this atmosphere, that is backed up by the best horror film soundtrack of all time.Honestly if you have not seen it and you want to scream, and at the same time be overwhelmed by the originality of the blunt direction, then get this film watch it and I guarantee you WILL enjoy it, with its most memorable quotes and most fantastic acting quality I can definitely say this is the best directed film and best horror film ever made. Hail Stanley Kubrick, for this he shall always be remembered.",10,1,2,12 July 2005
American Beauty," Beautiful
","'My name is Lester Burnham. I'm 42 years old. In less than a year I will be dead. Of course I don't know this, and in a way I am already.'Quaint American suburbia. Quaint American life. Lester. The husband and father (Kevin Spacey - Oscar winning, if that matters to you), an advertising worker. A man who's had enough of the smart suit lifestyle, and the orderly existence he must lead. Of whom, after a chance sighting of a gorgeous high-school cheerleader decides to abruptly alter his life, to make himself happy. Carolyn. The wife and mother (Annette Benning), a real estate agent, feeling the squeeze from the competition who must find her way into the exec's business. A woman who is frustrated with her loveless marriage, who resorts to adultery. And of whom is wanting to change as well, not via regression as her husband has done, but with re-order to her waining, uncontrolled existence. Jane. The teenage daughter (Thora Birch), high-school student, best friends with the cheerleading hottie of which her father has a crush. A mixed-up badly parented so-and-so who has the new boy next door hitting on her, and her best friend constantly impressing her 'apparent' sexual experiences on her. As you may or may not expect.So there's the family. The film follows: Lester's regression Carolyn's disjointedness with her family Jane' despising attitude towards them both The new neighbours, of whom: The father is an ex-marine who is unhappy about his son's antics with Jane's father... The son, a troubled, ex-loon who is trying to find his way through society by focussing on the beauty, the tenderness, the good stuff in a world we might find to be anything but. The mother - A wreck? That's all that can be said about her.The film is quirky, a bit predictable, but always entertaining, with some memorable pieces and a lovely look to it, Sam Mendes really did the job proud. Of course, the ending can be seen a mile away. The first line of the film prepares you straight out - Noted above ^ in speech marks.But for what the intertwining, oddly attractive lives of these people tells us, it is fine to say that this film is a contemporary, enjoyable - and sometimes funny - delight of cinematic wonder.",9,1,4,1 September 2005
Apocalypse Now," Make sure it's Redux
","This is a classic war movie. One of the best, a stark image fest of flashing lights, harrowing dark backgrounds and helicopter blades morphing into ceiling fans. A star-studded spectacle of immense power.Martin Sheen is a mercenary sent up river to assassinate the general gone astray, a sadistic dictator played beyond belief by the great Marlon Brando. Also along for the ride are, Robert Duvall as an over the top DI with a penchant for 'napalm in the morning' or at least the smell of it. Dennis Hopper is an edgy photojournalist with a view slanted views about the war and about his leader. Also in this amazing film you'll see up and coming stars such as Laurence Fishburne, R. Lee Ermey, Sam Bottoms, Albert Hall and keep an eye out for Harrison Ford too...Behind the lens is Francis Ford Coppolla delivering a film with maybe more intensity and drama than the acclaimed Godfather films, he highlights war in it's most basic form, which for the most part is something you can't see, you can only feel it, as the boat carries on up river the feeling of the war tightening in is quite unbearable. The feeling of this is a rather claustrophobic feeling and really makes for unusual moods from the viewers. Honestly no films has ever made me feel like that.Criticism is hard to find. The biggest qualm from some is that Brando earned tons of money for a ten minute role, but in all fairness this is unjustified. It was money well earned, a role that physically restricted him, being at the time an unwell man, and a role that he really made his own. I can't picture anyone better for the role. And if you get the Apocalypse Now Redux version, there's some extra bits of the great man, and I think the Redux does make the film miles better.Final impressions are that if you are lucky to get the Redux version then you will be blessed with a completely satisfying film with a cool 49 minutes extra footage. If not, then still you won't be disappointed, this film is up there with the best, and deserves some great recognition, and a firm place as one of the top 50 films ever made...",9,4,5,9 March 2006
American History X," Provocative
","American History X is a film that on first impression is artistic, yet quite touchy. It raises themes that you don't really want to watch. Racism, violence and segregation - to name a few.The story is about the Vinyard family. And their involvement with Neo-Nazi racism groups. Derek Vinyard (The ever-fabulous Edward Norton) is the main man. A tough rogue filled with hatred and bitterness against other races, and convinced he must fight against them as a white protestant male. Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) is his brother, an impressionable teen who admires his brother above all others.---The story is harsh though, and told in very interesting ways. Part of it is flashback, part of it present time, part of it is narration by Norton telling of his time spent in prison, for the murder of a black man. And even more imaginative is the way in which events surrounding the racial antagonism are commented and shown via an essay of which Danny is forced to write for the principal of his school, an essay for his own special class - namely - American History X, which is hoped to bring down the hateful feelings, and inflict some sense into him. With a bunch of gangster chums around the place, exerting and trying to encourage racial hatred it isn't easy. And many fights are depicted. Struggles.But this film, which is phenomenally brutal, but effective has a big message to convey, and it does it well. Racism is just a case of hate, and being annoyed at things... And is totally wrong.I love this picture, it is well made, well acted and well received.It is also very deep. Making it absorbing and a grand viewing pleasure, even if it is brutal, and brash. This quote may help you understand how deep it is, a passage from Danny's essay:'So here's what I found out. My conclusion. I figured out that hate is baggage. Life's too short to be p***ed off all the time.'Highly recommended",9,1,2,17 September 2005
The Usual Suspects," Ingenious
","This film contains marvellous performances from the whole cast. It is directed with a sleek eye for detail and is surely one of the best films ever made. The story is clever, tricky, witty and completed with a twist that is just masterful.If you like a film that makes you think from start to finish about the plot, character motives, scenarios etc... then this is for you. If you like a twist you don't see coming this is for you. I won't spoil it. That would be criminal.I shall simply and briefly explain the plot. A man taken into custody (Spacey) explains the story of a gang of five criminals set up in a police line-up who decide to join together to commit the perfect heist. Who are then drawn deeper into a world of crime by a mysterious, unknown crimelord, which ended in an enormous explosion of death and carnage at the docks, in which a supposed drug deal went wrong... That's the gist. Sort of, but it's way more complex than that. See it.",10,0,1,30 August 2005
The Pianist," Not the best but still damn good...
","If I was an inch more sensitive I would've cried my eyes out. This film is heart-wrenching, a real weepy about the true story of some polish pianist whose name I cannot spell nor pronounce, who was left all alone in the Warsaw ghetto during WW2. Adrien Brody is sublime as the pianist. A man inspired by music to survive, a man who hid and tried to live even though his family had been taken cruelly by the Nazis. The film is slow and some scene of the Nazi brutality is shocking and sad. One man, a disabled inferiority who tries to protest about what the Germans are doing as they storm his house is shocking, and the pianist sees it all. The poor man is lifted in his wheelchair and is thrown over the balcony of the high rise house he lived in. that is one of the more brutal scenes, and the film is well made as all the brutality is shown from the pianist's point of view, and to know that this guy witnessed all this is very disturbing. Roman Polanski shows flair in his fantastic directing and the overall film is well worth watching. The only problem is that the ending is rather ridiculous, whether it happened or not. The part where he emerges from the derelict house which one friendly German has helped him hide in in a German coat and is then promptly shot at (not hit) by a Russian liberation troop is made farcical when they say 'Why are you wearing that coat?' and he replies 'I'm cold' - that is quite ridiculous and this rather silly emphasis on the liberation isn't powerful enough. I think they should have left this out and had the scene fade to the scene where the pianist's German helper is being held in a POW camp thing. Another reason is that The Pianist is nowhere near as good as Schindler's List, no questions... It is good and deserves some good recognition and viewings from everyone. It is good and deserves an 8",8,0,2,14 October 2005
Dog Day Afternoon," Hot
","This film is fantastic. Al Pacino is Sonny, a young punk who decides one hot afternoon to rob a bank with his friend Sal so that he can pay for his lover's sex change operation. What begins as a simple plan to walk in, get the cash and walk out in ten minutes turns into a desperate battle for survival as the cops turn up and the whole thing turns into a hostage situation. There's hardly any cash in the vault anyway as Sonny is given the wrong information, and if that's not disappointing enough, there's a load of irritating women employees and a manager who appear to add tension to the situation by occasionally revealing how much they hate these thieves and making a mockery of their plan. Yet as the film goes on the hostages do begin to sympathise with why they decided to rob their bank and the tension subsides somewhat although the mood is still kept to nerve snapping effect. As the cops move in using family members and other tactics to draw them out you feel that time is running out, and that the chance of the robbers getting away is about a million to one. In their final bid to escape, by holding the hostages at gunpoint and demanding a jet out of the country, it turns to tragedy. How you ask? well I suggest you buy it or tape it or both, heck it's such a good film it's worth it.The tension is excruciating and Pacino is on unbelievable form as the man facing the prison doors or his grave, the mood created by Sidney Lumet is spectacular and the only reason it gets a 9 is because it simply is not as good entertainment as say, Taxi Driver, The Silence of the Lambs or The Godfather. It is no doubt a very good film and I could watch it over and over again, but it does not get a 10. Yet I expect many would give it ten, and they may be right. I can only suggest that you watch this very unique film, that is based on the true event of a New York bank robbery on August 22nd 1972. And I can honestly say you will love it.",9,1,2,8 July 2005
Million Dollar Baby," One a Million - No make that a trillion.
","This is the best film this side of the year 2000. It is a moving tribute to Clint Eastwood's superior film making abilities and a film that has made an everlasting mark on the film industry. This film sports a beautiful cast of wonderful characters who are genuinely cared for by the audience, and the performances by Hilary Swank (who won the Best Actress Oscar for her role), Clint Eastwood (who shoulda won the Best Actor Oscar, but had to settle for the Best Direction and Picture Oscars instead), and Morgan Freeman (who procured the Best Supporting Actor Oscar) are fantastic, to say the least. So we know it is an Oscar winner, but so what? Well I'll tell you so what. This film is not only deserving of these awards but more praise and recognition than any other film made after the year 2000, and that goes for Gladiator, Training Day, Adaptation and even Clint's earlier film, Mystic River. Not only do the performances gleam, but the story is brilliant, moving and even based on true events. The moods created by Clint's unique direction and the superb acting talents of these main actors, is incomparable to any of the aforementioned films, and the style is not only beautiful but often mesmerising. You want to jump with glee as you see Clint and his boxing prodigy Hilary Swank aspire to great success, but you also feel the horrible snapping of your own nerves as you watch what becomes of them when Hilary's character Margaret Fitzgerald, is left paralysed after a fight. The film will definitely have some in tears, as I had to control the urge to let go and sob my eyes out myself, which I find is hard for a film to do. It is compelling to watch and the overall experience has helped me understand why my most respected director Martin Scorsese missed out on his Oscar. The truth is that Clint out-directed him and made a film that was a lot better to watch, and I think that if there is only one film worth watching this side of the millennium, it has to be Million Dollar Baby.",9,1,4,17 September 2005
A Clockwork Orange," This ain't 'Singin' in the Rain'
","A visceral assault on the senses.Stanley Kubrick is on top form with this film which sees Alex (The brilliantly cast Malcolm McDowell) a thugish teen, and his gang of droogs inflicting ultraviolence on their failing community.But that's not as simple as this film gets.The violence stops when Alex is apprehended for murder, after being double-crossed by his droogs who have gotten tired of him.He's chucked in the clink, and after a couple of years a revolutionary new technique is introduced that helps get rid of criminal attitudes. To us it would be called aversion therapy.After this, Alex is totally reformed of his criminality (or so it seems), yet he is also released to his former home, and on his return, he is cast out by his parents, and is beaten up by his former droogs, who ironically are now police officers.He makes his way to an isolated house. A house of which before he had visited with his droogs, and had left the old writer crippled, and his wife dead after viciously raping her.At first, he isn't recognised. But as he begins to re-sing 'Singing in the Rain.' Of which he heartedly sang the night of the previous attack, the man in the wheelchair remembers, and tries to bring around Alex's death.But, Alex after attempting to commit suicide, only ends up injured.In hospital, the papers advocate for poor Alex, who has been wronged, and the prime minister visits to lay his final plan to let Alex back into society as a respected individual.Yet, the last image will go to prove, that maybe, the person we are naturally always lurks beneath, as Alex's thought of sexual delight comes back - so surely will the rest of his evil desires...--- From that, you may think this film is deep, and quite repulsive to watch, but really it is quite amazing. Packed with themes, from the debate between free will and obedience, societal struggles and abuse of power it is a great picture. Well acted, well directed, and well written. A classic by all accounts.Previously it was even banned in the UK, and I urge you, be careful when you watch it. It is not for the faint hearted - especially religious people.9/10",9,2,6,12 July 2005
Groundhog Day," Deja Vu? Didn't you just say that?
","This romcom is a very original and imaginative piece of work. It is an excruciatingly tense viewing in which Bill Murray is stuck in the same day (Groundhog Day), and is reliving it over and over and over. The performances are good, and the fact Bill manipulates his producer to fall in love with him by acting in a way which would please her, after secretly finding out her preferences and charms from a previous Groundhog Day. Confused yet?If not you should be, the film is very confusing, and after a bit you think the day will never end, it is an astounding culmination of hilarious comedy, touching romance and outstanding acting that hits you with great effect.Its got action, romance, comedy and drama its funny, yet can still be saddening, so many emotions packed into one film make this a classic. Don't read this review, just get the film and watch it.",8,4,8,7 July 2005
Reservoir Dogs," A film of genuine quality...
","Reservoir dogs epitomises the stark violence that Tarantino was known for. His first outing as a director is the best other than the miraculous Pulp Fiction, but face it that is one of the best films EVER made. For the most part the film is set in an abandoned warehouse, where a motley crew of criminals dwell over the aftermath of a jewellery store heist gone wrong... With fantastic performances from the ensemble cast of Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Tim Roth, Tarantino himself, the late Lawrence Tierney and of course Michael Madsen in a career defining role form the colour coded gang who are furious at each other as they discover there is a rat in their midst who has set them all up. But who? Of course we know, and it is quite ironic to see Mr White defending him oblivious to who he is. This creates a great elevated level of tension as you watch him biting everyones head off who suggests that he Mr Orange is the rat. Brilliant. The story is told in typical jigsaw fashion, and it lets you know how the crew came together. The ending is a very tense affair as the cops close in and the so-called professionals turn on each other. The dialogue is fantastic, great examples include. ' Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie. Or are you gonna bite?' and ' was that as good for you as it was for me?' These are pretty memorable, especially the latter which is said after one of the most notorious movie scenes ever, which is when Mr Blonde cuts off his poor hostage, Marvin Dash's ear... gory. But still one of the best ever scenes in film history. Sure these are great and memorable, but the film undoubtedly owes a lot to older films, in particular I think it owes a lot to The Asphalt Jungle. But I think Tarantino has created a masterful piece of film, with slick direction, brilliant dialogue and an exceptionally told story, I think this film will definitely go down in history. As it says... every dog has its day, this will have many.",9,0,1,7 October 2005
Pulp Fiction," Excellent
","Has there ever been a more stylish film? Pulp Fiction, from the mighty intellect of Quentin Tarantino. A feast for the delights of a young man like myself. Constructed with prowess and supremacy.It tells a weaving tale in 3 main parts, with a little cunning introduction to boot. **First, it's a couple aptly named Pumpkin and Honeybun robbing a diner. (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) **Then it's two hit men (one being Samuel L Jackson stealing the show)on a job to retrieve some merchandise for their gang boss. **Then it's the other hit-man, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) being assigned to take the gang boss' wife out for a good time. Yet she ODs and it's up to him to get her to his drug dealers house for quick adrenaline. **Then it's Butch Coolidge's turn (played by Bruce Willis) as a boxer who betrays his boss (the gang boss) and does a runner, only to leave his gold watch which he must get back, exposing himself to the gang after him. **Then we revert back to the hit men after they have retrieved the boss' stuff, and who accidentally happen to shoot their passenger on the way home. And in comes the lovely stash him in the garage routine. Clean up and go, with the help of The Wolf (Harvey Kietel) and disgruntled Jimmy (Tarantino himself) who is the owner of said garage, in which he needs to clear before his wife gets home. **Finally the hit men go to breakfast after the clean up, and get caught up in the diner robbery, only to confront them in a dramatic climax of cool talk and muffins...That's a hell of a lot of film packed into 2hrs 20mins, and it is apt to assume that this is quite amazing. It sounds confusing and imaginative, and it sort of is. But Tarantino seems to add enough realism to the picture so you can watch it comfortably never once getting ahead of yourself, or lost in the plot. It's a cool look at gang life, with fun stories and a great soundtrack to back up that this film is not only hip to the beat, but a genuine cinematic triumph... Enjoy!",10,0,3,11 October 2005
Titanic," A huge disaster.
","There is more wrong with this film than anyone could possibly say. I honestly don't know where to begin. Romance is bad. Reasons.1)I am not the most knowledgeable person when it comes to romance, but isn't there more to it than nude portraits and life saving? Also where is the attraction to a guy that looks like a woman? Yes Leonardo DiCrapio acts a little effeminately to be loved as Jack Dawson our so-called hero, or at least I think that is what everyone thought he was, he isn't at all, and you know why? It is simply because that if Rose Dawson (played badly by Kate Winslet, I'll explain later) hadn't known him she would have gone home happily without losing anyone close to her, and she wouldn't have jumped, no way would she, and if she had at least the film would have been over quicker, and also he is totally repulsive, especially to the male half of the audience, I mean really who is this film for?2) Attraction. I don't know how each character was attracted to each other. How can Jack be attracted to Rose when she is spitting over the side of the ship? That's disgusting even for me, never mind an effeminate person like him. Also if it's true love why didn't Rose make more room on the floating door, which she could've done easily. He might have lived if she had, heck even Jim Carrey spotted that in the film Bruce Almighty. Acting? Reasons why it is also crap.1) Winslet acts like a snob for the first part and then like a tramp, would anybody demote themselves like this? When the kid drowned in the corridor, and when she fell off the side of the boat she hardly screamed. Why? Some say she was strong. peh... Almost everyone would have screamed in those situations. I have no idea what her face expression and posture was meant to say when Leo was arrested for possessing the planted diamond, I think she was upset, maybe angry, maybe about ready to laugh? I do not know, she had NO EXPRESSION.2) Leo was the same, NO EXPRESSION. Cameron directed people to act like gormless puppets, one face for every situation. Totally unrealistic. 3) Rose's family of snobs were stereotypical, I don't like the stereotype at all. Snobs are not just money-grabbers, I am not particularly rich, but I'd like to be. With the way that each stereotype acted, it seemed that the poor wanted to stay poor, and the rich wanted to be richer. I don't think people really act like this. The directing is bad. Reasons.1) James Cameron couldn't direct traffic. His style is crap, and revolves around two kind of people a) People who have one prime desire, and nothing else, and this doesn't remotely resemble reality at all - b) The other group are people who have one stereotyped personality. These are mainly Snobs, the poor and the ship staff. James Cameron should have worked to establish more realism within his characters, only Kathy Bates can be praised for achieving this.2) The special effects are too lavish. The boat is too glammed up, and anyone who says the boat looks 'real' is a total moron. A film needs to be more than special effects. He could have worked a little harder on the acting instead.3) Cameron's camera shots were mediocre to say the least. A few shots that were particularly bad include. The one where he shows us the whole ship from far out, I do not know what he was trying to achieve, my guess is that he was trying to show us how isolated the ship was, but this is pointless as we already knew it was isolated, you can't get more isolated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Another example of camera shots is to do with the exchange of angles. He too often flickers back from person to person, why can't he keep the camera in one place? He may as well have pointed it at the moon, that's more interesting than a random mess of pictures. Bad plot. Reasons.It is meant to be Rose's story, and I think it should have only included her accounts. But instead it had bits that made no sense. such as.1)The two old people cuddling, getting ready to die. 2)Plates falling from shelves. 3)The captain drowning on the bridge. 4)The dome shatters and everyone inside drowns These events are shown, yet in accordance to where Rose is during the film it doesn't make sense that she should have known about these things. Why add bits? My guess is to add to the sentimentality and drama but the overall realism and straightforwardness is lost thanks to this. Boy I hate this film. Oscars? It Shouldn't have won a single solitary thing, never mind 11. There are flaws. Bigguns. No denying it really, it is totally true that almost every aspect could have been cleaned up considerably.I don't care what anyone says. I find it unbearable to watch this garbage. There is a lot more than this, wrong with this diabolical film, but I have a 1000 word limit. So all I can really say to conclude is that this film for me if not for you - SANK.",1,5,11,1 September 2005
Mystic River," It has many depths...
","IMDb #160... They're having a laugh. Mystic River was robbed of many Oscars, especially Best Direction, as I believe Clint Eastwood has created a dark, harrowing tale of innocence lost, and the pain that will always come out of death and tragedy. Tim Robbins... The best character in the film, is sublime as Dave Boyle, a man who in his childhood was subjected to awful experiences at the hands of a malevolent abductor. Sean Penn... The winner of the coveted 2003 Best Actor Oscar, for which I think he deserved, only because Tim was categorised as mere support, but really I think this is a dubious categorisation. If Tim had been in the Best Actor nomination category, he'd have walked away with it. Nonetheless, Penn plays Jimmy Markum, one of Dave's childhood buddies, who watched as he was taken away. Sean Penn does have genuine acting flair in his part. Kevin Bacon plays Sean Devine the other childhood buddy who watched Dave get taken as well. The story however is not about childhood, as you probably gathered as each Tim, Sean and Kevin are all over thirty years old. In fact the film is set years after the tragedy, with the events looming upon each of them, like some dark figure. This event is echoed to each of them via names written in cement, and drains that sucked in hockey balls during their childhood games on the streets, and they often relive the sight of Dave in the back seat of his abductors car looking out at them as he is taken away. Of course there is an aura of mystery behind the now grown-up Dave Boyle. He has a rather gentle way about him, which is also enigmatic. He stutters, indicating he has some sort of long, deep-planted memory of what happened in the dark, dank cellar of his kidnapper long long ago. Okay... Cut to the chase... The film doesn't dwell on this, it just lingers. The three no longer have anything more than a quick nodded 'hello' to offer when they meet each other. Jimmy owns a convenience store, and is plagued with a previous jail sentence and criminal life he'd like to forget. Sean is a homicide detective. and Dave... Well he's got his life sorted, he's got a nice wife and a son whom he loves dearly... Sounds like everything is fine. Wrong. The film is actually a 'whodunit' and the victim is Jimmy's nineteen year old daughter, Katie. This one event brings the three together. Jimmy is obviously the caring father who has sworn to God, to kill the person who killed his daughter. Sean is the homicide detective trying to figure out who's done it, and Dave... well he's a suspect. The film is dark, sleepy, very in-depth and very dramatic piece. You won't find many better Clint Eastwood films out there... It is fantastic, and I seriously urge you to see it.",9,1,2,25 October 2005
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," You'd be mad not to see it...
","Fantastic. Phenomenal. Cool. Stunning... Just a few of many positive words to describe the amazing 1975 Milos Forman classic, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. a moving and sometimes comic portrayal about the goings on inside an Oregon Mental Institute, with Jack Nicholson leading the star-studded cast to greatness as Randall P McMurphy, the one who flew over the cuckoo nest, and set the whole strict system on fire. Louise Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched. A cold, stark authoritarian keen to preserve the routines and discipline amongst the patients. But... Then Randall turns up, in his rambunctious but apparently sane manner, and the sparks fly. Nurse Ratched tries her best to subdue him into the peaceful, sedated and rather boring existence of the institute, but evidently appears to fail as Randall has plans of his own. Randall is not going to be pushed around by this woman. And he makes a stand, urging the others to take the stand as well, and break the routine, that probably sent them mad in the first place. Nicholson is fantastic and he thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar, and Fletcher deserved her actress' equivalent Oscar too. They react and ignite each others actions so well that they couldn't claim anything less for their very realistic acting talents. Young Danny DeVito, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd and even Scatman Crothers turn in good performance that are perceived as quite comical, but I'm not sure if they are meant to be really (I guess it is easy to laugh at the insane because of the general odd things they do, such as when DeVito eats the dice out of the Monopoly game.) Forman directs well, and the mood is exceptional. An aura of enigma surrounds the whole film, because watching it, no matter how many times often proves to be a quite joyful, yet confusing affair. I swear I cannot figure out these characters, they are too profoundly presented. The overall recommendation is high, the film is one of my all time favourites, adapted from the classic Ken Kesey novel, and it is without a doubt a complete and utter joy to see.",10,2,4,21 October 2005
The Green Mile," FB loves SK
","I think Frank Darabont loves Stephen King. That's not a bad thing though. He's made Shawshank and this cracking film, and well they are amazing.He creates a harrowing, dark yet at the same time a rather sweet little film and I think it's all nice.The story, well a guy with basically the hands of god is accused of murdering two young girls and set on death row. Throughout his time in the clink he forms close bonds with a number of the prison workers and demonstrates his amazing power to them. With a few other screwballs on the green mile, notably Billy the Kid who is the worst of the bunch.Tom Hanks plays the main warden who takes the guy, John Coffey (A brilliant Michael Clarke Duncan) by his word and attempts to find out more about the giant man's healing ability.By the end you get to know that it wasn't Johnkilling the girls, but more over he was trying to cure them. But they had gone. The heart-shattering performance is what gives the film the edge, and it's final execution scene by the wardens, even though they know in their hearts that John is innocent, yet they cannot prove it makes them weep. And it is this, the dramatic climax that gets you to appreciate the force of this thoroughly imaginative film. I salute it, it is amazing.Although, not as good as the book, still damn worthy of praise...",8,0,1,12 October 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," Get busy living. Or get busy dying.
","Outstanding. Never has a film gripped so powerfully before. Some films are great and hold you well enough, but this absolute powerhouse of a film keeps me glued, and is a great tribute to Hollywood, the great Stephen King short story, and of course a great tribute to all the things that make hope and freedom so wonderful. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his life, as Andy Dufresne. A strong-headed man who is sent to Shawshank prison, wrongfully accused of 'murdering his wife, and the fellow she was banging.' With that in mind, it is excruciatingly tense and powerful, as we watch Andy adapt to prison life, form a beautiful friendship with 'Red' the convict who knows how to get things, (played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman, who in my opinion deserved to win the Best Actor Oscar) and of course see him handle himself around those out to get him, which spans from other prisoners to the warden, who he helps turn the prison into a business, due to his good experience as a banker, the occupation which he held before being convicted. But as the picture goes on, you can see the yearning to get out. He is a bird that has been caged wrongfully, and when you see how long he has been locked away for, even though he didn't do it it really makes for stunning and compelling viewing. The ending is beautifully scripted, and the mood is outstanding. Frank Darabont has created an exceptional film, with realistic talents and people we can care for. The stereotype of the prisoner is made into something better, and the overall experience of this film is magnificent, with fantastic memorable quotes, and an exchange of good to bad atmosphere, which at one point makes you feel good watching it, but then shows the awful atrocities and seriousness of the situation. This complex style of direction and storytelling is amazing, and the ending is top notch, I won't spoil this bit though. You wanna know how good it is? Then watch it and be dazzled by this truly remarkable film. 10/10",10,0,1,14 September 2005
Platoon," The first casualty of war is innocence....
","Relentless. Shocking and totally totally amazing. Platoon is Oliver Stone's chilling vision of the Vietnam War, something he knew all about as he was part of it all. The ants that might just riddle you to death. The ambushes. The night watches that went wrong and this film doesn't paint a pretty picture. The platoon is a small hostile family of testosterone junkies who want nothing more than to kill the 'gook b****rds.' They don't give in to bargaining, they don't take any s**t and they are hard as nails. So when Charlie Sheen is thrown into the flames he is in for a shock as he seems to be the only one with a bone in him called remorse and shame. So when he comes to blows with Tom Berenger, the hard as nails (think I said that once) commander who likes to kill everything he sees, the fireworks certainly fly, ending in a huge battle of courage and survival. That doesn't really tell you much, it is just a bunch of words, well I can only say tat if you are a die hard war movie fan watch it. It is truly worth it.",8,2,5,14 October 2005
Raging Bull," That's Entertainment.
","Unbelievably emotional, brutally blunt, and acting to end all acting. This is the best boxing/sports film/biopic EVER. It is absolutely off-the-chart good. Often under-rated, and so called difficult to love. I honestly cannot see why. DeNiro goes to extreme length to add to the repulsion scale, and Scorsese makes an impact with beautiful classical scores, and black and white shots which somehow seem to be better than what it would have been like in colour. This is better than Rocky and damn provocative. Even the real Jake LaMotta said DeNiro did a better job at portraying himself than he could do. And I can believe it.For all those who have not seen, see it. And for all those who thought it was horrific to watch, and was therefore a bad film. Watch it again properly. It is brilliant.

The Silence of the Lambs," 'Never Forget What He Is...'
","Reasons this is so good:It has some of the best characters ever created embedded in a storyline that is so famously crisp, and clever that to watch it even after 100 previous viewings is still an absolute delight. It is a film of sheer talent, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins play each others nemesis yet hide this in a tight net of trust and curiosity over each others character. and I think the unbelievable potency of Hannibal 'the cannibal' Lecter is so strong that to actually merge him into reality is totally feasible. Jonathan Demme also pulls off such fantastic direction, that is shockingly vivid and imaginative, and the atmosphere created with eerie scores in the background and repulsive locations (such as Buffalo Bill's house) is brilliance to a high degree. If you only ever watch one film a year I suggest you watch this.",10,6,14,29 June 2005
Blade Runner," Marvelous
","It's a very good, and very well made sci-fi classic.It has it's own style and feel to it, and unlike most sci-fi films it doesn't stretch the boundaries of human knowledge and lend siege to a bunch of aliens or space fights or whatever. It lays down themes that although seem a million light years away, are in fact maybe closer to our time than we first thought.It's a story of the blade runner, played by Harrison Ford hunting down 4 humanoid rebels trying to find their creator, with a bit of killing along the way.With a riveting story, depth to characters and amazing memorable acting from Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Joe Turkel and most of all the superb Rutger Hauer.I think it is only suffice to say that this film is a marvel of it's genre and with criticism and technicalities aside I think you cannot argue that this film is great in all proportions.",9,0,1,4 November 2006
The Deer Hunter," One Shot... watch it.
","This should be a lot higher up the list. It is definitely for me if no one else, the best war film ever created. It revolves around three steel workers of a sleepy Pennsylvanian town, who after basking in the delights of family and friends, and taking the time to go deer hunting in which they find happiness and freedom, they come face to face with the horrors of war. The hour long introduction to the three main characters played sublimely by Robert DeNiro (Michael), Christopher Walken (Nick, Who won Best Supporting Actor at the 1978 Oscars, and deservedly so), and John Savage (Stephen) offers a long and beautifully slow view of these people who by the end of the first hour you really feel close to. And then everything takes an abrupt twist. These men are thrown into the Vietnam war, out of the niceness comes the horror, and I think the contrast is amazing. (The long introduction that shows the cosiness and happiness these men once knew shocks you to the core and I think Michael Cimino shows this part off brilliantly. I have heard many say the first part drags on too long, yet I think this adds to the impact when the war is suddenly turned on). They end up in a POW camp being forced to play Russian roulette or else they die. This is probably one of the most graphic parts of the film, and it clearly shows that friendship and unity prevails as they do end up escaping desperately, trying to keep their lives in the place in which to keep it is a very hard thing to do. The war aspect is exceptionally well filmed by Michael Cimino and illustrates the darkness that you would expect from war. You won't find many better pictures of war better than this.As the men separate after escaping, they end up in different places, Nick stays in Vietnam and plunges himself into the dark underworld that breathes beneath the surface of the war, although he pleaded for Michael to make sure he got home during the first part of the film (So clearly the first half of the film lingers on, and you really can feel the heartbreak as they are split up). Michael goes home, and Stephen winds up in a disabled hospital for veterans of the war. As Michael tries to get back to the sleepy attitude of the town he ends up being awash with guilt and returns to Vietnam, on a mission to reunite himself with his friends, and the end scene between him and Nick is heart-wrenching, and one of the best finale's to a film you will ever witness, it is unbeatable. I love it, you will too, it is a long one, over 3 hours long, but the length does not harm the viewing pleasure. It is an epic, watch it please you've only got one shot.",10,1,2,8 July 2005
Heat," Very hot
","A classic hip thriller surrounding a world where crime lords run the show and cops can only try and keep up with the pace. 'walk out in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner' That's how the game is played. Criminals have to stay ahead of the heat and plan in advance to get away with whatever they can. First they strike an armoured van, then a bank heist. They do whatever they can, they are hi-tech and infinitely smart. Robert DeNiro is Niel McCauley the leader of a motley crew of criminals who think they're better than the law, and smarter than the cops. As the film goes on they get into bigger things, the heat gets turned up and they even begin to stalk the cops, not have the cops stalking them. But every game must have an ending, and even though DeNiro is on the verge of getting out, he can't help himself and so he begrudgingly gets back in on the business with the intention of killing a piece of scum killer who used to be a part of his gang. Al Pacino is Vincent Hanna a top notch cop who wants nothing more than to bang up his nemesis, but cannot find enough evidence to support his case. But as DeNiro gets back in he takes an even bigger risk, that exposes him to the full force of the heat, and Pacino is ready for a final showdown. A showdown of courage, guns, and willpower. Honestly this film is brilliant, tense and taut and not form the faint hearted. It is nonetheless fantastic and even Val Kilmer's thrown in to add to the bang. Michael Mann shows flair in probably his best ever film. It is a long three hour epic, but it is also a great film to watch over and over again.",9,3,6,29 October 2005
The Great Escape," King of cool...
","This wonderful star-studded war film is one of the best of the genre. With Steve McQueen (on brilliant form), James Garner, Richard Attenborough, James Coburn, Donald Pleasence and the late Charles Bronson this film is an absolute gem from the 60s. Based on the true story of a bunch of soldiers who are prisoners of war in the notorious POW camp Stalag Luft III, but the Gerries have underestimated their prisoners who like to give the Germans the run about by planning and staging miraculous escapes, but none are the same as the one they embark on in this camp, in which they attempt to get 250 prisoners out, it is unbelievably tense and the dialogue, amazing score, great directing and use of scenery, and of course the marvellous acting all add to create a mix that ends up in one hell of a film. Watch out for the cooler scene, which is so famous nowadays that it is copied by everyone under the sun, from The Simpsons to Chicken Run. But unlike these shows this film tells the ultimate story and is one that will make anyone all smiley in the finish.",9,1,2,13 October 2005
The Breakfast Club," Are we really like this
","The Breakfast Club poses this question. Do we, or have we been stereotypical and conformed to a school society. Have there been the Jocks, Beauty Queens, Loafers, Brainiacs, Bullies, Loners, Psychopaths, Sociopaths, The Popular, The Pretenders, The Brave, The Noble...etc etc... To be honest, I never noticed... not until I watched The Breakfast Club. And if this is the case. I wonder two things. 1: How do we shake the stereotypes 2: Can we change on just one random meeting with a bunch of strangersMaybe, maybe not... but all that can be said is that this film really impressed me, and made me think about things I never considered before.John Hughes directs, this funny little film, full of attitude, and a brat pack of student players, who are both realistic and enjoyable to watch. I recommend this film heartily, and think that most would enjoy this film.",8,0,1,14 March 2006
Gladiator," Out of this world.
","Let this amazing quote tell you how good it is.Commodus: What is your name? Gladiator: My name is GladiatorGladiator turns his back to CommodusCommodus: How dare you turn your back to me. Slave. You will remove your helmet and tell me your name.Gladiator turns and removes his helmetGladiator: My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius. Leader of the Felix legion and commander to the armies of the north. Loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son. Husband to a murdered wife, and I shall have my vengeance in this l life or the next.The quote goes something like that, but when Russell Crowe let's rip with it, it doesn't half sound impressive.Along with tigers, big fat Gaullish warriors and a wonderfully created Rome, this film goes down in history like nothing else.",9,4,7,23 October 2005
