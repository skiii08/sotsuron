Catch Me If You Can," Kingpin
","This was a great movie. I usually can not bear to sit through a Leonardo Dicaprio movie, but this one was good. Don't blame me... maybe it was the whole '[...]king of the world' thing. What's Eating Gilbert Grape? and Catch Me are great Leo movies. The two BEST he has EVER done. He acts well and the lines don't sound forced like in Titanic. Definitely see this one. This guy, who the movie was about, was a genius. Either that or very crafty. Rent this today!",10,1,2,16 May 2003
The Ring," Awesome
","Awesome... that's all I have to say about it. The movie left me in an emotional reck, but it was in a good way. GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Naomi Watts, you rock! It was unpredictable and filmed brilliantly. The picture was incredible and they did not over do it with the scary stuff. It was the fear of the unknown that was just incredible. Wonderful! Brilliant! The scariest movie I have ever seen. Awesome...",10,0,0,3 November 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Bloody good
","Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley did a wonderful job. It was really rad seeing Johnny Depp do such a good impersonation of Keith Richards, but then again Johnny Depp is one of THE best actors in Hollywood. He picks great roles and here is another example. Pirates is a wonderful movie. GO SEE IT! Oh and it was really great how they mimicked a lot of scenes from the original ride, i.e., the scene in the Port Royal jail with the criminals trying to get the dog to bring the keys (that are in his mouth)over. Bloody good... Go see it!",10,0,1,25 July 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," Fantastic!!!
","This was the best comedy ever. I have never laughed that hard and for that long. Duration - over an hour. Renee was brillant, Colin was magnificent/gorgeous/fabulous(Pride and Prejudice-superb), and Hugh was funny as hell! Great job directing, great writing, great acting...... loved it!",10,2,3,23 October 2001
The Pianist," Wonderful
","This movie was wonderful. When a film makes me feel the way I felt when I watched The Pianist then I know it is outstanding. I felt what Szpilman and his family felt in the pit of my soul. It truly moved me. I thank you , Mr. Polanski. You are truly an artist. I hope Mr. Polanski and Adrien Brody both win Academy Awards. Truly touching. I wish I could have done something to those Nazis and thankfully they got theirs. I am glad both my grandfathers helped.",10,0,1,17 February 2003
Black Hawk Down," The most wonderful movie of all time.
","This was one the most wonderful movies I have ever seen. Ridley, you succeeded again! I hate to say that about a movie about a real life event that we as civilians can not even begin to fathom. I salute all of those soldiers who died in that firefight. They are all true heros. The book was really good and detailed, but this movie was an awakening. It was incredible and fantastic. Intense. Emotional. Patriotic. The acting was unbelievable. This movie deserves the highest honor it can receive. It deserves the Oscar. I hope it wins in every category it is nominated for.",10,1,2,19 January 2002
The Last Samurai," outstanding
",Go see this movie. Tom Cruise is incredible and so is Ken Watanabe. I hope that Tom Cruise gets AT LEAST a best actor Oscar nod and for sure an Oscar because he deserves it. Ken Watanabe should get an Oscar for best supporting actor. He was outstanding. I love him! I don't think that the movie would have been as good if those two actors did not work together. The whole cast was incredible. They worked off each other and really made this movie a beautiful work of art. I think it is great how they reflect the Native American struggle with the white man to the traditional Japanese way of life and the modern Japanese way of life struggle. It is just incredible. Go see this movie.,10,1,2,8 December 2003
