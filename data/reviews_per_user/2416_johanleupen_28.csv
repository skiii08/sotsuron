Scarface," Extremely violent, intense epic about the cuban crime-wave
","My favorite DePalma film of course, it tells the story of cuban refugee Tony Montana (Pacino) who is seduced by the quick money and the lifestyle befitting druglords. This movie is hard as nails, and it was considered too violent in it's day. That's also why it is so powerful and realistic of course. Screenplay by Oliver Stone. My only complaint is Gorgio Moroder's screeching synthesizer-music which is just terrible. Oh well.",10,0,0,20 July 2000
Alien 3," A terrible misfire.
","Agreed, it was just about the hardest thing in the world to follow-up after Alien and Aliens but did it have to be this bad? Instead of expanding on the premise, all Fincher does is go back to just one Alien-threat. And all that ever happens is some running around in corridors and some shrieking music, which makes for a poor attempt to achieve the same atmosphere as in Alien. Fincher also tries to rob us of any future alien-installments in the climax but luckily they went ahead and did it anyway with Alien: Resurrection.",4,394,413,4 August 2000
The Big Lebowski," one of the funniest movies i've ever seen
","there's not much to tell about the plot. that's not what this film is about. it's about the life of the dude, excellently played by jeff bridges. his laid-back nihilistic view of the world is absolutely hilarious. some may regard this as commentary on today's generation x. maybe it is. but above all it is a brilliant comedy. great role for steve buscemi by the way.",9,0,0,5 August 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Effective. Not nearly as terrible as Alien3.
","When David Fincher came along with Alien3 he nearly killed off the entire legacy when he failed to live up to the expectations and plunged Ripley into her death. Fortunately the wonders of Hollywood found a way around this to make yet another installment simply by cloning Ripley, hence Resurrection. It's all a bit too easy for me, but Resurrection does improve upon the last movie. The sets are fantastic, Weaver is still good, and the action is high-paced and exhillarating. Winona Ryder however doesn't belong in an Alien-film or any sci-fi movie for that matter. The story starts off in the right direction but it takes are wrong turn in the end (the newborn-sequence is terribly awkward). As you can see it kind of a mixed bag, although it's ultimately satisfying and it does make you forget about Fincher's screw up with Alien3.",7,2,4,4 August 2000
The Mummy," A Great popcorn movie. Don't overthink it, just sit back and enjoy.
","It was a great popcorn-movie. Just a lot of fun to watch. And don't start complaining about the cardboard characters or the story. This is not a pretentious movie. It doesn't set some kind of serious tone. It was all too clear that Sommers and co were just having fun with this movie. The continuous string of intentionally cheesy one-liners and gags establishes that no one should take this seriously. Just sit back and relax. Enjoy the set-design, the special-effects and the comic-book acting and you'll be alright.",7,0,0,11 October 2000
Chicken Run," Sporadicly funny but mostly kids-stuff.
","It's too bad this movie can't be really enjoyable for both children and adults. Disney pulls it off all the time. Sure, it started off with the Great Escape-spoofs and that was pretty funny, but after that the story fell flat. And it takes more than a couple of funny looking clay chickens to keep people interested for an hour and a half. The climax was ok though.",6,0,0,20 July 2000
X-Men," Very satisfying.
","I'm glad Singer didn't go for the obvious summer-blockbuster extravaganza-type movie. The action-sequences are omnipresent of course, and there are plenty of spectacular scenes but there's a kind of subtle atmosphere that is kept going which i found to be very cool. There's some nice attention for detail with a couple of well placed jokes. It's not just loud explosions and people punching eachother (MI:2). Very good casting! I particularly liked the way Stewart and McKellen interact. They both have this quiet authority.This is the kind of summer-movie we should see more often. Keep it up. I can't wait for the sequels!",8,0,0,4 August 2000
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A testament to Kubrick's versatility and genius.
","It is really astonishing to see how versatile Kubrick really was. Personally i was surprised to see that he could even succeed in comedy, but he does so, excellently i might add. At least as impressive is Peter Sellers in three different roles, each of them brilliantly distinctive and amusing. Pay special attention to Sellers' scene in the phone booth. Also noteworthy are his telephone-conversations with prime-minister Kissoff. In addition i would like to add that the cynical opening and closing credits-scenes are sensational. Watch for the rythmic editing accompanying 'Until we meet again.'",9,1,1,4 July 2001
Cast Away," Hanks is great throughout, the last fifteen minutes are a letdown however.
","A very impressive performance by Hanks. It really is quite an achievement to carry an entire movie singlehandedly. Absolutely no interplay, mere glances and expressions. Also it was fascinating to see how engaging the island-scenes were even though they were terribly low-concept (Hanks trying to crack open a couple of coconuts, Hanks opening a bunch of boxes that washed ashore, Hanks catching some fish). The direction was very good indeed. I was let down however, by the last 15 minutes. The story was completely aimless and empty, and i also found it very frustrating to see how the idea of 'hope for the future' was being enforced upon us. The crash-sequence deserves special mention, as it had me on the edge of my chair (what a terrible cliche). The level of realism was astounding.",7,0,0,4 March 2001
Cast Away," An excellent piece of work
","It was really intriguing to see how this film can succeed using such a basic principle. A large part of the film is carried solehandedly by Hanks, whereas there is no dialogue to speak of, no dramatic tension in the traditional sense, no score to accompany the imagery. Yet Cast Away keeps us completely involved. I'm not exactly his greatest fan, but i think Hanks is to be commended. He really deserved the critical acclaim for this role. I think it is terrific to see such great names (Hanks & Zemeckis) taking these great risks in filmmaking. (Unfortunately) I rarely see this kind of experimental filmmaking in mainstream hollywood. The film's ending leaving us a bit puzzled, perhaps the story could have been resolved in a better way and i never cared much for Helen Hunt, however all in all this is still a great piece of work. The plane-crash sequence deserves special mention, as it is truly spectacular as well as frighteningly real.",7,0,0,18 January 2001
American Psycho," Very disturbing. Christian Bale is very good.
","Even though the violence and sex-scenes were trimmed down a bit just prior to release, it's still very disturbing and makes for two uncomfortable hours of watching. Excellent sets, production design and actors all fit perfectly into the story. And Christian Bale's cold and unemotional performance is just right. Some horrific scenes and some very humorous ones in between. Not exactly subtle in any way but that was never intended i guess.",8,0,0,15 October 2000
U-571," Nothing terrible but it won't raise your eyebrows either.
","You don't see too many submarine-movies anymore these days. I think that's a shame. I also think it's a shame u-571 isn't anything remarkable. It's watching sweaty faces looking up as they hear their own sub collapsing under the pressure for two hours. It's not really about the crew or the enemy, it's just about the submarine. And then there are some nice action sequences and some passable 'thrills' and a forgettable climax with a bunch of bangs and that's it.",6,0,1,12 August 2000
Being John Malkovich," Very refreshing. A joy to watch.
","This is a really refreshing film to see. Finally, a totally original film, combined with a plot that's well worked out. All of the rules in film-making are thrown overboard, and yet we're left not with a bunch of unstable rubbish but with a very satisfying final result. Acting is great. Notably Malkovich himself, and the unrecognisable Diaz is good as well. Some scenes are completely hilarious. I get the feeling that it's a string of comments on society rather than a coherent plot but somehow it all feels related. When i watched Jonze in an interview talking about it i couldn't gain any insight into this guy. He's totally nuts if you ask me, but he's still a brilliant filmmaker.",9,0,0,15 October 2000
Ocean's Eleven," There's nothing remarkable here, but Ocean's Eleven is very entertaining nonetheless.
","In this eagerly awaited, star-studded remake of the 60s rat-pack crime-caper of the same name, Soderbergh manages to combine his dry sense of wit, beautifully stilized camerawork and a few enjoyable performances in a very pleasant way. Admittedly, Soderbergh ignores the fact that his plot doesn't really hold together at times, also the insertion of various catchy one-liners feels fabricated and forced on a few occasions, but all things considered there's a lot of fun to be had here if you don't take it all too seriously as some critics have. Granted, Ocean's Eleven doesn't tacklesocial problematics (nor did Soderbergh aim to in the first place of course)  and it certainly isn't a masterpiece but it creates a very uncomplicated, laid-back vibe that is really enjoyable most of the time. This must be largely accredited to the dialogue which is very witty most of the time. The actors all seem very at ease and it is easy to sympathise with these charming crooks, a special notice goes to Versace-clad ex-casino bigshot Elliot Gould. Which leaves for a few minor mishaps which I will address briefly. First of all the character of Julia Roberts isn't very essential to the plot, nor is her appearance special in any way. Therefore it's a shame her storyline with George Clooney takes up so much time in the later part of the story, which concludes in an unnecessarily predictable and well rounded ending. I believe a cameo-appearance would have been more than enough and I'm afraid the scribes were forced to squeeze Roberts into the story. Secondly there is very little character-development or motivation for that matter. Also, no effort is taken to bring any nuance to the 'villain'-character of Andy Garcia, whereas it would have been more interesting to see any redeeming traits in his personality. Garcia delivers a very unremarkable performance that won't raise any eyebrows. Just don't expect Ocean's Eleven to change cinematic landscape for the years to come and you will be fine after two hours well spent.",7,0,1,11 January 2002
Coyote Ugly," Your grandmother would fall asleep watching this.
","This movie is nothing like the trailers would have you believe. A very predictable little tale about a girl who comes to the big city to chase her dreams. There is truly nothing remarkable about this picture. No rough edges, no risky stuff, no violence (unless you want to qualify the 'bar-fights' as violence, a few guys pushing each other...please).   The conversations between Piper Perapo and Adam Garcia drove me nuts after a while. Stop the charming crap already! This is not how people talk! And Perapo's only talent seems to lie in the fact that she knows how to look really really sad. Boohoo! Don't expect to see any kind of excess here (remember Bruckheimer is behind this), this is a gushy romantic tale without any merit whatsoever. Your grandmother would fall asleep watching this.",5,1,1,10 June 2001
Patton," A brilliant role for George C Scott.
","Powerful acting performances, George C Scott is absolutely insurpassable as the iron fisted general. The scenes of him visiting the sites of ancient Roman battles are brilliant. It is fascinating and in a way tragic to see how Patton's harsch and old-fashioned manners, along with his romantic perception of war, don't seem to fit in with contemporary efficient warfare anymore. Note his opening speech directed towards his troops. It is classic material and it hasn't lost any of it's impact. Highly recommended.",8,1,3,4 July 2001
Mission: Impossible II," This sequel doesn't live up to it's predecessor.
","Where Mission: Impossible was more a thriller with a complex storyline and interesting twists and characters, M:I 2 is more a brainless action-picture. A good one at that but still a disappointment. I'm also not a very big fan of John Woo. Technically he's brilliant ofcourse but he doesn't know how to develop a story. Dialogue in his films is always sentimental and corny. The action-sequences are very fast-paced but too outrageous. All these slow-motion shots make the whole thing look like a circus-show. And where do all these doves keep coming from? Doves don't belong in bunkers! Woo is taking this whole dove-thing to far. Can't he be subtle for once? And then there's the climax which is even more ridiculous. It's too bad Cruise and DePalma couldn't get along on-set or this might have been a whole different picture.",6,0,0,4 August 2000
Black Hawk Down," Remarkably accurate and remarkably hollow.
","Black Hawk Down avoids dealing with the political side of the story and basically restricts itself to combat situations between American soldiers and Somalian rebels. It must be said that most of these scenes are brilliantly executed, wonderfully shot with pale filters and edited with a very hectic and effective pace. But BHD suffers from an overkill of technically superior firefights, that eventually deadens the senses just as the action sequences in Pearl Harbor tended to make viewers numb after prolonged bombardments and such. Scott undoubtedly succeeds in depicting a realistic and impressive report of what happened in Mogadishu, but he also ignores content in favour of style and thereby fails to make any statement about the events whatsoever (apart from stating that these soldiers were tremendously brave maybe which is of course a statement that will not raise any eyebrows); our heroes remain anonymous to us, also there isn't any character development to speak of. At one point i expected the film to focus on the executive mismanagement that may have played an important role in this military tragedy, but unfortunately Scott never really adresses this aspect of the events (and i have a feeling the military gratiously providing the actual Blackhawk craft for the shooting had something to do with this). Also I found it surprising to see BHD was practically devoid of patriotic sentiment (in the sense of American flags in the wind, accompanied by trumpets and horns) unlike almost all of Bruckheimer's other productions. What we're left with in the end is a remarkably accurate but also remarkably hollow war-film, not a waste of time, but certainly not worth the hype it has caused.",6,0,0,1 March 2002
The Graduate," Outstanding. Hoffman's breakthrough.
","A breakthrough in its time. About a young man's insecurities, the rift between parents and children, these subject weren't discussed in movies at the time. It hasn't lost it's brilliance. Cinematography is excellent. It still is Hoffman's best performance.",10,1,2,21 July 2000
The Mummy Returns," Unpretentious fun.
",The term roller-coaster ride is most befitting this movie. The storyline is intentionally thin and tongue-in-cheek. The cast seems to be having a lot of fun (just like last time). A lot of time was spend on great special effects and set-design. A string of great action sequences is tied together with lost of gags and pace. The pigmee-creatures were especially funny by the way. No complaints here. Just grab your bucket of popcorn and sit back.,7,0,0,10 June 2001
Total Recall," Absolutely great. Paul Verhoeven is my hero!!!
",I love everything about this movie: the over-the-top violence. Jerry Goldsmith's music. The complexity of the script. Verhoeven's tongue-in-cheek style. His critical view of the American lifestyle is so obviously the reason he receives so much criticism about this film and others. The special effects are also brilliant by the way.,10,0,2,18 July 2000
The Untouchables," Very skillfully done. Supporting roles outshine Kostner.
","The main character may be a bit boring, but there are some terrific performances by Connery, DeNiro and i even like Garcia, (normally i can't stand the guy). Also great action sequences masterfully directed by DePalma, and some great setpieces. Watch for the dinner-table sequence with DeNiro holding his baseballbat: an instant classic.",8,1,2,21 July 2000
Amélie," An interesting effort that is enjoyable but highly overrated nonetheless.
","Amelie tells the story of a young girl's quest to make the world a better place by bringing people together. Rather than presenting us with grand narratives and extensive plot-devices, Jeunet starts off by focusing on the little things. It's refreshing to see a movie dedicated to detail and everyday life. For instance, every character is outlined by a micro-history catalogueing his or her likes and dislikes, which leads to some amusing scenes. Furthermore, Amelie's vivid imagination is captured by a terrific art-department and very dynamic camera-movements. However, as soon as Jeunet feels compelled to shift focus from setting up his environment to constructing a plot, he loses that which sets Amelie apart from other films. To be perfectly honest it's relatively tiresome to watch Amelie looking for and finding the love of her life. The strongest element in the movie is it's ability to steer away from (predictable) plot lines but unfortunately Jeunet eventually feels the necessity to conform to classic narrative. We are left with a movie that is enjoyable but highly overrated to be sure.",7,1,3,2 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," George Lucas' classic sci-fi fairy tale.
","Of course everybody has seen it so it's kind of unnecessairy for me to summarize. I'd like to speak my mind on this movie. I've always found it to be very entertaining and very well constructed (certainly it deserves praise for the groundbreaking visual effects). I find it fascinating and rather surprising however, that so many people name it as their all-time favourite. I've always preferred Star Trek, i think it's better thought out (it was also earlier established i might add). Special effects are better with Star Wars of course, but that shouldn't be the driving force of a movie. Nonetheless i like Star Wars and i hope Lucas learns from his mistakes with episode 1. Maybe he should watch this one a couple of times more.",7,1,2,21 July 2000
Goodfellas," Best movie I have ever seen. Unmissable.
","This movie is what got me hooked on movies to begin with. To me it's the greatest film ever made. So many excellent scenes. So many excellent cameramovements. The voice-overs. The acting (i'd name a couple of good performances but they're all just terrific). The score is also terrific. It's the story of Henry Miller's rise and fall in the mob-world. The story effortlessly unfolds into a shocking, sometimes even hilariously funny but always compelling epic. It's a portrait of the crime-world in suburbia during the 50s 60s and 70s and it is so plausible it came as no surprise to me to learn it was based on a true story.",10,0,1,20 July 2000
High Fidelity," Very nice work. Very gloomy, but a bit long.
","Nice work. Interesting to see how endearing John's character becomes to us, even though he's not exactly the most charming person in the world. The narration-style has been done before a couple of times (remember Goodfellas?) but it's still a nice touch. Good acting all round. Well not all round as i found Catherine Zeta Jones a little out of place, i didn't care much for her 'acting', she very pleasing to the eye but that's about it in my opinion. Some very funny scenes with the two store clerks, excellent casting.",7,0,1,15 October 2000
High Fidelity," Very enjoyable to watch. Not earthshocking though.
","What set High Fidelity apart for me, was the fact that John Cusack's character evoked my sympathy even though he had few redeeming characteristics. I also particularly liked the narration style which consisted largely of John Cusack talking to the camera, it reminded me of Scorsese's Goodfellas. And i was happy to see that there was no overly sentimental, sugarcoated ending, which would have ruined the film's moody atmosphere.",7,0,1,12 September 2000
The Godfather," Extremely good. A must-see in film-history.
",Coppola's classic interpretation of storytelling fits perfectly into this tale which many consider to be the greatest film ever made. The tragic life of michael corleone and his family against the background of the 40s new york underworld; a must-see in film-history. The scenes are extremely convincing and the atmosphere is appropriately dark and gloomy. The music accurately captures the epic scale and drama that the film is trying to get across.,10,0,1,20 July 2000
