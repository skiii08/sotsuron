Catch Me If You Can," Greatest movie EVER!
","This movie has a great deal of character that everyone would love. Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio are great together. It makes you feel like you are the characters and not the viewer. So whatever age you are, 20, 35, 40, 18, or even 75 you will absouloutley love this blockbuster hit.",9,0,1,27 April 2003
