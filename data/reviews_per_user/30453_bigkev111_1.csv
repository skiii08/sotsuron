Sucker Punch," This is by far one of the best movies ever made!!!
","First of all I would just like to say I understand everyone has their own opinion on movies but I honestly don't know how anyone could not love this movie. This movie is absolutely amazing, It has everything you could want in it like gorgeous girls, amazing CGI, superb story, mind blowing action scenes, The list goes on and on. Whoever doesn't see this film as anything short of spectacular is either very hard to please or has no taste in movies. I was waiting for this movie to come out for ages and let me tell you it was well worth the wait! I will be one of many buying this film when it comes out on DVD :D Would also like to add I think Emily Browning is absolutely stunning in this.11 out of 10 :D",10,3,6,13 July 2011
