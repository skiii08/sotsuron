Black Swan," Black is black
","'Black Swan' presents, I think, a modern more updated definition of film noir (black or dark film) that existed in the 1940's and 50's. It is, indeed, a psychologically dark film as it attempts to recreate the ballet Swan Lake using Natalie Portman as the film's Swan queen. Blood, psychological torment, human cruelty and sexual perversion are its emphasis. If that makes you doubtful you want to see the film I do not blame you. I wondered why I made the effort.I do not mind if I have to go to some lengths to sift through a film and analyze its nuances but this one was too much for my psyche to absorb. When I read theater of the absurd authors such as Pirandello 'Six Characters in Search of an Author,' Samuel Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot,' or see a film based on the Edward Albee book 'Whose Afraid of Virginia Wolf' I can appreciate its absurdity, its torturous message of life's difficulty and even the extreme pathology of relationships at its core but at some point if the content gives me nothing else but a headache, I stop and ask why did I inflict this upon myself. Alright already I get the point! I do not like to be forced to analyze a film to death so that every word and every scene needs interpretation. In this film I kept asking what is reality, what is fantasy and what is simply a psychotic break. Is the woman insane, is the world around her insane or both? There were too many unknowns. I needed a film analyzer to sit next to me to explain the action and/or the symbolism of each scene.Some loved this movie and see brilliance in it. That may be so but it was much too enigmatic for me to waste my energy attempting to decipher it. Moreover, the rather graphic sex, utterly ugly bloody hard-to-fathom violence, allusions to maternal lesbian incest and other perversions including drug use made me uncomfortable. Watching the minutiae of it was, I thought, unnecessary and disconcerting. There were enough squirmy moments to make me turn my head and look away and ask why does a filmmaker have to show such graphic sexual detail and unhinged violence. I believe there are boundaries one should not cross. I do not want to see some things in living color because, in my opinion, it contributes to the crudity of our culture. I think the illusion of a sexual encounter is often times more erotic than its body machinations which leave nothing to the imagination.Having said all of that the film does show the complexity of ballet and its all encompassing art form to which some devote their entire life. If Natalie Portman did the dancing herself she is, indeed, a very good dancer. She is also an excellent actress. The part itself demanded hefty talent and she showed she had that and more. The performance often was riveting but the disgusting violent nature of the script, its graphic sexuality and twisted psychological content makes me give it a thumbs down. I loath fluff films too BUT I do not want utterly psycho-pathological, difficult-to-analyze and bloody ones either. I rather watch the swan boats on Boston Common in the spring instead!",2,7,14,18 January 2011
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," More than meets the eye
","Generally I enjoyed the film Borat. I was glad it was not longer than it was. Once one dramatizes humor about cultural differences one, I think, can take it only so far. At the end I kept saying alright already I get it! Having said that, however, I think the film has something poignant to say which belies the prevailing humor of its content.Some in the Jewish community, I have read, have refused to see the film because of its explicit and continuous anti-Semitism. Admittedly, some was hard to take. I am Jewish. I am extraordinarily sensitive to the history of anti-Semitism and the Jewish historical plight. It is because of that, I think, those who were offended by that element of the film miss the point of what the film was about. I think Sasha Baron Cohen, who is Jewish, was making a serious contention about cultural relativism. It doesn't matter where one comes from, hatred and ignorance is what it is no matter how you dress it up  or down.In part, I believe he was taking aim, too, at those in America who pride themselves as being an advanced western culture. Some in America have things in common with those in a seemingly backward country such as Kazakhstan. However stupid you may think those people are, there are those from an advanced society who will have many of the same attributes.Eastern Europe, Russia and the west have had virulently anti-Semitic histories. Anti-Semitism, has existed, too, in countries which have not had a long history of it. Anti-Semitism and racism, in general, know no cultural boundaries. It merely takes on a different face. The Jew as 'the other' has faced demonization nearly everywhere. Ancient canards about the Jew as the devil still incredibly prevail where people have not even met a Jew and where no Jews or few exist. A documentary film called 'The Longest Hatred' about the long history of anti-Semitism once said 'you do not need Jews to have anti-Semitism.' Three positive characters exist in the film. Two were orthodox Jews and one was a black prostitute. This was not accidental. Sasha Cohen tried, I think, to say something to defend those whom the majority still often think  for the most irrational reasons are the indefensible. People are still just people after all and one can find humanity in people and in places where you think none would exist.If others who are not Jewish take away from that movie the idea that Borat and the characters he meets are right about their world view, then there is little hope for those of us in this world who would like to extricate ourselves from the sewer of its stupidity and ignorance.",Null,4,7,20 November 2006
Inglourious Basterds," Glorious Basterds
","I am Jewish and I LOVED this film. I wasn't prepared to love it as I had heard about the violence which I often cannot endure but I did love the film. Why? I was born in 1948 after the greatest catastrophe, the Holocaust, was perpetrated on the Jewish people – my people. Thankfully, I never experienced it but year after year I absorbed the horror of it in film and by the word of mouth from parents and friends who knew about it or experienced themselves the evil that had befallen our people. I have viewed hundreds of hours of film footage of it, documentaries on it, bought and read books and anthologies about it, viewed TV drama devoting hours to it, viewed and participated in lengthy discussions and yet through all of that one burning question remains and it is not necessarily the word why. We can find thousands of rationales for the Holocaust but the question of what can we do about it remains illusive. As a naive child I said to my parents but we won the war as if that were the happy ending of it. The answer always was an unsatisfying yes we won the war but  .The trials at Nuremberg, the trial of Eichmann, the imprisonment and execution of some of the Nazi hierarchy to be sure was some satisfaction but not the kind of satisfaction I desired for such unpardonable and unspeakable crimes. I had to face reality. There was no revenge huge enough and there was certainly nothing that could bring back the cerebrally unfathomable six million. What does six million mean? It is an utterly incomprehensible number made even worse because it is a number that COULD have included me. Only an accident of location and time of birth made me a learner about and not a victim of those events at that horrible time. Still, there is no revenge which is able to give purpose to the purposeless. That is a hard reality for a Jew who was born in America to swallow. Are not the good guys supposed to win? Do not the bad guys get sent to hell? The answer is a discouraging no the good guys do not always prevail and no, the bad guys probably do not end up in hell. Truly there is no good ending for this incredible story.This film, though, albeit in fiction form, satisfied the desire for revenge for those dastardly deeds perpetrated within a historical minute slightly more than 65 years ago. The end of the film was the Dante's inferno for the Nazi curse. It was glorious to watch as hell by Jewish hands was visited upon the entire Nazi hierarchy including Hitler himself in the confines of a beautiful theater as if the entire war was played out right then and there on film and I rejoiced. I felt like I took a bath in flames that cleansed the world and me of one of man's most horrific crimes. It was as if God himself burned the screen, blew up the theater where Nazi big wigs sat and screamed to them this is Jewish revenge; this is Jewish punishment for what you have done. I loved it and wished it were true.Alas, it is not true though as it is a work of fiction. So afterward I am bounced back to reality yet again and know there is nothing I can or will be able to ever do about it. I can as a Jew never exact my pound of flesh but I did, for over two hours, feel as if I had. More, much more can be said about this film. I highly recommend it IF one understands the necessary violence of it.",10,5,12,29 January 2010
Spotlight," 'Spotlight': Why a free press matters
","I saw the film 'Spotlight' which is, as most likely know, a film about the Boston Globe's 'Spotlight' team's exposé of systemic pedophile sexual abuse of children by priests in the Catholic Church in Boston and the Church's cover-up complicity of it. Viewing it took courage as, quite frankly, some things despite the worldly horrors we are privy to each day, are so noxious, hypocritical and sickening that it takes fortitude to view the stories about it in detail.The film itself starring Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams was expertly crafted and the acting was without flaw. Happily, it did not reenact the many sickening crimes. Through a few adults re-telling their horrific experiences one could, I thought, cope with the retelling of their trauma. It was a seamless and truth-telling reenactment of the 'Spotlight' team's investigation of the Catholic Church's most impactful and nearly self-immolative destruction not only in Boston but ultimately all over the nation and even the world. The Globe's exposé was an earthquake indictment of an institution many thought sat next to God himself.Sadly, most institutions whether the Church or money-driven power-crazed government will sell their soul for a price and the Church paid a heavy price for doing just that transferring pedophile priests from parish to parish and 'treatment' centers to 'treatment' centers without a whisper to the authorities of the priestly crime of sexual abuse of minors lest it cast aspersions on a sacrosanct institution. The church remained in silent cover-up of itself despite its rape of so many young souls.I viewed it because I thought it important to do so much as I think it important to view the history of the Holocaust though it is difficult to do. We view these things so that light can be shown on silent darkness and so others may never know such crushing experiences again. 'Spotlight' is spotless in its focus and makes crystal clear why a free press matters. Without the exposure of these indelible crimes by the press they might never have seen the light of truthful day and nothing would ever change from one generation to the next.",10,2,4,27 November 2015
Midnight in Paris," Midnight in Paris -- a clever delight
","Woody Allen yet again serves up a thought provoking, entertaining and brilliant film. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Have you ever wondered if it would have been better to have been born in a previous era? Woody Allen helps us answer that question by having us time travel a bit through the experiences of a young writer attempting to publish his first work which has as its setting a memorabilia shop filled with things of bygone eras which interest him. In this era, however, he travels with his shallow fiancé and her conservative condescending parents to Paris where the hero is smitten with its beauty and culture. What his fiancé does not know is that at the stroke of midnight our protagonist is transported to another era -- the Roaring Twenties – complete with Cole Porter music, Ernest Hemingway literature, Picasso art and Gertrude Stein as critic of the book he has just written.This is a wonderful film especially if one has a general familiarity of the art, literature and music of that era as well as a general understanding of cultural settings in times other than our own. The film is brilliant and clever as only Woody Allen can be. The protagonist could certainly have been Woody Allen himself as he has played similar roles in many of his earlier works and if it were in a different era perhaps 20 years ago then Woody would have played the lead role instead of Owen Wilson whom I think was excellent.Allen's talent will endure long after all who have enjoyed the genre of his films have left the scene. He brings a flavor to his films that is unique to him and yet carries with it something that touches all of us by trying to understand the human condition, its philosophical dilemmas, its heartaches, its romantic love, its joys, its fears, its failures and its triumphs.Which era would you want to return? I always say the late 60's but 'Midnight in Paris' warns us each era has its problems and its vicissitudes as mankind tries to improve upon his historical condition from generation to generation. It, therefore, gives us pause for thought maybe the era in which we do live is the best era of all. It is surely the only one we know.",Null,7,14,14 July 2011
Life of Pi," Profound!
","The Life of Pi which we saw over the weekend appeals to those of who are plagued by the larger questions of life and its difficulty. It is a HUGELY profound film BUT one has to enjoy that type of intellectual challenge to take the time to analyze, walk through its weeds and see the depths of its thought. Reading what others say about it online is helpful to understand the depth and varying opinion about it. Some things about its essence were not clear to me. The more I thought about and discussed it with others who have seen it the more I can appreciate its brilliance. Ang Lee the director won the Oscar for best director. I surely can see why.I think to get the film's maximum experience one should see it, if possible, in a theater with 3D disposable glasses the theater hands out or view it in IMAX. Viewing it with 3D glasses makes it a stunning visual experience as one sees, for an example, birds flying in the most vivid color directly in front of you to touch. 3D makes Pi amazing.It is about man, animals, the universal creation and every living thing's challenge to survive within it. One sees life's diversity, gorgeous complexity but continuously asks why we as sentient understanding beings are left to forge though it seemingly alone with the constant companion of suffering and death.I believe the major thrust of the film is contained in the Biblical story Job. It is about man's quest to understand and give meaning to the vicissitudes of life without losing faith in a God in the face of life's table of tragedy spread out before us. It is man's quest to find the meaning in life to give it purpose and help us when we are weaker than what life visits upon us. The protagonist a young Indian boy named Pi Patel is constantly thinking about the same things and even becomes a Hindu, a Christian, a devotee of Islam and even Kaballa Judaism in his quest to seek personal answers and peace. The film is available On Demand on TV BUT without the 3D glasses one does not gets, the visually awestriking experience. I may see it again on TV so I can re-see the thoughtfulness behind the movie albeit not in as visually appealing form. I give this film a thumbs-up IF and ONLY IF those aforementioned things usurp your consciousness as they do mine and if you are prepared to think hard about what the film is offering. To some it may seem like a children's movie but I suggest it is far from that. It could be seen by children but they would not have the sophistication, ability to question life and the experiences of it that only an adult could possess.",9,2,5,18 March 2013
Little Miss Sunshine," I really loathed this film
","Perhaps I am unique. I simply do not for the life of me understand what people think is so wonderful about this film or why it is up for any Academy Award. I simply hated it. It was preposterous, ridiculous, inane, certainly profane and obnoxious. Okay, perhaps it said one should be who one is and persevere despite life's setbacks and with a loving family it will be much easier to get through the rough spots. I'll give it that. I suppose it had a message. Still, the way TO the message was insane.Moreover, something else bothered me. The role of the grandfather made me squirm. The fact that he was disgustingly profane and obnoxiously revolting was compounded by what he said in the company of his granddaughter. There was some kind of, I thought, weird incestuous suggestiveness that I was not at all comfortable with. Would anyone be comfortable with a grandfather who got kicked out of his condo, sniffed cocaine and advised his grandson to bed every woman he can, staying in a hotel room with their female child? The kiddy beauty pageant at the end put the child pornographic icing on the cake for me and it did so by trying to be hilarious about it. There is NOTHING funny about a child being placed in a Jean Benet Ramseyish adult sexual role. NOTHING. This film said and did some uncomfortable things and more than once I was tempted to walk out. I didn't but I wish I had. This film disgusted me.",1,2,5,28 January 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," I hated this film
",I know the film is based on a best seller. I loathed it and walked out after an animal was brutally killed.Sure the performances were good if one wants to watch brutality at its best. My friend read the book but knew that she would not want to see a film that portrayed the worst kind of violence. Why is our world nuts? Go to this flick and see! I will never understand why films of this nature appeal to people. Filmmakers obviously make a film that they know will sell. Ah for the films like 'The Days of Wine and Roses' or 'Rebel without a Cause' or 'The Apartment'...all of those films had substance. Today every year it seems they try to outdo the year before with disgusting extremist actions. sadomasochistic utter brutality in detail. I wanted to throw a rock though the screen. Now how non violent is that?! I want my money back!,1,6,17,30 January 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," Phenomenal Acting
","This was an excellently performed film and, indeed, about an era I remember well, but would, in fact, like to forget. It was a time when the gay male friends I knew were feared even by me--a lifetime lefty liberal seemingly humane and empathetic. I remember reading the headlines of this new so called 'gay cancer' that grabbed my attention as I made sure not to drink from my gay male friend's glass or even let him use my soap. I am ashamed of all this now. We did not know and let fear and stupidity rule the day like Arthur Miller's crucible told of witches, and demons and man's feeble attempt to deal with that which he did not understand. We think in our era we are better than that but no I suspect we are the same as we continue to see the other demonized and even killed.This film, a true story, is as riveting as it is sad. Sad that we as a nation wasted precious time because we could not look at the ugliness of AIDS and we could not stop thinking it was a gay disease. It wasn't just a gay disease it was an every man's disease as the virus made no exception just for gays. So many would not touch those we deemed untouchable. It was an era of ignorance, hatred, and vicious homophobia as if it were not enough that gays of that time hated themselves and did not need the mark of Cain or the scarlet letter to fuel the fans of hatred already entrenched.Matthew McConaughey was brilliant. The Best Actor Academy Award category will be a hard one from which to choose, indeed, as those nominated are excellent in their own right but McConaughey is no less so. Jared Leto as supporting actor won the Golden Globe award and may win the Academy Award as well. He was superb. This may be a difficult to watch film but it is a necessary to watch film as we try, however, feebly, to exorcise our own demons and frailties from our souls.",10,2,3,9 February 2014
The Theory of Everything," The Theory of Everything
","If there is another film that I have enjoyed more than 'The Theory of Everything' I do not know what it is and throughout my life have seen hundreds of films.'The Theory of Everything' is a biographical sketch of Stephen Hawking, the Einsteinian astrophysicist genius diagnosed with the neuro-motor degenerative disease, ALS. When diagnosed as a young man he was given two years to live. He is now 72 defying the odds. Stephen Hawking remains one of human history's most phenomenal minds of science and one of the most profound contributors to the science of astrophysics.Eddie Redmayne, as Stephen Hawking, deserved the Oscar for best actor and then some. His portrayal of a man with this degenerative disease was nothing short of brilliant. He turned into Stephen Hawking as I forgot, most of the time, this was an actor portraying him. Felicity Jones as Hawking's wife was excellently performed as well. One must, I think, see this film to grasp its all-encompassing resplendence.'The Theory of Everything' speaks to the deepest most enduring and profound questions of life -- how did we, our planet, and indeed the universe begin and will it end. It asks, too, the most unanswerable question -- why. 'The Theory of Everything' of course cannot answer everything but man's big brain can make the generational attempt to try. Every day we live we see the relevance of physics and the leaps forward in history science has made.For those who love relationship films it had that too. His wife Jane's dedication to him through much of his ordeal was breathtaking. Having three children with him amid the onslaught of the disease defied credulity.In the end the message of the film speaks loud and clear to me as Hawking, through his voice synthesizer states: 'Where there is life there is hope!' Indeed, the life of Stephen Hawking proves that hypothesis eminently true.",10,1,2,20 March 2015
Lincoln," Masterpiece
","Stephen Spielberg's 'Lincoln' is yet another masterpiece from the master. It is one of the best snapshots of our 16th president and the social milieu in which he lived that I have ever seen. It concentrates on Lincoln as president toward the end of the Civil War and the machinations between Congress and him to pass the 13th Amendment to the Constitution eliminating slavery from our national reality. Daniel Day Lewis as President Lincoln and Sally Fields as Mary Todd Lincoln are brilliant as is Tommy Lee Jones in the part of Thaddeus Stevens the great orator of the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania and fierce proponent of abolition.A refresher course on the 13th Amendment content:Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.Section 2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.One can understand by attempts to pass present-day legislation how difficult it actually is and the compromises it takes to pass it as events on the ground unfold. Outlawing slavery by passing the 13th Constitutional Amendment was, to say the least, a Herculean task. Our racist past still even now digs its heels into the cement of our national architectural landscape. It lives on in generational perpetuity gumming up the works in our attempt to create a more perfect union. Through this excellent film one can see the nature of our racist roots, the brilliance of Lincoln as he overrules many in his own party to force Congress into passing the 13th Amendment. One can see that which divided us then still divides us now albeit in different form through a quite different Republican Party hardly, now, the party of Lincoln.This is a must see for those who love watching the arc of history as it bends, slowly, towards justice. The film's creators spared us the view of Lincoln's assassination but rather cut to an announcement of its occurrence at another Washington theater. We hear Edwin Stanton, Secretary of War, at the president's bedside uttering history's memorable quote: 'Now he belongs to the ages.' And so he does as history marches forward from then to now and our election of the first African American president not once but twice resoundingly so. Not surprisingly it made me cry as I thought about my own efforts to support our first African American president and how thrilled I am to be apart of this nation's efforts to perfect this union. This film presented the Civil War era and the Lincoln presidency as a reflective mirror of our nation's past that lives today and is not only relegated to the south but occupies a major wing of a major party continually seeking immense power in every state taking advantage of the lesser angels of our nature to do so. It is up to us, in my view, to make sure they do not attain power so as Lincoln in his Gettysburg address so artfully said about the massive amount of Civil War dead  'that these dead shall not have died in vain!'",10,4,9,18 November 2012
Children of Men," The more I thought about it the more I loved Children of Men
","The more I thought about 'Children of Men' the more I loved it. The DVD discussion by the director and others certainly helped to get a clearer understanding of the director's intent. It is a supremely Orwellian film, bleak and violent, which had much to say about the nature of man and culture. It is a film that begs for discussion. The somewhat simple story of the film cannot be divorced from the complexity of its landscape. Each would be nothing without the other and special attention should be paid to the movie's setting.The movie takes place in the not-too-distant future making technological chaos a part of its surroundings. It centers on the world's inability to generate children, its lack of ability to understand why and the consequences this has for the disintegration of population, culture, history and life itself. The bleak surroundings of decay are omnipresent. It is testament, I think, to what happens when constant war and anarchy prevail. Society deconstructs. In society's vain attempt to perpetuate and sustain itself through repressive force it does neither. Stability is always elusive. One social and political philosophy is like another and the only thing left for the state to do is to perpetuate its media driven lies in some withering attempt to maintain order through tyranny. No one has the answer even though some think they do. The less powerful, of course, succumb to the Darwinian forces of nature. It is dinosaurian. If one force doesn't kill there is always another right around the corner which will. There is no rhyme or reason to it all. Humanity is prostrate before forces no one can control and man is at the mercy of other men and fate itself.This movie poses many interrogatives. What happens to human society when biological and/or socially catastrophic events interfere with the natural orderly progression of life? How do humans adapt and survive or can they adapt at all? What happens when chaos reigns and people are in a constant state of war and anarchy? If social conflict is perpetual are human beings inclined toward constructing a totalitarian state? Who suffers and why? Is utopia a possibility ... ever? Is there hope? This film, I thought, was phenomenally relevant to the world in which we find ourselves. Perhaps, it is a film for all seasons as well. It could apply to Nazi Germany to Bosnia, to Lebanon, Darfur and most certainly to Iraq or, indeed, to any place which is prey to biological and other catastrophic events which give rise to chaos. The author perceptively places this film in Britain. I think this says it could apply to western culture as well IF we do not stop those forces which are brewing a perfect storm of biological catastrophe and social fracture. The very survival of life as we know it on our planet is at stake.This film, although it is quite starkly bleak, does offer some hope through the only woman in the world who is pregnant. Amid this primordial social ooze and against all odds she attempts, with the help of one man, to save her infant's life. One must be patient and wait to see if there is an ultimate ray of light at the end of the tunnel. I recommend this film highly to those who want entertainment through serious thought provoking art.Natalie Rosen, Framingham, MA",9,6,10,1 May 2007
The Imitation Game," Wonderful and contemporaneously inspiring
","'Sometimes it's the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine' – The Imitation Game This film is inspiring on many different levels. It is a chapter of WWII of which I was unaware. The German code breakers and their brilliant analysis of what was prudent to strike and what was not was simply amazing.It shows one why fascism political, religious or otherwise cannot be allowed to win the day. In WWII the time in which the film takes place, western civilization and true democracy hung by a thread.The British code breaker mathematical genius Alan Turing saved our proverbial necks from fascism's tyranny! Suggested reading: 'It Can Happen Here' by Sinclair Lewis. Alan Turning got a raw deal and his maltreatment was in no small part because of who he was -- gay at a time when not only was it criminal but your body could be medically attacked for it. Thank you Alan Turning for showing us why our treatment of gays had to change and thank you for doing nothing more than saving western civilization! We owe you a huge apology.It CAN happen here and we have the extremists to prove it.",10,0,1,13 July 2015
Selma," 'Selma'—a film Review—God at his side
","No need to beat around the proverbial bush I loved this film. It took the highlights of the Alabama Edmund Pettus Bridge march for equality and the struggle for civil rights nearly fifty years ago and turned it into a film masterpiece.This amazing non-violent man, Dr. Martin Luther King, did things to improve the lives of millions; things that no one would or could have done and he did so in the face of humiliating provocation, hubristic insult and the crushing brutality by the forces of malevolence few could endure. He turned the other cheek for the haters to smash as well.This film shows to those who knew him and to the youth who can only study about him the inspirational charisma he possessed. He brought hope to hopeless millions and changed centuries of misery's darkness into the possibility of freedom's light. He brought his power to a recalcitrant, mean and vicious slice of oppositional white power and galvanized a nation of all colors, religions, and creeds to his moral cause.We saw, through the communicative media of the time, the Edmund Pettus Bridge walkers bludgeoned when they tried to cross it by white and Confederate flag-flying racists as Dr. King forged a path for those that walked with him toward a better life.People say for all the world to hear malevolent and mendacious things whether there is evidence for it or not against the giants of men and women upon whose shoulders we stand for the progress of mankind.The larger truth was that a David honed justice against a Goliath of Billy clubs and bats. 'Selma' was a snap shot of that time. It was a time of attack dogs, fire hoses and police Billy clubs used on old men, old women, children and anything black (and sometimes white) that got in the way of a white life of privilege. Persons of color wanted to merely sit anywhere on a bus, anywhere in a movie theater, at any lunch counter or, indeed, the right to vote free of literacy tests no one could pass and poll taxes many not afford.Dr. King helped extricate his people as the metaphorical Moses of Biblical antiquity allegedly led the slaves out of Egypt. He was historically huge and this film portrayed him as that. I do not care about his personal life that some scurrilously impugn nor do I care about small poetic justice historical error there may in the film. I care about what Dr. King did for those who lived under the jackboot of a backward brutal south that tried to crush people of color for any invented reason they could think.The movie, 'Selma' was great. We who empathize with those who suffer injustice and who are on the side of the arc of justice as it bends towards it will love this film for the truth it brings.The lessons, though, are for our time as well. Again the shouts of injustice fall on seemingly deaf ears. The deaths of innocent Black men whether at the site of a burning cross, at the base of a Poplar tree or at the hands of some present-day bully can be seen in our nation now. Voter suppression, intimidation and hardship with the most egregious 'conservative' Supreme Court nullification of the most important part of the 1965 Voting Right Act exist in our time. They have now the blood on their hands that so many shed to attain what rightfully should be America's promise to everyone. The efforts of Dr. King and those who followed cannot have been in vain.On Martin Luther King Day I say rest in peace, Dr. King, and may you be for all time at the side of the God in whom you believed!",9,4,11,19 January 2015
It's a Wonderful Life," 'It's a Wonderful Life' – A Wonderful Timeless Film
","Turning the channels on Christmas Eve and/or Christmas day can be an unrewarding endeavor. The channels are dedicated to a great deal of silliness, infomercials and repeats of news stories seen over and over again.As luck would have it, though, I tuned onto a film that, yes, I have seen many times before but this time I looked upon it with different, perhaps, more mature eyes. To be honest, there are times when I have not been happy with my life, not happy with the difficulties of aging, losing so many I love and surely not happy I contracted a malady at 5 years of age which no one in this nation, thankfully, need suffer from again. I am glad for them, of course, but honesty must be spoken as I admit I wish I were born a mere six months after a vaccine for my malady was produced. When I kvetch (Yiddish for complain) about it I was told by one wise person in my life that I really should view James Stewart over again as George Bailey in 'It's a Wonderful Life' and that it might teach me the essence of what is so valuable about my own life. On Christmas Eve 'It's a Wonderful Life' was shown again.The film speaks to people – really most people – whether one is a believer in a supreme being or not. George Bailey, ready for suicide as his life's events spin out of his control and is ready to jump off a bridge into icy waters below. Ultimately, he is shown by Clarence, his guardian angel, why he should not cease to exist and what life would have been like had he never existed at all; had he not even been born.George Bailey's life, despite its overwhelmingly disastrous turn of events, counts. Yes, disbelief must be suspended but if one does suspend it the film teaches us that lesson. Most all lives count because in each life a person touches others in good ways one might never have imagined. The metaphor of a pebble thrown into a lake creating ripples far off from its point of origin is apropos. It says you mean something and you change lives – hopefully for the better – simply by your existence.'It's a Wonderful Life' is a wonderful timeless film that has a message, I think, for many of us whether we get the things in life we wanted, and most especially, if we do not.",10,1,3,26 December 2015
Zero Dark Thirty," A Masterpiece
","I cannot possibly write a spoiler as if everyone does not know the outcome of this film then they have been hiding under a rock. Still I will make my comments general. Probably I should have given this docudrama a 10. I did not because the film has been criticized by some especially on the left who are much more knowledgeable than I am about the details of the operation.In view of that I will give my high review a caveat. That caveat is that I wonder if the details of the film are absolutely accurate. Did the US use torture which includes water-boarding and SO much more? If so did that use of torture lead to revealing the details about bin Laden's courier leading directly to him. These two questions are pivotal.STILL no matter what the veracity is concerning my two questions, the technological expertise of this film is a thing to behold. I am amazed on two levels. The first is that the film maker took such pains I believe to get the details correct AND I am awestruck by the nerves of steel of those who were involved in the planning of it and the US military who had nerves of steel conducting it. Ultimately, though, it needed the all systems go from the president. He gave it although the film showed nothing of the president but one knows in the final analysis of the mission if it failed he would have been blamed entirely! I suspect the filmmakers did not want to make this a political pro Obama statement. I thank the US military, the president's advisers and the president himself for their incredible pursuit and acquisition of intel to capture the world's most wanted man!",9,7,28,7 January 2013
12 Years a Slave," Excellence in Truth
","This weekend I had the grim opportunity to see '12 Years a Slave' based on the true story and written work of a free African, Solomon Northup, in 1841. Northup, a great African American violinist and musical talent living as a freeman in the north, gets apprehended by thugs and sent back into slavery in the 1841 south. If one sees that film, which I HIGHLY encourage, and really understands it one will be guaranteed a true perspective on the etiology of our nation's historical white racist albatross. The old Confederacy is dead BUT the white Tea Bag Republican Party is determined to keep its malevolent heart beating and the major Republican Party is more than willing to use these know nothing Tea Baggers to attain power for the rich who so desperately want it.If one sees this film one will know why, if you do not already, our first African American president is disrespected and pilloried attempting to crush everything he proposes whether his nomination of judges or of his signature legislation the Affordable Healthcare Act by those who wave the Confederate flag proudly and those rich white men within the Republican Party echelons of power who allow these malevolent malcontents within their ranks to exist undeterred.This film is a window into the American soul. The nation armed with its document of freedom and egalitarian treatment for all can reduce this precious document to refuse. It is impossible to understand how African Americans could even survive the onslaught of a system that degraded and reduced their status to beasts of burden; property that whites could kill or use at will. One sees, through this film, man's inhumanity to man EVEN in a country which purports to know better. The hypocrisy is endless and the cruelty of white masters toward their black property knows no boundaries.It mattered not whether one was a black man or a black woman as each were treated with unfathomable cruelty in his/her own uniquely vulnerable way. Both sexes endured the lash but the female had to endure the lash and the humiliation of loveless, brutal and savage rape by her white master and could do not a thing about it. It can be said and Todd Aiken who made the preposterous statement that a woman can shut down a pregnancy if she is raped that unequivocally biology knows no difference between impregnation by love or by rape as the many light-skinned blacks of that era could attest. This is what it is like when men because of who they are have no rights and where other men can lord over them, strip them of rights, strip them of the vote and strip them of the humanity of human dignity based solely on who they were born.The film has great relevance to our day. Republican whites, as in the era of Jim Crow, try their best to deny, by any means necessary, the vote to those blacks and others who would attempt to vote those into office who would have their interests at heart.This film instructs us today NOT to let racists within our ranks gain traction and win electorally through rancid policy that which they could not win through a Civil War that crushed them two centuries ago. The Old Confederacy has morphed into a new and ugly monster that will rise again ONLY if we of egalitarian principle let it. WE WILL NOT LET IT RISE AGAIN NOT THIS TIME and take us back as they did Solomon Nothrup to the bestial era of the 1841 south. They must be roundly defeated not only for persons of color but for all of us including women whose power WILL be nullified by right wing extremists who have only hate and religious dogma in their hearts. They will take us back to the 19th century and even, as one Nevada know nothing legislator said, vote to take us back to slavery if the public wants it. According to the Las Vegas Sun, Jim Wheeler of Gardnerville, NV was speaking to the Storey County Republican Party when he made the remarks. That remark says it all as does the remark in the film of Brad Pitt abolitionist white plantation worker when he says of the corrupt and bestial slave system: 'Thou devil, sooner or later, somewhere in the course of eternal justice, thou shalt answer for this sin!'' And so they have but, in my opinion, not nearly enough!",10,5,10,4 November 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," DeCaprio and Jonah Hill are brilliant -- our nation through the prism of greed
","Where did the three hours go? It was a very long film which I utterly LOVED. The time flew by. The performances were riveting and dazzling. Leonardo DiCaprio proves over and over again to me just how superb an actor he is. I believe he has not gotten the recognition he deserves. Glad he received the Golden Globe and hope he receives the Academy Award. He is probably among difficult competition but he surely will be in contention. The foreign press gave him the Globe for best actor in a comedy. I was surprised about the comedy part but after seeing the film, my sides hurt from laughing so much. Does it glorify Wall Street? NOT from my perspective. I think it makes fun of Wall Street by its never- ending Roman orgy like spectacle. If one is offended by bad language, tons of sex, tons of nudity and drugs galore than this is, perhaps, not the film for you. I,however, a constant critic of Wall Street, thought this film indicts it like no other has and by the way Margot Robbie is drop dead gorgeous!I do not know, however, how either the actors or the real life perpetrators of this Roman orgy investment insanity came out alive.Incredible entertainment that says something as only Martin Scorsese can about the nature of our nation. It is one of his best!",10,7,17,13 January 2014
Defiance," The Excellence and Brilliance of Defiance -- my continuing dilemma
","I have probably seen every Holocaust film known to man. Based on a true story, Defiance it is about a group of Jews in Beylorus who actually lived in the forest in 1941 for 2 years trying to evade capture by the Nazis and the Nazis often Polish and other helpers. It is thrilling, captivating, gut wrenching and the truth of it makes it all the more so. It has a bit of a positive end although you would NOT think so leading up to it, of course.The Holocaust is MY yardstick for all that I believe and it is the heart of my feeling about the Jewish people. It is MORE much more than about religious belief of which I have little but it is its moral, survival, ethical, political essence that grabs me. It pierces my heart like nothing else can. It is why I used to hold Israel to a higher standard because we are a people whose history has been saturated with sadness and onslaught. We have been plagued, hunted, tortured, crushed and slaughtered during the past 2000 years and ultimately the object of the greatest mass murder humanity has ever seen bar none. It has EVERYTHING to teach and yet it has NOTHING to teach as man does what he does again and again and again all over the world.Every time I see another film about the Holocaust I wax staggered by the ENORMITY of it. My eyes do not want to believe what I see and I go to bed feeling guilty that I sleep warm, am fed well and have survived in comfort. I am chilled by the fact that had all my grandparents stayed where they were they could have been among those Jews who ran through the forest in spring, summer, winter and fall just to survive and IF they did not they would have been killed in concentration camps. It is a testament to man's yearning to survive and be free and it extends to all people everywhere. It is again when I dissect the politics that is Israel I can see WHY the Jewish heart is so brutal in determination never to let that happen again AND YET I cannot understand HOW in VIEW of what happened some can run roughshod over those sometimes innocent next door. THAT is my cerebral conundrum with which I cannot come to terms.We all look at life through our own lens but the Jewish life is, in my opinion, like no other. Suffering is NOT limited to the Jew, certainly, but a Jewish life throughout the centuries could never find a home and could simply never just be. The Holocaust MUST be a ruler -- a moral prism -- by which everyone measures his capacity for good and evil and what behavior is permissible and what is not. It is MY eternal dilemma of conscience. I recommend this film if you haven't seen it because it gives life to the meaning of the ultimate catastrophe in ways which no other film I can remember has. It should have universal meaning for us all.",10,1,3,3 July 2009
The Good Shepherd," The Good Shepard
","I think I enjoyed this film more than most. Perhaps I enjoyed it because I am a very political person and think so often about national and international issues. I am constantly trying to figure out which side is really right. It seems each decade I change my mind. Perhaps it is because history and its analyses change from era to era. With the exception of the moral superiority of WWII, US policy becomes, I think, questionable, throughout the cold war era and beyond. Perhaps no one is all right and no one is all wrong. This country has done some nasty things BUT so has every other country. International politics is not soft and cuddly and if one needs a teddy bear I suggest the CIA, FBI, etc. is not for you. This film, I agree, seems not to take a firm stand although it surely does give one pause as to US interrogation techniques. I think one can relate much to contemporary events and arguments against (and for) torture.The definite flaw, in my opinion, is the aging process of the actors. Angelina Jolie remains twenty something from decade to decade as does Matt Damon as does Tammy Blanchard and others. It was hard to tell the difference between the ages of Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie's and their son. That made it hard to follow and believe.I did love the performances though and I loved the subject matter despite the film's lack of statement. Perhaps every film does not have to hit one over the head (so to speak) telling us a definitive point of view but rather should spark discussion of, in this case, power politics and its necessary bedfellow -- immorality. How far would one go to protect oneself, one's family or one's country even if it meant that you had to commit an immoral act to do it? That is a good question and I cannot think of a better time in history to ask it. A warning: It is a long film but I did not look at my watch once!",6,1,2,11 January 2007
The Big Short," Greatest Fraud Ever Told
","There is so much politically economic -- basically everything -- from foreign policy to economic banking and trade policy that has raped the little guy and this film addresses one of the greatest economic frauds in the nation's history that is at the heart of much of the nation's woes. The Great Recession of 2007 had the potential to revisit the Great Depression on steroids. The film explained some of the complex minutiae of it defining the mortgage backed securities fraud that was at the epicenter of it and explaining some things like CDS (Credit Default Swaps), CDOs (Colateralized Debt Obligations), sub-prime loans and worthless mortgage backed securities through persons who knew the collapse would happen years before it actually did.This gargantuan complex fraud had the attendant potential to collapse not only the US economy but the world economy and even end the capitalist system as we know it. Yes, we were that close until the US government, funded by you and me, bailed out the too-big-to-fail banks that created the fraud and allowed their CEO's to collect bonuses to boot. They put the 99% in a sink hole leaving us to drown in the muck they created as they sped away in their yachts toting their money bags in hand. Their profits tricked down to nowhere but themselves.The film was not boring, it was precise and tried to explain the complexity of what happened and how trillions of bucks were lost, millions of jobs were lost and millions more homes were lost relegating many to live on the street at the mercy of what the immoral predatory banksters had perpetrated.It was and still, in part, is an unhappy time, a catastrophic time and no one from the Wall Street that perpetrated the greatest fraud has been jailed ... yet. Instead they were rewarded, collected their bonuses and knew that if the system collapsed again the government would come to their rescue and bail them out saving their banks moral hazard be damned.Every sector of our nation, I believe, bears the DNA of this gargantuan fraud. Wall Street knew Congress, which most understand is bought by Wall Street, would never let it fail and so it continues albeit with some changes dressed somewhat differently but still keeps the 1% fat cats happy knowing that Congress will be there to provide the safety net should the nation stand on the catastrophic precipice they create again. The Glass-Stegall Act of 1933 having been repealed in 1999 makes unregulated Wall Street economic anarchy a recipe for disaster yet again.The film is blood pressure raising but understanding what occurred is a must if we are to fix that which is so broken in our nation and by doing so never allow this to happen again. It can, I believe, be done but will NOT be done by electing the very same persons of the same political stripes that perpetrated the greatest fraud ever told.",9,0,0,31 January 2016
The Queen," Very Interesting and fabulous performances
","I absolutely loved this film. It was riveting and the performances were superb. Helen Miren is an accomplished actress and at times I forgot it was she impersonating the English queen and thought it was the queen herself. Those Windsors are a trip alright. They come complete with ice water veins, snobby brains, and hearts made of lead. With respect to Diana they obviously experienced a combination of a hereditary traditional instinct and simply plain old jealousy toward a woman who exuded love and received it from people all over the world. The Windors, none of them, could compete with that and are quite the opposite of it. It is a mystery why Charles, who perhaps showed at least a little bit of feeling and empathy, went for Camilla Parker Bowles and not for the captivating Diana. I suppose love is indeed a mystery. I was, though, enthralled by them as I tried to figure out what made them tick.The concept of royalty is alien to most Americans although we do have reasonable facsimiles thereof. Still, English royalty is a different phenomenon. It simply makes me laugh. It is a mystery why the English still hold on to this vestige. I guess it is because of national pride, identity and a sense of continuity. These idle rich though have personalities like fish and cost the English people a fortune!",9,1,5,31 October 2006
Saving Mr. Banks," LOVED this film more than I ever thought I would
","A film about the making of Mary Poppins seemed at first not to interest me. I was 15 when the real Mary Poppins film came out, much too old to think of it as teenage fare but my neighbor next door five years younger than I kept singing and singing and singing 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.' Who knew the story behind the story of the making of this movie? This was one of the best films I have seen this year, right up there (although a different film) with the excellence of '12 Years a Slave.' It has a depth I never in a million years thought it would have had. No spoilers here because truly one has to see it to appreciate its heft. I loved every minute of it. Kudos to Tom Hanks, Emma Thompson and all the rest who played major (and minor) parts. Each was wonderful. It is a touching, sad, beautiful and uplifting film. One can only hope more films such as this would be made where gratuitous sex, profanity and violent mayhem are absent. Hallelujah, it's about time!",10,0,1,30 March 2014
Munich," GREAT film
","This was a wonderfully executed film. I am Jewish and it touched me deeply. Contrary to what one would think, Spielberg gave air time to both sides. His main premise, as I interpret it, is that the tit for tat killings are futile and neverending. The participants are caught up in a constant search for revenge with no end in sight. They are never free of fear. By proxy too the world is caught up in it as well and is never free either. Spielberg conveys that each side (Palestinian and Israeli) have justifiable anger. I agree with Spielberg it is simply a dangerous and impossible struggle. So many innocent people are caught in the line of fire and it affects one psychologically beyond repair. Still, as a Jew, my empathy lies with the character that said he cared about Jewish blood only. The Holocaust taints my perspective and I am sympathetic to the Israeli hierarchy caught between KNOWING that this is never ending and the righteousness of the Jewish heart wrenching historical experience and therefore its cause. At the end, I too, even with all the suffering, danger and loss of life cared about Jewish blood more than the others. THAT to me is evidence of how strong the passions are if one has the knowledge of the futility and endless violence but still can push even that aside and feel satisfaction when Israelis prevail!",10,3,9,27 December 2005
The Fighter," A quick opinion--TERRIFIC!
","Utterly excellent film, realistic and the performances perfect. What a difficult choice for the Oscar between the King's Speech and this a totally different film but based on a true story.I was so caught up in the excitement of it, I do not know where the time went. The film was absolutely funny and serious at the same time. It gives you a feeling for how devastating and corrupting addiction can be. It also has a statement about family. As internally combustible as the family was they still loved each other in their own way. They used and abused each other but they were there for one another. The community of Lowell is probably not unlike many blue collar and poverty stricken areas. One gets insight into the mentality, the anti intellectualism of it but the love of it too. It was these two feelings of the hardness of life but the love of family and support of it no matter how dysfunctional. If you ever think your family is difficult watch the film. Very humorous too in many ways.I suppose the boxing arena is a metaphor as well for the rough and tumble clawing of life to try to be a success and never giving up even when you think you cannot go another mile you do. Where there is life there is hope.Just loved this film and if it were earlier I would related more but just getting my feelings about the film out I give it a 10!",10,2,5,26 February 2011
