The Incredible Hulk," Wow!
",After the huge letdown of Ang Lee's HULK i was expecting another flat Hulk movie. This one was fantastic. It basically re-invents the Hulk franchise. There's a nifty little nod to the Hulk TV show opening also. Ed Norton scores as Bruce Banner. Liv Tyle is good as Betty and Tim Roth is awesome. Why isn't this guy a big star? This is a non-stop adrenaline rush...cool chase scenes with Bruce Banner and amazing Hulk action set pieces make this Hulk a truly entertaining and promising start to another big Marvel franchise. There's a few cool surprise cameos in the film too. I wont give away the surprises...although one of the TV spots does (!!!!!),9,2,4,14 June 2008
The Happening," Ummmmmmm......Huh? Awful
","It's official. I am kicking the habit of going into an M. Night Shyamalan film expecting it to be good. This movies stared out with such good promise and the visuals of people randomly and suddenly killing themselves was eerie and compelling. But then we have to suffer through poorly conceived (and poorly acted) characters and the most ridiculous and almost laughable plot (killer trees/wind/environment). The idea of outrunning the wind! OMG. Did Paul Verhoven direct this? Lol. The audience in my theater was laughing at times (in all the wrong places). It treads dangerously on SHOWGIRLS type camp at times. Not good at all, except for the beginning. I like Mark Wahlberg but he was so flat in this movie. Stay away from this and wait to watch it on demand (should be available on home video real fast)",3,3,7,14 June 2008
