The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Mockingjay needed to be split into parts
","As someone who has read the books, watching it come to life in film has been nothing but exciting. For me, the first part of Mockingjay was the least exciting of all (I still really enjoyed it, I'm just saying compared to the others). You have to remember that this is not just the first half of a story, it is the last part of the series, so this part is not meant to be exciting and action packed, it is to bring you back to Katniss and prepare you for the end. I feel like they did not have much of a choice, if Mockingjay was one whole film there would have been too many crucial part cut out or it would be a very long film. I am sure people that did not read the books might be OK with that because Francis Lawrence can make anything work, but I am sure Suzanne knew that this was something that had to be taken apart to be right. I love this series, I love the cast, so I did love Mockingjay Part 1, it is not my absolute favourite (Catching Fire is) but, looking at it as a Part 1 movie, it was amazing. I was so impressed with how they changed some things to add excitement in the film, it was enjoyable as a viewer. I cannot wait to see the next part and watch everything fall in place.",8,3,25,5 December 2014
The Maze Runner," Mixed feelings.
","So, I went to watch this movie twice at the theatre. Surprisingly, after enjoying it the first time, I left the second time with mixed emotions. I genuinely enjoyed it the first time (obviously why I went again when I was offered), it was suspenseful and interesting. I loved that the protagonist was a male, and the whole maze concept was intriguing. After the second time, I realized a lot of problems with the film and why I was disappointed. A good movie should never leave you with as many questions as this one did! The main character, Thomas, is a 'hero' but really is not...he is part of WCKD and now he is with the kids they tested on? The only girl in the movie, Teresa, is weak and boring (she reminds me of Bella in Twilight). Why is she the only girl?! It never explains the note. Why does everything go wrong when Thomas comes? The only character that I have a connection to is Chuck, barely. There needs to be an emotional investment with the main characters. Speaking of main characters, I felt like they should have made more of the other guys more important. I have so many questions about this whole world and system and I was so mad that they barely answered them. I don't mean to attack the film, I just feel like this could have been a much stronger franchise, unfortunately it is not going to be unless they fix it in scorch trials.",6,0,1,7 October 2014
Interstellar," A film I will never forget
","Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors and is a creative genius. The Nolan brothers have the best writing talent I've ever seen, the screenplay was perfection. This movie as a whole was something I cannot put into words. After watching Gravity last year, which I enjoyed, I expected the film to be similar. I was VERY wrong. This film not only entertained me from beginning to start, it challenged your mind as you watched, made you question the simplest things in life, made you feel like you were there. There was a lot of hype on this film when the trailers went out and I am so glad how little they showed you because I really did not know what to expect, but this film turned out to be one of my favourites. One of the best castings I have seen in a while, which is probably another reason I loved it so much. I also enjoyed the comedic lines here and there to lighten the mood. Overall, an amazing piece of art. See you at the Oscars!",9,1,4,5 December 2014
Quantum of Solace," A sequel to Casino Royale
","Undoubtedly, this film was just continuing off of Casino Royale by getting revenge for what happened. BUT, this was necessary to make. Daniel Craig's Bond is just starting out as 007 and there is a lot going on that changes the character into the Bond we know and love. I feel that this movie makes you really feel for him because you understand why he acts like he does. Now, I was a little mad watching it because this is not a Bond movie at all, but I realized that it wouldn't make sense if it was. This is the turning point for him. We have the idea of a Bond film in our brains and I can see why some people would be upset after watching the film, but just be understanding of the context of this movie.",7,0,2,22 December 2014
Big Hero 6," Oscar Worthy
","I know for a fact that it will be nominated for Best Animation at the 2015 Oscars, no doubt. After the princess high I am sure everyone was on after Frozen, it was nice to see a Disney film with a male lead and about hi tech/engineering (Obviously not the first, I just enjoyed seeing this). This film had action, enough emotion to make you want to cry, and some seriously funny lines that had most of the adults in the audience laughing. Disney has really found it's way of really being for all ages, I went with my boyfriend and there was just as many older couples as families. This movie was not just a film to entertain, it was a push for kids to create, Who didn't want to build their own Baymax after watching this?!",9,28,43,5 December 2014
