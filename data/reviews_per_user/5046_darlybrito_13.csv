The Incredible Hulk," Incredible Movie
","I got so mad when I went to see this movie on opening weekend because a blackout came and ruin everything. I left the movie probably half way and I was irritated. There was no way that the movie will start immediately so everybody left and obviously with their refund. The theater was close for a few hours so I knew I had to come the next weekend. Then comes next weekend and I still had in mine that I was going to watch about 30 minutes into the movie again, but I didn't care, it was a great 30 minutes.I was hoping this hulk movie to be more action-packed than Ang Lee's The Hulk. I wanted a true hulk movie and close enough towards its comic book. That's what the original didn't have and that's what The Incredible Hulk has.The Incredible Hulk brings a new everything to the big screen; cast, director, story, etc. This time, Edward Norton (Bruce Banner) is in South America (Brazil) trying to find a cure for the gamma radiation that destroyed his cells and turns him into a totally different person when he is irritated and angry. Meanwhile, William Hurt (General Thunderbolt Ross) is on Banner's tail when he finds out that Banner is in Brazil. All hell breaks lose when Thunderbolt Ross brings a pack of U.S. soldiers to capture Banner. Things then get even uglier when a new powerful monster known as The Abomination causes chaos on anybody who steps on his way.I really like the beginning of the movie because it was short and sweet to the point. It explains the events that happened in Bruce Banner's lab incident in seconds. Unlike Ang Lee's The Hulk when it probably took 30 or more minutes to explain the whole thing.The new cast did an amazing job in the movie, especially Edward Norton. He did a great as Bruce Banner. Before, I was not sure if this was the right choice, but now I'm definitely sure it was. I also thought Liv Tyler gave a good performance as Betty Ross. She gave a solid performance as I expected. Tim Roth and William Hurt did their job too. Roth did great as Emil Blonsky.Besides the story and acting, I thought the action and special effects were incredible. The action sequences between the hulk and military were amazing, but the final battle was so damn fun and great to watch. I totally think the Abomination and hulk fight should win an award for best fight.Overall, The Incredible Hulk is one of the best superhero movies of all-time and I'm sure hulk fans will not be disappointed.",10,3,5,29 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Great Movie
","The last time animated film that I saw was Ratatouille (great movie). So there has been a while since I've seen one. I'm not a big fan of animated film, but every now and then when there is one that I'm interesting in watching, I go and watch it. In this case, Kung Fu Panda. What caught my attention was the idea of a panda doing kung fu, which I though was pretty hilarious.The story is about a Panda name Po (voice by Jack Black), who is a big fan of kung fu. Sometimes, he dreams fighting bad guys with the legendary Furious Five; Tigress, Crane, Mantis, Viper, and Monkey. One day, Po's dreams comes true when he is pick to be the Dragon Warrior because the vengeful snow leopard Tai Lung (voice by Ian McShane) breaks lose from prison. Now, he is on the way to confront the dragon warrior. Meanwhile, Po trains with the Furious Five and Master Shifu to save everybody from the evil Tai Lung. There is more to the story, I won't spoil anything.From the beginning, the movie manages to keep the rhythm going until the end. The story was well told and I really liked how they explain the back story of some of the characters. What I also like about the story was that it has Chinese elements to it. It almost felt like I was watching a kung fu movie, but animated.I thought the cast of the movie were the right choices and they all did a great job. Jack Black does the voice of Po, the lazy fat panda. I thought he was hilarious through the entire movie. Justin Hoffman was great as the voice of Master Shifu. He was funny, but serious at the same time. The Furious Five were voiced by Jackie Chan (Monkey), Lucy Liu (Viper), Angelina Jolie (Tigress), Seth Rogen (Mantis), and David Cross (Crane). They all were pretty hilarious too.The action and visuals in the movie were amazing. I thought it was a very action-packed animated movie, which I haven't seen in years. I was really amazed by the animation though. It looks very real and it looked I was watching a live action movie.Kung Fu Panda is one of the best animated movies I've seen in years. It was absolutely amazing. It has a great story, cast, action, and the animation was incredible. I can't wait for the next movie.",9,0,2,1 August 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End
","The summer biggest blockbuster film has arrive. Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is an action masterpiece and the best pirate movie in the franchise so far. Director Gore Verbinski does an amazing job mixing action, comedy, drama and a little romance together. In the other hand, Hans Zimmer does a good job making the music and the new themes too. The story, acting, and visuals effects are are great. I loved the costume design, make-up and the camera work(the cinematography). The movie is pretty long, but i enjoyed every minute of it. I recommend everyone to see Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.",10,1,1,26 May 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," You Woke Up The Baby
","Hellboy is back and better than ever. I got very excited after I heard a sequel was coming out. What got me even more pump was when the teaser trailer came out. I was literally counting the days until I saw the movie. When I saw it, I couldn't stop talking about it. The film was beautifully directed and Guillermo Del Toro did an amazing job.In the original, Hellboy (Ron Perlman) was up against some pretty ugly monsters. In The Golden Army, Hellboy is up against an unstoppable army of creatures, the golden army, and a Prince name Nuada (Luke Goss). There is more to the story than this, but this the farthest I will go. I hate spoiling things.The storyline of The Golden Army is much bigger and better than the original. What makes the story so amazing is that it takes you to different awesome environments. Along with that, the creatures that Del Toro created were absolutely incredible. That's why I love Del Toro, his creativity and vision of things.After seeing the first Hellboy, I thought Ron Perlman was the perfect actor. He totally knows the Hellboy character. Selma Blair was also great as Liz Sherman. This time though, she is more involved with the team and Hellboy too. This time around, Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) gets more screen time and is also more involved with the team. Luke Goss was pretty good as Prince Nuada. I really liked the way they did the make-up. His sister, Princess Nuala, is portrayed by Anna Walton, who gave a really good performance too.The action and special effects in The Golden Army are much better than its predecessor. The fighting scenes were amazing, especially the one with the golden army. What makes the action so good is the humor with it. It makes it more enjoyable and interesting. The effects were pretty damn amazing. They look very realistic and are one of the best I've seen this year.Hellboy 2: The Golden Army is one of the best summer flicks of 08 and it is a lot of fun. Guillermo Del Toro made another great film and I can't wait when he returns to do Hellboy 3.",10,4,8,1 August 2008
Cloverfield," Blow me away
","Cloverfield was beyond my expectations. I expected it this film to be good, but not really good.The most common thing that fans didn't like is the shaky camera. The camera move quite a bit, but that really didn't bother me. If you have 'motion sickness' or whatever they call it, DON'T see the movie.What bother me was that the movie was kind of short. Other than that, it was all good.One of the best things that the movie has, is the monster. It's huge, ugly, creepy, and original. I think this monster is totally cooler than Godzilla. The offspring of the monster were cool too. The sound that they make was kind of creepy and suspenseful. *Watch out the tunnel scene*.Now, the story was very controversial. A lot of people thought the movie wasn't really a monster flick. Here is what I think. The movie is about party-goers giving a surprise party to Rob(Michael Stahl-David), who is leaving New York the next day for a vice-president job in Japan. But then, a monster comes out of nowhere and ends up screwing their party. Then the flick focus more on Rob and his friends reaching Beth(Rob's girl), who is trapped in her apartment when the monster hit. But I still thought the monster got good screen time in the movie.Overall, Cloverfield is an entertaining intense thriller that will blow you away.",9,3,7,22 January 2008
28 Weeks Later," The Rage is Back
","28 Weeks Later is gripping, intense, entertaining, scary, gory and action-packed. The way the zombies screams really creeps me out. This is the best 28 film yet in the 28 franchise. The story is great. I thought it was even better than the first one. The performance by the new cast is brilliant. I haven't seen horror film like this with so much action and guns. The opening scene of the film is scary and creepy. Juan Carlos Fresnadillo did an amazing job directing this film. There is no question that the next installment will be call 28 Months later. I recommend this flick to all horror fans and the people who saw loved the first part.",10,2,5,13 May 2007
Wanted," Crazy action+humor=amazing
","I was amazed after I saw Wanted. I was expecting Wanted to be a really good movie, but not this great. I was really blown away by what this film brought to the big screen. Sure it does have a matrix style to it, but the humor and twists made it even more interesting and enjoyable.James McAvoy is Wesley Gibson, a 25-year-old man whose life is miserable as hell. When he is working, his boss always complains regarding his work and his girlfriend cheats on him with his best friend. Gibson is basically nobody until he meets Fox (Angelina Jolie), a member of the Fraternity, a secret society that trains Gibson to develop pretty amazing and find the guy that killed his father. After joining the team, Gibson turns his life around and soon learns that the organization he is in, is not actually what it looks like.I thought the story was great and really well told. I was very surprised by the twist in the story. The movie wasn't really long, but it still manages to tell the whole story fine and clearly. I thought the director did a great job at that.The acting in the movie was great. James McAvoy was the perfect choice to play Wesley Gibson. He understood the character and did a great job. I thought Angelina Jolie did a good job as Fox. Some people thought she was bad, but I though she delivered a pretty good performance. Angelina was tough and physical, which I love about her. As for always, Morgan Freeman did a great as Sloan and he made me laugh in some parts of the movie.Besides the storyline, the action, humor, and special effects were amazing. The action scenes were incredibly entertainment and mind blowing (curving a bullet is pretty cool). The special effects were amazing. I thought the effects were very realistic. The humor is the last thing I love about Wanted. I was seriously not expecting the movie to be so hilarious.Wanted is one of the best summer movie and it delivers in every way. This is one hell of a ride and I can't wait for the sequel.",10,4,11,1 August 2008
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Better and funnier
","I was looking forward to Madagascar 2 after I heard a sequel was coming out. I thought the first one was great and one of my favorite's animated movies of all-time. When I saw Madagascar 2, I thought it was better and funnier than the first one.After being stranded in the shores of Madagascar, the New Yorkers plan an idea of repairing an old damaged plane on the island. The penguins somewhat repaired the plane thinking it's all perfect and done. Not long after taking off, the penguins notices the plane is having engines problems and tells the passengers (the New Yorkers and King Julian's people) on the air plane is going down. They land in the plains of Africa and Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria find themselves encountering their own kind and realizing this is where it all began.Most of the characters from the original return in the sequel, but the movie do have new ones as well. In the movie, Alex (Ben Stiller) meets his parents. Marty (Chris Rock), Melman (David Schwimmer) and Gloria (Jadan Pinkett Smith) meet new friends also. The Penguins are great once again and we also meet monkeys as well. They were pretty funny to say the least.I thought the movie was hilarious and funnier than Madagascar. In the first film, King Julian stole the show, but in Escape 2 Africa, I thought the old lady with glasses took that spot. I was surprised her character was brought back in the sequel. And like I said before, the penguins are awesome and I would love to see them in Antarctica in the next movie.Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a great family movie and it didn't disappoint. I thought the movie had a deeper story than the original and was definitely better too. If you enjoy Madagascar, then I think Escape 2 Africa is worth the watch. I am looking forward to Madagascar 3 on 2012.",10,2,4,16 February 2009
Tropic Thunder," Very Funny
","There was a lot of talk about Tropic Thunder before hitting theaters, especially the crazy controversy. Putting all the talk aside, I thought the movie looked hilarious from the trailers and it was even better when I saw the movie. Everybody was hysterical in the film, especially Robert Downey Jr.The story is about a group of actors, who end up in the jungles of Asia while filming a war movie. While there is more to the story than this, I thought I might not spoil anything for you. The story is simple and it is not so hard to understand when you see the whole film.Ben Stiller was great as Tugg Speedman. I thought his performance was really funny. I was a little bit surprised on how funny Jack Black was since I'm not a big fan of his movies. He plays Jeff Portnoy and also known as Fatts. Robert Downey Jr. transformation was totally insane, but hilarious at the same time. I never thought he would have been this hysterical. I think he stole the show in the movie. He certainly has a comic side that I haven't seen before. As I was watching the movie, I was trying to find out who was Tom Cruise in the movie. Then I noticed a fat guy with glasses dropping the f-bombs like crazy and there was Cruise. The dance was funny too.When I saw the movie, I was surprised on how much action the film has. I almost felt like it was an actual action flick. Now the comedy in the movie was one of the best of 2008. Everybody in the movie was hilarious and I couldn't stop laughing until the end. The movie was so funny that I couldn't even hear the dialogue at times because the entire theater was laughing like crazy.Tropic Thunder is one of the best comedies of the year. It's non-stop laugh until the end and I mean it. If you really want to laugh your heart out, I think Tropic Thunder is the right movie for you. You will not be disappointed.",9,1,5,23 December 2008
The Dark Knight," I Just Want My Phone Call
","After I saw Batman Begins, I became so obsess with movie. Batman Begins was my favorite batman movie, superhero movie and my favorite all-time. For some time, I had mix feelings about the movie when I heard The Joker was the villain. The reason was because I hated The Joker in the original batman movie. When I saw the first photo of Heath Ledger as The Joker, I then became obsess with The Dark Knight. Then I finally walked to the theater and I was blown away when I left the theater.After cleaning most of the streets in Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) is finally set to finish the job in Gotham City. With the help of Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and District Attorney Harvey Dent/Two Face (Aaron Eckhart) things look better than ever in Gotham until The Joker (Heath Ledger) sends total chaos back in Gotham. Batman is force to cross the line between hero and vigilante that leads to an ultimate showdown between The Joker and Batman.The story in The Dark Knight is so much better than Batman Begins. There are so many great themes in the movie that people and the world can relate to. Another thing I love about the story is that there is all kind of emotions in it. It was an absolutely thrill ride from the beginning to the end.The performances in the film are one of the best I've seen this year. After seeing Christian Bale in Batman Begins, I thought he was the best batman yet and he has proved it again in The Dark Knight. Bale did a great job playing Bruce Wayne's multiple personalities. Heath Ledger was absolutely astounding as The Joker. This is The Joker that I wanted to see in a long time. Ledger stole the whole movie and he is on my list for best movie villain. I won't be surprised if he doesn't get an Oscar, but he needs some kind of award for his performance. Your performance will be forever remembered. I thought Maggie Gyllenhaal was great as Rachel Dawes and better than Katie Holmes in BB. But I still think she did a good in BB, unlike others, they she was horrible. Also new in the cast is Aaron Eckhart aka Harvey Dent/Two Face. I really like his acting as Harvey Dent, Two Face was even better. I didn't expect that much from Eckhart, but he did shocked me and fans and did an amazing job.The action scenes in the movie are awesome. In my opinion, the Batpod chase scene was the best of all. I wasn't really sure about the Batpod before watching the film, but after seeing it on the big screen; I couldn't keep eyes off the damn thing. It is such a cool looking ride.The Dark Knight is the best superhero movie of the century and the darkest of the century. Heath Ledger performance was mind-blowing, terrifying, and fun as hell as The Joker. In my opinion, He is the best villain of all time. The ending really sets the tone for the whole movie and the music was so amazing. I say bring another installment even if it can't top The Dark Knight. A great story will do it for me.",10,6,12,13 October 2008
Hancock," Hancock, Bad Guys
","Hancock, Hancock, I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie. In fact, I wasn't even planning to see the movie, but the mall was so boring that I decided to the flick anyways. When I saw the trailer, I thought it looked like a fun summer movie. There was nothing really amazing or intriguing about the movie.Hancock is a superhero, but a very different one. He is always drinking and the public hates him so much. When bad guys are on the loose or people's life is in danger, he gets the job done, but not without leaving a big mess behind. The thing is that Hancock doesn't care what people think about him, the public had have enough of this guy rude behavior. His life suddenly changes when one day he saves the life of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a PR executive. With the help of Embrey, Hancock starts realizing he may have a side he hasn't seen and the side that the public really need.At first, things going smooth in the story, but then there is a twist in the movie that I thought the director could off done better. I thought it took a while to fully explain everything in the movie. I was getting a little confused when they were trying to pick up after the twist, but I understood everything at the end.I really liked Will Smith as Hancock. I loved the character and Will Smith did a great job. It wasn't his best performance, but a great one. Jason Bateman was a good choice to play Ray Embrey. I think he did a fine job acting. There were some scenes that he was trying to be humorous, but it didn't worked that well. And there was Charlize Theron, which I thought was great as Mary Embrey.Hancock has good action scenes and good enough special effects. The movie wasn't really action packed; it was just an average action movie. The special effects were believable, but not realistic. To me, they didn't look as really as other blockbuster films. But that doesn't mean I didn't liked them, I'm so saying they could off been better.Hancock was a good superhero movie. The only problem that I had was the twist. If it wasn't for that, I would off give the movie a better rating. The movie has good humor, action, and special effects. It wasn't the best superhero film, but a good popcorn summer flick.",8,1,2,9 October 2008
Iron Man," One of the best comic movies ever made
","Last summer season, fans and critics were disappointed by what Spider-Man 3 brought to the big screen. This year, the highly anticipated comic book blockbuster movie Iron Man blew fans and even critics away. According to the critics, Iron Man is considered one of the best comic book movies of all-time and possibly the best of all-time. I totally agree with them and this is what comic book films should be like. Fun and entertaining! Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark) is a billionaire, genius inventor and a playboy man who is kidnapped and forced to build a missile by some crazy terrorists. Instead of building the missile, Stark uses his creative and genius mind and builds a high-tech suit of armor. He battles the people that kidnapped and escapes from the nightmare. When things get out of hand at his weapon manufacturing company, Stark thinks there are better things to do than just weapons, become the Iron Man.I thought the storyline was great and well develop. It flew well and is not a complicated story to understand. What I like about the plot is that there are major reasons why Stark wanted to be Iron Man. I'm not going to say any reason because I don't want to spoil it for you.By far, the best thing in Iron Man was the brilliant performance by Downey Jr. The way he acted brought great things to the film. Downey Jr. was born to play this role and he absolutely masters it. The supporting cast did a great job also. Gwyneth Paltrow was a good choice to play Virginia 'Pepper' Potts. She was natural and delivered a pretty good performance. Jeff Bridges did a nice job also. He played a good villain, not the greatest one, but a good one. And finally, Terrence Howard as Jim Rhodes or Rhodey or whatever you want to call it. I can't wait to see him as War Machine.The visual effects in the movie are amazing and very realistic. The CGI work was also great. I really like the shine in Iron Man. It looks real and that's what you are looking for when it comes to f/x and CGI. The action and humor in the film is incredible. Especially the humor! You'll probably laugh through most of the flick.Iron Man kicked off the 2008 summer season with great entertainment and it delivers in every possible way. The film, in my opinion is way better than the Spider-Man and X-Men movies. Even though I'm a fan of both trilogies, Iron Man is those movies that you want to see it a million times. If you anything to do at your house, I suggest you spent two hours at the movies and see Iron Man.",10,1,3,18 May 2008
Pineapple Express," Awesome
","At first, I wasn't really paying any attention to the movie. After watching the trailer, I was definitely going to watch this movie. Seth Rogen is a great comedian actor, but I didn't know anything about James Franco's comic side. After watching the movie, he was funny as hell. His fake hair was so realistic. I thought it was his real though, but obviously it wasn't. Whoever did the hair did a great job.Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) is a lazy court clerk and a drug user. Every time he needs weed, he goes to his best friend Saul Silver (James Franco) to buy some, specially, one called Pineapple Express. One day, while in his car smoking weed (the pineapple express), Dale witness a murder buy a dirty cop and the city's drug lord. Dale panics and throws the weed out of the window and takes off in his car. He rushes to tell Saul what he saw and they both start running for their lives. Now, the dirty cop wants to kill the witness and sends his trio of bad guys to kill Dale and Saul also.I thought the story was great and well told. I really like how everything was brought to the end of the film without any confusion. I enjoy the script from the beginning until the end.Seth Rogen was the right choice for Dale Denton. I thought he was great and delivered a great hilarious performance. But I thought James Franco was amazing as Saul Silver. He really look like a big time drug addict. Every time he was on a scene, I laughed. He is one of the funniest character in the movie.I really like how the action was mix up with the humor. It wasn't force at all like other comedies. It was perfectly done. I laughed throw the entire movie. There wasn't a minute where I couldn't stop laughing. I thought the action was good though. I was not expecting that much gun firing in the movie.Pineapple Express is one of the funniest movie this year. Seth Rogen and James Franco were hilarious in the movie, especially Franco. If you are a comedy movie fan, then I believe this movie will leave wanting even more.",9,0,2,19 November 2008
