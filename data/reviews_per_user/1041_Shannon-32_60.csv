The Sound of Music," Great film for all ages!
","I'm a college student and I just love this film.  Great acting by Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and by the children portraying Baron Von Trapp's brood of seven.  The songs are fun and catchy!
Like the main post on this site says, you should NOT be without a copy of this classic.  I will eventually get a copy once I obtain a DVD player.  No sex, vulgarity, or violence make this movie a great film, filled with Christian values.  Run, don't walk, to your nearest Blockbuster and either rent or purchase this film.",Null,0,5,30 June 2002
50 First Dates," Hmmm....
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis film is offensive in every sense of the word.  Profanity, references to sex and drugs, and sexual relations outside of marriage make this movie not worth watching in my opinion.  I'm surprised that this actually was a PG-13, considering some of the profanity in the film.Adam Sandler never fails to entertain me and he is the only good thing about the film along with Sean Astin's character as the body-building Doug Whitmore.  I'm glad I rented this on DVD because I certainly do not think that this is worth the $6.75 to see in theaters.  2.75 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,2,28 June 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Interesting movie
","This was my first film with Leonardo DiCaprio since 'Titanic.'  He gives a much better performance as a teen-age fraud on the lam than a lovesick, romantic artist on a sinking ship.  Plus, the film is based on a true story so I give it two thumbs up.  The film also portrays the consequences of bank fraud and such.  In fact, I didn't know there was such thing as 'bank fraud' back in the 60's.  This is a great movie to see after all the winter blockbusters.  I doubt this film will be taking home any Oscars but it's good enough to merit attention.",Null,0,1,9 January 2003
Spartacus," Great fun!
","**Possible spoilers ahead**Awesome movie that must be viewed by every film buff!  Kirk Douglas, Jean Simmons, Peter Ustinov, and Laurence Olivier are just fantastic in Stanley Kubrick's classic!  Douglas is great as the slave Spartacus, who fights his way through the system of slavery in ancient Rome.  Simmons is just lovely as Spartacus' wife.  Olivier's performance as Crassus steals the show as well as his semi-right hand man Peter Ustinov.  If anyone has seen Gladiator, you must see this film!  As the first film I've seen that's directed by Kubrick, this film gets 4 out of 4 stars :)",Null,0,1,22 May 2002
Casablanca," 'Louie, this looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.'
",This movie is a classic and should be REGARDED as one.  Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are just wonderful as the lovers torn from each other. Anyone that hasn't seen this hasn't really lived yet.,8,1,3,13 July 1999
Meet the Parents," The second movie is better.
","Yes, I'm one of those weirdos who saw the second movie first and then rented the first movie afterward. This film isn't as funny as its' successor but it's cleaner. However, my only complaint is that Owen Wilson overplays his character, Kevin. The character of Kevin himself is quite unrealistic.Still, that doesn't mean the movie is bad. It's quite good actually. It's just that 'Meet the Fockers' is a lot funnier than this one. Robert DeNiro is fitting as his role as Jack Byrnes, Greg's future (psycho) father-in-law.And it's also worth the rental price, too.",7,0,2,9 January 2005
The Birth of a Nation," Racist? You bet. A landmark in film history? Definitely.
","I had to view this film for my Civil War history class at a local university.  Being from a modern biased standpoint, this film was so racist that I wanted to puke.  The ending of the film was worse (I am not going to reveal that to you.  You need to see the film for yourself.), however, this film should be viewed from an educational context.  This movie is a landmark in film history and I consider it revolutionary for its time. 
Film students, film historians (or any historian for that matter), film buffs, and history students need to see this film not for entertainment purposes (what's so entertaining about racism anyway) but to examine the content of the film.  Why did people think that way?  How did the  first Reconstruction of the United States fail?  How did the North and South view each other before, during, and after the Civil War?  The answer to these questions and many more can be found in D.W. Griffith's film, 'A Birth of a Nation.'",Null,3,7,28 December 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," ARRRGGGGGHHHH MATEY! This be a jolly good film, arrrgghh!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSI saw this in the theaters last summer and man, this is classic, edge-of-your seat fun!  Sexy Orlando Bloom's presence in the film is worth the $6.50 admission alone!As a fan of the classic Disneyland ride, I decided to see the film and while I'm familiar with the book-to-movie genre of film, I'm not exactly knowledgable of the theme-park-ride-to-film genre.  Still, this movie kicks butt.  Big time.Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp are both eye-candy for the female viewing audience (being a female, I found them to be quite eye-candyish). Geoffrey Rush steals the show as the power hungry pirate out for revenge.
9/10...YO HO, YO HO, a pirate's life for meeeeee......",Null,0,0,16 April 2004
Elizabeth," Quite interesting.
","I'm glad I saw this film on DVD; I don't think it would be worth $6 to see it in the theater but nonetheless, it's a good film and any history buff should include it in his or her DVD collection.  Cate Blanchett shines as Elizabeth (she plays Galadriel in the 'Lord of the Rings' series).  Some of the sexual content in the film made my stomach do some flip flops so I just covered my eyes (I was watching this in a class on early Modern European history...and I absolutely hate sex scenes).  Another two thumbs up go to Geoffrey Rush as Sir Walsingham.  My suggestion would be to see this film and read along with Susan Bridgen's 'New Worlds, Old Worlds.'  Joseph Fiennes is also good as Elizabeth's (married) lover, Sir Robert Dudley.",Null,0,0,15 March 2004
Spider-Man 2," SPIDEY'S BACK!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSYep, Spidey's back in the sequel, 'Spider-Man 2.'  And this time, Spidey/Peter Parker goes through some post-teenage angst (i.e. romance, juggling school/work/family life, etc.).  This is what a sequel is supposed to be like.  Better than the original....and it has outshone the original in more ways than one.  It has more action, more suspense, and moral lessons to go along with it.  Like the Lord of the Rings series, this movie is much, much better than its predecessor.  Tobey Maguire is excellent reprising his role as Spider-Man and Kirsten Dunst is equally entertaining as Mary Jane a.k.a 'M.J.'  James Franco is a very good-looking dude (so is Maguire) and plays a rather egotistical and down-and-out corporate C.E.O Harry Osborn (very convincingly, I might add). It was weird to see Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, but nonetheless, he did a great job.4.5 out of 5 stars",Null,0,0,9 July 2004
Finding Nemo," Cute, funny, and really cool!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSPixar has never ceased to amaze me.  I saw the film last summer in theaters and I just about cracked up at all those 'obscure' pop-culture references, sarcastic humor, etc.  It's a great film not just for kids, but for all ages.  It may not be a good movie to take your date to, but more of a fun movie to take the kids, a friend, spouse, or just yourself for some lighthearted humor.  Run, don't walk, to the nearest video rental store and get this movie.  You will NOT be disappointed.Kudos to Ellen Degeneres and Albert Brooks for their voice talents as the two exotic fish in the movie.  The seagulls steal the show as they keep repeating their only line in the film:  'Mine, mine, mine....'",Null,0,2,17 April 2004
Alexander," Holy schmoly!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis is the first film I have ever seen by Oliver Stone (yeah, I guess I live in a cave somewhere, huh). It is better than the overrated summer blockbuster, 'Troy.'But it is quite disturbing for me. The gore, blood, bisexual overtones, etc. just about turned my stomach so much that it was doing somersaults. This is not a film for the weak of stomach or faint of heart. Colin Ferrell deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Enough said.Angelina Jolie is BADLY miscast as Olympias, Alexander's mom. She should have been the one playing Roxane instead of Rosario Dawson. Someone like Glenn Close or Julie Andrews should've had the role as Olympias. The film is good but it does have a lot of nasty stuff in it.",Null,0,1,27 November 2004
Troy," The Bradiator
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS'Troy' is nothing like 'Gladiator.'  It is basically a Brad Pitt skinfest. The film should be renamed 'The Bradiator.'  Brad Pitt's character, Achilles, wasn't likeable in the least as opposed to Russell Crowe's Maximus.  The only actor in the film worthy of mention is Eric Bana as Hector.  Brad Pitt is handsome but definitely overrated.  Russell Crowe is far more good-looking than the Bradster.The sex in the film could have been eliminated and the film would've been better.  Still, 'Gladiator' is a much better choice than Wolfgang Petersen's 'Troy.'  3 out of 5 stars",Null,11,22,8 June 2004
A Bridge Too Far," Great war movie!
","Possible spoilersThis film illustrates to what may be the seemingly unknown event in World War Two history.  'A Bridge Too Far' is about the details of the Allied blunder during WW2 called Operation Market Garden.  Great performances by Dirk Bogarde, Sean Connery, Robert Redford, Laurence Olivier, etc. etc. 
My only complaint was that the film was too long, but the scenery and the historical worth make up for it.  I'm surprised that my professor in one of the history classes I take never brought up Operation Market Garden. Apparently, it was unimportant to the curriculum, I guess.I recommend this to anyone who's a scholar of history, a college history major (like myself), or a history buff that likes learning about the second world war.  Rent this film.  You will not be disappointed.",Null,2,3,1 May 2004
The Polar Express," Cute holiday fluff
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSAlthough I haven't read the book yet, I will after watching the film. 'The Polar Express' is a film strictly for kids but it does appeal to the grown-up crowd as well. I liked this film because it reminded me of my childhood when I used to believe in Santa Claus. It also has a hidden meaning and it doesn't necessarily have to apply to belief in Santa per se. We, not just kids but adults too, should believe in ourselves and in our friends/family/God, etc. I recommend this film to all ages. This will be one of those Christmas film legends along with 'It's a Wonderful Life.'",Null,1,2,27 November 2004
Elf," Instant Christmas classic! Just add water.
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis is destined to become another Christmas favorite along with the new film, 'The Polar Express' and the timeless classic, 'It's a Wonderful Life.'Will Ferrell is a riot as Buddy, a North Pole 'elf' who goes to the real world to discover his true self. His naivete, cluelessness, and innocence clash with the reality of the nature of New York City. James Caan is a natural as Buddy's real dad who's a Scrooge-like individual working for a publishing company. Buddy has managed to warm the hearts of Jovie, a mall employee working as an 'elf,' his half-brother, and his dad's wife. It teaches us all about the spirit of Christmas (but not the real meaning behind it, though).",Null,0,2,27 November 2004
Romeo + Juliet," A major disappointment
","I thought I was going to enjoy this film when I rented it and I realized that I had wasted my $3 in renting this flick.I did not see Romeo and Juliet at all in the film.  I only saw Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes.Instead of original costumes, everyone's wearing Hawaiian T-shirts and stuff we wear everyday.The Prince, who is portrayed as a police officer, dismissed a public brawl between the Montagues and the Capulets (beginning scene).  If he was a real police officer, arrests would've been made.Claire Danes' portrayal of Juliet was mediocre.  She didn't have enough feeling, especially in the balcony scene.If you want to see a REAL performance of 'Romeo and Juliet,' rent the 1968 version directed by Franco Zefferelli and narrated by Sir Laurence Olivier.",Null,4,8,14 July 1999
"Monsters, Inc."," Great fun for all ages!
","** POSSIBLE SPOILERS **What can I say?  It's funny, cute, and good clean fun!  Disney and Pixar never cease to amaze me.  They make films that both adults (such as myself) and kids can enjoy.  Hopefully, Pixar/Disney will be making films long enough for my own children to enjoy.  Monsters Inc. is a cute story that revolves around two monsters, Sulley and Mike, and a child that accidentally gets loose in the Monsters Inc. scare factory.  Of course, the idea behind this film is to explore more into the 'monsters-in-the-closet' theory we all had as kids.Like Toy Story and Toy Story 2, I enjoyed this film.",Null,0,1,31 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Peter Jackson's masterpiece!!!!1
","I saw this on the big screen in September of 2002 and I was just amazed at the visual effects, acting, and so forth.  This movie just blows 'Harry Potter' right out of the water.  It stays about 85% true to Tolkien's classic book series.  I am greatly anticipating the next film in the series and I hope it will pick up a Best Picture Oscar next year.Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, and everyone else were EXCELLENT, if not stunning in their roles as Gandalf, Frodo, and Strider. 
Out of four stars, I'd give it five :)",Null,0,0,27 June 2002
The Village," Great film!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSAfter seeing 'Signs' back in 2002, I was a little disappointed with M. Night Shyamalan but I was really curious to see 'The Village.'I took a friend of mine and we went out to dinner and saw the film. At first, my friend said that the critics said that it wasn't very good (apparently, he wanted to see 'The Hero' instead...LOL).My friend and I saw the movie and we both liked it. But I kept scratching my head at a few parts during the movie which I won't include because I don't want to spoil it for everyone. The reason why I liked it is because it's a bit of a Biblical allusion; about humankind and sin. It's a great movie for Christians and non-Christians alike to illustrate the foundation of the Christian faith without being preachy.",Null,0,0,19 September 2004
"I, Robot"," Now THIS is a movie
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis is how a movie is SUPPOSED to be made.  It's also one of the few movies that was worth the $6.75 I paid to see it.  Right along with Spiderman 2, 'I, Robot' is a fast-paced thrill ride featuring Will Smith who kicks robot butt.This is much better than T3 (sorry Ahhnold) and with plenty of action to keep one on the edge of one's seat.  My only problem is the blatant product placement for Converse and JVD electronics.....but hey, what movie doesn't have product placement?4 out of 5 stars",Null,0,0,22 July 2004
The Alamo," This movie kicks butt!
","After seeing this film, I was just...well....stunned.  This movie has 'Oscar' written all over it.  The battle scenes were awesome (not exactly 'Lord of the Rings' material, but still awesome).  There was little sex or nudity and the vulgarity was few and far between.  This is a great film about an important but overlooked era in American history.  This film has made me anxious to go out and rent the John Wayne version made in 1960...and I will, too.  Billy Bob Thorton was excellent as Davy Crockett and Dennis Quaid was just as good as Sam Houston.  Jason Patric is fabulous as the knife-wielding Jim Bowie.  Do not miss this film, it's worth the $7 to see it.  Take my advice and GO SEE THIS FILM!",Null,2,4,11 April 2004
The Battle of Algiers," Hmmmm...
","This is a rather thought-provoking film from the guy who brought us the movie, 'Quemada!' It is the mid 1950s where Algerians are fighting against French occupation and colonialism (the French had been in Algiers for 130 yrs.). A young, ambitious man named Ali volunteers his services with a terrorist organization to combat the French.The shooting of French police and innocent Algerian and French people motivate the government of France to send in military aid to ward off the terrorist activity. Only until 1962 did Algeria gain its' independence.What bugs me about this film is that the F.L.N. rule over Algeria was no different than the French occupation. People were still in the same situation they were before their 'independence.' However, the film director is a devout Marxist, which explains why the terrorists were portrayed as heroes.",7,2,10,18 January 2005
Van Helsing," WOW!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSI walked out of this film amazed.  This is pure genius.  All the special effects, hunky Hugh Jackman....everything is worth the $6.50 I paid to see it.What I do not like about the film is Kate Beckinsdale's gothic-esque bodice that she wore during the entire film.  That could've been scrapped...it looks disgusting.Another good thing about the film is that there are no sex scenes in it. While there are a few sexual references and some sensuality in the film, there isn't anyone doing the actual deed, which is a good thing since sex scenes make me very uncomfortable.The guy playing Dracula looks a lot like Alan Cumming, however, he isn't Alan Cumming.  Just my thoughts.3.5 out of 5 stars",Null,0,0,9 May 2004
Spider-Man," Great action flick!
","I was skeptical about this film.  Heck, I'm not even an action film buff and I didn't really want to see this, but since my parents rented it, I took the liberty of watching it (since it was due back in two days...didn't want it to go to waste).  I honestly thought I'd be bored stiff. 
Well, this film isn't boring.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you stay there until the end of the film.  Tobey Maguire is awesome as Spider-Man/Peter Parker.  Willem Defoe makes a delicious villain as the Green Goblin.  I advise anyone to go and rent this great film.  It's not Oscar material exactly, but it's a blockbuster that needs to be seen.  Women, such as myself, will swoon over Peter Parker.  Men will swoon over Mary Jane, and kids will cheer for the hero of the film, that is Spider-Man.  So technically, there's something for everyone in this movie.",Null,0,0,3 January 2003
Collateral," Creepy...just creepy
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSI walked out of the theater feeling freaked out. The film was good as far as being well made and such but I did not like the premise of the film, especially the dark character played by Tom Cruise.This film is like Grand Theft Auto on the big screen. A hired hit-man 'carjacks' a taxi cab to go on his stops to murder innocent people.Films like this should not be made...ever. I wish I never saw this movie and I wish I walked out and demanded my money back. I guess I was used to watching Tom Cruise as Lt. Algren in The Last Samurai. Of course Tom Cruise looked really good in the film, as far as looks go.Still, I will not recommend this film to anyone. It's just disgusting.",Null,0,0,19 September 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Good but not amazing
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe film is a little darker than the first two but it wasn't as scarier (not that I enjoy watching scary movies).  Alfonso Cuaron's directorial touch to the film made it less enjoyable than the previous two movies.  I guess I'm used to Chris Columbus' work.  It was also strange not seeing Richard Harris as Professor Dumbledore.  A note to parents:  I would not take kids under the age of 10 to see the movie.  Also, there was some mild cussing among the kids at Hogwarts (i.e. 'bloody h***') that I found objectionable.  And it's not exactly a spiritually redeeming film, but good special effects nonetheless.3 out of 5 stars",Null,0,0,8 June 2004
Gone with the Wind," Wonderful and compelling drama!
","I was 15 when I rented this movie a couple of years ago after reading the book.  I loved every minute of it.  Now I own the soundtrack and the digitally-remastered video version of this timeless classic (of course the book is ALWAYS better).Vivien Leigh received a well-deserved Oscar for her performance as the spoiled and bratty Southern belle.  Other kudos go to Clark Gable as the handsome and rough Rhett Butler, Olivia DeHavilland as the sweet and kind-hearted Melanie Hamilton, Leslie Howard as the kind-hearted Ashley Wilkes, and Hattie McDaniel as the motherly Mammy.If you have never seen this movie, then you need to run, not walk, to the nearest Blockbuster and rent it (or buy it).  Before you do, check out the book too.  It's a wonderful masterpiece.",Null,1,1,13 July 1999
Meet the Fockers," WOW...this is funny!
","Although I find the idea of premarital sex or any kind of sexual content in a film disgusting, this film was a riot! My mother dragged me to see this movie and I was kinda looking forward to it (I really wanted to see The Aviator so I can get it overwith).To me, this was like watching 'There's Something About Mary.' It was that funny. However, I'm surprised it got a PG-13 rating. The sexual references and content would probably merit an R. It's pretty much a PG-13 rated version of 'There's Something About Mary.' My advice is to see it without the teen-agers since the sexual overtones are not appropriate for them at their age.",8,1,5,29 December 2004
Zulu," Brilliant piece of work
","One of Michael Caine's first films is one of the best I've seen of his work so far. 'Zulu' is the rendition of how a British army garrison defended their fort against Zulu African warriors. Better than Gillo Pontecorvo's 'The Battle of Algiers' and Jean-Jacques Annaud's 'Black and White in Color,' the film gives a realistic view of battle without the 'bad white man' stereotypes.This movie should be seen by history buffs, historians, college students, film students, and anyone with an interest in British/African history. It's a great piece of work. It's not totally historically accurate but it's a good watch. Rent this or if you're lucky, catch it on TCM or AMC someday.",9,3,4,6 February 2005
The Pianist," WOW!
",This film was breathtaking and realistic.  It was also interesting to know that this was a true story about a Polish Jew who plays the piano over the radio who finds himself having to run from the Nazis to survive.Adrien Brody was excellent in his role as the talented man forced to flee and live off of family friends to stay alive.  This film is also the first film I have seen by Roman Polanski.  The movie deserves an Oscar for best adapted screenplay.  I believe that this film will give 'Two Towers' a run for its money (even though I liked 'Two Towers' better than this one).,Null,0,0,14 January 2003
Seabiscuit," Oh yeah...this movie rocks!
","** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD **I had the opportunity to see this on the big screen.  This is an awesome film with awesome actors.  For some reason, I believe that Jeff Bridges and Tobey Maguire were both robbed of Oscar nominations this year because of their note-worthy performances in this movie.  The movie is good.  There's some profanity, a few sexual implications, and some violence but it does have a good moral to the story.  Never give up and never let size get in the way of what you want to do in life.  Seabiscuit was small for the size of a racehorse and Red Pollard (the jockey, played by Tobey Maguire) was said to be too big.  Well, apparently, size didn't matter to them as they managed to capture several racetrack victories, both in the film and in real life.

The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Why in the world didn't MST3K get a hold of this sooner?
","I am ashamed to say that this movie was filmed and associated with my hometown of San Diego, CA.  This movie was NOTHING like Michael Criton's bestseller.  It doesn't even come close.  The movie and the book it is supposedly based on seem like two different stories.  If you want a better movie version of Michael Criton's story, rent either the first film or the third film.  I wished I was sitting next to the guys from MST3K when I was watching this.",Null,1,2,30 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Peter Jackson has done it again! Great film!
","** POSSIBLE SPOILERS **I had seen this film today and I am just mesmorized.  Unlike its predecessor, this film is a little slow in the beginning, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I have never been more 'on the edge of my seat' than this film.  This time, the Fellowship is broken up.  Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn have gone to defend a kingdom from a huge army of orcs.  Merry and Pippin are kidnapped by Orcs only to be rescued by a race of talking trees.  Frodo and Sam are on their way to Mordor with the help of an almost hairless and almost naked (except for an itty-bitty loincloth) creature by the name of Gollum.The action will keep you on the edge of your seat and I am not revealing the ending.

The Incredibles," Great but not 'incredible'
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSI came into the theater expecting this film to be something like 'Monsters, Inc.' or 'Finding Nemo.' It was exactly like those films but it wasn't any better. Still, it's good film fare and I don't regret going to see the movie. It's good enough to get the kiddies interested and it still has the appeal to grown-ups also. I also smell a possible sequel to the movie, too (think 'Toy Story' and 'Toy Story 2') which I hope would be a little better than this one. Shrek 2 is better than this film.'The Incredibles' is not a bad movie; quite far from being a bad movie. It just didn't have that spark like 'Finding Nemo' did.",Null,0,1,27 November 2004
Patton," Excellent portrayal of a true, American hero!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis is my new favorite war film. General George S. Patton is now one of my most admired individuals in history. Alexander the Great, Napoleon Bonaparte, and George Washington cannot match up to how well this guy led his army.With Patton's use of profanity aside, this is a good film about the realities and the pressures of war and a good history lesson for all. I'd recommend this to history buffs, college history majors (like myself), historians, and history professors alike. You cannot mention WWII (or the Battle of the Bulge, for that matter) without mentioning General Patton. He is in a class by himself. The late George C. Scott played Patton so wonderfully that his role fit him like a glove. You just got to see this movie...it's fantastic!",Null,2,7,19 September 2004
La Grande Illusion," Great film!
","This is one of the better foreign films I have seen lately. 'Grand Illusion' is a movie that should be considered a timeless, cinematic classic. It goes into the human condition, assessing the theme of friendship as well as the theme of the realities of war. I'm surprised I can't find a classic like this at a video rental place such as Blockbuster.I really hate to say this but 'Grand Illusion' is better than Luis Bunuel's 'L'Age 'D'Or.' I was fortunate to have seen 'Grand Illusion' on a public access channel and was surprised to find out how popular it was in the foreign film world. I'd watch this again; it's a great film.",8,1,2,16 January 2005
Men in Black II," Great but not as good as its predecessor

Chevy Chase, Ted Knight, Bill Murray, and Rodney Dangerfield are just hilarious.And you gotta love that gopher.Bill Murray steals the show as Carl, the groundskeeper who wages World War III on a gopher who is causing damage to a golf course.  The DVD could've had more features but nonetheless, the behind-the-scenes movie on it was interesting.Ted Knight is also good in his role as an egotistical judge out for some time to go golfing and cause trouble with another character (Rodney Dangerfield).I give this film 7/10",Null,0,1,23 April 2004

Big Fish," Whimsical fun!

To make up for proverbial stinkers 'Beetlejuice' and 'Mars Attacks,' Tim Burton gives us 'Big Fish,' the story of a son coming to terms with his father's identity after hearing his dad tell him tall tales about his life.Each story seems like a Biblical allusion: where young Ed Bloom works three years just to find out about his future wife, Sandra. It reminds me of when Jacob had to work 14 years just to marry the love of his life, Rebekah. It's a fantastic journey into the human imagination and I recommend it to everyone who doesn't mind a little fantasy every now and then.",9,1,1,19 January 2005

He travels to Japan to train the imperial army but ends up getting captured by Samurais...and begins a new life.This is a great film.  However, it is not spiritually redeeming since it does not include Biblical morals and the violence is in excess ('Lord of the Rings' violence but more of it).  This film certainly gave ROTK a run for its money during the Oscars but I doubt this was good enough to win for best picture.  3.75 out of 5 stars",Null,1,2,30 May 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Good, but Lord of the Rings is so much better!
","I saw this before I saw Lord of the Rings.  I thought this movie was impressive until I saw LoTR.  Now, I think it's pretty good but not that great.  As a Christian, some of the stuff in the movie was kind of dark but still good storyline of good overcoming evil.  It pretty much stays true to the book it's based on.  The way the Dursleys were depicted was as I imagined them to be depicted.  Good movie and it gets 3 out of 4 stars.",Null,0,0,27 June 2002
It's a Wonderful Life," A wonderful film!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis is what I call classic Capra and classic Stewart.  This is a great film to watch with your family during Christmas time.  It makes you think about the things we take for granted everyday and for those who don't have it so good.  This film shows how God works in strange and mysterious ways.  This film should be in every Christian's video/DVD library.My favorite character besides George Bailey is Charlie, George's guardian angel.  He truly does steal the show as George's voice of reason and logic. 'It's a Wonderful Life' is a timeless classic that should be seen by all.",9,1,5,4 June 2004
A Beautiful Mind," A great film!
","** POSSIBLE SPOILERS **Although I believe that 'Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring' deserved the Oscar for best picture, this film is really interesting and unique.  Here we have a young genius, John Nash, who is plagued by a mental disorder and puts his wife through some serious hell as well as his friends and colleagues ends up winning a Nobel prize in 1994 several years after his psychiatrist tells him that he would never be able to think logically again.The film teaches us that we can overcome mental illness with perseverance, determination, and a little bit of faith.  God bless John Nash!",Null,0,2,9 January 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," WOW!
","This movie rocked.  It was your classic, edge-of-your seat excitement with Harry, Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, and a scene-stealing flying car.  True to the book, this movie gives the vivid details of the dreaded Chamber of Secrets and the story of Moaning Myrtle, the ghost who lives in the girls' bathroom. It also has its share of hilarity as Ron's owl flies into a bowl of chips while delivering a stern message to Ron from his mother.  As a Christian, I also had to examine the morality of the film.  This movie IS NOT and I repeat, IS NOT for children under the age of 10.  The woman sitting next to us had to escort her screaming daughter out of the theater (I estimate she was about 5 or 6 years of age).  There are too many jump scenes that can makes this scary for the younger set.  The violence in this film is on the borderline of PG and PG-13.  There really isn't any 'witchcraft' in the film.  All it is is fantasy, just like C.S. Lewis' 'Chronicles of Narnia' and J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings' but if it still bothers you, then don't see the film.",Null,0,0,29 November 2002
Ice Age," Very cool!
","I loved watching this film.  It was funny, witty, but some jokes are kind of forced in some parts.  The annoying Syd, the semi-bad guy Diego, and the sarcastic but witty Manfred are classic!  The short with the prehistoric squirrel was kind of cute as he finds a safe, nesting ground for his acorn.This film is recommended to people of all ages since both kids and grown-ups are able to enjoy it.",Null,0,0,3 January 2003
To Kill a Mockingbird," A compelling drama that's not to be missed!
","I love this movie.  Gregory Peck definitely deserved that acting Oscar.  The acting was excellent, the direction was flawless, with the exception of Boo Radley, which the movie didn't show the real relationship between him and the kids like it did in the book (read the book first, it's always better than the movie).Nonetheless, this movie is to be regarded as a classic.  I've watched it a few times and this flick never ceases to amaze me.  It should be shown in every junior high and high school classroom as an example of society in the Depression-era South.",10,3,9,26 September 1999
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Hmmmm....
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe film was funny and Will Ferrell, as always, steals the show.  However, I was appalled at the use of the F-word in the film as well as several sexual references.  The film rarely captures the beauty of San Diego.  Being a native of San Diego, I only saw the movie because my town was featured in it.  However, more of San Diego needed to be shown in the film.  I hope this film will allow more filmmakers to come here and make more movies. 
The scene with Jack Black kicking an innocent dog off the Coronado Bridge was unnecessary.2.75 out of 5 stars",Null,1,2,18 July 2004
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," A true masterpiece!
","This must be regarded as Walt Disney's best!I love this film and it is one of my favorite Disney movies.  The characters are unforgettable and the songs stick in your  head (hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work we go...).I love the voice talents, especially the one for the evil queen and Snow White.  Grumpy steals the show as the moody dwarf as well as Dopey, the silent but funny dwarf.I recommend this movie to not just kids, but to EVERYONE.",Null,3,4,25 September 1999
The Terminal," Great film!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSThis is a wonderful film about friendships, relationships, and everything in between.  Tom Hanks plays (rather convincingly) Viktor Naborski, a man from a made-up country who comes to the United States for a special reason. While flying to New York, a coup was launched in his country and now he's stuck in the international terminal in the J.F.K airport with no country and no way out until the problems in his country clear up. 
He eventually meets some friends along the way, including a security agent, a janitor, a couple of INS officers, and a gofer in love with one of his fellow employees.  The film is 85% squeaky clean and good fun.  I was so disappointed at one of the sub-plots at the end of the film (the relationship between Ameila and Viktor).  I walked out of the film with a smile on my face and it was the first time in a month that a movie has provoked me to do so. 
4 out of 5 stars",Null,0,1,25 June 2004
Bruce Almighty," It has its ups and downs but it's still the classic Jim Carrey schtick
","** POSSIBLE SPOILERS **The good parts of the film are the message.  We, as humans, can never try to make the world revolve around us nor can we understand how God works the way He does.  We can never go on life on our own and we must rely on (or humble ourselves to) a higher power, particularly God, however, God is portrayed negatively in this film as one of those 'playful Gods' who like to pick on people.  There is little or no emphasis on Christ and Redemption.  Bruce Nolan (Carrey) and his girlfriend, Grace, are shacked up together in sin and yet, God chooses to 'bless' them.  Bruce uses a couple of ungodly vocabulary, including the f-word.  Still, Grace continues to pray for Bruce's well-being and Bruce manages to sum up a good prayer.  Jim Carrey is still funny, with his unique comedic style, complete with stupid-funny antics.  I give this ** out of **** stars.",Null,0,1,24 May 2003
Signs," Okay but overrated...
","** Possible spoilers **
As a Christian, I was looking at a Christian movie review website and it said that this film was pro-faith, about a minister (Gibson), struggling with his faith in God, along with finding crop circles in his cornfield.It seems that Mr. Shyamalan tried to squeeze in two plots at once.  Now, I don't know what the film really is about.  Is it about Gibson's character who struggles with his Christian faith or is it about a bunch of aliens cutting crop circles all over the world?  The ending was just too sudden and brief. It should have been expanded, like maybe, a shot of Gibson's character addressing his congregation or something like that.  The trailer of the film looked awesome and from the trailer, I expected some heart-racing jump scenes but those were few and far between.From the six bucks I paid to see this film, it's worth about three bucks. My advice is to wait until it comes out on video.",Null,1,1,7 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Absolutely breathtaking!
","I cannot describe how wonderful this movie was.  The battle scenes, the jump scenes, and the cinementography are just awesome.  I have a hunch that this will be 'the film' to sweep the Academy Awards.  Orlando Bloom as Legolas Greenleaf, Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins, and Ian McKellen as Gandalf are stellar and I hope that one of them (or maybe Viggo Mortensen as Aragon) is nominated for an Academy Award.  This film is so much better than the previous movies.  It's not that the two previous films are bad; both of them are excellent and deserving of the awards they have won, it's just that the final film is far more outstanding (and it seems that way with most trilogies).  It's worth the money, trust me.",Null,0,0,11 January 2004
Ran," Now this is cool!
","** POSSIBLE SPOILERS **This happens to be my second Akira Kurosawa film.  Unlike the one I viewed before it ('Seven Samurai'), 'Ran' takes a look at the conflicts of Japanese aristocracy.  Since it is based on William Shakespeare's 'King Lear,' I had to see this, (I also had to see it for my Asian history class) being a fan of Shakespeare.The plot involves a warlord dividing up his land among his three sons, two of them are greedy and fake while the youngest remains faithful and loyal to his dad.  Nonetheless, the loyal son gets banished and the other two sons wreck havoc on their lives as well as the lives of their allies and family members.  The ending is tragic, like Shakespeare's 'King Lear' as well as his other tragedies.Kurosawa's films are absolutely soaked in realism, leaving no shred of romanticism behind.  Almost everything pertains to Japanese history (well, Kurosawa is Japanese).  Maybe I should word this better.  Almost everything is of a historical nature, and being a history major, I enjoyed it. 
The film is great and I'd recommend anyone who is interested in Asian history or foreign films.",Null,0,2,28 December 2002
The Bourne Supremacy," Great film!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERSI have not seen the first film and I was hesitant to see this.  Now I have seen it and I have not regretted my decision.'The Bourne Supremacy' is a great action flick involving international espionage, fist fights, and an intense car chase scene in downtown Moscow. Matt Damon is soooo cute.....but anyway, it did leave me on the edge of my seat.  The last 20-30 minutes are simply heart-pounding so don't walk out.I am not sure if I will rent the first film but if there's another one coming in the series, I will definitely see it.  I give this movie 3.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,1,1 August 2004
Cinderella Man," Great movie!
","A wonderful bio-pic of famous boxer James Braddock, the Cinderella Man who went from riches to rags and back to riches again. He inspired many individuals who were impoverished as a result of the Great Depression by giving them a sense of hope since he overcame poverty.It's really hard for me to say if this is better than 'Rocky' or not. I believe both are the same. My only gripe about the film is the profanity and abuses of deity. Other than that, everything is cool. Still, the jumpy camera angles during the fight scenes nearly gave me vertigo.I'm surprised boxers like James Braddock survived because of poor padded equipment and lack of adequate medical care.",10,0,0,3 June 2005
Jurassic Park," Butt-kicking action and a cool musical score, too!
","Let's face it.  Out of all the three movies in the JP movie series, this one just kicks butt.  It stayed the truest to Michael Crition's bestseller, unlike 'Lost World,' where it practically tore the story apart. 
The musical score in the movie is just absolutely breathtaking.  When I eventually get a DVD player, this film will definitely be in my collection!Excellent direction by Steven Spielberg and acting by Sam Neil as Dr. Alan Grant.",9,2,3,30 June 2002
Dodgeball," Well, uh....
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS ...it was quite interesting.  It had a good message to it (never give up and always go for your dreams).  However, the film is incredibly raunchy, filled with sexual humor, sexual references, and other stuff.  The violence is pretty much slapstick/Three Stooges fare...only worse. 
I did laugh at some gags but after watching guys get hit in the family jewels continually, the humor wasn't humorous.  I'm sure that there are other sports movies that have the same message and are a lot cleaner than this one.  I also didn't like Ben Stiller's character....reminds me of one of the kids that picked on me in middle school.2.75 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,0,22 June 2004
