Walk the Line," Over-rated
","I don't necessarily want to be spoon-fed a basic story, but some actual interesting events would have been nice? Possibly the only interesting thing in the whole film is Johnny's brave decision to play in the prison as a way of giving himself an identity as someone who gives hope to those who have lost it (and thereby giving himself reason to live). The endless live performances by the cast just frustrated the hell out of me, if I wanted to listen to the man in black live, I could just have bought the recording from Fulsome which would actually have been much better? His father randomly has an element of respect for him at the end of the film? How the hell did that happen? He just woke up one morning and decided 'son, you're the one with all the stories'? I just think the hyperbole which surrounds this film is totally unjustified. The plot is boring, the script is tepid and the cast, Witherspoon aside, totally forgettable. I don't even think it's a case for different people, different tastes, it's just an awful film with so many gaps in the story (which could have been filled by taking out the musical sections) it's just a waste of time to watch?",3,22,45,9 May 2006
