The New World," Down the Rabbit Hole
","If you enjoy the constant feeling that your missing something, like your eyes and ears have lost connection with your brain then go to this movie. I'm sure Malick had something in mind just not sure what. The only high points are the best 17th century living scenes on film. Oh yes I know there is the point that Europe messed up the perfect garden of the Americas, but that story is just a replay of the same thing happening throughout time and space. Change the century, change the spot on earth, and you can find the same romantic story of the sloths conquering the idyllic garden. This version is too pompous a rendition to waste time on.",1,2,9,4 February 2006
