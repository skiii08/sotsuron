The Blair Witch Project," Can't be the scariest ever if it can't scare a kid
","Shortly after this movie began, an annoying group of people entered the theater, sat down behind me, and started eating popcorn noisily.  They had a young child with them and deep down inside I hoped that the constantly whispering whelp would be traumatized by the much hyped fear-inducing power of this film.  Well, it didn't happen.  I moved so as not to hear the kid, but unless she was paralyzed with fear and was carried out on a stretcher without me realizing it (and that's not likely because her noisy folks would have talked about it) the movie had no appreciable impact on her.  A movie can't be the scariest movie ever made if it can't traumatize a young kid!  
The movie had no great impact on me either. I salute the concept and the risk, but it just wasn't all that scary.  Creepy maybe.  I did get goosebumps a few times, which is what the best ghost stories should give. But the movie takes way too long to gear up and when it does, the fear is not sustained. Also, I had trouble caring about the characters after a while.    Once again, I'll caution you about seeing preview materials.  The Sci-Fi Channel special is interesting.  In fact, I like it better than the film, which is the problem.  If you do see the movie, go in with as little information as possible, then unravel the mystery for yourself.  That's where I think the fun in this film could be.",Null,0,0,6 August 1999
