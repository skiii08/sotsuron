First Man," Right Stuff meets Das Boot, only less uplifting
","It would take me too long to go through all the reasons this movie was terrible. Suffice to say that after watching this, it's hard to believe that Neil Armstrong would ever have been let near a spacecraft much less chosen to command the first mission to land men on the moon. That alone should tell you what's wrong with this story. By comparison, Das Boot is uplifting. By comparison, the submarine in Das Boot was cleaner than the spacecraft shown in this movie. Ask yourself whether this makes sense. Ask yourself why anyone would want to depict events in this way.",3,1,2,1 August 2019
