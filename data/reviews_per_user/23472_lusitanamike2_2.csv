Captain Phillips," This movie deserved Best Picture
","First and foremost, this movie was THE best movie of 2013 and deserved a lot more attention. Tom Hanks is one of the best actors around and he consistently shows it through his movies. Captain Phillips is one of these examples, as Hanks takes on the role of Captain Phillips, who finds himself face to face with Somali pirates and no escape plan. This movie is a true nail-biter and I found myself on the edge of my seat when watching this, literally. Plot was amazing, with little to no flaws and it remained true to its story. The power that this movie delivers is also a huge plus, and it mainly derived from dialogue. When Barkhad Abdi stares into Hanks and says 'look at me...I'm the captain now' chills run down my back. I highly recommend this movie because it stays true to the storyline while delivering thrills at every corner. You won't be disappointed in this movie. Hanks has undoubtedly shined in his past movies, and Captain Phillips is yet another example of this success.",9,0,1,24 March 2014
12 Years a Slave," What did I just watch?
","I am going to be short and sweet with this review and say that this movie is absolutely awful. I decided to watch this movie because of all the hype and attention that was brought upon this movie. Unfortunately, what I got was poor plot, little character development, and scenes that made you want to leave the room. Let's be honest; it is not necessary to incorporate a 5 minute scene of Ejiofor staring into the distance. It is absolutely 100% boring and left me appalled on how this won best picture. The only reason why I gave this film a 3 was because of the superb acting by Lupita Nyong'o who gave the movie a small dose of hope, but it didn't last very long. Ultimately, I will never watch this movie ever again and I am utterly shocked that this won best picture. Movies like Captain Phillips and Dallas Buyers Club should have earned more recognition for their accomplishments, not this.",3,3,6,24 March 2014
