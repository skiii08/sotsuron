Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Add parts one and two together and you realize that Tarantino has created an amazing achievement. Bravo! Don't miss it!
","I've been an admirer of Tarantino ever since I walked into a cinema over ten years ago and watched 'Reservoir Dogs', not even knowing the guys name. 'Pulp Fiction' turned me from an admirer to a fan, and 'Jackie Brown' (still a most underrated movie) just made me appreciate his talent even more. To say I was eagerly anticipating his next movie is putting it mildly. But I was also ready to pick it to pieces. I'm no one-eyed fanboy. If 'Kill Bill: Vol.1' sucked I'd be the first to admit it. However it not only didn't suck, it blew my mind. I can't think of any other movie that has combined genres in such a dazzling way. Only Takashi Miike comes close, but in a different way. Tarantino adores trash movies and his enthusiasm came through in every frame. It was this excitement and lack of playing safe that really impressed me. He made the movie HE wanted to make regardless of whether a mass audience would 'get it'. If 'Vol.2' had been more of the same and nothing more I would have been well pleased, but once again Tarantino has topped himself. Part two is less action orientated and cartoon-like the first, and has more character development, and yes, genuine emotion. Sure there are still lots of fun moments (especially the tongue in cheek sequence featuring Gordon Liu as Pai Mei) and exciting fights, but the scenes between The Bride and Bill have surprising depth for what many regard as 'just' the ultimate popcorn movie. Add parts one and two together and you realize that Tarantino has created an amazing achievement. The casting is virtually flawless. Much like the Tarantino scripted 'True Romance' several actors get the opportunity to shine in supporting roles. Michael Madsen's confrontation with The Bride is one of the most memorable parts of the movie, and he and Daryl Hannah also share an unforgettable scene. Martial arts legend Gordon Liu, already mentioned, is an absolute hoot. Michael Parks, who played a Texas Ranger in Part 1 reappears as a completely different character, the sinister but charming Esteban Vihaio. Seventies favourite Bo Svenson has a nice bit as a Reverend, and Samuel L. Jackson is great as his organist. And it was really cool to see Jack Hill veteran Sid Haig's cameo as Jay the Bartender. All these actors help to make 'Kill Bill: Vol 2' a special treat, but the stand out performance is by David Carradine. Carradine has had an amazing career, but much like Dennis Hopper his appearances in dozens of b-grade action movies and mediocre straight-to-video dramas has made most film fans forget just how good he can be when given superior material to work with. Carradine has made over 140 movies and worked with such directors as Martin Scorsese, Roger Corman, Hal Ashby, Ingmar Bergman, Larry Cohen, Robert Altman, Walter Hill, Paul Bartel and yes, Fred Olen Ray, William Shatner and Fred 'The Hammer' Williamson. Hopefully his work in 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' will get him the attention he so richly deserves. The guy is a living legend people! Look, I'm a cynical old coot and spend most of my time whining about how poor most movies are these days, so it really REALLY warms my heart when something this damn good comes along! Bravo! Don't miss it!",Null,2,6,8 May 2004
Vertigo," Hitchcock's most stunning achievement. A fascinating masterpiece which improves with each year and viewing.
","I get a bit tongue-tied talking about Hitchcock's greatest movies because they are just so remarkable, so astonishing, so entertaining, so multi-levelled, that it's very difficult to put into words what makes them great. Hitchcock made some of the greatest movies ever made, and 'Vertigo', though by no means his most accessible film, is quite possibly his crowning achievement. It is without any doubt a masterpiece, and I cannot fault it in any way. Every time I watch it I am knocked out, and every time I see something new, some nuance or moment that I appreciate more than I did the previous viewing. Jimmy Stewart, one of the most popular movie star in Hollywood history, gives a remarkable performance throughout, one of the best in his career. Stewart had worked with Hitchcock before, and had always been superb, especially in the much copied suspense classic 'Rear Window' a few years prior to this, but he plays against type in 'Vertigo' and is jaw-droppingly good. It's difficult to remember now that 'Vertigo' is regarded as a movie milestone, that it received many bad reviews when it was originally released, and was a relative failure for Hitchcock. A lot of this had to do with Stewart's intense performance I think, and also the difficult subject matter. 'Vertigo' is essentially a tale of sexual obsession, something most people were probably not expecting at the time! Almost as good as Stewart is Kim Novak ('The Man With The Golden Arm') in a role that she will always be remembered for. 'Vertigo' is a virtuoso piece from Hitchcock, and a movie that will no doubt continue to inspire other film makers over the years to come. However the most important thing about it is that it is still  wonderful viewing, and a movie experience that you will never forget. In my mind it is one of the three of four greatest American movies. Simply astonishing.",Null,106,166,15 January 2003
Scarface," A crime classic! Quite possibly Brian De Palma's best film to date, and look ma, no Hitchcock!
","Brian De Palma was so good at making Hitchcock pastiches ('Sisters', 'Obsession', 'Dressed To Kill', all highly recommended) that he is often unfairly dismissed as a major American film maker. Those movies, as great as they are, are only a very small part of his output which has covered a lot of ground stylistically, from zany comedy ('The Phantom Of Paradise') to thought provoking drama ('Casualties Of War') to superior horror ('Carrie'). 'Scarface' is a case in point. Arguably his best movie overall, certainly his most entertaining, and it's a Mob thriller, with absolutely no Hitchcock connections. Leonard Maltin inexplicably dismissed this as slow. I really cannot see what he was getting at. 'Scarface' is full of energy and never lets up for a minute. The plot sucks you in immediately, and never lets you go. The movie almost reaches the three hour mark but it is so compulsive you'd think it went for half the time. De Palma is really on top form here, and the script by Oliver Stone (before he decided he was 'a serious artiste') is action packed AND character driven. Al Pacino gives one of his finest performances as Tony Montana, and he is supported by a first rate cast. Steven Bauer ('The Beast') in particular shows lots of potential, which sadly he has never fulfilled, mainly being trapped in b-grade hell ever since. Robert Loggia ('Lost Highway') and F. Murray Abraham ('Amadeus') are both excellent as Montana's 'friends', but also keep an eye out for Harris Yulin ('Training Day') as a corrupt cop, Paul Shenar ('The Big Blue') as a drug lord, and Mark Margolis ('Pi') as one of Shenar's 'soldiers'. All three actors rarely get a mention, but are just as good, if not better as the more celebrated performers in this film. Margolis is especially chilling as a Colombian hitman in a very different role to his invalid mathematician in 'Pi'. An extremely underrated actor! But hell, even Michelle Pfeiffer is good here as Montana's coked up 'ice queen' wife. It's really hard to fault ANY of the performances in the movie. 'Scarface' is a modern crime classic that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the best of Scorsese, Coppola, Ferrara, Takeshi or Tarantino. A superb movie experience that I cannot recommend highly enough!",Null,1,2,18 February 2003
Requiem for a Dream," Flashy, gimmicky, and emotionally empty waste of time.
","Being an admirer of Aronofsky's debut 'Pi' and a fan of Hubert Selby Jr's novels 'Last Exit To Brooklyn' and 'The Demon' I was expecting this to be the first GREAT movie of the decade but I was bitterly disappointed! What we have is a gimmicky directed, emotionally UNBELIEVABLE waste of a good idea. The only character who is half way realized is Ellen Burstyn's pitiful Sara Goldfarb. The other main characters are so thinly fleshed out and averagely acted that you end up with absolutely NO interest in their fate. In fact I couldn't even see any reason for Wayan's character to be in this movie at all, unless it was some PC reason to counter-balance Keith David's scummy role. All Wayans does is stare wistfully at his mother's photo and that's about it. I found the direction (unlike 'Pi') to be flashy, irritating and totally unnecessary! One shot of drugs being snorted and a close up of pupil's dilating was fine, but over and over and over?! And the fast motion sequences only reminded me of the chase scenes in 'The Benny Hill Show'.Lastly, what exactly is 'Requiem..' saying that we don't already know? If you take drugs you might get addicted and have to do 'bad' things?? Is that as profound as it gets? Aren't we all adults here? I fail to see what I'm supposed to think is so outstanding about this movie. And if you find this 'distressing', 'confrontational' and 'too difficult to watch' then all I can say is that you must live in a safe, Disney-fied world! Stick with your Julia Roberts movies...",Null,3,7,4 September 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Bring me the head of George Lucas!
","I was dragged along, not entirely against my will I will admit, to see this when it was first released. I thought then that it was one of the worst 'major' motion pictures I'd ever seen. When the movie was shown on TV a few days ago I thought I'd give it another look to see how I felt about it after all the hype had died down. Well I only lasted three quarters through it the second time, and I despised it even more. 'The Phantom Menace' is a truly awful movie on every level, with  a terrible script, pedestrian direction, clumsy editing, and hopelessly variable acting from the cast. Neeson and McGregor look embarrassed at having to spout the inane dialogue, Natalie Portman is beautiful but once again let down by the script, Jake Lloyd, all I can say is how on earth did he get cast? And the less said about the Stepin Fetchit alien Jar Jar Binks, arguably the most irritating 'character' in movie history, the better!Now look, I saw the original 'Star Wars' on its first release, and as a pre-teen I thought it was wonderful fun. But as the years went by and I caught up with the history of science fiction (movies and books) I began to realize the enormous damage George Lucas  has had on the genre. The first half of the 70s saw an unparalleled fertile period in written SF, with original, intelligent and challenging works from writers like Ballard, Dick, Silverberg, Delany, Russ, Aldiss, Watson, Disch, Le Guin and many others. Then Lucas comes along and drags SF, at least in the general public's minds, all the way back to the wizz-bang space opera days of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon, and adds a healthy dose of sword and sorcery. I don't think SF has ever completely recovered from that. 'The Phantom Menace' was an opportunity for Lucas to salvage the backward moves of the first three movies, but instead it's more of the same dumb sci fi action and low brow New Age drivel, but this time even LESS well done. Thanks a lot George, science fiction fans the world over owe you a big pat on the back!",Null,3,7,12 April 2002
The Ring," A lame remake of a lame movie.
","I seem to be one of the few people in the world that thought the original Japanese version of this movie ('Ringu') was utter crap. There have been some amazing horror and other kinds of disturbing movies coming out of Japan over the last several years (e.g. 'Battle Royale', 'Wild Zero', 'Freezer', 'Gemini', Takashi Miike movies like 'Audition' and 'Ichi The Killer') so to focus on 'Ringu' as an example of cutting edge film making is a joke. (sigh) So hear we have the Hollywood remake... I really didn't expect much of it considering the lameness of the source material, but it's actually a little lamer, with some 'Sixth Sense'-isms thrown in and some silly stuff involving horses, which didn't make any sense. But then not much makes sense in either version anyway. My main problem with both movies is that they just aren't frightening. At all. Not one little bit. My other problem - and I could easily have overlooked it if they WERE frightening - was the sheer stupidity of the plot. The initial premise of a killer video is okay, if not exactly original (David Cronenberg's astonishing 'Videodrome' twenty years ago dealt with something similar, a cable TV broadcast which caused life-altering 'hallucinations'), but the movie doesn't even stick with it, it goes into an increasingly ridiculous plot which has so many wholes in it (just who is making those phone calls by the way?) it's impossible to keep interested. And people say Dario Argento movies have stupid plots and cardboard characters! As to ex-Soap actress Naomi Watts, I just can't see what's so good about to her. The guy playing her ex, another 'Home And Away' veteran I think, he's pretty faceless, and Brian Cox, the one good actor in the movie, has little more than a cameo, which gives him little to work with. 'The Ring' is the most overrated horror movie since, well, 'Ringu'. And as far as I'm concerned anyone who thinks 'The Ring' is some kind of horror masterpiece can kiss mine.",Null,0,2,2 August 2003
Minority Report," Oh look, it's another dull big budget sci fi action film loosely based on a Philip K. Dick story. (possible spoilers)
","(Spoilers might follow) I think Steven Spielberg is one of the most overrated directors in film history, and Tom Cruise is a star (I hesitate to call him an actor) I can't stand, but as a Philip K. Dick fan of many years, I approached this movie with an open mind, hoping it was going to be THE great PKD adaptation. It isn't.  While there are some dazzling special effects on screen (something to be expected for a $100 million + budget!) it very quickly becomes your standard man-on-the-run action movie, just like 'Total Recall' and 'Impostor'. The script is pretty pedestrian, and is only loosely based on the original Dick short story 'The Minority Report'. A few basics are the same - a cop in charge of the Precrime division which works on information supplied by 'precogs' with apparent powers to foresee the future finds out he is going to kill a total stranger - but that's about it. In the story the Cruise character is an old man, there is no von Sydow character, the Precrime section can predict all kinds of crime, not just murder, the man Anderton is supposed to kill is completely different and for different reasons, the precogs themselves are idiots and Anderton doesn't kidnap one of them, and the whole idea of 'minority reports' is completely different. While the original story was far from Philip K. Dick's best work it was much more interesting and thought provoking (and much less predictable) than this movie. One has to wonder why Hollywood continually buys stories and then rewrites them into something almost unrecognisable, and invariably inferior. I also must wonder why they choose Philip K. Dick, one of the most cerebral and eccentric of science fiction writers, to adapt into ACTION MOVIES, instead of say, Robert Heinlein or Larry Niven or somebody more suitable.  Anyway, who knows. 'Minority Report' is yet another overblown disappointing science fiction movie where more thought has been put into the special effects than the script. Don't expect much and you might find it passable. Personally I would have thought it would have been better to have made it for a tenth or the budget and with someone like Lance Henriksen or even Jean Claude Van Damme as the stars and sent it straight to video.",Null,0,0,16 February 2003
Lifeboat," One of Hitchcock's best that rarely gets a mention. Don't overlook this one!
","'Lifeboat' must be extremely high on the list of THE most underrated Alfred Hitchcock movies! I very rarely hear anyone talk about this little gem, which is a damn shame as it is as good as many of Hitch's better known films. The plot is simple but the film makes the most of it with inventive direction, a strong script, and an interesting ensemble cast, most of whom are very good. I believe that Tallulah Bankhead irritates many people but I thought she was effective enough and well cast.  I must say I was much more interested in Walter Slezak who played the Nazi and John Hodiak the tattooed tough guy. Both were excellent performances that really added to my enjoyment of the movie. Anybody who likes Hitchcock who hasn't seen 'Lifeboat' is in for a treat. Don't overlook this one. It's dated in some ways sure, but still much more entertaining than 90% of today's so-called thrillers. I strongly recommend it.",Null,93,114,26 March 2003
Se7en," One of the most overrated 'thrillers' of all time! (possible spoilers)
","(Possible spoilers follow)The almost universal acclaim for this movie baffles me! I will give this movie one thing - visually it has some remarkable sequences. But in every other department it stinks. The bottom line is a cliched script that manages to be both pretentious and ultimately meaningless at the same time. We are supposed to believe that a serial killer meticulously plans the murders of complete strangers to symbolize the seven deadly sins (why? Nobody knows. Because 'John Doe' reads Dante is the closest we get to a motivation.) yet makes absolutely no effort to cover his tracks. The detectives on the case, one a veteran with one week to retire, the other a dim wit, who appear to have absolutely no idea about basic police procedure, still manage to capture said psychopathic genius via his library books! Because as we all know, anyone who reads 'The Divine Comedy', 'Helter Skelter' and 'Mein Kampf' MUST be a serial killer, right? To continue criticising the sheer stupidity and ludicrousness of the plot and the banality of the characters in this movie is just plain mean. The script is a mess, and no flashy lighting tricks will cover that up.  One of the most overrated movies of the decade by one of the most overrated directors currently working. 'Se7en' is a turkey, there's no other word for it.",Null,2,6,17 March 2002
The Big Lebowski," My favourite Coen brothers movie and one of the most entertaining and original comedies ever made!
","My favourite Coen brothers movie changes over the years as I watch and rewatch their amazingly original and consistently surprising oeuvre. When I first saw 'The Big Lebowski' on its original release I enjoyed it but thought it was a bit of a slight 'fun' movie with less depth than many of their previous works. Now, a few years and several viewing later, I have come to realise just how accomplished a movie it is, and it has become one of my all time favourite movies. Other film makers have attempted to weave together various genres, styles and images in a similarly eclectic, postmodern fashion, but few do it as seamlessly and with such wit as Ethan and Joel Coen. 'The Big Lewboski' is an extremely smart film, but it doesn't shout 'look at me! Aren't I clever?'. It sucks you in from the get go, and bottom line it is FUNNY, and as it is a comedy that's what counts the most! Everything about the movie is perfect, the script, the direction, set design, costumes, and the wonderful soundtrack (one of the most brilliant ever assembled, it includes lesser known Dylan and Elvis Costello numbers, Creedence classics, and songs from cult favourites like Yma Sumac, Captain Beefheart, Moondog, Esquivel and garage gods The Monks). Plus of course the actors, who are well cast and virtually flawless. Jeff Bridges ('Fat City', 'Starman') IS The Dude, and it's impossible to think of anyone else acting the role. Coen regulars John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Peter Stomare, and Jon Polito are all on board, as well as Julianne Moore ('Boogie Nights'), David Huddleston ('Capricorn One'), Philip Seymour Hoffman ('Magnolia') and Sam Elliot ('Mask'), even surprise cameos from Ben Gazzara ('The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie') and singer Jimmie Ray Gilmore. I can't fault 'The Big Lebowski', it is one of the most original and entertaining comedies ever made and a genuine modern classic. It's movies like this that keep me watching despite the endless mountain of mindless garbage that Hollywood continually spews out. If only every movie in the box office Top Ten was as inspired and amusing as this one!",Null,363,499,27 December 2002
Unbreakable," Uninteresting!
","Here I go thinking the last 2-3 years have been one of the poorest for Hollywood ever, and wonder just how stupid contemporary movies can get, then I watch 'Unbreakable' and am amazed that they can get even stupider! I was one of the few people on Earth who didn't go ga-ga over 'The Sixth Sense'. That movie was way to slow, had too many plot holes, and a 'twist' ending you could see a mile off. 'Unbreakable' does this all over again, but even more boringly, and like 'The Sixth Sense' is ultimately empty.
The thing that particularly irritates me about Shyamalan's movies is that they pander to audiences who are sick and tired of flashy, FX -filled, action movies with super fast cutting and nothing much to say. I'm actually one of those people! But just by slowing the pace to a stand still and throwing out the MTV-isms isn't enough, unless you replace them with believable characters and dialogue or some kind of substance or INTELLIGENCE. I can sit through sloooooow art house science fiction movies like Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' because it's WORTH IT. 'Unbreakable' simply isn't. This movie gives a lot of lip service to comic books but it is NOWHERE near as challenging and original as the best works of writers like Alan Moore or Warren Ellis. Read their comics, don't waste your time with this.",Null,0,1,31 August 2001
Memento," Fanboys and hardened movie buffs agree - this is something special!
","Every few years a movie comes along that internet nerd fanboys and hardened movie buffs alike agree is something special. 'Memento' is one of those movies. The first time I watched it in a cinema I was blown away. Subsequent viewings (I'm probably up to my fourth) take a little bit of the shine off it and the essential gimmickiness of it become more obvious. It also becomes apparent that Shelby's memory disorder is a bit too contrived and only seems to kick in (or not) at the most dramatically convenient moments. Some closer scrutiny will see the whole thing quickly fall apart. Still, there's no real point in being too picky with this movie. If you accept the premise at face value you are guaranteed a fascinating and involving film experience. Australian soap actor Guy Pearce ('Ravenous') is brilliant as Shelby, easily the best role of his career to date. The 'backwards' story telling of the movie (nicked most likely off Harold Pinter) was much talked about but it is Pearce's performance which really sells it. Joe Pantoliano ('The Sopranos') has too often been stuck in b-grade movies, so it's really good to see him given a more rewarding part. He seems to relish it and his chemistry with Pearce is really enjoyable. Likewise with Pantoliano's co-star in 'The Matrix' Carrie-Ann Moss. Moss can really act, and I hope this leads on to some substantial work for her in the future.  The underrated character actor Steven Tobolowsky ('Thelma And Louise') is also excellent in the important supporting role of Sammy Jankis, and a couple of actors I really like Mark Boone, Jr ('Trees Lounge') and Callum Keith Rennie ('Hard Core Logo') are both worth keeping an eye out for along the way. The hype surrounding 'Memento' may put many people off, but that would be a real shame as it just about lives up to it, and it's a very, very good movie. Highly recommended.",Null,7,13,25 March 2003
12 Monkeys," A brilliant movie. One of the very best science fiction movies of the 1990s, and one or Terry Gilliam's greatest achievements.
","I grew up on Python and have followed Terry Gilliam's subsequent directorial career for more years than I care to remember. Half his output leaves me cold, the other half dazzle me beyond belief. 'Brazil' is his movie that I would rate the highest, but I've come to think that I have unfairly underrated 'Twelve Monkeys'. I have always enjoyed it, but I've only come to realize just how good a movie it really is. Sometimes I think it is even better than 'Brazil'. It's a close pick. Unlike 'Brazil' Gilliam didn't come up with the script. He basically was initially involved as a director for hire. Thankfully the script itself (by David and Janet Peoples) is first rate. On top of that Gilliam manages to stamp his own style and approach on to the material without sliding into complete self-indulgence as he sometimes does. The budget of this movie wasn't anywhere near as large as you would imagine from the impressive results on screen. It looks superb. Gilliam coaxes  first rate performances out of Bruce Willis (quite a surprise) and Brad Pitt (not such a surprise, see also 'Johnny Suede' and 'Kalifornia'). Madeline Stowe is also very good, as is Christopher Plummer, and in a small but important role, David Morse. It's difficult to fault this movie. It is a joy to watch, and improves with each viewing. I also highly recommend Chris Marker's 'La Jetee', the short experimental film which inspired 'Twelve Monkeys'. It is also brilliant.",Null,115,153,24 January 2003
The Fifth Element," A terrible movie anyway you look at it!
","'The Fifth Element' is one of a very small handful of movies that no matter how many times I try to watch all the way through uninterrupted, I never quite succeed. I treasure the surreal movies of Lynch, Jodorowsky and Jess Franco, and closer to home, will watch 'Zardoz' at the drop of a hat. I can usually handle incoherent plot-lines, over the top characters, and movies with style over substance, but I draw the line at this self-indulgent mess. Ever tried to read a book when drunk? That's how I feel whenever I try and watch 'The Fifth Element'. There's something about this movie that I just can't get into. It often seems like you're watching an unreleased sequel to 'Buckaroo Banzai'. Except without the fun and energy of that cult classic. I really don't know what Luc Besson was trying to achieve here, but whatever it was, unless it was to make a cinematic migraine, it didn't work. The only thing of note about this movie is its eccentric supporting cast (Tiny Lister as the President?!) of comedians, Brits, musicians, Luke Perry and b-grade King, the late, great Brion James. Maybe in ten years time I'll come round to this, but right now I'll pass. This is just plain terrible!",Null,2,5,17 February 2002
The Others," Another winner from Alejandro Amenabar!
","'The Others' may be Alejandro Amenabar's most conventional film to date, but it is an effective and creepy old fashioned supernatural thriller, and continues the promise shown by his first two (highly recommended) movies 'Tesis' and 'Abre Los Ojos'. While I can't stand Nicole Kidman at the best of times I must admit she convinces as a nervous and overly protective mother trying to figure out the increasingly unsettling situation she finds herself in. This is arguably her best performance since 'Dead Calm' all those years ago. She is supported by two talented child actors (Alakina Mann and James Bentley, both making their film debuts), and a solid cast of character actors - Fionnula Flanagan ('How The West Was One'), veteran British comedian Eric Sykes ('The Plank'), Elaine Cassidy ('Felicia's Journey'), and (briefly) Christopher Eccleston ('Shallow Grave'). Genre fans will no doubt swiftly guess what is really going on, especially if the name Herk Harvey means anything to you, but that won't spoil your enjoyment of this well made, atmospheric and genuinely scary movie.",Null,1,2,1 June 2002
Ed Wood," One of Tim Burton's most enjoyable movies. An absolute hoot!
","'Ed Wood' is easily one of Tim Burton's most enjoyable movies. If you aren't familiar with the work of Ed Wood, specifically 'Glen Or Glenda', 'Bride Of The Monster' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space', you may not get as much out of this brilliant movie as you should, but that's your problem - educate yourself! Johnny Depp's mannered performances can often become irritating, but this time he fits in perfectly with this stylized fun. In fact it's difficult to think of many other contemporary actors who could pull this off as well as he does. Depp is supported by a well chosen and effective cast, including another spot on bit of casting with Martin Landau as horror legend Bela Lugosi, and fine work from Sarah Jessica Parker, Mike Starr, Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette, and Burton semi-regular Jeffrey Jones. There's also a memorable cameo from Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Welles in one of the movies stand out scenes. 'Ed Wood' is an absolute hoot, and one of the most entertaining movies of the 1990s. This is essential viewing for cult and horror buffs, and hopefully will encourage others to explore the weird and wonderful world of b-grade (and z-grade!) movies.",Null,3,3,15 August 2002
Insomnia," Once again an awful Hollywood remake of a brilliant European thriller!
","The original (Norwegian) version of Insomnia really impressed me, and was one of the most interesting twists on the standard cop-solves-murder formula I've seen for years. I really tried to keep an open mind about this remake, putting aside the examples of the lousy Hollywood remakes of brilliant European thrillers 'Spoorloos' ('The Vanishing') and 'Nattevagten' ('Nightwatch'), and saying to myself 'this time it's Christopher Nolan, it's gonna work out fine!' ('Memento' is one of my favourite movies of the last ten years). Even a quick glance at the DVD cover and the phrase 'cat and mouse game' jumping out didn't deter me. But after the opening scenes of the movie, noting that the cop (Pacino)'s partner (Martin Donovan) was considerably younger not older as in the original, hearing all the internal affairs sub-plot, I started to get a bad feeling. And then, after a crucial plot point I won't reveal for those who have yet to see the movie, there's a scene involving a dog... well as soon as that happened my heart sank and I said 'oh, I see what they're going to do. I know EXACTLY where they're going to take this'. Then the movie, much to my dismay, continued along it's cliched way, and every single thing that made the original so fresh and fascinating was thrown out the window! If you haven't seen the original you just won't know what you're missing, but believe me, it is so much better than this! It wasn't just the plot alterations and the expanding/changing of certain characters that ruined this movie for me, I also though Pacino's performance was lousy. I defy anyone to say that he is even CLOSE to the level of Stellan Skarsgard's superb performance in the original movie. I believed Skarsgard's character, I didn't believe Pacino's. I really don't know why Christopher Nolan would agree to direct a movie with such an awful, cliched script when 'Memento' showed he is capable of writing much more original and exciting scripts himself. 'Insomnia' is yet another example of an awful Hollywood remake of a superior European thriller. Please try and see the original, it is ten times better than this!",Null,1,2,14 July 2003
X-Men," Adequate I suppose, but really, I was expecting a LOT more!
","I'm not an 'X-Men' buff by any means, but I do read comics (though I prefer Vertigo to Marvel), and I love Bryan Singer's 'The Usual Suspects', so I was expecting a lot from this movie. I really hoped that this would finally be THE movie that takes comics seriously and takes them to the next level. Sadly it isn't. As comic adaptations go it's one of the better ones, but that's not high praise as most of them stink. Not being a fan I didn't mind that some details were played around with, but I did think that the script left a bit to be desired. The Bruce Davidson character and the McCarthy witchhunt aspects of the plot were heavy-handed and obvious, and basically all the potentially interesting ideas raised throughout the movie were never explored. Maybe if Singer had asked his talented former collaborator Christopher McQuarrie to write the script things would have been meatier and less predictable, I don't know. I did like the way the movie didn't get bogged down in origin stories or flashbacks, something that usually drags these kinds of movies down, but 'X-Men' really runs out of steam in the last third with an anti-climatic finale that fails to satisfy. Plus the movie is blatantly left open for the inevitable sequels, and this comes across as a very cynical move. The best thing about the film is the casting of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as Professor X and Magento respectively, both are much better than the weak material they have to work with. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Famke Janssen as Dr.Jean Grey were both good, but the rest of the cast were pretty dull, especially Halle Berry as Storm who might as well not have been in it.  So, a missed opportunity all round that is adequate but not much more. I hope the sequel is a big improvement but I'm not holding my breath.",Null,1,2,12 April 2003
Sleepy Hollow," Not perfect, but a hell of a lot of fun!
","Tim Burton's output has been a bit hit and miss, but he is always stylish and interesting, and 'Sleepy Hollow' is certainly both. While I was a bit disappointed with it on my first viewing (cinema, original release), re-watching it a couple of years later I enjoyed it much more, and could ignore its flaws, and just have fun. I must say it also looks MUCH better after his 'Planet Of The Apes' debacle!This is one sumptuous looking movie which oozes atmosphere. Burton has gone on record as being a major fan of Mario Bava, and this movie homages him on more than a few occasions. Johnny Depp gives a mannered, campy performance that doesn't (for the most part) irritate too much, Christina Ricci looks lovely and mysterious, and the two are supported by a smashing cast of first rate actors, including Michael Gambon ('The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover'), Miranda Richardson ('The Crying Game'), Michael Gough (the Batman series), and Burton semi-regular Jeffrey Jones ('Ravenous'), plus cameos from horror legend Christopher Lee, Martin Landau, and a well cast, wordless Christopher Walken.A very enjoyable romp with wit, chills, and more gore than you would expect.

The Beach," Strong contender for the worst movie of the decade! (so far!)
","Believe me, even though I had heard nothing but negative feedback about 'The Beach' I watched it with an open mind. My taste is so at odds with 90% of the mainstream that if a movie receives such a violent reaction as this I generally regard that as a GOOD thing, thinking I might actually like it. My list of favourite movies of the last ten years features many more so-called 'bad' movies than 'good' ones. However this time I'm with the Blockbuster crowd - 'The Beach' is a genuine turkey! In fact it's the worst movie I've seen so far this decade, and that includes 'Hannibal', 'Zoolander', 'Tomb Raider', 'The 6th Day', and frankly way TOO many others to even think about!Now look I'm not even a DiCaprio hater (though after this I'm leaning that way!). I have studiously avoided watching 'Titanic', but I thought he was pretty good in 'This Boy's Life' opposite De Niro, and more than adequate in 'Gilbert Grape' and 'The Quick and the Dead'. I even thought his self-parodic cameo was the only good thing in Woody Allen's 'Celebrity'. But Leo is SO obnoxious and unsympathetic as Richard that from the word go you truly do not give a damn about what happens to him, especially as he shows himself to be just as much a loser as the tourists and backpackers he claims to be so different from. The plot has more holes than a Mafia Don's corpse, and is yet another 'searing inditement' against the emptiness of Modern Life, that like 'Fight Club' wimps out at the end and has the rebel running back to the comforts of corporate America. Puh-lease! This ain't Nietsche for the New Millenium, it's Ferris Bueller for the Korn crowd. Director Danny Boyle showed so much promise with the taut thriller 'Shallow Grave' and the savvy junkie black comedy 'Trainspotting', but after giving us all a scare with the Godawful stupidity of 'A Life Less Ordinary' he has managed to top (or is that bottom?) himself with this embarassing stinker. Whether he will ever be able to redeem himself remains to be seen. The question is now, do we even care? I put myself through the torture of 'The Beach', but that could well be the limit of my endurance. Or maybe I'm just morbidly fascinated to see if Boyle is capable of making a movie WORSE than this. Is anybody??! I truly hope for all our sakes that the answer is no!",Null,0,1,7 December 2001
Alien," A horror classic that has stood the test of time! Still by far the best movie in the series.
","'Alien' while technically science fiction is also one of the greatest horror/suspense movies ever made. Ridley Scott is now one of the most well known and successful directors in Hollywood, but I don't think anything he's made in the last ten years is a patch on this perfect film, which is a near masterpiece in my opinion. In fact, on reflection there are only three Scott movies I genuinely like, those being his first three. The last of these 'Blade Runner' was released twenty years ago now, so to me Scott is long past his use by date. Whatever, 'Alien' itself is a brilliant piece of work, and is almost flawless. Scott's direction is superb and everything else about it is outstanding - a strong script from Dan O'Bannon et al, an evocative score from Jerry Goldsmith, brilliant design and special effects, including the amazing contributions from H.R.Giger, all add up to an amazing movie experience. I also really liked how the cast were character actors and not 'stars' so there was plenty of suspense generated as to who will live and who will die. This is something very few subsequent movies have done, 'Pitch Black' being one of the exceptions. Sigourney Weaver may be an icon as Ripley now, but when the movie was first released she was virtually unknown, having had a small cameo in Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and not much else. The rest of the cast are equally as good. I especially enjoyed Yaphet Kotto ('Blue Collar') and the legendary Harry Dean Stanton ('Wise Blood') as the wise cracking 'below deck' crew. Many people seem to prefer James Cameron's sequel 'Aliens' over this, but as I much prefer horror and suspense movies to action ones I think this is definitely the better movie, and still the strongest and most effective in the series. 'Alien' is a horror classic and an absolutely unforgettable movie that I can't recommend highly enough. If you haven't seen it before watch it immediately!",Null,192,275,12 December 2002
Taxi Driver," Best movie of the Seventies, and one of the greatest of all time.
","So much has been written and talked about 'Taxi Driver' that it seems almost redundant to add anything more. But watching it again the other night for the nth time I was, as I have been every single time I've seen it, struck by just how perfect this movie is. It is as powerful and disturbing now as it was twenty-five years ago. It has not only NOT aged, it gets better and more relevant every year. This is without doubt a modern classic, and one of the handful of truly great, timeless movies.Scorsese and Schrader went on to make other great movies after this, both separately ('The King Of Comedy', 'Light Sleeper') and together ('Raging Bull', 'The Last Temptation Of Christ'), but this is easily the best movie of their careers. And Robert De Niro's too. He has yet to top his stunning performance here as the deeply disturbed and alienated Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle, cabbie and would be assassin. This character has not surprisingly entered movie legend. Scorsese surrounds De Niro with a first rate supporting cast, including small but effective roles from Harvey Keitel ('Reservoir Dogs'), Peter Boyle ('Hardcore'), the underrated Victor Argo ('The King Of New York') and Joe Spinell ('Maniac'). Albert Brooks and Jodie Foster are also very good, and even Cybil Shepherd, the butt of many jokes, is fine as Bickle's obsession.
When you combine these actors, Schrader's outstanding script, and Scorsese's brilliant direction, with the stunning cinematography (Michael Chapman) and haunting score (Hitchcock fave Bernard Herrmann's final effort), you have yourself a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. If you haven't seen 'Taxi Driver' I urge you to do so immediately. It is a masterpiece, pure and simple.",Null,143,209,4 June 2002
Lost in Translation," 'Lost In Translation' is one of the worst examples of style over substance I've seen in a long, long time.
","To be honest I avoided watching 'Lost In Translation' when it was first released. I thought Sofia Coppola's 'The Virgin Suicides' was nice to look at, had some cool music, but was ultimately empty and pointless. I expected 'Lost In Translation' to be more of the same. After my first viewing this is exactly what I thought. There's some lovely visual images sure, and some wonderful music on the soundtrack. A cynic (who me?) could be forgiven for assuming that this is what you should expect to get when you hire a talented cinematographer (Lance Acord) to film on location in Tokyo, and employ a savvy musical director (former Redd Kross drummer Brian Reitzell) who knows his stuff (My Bloody Valentine, Peaches, Air, Rick James, Nick Lowe via Elvis Costello, The Jesus And Mary Chain). The combination of the music and the images is, I'll be the first to admit, frequently striking. I appreciated it aesthetically but it's something you'll frequently see in music videos, and dare I say it, TV commercials. Call me old fashioned, but when we're dealing with movies, aesthetics alone aren't enough for me. I like to either have an interesting story, or characters with depth, or some kind of insight into the human condition, or, as this IS a comedy, some big laughs. L.I.T. has none of these! Now look, Bill Murray is a cool dude, I agree, and Scarlett Johansson is very easy on the eye, but Coppola's script gives them very little to work with, so if I must blame someone, I must blame her.  I watched the movie a second time to see if I was being fair to it. Now the second time, not only were the failings I saw the first time around magnified, something else happened. I began to really dislike these two characters. Bob Harris, a successful movie star, full of angst because he has to make a cheesy TV commercial for a couple of million? Middle class slacker Charlotte has such a tough life because she takes 'mediocre' photos and hates her own writing? Please, some people actually have REAL problems! I felt the same way watching 'The Virgin Suicides', whose underlying message appeared to be, 'boy, it's sure tough being a good looking girl'. Both movies demonstrate the shallowness of Sofia Coppola's work. I don't feel any empathy for these people. Maybe a talented film maker could make that happen, but as it is I became more and more irritated by the movie. And the condescending attitude towards the Japanese didn't help things any. I found it interesting that when I watched the behind the scenes footage on the DVD, Coppola is shown surrounded by cool locals with good English skills, yet in her movie almost all the locals either can't speak English at all, or if they do they do they speak 'Ingrish' ala Mickey Rooney in 'Breakfast At Tiffanys'. This really started to grate on me after a while. Japanese people and culture in this movie are only good for a few cheap laughs it seems, or as 'interesting' background for our two spoiled, self-centered protagonists. 'Lost In Translation' is one of the worst examples of style over substance I've seen in a long, long time. Many film buffs are falling over themselves to hail this movie as some kind of masterpiece. They are mistaken. Watch a documentary on Japan while listening to 'Loveless', it's just as satisfying.",Null,1,5,31 May 2004
Fargo," The Coen's mainstream breakthrough is still one of their best.
","The Coen brothers movies thrive on irony so it's very apt that after their attempt at a big Hollywood picture 'The Hudsucker Proxy' flopped they went the opposite way with 'Fargo' and it turned out to be their breakthrough into the mainstream. Because this movie was such a popular success it's easy for long time fans to overlook it while praising lesser known Coen classics like 'Miller's Crossing' and 'Barton Fink'. But the thing is 'Fargo' deserved the success because it's a very fine movie and still one of the best things they ever did. I've seen it four of five times and every time I do I slap my forehead with a 'hot damn! this is GOOD!'. The acting in 'Fargo' is almost like a master class, especially from Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. McDormand is of course married to Joel Coen and co-starred in the brothers debut 'Blood Simple', but her performance as Marge Gunderson, one of the nicest cops in cinema history, really made people sit up and take notice. This is Macy's only Coen movie to date, which is a shame, because he relishes dialogue and they come up with some of the best since Macy's mentor David Mamet. Steve Buscemi also gives a comic gem of a performance as an inept kidnapper hired by Macy. It's no surprise that the Coens have worked with him so regularly, he's just great. I always say that my favourite Coen brothers movie is the most recent one I've watched, so that means this week it's 'Fargo', a brilliant movie that shouldn't be missed by any film buff. If you've seen it before, watch it again. It's the kind of movie which deserves repeated viewings.",Null,0,0,13 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Well at least it was better than 'Phantom Menace'!
","I was dragged to see 'The Fellowship Of The Ring Last' (the opening day here in Perth). I won't exaggerate and say 'kicking and screaming' but I certainly wasn't looking forward to it. I've never been able to stomach Tolkien. After reading 'The Hobbit' as a young child I was never able to finish any of his other books. Mervyn Peake is the guy for me, I'm afraid.Anyway, the books are not what this is about, it's the movie. Is it any good? The short answer - for kids possibly yes, for adults no. It's really hard to see how anyone over the age of say fifteen could spend more than ten minutes even thinking about this movie after having watched it. It just isn't worth it. All I can say is that it wasn't as embarrassing as the trite 'Phantom Menace'. But is that what we have come to? Even pretending that movies like 'Harry Potter' and 'Pearl Harbor' and 'Titanic' and this one are even worth discussing?  If anyone can truly fool themselves into thinking that 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' or the other recent 'blockbusters' I mentioned are to be mentioned in the same breath as 'The Wizard Of Oz' or 'Casablanca' or 'Lawrence Of Arabia' or 'The Thief Of Baghdad' or 'Spartacus', movies that truly enriched the imagination, then you're welcome to it.This movie was torture to sit through. Millions of dollars spent, sure, but an empty, uninvolving experience. Cardboard characters going through a series of endless 'adventures', on and on and on and on. Elijah Wood's stunned mullet expression, wide-eyes-perpetually-on-the-verge-of-tears, worked well enough in Ang Lee's 'The Ice Storm', but irritated me beyond belief here. He hasn't the star quality to carry this movie, let alone two sequels. And his fellow hobbits, the guy from 'The Goonies' and two interchangable twits, I'm supposed to empathize with these idiots? At least the rest of the cast aren't as bad, though it makes you cringe to see British veterans Ians McKellern and Holm dragged out to give it some kind of credibility (?), and poor Christopher Lee (one of my childhood idols) having to be involved in this tripe! But even legends have to pay the bills I suppose. The only good thing about the overlong bore is that it will hopefully make the wonderful Viggo Mortensen the star he has been threatening to be since Sean Penn's underrated 'The Indian Runner' ten years ago. Mortensen steals every scene he is in. He's great, the movie isn't. That's all folks.",Null,2,5,27 December 2001
The Thing," John Carpenter's masterpiece of paranoia!
","Unfortunately I spend much of my time berating John Carpenter in regards to his recent lazy and mediocre efforts. What a refreshing change it is to relive his earlier  seminal work and remember just why he once had a reputation as one of America's most exciting and inventive film makers! 'The Thing' is quite possible the best movie Carpenter has ever made, and sadly it seems, ever will make. He is at the height of his powers with this dark, tense and claustrophobic thriller, and is blessed with a superb ensemble cast, and (a rarity for him these days) a decent script will believable, fully rounded characters. Kurt Russell gives his best work for Carpenter here, in arguably his strongest performance to date. The supporting cast is flawless, and includes fine character actors such as Wilford Brimley ('Cocoon'), Keith David ('Dead Presidents'), Richard Dysart ('Being There'), Richard Masur ('Who'll Stop The Rain)', and Donald Moffat ('The Right Stuff'). I highly recommend the DVD version of this movie which features one of the most entertaining and informative commentaries I've ever heard. (from Carpenter and Russell) Much maligned when it was first released, 'The Thing' now looks like a masterpiece of paranoid science fiction, one of the very few remakes that surpasses the original version, and absolutely essential viewing for any self respecting horror or SF fan. It really doesn't get much better than this! Highly recommended!",Null,6,12,24 September 2002
American Psycho," Watered-down disappointment.
","I had high hopes for 'American Psycho' but was largely disappointed. Anyone who has read the book and can still praise this movie is a fool. The whole thing reeks of compromise to me. The book was a satire on 80s yuppie rampant consumerism true, but ALSO an examination of violence. By emphasizing the satire and down-playing the violence (there is very little, and it is largely implied), Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have turned what could have been a milestone EVENT of confrontational cinema into an average comedy with a few laughs, and less blood than an 'Evil Dead' or Romero zombie flick. While I understand it would be impossible to film the most extreme scenes in the book, I still think more disturbing images were required to make this more than say, The Cell or Hannibal. The audience I watched this with laughed at the corporate culture and Huey Lewis jokes, but they also laughed at Bateman running around with a chainsaw, just like it was Itchy and Scratchy. No-one was DISTURBED or CONFRONTED. Is this the way it was meant to be??What 'American Psycho' needed was David Cronenberg say, or (and I can't believe I'm typing this!) Oliver Stone. Yeah, Mr.Subtle. But 'American Psycho' ISN'T a subtle book, and the movie cries out for the vision Stone showed in 'J.F.K' and closer to home, 'Natural Born Killers', not the watered-down, playing-it-safe mediocrity we have here.I must, however, praise Christian Bale's largely excellent William Shatner-esque performance. He tries his best with the material at hand, but as I said, the script just doesn't cut it. Read the book instead.",Null,0,3,1 July 2001
American Beauty," Yes, it really is as good as everyone says. One of the finest movies of the last ten years.
","I have such low expectations of contemporary Hollywood that if I go and see something and I manage to keep my lunch down afterwards I'm happy. So to actually be able to sit in a theatre and watch a genuinely inspired and original piece of film as this is a very special occasion these days. Way too many current movies are aimed at 16 year olds and have more care and attention lavished on the media promotion and merchandising rights than the movie itself, so it's a real treat to see a movie aimed at adults, with characters you can empathize with, a witty and complex script, first rate acting,  fresh direction and splendid cinematography. Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career as suburban rebel Lester Burnham. He is the obvious focal point of the movie, but I was also impressed by relative newcomers Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari, and also the seriously underrated Chris Cooper ('Lone Star'). The only minor quibble I have with the movie is Annette Bening's character, which to me doesn't have the depth of the others, and often just comes across as a stereotypical shrewish wife. Apart from that, it's difficult to fault 'American Beauty'. A recent second viewing on DVD was just as enjoyable and impressive as my first viewing on its original cinema release. Yes, this is one movie that really does live up to the hype. A modern classic that cannot be recommended highly enough. Bravo!",Null,3,6,14 October 2002
Being John Malkovich," Wow! A mind-blowing cinematic debut from Jonze and Kaufman. A surreal, hilarious, thought provoking, genre-busting classic.
","'Being John Malkovich' is simply one of the most stunningly original and inventive movies ever made. To think it is the movie debut of a video clip director (Spike Jonze) and an unknown TV sit-com writer (Charlie Kaufman) makes it an even more impressive achievement! If this brilliant movie is any indication of their talents the two are headed straight for the top of the heap. What I particularly admire about this movie is that in manages to pile strange situation on top of strange situation without being gimmicky, and the way it manages to discuss weighty topics like creativity and identity without losing sight of the fact that it is a comedy, and an extremely funny one at that. The three leads John Cusack ('High Fidelity'), Catherine Keener ('Johnny Suede') and Cameron Diaz ('There's Something About Mary') are all wonderful, especially the unexpected casting of the latter two actresses, the first of many, many surprises in this hugely enjoyable and mind-blowing trip. And what can you say about John Malkovich himself? The man is now a certifiable legend for even agreeing to participate in this movie, on top of that his performance is wonderful and multi-layered. The rest of the supporting cast led by veteran Orson Bean ('Innerspace') are all excellent, and there are several amusing cameos, especially a scene stealing turn from Charlie Sheen which more than makes up for his many hammy performances over the years. I cannot praise this movie highly enough! It is a surreal, hilarious, thought provoking, genre-busting classic, and one of the very best movies made in the last twenty years. Yes, it's simply THAT good.",Null,4,8,28 December 2002
Spider-Man," This movie is like a pack of chips. Enjoyable at the time but ultimately unsatisfying.
","I went into 'Spider-Man' expecting the worst, and left it slightly surprised that it wasn't anywhere near as awful as I'd expected. But that's about it, and is that really enough? While a cut above recent blockbuster embarrassments like 'Star Wars Episode 1', this movie is still just glorified teen fare, and NOT the great comic book movie we're all hoping for. Maybe one day if Terry Gilliam ever gets his 12 hour adaptation of Moore and Gibbons 'Watchmen' to the screen we'll be suitably knocked out, but until then 'Spider-Man' is really not all that special, no matter what the hype machine and renta-quote crowd are trying to make you believe.
The two things this movie has going for it is Sam Raimi's direction, and the casting of Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe. Raimi has made some juvenile crap in his time (see 'Army Of Darkness'), but 'Evil Dead' is still a classic, and even his 'failures' like 'Crimewave', 'Darkman' and 'The Quick and the Dead' are highly underrated enjoyable popcorn movies. (and it must be said, all better than this) Tobey Maguire may not be the greatest actor of his generation but he personable enough when given decent material to work with ('Pleasantville', 'The Wonder Boys'), and suits Peter Parker's likeable nerdiness. The charismatic Willem Dafoe has given some brilliant performances over the years in overlooked movies ('The Last Temptation Of Christ', 'Wild At Heart', 'Light Sleeper'). He isn't required to do all that much here in a duel role as Norman Osborn, driven scientist/businessman, and nutjob super-villain The Green Goblin, but he gives it his best shot, and is always watchable at the very least.There's not much more to be said about 'Spider-Man'. It does what it is sets out to do, no more and no less, and you'll be hard stretched to remember anything much about it in two years time, but that seems to be all that we can really expect from this kind of movie these days. That really isn't good enough, of course, but that's unfortunately the way things are.",Null,0,3,24 June 2002
Dark City," One of the most underrated science fiction movies of the decade.
","'Dark City' is a fascinating and atmospheric slice of Phildickian film noir. Director Alex Proyas has always been visually outstanding (see his overlooked debut 'Spirits Of The Air...') and his aesthetic nous, combined with an above average script (which he co-wrote) makes this an outstanding work of imagination. An eclectic and interesting cast of American, British and Australian actors is another plus. For my money, 'Dark City' ranks alongside 'Cube' and 'Strange Days' as the most underrated science fiction film of the decade.Many have (quite rightly) pointed out the connections between 'Dark City' and 'The Matrix'. I won't belabor the point, suffice to say that in my mind 'Dark City' plus Grant Morrison's cult comics 'The Invisibles' = 'The Matrix'. 'Dark City' stands on its own however, so forget about the Wachowski brothers, and watch this with an open mind. I guarantee you will be impressed.",Null,1,3,30 March 2002
The Usual Suspects," A stone cold CLASSIC!
","'The Usual Suspects' has received a lot of comment for its killer twist ending, which while by no means the first in movie history, has proved to be enormously influential (stand up Messrs. Fincher and Shyamalan...). But this movie is so much more than a surprise ending! It is a meticulously scripted, faultlessly acted masterpiece that stands up to repeated viewings. Every single time I watch it I notice some new detail, or get more enjoyment out of a performance or scene. This movie really put  Kevin Spacey on the map, but everyone in the ensemble cast is outstanding, even Stephen Baldwin(!), who has never appeared in a movie this good before, or since.  I also got a kick out of the Paul Bartel ( 'Death Race 2000', 'Eating Raoul') cameo, and the ultra-cool Peter Greene's ('Laws Of Gravity', 'Pulp Fiction') all too brief appearance. Bartel is sorely missed, and Greene one day (mark my words!) will become the star he deserves to be.Director Bryan Singer has yet to live up to the promise shown here with his subsequent movies, the average 'Apt Pupil' and the disappointing 'X-Men'. For all the acclaim he and the (admittedly superb) cast have received, the real star of 'The Usual Suspects' is Christopher McQuarrie's sensational script, one of the finest of the modern era, and one that genuinely deserved it's Oscar.It really doesn't get any better than this!!

Resident Evil," A horror movie with no scares, and one of the dullest 'action' movies I've ever endured.
","Making movies based on video games is A BAD IDEA. There, I've stated the obvious. Obvious to most of us maybe, but apparently not Hollywood, who despite the fact that there has NEVER been a good one made, have done it yet again. 'Resident Evil' is 'inspired' by the popular zombie butt-kicking game of the same name. A game I have never played, and after sitting through this tedious, overblown bore, never ever will. Okay, to be fair, I've been told that the movie bears little resemblance to the game. I really couldn't care less. As a movie it stinks. Obviously taking the overrated but still enjoyable 'The Matrix' as its model, 'Resident Evil' totally lacks any of the excitement and freshness of the latter movie. I think you just have to look at Paul 'B.S.' Anderson's CV to work out the reason why. The movie combines action and horror in such a way as to be both frenetic and dull simultaneously, and without any chills or thrills whatsoever. To make a zombie movie with absolutely NO horror in quite an achievement. Milla Jovovich best known for the dreadful sci fi mess 'The Fifth Element' is not someone who I hold a torch for. She has only been in one good movie to date ('Dazed And Confused'), and I can hardly remember who she played in it. She is without doubt a beautiful woman, but I can't think of any other reason to praise her. Milla's sidekick is played by the spunky Michelle Rodriguez who impressed me in her debut 'Girlfight', but who has made lame action movies ever since. Her character here is a walking cliche, a kick ass tough talking Latina seemingly cloned from the one played by Jenette Goldstein in James Cameron's 'Aliens', a movie which is ten times more exciting than this. The only other actor I recognized in the cast was Eric Mabius ('Welcome To The Dollhouse'), but hell, I was battling to stay awake throughout. I nearly gave up after the first twenty minutes, but decided I must at least watch until the supposedly 'classic' doberman scene, which turned out to a snooze. After that things didn't get any better. If you want to see a genuinely scary zombie movie try some Romero or Fulci classics, or the underrated 'Living Dead At Manchester Morgue', and if you want to see a thrilling and engrossing SF death trap thriller go no further than 'Cube' (or pick up a copy of Algis Budrys' classic 'Rogue Moon'). If you want to play Resident Evil play Resident Evil, just don't bother sitting through this garbage.

The Dirty Dozen," Smell the testosterone! The Dirty Dozen is the quintessential 'guys on a mission' movie!
","Quentin Tarantino looks like he just might follow through with his threat to make the ultimate 'guys on a mission movie' if he gets his 'Inglorious Bastards' on to the big screen, but he'll be pushed to equal 'The Dirty Dozen', the quintessential movie in the genre. 35 years on and it's still one of the best WW2 adventure movies, and a strong contender for the ultimate guys movie. It shouldn't be taken too seriously - I don't think anyone is going to argue it's a realistic depiction of war - but it's still one of the most entertaining movies around, and it's impressive collection of tough guys and character actors is really hard to beat. Director Aldrich had previously made the classic noir 'Kiss Me Deadly' (starring Ralph Meeker who reappears here in a supporting role) and the wonderfully creepy 'Whatever Happened To Baby Jane', but this is arguably going to be THE movie he's remembered for. Screen legend Lee Marvin ('Point Blank', 'The Killers') with the assistance of his Sgt (Richard Jaeckel), must train a motley collection of criminal and misfits (including John Cassavetes, Jim Brown, Telly Savalas, Charles Bronson, Clint Walker and Donald Sutherland), for a suicide mission behind enemy lines. Marvin is just great, extremely cool and charismatic, but also a fine actor, something which is often overlooked. The ensemble cast (which also includes George Kennedy, and two future stars of 'The Wild Bunch', Ernest Borgnine and Robert Ryan) are uniformly excellent, but Cassavetes is particularly outstanding, Sutherland is memorable as a half wit, and Savalas is unforgettable as the religious psychopath Maggott. 'The Dirty Dozen' is first class entertainment and highly recommended. It put 90% of today's 'action movies' to shame!",Null,44,51,8 June 2003
Tigerland," Seen it all before, BETTER.
","This was hyped to me as 'Joel Schumacher goes Dogme'. Yes, Hollywood schlockmeister Schumacher, responsible for crap like 'St Elmo's Fire' and 'The Lost Boys' and the man who made two absolutely awful Batman movies, attempts to recreate the likes of raw and powerful Danish dramas 'Festen' and 'The Idiots'. Now it sounded like a recipe for disaster to me but I was intrigued enough to give it a shot... My immediate reaction is that the Dogme angle is extremely misleading. The movie uses similar hand held camera work and lack of 'blockbuster' touches but it in no way captures the intensity and honesty of Vinterberg or Von Trier. This IS Joel Schumacher after all. I suppose it shows you that it is talent and not technique that really matters. I had two main problems with 'Tigerland'. One is Colin Farrell who I have absolutely no interest in. Apparently he's supposed to be something special, but I really don't see it. As an actor and as a character I just couldn't into what he was doing. The movie is a love letter to Bozz and if you feel nothing towards him then there's really very little left. The other problem is that we've seen it all before, BETTER. I'm trying not to use these three words but I can't help myself - Full Metal Jacket. There, I did it. 'Tigerland' is pretty forgettable. I'm nearly sure that in a couple of years I won't remember one thing about it yet I can remember scenes from 'Full Metal Jacket' like it was yesterday, only I haven't watched it since about 1989.

28 Days Later...," 'The Crazies' meets 'The Omega Man'. Long term horror buffs have seen it all before - and better.
","Let me get one thing off my chest - this is NOT a zombie movie! A zombie is a reanimated corpse. There are no zombies in '28 Days Later...' Much has been made about this movie being a George Romero tribute, and in some ways it is. While there are some parallels with Romero's underrated 'Day Of The Dead' in the latter half of the movie when Christopher Eccleston and co. turn up, it's actually closer to being a remake of 'The Crazies' than his Dead movies. I suppose that more people have seen 'Night Of The Living Dead' and 'Dawn Of The Dead' than 'The Crazies', so that's their main reference point, but believe me, 'The Crazies' is much more accurate. 'The Crazies' with a bit of 'The Omega Man' thrown in. And that to me is the major problem with Danny Boyle's uneven movie - it's just all too familiar. Long term horror buffs have seen it all before - and better. The movie starts off well with a dazed Jim (Cillian Murphy) wandering the streets of an apparently deserted London. These opening sequences are some of the best in the movie and conjure up memories of Vincent Price in 'The Last Man On Earth' and Charlton Heston in 'The Omega Man' (both movies were inspired by Richard Matheson's novel 'I Am Legend'). Soon other characters are introduced and the movie is reasonable enjoyable, albeit a bit predictable and lacking any real depth. Around the half way point I was expecting some new spin, something fresh and original... and it never comes. It's funny but I really expected a lot more from this movie and it failed to deliver, but 'Dog Soldiers', which I expected next to nothing from was much more entertaining in my opinion. So if you're looking for a horror/action movie with fun and thrills check out 'Dog Soldiers', it really delivers.  And if you want to see the 'inspirations' for '28 Days Later...' rent some Romero, specifically 'The Crazies', or how about Cronenberg's 'Shivers'? Both of those movies are ten times more original and disturbing than this, and probably made on a tenth of the budget.",Null,9,17,5 April 2004
Velvet Goldmine," A confused, self-indulgent mess of a movie.
","After watching 'Velvet Goldmine' for a second time I still have absolutely no idea what Todd Haynes was trying to achieve. He could have approached it as a straightforward biopic of Bowie and 70s glam (with the names changed to protect the 'innocent' if need be), OR as a surreal, camp fantasy equal parts Ken Russell, Russ Meyer and Grant Morrison (Zenith, Doom Patrol, The Invisibles). But by doing both, or rather, neither, it's ends up a confused bore that pleases nobody. As an Eno fan I was happy to hear quite a lot of his (and Roxy Music's) songs used on the soundtrack, and some of the Bowie pastiches were very good also, but I find 'Velvet Goldmine' to be overlong and ultimately unsatisfying. I also think Haynes not entirely accurate equation of glam rock equaling homosexuality sheds more light on him than the actual era. The movie is more a post-Morrissey look at glam than a truthful document of an exciting and innovative musical period. 'Velvet Goldmine' contains a few enjoyable moments but not enough to recommend it. A great movie could be made about Bowie but this isn't it.",Null,24,34,18 April 2002
Good Will Hunting," A cliched, sentimental, empty experience
","Sometimes I think I'm living on another planet to rest of the movie going public! How this mediocre piece of rubbish earned ANY praise, let alone an Oscar is truly beyond me. I sat through this movie with its predictable by-the-numbers plot and cliched characters (the misunderstood genius from the wrong side of the tracks, the wounded 'teacher' who gets healed from his 'pupil', the rich girl who is REALLY NICE when you get to know her and loves the poor boy for HIMSELF) and had to stop myself from laughing out loud at the ridiculousness of it! This is supposed to be a GREAT MOVIE??! Get a grip people!Van Sant what happened to you?? I can't believe all the promise you showed with Drugstore Cowboy and My Own Private Idaho (both ten times better than this). Now we have Good Will Hunting and the AWFUL, pointless remake of Psycho. I shake my head in disbelief.Only positive thing I can say is there are a few lovely Elliot Smith songs on the soundtrack. Buy one of his albums and avoid this movie at all costs.",Null,2,5,25 June 2001
The Elephant Man," David Lynch's most accessible work. A truly remarkable film!
","I first watched 'The Elephant Man' over twenty years ago, not long after it was released. It was the first David Lynch movie I ever saw, thought at the time I'd never even heard about 'Eraserhead' and knew nothing about the guy. I was incredibly impressed by the film, as I have been every time I watch it. Eventually I became a big Lynch fan, and could see the similarities between 'Eraserhead' and 'The Elephant Man', both visually and in their use of sound. Apart from that, they are very different movies. 'Eraserhead' still freaks most people out, but 'The Elephant Man' is arguably his most accessible film. It has heart and an emotional impact, something rare in Lynch's movies ('The Straight Story' is another exception). Anthony Hopkins is an actor I've frankly had it up to HERE with, especially after his increasingly hammy Dr. Hannibal Lecter, but boy, is he wonderful here! Probably his finest performance to date. Of course John Hurt is superb too, especially taking into consideration him having to work under pounds of make up. It's hard to fault anybody in the supporting cast, especially John Gielgud and Hannah Gordon, who plays Hopkins wife. Freddie Jones, who Lynch has worked with a few times since, is really evil as Bytes, and the late Michael Elphick ('The Element Of Crime', 'Withnail and I') plays another memorable baddie as the hospital's night porter. 'The Elephant Man' is a remarkable achievement. Lynch doesn't seem to have compromised his unique vision one bit and yet manages to make a genuinely moving drama about one of the screen's most unlikely heroes. I don't throw the term 'masterpiece' around lightly but it's difficult not to use that word when describing this truly extraordinary film! Simply one of the best movies I've ever seen.",Null,28,29,3 February 2004
The Game," Boring, uninvolving, silly and pointless. Need I go on?
","'The Game' is yet another stinker from one of the most overrated film makers in Hollywood today, David Fincher. I could forgive the innumerable plot holes and general dumbness of this alleged thriller if I could actually feel some interest in pompous businessman Nicholas Van Orton's (a particularly dull performance from Michael Douglas) fate. And I could overlook Fincher's time wasting pretensions if it actually succeeded as a Hitchcockian man-on-the-run roller coaster ala 'The 39 Steps' or 'North By Northwest', but this overblown rubbish is such a chore to sit through that you'll breathe a sigh of relief when it finally ends. After that you'll ask yourself what the point of it all was. And you know what? There isn't one. Wanna absolutely waste two hours of your life? Then 'The Game' is tailor made just for you!",Null,1,5,12 May 2002
Pi," Fascinating psycho thriller made on a shoe string budget.
","'Pi' is a great example of the best things about low budget independent movie making. Ideas are more important than money, and good acting more interesting than special effects. It's a pity mainstream Hollywood ignores this time and time again. Aronofsky really gets value for his dollar here - the movies looks stunning. The script is original and involving, and the acting is first rate. The real find here is Sean Gullette in a very impressive debut. He also co-scripted this fascinating looks at mathematics, madness and mysticism. Highly recommended.",Null,1,2,3 October 2002
Mulholland Drive," Lynch's worst movie since 'Dune'.
","Boy, it makes me laugh to read all the pretentious twits try and justify this waste of time. I'm a long time David Lynch fan but at least I can admit that this flawed 'movie' is ultimately pointless. Lynch takes a potentially superb pilot to a proposed (and rejected) TV series, tacks on an unsatisfactory 'ending' and sells it to the big screen. The first two thirds of the movie are hypnotic and full of suggestive future possibilities and plot directions. The contrived final scenes spoil what has gone before and pose more questions than answers. There's no point trying to figure out a 'meaning' to this, because there is none. Anyone talking about the how 'Mulholland Dr.' symbolizes this, or is an allegory for that, is completely fooling themselves. As a TV series this could be fantastic, and better than 'Twin Peaks'. As a movie it sucks.",Null,2,7,10 March 2002
The Evil Dead," An indisputable horror classic, still as fresh and frightening as the day it was made.
","Sam Raimi is currently getting a lot of attention and acclaim for directing the over-hyped blockbuster 'Spider-Man'. That movie has introduced him to mainstream filmgoers, no bad thing in itself, but to many of us Raimi is already a legend, because he created 'The Evil Dead', without a doubt one of the greatest horror movies of all time. Made on a shoe string budget as a labour of love, it still remains Raimi's best movie. He has subsequently worked on bigger projects with bigger names but it is arguable whether he has ever surpassed the invention, thrills, energy and sheer fun of this. And why Bruce Campbell never became a genuine movie star after his debut here, and not just a much loved cult figure, is a complete mystery to me. 'The Evil Dead' is a modern horror classic and absolutely ESSENTIAL viewing for any self-respecting movie buff! It doesn't get much better than this!",Null,86,122,8 July 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino's stylish and exciting encyclopedia of trash culture is pure entertainment! A purely visual, visceral super cool popcorn movie.
","I've just been to see 'Kill Bill'. Please excuse me if I find it a bit difficult to get my thoughts together, cos I'm still taking my jaw off the floor! First thing is I've been a fan of Tarantino since I saw 'Reservoir Dogs' ten years ago. I'm not a teenage fanboy who thinks QT is God. I'm a cynical old geezer who has seen a few movies in my time. If 'Kill Bill' sucked I would be the first to shout it from the rooftops. But it doesn't suck. It's easily the most entertaining action movie I've seen since... well, I can't even think of anything to compare it to. And yes, this is an ACTION movie, so if you're expecting depth to the characters, and any kind of insight into the human condition, you're out of luck. Tarantino showed in 'Jackie Brown' that he can do that. This time round he's come up with a purely visual, visceral popcorn movie. I usually despise most modern examples of that. All those cynically packaged and carefully marketed CGI-infested 'blockbusters'. The main reason I enjoyed 'Kill Bill' so much is that it was blatantly obvious that Tarantino has made this movie to please nobody but himself. That's why it really works for me. He doesn't give a damn whether you like it or not, he's just making a movie he thinks is super cool. Thankfully I agree with him! It's jam-packed with pop-culture references, and echoes of movies past and present - obvious ones, obscure ones, from 70s chop socky classics through to the outrageous genre-busting of Takashi Miike ('Dead Or Alive', 'Ichi The Killer', 'City Of Lost Souls',etc.) via spaghetti westerns and Peckinpah's 'The Killer Elite'. The soundtrack is mind-bogglingly eclectic and ranges from Nancy Sinatra to Morricone to Isaac Hayes to Krautrock legends Neu! to '60s one-hit-wonders The Human Beinz, plus some rockin' live numbers from Japanese girl band The 5.6.7.8.'s. There's Bruce Lee in-jokes and nods to 'Battle Royale' (one of the stars of the latter Chiaki Kuriyama is featured in the most exciting fight scene here), and a cameo from Sonny Chiba, and even - get this! - a homage to the hilarious martial arts cult classic 'The One Armed Boxer vs. The Flying Guillotine'. But look, you don't have to get all the references and recognize Tarantino's sources of inspiration to enjoy 'Kill Bill'. The more you know the more you'll get out of it, but even a novice will find plenty to entertain them. To say I eagerly await Volume 2 of 'Kill Bill' is the understatement of the decade!!",Null,1,2,7 November 2003
From Dusk Till Dawn," Enormously enjoyable trash classic!
","'From Dusk Til Dawn' is one of the very few recent movies that can hold its head up high with the very best exploitation movies of the 60s and 70s. Think AIP. Think Roger Corman, Jack Hill, Lucio Fulci, Larry Cohen, William Lustig. If any of those names mean anything to you then this movie is absolutely essential viewing! Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, hot off the successes of 'Desperado' and 'Pulp Fiction' respectively, found themselves of being in the enviable position of being able to take Tarantino's early script intended for a low budget b-grade horror/exploitation movie, and being able to make it with a lot more money than originally envisioned, and with their dream cast of characters actors and cult favourites. They obviously relished this once in a lifetime opportunity, and really took all the way, ending up with one of the most enjoyable and entertaining movies in years. George Clooney, a household name via 'E.R', but let's face it, a  veteran of many awful and forgettable TV shows and movies, is a revelation here in a star making lead role as Seth Gecko. Tarantino himself gives his most convincing acting performance to date as his psychotic brother Richard. Harvey Keitel gives first class support as a vacationing ex-priest who unfortunately crosses their path. Juliette Lewis plays Keitel's daughter in a slightly underwritten role that only has a few standout scenes. The rest of the cast is outstanding and includes everyone from Cheech Marin ('Up In Smoke') to Tom Savini ('Dawn Of The Dead'), Michael Parks ('Then Came Bronson'), to Fred Williamson ('Black Caesar'), John Saxon ('Enter The Dragon') to Danny Trejo ('Heat'), as well as mega-babe and Rodriguez regular Salma Hayek in an unforgettable sequence as Santanico Pandemonium. This is the ultimate beer and pizza movie and on that level is difficult to fault. A highly recommended fun filled modern trash classic!",Null,1,2,1 December 2002
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Awful songs drag down this mediocre musical.
","I love music and I love movies but I very rarely enjoy any mixing of the two. I can count on one hand the amount of musicals I can tolerate, let alone enjoy, so you can take my reaction to this overrated  and tedious 'post-punk neo-glam rock musical' with a pinch of salt if you like, I don't care. An obvious attempt to jump on the 'Rocky Horror' bandwagon (another movie that bores me stupid), 'Hedwig And The Angry Inch' gives lots of lip service to two of my favourite performers Iggy Pop and Lou Reed, but I honestly could hear very little of their influence on the mostly awful songs in this movie. One number which I can't recall the title of had a Richard Hell feel to it and that one was okay, but the rest of them stink. As this is a musical, and the songs also tell most of the story, if you don't like them then there's very little else to keep your attention. I'm sorry, but I got absolutely nothing out of watching this movie, and have no plans of ever sitting through it again. Life is too short and there are two many great movies out there to watch instead of wasting time with mediocrities like this. And if you want to hear some genuinely entertaining transsexual rock'n'roll dig up some old records by Wayne/Jayne County, at least they actually ROCK.",Null,2,6,4 December 2002
This Is Spinal Tap," Still the funniest rock'n'roll movie ever, and one of the best DVDs on the market.
","'This Is Spinal Tap' has been part of my life for so many years that it's hard to remember a time when I hadn't seen it. Having recently bought it on DVD and rewatched it for the nth time I was once again struck and just how clever and amusing this movie is. Christopher Guest and friends are not only very talented comedians with an amazing ability to improvise, but they know their music, and this is the real strength of the movie. Even though I have almost memorized every scene and joke it's STILL funny to me no matter how many times I watch it. Not only is the movie itself a classic, but the DVD is one of the best buys around with plenty of extras, deleted scenes, many as good as those chosen, and best of all a hilarious commentary by Tufnel, St Hubbins and Smalls which is even funnier than the movie itself. In fact it's the most entertaining DVD commentary track I've heard to date. This movie is a comedy classic, and easily the sharpest rock'n'roll parody ever made. If you haven't seen it before you're in for a treat! Absolutely essential viewing for all rock'n'roll fans, metal or otherwise!",Null,130,150,9 October 2002
A Clockwork Orange," Beethoven, black humour, sex, violence, they don't make 'em like this anymore! A movie milestone that still packs a punch.
","Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' is one movie that is talked about more than it is watched, especially in Britain where it was banned for many years. One of the most notorious and controversial movies of the 1970s (a decade which also gave us such notorious and controversial movies as  'Taxi Driver', 'Salo', 'Straw Dogs', 'Last Tango In Paris', 'In The Realm Of The Senses' and 'Last House On The Left') it still packs a punch today. Don't just watch it because of its reputation. watch it because its a damn good movie. Kubrick was on top of his form here, and in my mind it ranks with 'Dr Strangelove' and 'The Killing' as his most successful work. Purists may whine about the changes to Anthony Burgess novel, which is indisputably a modern classic, but I think Kubrick's adaptation is as good as can be expected for the era in which it was made and the constraints of cinema (even now). Malcolm McDowell is superb as Alex, a brilliant performance which he will always be remembered by. In some scenes I was reminded of his Mick from Lindsay Anderson's 'If..'. While the two movies have no real connection it's interesting to compare McDowell's performances. The rest of the cast are also very good, especially Alex's droogs (actors largely unknown outside Britain), and cult favourite Patrick Magee ('Masque Of The Red Death') in a pivotal supporting role. I also got a kick out of Aubrey Morris' Deltoid. Morris is an interesting character most familiar to me for appearing in 'The Wicker Man' and trash classic 'Lifeforce'. 'A Clockwork Orange is a movie milestone that is as great now as it ever was. I have watched in many times and it never fails to deliver. One of the very best movies of the 1970s, which means it is one of the very best movies ever made. Highly recommended viewing.",Null,11,18,20 February 2003
From Hell," From Hell - where the script came from?
","Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's brilliant graphic novel 'From Hell' is one of the most original and intelligent works of fiction in recent years, and something I cannot recommend highly enough. Please don't let this useless film adaptation put you off the superb original. 'From Hell' the movie is simply awful. The basic thing which sinks it from the outset is a lousy, illogical script that seems to totally miss everything that made Moore's work so enthralling. All the original and thought provoking elements are thrown out, and the bare bones of the plot are recast as a tired, cliched murder mystery, which holds no surprises or suspense, and which, let's face it was done much more convincingly in 'Murder By Decree' back in the 1970s. Johnny Depp is badly miscast as the middle aged Inspector Abberline, his accent is very shaky, and his drug use and clairvoyant visions are bogus and unnecessarily tacked on. The rest of the cast struggles with the poor material. Heather Graham is also a strange casting choice and not very convincing. Robbie Coltrane is reasonable. Ian Holm is well chosen but his character is a major disappointment. And so it goes, on and on. I liked The Hughes brothers underrated 'Dead Presidents', and enjoyed their documentary 'American Pimp'. I think they've got more good movies in them, but this isn't one. No matter how talented they are with a script as bad as this one there's very little that can be done to rescue this misguided and embarrassing project.",Null,7,13,24 July 2002
Reservoir Dogs," Ten years on - still brilliant!
","It's hard to get your head around the fact that 'Reservoir Dogs' has been around for ten years. It's almost difficult to remember a time before Tarantino made such an enormous impact (good and bad) on movies, but I saw this movie first time round before the hype. All I knew was that, like another 'dog' movie from the same era that I saw, 'Man Bites Dog', that it was supposed to be violent, funny and disturbing, and that it starred a long time favourite of mine Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth, who I mainly knew from Greenaway's 'The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover'. Okay, I hope it's good I thought as I waited in the cinema listening to some half remembered 70s A.M. pop and a strange conversation about Madonna's sex life (the cinema was playing the soundtrack album before the main feature, but what did we know). Then the movie itself, electrifying and fascinating from the word go. It's impossible to describe the impact of seeing this for the first time without knowing what to expect! Still one of my greatest movie memories. Ten years later I've seen it countless times so the surprise has obviously worn off, but it is still a brilliant movie because beneath the violence and wise-cracks of Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi - 'In The Soup'), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen - 'Thelma & Louise'), and Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn - 'At Close Range'), there is a lot of  depth, that being the very human relationship between Mr. White (Keitel) and Mr.Orange (Roth). To me that is one of the things that elevates this above the many lame and unoriginal 'Tarantinoesque' movies we've had to endure since 'Pulp Fiction'. His imitators just simply don't have a clue!Simply brilliant cinema, and a modern classic. This is absolutely essential viewing!",Null,113,174,5 June 2002
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," And the point is??
","'Salo' is quite possibly the most controversial movie ever made. Mainly because people are divided on Pasolini's motivation for making it. Passionate anti-fascist propaganda as he claimed? Or sick, pedophilic sensationalism, as his critics accuse? Maybe somewhere in between? I really can't decide. 'Salo' is banned where I live so it has taken me a long time to actually get to see it. Now that I have I can't really say whether I'm 'happy' I did or not. This is a movie that explicitly portrays many vile and disgusting acts of sex and torture. Paradoxically it is also very boring. I have tried to read De Sade's novel which inspired this movie ('The 120 Days Of Sodom') and found it to be much the same thing - repellent, highly repetitive, and completely dull. A difficult read for several reasons. So you could say that Pasolini has managed to be very faithful to the book in that sense. This is ultimately a very boring movie, and most people will find it a chore to finish. How do you rate a movie like this? How can you judge whether it was successful or not when you can't tell exactly what it was trying to achieve? I have no answers. 'Salo' is at the very least a unique movie experience. Ban it? No. Recommend it? No, not that either.",Null,5,13,17 June 2002
Pulp Fiction," A masterpiece! Did you really expect me to say anything else?
","Today I just heard about the death of Dee Dee Ramone, and after getting over the initial shock, it made me think about 'Pulp Fiction'. This ground breaking movie, much like the ground breaking music of the Ramones, has been endlessly discussed, praised, damned, ripped off and copied so many times that you can easily lose sight of the fact that what you have here is a genuinely original, exciting and important work of art that when experienced for the umpteenth time STILL never fails to thrill and amuse. The many talentless punk bands who have recycled watered down and witless imitations of Da Brudders music haven't made 'Rocket To Russia' any less brilliant, only more so. The same thing goes with Quentin Tarantino's countless less talented followers. They just make you appreciate 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' even more.This movie is one of the few I would describe as perfect. I honestly cannot fault a thing about it. The brilliant dialogue has become legendary, the elliptical structure of the script (though influenced by Kubrick's 'The Killing', and the experiments of the French New Wave) has been much imitated and will continue to do so, the fantastic group of actors, who range from has-beens (at the time) to cult favourites, are all uniformly excellent, and the soundtrack is one of the coolest and most eclectic ever assembled. In short, this is a modern classic, and required viewing for all movie buffs, especially 70s nuts like myself. 'Pulp Fiction' is as good as any movie you care to name. To (mis)quote Flavor Flav - 'believe the hype!'",Null,6,12,6 June 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," One of the poorest sequels in recent memory! Absolutely terrible, and DULL DULL DULL.
","I enjoyed 'The Matrix' enough to buy it, but while I thought it was an entertaining action movie, I didn't buy the ridiculous hype surrounding it. I'm much too familiar with Philip K. Dick, Robert Anton Wilson, Grant Morrison's mind-blowing comics 'The Invisibles' and the other source material that inspired it to think that the Wachowski brothers are innovative thinkers. Now I'd avoided 'The Matrix Reloaded' until now because I'd been warned that it was a major disappointment, but I finally relented and watched it... Boy, BIG MISTAKE! I could never have guessed how terrible this was going to be. Easily the poorest sequel in recent memory. I can't think of ONE thing I liked about it. The three main characters from the original bored the crap out of me, all the new ones introduced were even LESS interesting, and the whole Zion thing, well, I couldn't care less what happened to these people. On top of that you have some of the most stilted and nonsensical dialogue you'll ever hear and I'm sick of saying this but it's true - CGI SUCKS! The two 'big' set pieces, the car chase and the fight with multiple Agent Smiths, were just SO boring to me... If you want to see REAL excitement just compare the latter sequence to the Crazy 88 fight in 'Kill Bill'. I'm sorry I thought 'The Matrix Reloaded' was AWFUL. As I said, I think the first movie was overrated but it was still entertaining, and at least it had some ENERGY. But this! I had to force myself to sit through it until the end. DULL DULL DULL!",Null,0,2,18 November 2003
Psycho," A modern suspense classic and one of the most influential movies of all time.
","'Psycho' is one of the most famous and talked about suspense movies ever made. In fact it has been copied, ripped off and parodied so many times it's often easy to underrate it, but every time I watch it it really works for me. No matter how many times you view it you will notice something new, some shot or bit of business that impresses. Of course there's hardly a movie fan on the planet who doesn't know the major twists in the plot (like the original 'Planet Of The Apes' even people who have never seen it know what's going to happen), but that doesn't really matter, there's more than enough going on here to enjoy. Hitchcock's direction is masterful, and the movie has been hugely influential. Not just obvious films like William Castle's 'Homicidal' or Brian De Palma's 'Sisters' (and let's not even mention Gus Van Sant's misguided remake of some years back!), but Italian giallo and the whole slasher sub-genre wouldn't be the same without 'Psycho'. Even film makers outside the horror/suspense field have been influenced by it, Quentin Tarantino for example. One very famous shot in 'Psycho' is deliberately quoted in 'Pulp Fiction'. The cast of 'Psycho' are all very good, particularly Janet Leigh ('Touch Of Evil') and Vera Miles ('The Searchers') as the Crane sisters, and Martin Balsam ('Cape Fear') as Detective Arbogast. The real stand out performance is by the late Anthony Perkins ('The Trial') as Norman Bates. He is absolutely superb and surely deserved an Oscar. 'Psycho' is one of THE great American movies and should be watched and enjoyed by any movie fan. Hitchcock made many outstanding films, but 'Psycho' must rank with the best of them. A classic movie that has stood the test of time, I don't doubt that it will influence generations of film makers to come.",Null,2,3,6 March 2003
Halloween," Maybe not the first slasher movie, but still one of the best, and most influential.
","I'll leave it to horror historians to debate what is the first real slasher movie as we know it. Many people give Mario Bava credit for inventing the genre with 'Bay Of Blood' (a.k.a. 'Twitch Of The Death Nerve'). Certainly the giallo genre as a whole must be mentioned that is a fact, but whether or not 'Halloween' was the first slasher movie it is undoubtedly one of the best, and definitely one of the most influential. John Carpenter was on one hell of a roll at this time, having made the amusing sci fi spoof 'Dark Star', and the underrated siege classic 'Assault On Precinct 13'. 'Halloween' is another goodie from Carpenter, a director who sadly seems to have his best work behind him. Like his previous two features Carpenter also composed the score, and his simple but effective music (influenced greatly I'd say by Goblin) really helps increase the tension. British horror favourite Donald Pleasence ('Fantastic Voyage') is given top billing as Dr Sam Loomis (a 'Psycho' in-joke), but the real star of the movie is Jamie Lee Curtis, in a breakout role that made her a much loved figure for horror buffs. Curtis' teenage pals, played by P.J. Soles ('Rock'n'Roll High School') and Nancy Loomis (who had a bit part in 'Assault On Precinct 13'), are also impressive, and the chemistry between them is convincing and realistic. Also keep an eye out for Charles Cyphers, an early Carpenter regular who unfortunately is little seen in movies these days. 'Halloween' is a very tight and creepy thriller full of atmosphere and suspense. Forget the many inferior sequels, and the dozens of crappy slasher movies that subsequently imitated it, it is still a brilliant horror movie that every fan should cherish. If for some strange reason you haven't seen this one, do so immediately!",Null,0,2,3 February 2003
Carrie," A terrific De Palma thriller that is still one of the most satisfying Stephen King adaptations.
","Brian De Palma is unfairly dismissed by many people as 'the Hitchcock guy', something which ignores the variety of his output from the zany rock musical 'Phantom Of The Paradise' to the flamboyant gangster classic 'Scarface'. 'Carrie' has a few Hitchcock touches to be sure (mainly in the score which mimics 'Psycho'), but nowhere near as much as 'Sisters' or 'Dressed To Kill'. In several sequences I was more reminded of Dario Argento, but 'Carrie' has a stronger narrative than most of Argento's work. One thing that struck me on re-watching this (for the umpteenth time) is that like Argento, De Palma is often regarded as a cold director more interested in visuals and fancy shots than acting, but the main thing that makes 'Carrie' work is the terrific performance he managed to coax out of Sissy Spacek. Spacek had already given an impressive turn in 'Badlands' a few years earlier but this role is what really launched her career. It also did a lot of good for Stephen King! I would say that 'Carrie' ties with Kubrick's 'The Shining' and Cronenberg's 'The Dead Zone' as the most satisfying King adaptations to date. While Spacek all but steals the movie Piper Laurie is also very good as Carrie's fanatical Mom, in an over the top performance which for me really works. The cast is full of young actors many unknowns who went on to greater success, like Travolta and Nancy Allen (interestingly enough later teamed up by De Palma in his underrated 'Blow Out'), Amy Irving and P.J. Soles, who appeared in another influential 70s horror classic 'Halloween' not long after this. I also enjoyed seeing the great character actor Sydney Lassick in a supporting role as a sarcastic teacher. Lassick played Charlie Cheswick in 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' and I always get a kick out of seeing him on screen. (Sadly he died last year with little fanfare). De Palma is still one of the most underrated 'name' Hollywood directors. His movies have been pretty disappointing for the last ten years or so, but when he was good he was REALLY good, and 'Carrie' is testament to that.",Null,1,2,20 January 2004
Blow," 'Blow' doesn't suck, but it could be SO much better!
","I feel bad criticizing 'Blow' because it at least ATTEMPTS to make an interesting, adult movie, which is sadly a rarity these days. But I must be honest, and it really doesn't cut it. I seem to spend half my life defending Johnny Depp, but even I must concede that he isn't any great shakes as an actor. The guy has about two modes, and plays variations thereof in all his movies. Basically, I didn't believe him as this character. Nothing new there. I also think it's a fine line between homage and rip-off, and this movie leans too much towards the latter for my liking. I'm talking specifically about Scorcese, generally about 'Goodfellas'. Is the voice-over and having Ray Liotta in the cast, a clever reference or lazy, second hand writing/direction? I wish it was the former.Actually Liotta is one of the best things about this movie. His character is well rounded and interesting. I wish I could say the same about the three major female roles (Griffiths, Potente, Cruz). 'Blow' features some great, interesting character actors - Max Perlich, Chris Curtis, Paul Reubens, Kevin Gage, Miguel Sandoval. They are really the only reason to watch this.

","First thing is I must admit to not having seen 'Abre Los Ojos', so I can't comment on how much of this is a straightforward remake, or whether any of it is different or original . 'Vanilla Sky' begins as a murder mystery, but that is just a ruse, it is in fact more Phildickian than Hitchcockian. Any fan of PKD's mind-blowing work, specifically 'Ubik', 'A Maze Of Death' and 'Flow My Tears The Policeman Said', bits of which 'Vanilla Sky' share some similarities to, will feel more at home with this kind of material than 'Jerry Maguire' fans. I have two major problems with 'Vanilla Sky', and both of them I blame on Cameron Crowe, a director who fails to set my world on fire. Apart from the flawed but entertaining 'Almost Famous' I haven't liked much of his output, which to me is basically commercial pap. With this movie he is obviously trying to expand his range, and succeeds to a certain degree, but still doesn't entirely pull it off. My first problem is Crowe's direction which is disjointed, clumsy and ultimately turns potentially fascinating material into a bore. My other problem was the distracting and ridiculous use of music. It was almost like Crowe went through his record collection and insisted on putting in his favourite bits, regardless of whether it made any cinematic sense or not. Maybe he was going for a similar eclectic feel that the Coen's achieved in 'The Big Lebowski', more than likely, looking at the subject matter, it was trying to be a comment on pop culture and the media ala Trent Reznor's superb musical collage in 'Natural Born Killers'. Whatever the motivation it fell flat on its face, and almost single handedly ruined this movie for me.Ultimately 'Vanilla Sky' is neither a masterpiece, nor a complete turkey. Crowe is no Kubrick, Cronenberg or Lynch, and this kind of concept needs someone of that vision and creative originality to truly soar. It is interesting in places, irritating in others, and dull for too much of the time. Nice try, worth a look for sure, just don't have high expectations. This year's 'The Matrix', but not as good.",Null,19,40,2 January 2002
Blade Runner," A fascinating and visually stunning film. Still one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made!
","Having been a major fan of the late Philip K. Dick since before this movie was made, I initially had some problems with the movie leaving out some of the major parts of Dick's novel 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?', most notably the total absence of Rick Deckard's wife, and the removal of the sub-plot involving Mercerism. But I have long come to terms with that and now can happily judge 'Blade Runner' as a movie in its own right, without comparing it to the brilliant novel that inspired it. As a movie, 'Blade Runner' is a stunning achievement, and to me it is still one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made. Ridley Scott is a very visually orientated director, and is often only as good as the script he is working with. In this case he was blessed with a very good one, co-written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples (the latter went on to co-write another modern SF classic 'Twelve Monkeys'). Scott and his team manage to conjure up one of the most impressive cityscapes of the future ever seen in a science fiction film.  So impressive that it knocked the socks off William Gibson, the writer who is credited with 'inventing' virtual reality. 'Blade Runner's look had a definite influence on Gibson's seminal 'Neuromancer', and the movie must therefore be seen as a major contribution to the cyberpunk genre, which is still making waves in pop culture, just look at 'The Matrix' for one. Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as the weary and cynical Deckard, and the supporting ensemble cast are all excellent. Many of these actors (especially Rutger Hauer, cult favourite Brion James, Daryl Hannah) would rarely be given roles as good as this again. Hauer is particularly good in one of his best ever performances, which gives Blatty a depth and humanity not even seen in Dick's original story. Legendary character actor M. Emmet Walsh ('Blood Simple') and Joe Turkel, veteran of three Kubrick movies (one of only two actors to have that honor) are also worth noting, as is the superb score by Greek electronics whizz Vangelis. 'Blade Runner' is a science fiction classic, and a movie which improves with each viewing. Highly recommended, but make sure steer clear of the version originally released in cinemas with the cheesy voice over. The (so-called) Director's Cut is the only one to see.",Null,0,0,6 February 2003
The Matrix," Eye candy, not brain food.
","I have mixed feeling about 'The Matrix'. As a long time science fiction fan I saw this on its original cinematic run and was completely entertained. A great popcorn movie. And while it really demands to be seen on the Big Screen to be fully appreciated, I bought a copy for my own collection, and have watched it several times since and have always enjoyed it. Fine, great so far.  But the problems for me begin when fanatical fans of the movie make WAY too many claims for it. This is an ACTION movie folks, nothing more, nothing less. It surrounds the Woo/Lam inspired action with MTV-friendly simplified ideas lifted from Grant Morrison's sensational comics 'The Invisibles', and from Morrison's source materials - the paranoid, reality bending, Gnostic influenced SF of Philip K. Dick, the mankind-as-aliens-property ideas of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and the techno-shamanism and multiple realities of Robert Anton Wilson and Terrence McKenna.
Unfortunately very few 'Matrix' buffs seem to be aware of the writers and thinkers the Wachowski brothers are basing their supposedly 'amazing' concepts from, and are over rating the movie to a ridiculous degree. Enjoy 'The Matrix' for what it is, but don't believe the hype!",Null,3,9,12 December 2001
Cube," Easily the best science fiction movie of the 1990s!
","'Cube' is the perfect example of why mega-budgets and special effects are NOT what is important about science fiction movies. Ideas are. A simple thing, but something the hordes of 'Phantom Menace' and 'Fellowship Of The Ring' fans fail to grasp. More fools them.'Cube' is low budget fantastic cinema at it's best. Comparable in achievement to 'Carnival Of Souls', 'Night Of The Living Dead', 'Dark Star' and 'Eraserhead'. 'Cube' is literally a puzzle, and 'the answer' is whatever each viewer makes it. Movie-goers who prefer to be spoon-fed will find it frustrating, those that like to think for themselves will be delighted. This movie has more in common with Kafka and Abe than 'Star Trek'. If you think that's pretentious then 'Cube' probably isn't the movie for you. Otherwise, do not miss seeing this movie! A future classic.",Null,1,3,20 January 2002
Jackie Brown," Tarantino's sleeper. An underrated gem of a movie.
","Many people were disappointed with 'Jackie Brown' when it was first released as it didn't live up to their expectations created by the more flamboyant 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I admit that I was one of those disappointed fans. But as the years have gone by I have come to appreciate this movie more and more, and if you deal with what it IS and not what you thought it was going to be, you'll see that it is an underrated gem of a movie. 'Jackie Brown' is much more character driven and leisurely plotted than Tarantino's previous two movies. I haven't read the Elmore Leonard novel on which it was based so I can't tell whether this was a conscious decision by Tarantino himself, or it's because of the source material, but it might be a stumbling block for those with MTV-style attention spans. 1970s crime movie buffs will find it much easier going. The big names in the cast like De Niro, Jackson and Fonda are all very good, but the real standout performances in this movie are by 70s blaxploitation icon Pam Grier ('Coffy', 'Foxy Brown', 'Black Mama White Mama',etc.etc.) and a revelatory one from Robert Forster. Forster back in the day showed plenty of promise in movies like 'Medium Cool' but quickly found himself stuck in b-grade exploitation movies like 'Vigilante' and 'Alligator'. Fun stuff, but hardly Oscar material. Max Cherry is the best role he has ever been given, and he is superb in it. The fascinating thing about 'Jackie Brown' for me is that Tarantino's critics accuse him of making shallow and violent self-consciously hip crime films, but the central story of this movie concerns an inter-racial Middle Aged romance, something I haven't seen done in a believable or realistic fashion by Hollywood before. By doing this so well Tarantino shows he has much more depth, and is a much more interesting and braver film maker than his more acclaimed contemporaries. 'Jackie Brown' is a fine movie that hopefully one day will get the kudos it deserves. Don't overlook this one just because it isn't 'Pulp Fiction The Next Generation'!",Null,357,404,24 October 2002
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," I used to think this was the funniest movie ever made.
","Being brought up on Python going to see this movie on its original release was one of the highlights of my movie going childhood. For many years I thought 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' was the funniest movie ever made. Now over twenty five years later repetition and familiarity may not have ruined the movie completely but they have spoiled my enjoyment somewhat. Even so it's still a comedy classic and I envy anyone who is watching it for the first time. Python (Cleese, Chapman, Palin, Jones, Idle and Gilliam) were on top form throughout, and apart from one or two less successful bits it's hilarious stuff, and arguably their most consistent movie. (I still think their TV work was their best, the non-linear sketch format suiting their style more than extended pieces). Python bores can quote this verbatim but don't let them put you off. This is one wacked out romp full of fun and surprises, and still has more laughs than 90% of today's so-called comedies. Highly recommended.",Null,19,25,25 March 2003
Saboteur," It may not be top shelf Hitchcock but 'Saboteur' is still a very entertaining thriller.
","'Saboteur' isn't one of Hitchcock's best known movies but it shouldn't be completely dismissed for that reason. It's a very entertaining 'innocent man on the run' thriller, a theme he had previously used to great success in 'The 39 Steps', and would later recycle in one of his most popular movies 'North By Northwest' (and one which still gets used time and time again by Hollywood - see 'The Fugitive', 'Enemy Of The State', 'Minority Report' and countless others).  Some people slam Robert Cummings (who later appeared in Hitchcock's 'Dial M For Murder') as being a bit lightweight, but I think he's actually pretty good as a leading man, and Priscilla Lane ('Arsenic And Old Lace') is also not bad, and the two do show some on screen chemistry. Of course with more charismatic leads 'Saboteur' would have been greatly improved, but as it is it's good enough. One actor in the cast I think is really terrific is Otto Kruger ('Murder, My Sweet') who plays Tobin, one of Hitchcock's best ever villains. 'Saboteur' is action packed and keeps things interesting. There's a good sequence with a traveling circus, memorable bit parts from a truck driver and a blind man, and the climax is great stuff and vintage Hitch. If you are new to Hitchcock I could name at least a dozen of his movies to watch before this one, but if you've seen his 'greatest hits' try 'Saboteur', it's lots of fun.",Null,29,34,17 August 2003
True Romance," Tony Scott vs Quentin Tarantino. The winner? Us!
","Cynical, seen-it-all-before smart ass that I am, I can't but help love 'True Romance'! On paper it looks like a sure fire recipe for disaster. A typically hip pop-culture saturated Quentin Tarantino script directed by schlockmeister Tony Scott, the man responsible for rancid Simpson/Bruckheimer 'blockbusters' like 'Top Gun' and 'Days Of Thunder'. But some how it really works! The movie is especially helped by a dynamite cast, one of the most impressive in many years. Possibly only Julian Schnabel's underrated biopic 'Basquiat' can rival its mixture of star power and cult faves. Slater, Arquette, Walken, Hopper, Oldman, Kilmer, Penn, Sizemore, Jackson, Rapaport, Gandolfini, Argo, Corrigan, etc.etc. These are many of the finest actors working today. Add them to an electric story of love on the run, jam packed with amusing, highly quotable dialogue and plenty of action and laughs, and you have yourself a genuinely entertaining update of a classic 70s drive-in movie. 'True Romance' is a wild ride not to be missed!",Null,114,155,4 June 2002
Donnie Darko," Very interesting debut from writer/director Richard Kelly. Watch this guy!
","I'd heard a lot about 'Donnie Darko' for a long time before I got to see it (it has only just been given a belated cinema release here in Australia for some reason that's difficult to fathom), and it seemed like something I'd flip out over. However I can't say it quite lived up to the hype, and I expected a bit more than it delivered. Even with a few qualms it's still an extremely interesting debut from writer/director Richard Kelly, a guy I now have a lot of confidence in. I hope he manages to live up to the potential 'Donnie Darko' exhibits. Jake Gyllenhaal, previously unknown to me, is excellent in the title role, and heads up a largely obscure cast who are all also fine. There are one or two familiar faces along for the ride. Drew Barrymore, who is also one of the executive producers, didn't do very much for me as one of Donnie's feisty teachers, Patrick Swayze was adequate as a shallow self help guru, and Katherine Ross, who I can hardly remember seeing in anything of note since 'The Stepford Wives', is even better as Donnie's concerned but clueless therapist. I also got a kick out of seeing Gregg Araki favourite James Duval in the bizarre but memorable role of Frank. The scenes between Frank and Donnie being the high points of the movie, and almost worthy of David Lynch at his finest (Lynch being an obvious reference point for the movie as a whole). I advise anyone who has yet to see this to avoid all descriptions of the plot as the less you know about this movie the more enjoyable and surprising it will be. I don't consider it to be a great movie but it is a very good one, which is a lot more than I can say for 90% of Hollywood's output these days. Flawed but fascinating, 'Donnie Darko' is a movie definitely worth making an effort to catch. And keep your eye on Richard Kelly. I eagerly look forward to his next project!",Null,1,3,30 November 2002
Goodfellas," Simply a masterpiece. Scorsese's last truly great movie (to date).
","'Goodfellas' is a masterpiece, pure and simple. While not my favourite Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best movies. The film is stunning technically. The consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography, editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it's all breathtaking. But Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is the best he's ever been, and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the 'stars'. (Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but looks cool!). 'Goodfellas' is (to date) Scorsese's last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!",Null,143,251,17 March 2003
Beetlejuice," Burton's true masterpiece, and one of the ten best 80s movies.
","Watching this one more time on TV yesterday reminded me of the first time I saw it all those years ago at the movies when Tim Burton was just the guy who had directed that funny Pee-wee Herman movie. Walking into 'Beetlejuice' then, without knowing anything about it, was an amazing experience. Along with 'Blade Runner', 'Blue Velvet', 'Videodrome', 'Brazil', 'Paris, Texas', 'The Terminator' and 'Repo Man' it was one of the most astonishing and memorable  movies of the 1980s, an era dominated by Hollywood dreck like 'Flashdance', 'Top Gun', and 'Footloose'. The whole Bruckheimer/Simpson/Spielberg/Hughes zeitgeist that dumbed down popular movies as never before. Movies like 'Beetlejuice' were a glimmer of hope in a truly awful period.The big question is - how does it stand up today? The answer is better than ever! In fact I would argue that 'Beetlejuice' is Tim Burton's most successful and least compromised film. Everything about it is perfect. A great cast lead by the very appealing and likable Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as the newly dead Maitlands, a star turn by Michael Keaton as the gonzo 'bio-exorcist' title character, and strong support from Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and especially Winona Ryder (a performance that really put her on the map), as the new occupants of the Maitlands house. 'Beetlejuice' juggles gruesome, trippy and genuinely witty sequences, and ends up becoming one of the freshest and surreal movies to find a mainstream audience since the heyday of 60s/70s 'head' movies. Forget Burton's more recent hit and miss big budget efforts, and try this for the real deal, Luis Bunuel meets Tex Avery meets George Romero, and then some! 'Beetlejuice' is a blast!",Null,104,139,7 December 2001
Evil Dead II," A profoundly disappointing 'sequel' to one of my all time favourite horror movies.
","'The Evil Dead' is one of my all time favourite horror movies. It's a classic example of what can be achieved on a very low budget if you have ideas and enthusiasm, and twenty years after it was released it holds up very well. The first movie was lot of fun without being deliberately FUNNY. Things aren't the same in 'Evil Dead 2', which is basically a remake trying to pass itself off as a sequel. The tone is very different this time around. The subtle black humour of the original has been replaced by blatant self-parody, and Three Stooges inspired slapstick. Many people absolutely love this approach and regard this as the best in the series. Well I'm sorry I'm not one of them. I think Bruce Campbell is cool too, but this movie is just an excuse for Ash to mug at the camera and throw out cheesy one liners. I wouldn't mind so much if the results were actually funny, but they're not, just silly. There's no suspense or unease in 'Evil Dead 2', something I really admired about the original, and to me, the supposedly more sophisticated special effects aren't half as effective. I don't hate this movie, I'm just profoundly disappointed by it. I can't see any reason to prolong this slamming. You either like this kind of splatter comedy or you don't. If you do it's probably essential viewing, but if you're like me and prefer horror more than comedy then you might be in for a tedious experience. My lack of enthusiasm for 'Evil Dead 2' doesn't spoil my enjoyment of 'The Evil Dead'. That movie is still a horror classic and I recommend it to everyone.",Null,2,4,12 June 2004
High Fidelity," A great book turned into a mediocre movie.
","Nick Hornby's novel 'High Fidelity' is funny, wise and much more complex than it first appears on the surface. Unfortunately Stephen Frears' movie adaptation almost completely misses the whole point. Frears, Cusack and co end up with an occasionally amusing romantic comedy with music as the 'colour' or 'background', rather than it being the cornerstone of the movie. Transferring the setting from the UK to the US is one thing, but to mess around with the clearly defined characters and musical tastes of Rob, Dick and Barry in such a way as to make them almost meaningless just shows how little of the book was really understood. Music is the most important thing in the world to these guys, sometimes more than relationships. Good or bad, that's the way it is. The book knows this, the movie does not. As a musical obsessive myself I could relate to the book. From this mediocre effort it seems Cusack and his three(!) co-writers did not. A major disappointment.",Null,0,2,11 May 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The most accessible and enjoyable Coen brothers movie to date
","I have yet to see a Coen brothers movie I didn't like, but I can see how some of their work can be a little too esoteric for some (e.g. the wonderfully strange 'Barton Fink'). 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' however, is their most accessible and downright entertaining movie to date, and should appeal to a wide range of viewers. A typically eccentric Coen premise - Homer retold as a Depression musical comedy - it manages to be consistently funny and warm without losing any of their trademark quirks and wit. George Clooney steals the show with one of his  best performances (equal to 'Three Kings' in my opinion), and is wonderfully backed up by Coen regular John Turturro ('Do The Right Thing') and relative new comer Tim Blake Nelson. The three make a classic comedy team ala The Three Stooges. The rest of the first rate supporting cast includes many familiar faces from previous Coen films (John Goodman, Holly Hunter, etc) as well as the underrated Daniel von Bargen ('Lord Of Illusions, 'Desert Blue') and 'Wild At Heart' weirdo Frank Collison. This movie is a joy from start to finish. I loved it and would recommend it to anybody who is looking for a genuinely funny and clever comedy.",Null,2,3,11 July 2002
