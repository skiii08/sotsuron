The Avengers," greatest fight scenes ever--true joy
","OK, if you don't get it yet, Josh BY GOSH has totally hooked us up! From the very beginning, this film grabs your attention and never lets go. Gods(?) from other dimensions aggravate the wildest earthling freaks available... luckily amazingly powerful lads and some just good human's with weapon's (Widow and Hawkeye). Hulk rules as usual. Thor vs iron man--very cool throw in cap--nice. Thor vs Hulk (greatest fight EVER). Cap vs loki, hulk saving iron man Black widow vs Hawkeye (sexy) Hulk chasing Widow... Thor's spiral to earth. Hulk abusing puny god. All iron man sequences when downy didn't talk... The new bruce banner is the BEST. PURE FAN BOY JOY! stanleerules, fnord",9,2,5,9 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Nolan's going for lazy melodrama
","Just saw the movie this afternoon and liked it... except for the melodramatic dialog and overly self referential SERIOUSNESS. I did like how they worked Cat Woman and Robin in without being obvious... Love me some Bane! He talks like Napoleon Dynamite on steroids! I Do Love his message, though. Can't really dig his means, but... But, sadly DC fails to equal the drama of Thor vs Iron Man much less Thor vs Hulk. Marvel's World is full of Characters of Action. Nolan's comic book world is, in the end, a mask filled melodrama of 'serious intent.' Whereas Spidy, Avengers, et al.. MARVEL is pure comic book FanBoy magic; Badass fights between Truly awe inspiring CHARACTERS. stanleerulesout",5,1,3,9 July 2013
