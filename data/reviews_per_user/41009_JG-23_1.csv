The Blair Witch Project," The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen
","The Blair Witch Project has to be the worst movie I've ever seen.  It was not scary.  It was not intriguing.  It was boring, and the jerky camera work left me nauseated.  The acting was decent, but the storyline didn't really go anywhere and the cinematography was atrocious.  I understand they were supposed to be film 'students,' but my 10-year-old sister can shoot better footage than this.  At the end I was really wondering why I bothered to sit through the whole thing, and I was definitely sorry that I actually paid to see it in a theater.  If you're still curious about this one, wait until it comes out on video.  At least then, hopefully, the smaller screen will reduce your motion sickness.",1,51,99,12 August 1999
