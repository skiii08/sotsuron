Frost_Nixon," As Good as A heavyweight fight of 'Talk' can be
","So just how entertaining can a a movie centered around an interview be? The answer is far more than thought possible. The story does an excellent job of holding the audience's attention. I didn't want to leave my seat for popcorn.Mr. Frost is an English television host who is fighting to regain glory in America. As soon as he gets word that president Nixon has resigned, he seizes the opportunity to interview The president. Because of Frost's inexperience with interviews and his lucrative offer, Nixon accepts the interview. Frost Soon realizes that he has bitten off far more than he can chew. What happens after this point I think is very well portrayed from Nixon's point of view and From Frost's point of View. The ending was very pleasing to me especially since I had no prior knowledge of the real-life interview.The casting was flawless for this film and it is by far the area that I give it the most credit. I had not seen a whole lot of either Langella of Sheen and they just flat out sold their parts as Nixon and Frost respectively. None of the supporting characters were designed to really have Oscar potential and all of our actors in those roles, especially Kevin Bacon and Rebecca Hall did a great job of standing back in a way. They did not try to overact.I have now seen most of the Oscar contenders this year and fully expect Langella to be a front runner for best Actor. He is definitely in the top 3 performances of the year",8,1,4,2 January 2009
Finding Neverland," Not A Children's Movie
","Finding Neverland was on my 'to see' list for for several months. I had contemplated watching it with my friends but thought it might be too childish because of it's PG rating. When I finally got around to watching it I found more the opposite. Though it may have something to do with peter pan and children, it is an adult-themed film. A reputable score is salvaged from me because of the terrific performances from Winslet and Depp. The children were well casted yet forgettable in my opinion. Dustin Hoffman was neither well casted nor well utilized. My real problems come with director Marc Forster. His previous film 'Monster's Ball' was literal misery too watch. He also directed Quantum of Solace where he again disappointed me after the previous bond movie 'Casino Royale' was such a hit. But I was willing to give him another chance on this one.The bottom line is I felt Forster underachieved in a golden opportunity for creativity. The story sounded like it would appeal to both children and adults and Forster was caught in no- man's land. I can tell you that children will not find this entertaining at all. Their is much too drama and the few elements of imagination throughout the film are mostly only recognized my adults. The tone of the film is certainly not light and happy.I do admire the points that were able to be conveyed without the use of sex, violence and bad language but if your going to take that all out, you should at least make it appeal to kids",6,0,1,30 December 2008
