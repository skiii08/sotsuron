Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A worthy prequel.
","I read with great interest the various movie critics' view of the movie and I was left with the impression that the critics didn't remember the original Star Wars trilogy very well.  Watching the film only reinforced my opinion. If you are wanting this movie to have wonderfully developed characters and a fabulous plot on it's own, I think you are going to the wrong movie. Taken as a prequel, the movie does not necessarily need to have those things; rather that's the purpose of the whole series of movies, in my opinion.The movie starts off a bit slow, but by the end you have been exposed to such wonderful graphics and special effects, any shortcomings that were noticed in the character development and plotline are all but forgotten. I suffered vertigo a number of times throughout the show.The critics were too harsh on the character of Jar-Jar Binks.  Although he wasn't overly as funny as it seems he was supposed to be, he didn't really detract from the quality of the film either.If I were to have one complaint about the film, it would be that one particular battlescene was a little too reminiscent of the marching hammers in 'The Wall' by Pink Floyd.All in all, it was a worthy prequel.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
