The only grievance of the script I would say is the theme it has been performed earlier than with 'minority reviews' with Tom Cruise and 'Dejavu'with Denzel Washington that is why I best gave it 7/10, however nonetheless for sure value watching. Duncan Jones pulls an excellent script in combination- best producer and Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan are each good actors and play their portions smartly within the film. The finishing is in point of fact good as you do not be expecting Jake to study back to the crew an 'addition' to what the supply code can reach I believed it used to be a excellent turn. I might imagine there will likely be a 2nd source code being produced soon I believe it is going to paintings.",7,0,1,12 January 2012
