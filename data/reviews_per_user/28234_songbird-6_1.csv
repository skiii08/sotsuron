Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Cool, but...
","I am sure that anyone seeing the movie will comment on how cool it is. They are right: it is throughly entertaining. However, like any movie, it does have its downfalls.One thing I especially noticed was the CGI. Unfortunately, it distracted me through many parts of the movie.Especially noticeable was a big fight in the end. There was fighting in three different areas. Two had relatively few CGI, but one of the fights was ENTIRELY computer generated. These three scenes were intercut with each other. The one scene that was entirely computer generated contrasted sharply with the others. Being intercut like that took away some of the realism of the movie.On a brighter note, I thought the actors did a commendable job of 'interacting' with the computer generated characters. That is not easy to do realistically, and I thought they did an excellent job.However, I thought character development was somewhat pushed to the wayside. Could it be possible that Lucas, who I so admire, has let a big budget and technology go to his head? Let us hope not.",10,0,1,19 May 1999
