The Blair Witch Project," The only scarey thing about this film was the admission price...
","Went to see this film with a friend having read the hype and heard it described as the scariest film since The Exorsist - we left after the film feeling very disappointed and, quite frankly, bored (as did the other people I spoke to leaving the film).It was very hard to feel any affinity toward any of the characters - the female character was so obnoxious that I felt I wanted to strangle her within minutes of the start!While it is very true that a film does not need gore or the like to be scarey, I find it had to accept that a film can be scarey through a few bits of tent-flapping in the night...The concept behind the film and the hype was interesting, but it was very poorly executed - characters for whom it was virtually impossible to sympathise; so many places where it was obviously an acted film rather than 'genuine' (e.g. when running for your life, you sure don't film your every move with a camera which would slow you down!); the ending was very corny to say the least, and the interviews at the start of the film were obviously highly edited - erm, I thought the whole point of this film was the claim that the 'students' making it disappeared, so how could they have edited it, hmm?All in all, a promising idea in theory, but completely failed in its realisation.",1,0,2,5 September 1999
