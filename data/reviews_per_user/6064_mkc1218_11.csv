10 Cloverfield Lane," Skip it, you know the big plot twist already
","10 Cloverfield Lane.Dullsville, USA With its dramatic irony (given away in the film's title) 10 Cloverfield plays like a lethargic, overly long Twilight Zone episode. And a low-budget first round to an upcoming much better movie. I started admiring the colorful theater carpet around 50 minutes in. Not a good sign. But what pretty abstract designs that rug has!No one in the theater enjoyed this pic, neither young nor old. It was heart-warming though to see a pack of 17-year-olds bond with the 60-year-old couple over their dislike of the film.10 Cloverfield starts with a bang. However, like many movies that do, it's at the expense of character building and engendering audience empathy. I couldn't care less about this heroine. And she has no transformational arc because of the failure to set up her character in the first few minutes of the film.If the plot twist at the end wasn't given away by the movie's title, this story of going out of the frying pan and into the fire would have been much more effective. (Add a star if you didn't see the original Cloverfield. Or just like cute girls in white tank tops.)",5,3,8,13 March 2016
The Hangover," Hysterical! The ultimate Vegas party movie.
","The Hangover will make you want to grab your credit card and call your travel agent. (Luckily I don't have to, I am leaving for Vegas on Thursday. And I only wish I have half as much fun as these guys did.)Rowdy, raucous, and a touch raunchy, The Hangover comes at you with full comic force and doesn't let up, even through the end credits. This is a comedy the way I like my comedies: untamed and out of control. I laughed my (synonym for donkey) off.After sitting through what seems like my 500th bromance, how wonderful for a movie to pull out the comic stops with a clever story and so many great gags that you'll be talking about long after the lights come up.The casting and performances are PERFECT. (Zach Getastagenameforgodssake finally has a breakout role!!) The direction is spot on.And Heather Graham, darling, you look as good as ever at 39. If I were married, I would leave my wife for you.Bruno, you have a hard movie to top.",10,10,19,6 June 2009
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek Into DUMBNESS
","*** SPOILERS ***Star Trek Into DUMBNESS is action packed. Stop reading now if you loved the film because that's the nicest thing I will say. Chris Pine has pretty blue eyes. (Last chance to stop.)Roger Ebert is looking down from heaven wishing he were still alive so that he could rip Star Trek Into Dumbness to shreds. (God bless you, Roger. And while you're up there, send my sympathies to Gene Roddenberry. It's all gone to Sh--, Gene.)Star Trek Into Dumbness will gross a mountain of money because of its solid special effects and frenetic and constant action that has apparently put many viewers' brains on stun. But make no mistake, this high octane Red Bull film is flat out bad.Star Trek The Reboot 'jumps the shark' in the very first sequence here. Spock goes into a volcano, the Enterprise is now a submarine... The only way it could have been more abominable is if Jar Jar Binks had shown up. Actually the Enterprise in the water is a symbol – this movie is a turd. A giant stinking floating turd. Very sad.(Um, note to technical folks: 'Cold Fusion' has nothing to do with actual coldness and cannot freeze super-hot molten lava. But, of course, bad science does not a bad film make – a bad script does that.)The deftly made first film in the franchise rebirth perfectly handled the origins of multiple characters yet managed to be a rip roaring good time - a feat all in itself. It should have been downhill, smooth sailing all the way after that for gents with such talent. But me thinks now our director and screenwriters are spreading themselves a little too thin with too many gigs.The film brings back an old and beloved original series villain and in doing so serves to remind fans how good Wrath of Khan really was.Into Dumbness is a convoluted mess.The characters have completely devolved into caricatures.There are too many jokes by too many characters – a misstep which also strips the drama away with misplaced humor. (Pity our future if everyone's making jokes when big bad things start to happen.)The whole Kirk-Spock 'I am your friend' stuff just doesn't work because the filmmakers have not built the friendship in a meaningful way between these two in the 120 minutes that precede it.There is in fact no relationship building for any of these characters (unless you consider the insufferable Spock and Uhura teen romance squabbles an example of relationship building). Plot and character have been sacrificed for action, with expository speeches in the final act used in an attempt to patch all the holes (and beg viewers for forgiveness if they were still paying attention).I still can't figure out the narrative. Something about explosions I think. Oh, the Klingons were in the film too pretty early on but they were forgotten along the way. We're at war with them now – or so we are TOLD I think. Can't really remember; I may have have gotten an early jump on my 2013 tax returns by that point in the screening.Nice to see RoboCop getting work though – even if it was a one-note role far beneath his talents.Thank the Great God of Cinema that J.J. is just directing the next Star Wars movie and that the reins of that franchise are in other hands. There still may be hope.",2,77,124,22 May 2013
Shutter Island," Please, just one more flashback/dream sequence
","Please, just one more flashback/dream sequence.The 400 that we had just weren't enough.Oy! They just go on and on...This is Scorsese with his heaviest hand ever.An hour of plot with an extra hour of flashbacks makes watching this a grueling test of cinema endurance.Every time I was pulled into the story and the characters - POP! - another flashback/dream sequence to stop the story cold and pull me out of the narrative.Some nice character work by folks like the under-appreciated John Carroll Lynch and some spooky-cool visuals keep the movie from becoming the movie-going equivalent of root canal.When it was all said and done I had wished that my going to the movie theater and forking over $12 was really just a dream sequence of the movie that is my life. But nope, I just checked my wallet. Scorsese's fingerprints are all over it. Again. Didn't I learn anything from The Departed?",3,18,49,20 February 2010
Pacific Rim," Guillermo del TOHO presents... Pacific Dim-witted
","The year 2009 will be marked as the year in which science fiction films changed ADULT movie-going audiences – at least temporarily.In this post Avatar/District 9 world, adult filmgoers want and expect more from their sci fi. They aren't satisfied with aliens blowing up the world just for the hell of it any longer, no matter how cool the explosions. Been there, done that.Avatar and D9 reminded us all that sci fi is most powerful and emotionally satisfying when it has something to say, when the future comments on life in the present. Pacific Rim not only has nothing to say, it says it with way too many words.Pacific Rim takes sci fi cinema back 50 years – and in this case retro is not a good thing. It's Destroy All Monsters meets The Thunderbirds (and more than a touch of Independence Day). It's a production and story more suited for Japanese actors and bad dubbing than for Hollywood.Isn't that giant dinosaur-like monster just a Man In A Monster Suit trampling over a scale model of Tokyo?Where is Raymond Burr?Our weapons have no effect!!!Is Godzilla good in this one, or bad?!Mindless destruction of the planet and special effects can't draw large audiences above the age of puberty, for the moment anyway. 2009's mindless destruction of the planet in '2012' was our last goodbye for that type of fare – for a while anyway. If Elysium, with it's class warfare theme, is a huge hit then I think my analysis that 2009 was a monumental year in sci fi cinema will be proved correct.Pacific Rim is so dim-witted, childish, derivative, and insulting to the audience that studio heads should roll. The whole film feels like a big budget episode of the Power Rangers – only without the really hot pink Power Ranger to take our mind off the on-screen stupidity.Guillermo del Toro, generally a terrific and imaginative storyteller, should change his last name to del TOHO in honor of the film company behind Japan's great monster movies.How strange it will be for Japanese audiences to see a giant monster film dubbed FROM English! It even has the bombastic, Godzilla-like soundtrack nailed perfectly.Pacific Rim might be a tribute to monster movies of old, but it's a genre not deserving of this childish tribute. At least not from Hollywood. And definitely not for $20 – yes, IMAX 3D cost me $20 here in New York. I could have seen the same movie for free on television at 3 a.m. and have laughed at all the shortcomings – and even enjoyed some of them in the way that bad sci fi can be fun. But the same shortcomings at $20 are a whole lot less amusingly goofball.Pacific Rim seems to have been created for no other reason than to sell monster toys and robot toys. Instead of turning a toy franchise into a movie franchise, it seems the studio was aiming for the reverse. I don't know how the movie will perform internationally, but here in America it seems that Pacific Rim will generate tons of unsold toy store plastic that will need recycling. Definitely appropriate for the BIG, three dimensional recycling job I saw last night.(No need to talk about plot or character. It's all tangential to the robot/monster battles. I will say, however, that seeing Idris Elba slumming in this picture is very sad. Watch the first couple episodes of his BBC show 'Luther.')Two stars out of 10.I would rather have been mining coal.",2,11,24,14 July 2013
Super 8," Elements cobbled together from other Spielberg films ***spoilers
","Super 8, derivative and disappointing at its best, can be summarized using elements from the other sci-fi/thrillers that Spielberg either directed, produced, or exec-produced.Some annoying kids find a map (Goonies) – including a fat kid who likes to eat (Goonies) – and they come up against the military which is trying to track down an alien on the loose (E.T.).The creature has created issues for the townsfolk who express concern at a meeting with the sheriff (Jaws) and they eventually have to evacuate because of a made-up disaster (Close Encounters).The alien, who is a really a spider (Arachnaphobia) that has been collecting items so that he can get home (E.T.), has the ability to make a psychic connection with humans (Close Encounters). One of the kids has a seemingly useless obsession that winds up helping to save the day in a climactic sequence (fireworks here and inventions in the Goonies) however the creature is much too smart to fall for such a trick (Jaws - 'he's either very smart or very stupid'). An old guy, who is an expert on this creature (Jaws) winds up dying while the army shoots through the town and tanks roll (War of the Worlds).Then the characters put the story together in one long expositional scene and we are not really sure how they figured it all out (Minority Report). It seems the monster is really a misunderstood good guy (Goonies) who makes a connection with our hero (ET, Close Encounters) and then flies home (E.T), but not before a lot of missing people are returned (Close Encounters) and lots of appliances fly around (Poltergeist).The End.",5,483,640,12 June 2011
Inception," Incomprehension is more like it
","Inception?Incomprehension is more like it.Techno-babble, psycho-babble, and just plain babble fill a third of the film, providing the audience with the rules of the game and the back story of the main character. Unfortunately, much of it is unnecessary and difficult to follow and takes the place of character interaction, character growth, and emotion. Inception is a gargantuan, cinematic meditation on dreams and reality. Zzzzzz. That's the sound of me snoring.The only thing worse than being bored at a film is being bored AND not giving a crap. And that's the case here. There's not a single character to care about. Oh sure there is a preponderance of cool effects, people hanging weightless in time and space and climbing on ceilings, but without a cohesive narrative or anyone to root for, they're just pretty images flashing on a big screen at a frenetic pace.Don't get me wrong, somewhere there is a good film here. Or at least there could have been. But as it stands it is a story not well told.Which is easier to explain: the plot of this film or the praise hefted upon it by critics and everyone else on this forum? Has Christopher Nolan risen to the level of Marty Scorsese and James Cameron where films are lauded despite whatever self-indulgent, effects-laden dreck they put on the screen?All throughout Inception I wanted to shoot myself so that I could wake up from this bad movie. Unfortunately my top stopped spinning and the reality set in: another lousy film in the Summer of 2010. Wake me when it's over.",1,13,26,18 July 2010
Arrival," *** SPOILERS*** A dreary, morose Close Encounters
","The aliens have arrived. And they are – Holy Calamari People, Batman! – giant squid. The giant squid communicate in writing by shooting magical retractable ink out of their tentacles onto a transparent wall. It's up to linguist Amy Adams to decipher their communication before the other crazy countries in the world try to blow up everything.The Calamari People, who float in a room of steam, write in circles – which is apparently how they experience time. Without a beginning or end. They can see their lives in their entirety. And the Calamari People are here to give humanity a gift, we find out: Once you unlock their language and become fluent, you will experience time in the circular way they do. It's a lot like becoming fluent in French and suddenly realizing why the French love Jerry Lewis so much.From the lack of character and character development to the way the story unfolds, the movie is like watching a real-time long shot of a grave digger digging a grave on the grayest of all days. It's morose and filled with dread. Monotone and monotonous. Shovel after shovel after shovel, and he never seems like he is getting anywhere.The entire pic is filled with 'music' that is just a bunch of low hums that underscore the dread and monotone. It doesn't give us a clue to how we should be feeling. And that's why I go to the movies, to feel. How about awe at seeing the spaceships? The joy and celebration of the first breakthrough of communication? Nope, we get tedium and low bassy hums.Jeremy Renner plays a physicist who doesn't do any physics, and he nicknames the two Calamari People we see Abbott & Costello. Although you can't tell them apart, Abbott becomes my favorite character in the movie because he gets to die midway through and doesn't have to suffer through the rest of the film. Lucky Abbott. Throw in voiceovers and flashbacks that we find out are really flashforwards because time is actually circular to Amy Adams, and you have a film that yearns to be so much more than the real-time gravedigging than it is. It's the type of intellectual pretentiousness I thought only the Nolans could put on the screen.",1,1151,2253,13 November 2016
The Big Short," Eh! Mildly entertaining when it's not annoying
","The Big Short tells one story too many and feels jumpy and haphazard – especially since the characters in each storyline never intersect. It's really three movies in one – and would have been better served by being two stories well told.With a frenetic 'turn five cameras on and let the actors improv' style, the film's hyperactive chattiness completely strips the emotion from every scene. It's all pretty headache inducing to be honest.The film also has 10 minutes of unnecessary exposition done with a 'wink wink' style that makes you not even pay attention to what's being said. For a second it feels clever until you realize that the content really is superfluous, interrupts the narrative, and pulls you out of the film.For me, the Big Short's final nail is the overly-preachy ending where the film revels in its own self-importance.The performances are GREAT, however, with Steve Carell destined for an Oscar nom. Ryan Gosling shows some real talent. Wait for Redbox on this one.",6,22,46,25 November 2015
Prometheus," Awful
","***SPOLIERS, BUT DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE***Prometheus is one of the worst films that I have ever seen in the theater.I had no idea what the story was and, quite frankly, did not care after a while. I wanted all the characters to die, all 73 of them. Seriously, what is the point of all these characters? And the fact that they are so uninteresting?Nothing happens in the first hour. And when things do start happening, you have no idea how they relate to each other.The music seems to be from a different, happier movie. (Jerry Goldsmith is turning over in his grave.)As my buddy pointed out, the aliens give signs to the people of Earth telling us where the base is from which they plan to destroy Earth. Huh? Maybe I am missing something here, or these are just really stupid aliens.Two characters announce they are going to have sex in 10 minutes, and we never see the scene or have it referred to again in the whole film. Don't get me excited to see a scantily clad Charlize Theron and then let me down. That's just not right.What is up with Guy Pearce channeling Keir Dullea from the film 2010? What is the point of having a young actor play an old man unless that old man is transformed into the young actor at some point in the film? Why not just get an old actor? Let's save some money in our makeup budget.And the whole search for God premise and its really bad development and symbolism was cringe worthy. I felt sorry for the filmmakers watching the entire thing.On the positive side, there are two legitimately cool scenes in the film. And Charlize's complexion is flawless, the movie looked great, and my popcorn was fresh. Way fresher than this movie.",1,13,20,10 June 2012
The Wolverine," A fish-out-of-water, ninja, superhero mutant movie!
","A fish-out-of-water, ninja, superhero mutant movie?! Yes!Throw in a little Shakespearean family intrigue and a brooding tortured lead character (all via Akira Kurosawa) and you have one of the most interesting films of this woeful summer.The Wolverine is a breath of superhero fresh air. A new setting, a change in tone, and a personal journey for the Hamlet of the mutant world gives the superhero genre a much needed shot in the arm. The Wolverine makes The Man of Whining Steel look so so dated.Some very nice character work and subtlety, particularly in the first half of The Wolverine, is undermined by the 47 clunky needless dream sequences that 'tell' rather than 'show.' Seriously, it's as if a third-grader was hired to polish the work of A-list screenwriters. The script changes were done in crayon, with doodles drawn in the margins.Superhero fans will no doubt be disappointed with all the attention placed on character here, but these slow insightful moments are what make the film interesting. God knows we didn't need another high adrenaline summer film chock full of pointless action (Star Trek Into Dumbness, Pacific Dim-witted).That's not suggesting that the body count is low. It's not. The Wolverine slices and dices his way through all of Japan with his ginsu-like claws. The set pieces, except for two, are not grand or spectacular though. Not something I really minded since the genre mashup and story kept things interesting – for me at least.Once again: a fish-out-of-water, ninja, superhero mutant movie. If that's not a movie crying 'fresh' I don't know what could be. Sharknado, perhaps?Oh, then there is the ethereal, graceful beauty of female lead Tao Okamoto. You just have to see her in this. Photos from the web cannot do her justice. A model appearing in her first film, she is an absolute natural. The exact opposite of Cindy Crawford. Does anyone remember Fair Game? (Hot movie poster, bad movie.) The development of the relationship between Tao's character and The Wolverine in the first 60 minutes is incredibly well-handled and Tao shows such a strength, confidence, and vulnerability. It makes those interrupting 89 dream sequences seem that much more sinful and intrusive. (We get it already! The Wolverine is a tortured soul. Enough.)All the loose ends are pulled together neatly in a third act that is pretty generic superhero fare. A letdown really.The sum of its parts is greater than the whole, and given the pathetic summer at the cinema this has been, The Wolverine gets seven ninja stars out of 10.-- There's a post-credit scene here, so stay to the end. I, unfortunately, did not get the memo until it was too late.",7,3,8,28 July 2013
