The Avengers," Reviews for Avengers
","The movie engages the viewer from a very strong opening sequence through the two bonus scenes included in the closing credits. The nearly two and a half hour running time passes by swiftly and leaves you eagerly awaiting a follow-up sequel.While Whedon smartly recognizes how key Downey Jr.'s Stark is to the story, he also allows most all of his cast, heroes and villain, ample opportunities to shine, both in dialogue and action. Solid entertainment and much better than I'd expected from the maestro of midcult, Joss Whedon.visit: http://bollywood-updates.net",6,3,9,16 May 2012
