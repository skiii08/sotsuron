The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Mockingjay Part 1
","A week ago I loaded up the the first movie not expecting much, but was yanked into an interesting world. I am disappointed whenever I enjoy a movie and then I see it crapped on in the reviews of the users of this sight. Part of that may be the unfair vendetta against adaptations of popular books to film. In this case I have no basis to compare it to so my analysis is of the film alone.
Overall I think this is a good movie. I do not think I held up to the first two movies in the series that I have only recently watched. An I coming from the perspective of not watching the final installment.
I would like to start with the bad:
The main problem of the film is the ending, mainly stemming from the fact that it is an incomplete story split into two parts. Which is a common scheme of studios to maximize profits, but the studio can not take away all the good the talented people who work on films do that make many great elements.
The main problems with the end is the trap set by President Snow. From the time the rebel forces entered the building it was obviously a trap, and I think that it is a weak story mode from the President to let the team return with the victors, just for the chance of Peeta under the influence of some science fiction thing to kill Kantniss. (Though I think there may be room to redeem this element in the final installment).
Though the good thing is these are the only large issues with movie, but an ending to a movie is one of most important elements and can bring the movie down quite a bit.
Though it did do the same things the previous movie did well. Well acted. Great design. Good story. Well paced.
The main thing of all three movies as been the realism of a totalitarian government that is oppressive and suppressive of information.
Specifically this movie displays the start of a civil war and the unavoidable reality of destruction on both sides. It also displays propaganda on both sides.
I think that it has been a solid display of a love triangle, but I think I will wait until the next movie to make a final verdict.
Overall good movie, and I will watch the next one, which is a positive, the movie left me still wanting more.",7,1,1,22 May 2020
Nacho Libre," Stupid and Disturbing at some parts, but funny
","This is a very funny movie that I enjoyed a little bit mostly because of how funny Jack Black was as Nacho and everything he did worked. None of the supporting cast really worked besides the cute little cubby kid who was cute and funny. The looks and costumes of the opponents looked disturbing and the fat lady was pointless and mad me want to hit something. Though the when he beats the best wrestler and he excites the children was good and one of the best parts. Some of the humor didn't work and made me roll my eyes, but for me the negatives didn't overtake the positive aspects of this film.",6,0,2,2 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Clones
","I grew up watching this movie on VHS along with the Phantom Menace when I was young, but for no particular reason I peg it as my least favorite. I big Star Wars fan, and what makes me a fan is that I like the movies, seriously most Star Wars fans hate Star Wars.
As I got older I think I prefer it to The Phantom Menace and Solo.
The worst aspect of the movie is the romance between Anakin and Padm√© it is poorly written and badly acted, mostly be Hayden Chrsitianson. But I have come to enjoy it over the years at the pure stupidity of the dialogue. I think the basic outline of the story of Anakin being the protector and them getting drawn into a larger adventure is not the problem and if it was executed well could have been a better part of the movie.
Though the best quality of the movie is the action. The speeder chase, the fight between Obi wan and Jango Fett, and the entire battle of Geonosis. All of these are superior to the Pod Racing scene and the duel of fates sequence.
Both the deception of the Emperor and failure of the council, display the intriguing politics of the world of the late republic.
Another positive is the first steps toward his decent to the dark side. Ewan McGreggor as Obi Wan is one of the greatest parts of the trilogy as a whole.
But the main reason I am draw to it is that it is Star Wars and that is usually just enough for me to nerd out and pick up on the small nerdy details and will push the movie over the edge of being great.",8,1,1,23 May 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," It is a great movie and one of the best in the MCU!!
","Just having all these characters in one movie together makes for a great movie. With the large cast you are always going to run into the problem of the movie being cluttered. The crew did a great job balancing it and it only ever hurts the movie when we return to one story line then I realize that we had been away from them for a while. The build up is well of 10 years really pays off except that it seems that the tension and the build up had died down after civil war. This is not really a problem with the movie its self, but going forward we already have movies announced for 'dead' characters. And from the moment I watched it for the first time I can agree that it will be undone. Upon re watch there was ) emotional weight to that scene when there should be. When it is most likely undone in the next movie it will be making that scene almost pointless. Though it is a great movie that lived up to the hype they had the story lines from other movies continued through other movies. The action was great and almost everything else. Thanos is a great villain who does succeed and is a well crafted character. This is a great movie and I think my biggest problem with it is that they set it up to have more ways to mess it up in Endgame.",9,1,2,30 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Over 2,000 angry 1 star reviews can't stop me from liking this movie
","It has been 2 1/2 years since the Last Jedi Ruined Star Wars. Many of the reviews claim this to be a plot whole ridden, boring, incoherent poorly written mess.
And all the blame falls on Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kenndey (The second one makes zero sense, one executive can't ruin or make all the creative stories that ruin the movie for you)
I am not here to tell you this is the best Star Wars Movie or a Masterpiece, but I think it is quite a great enjoyable movie.
I think Rian Johnson directed and wrote a movie with beautiful cinematography, great character development, a thrilling story with unexpected turns. Along with Johnson many other people brought this film to life. Anthony Daniels, Carrie Fisher, and especially Mark Hamill returned to the series and preformed just as well if not better as they did 40 years ago and Daisy Riddle, John Boyaga, Oscar Issac, and Adam Driver returned and gave Good performances (not through the roof, but not an abomination). The special effects brought it to life with superior technology to the last generation of films, but top notch for today.
******I don't expect anyone to read further than this***** (Not that I don't recommend it, but I personally don't read reviews this long, just right them)
I have know idea how long this review is and I don't want it to just be about what people complained about, but I think I need to rant about the ridiculous absurdities of many of the low nit picky complaints that people hold as legitimate complaints in their reviews of this movie. One thing that people held as truly running the movie was the uses of the force introduced as new in this movie. A common complaint is that the force is just magical and the creators of this new movie are 'just making up force powers at this point'. Some of these new powers introduced are a force connection between two people where they can transfer matter, physically touch and see each other, the ability to move your self though space, the power to survive in space, the ability of a force ghost to bring lightning from the sky, and the ability project your self across the galaxy and trick people into your appearance being real. The first problem with this is that fundamentally the force is a fictional made up element, that exists in a world that leans more towards fantasy than science fiction, therefore YES THE FORCE IS MAGICAL. Though these are problems that can be held against Star Wars as a whole. And that is fine you can not like the force. (There is sacrifice in that it is a giant plot convince that allows for things to happen that may seem like luck. But it is a sacrifice because it opened the door to a magical story that touches on basics of human ideals of what is truly good. And it has captured and continued to capture fans from around the world, and of all ages since 1977). We have no reason to think from previous that we know as an audience everything about the force, and there is no rule that you can't introduce new things, and it creates more creative freedom for the story teller to introduce previously unknown elements, and if they break previously establish rules I think that it is a worthy sacrifice for good story telling. Though the examples from earlier have some falsies they do in some case introduce some plot holes. There may be a gap between what we have seen before and what this movie displayed and there may be an unexplained reason that it was never used explore. That is the definition of a Plot Hole, it a hole that can be filled in the future. None of these break any clearly established rule made by the years and years of Star Wars media, and the creators of a high budget film should not have to hold to the most minute detail reviled by some guy in one line of a book or a comic book. (To be fair I am a big fan of material beyond the film and it does not bother me). The reason for Kylo and Rey is establish a clear reason for its origin (Snoke connected them). It is clear establishment of previous movies that the force can connect people across great distances, in this movie the degree was greater and it establishes there is a physically connection this time around. Though we have no reason to believe that this can't happen in a stronger occurrence and that this is rare occurrence that was seldom used in the past. Kylo and Rey are established as very strong and Snoke is established as even stronger. Leia is a beloved character that has clearly established that she has a strong connection to the force (she is the daughter of Darth Vader, the chosen one), and there is not reason we should not believe she pursued a stronger connection to the force over the past 30 years. As for how it is portrayed I agree it looks like superman, it clearly could have handled that better. As for the ability for her to survive in space, I don't think it has little to do with the force, it is a false assumption people have that space kills you instantly, and we have no reason to believe she was out there for that long. In the movies it is a new development that force ghost have the ability to connect with the physical world. The movie does not explain why that is or why it does not happen very often. This is a plot hole, but I think there is room for that to be filled. A force projection it what people have come to call Luke's manifestation on Crait, and it is establish to be a rare power that require a lot of concentration, and for Luke it lead to death (it took all his energy) and I don't think this was the best time for Luke's death and maybe there could have been more to tell with Luke Skywalker. Though just because this power is unestabilhed it does not make it bad, it does not mean you can't like it or think that it cheapens the story. Another plot hole that is really truly a nit pick is the bombs that blow up the dreadnought in the very first scene, they fall in space and blow up the ship. The movie offers no explanation other than that they are all stuck togther as if they are magnetic. An explenation on how these ships and bombs worked would have worked against the movie and is worse than no explanation. Poe yells 'I know everyone I am talking to knows this, but the bombs are magnetic and if I was trying to command an attack I would just say bombs.' Holdo's hyperspace ramming of the First Order capital ship is some thing we have never seen, but from the movie we don't know the difficulty of what happened and even if it made no sense what so ever she made a sacrifice which if you where paying attention you are supposed to see that see is a hero and not just a jerk. These critisims spread through the whole movie and people have dragged this mentality onto the next movie also.
I love this movie I am not going to deny that I love it. I love all the Star Wars movie. Many of the other reviews claim this to me poorly written movie with no character development. I just do not see that. I think that Rian Johnson wrote a great movie. It is complex on many levels. The most valid controversy in this movie the portrayal of Luke Skywalker. I understand that people did not like it, Mark Hamill himself wasn't crazy about it, but I like. I he is a broken hero, he has become a legend on and off the screen, this movie humanizes him. He failed and decides to run from his failure and guilt (heroes do not always have to be right). The Force Awakens established that it affected out three main heroes, Luke being the worst (He ran away to never be found). But why did he leave a map, I think it is clear his motives and ideas changed from the time he left to the time Rey found him. When he reveals the truth of the night Kylo turned he admitted his weakness, he is human and that is powerful. Though he is wrong in his willingness to help. When Yoda shows up he learns that faluire is not the point where you give up, but the point to learn the most and he uses all his strength to save the resistance.
Rey and Kylo I think are the weakest of all the arcs in this movie. Though it is not absence or all bad there is just some faults, overall I like it. I feel like the dialogue and tension is a little awkward, but for the most part I look past that. Though on re watch I don't think romantic tension is completely out of the blue, I still think it is weird. They are conflicted and on opposites sides thinking they can both get the other to join. Rey individually is lost and scared. She seeks answers and Luke fails at that, but that does not ruin her desire to do good. Though she takes a dangerous road that is unlikely to succeed straight into darkness. Kylo is conflicted and his growth in this movie is breaking free of everything and trying not to be controlled. His defiance of evil authority and opens the door to new ideas. He kills Snoke (A wonderful twist). I did not expect it.
Poe, he is very likable and we love him as a audience, and at the begin we see Holdo as a jerk, but by the end we she that it was Poe's fault he was a hotshot that did not understand his leaders and was not open listening. Holdo taught him a lesson that he learned in the end. Though we are to see that Leia sees him as a future leader with lots of potential.
Finn was running away he was scared in the beginning of the movie he held that he just wanted revenge and lived in fear. Rose changed that view in his mind that he was a hero to the resistance not just an enemy of first order. Though Roses line is cheesy 'save what you love not kill what you hate'. This is what Finn need to see and her she saved them and then he saved her. Though the kiss was thrown in almost out of nowhere. I does not work and it is weird because he does not feel the same way.
This movie is not absent of substance the plot lines, and characters draw me in, and the action and the way it looks is great. I don't think that the Kanto Byte was a weird sub plot that was a waist. It was successful in character development. Also this movie is not political or pushing an evil agenda.",8,4,15,6 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," 'Not if anything to say about it, I have'
","I love it! In my opinion it is easily the greatest of the prequels. Ever single time it manages to make get emotional, I feel the hurt of all the characters and watch as the republic, a free state protected by the virtuous Jedi, is replaced by the evil empire.
It shows the demise of the one of the greatest movie villains Darth Vader. It hurts even if in the first two movies his portrayal is sub par. Hayden Christenson stepped up his acting, not by much but it is better.
Of all the Star Wars movies this one has the greatest and most exciting action. The battle of Corosant, Obi v Grevious, Yoda v Palpatine, and Anakin v Obi Wan. They are all entertaining, I don't care if anyone thinks they are over choreographed. The are entertaining and capture the magic of Star Wars.
Every time it just gets better, with the addition of the clone wars and other smaller media it gives amazing context and makes the whole trilogy better. But even without it, this movie is still great.
The story and characters do not compare to the original trilogy, but this one is far more exciting. I am not going to say it is better than the OT, but it is easily one of the best additions since then.
None of the performances are through the roof, but Ewan McGregor, Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, Ian McDermid, and Samuel Jackson are all endearing characters and entertaining to watch on screen.
In recent years this movie as gain more and more respect. It now has some of the most iconic scenes in all of Star Wars.
The politics of all fictional world are always an element that pulls me and makes the situation be comparable to reality, though TPM may be about the taxation of trade routes this movies shows the fall of democracy and the rise of a 'fascist' empire. And with Palpatine, an amazing villain pulling all the strings.
Though the movie sucks it ends with hope and ends with a double sunset the perfect way that leads chronologically to the OT.
Though I do have a few gripes with the movie they are all small compared to all the things I love.
Anakin and Padme's dialogue with each other is in this movie better than the previous two movies, but in most scenes it still falls flat. Though the part it plays as a driving force of Anakin's fall is the falls nicely into everything Anakin has been warned about and Palpatine used it to fuel his turn.
I do not like the excessive use of CGI clones, a bit more practicality would have been nice, though they are all supposed to look the same, it would have been hard to pull off the other way too, but they could have at least tried.
And Chewbacca did not need to be in the movie, but that is silly and such a small insignificant nit pic.
The Star Wars cannon still leaves open room for stories of Yoda, Obi Wan and Qui-Gon in exile, set up by this movie and leaves open how and if Palpatine had a part in Padme's death.
This movie is great it is a toss up if I prefer it to my other favorite installments after the originals, but it is still great.",9,1,1,26 May 2020
The Croods," 'I have an idea'
","Nicolas Cage and Ryan Reynolds, two actors that just the fact they are in it gives the the movie points in my book.
Even if I did not know it was them starting in the movie the characters a great forces, butting heads both too show the short comings of the father Grug, his failure to face fear and try new things, and the comedy of Guy who is not a cave man coming up with many ideas of things just obvious to use, but in the world of the movie they are Brand New! With that Grig persist to come with his own ideas that are failed versions of things we have to day like a mobile home, rocks that he stacks together for someone to presumably carry.
The movie's message seems to be to 'not be afraid of new things' and to 'follow the light to tomorrow'.
The movie portrays that Grug is putting his foot down on anything new, until Guy comes along to show everyone that new can be good and useful and teaches Grug that lesson.
By the end of the movie after Grug puts everyone else first be throwing them into the unknown, where minutes earlier he accepted the Guy was not wrong and new was not bad and you should not be afraid. After being stranded an idea goes off in Grugs head and he builds a contraption to return to his family.
By the end Eb, the older daughter, summarizes that's the family learned to follow the light. I think that is life we should pursue light as I. Truth and goodness, but in the context of the movie that does not make too much sense since the only development is is that they learned the previous lesson and have now become nomadic as opposed to cave people.
Eb, I think that is her name, which I think sounds too much like Eve. She starts of rebellious and shaky relationship with her father, which translates to today's society very well. Her desire for something more leads them to Guy, who she ends up falling for and as a averagely constructed romance, that is endearing and comedic, but not one of the better elements. By the end both Eb and Grug overcome their problems and Grug fixes it with a Hug his new invention. Which is very endearing, probably the best part of the film.
All the other family members have there good comedic moments, serve as comic relief.
This movie is funny. The story is ok, it did not hit me very hard, so the movie would land for me close for Ok than Good. The story is weak in the sense that it is very vague where they are going and in the end it still seems very vague. What is tomorrow obviously it means the next day, but I feel like they try to make it out to be something more as a vague place that is were they are going which is nowhere. We learn late in the movie that Guy's family died in tar which is tragic and funny at the same time. We learn his motivation is just to keep on going, but there is no clear end goal.
There is a sequel that is coming out this year that could make a clear objective of where they are going, but you can never expect too much from a sequel.
Overall this movie is funny has the threads of good story, but when watching it did not hit as hard as it might have. The movie is ok a strong 6/10, I don't plan on watching it anytime soon and probably will not stick in my memory.",6,0,0,26 May 2020
The Wizard of Oz," Classic movie
",This movie is a great story that has effects that do not age well. The music is great and the characters are lovable. The movie flows well but is just good.,7,1,3,6 January 2019
