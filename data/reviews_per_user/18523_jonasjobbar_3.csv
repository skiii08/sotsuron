The Blair Witch Project," 'F-ing' Scary... Maan'-best horror movie EVER
","This movie is scarier than the Texas Chain Saw Massacre, New York Ripper or the Hellraiser movies. At the same time it is blood and gore-less. It is the best horror movie ever (before Psycho and Texas...)I guess it depends on your state of mind when you see it. If you really 'enter' the movie and take it for real- it's the scariest movie ever (I could not walk up or a down a staircase for 2 months without getting flashbacks of the ending), if you for some reason do not, this movie sucks... Big Time. I will not write anything more about it. Just see it and see it while being in the right mood. For me it's NOT a popcorn flick where you talk with your friends while watching it. That won't work. If that's what you wan't rent Jason, Freddie or Michael Myers movies instead.ANY MORE HORRROR MOVIES LIKE THIS OUT THERE? /J",9,1,2,1 August 2003
The Green Mile," Wonderful, highly rated , but still underrated
","SPOILER FREE _ I won't tell you the storyI have not read the book, but I will. Steven King should write drama instead of horror, at least when it comes to movie scripts (compare Children of the corn etc...).WOnderful story - PAR with Shawshank redemption WOnderful actors - Hanks and ALL the other major roles WOnderful narrative WOnderful cinematography WOnderful musicIf you don't cry you are  a Psycopat, this is a film that pierces your heart! /J",10,1,2,1 August 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," TOP 5 EVER !
","Wonderful touching story that will make you cry AND feel extremely good inside. STEVEN KING proves that he is one of the best story writers EVER.Superb acting by Freeman et al. Wonderful narrative, music, cinematorgraphy and backward looking story that escalates throughout the film.A work of genious, J",10,1,2,1 August 2003
