Casablanca," A timeless classic and one of the great films of all time.
","Shot as just another film in the days when Hollywood was pumping out movies like an assembly line.  Indeed, the film is not shot as an epic with sweeping scenes of battles or with elaborate sets or special effects.  So why all the fuss?This film has grown in stature because of the brilliant acting of the two lead characters, the remarkably witty and clever dialogue, and the war-torn romance that is the heart of the picture.  In other words, it is an actor-driven film with a terrific script and a story about love, war, and politics, i.e., a formula for a masterpiece.Put simply, Ingrid Bergman is electric in this film.  She is stunningly beautiful and turns in a remarkable performance as the brave and sensual Ilsa.  Her facial expressions alone convey more than most actresses can do with monologues.  She convincingly plays a young women torn between her ideals and affection for her husband-mentor and her passion for Rick, the one true love of her life.Not to be outdone, Bogart's performance is probably the strongest of his career.  He simultaneously manages to play a self-absorbed sulking saloon keeper, passionate lover, and sentimental patriot.  Rick is a complex and deep character, deeply wounded by Ilsa's choice to leave him at a train station in Paris to tend to her once forsaken husband.On top of this passionate romance, the film is paced by its political subplot, which is all the more interesting since it was filmed during World War II.  The script deftly weaves jabs at the Nazis and packs political themes throughout.  Moreover, the superb script conveys complex character interactions and messages without hitting the viewer over the head with explanation or narration.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the underlying negotiating between Captain Renault and Rick on a variety of topics throughout the film.Bolstering the performances of Bogart and Bergman is the heady acting of Henreid and Rains.  Indeed, Rains' performance as Captain Renault is one of the great buddy-womanizer roles of all-time.  He is simultaneously charming and without conviction.  Henreid delivers a terrific performances as the political icon Victor Laszlo.  He is both dashing and courageous without ever trying to overshadow Bogart.This is a great film that gets better each time you see it.",10,1,2,1 January 2004
The Godfather: Part II," A Great Movie in its Own Right
","Sequels are rarely good.  Even more scarce is a great sequel.  This is one of those special sequels that equals, if not surpasses, the original work. The acting is, of course, superb and Robert De Niro is brilliant in his supporting role as the young Vito.  What is perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this great movie is that it is almost entirely fresh.  In other words, it was not tied directly to a book like the original and afforded the script writers room to be even more creative.  A masterpiece.",8,1,3,11 January 2004
Gone with the Wind," If you like rich brats and racists . . .
","Shot before our country got enough sense to integrate, this film celebrates Old Southern (Civil War) society, slavery and all.  Topping off the already repugnant theme of the film, the lead female character is a rich brat who lacks the common sense to know a good thing when she sees it.  The upshot of all this is that South still loses the war (thank goodness) and our Southern Bell doesn't get the guy in the end because she jilts him one too many times.To be sure, the film is visually stunning and (particularly for its time) is beautifully shot.  Clark Gable turns in a terrific performance as the handsome and rugged Rhett Butler.  Unfortunately, Vivien Leigh (Scarlett O'Hara) is no match for him on the screen.  Hattie McDaniel's performance as Mammy is also noteworthy not only because it was expertly carried out, but also because it (in ironic contrast to the story of the film) is a celebrated moment for African-American actors.At the end of the day, this is a pretty picture with a great performance be a Hollywood legend that is marred by its terrible flawed message. Frankly, I don't give a damn about this film.",5,6,20,1 January 2004
Garden State," Quirky Real-World Romantic Comedy
","This is a romantic comedy with a real-world edge. No holly wood over-the-top knight in shining armor stuff. Just a story about two people from dysfunctional families (read normal) who find security with each other.Excellent and interesting character development and very strong performance by Portman. She's come a long way from the awful performances in the Star Wars films. She is funny, totally believable, and dynamic. Pulls off some serious scenes to boot.Not your run-of-the-mill film. Quirky script and nothing is romanticized. Main characters are flawed but likable people. You are interested in the characters throughout.You should see it with a date. Great film to use in exchange for an action adventure film later on with your significant other.",8,0,1,5 September 2004
The Last Samurai," More than I bargained for
","I went in to The Last Samurai with relatively low expectations.  I'm generally not a Cruise fan and was not impressed with the trailers for this movie.  However, a few friends said that the film was excellent, so I gave it a shot.I'm glad that I did.  The movie is beautifully shot, well acted, and tells a story of honor and courage in a very unobtrusive or didactic way.  Really a terrific night at the cinema.",8,1,2,11 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A stunning achievement by Peter Jackson and friends
","Return of the King is a sweeping, moving, and breathtaking achievement. As with the first two films in this remarkable trilogy, director Peter Jackson has done a masterful job of translating Tolkien's prodigious book into a streamlined and cunning movie.  In the process, Jackson may very well have created the greatest movie trilogy of all-time.  Moreover, King stands on its own as a great film for its depth of story, character development, imagination, and visual brilliance.The film follows two story lines.  First, there is the tale of the hobbits' journey to Mount Doom to destroy the ring of power.  Here, Jackson does a masterful job of developing the deep friendship between Frodo and Sam even further, creating an even stronger bond between the two friends who come closer and closer to peril with each step they take towards Mordor. Building on the foundation of the first two films, Jackson's work in King enables the viewer to feel true emotions for Frodo and Sam.  Sitting in the theater, you pity and admire these two characters.  Indeed, while the name of the film is 'Return of the King,' at the heart of the movie is this friendship between Frodo and Sam and their joint battle against the great evil of the ring.  Bolstering this rich story of friendship is Jackson's artful depiction and development of the complex character Gollum, as well has his edge-of-your-seat work with Shelob.The second storyline of the film is, of course, Aragorn's return to Gondor to reclaim the throne of men.  Here, the film is packed with stunning and powerful battle sequences that seamlessly blend digital special effects with terrific live action.  As war sequences go, King stands amongst the very best in film history.  Amidst the action, Jackson is able to deliver stories of heroism and human frailty that empower and move the viewer. Particularly well done is Eowyn's confrontation of the Nazgul Witch King.  Each time I saw the film, the audience cheered.These two stories are artfully cut together in a way that keeps this 3 hour and change film moving.  Almost gone from this film are the slow-talking Ents introduced in the Two Towers, which threatened to put some audience members asleep.Of course, Jackson was forced to cut certain stories from Tolkien's third book in the interest of not keeping the audience overnight.  Gone are the downfall of Saruman, the romance between Eowyn and Faramir, the the hobbits recapture of the shire.  While the elimination of some of these scenes from the film may disappoint some of Tolkien loyalists, Jackson's choices work and enable Tolkien's main themes to come to life on the screen.The most difficult challenge facing King is our tendency to compare it to Jackson's other two films.  Naturally, one's inclination is to immediately decide which of the three films was the greatest.  This analysis has the risk of diminishing the audience's appreciation for the splendor and depth of King as its own film.  At the end of the day, Jackson's achievement in King is two fold.  He has not only made a great movie, but has now made three great films in a row.  King is a powerhouse movie.  See it.",10,1,3,1 January 2004
