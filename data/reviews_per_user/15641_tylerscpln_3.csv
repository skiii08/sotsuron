The Hangover," One of the best movies and by far the best comedy of 2009
","I was at the movie theatre many a times this year and i have got to say that this movie was a great and fun time at the theatre, although maybe that could have been because school had just got out for summer, by far the funnest movie of the year. As a comedy it was a perfect blend of dirty,nasty jokes and fun adventure (comedic adventure i might add). The chemistry between Cooper, Helms, Galif(whatever), and Bartha was beyond awesome, and Mike Tyson too, he was actually really good. Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), holy crap, Mr. Chow was one hell of an annoying dude but he definitely made a perfect villain for the guys. The only problem i found was that towards the end it did get rushed a bit. I felt that they could have slowed it down and explained a it a little bit but this was the only problem i found. The end credits were by far the greatest end credits in the history of movies. I recommend this movie to everyone over the age of 14 as this movie is very dirty, but if you are over 14 see this movie you will not regret it. BELIEVE ME I AM ALWAYS RIGHT!",9,1,2,7 May 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Not as bad as everybody says
","Everybody says that this movie sucks and is by far the worst movie of 2009. I completely disagree. As much as yes, the script was weak, and the acting was bland, and they tried to make up with it by using a hot girl, massive special effects, and epic battle sequences. I found myself enjoying this film. People disagree with the addition of the funny twins, stating that they took away the true seriousness of the movie, but in my opinion i think they provided a comic relief that was seriously lacking in the first. Now I'm not saying that this movie is better than the first, the first is undoubtedly better. I think what people don't understand is the fact that this is not a movie meant for an Oscar, but a movie meant to entertain people and keep them entertained throughout the duration of the film, i know it kept me entertained and i enjoyed it.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The best Indy movie yet.
","As a man on a quest for the 'perfect' movie this was not it, but it was indeed one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. I am an avid lover of all the Indiana Jones movies this was definitely the best of the 4. It was fantastic from beginning to end. Everybody who enjoys good movies should see this. As the same with the other Indiana Jones movies this one follows the same format. Indiana with a sidekick and woman in tow goes to find an archaeological treasure of importance. The difference between this movie and the others is that this time there is a father-son aspect that was not present in the others and this was a brilliant move on part of the producers and director Steven Spielberg. It really added something new that was not there before and it added new possibilities for humor which they cashed in on with great reward. Again this was a fantastic movie and people should see it.
