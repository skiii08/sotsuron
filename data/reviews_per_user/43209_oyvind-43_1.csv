Requiem for a Dream," Excellent and scary entertainment! 10 of 10!
","On of the best movies I ever seen!! 10/10! Excellent and scary entertainment! This movie is now 8 years old (2008). I can't believe that i have missed this movie when it came out. In fact i had never heard of it. I purchased the move because Jennifer Connelly was in it. I remembered a young Jennifer doing a great acting in the phenomena, and wanted to see her act years later. I had no expectations to the movie, but as the minutes progress in the move it surprised me more and more. The movie is different, and maybe original. It's one of the best movies i ever seen. The plot is used before, and everybody knows the story about drugs, and how bad it is. But this movie really show you the reality, it's shows you that there is no happy ending using drugs! The movie are powerful and emotional. The acting is great! Jennifer Connelly does a great acting performance, I know she was Nominated for some movie awards, but she did not win any. That I don't understand! She deserved to win something. Another actor who is also doing a good job is, Ellen Burstyn, acting as an addicted on pills and almost crazy woman. She is a great actor. She also played in The Exorcist.",10,0,0,22 April 2008
