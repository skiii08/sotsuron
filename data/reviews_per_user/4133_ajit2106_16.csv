Despicable Me 2," A fun ride_ not great but entertaining
","The first part was about Gru, a rather unsuccessful villain, who cultivates himself into a loving father in the course of the film. In the second part there are all those elements that made the first part such a good film. But now these elements are weighted differently. There is one rule: More Minions at any price. That means there are only a few allusions to other films (For example, the homage to Star Wars Episode 2), the story is less exciting and Gru is not that substantial, but the Minions get more space to unfold.The story of Gru and his children is no longer as interesting and touching, not so strong too, but who bothers. Actually the story of Gru and his children was indeed told in the first part. Although this also means that the story of 'Despicable 2 ¨ is not as exciting, but this film was incredibly funny.The best thing is that the minions work wonderfully as role models. This may be because that they are presented as minimalist as it could have been. All information has been conveyed by gestures and facial expressions. Simultaneously, the Minions are very easy knit and behave like children. This is always something going on, we forgive them every stupidity, and it includes these little creatures straight to his heart. 'Despicable Me 2 ' is considered a work of evolution , if you really want to give a correct term to the film, as it is a sort of next step in the first film, which was , however, already important issues such as parental responsibility and the problem of children orphans.Themes like love, the desire to build a family and friendship are treated with a certain maturity, thanks to the valuable work of the writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio.The graphics and animations are one of the strong elements of the film and it is a true pleasure for the eyes. Somehow even the music manages to carve out as a living in the movie.In terms of the narrative, the film is beautiful and engaging, in some respects even exciting, great to spend an evening in total relaxation.From the beginning until the final sequences are witnessing a great 'show' that manages to entertain the paying public in an efficient manner , but this is still a feature of the new generation of cartoon in which the U.S. we are accustomed in recent years .'Despicable Me 2' is further proof that the U.S. animated family film works quite well , and it is an industry that still manages to dazzle the viewer with fantastic stories and lovable characters.(7.4 / 10)",7,1,1,23 October 2013
Gravity," 'Gravity' is one hell of a ride..
","The excellent staging is impressive and disturbing influenced by the strong acting performance by Sandra Bullock. Impressive, especially when you she was not the first choice for the role of Dr. Ryan Stone considering.For the physician, Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) it is the first trip in space. It is with the crew of the shuttle in the orbit Explorer to install a new module on the Hubble Space Telescope. She is with the experienced astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). Shortly before the completion of their work for outdoor use, the Explorer receives the message from Mission Control in Houston, that in a test, a Russian satellite was destroyed. The resulting debris destroyed in a chain reaction of other satellites.The resulting debris field races with more than 35,000 kilometers per hour around the Earth in an orbit that crosses the Explorer. Stone and Kowalski are warned but they do have time to react. What remains is the flight to the International Space Station before their oxygen runs out – it begins the struggle for survival.Due to the deafening silence they know that they have lost contact with the ground ... and thus any chance of rescue. Their fear turns into panic, while every breath reduced their small supply of oxygen.Alfonso Cuaron delivers one of the best films of recent times in which the presentation, the narrative pulse, sound design, installation, photography, everything seems close to the perfection. Stunning images, captivating atmosphere, dramatic events, and all perfectly accompanied by harmonious sounds. No symbols, metaphors, and messages tucked inside the story that asks the audience to interpret themselves.However, if someone is hoping a futuristic space adventure with plenty of action, will surely be disappointed. 'Gravity' is quiet but fascinating, credible and genuine because we get to understand that space is beautiful and cruel at the same time. It is a visually stunning sci-fi drama with grandiose and impressive 3D effects. Most small movements are choreographed and performed with the utmost care, because in many cases the actors as a kind of puppet supported to convey the illusion of weightlessness.If cinema is a visual media, I think this is the best example we will encounter of this wonder of cinema. The photography by of Emmanuel Lubezki and the music by Steven Price enrich the visual nuances.With 91 minutes of runtime,' Gravity' is extremely short, Alfonso Cuarón focused on a dense narrative that fascinates the first few minutes rather than unnecessary points to draw the story in the length, as soon as the danger is noticeable it grabs the attention and seamlessly goes until the end.",8,2,4,15 October 2013
Fight Club," A cinematic Tour de force- Metamorphosis
","I think this is one of the best mystery-thriller movie ever made in the world.

Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," A biopic deserves accolades- made with conviction......
","We have seen 'Paan Singh Tomar'; a biopic of an Army Sportsman turned a Dacoit, which was critically acclaimed and commercially successful too. It is very good to see the lives of iconic and distinguished personalities on the silver screen.After 'Aks', 'Rang De Basanti' and 'Delhi 6', the tremendously endowed Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra presents a biopic BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG, based on the life of legendary athlete Milkha Singh, nicknamed 'The Flying Sikh'.It is real great cinematic experience; it shows the utmost contemplation and researches. Kudos for Mehra's great effort and Prasoon Joshi's incredible writing, it urges every spectator to salute the sprinter and makes a mark on our hearts.BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG depicts the life of Milka Singh from his childhood tragedy to the achievement and becoming an iconic figure in Indian History. The pain of religious riots during the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan is illustrated through Milkha's eye that we can feel the horror of the catastrophe, orphaned Milka and his elder sister struggling to meet the ends and Milkha doing odd jobs (Burglary, looting coal from trains etc.). After much of the struggle, impediments, apprehensions, he found his athletic calling in the army, eventually setting 400-meter world records and representing India at the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. The best part is Milkha Singh helped the creators in weaving the story and writer justified it. The writing never goes over the top; not it has the clichéd segments. It captures the every required detail and nuance. It never loses the focus from the credentials of Milkha's renowned career.The razor sharp editing puts all the pieces together as if it has been shot like chronologically. Mehra sure has an ear for the perfect musical score and we can listen to the exhilarating background score situation by situation, moments by moments. Cinematography is a real pleasure to watch, it is shot beautifully and it soothes the eyes.Farhan Khan as 'Milkha Singh' is remarkable; the effort invested by him is praiseworthy as he morphed himself completely to the character of Milkha Singh. His chiseled athletic physique, the long hair, the body language and the dialog delivery. , Farhan has pushed himself beyond limits to illustrate the eminent and renowned character of Milkha Singh with precision. He leaves no stone unturned, we really admire the conviction, commitment and sincerity of the actor. This is an immaculate and unforgettable performance.Pawan Malhotra is impeccable. Cricketer Yuvraj Singh's actor-father Yograj Singh shines as Farhan's coach. Prakash Raj, cast in a positive role, is notable with a lovely mustache.Overall, BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is another feather in the cap on Indian Cinema. We are waiting for more..8.1/10",7,0,0,16 September 2013

The Intouchables," Palpable- An example of great cinema and friendship
","A movie with real life emotions and sentiments, one of the greatest comedies ever:Based on a true story, an opulent man Philippe (François Cluzet), quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, hires a full mouthed and frivolous Driss (Omar Sy) as 24/7 caretaker because he is completely disabled from neck to toe. Driss joins Phillipe reluctantly as he does not want a job, just a signature that he has attended the interview. It begins there uncanny friendship leading to lifelong union. The scriptwriting is absolutely remarkable as the development of their friendship is at its best without taking unnecessary screen time. The friends and well-wishers of Philippe contradict with his decision to accompany Driss and Philippe has decided that he will not listen to anyone and his decision is firm. The moments between Driss and Magalie (Audrey Fleurot) are hilarious. The great thing which works here is the chemistry between the leads; it has the utmost tangibility and mutual responsibility.François Cluzet is always wonderful but this time as a disabled man he is just perfect, Omar Sy is extremely wonderful as a garrulous and full of life person.The supporting cast has done their job magnificently, which makes the movie and amazing experience of relationships and bonds. No wonder, 'The Intouchables' became the second most successful French film. Highly recommended. 9/10",9,1,2,25 May 2012
Drive," Drive - A Stylish, compelling, impeccable and an imaginative art-house thriller
","Having watched, Nicolas Winding Refn's Pusher Trilogy, Valhalla Rising, Bleeder and Bronson, I must admit that he has brilliant sense of cinema making and it shows in the every frame of his movies. 'Drive' is an illustration of the finest cinema with top notch style and proclamation. Technical Specs are impeccable, you will be amazed with contemplative long shots and slow motion zooms. Drive is an immaculately made film, filled with beautiful cinematography.Set in the 1980s, Drive tells the story of stunt driver (Ryan Gosling) with no name who works as a driver for money in the night for Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks). Eventually, he (the driver) finds himself infatuated with his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and befriends with her son Benicio (Kaden Leos). He tries to help Irene's husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) to pay his debts, but engulfs himself into a wrong path, now the driver has to shield Irene and her son from the gangsters.The entire cast has been selected sensibly which gives a variety of performers to live the screenplay. All the supporting actors like Bryan Cranston, Christina Hendricks, Albert Brooks deliver and Ron Perlman have delivered the top notch performances. Carrey Mulligan had proved her caliber previously and this role is no exception. Ryan Gosling is undoubtedly proved himself in every role he has done so far as he is one of the brightest star of modern cinema. Ryan Gosling performance as a smiling, serene and cool driver with subtleness is just unforgettable, and the character's transitions from a serene person to a violent avenger is just unsullied.The soundtrack is fresh and gives soul to the film which makes it extraordinary.Recommended for every movie lover, it shouldn't be missed.My Vote 9/10",9,1,4,25 December 2011
3 Idiots," Admirably congenial
","Three Idiots is a prototype of the best Indian Comedies. It has its own aroma and quintessence with some wonderful acting and moral values.Above all it is Amir Khan who plays a teenager's role and that is quite miraculous. Look at his body language, a 44 Year Old man is portraying a teenage but it is Amir the maestro. Madhvan is exquisite as Farhan with affliction of expectations of becoming an Engineer. Sharman Joshi is an innate humorist with his home shown in Black & White, her mother itching his father's chest with rolling-pin while rolling chapati, 'Absolutely Hilarious'. Kareena looks whimsical as a doctor and beloved of rancho, she does a good job. Omi Vaidya is just magical as Chatur and makes you laugh your ass off with his BALATKAAR speech. Boman Irani as VIRUS is fantastic as always.Although it is based on Chetan Bhagat's 'Five Point Someone' but the movie has its own implication and character set up. This is a must watch movie and it is Raju Hirani who is giving thought to the people with his social communication. This is a great piece of cinema to the Indian History.",9,1,3,21 July 2011
Pulp Fiction," A complete cinema
","When we talk about Cinema, 'Pulp Fiction' defines the Cinema.One of the best movies ever made. You will love to watch it 1000 times and still crave for some more viewings.It starts up again the non-linear story telling after Short Cuts (1993) with three stories entwined and told in a whimsical fashion.You will listen to and understand the real rhetorical skill. The conversation has the power to evoke a sense of sentence construction be it complex or compound with entangled profanity.Each and every character has its own emblem and leaves a stamp on your heart forever.The violence and mayhem depicted is of has the highest value and set a standard, it looks definitive with sheer use of perfect camera angles.Quentin Tarantino has a different mechanism or technical aspects of doing something wonderfully; he will always be appreciated for his work. 'In fact Quentin is Genre'.A masterpiece which will remain in your hearts and minds whenever we converse about Cinema.",9,0,3,2 September 2011
Inception," Inception...A challenge to the imminent cinema
","Inception itself suggests the beginning of something and for what Christopher Nolan is renowned.This is an example of the litheness of dream, where you can find yourself somewhere on the globe without knowing the path. Christopher Nolan has proved it once again after 'The Following' 'Memento', 'The Prestige' , 'The Dark Night' that he is here for the makeover of the contemporary cinema.Inception is surreal and Nolan used incongruous juxtapositions in order to represent unconscious thoughts and dreams. The dominion of surrealism is unidentified and tenuous, when we endeavor to concoct it, the aftermath can go off beam.This movie displays the ahead of its time planet where we can intercept human minds through dream foray and we can make them alter their mental picture. Leonardo Dicaprio plays the role flawlessly and effortlessly as he is one of finest actors. He blatantly gets into the character and exhibits the real intricacies and restrictions of Cobb. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has an embellishing screen presence, Ken Watanabe is excellent and Ellen Page is not lost among the stars. Marion Cotillard is wonderful depicting her pain and mental suffering as, Mal.Nolan's is unsurpassed and exceptionally creative,Inception is an epitome of his brilliance.",9,1,6,21 July 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," The Best Movie ever made in the history of the Cinema
","Have you ever thought analytically, why this movie is called the best movie ever made? I don't know but i want to watch it infinite times because it has the power which will eloquently argue with you.The story tells you about Andy, a wrongfully accused person sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. How can he find redemption from the Shawshank Prison? How will he survive the cruelty and extreme heartlessness in the prison? Will he be able to see the world of outside the prison? It is all about the hope: Intend with some possibility of fulfillment. This movie has both aspect of life i.e. agony and ecstasy. It will give you an impression that nothing is impossible if you have hope and willpower.Very well acted by Tim Robbins as a silent and soft spoken person, who has a lot to say from his eyes. Morgan Freeman as Red narrated the story brilliantly and given the best performance of his life. I loved the character of James Whitmore as 'Brook' which defines the effect of an automatic pattern of behavior in reaction to a specific situation; may be inherited or acquired through frequent repetition. It is heart-wrenching and overwhelming.Bob Gunton is ruthless and his immoderately desirous of acquiring wealth is fantastic as warden Norton.Rita Hayworth's poster says a lot of things which is ineffable.A great movie with great cast because you will never forget a character of this movie.A movie for every movie watcher in the world. 10/10",10,0,0,2 September 2011
The Croods," A journey through a brightly colored world and relationships
","The DreamWorks Animation this time seems to want to go beyond itself in order to succeed and has invented prehistoric era full of references to the current one without aping 'The Flintstones'.The Croods family consists of six members living in the last Stone Age family. They live in a cave and exit only in daylight, because in the darkness, it hides too much risk. The rebellious teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) hates life behind the stones and therefore opposes one night her father Grug's (Nicolas Cage) instructions. She leaves the cave and meets the Guy (Ryan Reynolds), a boy of the same age who can make fire. She learns that the earth will soon be destroyed and you can still find survival only in the direction of the sun from him. Shortly after-wards the Cave of the Croods is destroyed, they have no choice but to find a new home.Together with Guy they embark on a journey into the unknown and witness for the first time the world outside their stone dwelling. It goes through a colorful landscape, peppered with never seen before fanciful animals and many adventures. Only Papa Grug has a problem with the Guys because he has many ideas and innovation which overshadow Grug, but it eventually, it is replaced by Guy as a leader. However, sometimes we sense the personal feelings queued up in order to survive.We all know that every woman loves shoes. But it is heavenly to see how the Stone Eep girls can enjoy their first pair of boots and when it is handmade by a smart boy of the same age. What women want? The prehistoric 3D animated film The Croods is made by DreamWorks and directed by Christopher Sanders (How to Train Your Dragon) and Kirk DeMicco (Quest for Camelot). The animated adventure shows, just like the predecessor from the think tank of DreamWorks (Shrek, Madagascar, it again are the big ideas of the makers not only in inventing stories, but also in the creation of fantastic worlds and whimsical characters.The story is not only about survival, but about life, relationships and the experience of life with all its adventures. In the foreground of course there is a family and their lovable characters that are not always dissimilar to our own, with all their idiosyncrasies and quirks. So in the Stone Age too, one has to deal with adolescent problems, or catty granny. But it's also the way for each other to cohesion, mutual aid and taking responsibility for intelligence and the beginning of civilization. Lots of nice ideas, sloping figures and lovable animals like piranhas or a feathered rainbow colored giants cat à la Alice in Wonderland there is to admire. Many brightly colored scenes reminiscent of the immersion in the alien world of Avatar. With all the vividness of the film we sometimes surprised by the absolute silence, which is rather unusual for an animated film.It really is great fun to watch the Croods with all its endearing quirks and their whimsical environment in which they are looking for a new home. Actually, you do not want to quit gazing, there are too many beautiful things to discover and above all, heartily to laugh at.7.5/10...",7,0,0,18 September 2013
Rockstar," Rockstar- Poignant and one of a kind with soulful music and Ranbir's noble performance
","Rockstar is an enchantment to watch that how Indian Cinema is up-and-coming with some different subject matter.Janardan Jakhad(JJ) a regular lad with vehemence for rock music and die-hard fan of Jim Morrison goes to an indistinct length. He was recommended by his mentor that to become an eminent artist there must have occurred a catastrophe and pain deep in heart. The efforts to break his heart are very funny with some witty dialogs and great body language by Ranbir. Eventually Nargis Fakhri's screen presence is a cool breeze, she is striking but lacks in the acting skills. She missed the expressions and unable to deliver nevertheless having a counterpart role. The supporting cast has done very well, special mention for Kumud Mishra (Katara) & Piyush Mishra (Dhingra).The first half of the movie shows the character development of JJ with some fine moments of mirth and splendid cinematography. However, the second half drags a bit with some no obvious reason deeds. Ranbir adds a new feather is his cap with outstanding performance. He shows a great potential in every movie with a different shade. He is going to take the Kapoor's legacy to a whole new level. Ultimately, the Music, given by our own Oscar winner A R Rahman, is exceptional and soul of the movie. Every score is blazing with the correct situation. Rahman is a genius and kudos for compiling such stupendous music which will remain in our hearts until the world ends. Imtiaz Ali has given us some fantastic movies including his best (My Opinion) SOCHA NA THA and with Rockstar he chooses a very fine and daring subject. Waiting to see more from him!Music-9.5/10 Acting (Ranbir)-8/10 Story-6/10 DIRECTION & CINEMATOGRAPHY-7/10Film - 7.5/10",8,4,5,20 November 2011
