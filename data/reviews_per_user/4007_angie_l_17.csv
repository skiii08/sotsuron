Black Swan," Mediocre
","This review may contain... WILL contain spoilers. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't good either. Usually after watching a psychological thriller, I am left disturbed for a few days and pondering the movie. I continually am trying to figure out the characters and their motivations - even when I don't like the movie. Here, I am left indifferent. The movie is pretty obvious in what it says and in the end feels quite empty. I recommend reading Mikelepost's review.The movie is about repressing your dark side, which Nina (Natalie Portman) has done and I'm assuming that's why she has cracked. She wears pink while everyone else wears black, she is perfect for the white swan but not the black swan. First problem, though, is Nina is already teetering on the edge and has been for quite some time now. This reduces the tension the movie can achieve and any surprise when given a reveal. She was suppose to have ALREADY dealt with her self-mutilating problems but still is scratching herself - in case you didn't get it, that's why she always has blood on her finger tips. This already unstable wacko is then picked to be the lead in swan lake. Why? Because as we see through the prior prima ballerina, Beth (Winona Ryder), the director Thomas (Vinent Cassel) likes his primary dancers with a healthy dose of crazy. Nina's struggle with her repressed dark side/black swan comes to a head from the pressure of dancing the lead and the introduction of Lily, the free-spirited Californian who embraces her dark side. Lily begins to manifest in Nina's brain as a representation of her own dark side. (Helpful hint if you missed it - The sex scene between them is clearly imagined since when Nina and Lily walk into her apartment, their reflections in the mirror behind them are split as if the two people are really one.) Has Nina repressed her sexuality because she has lesbian tendencies? Another potential idea that is not explored.That's the setup and here's the breakdown... The first hour of the movie is boring with little action or plot other than some Nina doppelgangers. Winona Ryder's character is near pointless. Some, umm a lot, of the dialogue, especially everything Lily says is poorly written and a lil cheesy at times. Most characters are one-dimensional - OK it's Swan Lake but no other character is explored - I thought Vincent Cassel's character had no sexual interest in Nina and was just trying to drive her a little mad to pull the performance out of her. Even appointing Kunis as her understudy because he knew it would rattle Nina. Also, it seems Nina is more interested in Cassel but the 'hot for teacher' aspect that gets hinted at in the beginning goes no where and I thought these were missed opportunities and potential for an actual plot as there really was none. There is little to no dancing. Nina finally perfects the Black Swan, on the night of the performance mind you, and all you see of it is crazy eyes and a couple of twirls - some crowning achievement. The whole point of the delving into the dark side and you don't get to see its release. As for Portman's Oscar win - I am OK with it. To me, her acting is always wooden and here it is the same but perfectly suits the character Nina. The reason for her visions go unexplained and have no significance other than she goes outside of herself when she is scratching. There is no complexity to the movie or the one-dimensional characters, everything is pretty much right on the surface. What happened to our sweet little girl Nina? She really was the clepto black swan that convinced the world she was the white swan and I am still indifferent. I also agree with the reviewer who said, the whole creative process of the movie was done by men, men who still think women are either the repressed virgin or the whore. This contributed to the lack of depth in any character. It was a good idea with good visuals but the screenplay needed some work.EDIT: I also didn't see the mother as over-bearing as most did. Was the mom a little too much and not necessarily fully sane herself? Sure, however, I felt the mother knew her daughter wasn't mentally well. Her constantly checking her body was to make sure she wasn't mutilating herself again and she also repeatedly said the lead role was too much for Nina. It seemed mom knew that Nina's psyche would crack under the stress and it did. So there must have been some prior break-down's in Nina's life. Again though, in a movie that was painfully obvious, the minor characters intentions are so subtle to the point of incomprehensible.",5,3,5,9 April 2011
Memento," Brilliant Movie
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I have heard it compared to Last Year at Marienbad but other than both movies being a study in memory, the two really aren't similar. I highly recommend this movie.I find it hard to review movies that I love. The movie tells a rather simple story. What is brilliant here is how it tells that story. Part of the story is told backwards but the brilliance isn't just that goes backwards. Each scene tells you something new about the story that leads you to think one thing. Then you get to see the scene that came before and find you learn your previous assumption was wrong. This constant misdirection actually makes the movie so interesting and intriguing to watch. It is just a wonderful cinematic experience.",9,0,2,8 February 2012
Concussion," Watch PBS's 'League of Denial' instead
","I wanted to like this movie. I know a lot of people who may not sit through a documentary but probably would sit through a good movie. I was hoping this would connect with them. However, this movie is a bit long-winded and boring. The movie was 2 hours long but it felt like it was 3.I felt like they tried to really stick to the facts but it didn't have that much of a dramatic impact. It was boring and little held my interest and this is a topic I am interested in. Some of the interludes of Omalu's personal life felt a little too long or unnecessary. I kind of wished the movie had layered in more of the football players' lives and their degenerating mental health as opposed to just a few scenes peppered in here or there. Maybe, even see some more of the NFL's denial of the seriousness of head injuries over the years. Even though the story is focused on the struggle of Dr. Omalu, exploring the NFL's denial and the players' realities more would have strengthened and added more depth to the movie as a whole - who is he fighting for? And, who/what is he fighting against? Even the racism and xenophobia that Dr. Omalu faced as an outsider taking down the USA's favorite sport was mostly just flat out stated. Basically, the script needed a very deft hand to weave it all together in an informative, real, and compelling way.Some of the acting was a little wonky. Will Smith is poorly cast as Dr. Omalu. Smith's accent ended up more as a stereotypical generic African accent. Other than the accent issues, his acting was fine in the role (and the Academy has not only nominated but has given Oscars to worse) but, and I put this in part on the director, I hated how leaky-eyed and lifeless Omalu was portrayed.Last season, when football kicked off, PBS simultaneously ran a documentary about CTE called 'League of Denial.' I highly recommend it. It was much more informative and interesting than this movie.",6,1,2,9 April 2016
Lost in Translation," There was nothing to translate.
","Again, critics convince people that a bad movie is art. I like slow movies and can handle little to no dialogue but this one has little meaning and I had no emotional connection to the story or the characters. I spent most of the movie thinking, I'm missing something. I was convinced I didn't get it, there's something deeper going on. Then I started reading the reviewers who liked it in hopes to understand what I had missed and realized, I hadn't missed anything at all.The story is about a young recently married Yale graduate, Charlotte(Scarlett Johansson), whose husband is a successful photographer, John (Ribisi). Her husband's job has taken them to Tokyo. She is bored and alienated and spends most her time staring out her expensive hotel window. Charlotte is unsure of her future and life choices. You feel her and her husband have little connection to the point of why did they even get married in the first place? John seems to connect more with an American actress. They connect over superficial conversation but our heroine is quiet and introspective and therefore 'deep.' This makes Charlotte more worthy - can you hear the sarcasm. The petty conversation of her husband and the actress bore her because she was a philosophy major, you know. However, Charlotte, this deep and educated woman, can't seem to find anything interesting to do in a lush and vibrant city.Bob (Bill Murray) is an aging actor(?) in a mid-life crisis and has a stale marriage. He is in Tokyo to make some TV commercials. He feels as alone and alienated as Charlotte. They meet and since Charlotte is not much for talking and neither is Bob, especially not about superficial stuff of course, they have an immediate connection. They spend the next few days hanging out and enjoying the night life. Two bored miserable people of a certain amount of privilege seeking more meaningful lives find each other by going bar-hopping and smoking weed. Not much happens and these deep people who have the power to see the world more truthfully and identify the pointless crap basically mock the Japanese. I won't say it was racist but the feeling like a foreigner in a strange land was only partially realized. All new lands have strange cultures, sure, but combined with all the Japanese people presented as inane, smiling, and eager bordered on offensive.I found the characters evoked little sympathy. They were as bland as the story, or non-story, that was told. The movie is boring and slow to the point of unbearable. I don't know what people liked? I'm guessing Hollywood enjoyed a movie that made a relationship with a 30 year age gap somewhat believable and told us it was not out of shallowness but a 'deep' connection. Perhaps having Coppola as your last name doesn't hurt when people are voting for the Oscars.",1,16,30,23 January 2012
The Revenant," Brilliant Directing Made a Bad Script Bearable
","Spoilers Galore, consider yourself warned! When I saw Birdman, also written and directed by Inarritu, I thought it was great. It was a stylish and interesting movie experience. However, I was left feeling something was missing, which prevented it from entering 'favorite' status, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was. After seeing the Revenant, I realized what Inarritu lacks. His direction, while skillful, is cold. Emotion, which in Birdman isn't needed to carry the script, is missing here and it hurts the story.First, the movie could have been edited down by a half to a full hour. The scenery is beautiful but does every shot need to linger so long? The story is about revenge and survival. However, I found the whole script to be dull and lacking. The conversations are bland and if not for Inarritu's skill as a director, the movie would be unwatchable, unbearable even.Hugh Glass, DiCaprio, is the main character and the guide to a fur trapping expedition. His Native American wife was murdered years before and he was left alone to care for their son. His son, now a teenager, is on the fur expedition with him. The expedition is lead by Captain Henry, Gleeson, and the villain John, Hardy, is also a member of the party. John opposes almost all of Glass's decisions at every turn.When we meet the expedition, they are quickly descended upon by a group of Native Americans. The scene is brutal but well directed The struggle to survive is well captured but the scene goes on a bit long. We later learn the Native Americans are looking for the Chief's daughter, Powaqa, who has been kidnapped. My issue is the Native Americans just start shooting with no questions asked at all 'English' men because the French, who actually have the girl, told them that's who took her. They aren't even worried that she might be accidentally killed in the fray. I get it, Inarritu wants this world to be as merciless as possible but sometimes it went beyond reason. Some of the members of the expedition manage to survive the attack. Glass comes up with a new path to avoid another attack and return to their fort. But, Glass is viciously attacked by a bear in one of the most skillfully directed scenes possibly ever. Glass 's condition is dire but he clings to life. As they continue on their difficult return course, it becomes apparent they won't be able to carry the injured Glass up the mountain. At first, the leader, Captain Henry, debates putting Glass out of his misery. In an unforgiving land, Capt. Henry is more sentimental and takes a more noble path and offers money to those willing to stay with Glass until he passes. John, Bridger - a nice young man - and Glass's son, Hawk, stay.John has always felt that they should euthanize Glass. So, when the two young men are gone, he offers Glass a mercy death. Glass eventually agrees. Hawk comes upon John while he is doing the deed and freaks out. In the scuffle, John kills Hawk as Glass lays helpless watching. You already dislike John but there really isn't enough character development for you to feel completely devastated by Hawk's death.... and that's a major problem in a revenge story. Plus, it took an hour to get to this point - an hour to establish the setup and it still lacked the necessary emotional punch. By the time any chance of revenge comes, you feel just as worn out as Glass and it doesn't really matter any more - which in some ways was the point of the movie even if it failed to fully realize that..Moving on. John makes it back to the fort with Bridger who is ignorant to everything. And, for the next hour or more, we watch Glass miraculously survive through some impossible situations like falling off a cliff. Glass meets another man whose family has also been killed but he decided to leave revenge in God's hands. Finally, Glass is found by the those at the Fort. At this point, you're not sure who has been more tortured, Glass or you, the viewer.When they return, John has taken all of the money from the safe, we don't know how he managed this, and ran off. Here comes some unbelievable aspects, Glass and Henry decide to go after John alone. Two men, that's it? This is to setup 2 aspects of the forced ending: 1) Glass can pretend to be dead on the horse for a cool scene. 2) Glass can let go of his revenge. Except, after a lengthy savage duel, Glass has his chance to fulfill his revenge but his companion's words echo in his head to leave it to God. So, he does by letting him drift down the river... which would be a good ending if that left John with Glass's fate – injured and lost in the wilderness with nothing but it's not. Glass had previously saved Powaqa and those same Native Americans are coincidentally 60 feet down river. John floats to them and they kill him. Is that really leaving it to God's hands? Or letting someone else do the dirty deed as you watch? How about more simply, Captain Henry gathers a group of men to catch John, he has to abandon his belongings including the money to run away. As they risk more perils, Glass sees the futility and talks Capt. Henry into standing down, to leave it to God.Other notes, Hardy is a good actor but here he sounded like he had a huge wad of cotton stuck in his mouth . Inarritu deserved the best directing Oscar despite how bad the movie was. Lastly, there a bunch of dream sequences that involved Glass's wife that I felt added little to the story. DiCaprio's Oscar is well deserved.",1,3,8,14 March 2016
Doctor Zhivago," A Major Part of the Story is Missing.
","Honestly, this movie made me feel like I was wandering the Russian tundra.Anyway, I was initially excited to finally see this movie. However, by the time it got to the intermission, I debated giving up on it. The biggest problem with the whole script, the reason why the movie lacks any drive, any momentum, any tension, is because the heart of the story is missing. Dr. Zhivago's marriage to Tonya is one of love and friendship but she's supposedly not his true love. Then, Zhivago spends 6 months with the gorgeous Lara and falls in love. However, the movie skips from him arriving at his post and seeing Lara again to him leaving and them already in love. We don't see their relationship grow, develop, unfold. It's a gaping hole in the middle of the movie. On top of that, their affair is purely emotional at this point and not physical which if we saw their relationship develop, it would actually build tension. Their love story was critical to, at least, my emotional involvement in the plot. Without seeing what was so enthralling about Lara, you kind of feel like what was he missing from the pretty and sweet Tonya?There are parts of the movie worthy praise especially on a technical front. However, the movie was ultimately long and boring.",6,1,2,1 April 2016
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Dull
","Dull as dishwater and kills the meaning and intentions of the book, Stieg Larsson is rolling in his grave. Dull, Dull, Dull... The book was originally called 'Men Who Hate Women.' Stieg Larsson, the author, was adamant that the name not be change. Sadly he died before he could complain about the renaming of translations. The book is a strong statement about violence against women which is somewhat watered down in favor of more typical cinema.My biggest problem was how they wrote Lisbeth Salander. In the book at one point, Blomkvist actually thinks she may be some form of high functioning autism, I didn't get that from this Salander. Movie Lisbeth was a girl who had just been hardened by going through a lot of crap and is a bit walled off and lacking social niceties but still has a level of normalcy. Book Lisbeth is exceptionally awkward, even more closed off and much harder, even militant. Blomkvist never finds out Lisbeth is a ward of the state in the first book. In fact Lisbeth would never tell anybody this fact about herself, she is very guarded of this secret. So her laying in bed talking about it with Blomkvist would never have happened. That is a far too normal an interaction for Salander. To make the scene worse, he asks why she's a ward and she tells him about setting her father on fire when she was young. Again, another guarded secret she would never talk about. If you were thinking of reading the books, major spoiler alert, her lighting her daddy ablaze is actually the big reveal at the end of book 2, The Girl who Played with Fire. Another problem is the end scene where Lisbeth asks, 'May I kill him?' Some reviewers were disappointed seeing this as Lisbeth being passive to Blomkvist which is a big problem since the book is quite feminist but I didn't see it that way. What I did see was Lisbeth deferring to Blomkvist out of respect: she values Blomkvist more than hunting down Martin. In the book she just says I am going to kill him and takes off before Blomkvist can say a word: killing Martin is more important than anything. While I wanted to understand book Lisbeth, movie Lisbeth drew little intrigue.They took out how some of Blomkvist's exploits. I wonder how people would have perceived the movie differently if he was shown having an affair with Cecilia Vanger. The crime story is the plot of the novel but not what drives it. The character's drive the story. The mystery really wasn't that exciting to read about. Since it wasn't that exciting to read about, it was even less interesting to watch. It's just not a riveting story line and not what I took away from the book. The problem is the character's here lacked the depth and complexity to carry the movie as they did in the book. Some of the important character interactions are also cut for the so-so crime story.The Wennerstrom affair was incomprehensible. We hardly know why Blomkvist got convicted of libel and little insight into him taking down Wennerstrom in the end. Also the tangent where Lisbth stealing billions in Wennerstrom's Kronor is too long and serves little purpose. It could have been done more carefully in far fewer scenes. (Lisbeth asking for the money from Blomkvist and then Blomkvist seeing her on TV in the blond wig (which in the book he sees her on TV, recognizes her and knows she stole the money) would be enough.).To make the movie work, they needed to be more adept at stream-lining the plot. In the end, it amounted to an incredibly boring movie that was often incomprehensible. Dull, dull, dull, that's all I seem to be able to say about this movie.",5,4,6,27 October 2012
Inside Out," Too Cerebral without an Entertaining Enough Story
","Just based on the movie, it deserves a rating of a 4 or 5 but I'm giving it 6 stars because of its intellectual aspect.I was so excited to see this film. I missed it in theaters and didn't get to see it in 3D so I'm not sure what that would add to the movie. I am a Pixar lover but this one was a major disappointment. On some levels, the movie is amazing and the writers obviously did a lot of research and carefully laid out their story - so much to the movie is brilliant. How what is happening inside of Riley's (the main character) brain and how it affects what she is doing 'outside' is seamless. The sections of the brain like memory and imagination are wonderful. The whole aspect of how suppressing emotions affects us is great. However, while the representation of the inner workings of the brain in a fun way that is accessible to children was exceptional, it didn't translate into an interesting story. (By accessible to children, I mean even if they didn't understand it, they wouldn't be confused by it either.) The story is just OK, a bit boring actually. The goal of the movie wasn't to be a laugh-fest but I also didn't get the emotional connection needed to sustain it either. Also, the cast was great.I still give a major kudos to Pixar for attempting such a layered film with so much potential. Intellectually, I appreciated the effort of trying to give us a children's movie with so much depth. Unfortunately, the end result was mediocre.",6,2,19,14 March 2016
Bridesmaids," Should NOT have been called Bridesmaids and was NOT funny.
","When I first saw the trailers for this movie, I thought it was going to be bad but then the movie got so much hype and some nominations. When I saw the movie, it was worse than what my first impressions were. The movie didn't know if it wanted to be a somewhat serious comedy or just ridiculous shenanigans. First problem, it forgot to be funny. There were parts that were mildly funny but the humor felt forced. The movie spent too much time on crude fart, vomit, diarrhea, and sex jokes - this is a bridal party we are talking about? Was the point just to prove that the girls can be as disgusting as the guys? Some scenes were quite serious about Annie's (Kristen Wiig) life and those made scenes like her stabbing the cookie and ruining the chocolate fountain unnecessary and over the top. The scene where Wiig and Byrne are trying to get the cops attention felt like a bad SNL skit that just didn't end and you're feeling embarrassed for the comedians acting it out. She could've drove by twice and had it actually be funny, we didn't need ten times. The length of each scene killed all potential humor.Kristen Wiig's character draws little sympathy. She hit her low but we didn't see her before she falls so we are only left with someone rather snarky and unlikable. She wasn't even a good friend, she couldn't sacrifice a little to make her friends wedding go smoothly. It could have been funny if Wiig was biting her tongue until she explodes. Lastly, the plot just didn't bring much around. I was invested in all of the bridesmaids not just Wiig, though I didn't like any of them, not even Megan (Meliss McCarthy). The beginning of the movie spent time setting up the other bridesmaids such as the newly wed and the miserable wife and their story lines go nowhere. Annie could have been the main character working through her crisis and we could have seen growth in the other bridesmaids around her and a sense of comradery and bonding ensues. I thought it was bridesmaids and not 'maid of honor.' Also why does Megan show up to help Annie? Then Wiig does little to atone but all is forgiven anyway.This movie is just bad on all levels. It tried way too hard to be funny and missed. This movie and its acting should never be nominated for anything, ever! By the way, in a Brazilian restaurant, they should have been greeted as senhorinhas not senoritas.On a personal note: The hype combined with Golden Globe and Oscar nominations got me really excited about Bridesmaids. I was secretly hoping it would be Spinal Tap for bridesmaids. I have been a bridesmaid five times so far and the experience is ripe for comedy and I am sure many others can relate. There are bridal showers (playing inane games for prizes, not to mention how long and boring they are as someone opens predetermined gifts), buying gifts, bachelorette party (Hello!! Women adorning themselves with phallus covered crowns and some dirty games), rehearsal dinner, engagement party, wedding, picking a wedding gown, picking and ordering bridesmaids gowns and pretending you like taffeta, fittings!! (a bridal salon literally made me order a dress three sizes too big because of the size chart and my measurements even though the size in the store fit. Then when the dress came in, it was three sizes too big and I had to pay an extra $100 to get it fitted and it never fits/looks quite right after that), shoes, hair, nails, make-up, and jewelry - now start totaling up the cost of all that. Take these somewhat ridiculous situations and turn the volume up to 11 and you get the potential for a comedic gold mine, the whole custom is dying to be made fun of. I also have to say that being a bridesmaid is all worth it in the end. As much as is can be a hassle at times, it is also a lot of fun. You enjoy being their for your friend or family member on one of the most important days of their lives and are so honored that they chose you to be part it. The joy and the pain of the whole experience wasn't just not captured but completely ignored and this was a big disappointment. It could have been forgiven if the movie was good.",2,5,8,6 February 2012
Children of Men," Says nothing
","Children of Men is about a future in which the human race has lost the ability to reproduce and beyond that doesn't develop any further. The movie tries to ride high on a 'profound' premise but it never comes together with anything to say about that premise.It has been 20 years since the last baby was born and the human race is desperate. The semi-orewllian future is well realized and believable but there is no reason given to why the world has fallen into chaos. A young woman, Kee, is secretly pregnant and people are trying to use her for unknown political reasons. Basically this is where the whole plot comes apart. The movie becomes an action movie and escape from the omnipresent bad guys and that's it.Kee, the pregnant woman, might as well just be cargo that needs to be transported. Even her being called Kee sort of cheapens the plot - Kee as in she is the key to the future. There is no reason for why she was so special to get pregnant or what might have changed that allowed her to do so. There is also no profound idea given in that maybe what's special about her is that she isn't special at all. The movie can't manage to say anything.This is an action movie that is a blank. Just action with a good premise that is never realized. The movie says nothing and doesn't have much of a plot other than random action scenes in which Clive Owen is transporting his cargo. The visuals do make it entertaining but that's it. I think the premise of the movie and the visuals of a bleak future are a smokescreen for a plot and a message and the only reason why anyone actually thinks this movie is good. Entertaining to watch but completely forgettable.",3,11,17,16 February 2010
A Clockwork Orange," Gratuitous violence
","Someone needed to tape my eyes open just so I didn't fall asleep during this movie. If I could give this movie zero stars, I would, no let me take that back, if I could give this movie negative stars I would. The crux of the story is really a question, does being good count if you didn't choose to be good out of your own free will? Everything is quite blunt to the point of literally being stated. Everything is done to the extreme to emphasize the question. You can't just be kind of bad here, you have to be a raving psychotic killer and rapist, no nuance. The simplicity combined with the pacing made the movie quite boring. The question at the center of the movie also didn't fully sing since it is being asked about a psychopath - to me it didn't matter if his motivation for being good is the right one or if his free will has been taken away because his free will should be taken away by the prison system. He shouldn't be allowed back into society. And even what should be the purpose of prison isn't really explored, is it rehabilitation, punishment, or sequestering those unfit to live in society? The question at the heart of the movie would have been more interesting if it were asked about someone who is good only out of fear of say the law or God. Let me add, I know this is a book but I haven't read it. Even without this next complaint, I didn't think the movie was good. This is why I would give it negative stars. What I really hated was how the violence towards women was presented. The rape scenes are quite graphic with out conveying the gravity of situation. They had too much of a light feel and the movie seemed to not just enjoy them at times but revel in them. The first rape scene of a woman just being tossed around as a group of men tear her clothes off verged on comical when it should have been repulsive. I just felt that rape was too serious an issue to be treated so lightly. Not to mention those horrible mannequins (which I could have lived with and maybe even appreciated if the actual women in the movie weren't also just props)? Being a morality play, women are only present as an object of violence. Edit: If you think I'm seeing something that isn't there, Kubrick said how Alex, the main character, 'represents the id, the savage repressed side of our nature which guiltlessly enjoys the pleasures of rape.'",1,62,123,21 January 2012
Thor," It was OK
","Thor was alright. If you want a mindless action movie with a comic hero believably coming to life, you will enjoy it.It started off a bit ridiculous but I gave the movie leeway and suspended disbelief a little further, this is a comic after all - completely forget the Norse Mythology aspect. Once I did that, it had a certain charm. Then Thor is sent to Earth and it started to veer off the tracks and kept straying further and further. Thor's brash arrogance could've played out really adorably on Earth but that part was really short lived. Then Thor has a turn around in a matter of minutes - this transformation could've had its own laughs as we struggle to learn with him. Thor was always good but arrogant to completely noble in 60 seconds? Then the love angle, I am not sure what Thor would see in the Natalie Portman character or vice versa. There is little given here to make their 24 hour romance believable and trust me, I wasn't asking for a lot. Thor's friends show up on Earth for about a minute to then go back. The entire movie was just skimming along. There were also some unbelievable plot twists like the FBI just letting Thor go. Lastly, the cheese factor - again, extra disbelief suspended and so cheese and cliché go with the territory but about half way through, the cheese started spilling over and I couldn't take it any more.It actually exceeded my expectations as I thought it would be truly dreadful but it wasn't. The plot just needed more flesh. The opening sequence is so long and drawn out that it really could've been trimmed down as it was only the set-up and then the plot could have gotten a little more loving.",3,0,2,28 January 2012
Burlesque," Entertaining
","At times I can be a bit snobby about movies. I am more attracted to slow artsy fartsy movies that try make grand points about society or existence. However, not all movies are to meant to challenge social structures or deliver underlying meanings and here there certainly is none of that.... and I liked it! Burlesque is a little cheesy, yup, filled with clichés, uh huh, predictable, you betcha! That is all part of it's charm though. It set out to be a fun romp with some sexy outfits and entertaining song numbers and it delivered. There is no great villain, there is no great backstabbing - which in someways is more realistic. It doesn't try to have an overly deep plot. It knows it's superficial and embraces it. Did anyone ever doubt Christina could sing? Her voice is amazing and her acting ain't bad either. Cher is well, Cher and how can anyone not love her? Stanley Tucci certainly steals the show while Cam Gigandet provides some delicious eye candy. If you want to be visually and audibly entertained for about an hour and a half, shut your brain off, sit back and enjoy Burlesque. Disclaimer: this recommendation does not pertain to men, unless you are a man of the Cher-loving variety. Despite a burlesque club technically being a 'strip club' this movie is certainly geared for the ladies.",7,43,50,11 April 2011
Straight Outta Compton," Potential but Ends Up a Superficial Retelling
","I was extremely disappointed by this film. With the Oscar controversy and the snub, I had high hopes. After watching the movie, it didn't deserve to be nominated for any awards. What I think is the bigger controversy, though, is that the writers received a completely undeserved Oscar nomination.The movie begins amazingly well. The first scene really gives you the setting. The dingy small house, bars on windows, a male dominated society, drug dealings, the militarized police, Compton is bleak. I was excited, I'm in for a gritty edgy story about the controversial pioneers of gangster rap (even if in reality, they aren't so gangster). Then, it was all down hill from here. So what went wrong?First problem was the script and possibly the editing. Overall, haphazard is the best way to describe the plot. The main focus of the story is the financial dispute between Cube and Eazy-E. However, I felt like the story was more concerned with ticking off all the boxes of things that Dre and Cube wanted to be shown rather than telling a coherent and compelling story - the Bye, Felicia scene, check - Ice Cube trashing a music execs office, check etc. Some scenes in the story come about with little explanation. An example of the careless story telling is how the infamous song, 'F*** Tha Police,' was handled. That was a hugely controversial song with 1st amendment implications and the challenging of censorship in America. It had so much build up with the police harassment. It leads to a riot and then Cube jokes about Raiders gear and we never hear about 'F*** Tha Police' again.I felt like the poor script was due to the writers being handcuffed by Ice Cube and Dr. Dre who produced the film. They were going to have the story told they way they remembered it and not by an objective third party. Dre and Cube are the 'good guys.' Even when Cube destroys an execs office, we are supposed to be cheering for him. While his frustration is real, I think a better script would have you wavering between whether he was throwing a tantrum or justified. Dre is literally just there most of the time. He's a producer so he does get some story line. DJ Yella and MC Ren could've been left on the cutting room floor without losing anything. Did they really contribute so little? I looked them up and they are credited as writers on most songs. Eazy-E who is the movies quasi-villain, and not around to tell his side of the story, is even shown to not really be so bad, just misguided by their manager Jerry Heller. It all felt so superficial, like it was only scratching the surface. The characters were flat and one dimensional - these are real people, right? Or maybe I got too hung up on the tone set by the first scene. The last scene also mistakenly thought the movie had stayed in the tone of the first scene. I didn't feel enough chaos for the final word to land with the intended impact.I found the acting to be mostly sub-par minus the seasoned actor Giamatti. He's good here but it's not his best and I felt like he was a somewhat awkward fit for the role. The acting standout of the cast was Jason Mitchell who played Eazy-E. There really isn't much to say about the directing other than it was passable. Also, the movie was at least a half an hour too long and really dragged in the second half.In the end, it was typical, bland, biopic fare.",5,22,56,16 March 2016
Looper," The trouble with time travel
","I love sci fi movies and futuristic ones, even if the future is a deteriorated version of the now instead of an improved one. The trouble with time travel is it always leads to plot holes and this one had a couple. The movie was good except for some nagging logical inconsistencies. So I am going to talk rather openly about the movie, though you may not fully understand unless you have seen it.Joe BW - the Bruce Willis version of Joe 30 years older, Joe JGL - the younger Joseph Gordon Lovett version of JoeJoe is a looper, killing people from the future. When your loop is closed, the last person you kill is yourself with a big pay out. Then you have 30 more years to live until you are the older version of you sent back in time and killed by yourself. So Joe BW kills himself when he is young and lives out the rest of his 30 years. Most of it still living a drugged violent life until he meets a woman who cleans him up and makes him anew. When they come to send him back in time, his wife is murdered. So, Joe BW who is now a very skilled killer manages to jump back in time and survive Joe JGL trying to kill him - this is already a change since Joe BW killed his older self. Joe BW comes up with the plan to eliminate the rainmaker, the terrible gang leader in the future he feels is responsible for his wife's death. I am guessing all along they were killing people for the rainmaker??? The idea is killing the rainmaker will save the wife and keep him from being sent back in time. Right? Another key point, though Joe BW exists at the same time as the younger Joe JGL, whatever happens to Joe JGL affects Joe BW. Joe JGL cuts himself and Joe BW gets the scar - time travel shouldn't work that way, Joe BW should solely be the product of the life he lived unaffected by changes he causes, but these are the rules the movie sets up which also contributes to the plot and the plot holes. Also let me add, the impression I got was the reason Joe BW survives his loop being closed is because of his wife, yet he obsessively checks his watch to make sure he still meets her. Joe BW when young killed his old self presumably because he didn't meet the wife and she didn't die. So since scars show up on BW's body, if the future is changed so Joe JGL doesn't meet the wife, Joe BW should disappear.Anyway, Joe BW's plan is to find the rainmaker who is still a child and kill him to change the future. As Joe BW is about to shoot the rainmaker's mother to get to the child, Joe JGL has an epiphany about what made the rainmaker so bad and kills himself to stop his older version Joe BW. The idea is Joe BW killing his mother is what makes the rainmaker evil. Here is my issue, in the original time-line, Joe BW had nothing to do with the rainmaker and therefore had nothing to do with what turned the rainmaker bad so even without Joe, we still risk the rainmaker being evil. Second, if the rainmaker is who sent Joe BW back in the first place, him not turning bad would mean Joe BW should disappear as he was never sent back in time - also because Joe BW is not unique from Joe JGL, whatever epiphany Joe JGL has, Joe BW should have. So the fact that Joe BW only disappears when Joe JGL kills himself means that the rainmaker must still be bad and have sent Joe BW back in time. Remember, it is not Joe who is originally responsible for the rainmaker being bad. Every second Joe BW is there means that whatever has happened in the now has not changed the future.The better ending would be Joe JGL having his epiphany about why the rainmaker turns bad changes the future. Joe BW who is about to shoot his mother should have the epiphany too and then disappear as the future is changed and he is never sent back in time. Then perhaps, Joe JGL can either go on his way or stay with the rainmaker and his mother to help protect them and ensure the rainmaker will be good instead of evil as he has potential for both.Have you gone cross-eyed reading and trying to understand this? I still liked the movie but will still be waiting for a time travel story that can iron out the difficulties with time travel.",6,0,2,6 January 2013
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Please stop making these movies!
","The first movie was cute and entertaining. I was pleasantly surprised that Bay could take a beloved toy and cartoon from the '80's and make it into a good action flick. Beyond the first movie, there really isn't that much of a story to tell and so they should have stopped. Transfomers also lack a wider culture to draw from so each movie feels the same- I'll compare it to Indiana Jones which usually has the same hero and villains, Nazis, but Indiana has the benefit of a plethora of interesting civilizations to write stories around. So please stop Hollywood, stop making these movies. They are merely a product for consumption and merchandising.This movie was way too long with unending action scenes. Am I the only who gets annoyed by Shia's fumbling? I felt the movie also went into an inappropriate realm the others didn't. There was a scene where a man is killed and it is made to look like a suicide. It is depicted comically as he falls by the window and there are even jokes afterwards about him being splatted on the pavement. This is just one example. I don't mind dark humor, actually I love dark humor, but this just seemed out of place with the tone and audience of the movie. I thought these movies were at least in part for kids?Lastly, since I completely zoned out in the middle of the movie and was just hoping it was going to end soon, something dangerous started happening - I got to thinking. Autobots are supposed to be gender neutral but are all voiced by men? Why? It is not as if they have synthetic voices. There does seem to be an affect on some of the voices to add a deeper growl but why can't that be applied to a female voice? The autobots could have the same personalities and be voiced by a woman. I would guess most people view the transformers as all male. I looked into matter and read how at one time female autobots were added but were somewhat anatomically correct and were stereotypically more feminine. Sigh... However, I'll take no female voiced autobots over giving 'female' autobots breasts and gender specific roles which is far more tragic! These movies are decidedly male and I do not mean that because they have explosions.I gave it 2 stars because someone works very hard on the CGI.",2,3,8,19 February 2012
Atonement," The Worst Movie Ever Made!
","This movie tops my list for ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY the WORST movie ever made. I have seen Cleopatra, Showgirls, tons of Adam Sandler movies, and All About Steve which does come in a close second but with out doubt this is the worst movie of all time. It is pompous and awful. It is so bad that I don't know where to begin. There are so many people that herald this a good movie on IMDb, even the professional critics reviewed it positively. It was even nominated for an Oscar for best picture, ugh - just shows how irrelevant awards are. This is where great production and a grandiose story along with some misguided critics can lead to garbage being considered good and brainwashing viewers into agreeing - must conform. Basically, the movie has no plot which means there isn't a lot to discuss and also jumps through time awkwardly. Then when you learn what the main character did and how she tries to atone, it just feels false and falls flat considering what she initially did was quite unforgivable and still is. Then the end tries to be overly sentimental and instead is moronic. This movie is bad, bad, bad....",1,5,10,1 December 2011
