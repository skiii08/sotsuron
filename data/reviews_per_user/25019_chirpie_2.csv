Raiders of the Lost Ark," Well aware of itself, this is the strength of this movie
",Steven Spielberg himself said that he had every intention of making a B-Grade serial adventure movie of days gone by.In doing so he created a movie that transended the boundaries of anything the original creators probably ever intended. The movie hums along at such a brisk pace and packs such an exuberance that any minor critiques  will soon be lost as the smile appears on your face.Ford has always been of the more 'Hollywood' style actors and there are few movies more appropriate for this kind of style than this.The whole movie's downright whimsical nature combined with slight adult sensibilities no doubt help broaden this movies appeal as it will surely delight audiences young (but not too young ^_^) and old.,10,0,0,20 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Bah to Naysayers
","Saw the midnight showing last night. I was worried about what audience I would get. (It's good to have an enthusiastic crowd but I didn't want hecklers...) They were all great. Bah to all the naysayers. I was glued to my seat. Surely there were improvements to be had but I was having way to much fun just watching the movie. For every Elephaunt (misspelled I'm sure) crashing into another I was feeling like a kid again. Grinning ear to ear. I'll consider myself lucky since I never read the books and don't have the burden of my imagination to contend with like others do. I'm sad it's all over but soon I'll have a wonderful DVD trilogy sitting on my shelf that I can revisit any time I darn well please. Kudos to all involved. I had my fun, and only wish I had this much of  a rush everytime I stepped into the multiplexes.",10,0,0,17 December 2003
