The Expendables 2," Entertaining to the last bit...
","This is indeed one of the most entertaining movies I've seen of late. There isn't much script or any breathtaking acting performances here. If you are looking for a movie with a deep script then please don't watch this movie because this one isn't for you. What makes this movie amazing is the way it is presented with subtle acts of humour and hilarious 'one liners', not to forget the awesome action clicks. Chuck Norris stole the show with his grand entry. I really don't get why people are posting negative reviews on this movie. This isn't a movie for the critics and if you people really disliked this movie, then why go for it in the first place, surely the trailers gave enough idea on what kind of movie this was going to be with an iconic star cast and a crazy script. There is never a dull moment in this movie and for all people looking for some fun and a good laugh this is a movie you can't miss. Don't think, just watch and have fun.",9,3,4,7 October 2012
