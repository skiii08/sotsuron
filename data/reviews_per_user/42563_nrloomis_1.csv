Walk the Line," This is a must see - Johnny Cash fan or not!
",I will admit I am not the biggest Johnny Cash fan - only being exposed to the music from my grandmother and grandfather in my earlier days. But I got excited when I saw the trailer for this movie. Unfortunately I waited about 2 months to see this - and I wish I didn't. I don't think I've seen a portrayal of a musician's life done so well. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were awesome together and sang beautifully. The story flowed so smoothly and made you really appreciate and understand the the impact they both made on the music world! I just can't say enough good things about this film - you will definitely want to see it again and again.,10,0,0,11 January 2006
