Source Code," Terrible
","Source Code is one of the most disappointing moves I have ever seen in the theater.Well what to expect from Jake Gyllenhall , a wannabe movie star whose all top grossing movies have been all supporting roles to more accomplished movie actors like Heath Ledger and Anne Hathaway.The movie started promisingly, with its Vantage point like sequences where the director would revert to the original scene repeatedly. I was so disgusted with the ending which failed to convey any logic and give us an unbelievably stupid happy ending.My question is how the hell could he have not died...he was dead for god sakes...I cannot stomach it..getting the bad guy was one thing but to save everyone aboard and then come back to life was absolute crap.How dare the director make us watch a movie which built on a premise that he was dead and suitably change the concept of the so called' source code' and bring him back to life with the notion that he can ultimately change the fate by altering a few circumstances.Rubbish!! What to happened to the guy whose body he assumed , everyone else was saved but that poor guy was discarded and the director made Jake assume his place and get his girl friend , If he saved everyone how the hell does he explain that guy not coming back to life.Science fiction I understand but IT Totally DEFIES LOGIC...If he just assumed the guys body, what happened to that guy's soul or inner self..it is a gross injustice to the teacher horrible.It would have been more believable if he could have saved everyone including the teacher and HE remained dead...",1,17,33,22 May 2011
The Devil Wears Prada," The most cool Devil
",I have always enjoyed Meryl Streep in all her movies but this was one of the best performances of the summer. She is unbelievably menacing and u just love the way she commands everyone in Runway office.I love the way she is so sarcastic and gets whatever she wants.She deserves her 14th Oscar nomination for this role .What a talented actress. She is truly a acting godThough she had less screen time than 'Princess' Anne Hathway the movie is Meryl Streep. The supporting cast includes Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt who deliver creditable performances.Blunt(who i have never seen before) is incredibly funny as the snooty 1st assistant to Streep and her scenes with Hathway are really funny.The movie was directed really well and is one of the stylish films I have seen and has set fashion trends all over the world. Must see movie of the year.Don't miss it.,9,0,1,7 October 2006
