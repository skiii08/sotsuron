Iron Man 3," Fantastic.
","I was an extra in this film. They shot for two days in Dania Beach, Florida. Unfortunately I don't recall a second of it used in the movie. It was raining hard all day long and with free lunch and an arm's reach away from the stars I can't complain. I love the movie. Shane Black formulated a billion dollar box office smash. I hear there will not be a part four because the Avengers will be taking over. I would like to see more work from Mr. Black. I kind of wish the film came out in 3D. The Air Force 1 scene was a classic. Perhaps Mr. Black could also surprise us with another comic book hero in the future with even more compact action.",Null,1,3,24 March 2014
Collateral," Sequel?
","Michael Mann never fails when it comes to action films. The quality of this film is phenomenal. The palm trees seen perfectly in the dark night. The film earned enough collateral for a sequel. There were unnatural scenes where the cab driver had plenty of opportunities to escape. Vincent had a brilliant disguise. And Max was a smooth pay check to pay check...underpaid American with a dream like all of us have...to better ourselves which we mostly all fail to achieve. His limo business would likely fail, felt he was too poor for the hot black girl that likes him, motivation, etc. Jason from the beginning would be great in a sequel. Who was he? What's his story? He bumps into Vincent handing him a briefcase full of goodies...sequel, please.",Null,0,1,24 March 2014
Now You See Me," So good I can see a part 3
",The story is fantastic. The actors were perfect for their roles. The framing was a little too much; meaning vengeance could have been played out differently. I really dig the love scene towards the end; never thought they'd hit it off. Part 2 should be a good one too. I can't wait to see if Danny boy gets it on with magic hottie. Is it possible for Lionel to fake his death for part 2? The chemistry is so smooth that I even see a part 3 that could work. Here's a little magic for the future tip: Abbra Cadabbera (spell check) you keep making great films I keep buying great tickets! Is there really a place in Paris where you can go to lock away secrets? If so I have to go. ......I'm ready for the next trick...........1...........2..........,9,2,3,19 May 2014
