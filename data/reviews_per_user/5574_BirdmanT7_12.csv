Blade Runner 2049," Good as a Scifi but not as a sequel
","I think it was over two years ago when I read on IMBD that Riddley Scott was going to direct the sequel or the new Blade Runner?!. I felt 'Blade Runner' was a not film to have a sequel and it should just be left alone among the great films ever made. But when Abrams launched the reboot of the 'Star Wars' franchise, once George Lucas sold it to Disney, this idea of a sequel to old films or TV series like 'Twin Peaks' was happening across the studios and 'Blade Runner' was a sci-fi that had its own global cult culture. The idea of a sequel was actually caught on with fans like wildfire. Some or many questioned was a Deckard a replicant due what Riddley's unicorn dream revere scene when Deckard was leaning on his piano, that was the monkey wrench that Riddley threw into the film of his own doing; it was not even in the script and not a scene that Hammpton Fincher liked either because Deckard was never meant to be a Replicant, nor was he in the PKD novel, but that Ridley's insert created huge discussion across boards and theories that were argued and debated over thirty years. The news of the sequel was like this long-awaited enigma to be finally answered; I am sure once they saw this new sequel there was not even a mention of Deckard as a replicant.In the two years of the wait for the making of the new Blade Runner, Riddley's brother died and he also changed his priorities to shift from directing Blade Runner to those awful 'Alien' prequels that even critics asked the same question as to why would Riddley invest his time to the Alien films and not to his probably best creation 'Blade Runner'.? Then came the news of 'Denis Villeneuve' taking over the project and directing; for me even more depressing, because as much as Denis Villeneuve has gained this name for himself as this new great director, but I find all his films somewhat incoherent and missing something. The most recent I can think of was Sicario' that started out good but then it was going in circles, with constant complaints and redundant scenes of Emily Blunt and his partner, the unexplained 'Benicio Del Toro' mystery hitman at the end was even so cliche, the wasted screen time of the Mexican Policeman and his family where he had no exact part into the body of the story. However, to the average audience 'Sicario' who just want to see some drug dealers get killed regardless how the story is told it was a hit. Directors like Villeneuve get popularity from the masses, I think was chosen maybe mostly because of his other film 'Arrival', which I liked but only again in parts not as a whole piece. It just seems long gone are the days where directors like Coppola could make a film like 'Conversation' where it's focus was a character first. Director's whose priority concern was always the STORY and not so much visuals and that's reversed over the years and given rise to directors like Villeneuve, whose work to me on the screen seems broken or missing parts, this new Blade Runner had the same pattern.Now, after the long wait and anticipation of this new Blade Runner, especially when 'Harrison Ford' was the first actor who signed on to be a part of this, which even surprised Riddley?!. In the original BR Ford had many problems working with Riddley and mostly lack of direction; how much he hated doing Blade Runner. Harrison Ford who just came off his recent Star Wars sequel now gets to be in the other scifi sequel as Deckard again. For an actor at Ford's age, a sequel like those films is like a rebirth of their career that exposes him to a new generation of audience, so there was no surprise for me to see Ford to be in the sequel and there would be no story to follow without him. I saw this new Blade Runner about four times and yes at first viewing I had a similar reaction to compare it to the original, but that was where I felt it was a mistake to devalue a film to compare to what came 30 years ago and from a director who had a vision he fought very hard to create and it was never going to be repeated again. And if there was ever meant to be a sequel Riddley would have done it years ago, but he didn't make the BR to ever have a sequel.For me I had to view this film as just a scifi film on its own, separate the idea of the sequel and then judge it objectively. However, what I found the most preposterous premise of the story was when they find the remains of Rachel the replicant's skeleton?.. How can a replicant have a skeleton? where did we see in the original BR a Tyrel factory that showed these androids being made or to have a skeleton bones to last as the humans?. But what topped it to be even more absurd was that Rachel the replicant had given birth to a child?!I just could not wrap my mind around that idea at all?. How and why Hampton Fincher wrote this story or was it Riddley's dictation? or was it Micheal Green's brain fart and Hampton went along with since he is not a working writer in Hollywood?. And how did these people conceived or all agreed that it was logical?.. It was the most ludicrous part of the story that I almost began to lose interest in the film and felt this was just so lame BR is turned into a Soap-Scifi where K even believes he is Rachel's son and begins his search for his long lost father Deckard.The premise could have take being the Rachel's body had the longest life than any Replicant and that ties into what Tyrel said that Rachel was special, but procreation from a robot?. It was too far fetched and debunked this film on that premise alone; then to have the audience think it was K the replicant to be the child was another kind of monkey wrench into the puzzle.I was very patient each time I watched it, I loved some parts of it and who surprised the most was Ryan Gosling; whom I respect his work but I wasn't sure he was right for this role and he proved me wrong, he was perfect for it. I didn't care so much for Robin Wright, she is good actor but she kind of walked through this role. Many people didn't like Jared Leto, but again it was comparison to Tyrel that maybe devalues Leto's acting, he played this character very dead pan and detached as if he was a robot himself and just disconnected with reality, it was almost disturbing. Leto is among one of the best talented and authentic actors working today. The actress who surprised me the most was 'Sylvia Hoeks' who played Luv and she stole the movie. I have never even seen this girl in anything and she was good from beginning to end, she projected this very tormented or even conflicted character, Luv was someone who maybe called evil by simple terms but she was a confused or misguided creation of Wallace.
I also liked Harrison Ford in this film as the elder recluse Deckard, I didn't care for the fight scenes with Ryan. What I disliked the most was the CGI and this new look of the future that was o cheesy and fake with all those weird holograms flying or the ballerina?. Yes its 30 years later but does the future become so dull and grey too?. The Grey scale color was the repeating theme of this film, where everything seemed dead and flat and time also felt slowed down; the choice of music and sounds were good but not as good as the original, which was hypnotic.Perhaps the most annoying and waste of screen time was 'Joi', the hologram girl friend of K,. Why so much time screen time on her?, that same amount of time could have been focused on another story like 'Mariette' who was the escort girl and part of the replicant revolt. That was actually an interesting insert into the story where the replicant joined to fight for their freedom, that could have been more developed where K's relationship with Mariette could have also created the questioning of his existence. But for some reason Joi' was more important, which again served no purpose into the body of the story. As I stated before either the director didn't know how to edit those scenes or the writers wanted them in but Villeneuves just seemed like he was a director to hire and Riddley was kind of still making the big decisions?, The intro scene where K figthts the replicant farmer, that was written for the original film and it was never shot, but now used here in the opening of this sequel and ofcourse we now have a replicant Blade Runner, another one of Riddley's wishes.After the fourth viewing of this film I had totally let go of relating or comparing it to the original Blade Runner, it was this fourth time that it really grew on me and it had an emotional effect on me with the ending of K's conflict that kind of tied maybe to the theme of Phillip K Dick work? or the original Blade Runner? where a replicant is more human than human to care and risk his life to protect someone like Deckard and his daughter, just as Roy Baty did to save Deckard's life, a man who killed everyone Roy loved and yet he saved his life because he valued life. Although, this film didn't evoke the same emotions or feelings I get when I watch the original Blade Runner, to me what Roy says to Deckard before he does is the most moving scene; where a Replicant cherished life more than humans. This sequel didn't have that have that kind of strong scenes, but its a still a decent film on its own. I will never ever place this film in the same league as the original Blade Runner, that was a anomaly.What is the most saddest part of this rebirth of 'Blade Runner' is that it will now join the franchise category, where there will be a sequel or sequels, maybe a TV series too. And that unique cult underground scifi classic film that really changed the way we looked at science fiction now will become another franchise money machine for the studios and the greedy movie corporate world who treat everything as a product.",Null,1,3,13 January 2018
Skyfall," Soap opera Bond, entirely overrated.
","It's just ironic how this Bond film'Skyfall' gets a 7.8 rating here on IMDb and yet almost 90% of people's reviews are all negative?. I happen to like the first two Bond films with Craig as Bond. I never liked Brosnan at all, but Craig really created a more charismatic Bond almost as Connery did in the 'Doctor No'. I remember years back reading a article I read in the Calendar of the LA Times reading an article about Craig picked as the new James Bond and how the whole franchise will restart from the beginning with 'Casino Royal' and it was a great concept and they really pulled it off with a director Martin Campell who kept the film interesting because it was focused on developing the character of Bond again rather than just action packed scenes.'Quantum' that was the sequel to Casino Royal that again set up another super power evil corp 'Quantum' which as 'Doctor NO' did with Spector. Bond films have always been about spying to discover these kind of people with power and criminal intent, I think Skyfall departed with that concept when they planted the seeds of 'Quantum' in the first two films and and suddenly it became a soap opera about M in Skyfall with some deranged lunatic's taking revenge on M?. Even the last film 'Quantum of Solace', as much as it was scorned it was still far superior film compare to this turkey 'Skyfall' which really is among the worst Bond film to date right next to the 'Timothy Dalton' Bond series.I happen to like Sam Mendez as a director for films like 'American Beauty' but I think this Bond genre was way over his head. He was just all over the place; there was so many bad scenes that just hang on the screen, Bond was absent being Bond, the soap opera with M and her reciting poem in court was just awful. What are we watching here people?. I liked the idea of introducing the new 'Q', but maybe someone older with a sense of humor, rather than the college nerdy look whose screen presence was just annoying to say the least. Even the casting of the new 'Moneypenny' is just a miscast, again Naomie Harris is a great in other films I have seen her in but sorry not as Moneypenny?. From the first action scene where Moneypenny shoots Bond by mistake but still has enough time to shoot the villain and she pauses; I had a feeling from that scene alone that this film is heading the wrong direction. Then there is the absence of Bond being dead and where we have no idea how he got rescued by whom?. There are scenes where he is dressed as a some limo driver in the airport and following a guy and it was just so lame, the time we spent watching him in his car and driving to the airport and waiting with sun glasses was a waste of screen time for a Bond film. Theree was another scene where Bond is captured with Silva's men, Silva has a gun in his hand, then there is a helicopter and Bond manages to disarm the Silvia's men but the next shot Silvia has no gun in his hand?...I mean how can a director like Mendez screw up a shot like that on a huge budget film like this?. Those fight scenes in the casino were just so lame and so poorly choreographed as if you are watching some B movie, it was just awful and boring to watch. There was just continuous tedious scenes when Bond is trying to hide M, by getting his old Austin Martin and that old house in the country, it just was a waste of screen time going no where. In the entire history of all the Bond films M's character was just a minor character that appeared in maybe 4 scenes in the entire movie,but ever since they cast Judie Dench as M, then M became a major character in the Bond series. It's amazing this genre or franchise has lasted this over 50 years, when all the books Flemming wrote were made already. Craig was a miracle to restart the Bond franchise for a whole new generation but I guess today's audience is not concerned about story as the Connery generation was. They just want to see if Bond will save the world by killing the bad guys. 'Skyfall' had potential for a great Bond film but it really was a disaster and yet it made so much money and had great critic reviews; which goes to show how much BS can studio shovel with the right marketing to this dummy down generation.I just read Mendez is directing the next Bond film, I bet even he was surprised he was picked to come back. This time they are introducing the oldest Bond nemesis 'Ernst Stavro Blofeld'; I dread to think how Mendez will manage to screw that up too?. Ever since Brocolli's daughter took over managing the Bond Franchise she has made some really bad choices; she just does not get the Bond series like her father Cubby did.The Bond films ended with Roger Moore, that was all the Bond books, what we have now is a mutated butchered studio version of what Flemming had written who would be rolling in his grave if he knew a two hour Bond film was spent on M.",Null,8,16,30 November 2014
The Irishman," Much Ado About Nothing but hype?
","Is the hype surrounding this film 'The Irishman' justified? Not in the least. It is a case of much ado about nothing. I read some of the reviews here and I am just at owes at how much people praise this mess ?!. I question the validity of these people who leave these reviews here on IMDB and so should anyone who reads them, because these people could be working for the Hollywood industry to create more hype created by Martin Scorsese's marketing team and himself to brag about his own film with the cast on a video on Netflix. I think people in this country follow social media and just media like sheep and believe the BS before they even get a chance to see the movie. The same thing happened here on IMDB with the mess Tarantino made called 'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' where there was instant reviews here on IMDB before the movie even had wide release. Look how long that lasted in the theaters, not even 3 weeks for just hyped up crap?I say the same thing is happening here again that even someone 'Martin Scorsese' has to rely on social media hype to promote a mess he made, because that is the way the only way to salvage a mess, is to keep a lie to become a mindset for the mindless masses whose life is spent on social media. But enough on that subject let's just focus on this bogus film about a guy 'Frank Sheeran' whose story was debunked by FBI and dismissed as he was questioned before and after he wrote this book, that FBI found that he lied over and over and none of it added up together. Furthermore, due to the history of mob killings; they would never hire a person outside of their organization who was not an ITALIAN and a made to take out someone like Hoffa, that's just does not happen and over the years the evidence found proved that Frank Sheeran's story is partially true that he knew Hoffa and was close to the mob but he didn't kill Hoffa.But Martin Scorsese didn't care about the truth, he cared about the DRAMA of how this story translates on the screen and to make a comeback with what he knows best from Mean streets to Casino, the lives of these Mafia and the crimes they were involved, he makes these people to be of such importance, people whom had less than high school education and committed some of the most monstrous crimes in this country such as Killing the President (JKK).Watching Al Pacino with that cartoonish make up and hair, or the rest of the cast made me just feel embarrassed for these people that looked hideous like something you saw cartoon or Sat Night live parody. I urge you to back and watch 'Dick Tracy' 1990 version that Warren Beaty made, see the performance and make up of Al Pacino as 'Big Boy Caprice' is not as a comical as him playing 'Jimmy Hoffa'...Lol I would still rather watch Dick Tracy than the Irishman, because to even cast Pacino as Hoffa was a joke to begin, he was a White Irishman, and Jack Nicholson in 'Hoffa' was more believable than Pacino, first for the physical appearance and Nicholson was much closer ethnicity than Pacino with that weird accent and hairdoo that was you could not see any Hoffa in Pacino performance.To me De Niro was just as comical with this CGI de-aging because he just looked as pathetic and hideous as Pacino. The dialogue was just repetitive and tedious. I can go and watch Good Fellas and Casino and enjoy them, but its the format of the film that makes it flow, I love slow films but the Irishman is not like watch Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon', where the film camera movement and zoom are slow for a reason to slow down time but the film still flows smoothly, with the Irishman you don;t know where it's going to end? there are so many scenes that it should have ended the film within 2 hours but how the studios would even allow or not question why this film is so long, filled with scenes that don't go any where, most of it just voice over with De Niro talking as if his character has any moral latitude to even feel sorry for that you care what he is even saying, compare to Goodfellas where the ending, when Ray Liotta is talking to the audience directly, it was unusual and different that grabbed your attention that his witness protection program was worse than prison because he was a no body anymore, but the film had a punch to it that a life of crime is a dead end but for Frank Sheeran he still had the priest to repent to? WHO the F cares?This entire film was based on hype and the cast of these Actors who really should really be retired, I personally refuse to see another film with PACINO or DENIRO in. I just want to remember them in Godfather, Taxi Driver, Heat, but not this mess. I will say that the only reason I stayed watching this film was mostly for 'Joe Pesci's' performance who not only surprised me but kept me interested to watch to the end, I would not be surprised if he gets an Oscar for that performance at the end in prison as the old man, that was just outstanding for someone who really has been absent from acting for so long.",Null,2,7,3 December 2019
Troy," 'Troy isn't a story of heroes and villains, its view of human nature, war, anger, and revenge.'
","As we all know 'Troy' was recently released on DVD, and for those of us who missed it on the big screen (like myself) we really missed out on a great film.I am now amazed as to why this film got so much negative reviews when it was released?!. It's far superior film compare to 'Gladiator' which was just awful. Again here on IMDb there are more negative reviews, I really wonder what are you people comparing this film to?..how many films like these are made in Hollywood today?. Troy isn't a story of heroes and villains, of good triumphing over evil, but of flawed, selfish men locked in a deadly struggle in which there can be no winners, only losers. In contrast to Gladiator, which celebrated revenge and vilified its antagonist, Troy sees in the pursuit of vengeance only tragedy and deceit, and its one great occasion of nobility is a heartbreaking moment of shared humanity between sworn enemies. Maybe the director and the writer didn't or couldn't do Homer's 'The Iliad' the way it was written. Homer's cast of characters Â— Zeus, Aphrodite, and other luminaries of the Greek pantheon are missing. Offended purists should note that Director Petersen's is not the first recounting of the Trojan War to tell the story from a mortal point of view; Shakespeare did the same centuries ago. No good movie about the Trojan war has ever actually been made, even at the height of Hollywood's sword-and-sandal period. Lots of things can go wrong in a sword-and-sandal picture, and many of them did in Robert Wise's 1953 Helen of Troy, probably the most notable previous cinematic stab at the tale other than TV version of 'Helen of Troy' which wasn't that bad but still doesn't even come close to TROY.For one thing, the screenplay by David Benioff retains the basic contours of the established story. That's not to say important liberties aren't taken, but on the whole major plot points are preserved. This applies not just to the two elements everybody remembers, the Trojan horse and Achilles' heel (though Achilles' heel is not actually from Homer), but also to such plot points as the falling-out of Achilles (Brad Pitt) and Agamemnon (Brian Cox) over Achilles' Trojan comfort woman Briseis (Rose Byrne); a critical sequence in which one soldier is mistaken for another; and an eerily topical incident involving the abuse of an enemy soldier's dead body. Just as important, key themes and outlooks common to various stories from Homer to Shakespeare carry over into the film, including a tragic view of human nature, war, anger, and revenge. Many of the battle scenes are riveting, especially a dramatic early scene involving a spectacular stunt and the bravura showdown between Achilles and Hector (Eric Bana), one of the best duels I've ever seen. The drama is engaging; unlike Gladiator, which expected us to root for the hero, Troy asks us only to appreciate the characters' conflicts and situations. And Peter O'Toole as the Trojan king Priam steals the entire film with one single scene with Brad Pitt' it was probably the most emotional part of the film. So we can all sit back and complain how bad this film was made and how it failed, and never really take into consideration that for a Blockbuster Hollywood film (which is only focused on making money)this film managed to deliver on both levels. How many films of this scale do that in a year? or in a decade?. We all want Hollywood to make more epic films like these and because of the historic or nostalgic value of it, at least TROY managed to achieve something which is very essential in our time..... war, anger, and revenge..sounds familiar?.",Null,1,2,9 January 2005
The Aviator," The Aviator: Fact or Fiction ?
","'The Aviator' has all the great elements of a great film yet its still a typical Hollywood movie. There is a great scene when Katherine Hepburn tells Hughes: 'we are not like others, are we Howard?...don't let them(publicity) in because they will make you into a freak'. I think Scorsese did exactly that, he doesn't let you into the real life of Howard Hughes. He feeds you what you have heard or read in tabloids over so many years and there is nothing new you will discover in this film. I don't know why but Aviator didn't feel like Scorsese's film? it looks and feels more like Spielberg or Ron Howard film?. Then again Scorsese's last few films are a far cry from his 'Raging Bull' days and this is where I was kind of disappointed because Scorsese use to push the envelope and didn't conform so much to the Hollywoood formula. This film with all its great photography and cast yet it remains an empty film and not the work of a great film maker like Martin Scorsese.Aviator got a lot of great reviews and nominated for many Oscars and I admit I did enjoy watching it for its masterful film craft but at the same I think there was so much more about the elusive life of the great Howard Hughes that some how this film refused to even make a hint of it. For example its true that Hughes was a great womanizer but its also true that he also liked to sleep with Men; he lived bisexual life for many years, he had many affairs with stars like 'Cary Grant' and 'Guy Maddison', and even 'Gary Cooper', etc,this is all documented in Darwin Porter's book 'Howard Hugues: Hell's Angel'. This is why again I find the similarities of Spielberg/Ron Howard childish eye candy style of film making, whom both made their own version of books like 'Color Purple' and 'Beautiful Mind' and decided to omit that dirty little secret. I just think if you are going to make a film about someone's life why not be more honest; sure Hughes was depicted as being as arrogant with a huge ego but in this day and age to make a film and depict someone so one dimensional which adheres to all myths and tabloids its just playing it too safe for someone like Martin Scorsese. Oliver Stone's film of 'Alexandra' may have not gotten such great reviews maybe because he debunked how history had depicted Alexandra, but yet he stated the truth written in History about the Greek way of life at that time and Alexandra's relationships with both men and woman; his sexuality didn't make him less of a man and the same would apply to Hughes. However, Stone refused to compromise his integrity as a film maker and I am really sorry to see Scorsese has in the Aviator, and please don't think I am saying because I some some GAY advocate, because I am not, the truth about Howard Hughes has been well known for years in Hollywood.I was impressed with De Caprio's performance mostly in the second half of the film; but I still felt he was too young for this role. If you see any photos of Hughes even in his twenties he looked very mature and even older; he was big man, brisk in stature, 6'4 in height and well built. I once saw a TV mini series called 'The Great Howard Hughes' played by Tommy Lee Jones and I must say to this day I have yet to see anyone match that performance; because Tommy Lee Jones comes from Texas and even looked like Hughes and he really nailed it, De Caprio doesn't even come close to how Hughes looks or to that performance of Tommy Lee Jones, but for today's young audience they wouldn't even know the difference; De Caprio is picked because he is liked and well known by a wide audience regardless he fit this part or not.Overall this is a good and entertaining film about a fictional version of Howard Hughes but one really has to question how much is fact and how much is fiction?. Perhaps the court hearing are the high point of the whole film, one has to admire and respect Hughes for his integrity fighting for his beliefs and love of Aviation, I hope one day Mr Scorsese does the same when it comes to making films the way he use to.",Null,2,3,21 June 2005
The Revenant," very overrated and confused movie?
","I only went to see this film because of the director 'Iñárritu' and it was very disappointing. It started out with a good premise, it felt like an art film at times, it reminded me a lot of 'Terrence Malick' films, one in particular 'The New World'. However, this quest to revenge is where I think the film failed. There was a lot of great scenes with the main character Glass having visions and memories of his wife; that could have been to reflect on finding some kind of forgiveness. The other Indian 'Elk Dog' who was also looking for his own revenge of his daughter could have been explored further to parallel to Glass's revenge of Fitzgerald; where they could have met and maybe the exchange of their meeting would have had an impact on Glass to reflect.I know no book is ever translated to the screen exactly the same, I just thought this film had the potential to add more depth together with the visuals to the arc of the story. Glass was helped by the Indian who also suffered a lost, then Glass rescued another Indian girl who was getting raped and those two characters alone could have had more of exchange with Glass. The film relied way too much on visuals that character. Glass's journey is an odyssey in itself, like Homer's odyssey, but in this odyssey 'The Revenant' is an empty one at that, where the film didn't present you characters that parallel, cross and effect's Glass's character for him to maybe reflect his quest to revenge. That's where the movie felt short. So yes people rave about the visuals and Di Caprio's performance, which again I had problems with because I don't think he is a good actor either; just way way too over rated, he is like a parody as an actor. I would have picked maybe either Jeremy Renner, Christian Bale or even Tom Hardy for the role of Glass, I just see more range from those actors than DiCaprio; he is like a boy pretending to be a man. The film continued on this relentless and unrealistic path where Glass survived the impossible, first to survive a bear attack is one thing but to live through the wilderness winter ice cold weather with the injuries he had, no food, then to swim down the river, then jump off a cliff with a horse and survive that again?. I had already lost interest midway into the movie, where its all about Glass survival's to avenge his son's death. There was no arc in the story for this character to maybe pause to question his revenge, it would have had more of impact if Glass had found forgiveness for Fitzgerald through his journey, maybe through all the visions of his wife, maybe by his interactions with the Indian who helped him whom had also lost his wife or Elk Dog. Maybe a better ending would have been once Glass found Fitzgerald he had realized his revenge was futile?. Maybe if Fitzgerald had ran into the Indians later and got killed by them instead, it would have been karma catching up to him, not being half stabbed to death by hands of Glass.Even Glass himself said right at the end: 'Revenge is in God's hands, not mine', which debunked and contradicted all his actions. Where did Glass found God in the entire film that he suddenly had a epiphany when he sees the Indians and let them kill Fitzgerald.?. It didn't matter if ElK Dog gave the final blow to end Fitzgerald life; he would have died bleeding as he was floating down the river.So many people praise this film for all its acting, photography, direction, etc, but those are all a disguise and a camouflage to cover up flat story. What is it you get walking away after watching this film?..what's the message here?. That revenge is the answer and it will bring you peace?.",Null,1,2,11 April 2016
Batman Begins," Batman finally Begins
","It took Warner Brothers 16 years to finally get it right; yes this is the film I have long waited for, where Batman finally begins!. I remember when the first Batman film came out in 1989, who can forget the hype and the marketing that went into that film; it was famous and popular long time before it even came out. I went to see it the first week it was released and I was very disappointed in fact I hated it and thought it was so badly made and Burton was the wrong director and I am sorry as much I like Keaton but he would be the last person I thought of as Batman; how can you take a super hero and make him smaller than what he was written? if anyone has ever read the original comic books of Batman and could see that Keaton is a far cry from what Bob Cane had in mind, and as I said earlier there was such a hype about 'Batman' that no matter who played him it would have still have been accepted; but if you rent it today you can see what a joke it is.Above all what the movie lacked was the origins of Batman; like Superman in 1978, where we saw superman as a little boy and how he came to earth; but Mr. Burton decided to skip all that in Batman; Batman was just given to us with out any background and he remained an enigma all through the sequels. Although Schumacher tried to bring some depth into it in the third one with Kilmer and an interesting cast but it still had a very campy and cartoonish look and feel to it.'Batman Begins' is truly a masterpiece; it is probably among the best written script I have ever seen for a super hero genre; this film delves into theme of fear and keeps a consistent paste as how it plays in the life of Bruce Wayne who becomes Batman who has his own demons i.e. Bats and how he turns that to form of terror. Bale who is among my favorite actors and was perfect for this role, he made Batman human; there was so many scenes of Wayne feeling he has failed and not sure and it was due to Bale's acting that make this character so believable and the same goes for the rest of the cast like Michael Cane, and Liam Neeson as Batman's teacher and later Nemesis.One of the most interesting aspect of this film was its score by Han Zimmer and James Newton Howard which complements the title of the film; it has a feel of something is about to begin; its like a first act of a symphony and it never goes beyond a certain point. Those scenes where Batman escapes the police jumping off the roof tops with his car are so well put together and so well scored; the music is a huge factor of those scenes and again its the really the high point of the film where we see Batman in some real action and its also ends on the same theme song.Christopher Nolan and David Goyer deserve to get an Oscar for this film; this Batman is a work of art and labor of love. I have seen it 3 times now and each time I even like it more for its lack of special effects and it focus on characters. This was a film I have long waited and argued to so many people that Batman genre was never depicted correctly in the big screen until now with this masterpiece. This film has such a classic Batman look of the original Batman and how it was drawn and I am so glad that finally someone at Warner Brothers believed that there has to be a beginning and maybe they can start over; because this is really where Batman Begins and I can only thank the film makers of this film and wish the best for the sequel in 2008.",Null,0,0,27 November 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Mr. and Mrs. ALIAS
","I heard so much about this film prior to its release and after I saw it I think its probably one of the dumbest movies I have seen this year. This is pretty much like the show 'Alias' but doesn't even have supporting cast to rescue it from the disaster that it really is. From the very opening scene where Pitt and Jolie are getting marriage counselling I felt they are just going through the lines like they are reading of some cards; you felt it was like fake acting and their whole interaction just got to be worse through out the whole movie; they just had no depth that would translate to some kind of chemistry. Most audiences are sold on the idea that just because these two stars have huge sex appeal,hence, that equals to screen chemistry and I am sorry to say that Ms. Jolie doesn't have any kind appeal even in a dumb movie like this. Pitt on the other hand is an actor who's game is raised by what others bring to the table; when he feels he is challenged his acting becomes better; even in a film like Ocean's 12 where he is having an affair with a cop 'Catherine Zeta-Jones' and those few scenes had much more chemistry than all the scenes in this movie; and that was a pure pop-corn movie yet it had many great moments. Again in an older film like Seven there was a great chemistry between Pitt and 'Gwyneth Paltrow' given that they were dating but they didn't even have to talk to each other on the screen; the same in 'Spy Game' with 'Catherine McCormack' the chemistry was in their interaction and by far richer than Ms. Jolie whom we are sold on this idea that she is this hot sexy thing that sizzles on the screen.I read some of the other reviews here and I feel I watched a whole other movie?. First the story of two people who meet in a hotel in south America both standing behind the door scared and not either suspecting the other as to why? then jump cut to married several years later and you have not even shown a series of shots of how those few years were like, their missions, or any clue as to one even suspecting another. You just are given these superficial scenes with Joile trying to do her best to convince you that she can act. I hate to compare but if you watch 'Alias' you can see 'Jennifer Garner' along with the whole cast really do their best in that one hour to bring depth no matter how bizarre the plot is; its her interactions with the rest of the cast that makes her believable, she can be tough and Daddy's little girl at the same time, she makes the character human and her face can take up the whole screen and you can read a lot in her expressions and I think she would have done a much better job in this film than Ms. Jolie. This is the same director who did 'Bourne Identity' which was a terrific film; the whole chemistry between Jason and Marie was developed so beautifully slowly but it was believable; I felt with all the action the interaction between them stood out and that's what made it 'Bourne a great action film. In Mr. and Mrs. Smith you don't even care to like the characters; this movie had potential to become much better film; there was so many scenes that could have been slowed down and more about the problems of two people in a marriage and yes at the same time being funny and a action film but its became one big joke and even when you see Joile shed a tear in a restaurant thinking she killed Pitt its quickly ruined by Pitt's surprise arrival and their brutal tango throwing knives across tables and not even one person noticing it?Lets face it this was just an idea of putting two box office stars together to make an action film with any script; because there is no story here that you care to even understand, it has no direction even as a comedy; I find the TV show 'Alias' more enjoyable and even more interesting than this stupid movie.",Null,8,15,5 July 2005
The Dark Knight Rises," 'Impossible' !
","When Bane sees the Batman burning sign on the wall he utters' 'Impossible', that's pretty much sums up most of this last chapter to Batman trilogy that began so great in the last two films.This last chapter was very very disappointing?. First lets look at the casting of 'Anne Hathaway' as the so-called 'Cat Woman'?. That was the biggest joke to me in the whole film. Anne Hathaway was trying so hard to play this street wise tough chick; almost over acting her scenes that just got worse. I am sorry to say she is not much to look at physically or in the face, with all the make up and sexy outfit; her over-acting with her fight scenes was just awful. I don't know how people get casted in a movie as are large as this, maybe its all about the right agent who can make the deals with people like director Nolan.Nolan did something similar in the second Batman by casting 'Maggie Gyllenhaal' as Rachel by replacing 'Katie Holmes' due to her pregnancy, but again Maggie Gyllenhaal was a miscast, she did not have the gracefulness and poise of the character of 'Rachel' who grew up like Bruce Wayne. Nolan casting 'Maggie Gyllenhaal' as Rachel is as bad as casting 'Anne Hathaway' as Cat Woman. My choice would have been 'Olivia Wilde' who is visually stunning to look at, as a Cat Woman should be. Olivia Wilde has a also has done films like 'Tron Legacy', where she is physically capable of a such a role. The second casting errors were 'Joseph Gordon-Levitt', who is working a lot these days, I just could not see him as 'John Blake' and John Blake does not become 'Robin' in the Batman story. There was also 'Matthew Modine' who really just walked through this film, he was awful even playing dead at the end.As far as the story, that's where it gets really bad and pot holes one after another. My first issue was why did we start 8 years into future, it's been four years since the last film, that is plenty of time for Batman to have gone missing. There is a scene where Batman goes to the hospital to see his doctor and his doctor shows him X-rays in how how badly he is hurting all over, he has no Cartilage in his knees along other issues such as even liver. So here is you are given information that Batman is not well. yet two minutes he is jumping out the window to see his old friend Commissioner Gordon, who is the most consistent character in all 3 films.So we have been informed that Bruce Wayne's injuries being Batman has finally caught up with him. Yet, when he has the fight scene with Bane, when Bane brakes his back and puts him the Pit of a prison. This is where the film really gets stupid; there is a time issue in this film from the time Batman has a broken back to the time he makes it back to Gotham. Again remember he is already in poor health with now a broken back, then his back heals very quick, then he tries to climb the pit and fails again with a bad back again, the he recovers so well to jump with a with out rope in a such a short time to make it back to Gotham. That is as Bane said best: IMPOSSIBLE.Then there is the character of 'Thalia' or Miranda, the daughter of Ra's Al Ghul. When Batman was beaten by Bane, she is still pretending to be Miranda; yet Bane has already taken over the city, she has no reason to pretend anymore, she has all she wants to destroy Gotham. Again, how long was Miranda/Thalia in custody while Batman healed?.It can not be 3 or 5 months considering the time the cops were trapped in the tunnel below, this is the biggest plot hole in the whole film. When Batman got stabbed by Miranda and sitting there listening her while she has the knife in him?. This is not a reaction of Batman who beats 10 men at a time; so no matter how shocking it was to find out she is the daughter of his former enemy, was it so hard to push her off when she is talking to him, considering Bane is also down and helpless?.There was several scenes and references to the 'Auto Pilot' of the Bat plane that has none. Yet we see the plan blow up while it drops the Atomic bomb, so where ever Batman jumped off in less two minutes of the bomb going off while in mid air it has to be a fast jump to survive, given the radiation of radius of a atomic bomb, again as Bane would say: IMPOSSIBLE. We are given this last sinister look of Batman while he looks at the sky as he explodes, we later see him in European Cafe across from Albert had mentioned. This is where I think the film really failed, why can't Batman die, why does he had to live? I really liked the character of Bane, I wish there was more scenes with him and Thalia to show her attraction to this insane character. However, we spent too much time with characters like 'Blake' and others like special ops caption Jone played by Daniel Sunjata, who got killed as soon he was on the screen, what was the purpose of these characters?I really don't know what happened with Nolan and what he was thinking when he did this last fill of Batman series? . When you watch this it makes you wonder if this is the same director who made the last two films, its really was a failure and poor way to end a great trilogy.",Null,7,14,17 December 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Worst of the trilogy
","I saw this film perhaps 3 or 4 times since 2012 as recent as 2018 again; it's a shame that I still feel it really failed as the final chapter of this great trilogy. I am Not a fan of Nolan as a director, he is become another studio puppet in the Hollywood machine and moved so far away from films like 'Momento', which I still hold to be his best film to date. However, I felt what he did with his version of Batman in the first two was really a great treatment of this comic book character, compare to the lame campy version of Tim Burton; that were just stupid. The second film 'The Dark Knight' was probably the best Batman film ever made, mostly due to the great story, its theme; casting of the late Heath Legder; whose performance as Joker will stand the test of time. However, this last chapter was incoherent from the start and not as thought out as the previous two. This film just felt incoherent in parts; some parts didn't make sense. Batman was almost absent half of this film and this 8 years gap was something else that didn't make sense either; where we see Bruce Wayne walking with a limp and kane in hand. The story had weird holes in it, when Bruce Wayne is seen by his doctor who is telling him how he has no cartilage in his arms and legs and yet, he brakes his back and then heals quick and goes back to save Gotham. That just didn't make sense at all. Why would Bane wait 5 months to blow up Gotham after he already disabled the city and Batman? what was the wait for?. There was also time line from the time Batman healed in the Pit prison, Miranda was with Fox Lucious, so all that time Bane just kept her prisoner? that did not make sense?. 
That time line from the moment broke his back to how he healed and jumped out of the pit was very unclear?...why would Bane and Miranda waste all that time to put on the charade?. I liked Tom Hardy as Bane'; he was actually the best thing that make this film worth while to watch, Hardy, has like Legder also has a this talent of creating very interesting insane characters; from the very beginning scene in the plane and his voice underneath hood was just engaged you into this Bane character. But my biggest problem in the casting was 'Anne Hathaway' as the 'Catwoman'???????. . I just could not wrap my mind around why this skinny Ugly duckling, who is all bones and nothing to look at, had no sex appeal, with that fake wig and droopy eyes that look like a crack head. What was Nolan thinking when he casting her among so many other choices like 'Olivia Wilde' or 'Rebecca FERGUSON' and many other beauties whom were closer to fit the character of Catwoman?. What was it about this below average actress who couldn't be sexy even with plastic surgery that even Warner brothers allowed her to be in it?. it just goes to prove what Mel Gibson and many others actors have said, that's its not about talent anymore in Hollywood, it's about who you know. Anyone with any common sense knows, you want Catwoman to be something the audience can't take theirs eyes off, not a sex object, but sexy; intelligent and charisma; Someone who has screen presence. Every time I watched this last Batman, I just couldn't stand watching 'Anne Hathaway', she just makes you want to turn off the TV; her acting was also just terrible. I wonder who did she blew in Hollywood to get this role?...this was the biggest miscasting for a picture that costed millions; but to cast this ugly little Jewish girl as Catwoman?. it was the worst choice to pick her as one of the major characters of this comic book genre, how far have we have gone from Michelle Pfeiffer; who was probably the best of all 3 people who played this character. All I got from 'Anne Hathaway' of this character was scum bag, trying so hard to act tough and smart; it was pathetic. I had no interest in what so ever. The second casting that was also wrong through this film was 'Marion Cotillard', whose career agenda, ever since she made name for herself in Hollywood, is to be in every major film in the last decade with every leading man, it's not about work anymore, its about money and fame for her. I recall in 2010 to 2011 reading about problems and issues with production on this last Batman; how things were not going well for Nolan. This last slot felt it was rushed; not as planned and thought out the other two. It was just all over the place and Nolan was riding on the success of the previous two. Hollywood Studios also knew, once they have a product like Batman and huge FANBOY audience, people will come and see the film, no matter how awful it is, they come because its 'BATMAN'. When I read some of the dumb reviews on this site, praising Nolan and calling this film a 'masterpiece'?.., it's just goes proves the FANBOY club is huge, fanboys who just watch without thinking; who are clueless about film making and story structure, this site is infested with FANBOYS for many directors like 'Nolan' and 'Tarrantino'; we now live in a time where every dumb ass who has no knowledge of film history, or film genre is now a film critic on this site. Bale was the best actor who played this character and I doubt anyone can top that again in years to come, it's time Warner Brothers really gives this Batman films a rest. As much as I like and respect Ben Aflec; but he is another miscast for this character. To me Batman ended with Bale but this last chapter was a failure.",Null,1,5,18 August 2018
300," Insult to the Persians
","I don't know why Hollywood is allowed to make up it's own human history; especially in a time where majority of society won't even bother to read a book. This film was a remake of the 1962's '300 Spartans', which was a better film in it's approach. I found the '300' to be visually stunning, like one big CGI/Pulp Painting in motion, derive 'Frank Miller''s Sin City style, but it failed in depicting the 'Persians' and in fact it is an insult to the Persian History because they were portrayed as this evil dark people as if you are watching 'The Lord of the Rings'. What makes Greeks superior to Persians is like saying White people are superior to Black people or any other culture; which goes to show you how stupid and sick are the people who write such crap, people like Frank Miller and those to make such a film in a time when the middle east is already has a negative image as the center of terror. It is a tragedy what is happened to Hollywood and the more we go forward in time the dumber it gets.",Null,2,9,14 May 2007
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Max with a Feminist Disguise
","I have always liked the 'Mad Max' films, I like George Miller as a director because he created a vision of a apocalyptic post nuclear violent future world with 'Mad Max' films. I respect him for the fact that he never let anyone else direct other sequels of MM films other than himself. Miller returned after 30 years for this long awaited sequel and among all the directors(Scott,Spielberg, Lucas) whom attempted to do sequels with CGI, Miller somehow managed to refuse that option and went old school with a real crew, stunts in the desert and at 70 years of age he created a masterpiece with 'Fury Road'. I just saw this recent 'Mad Max: Fury Road' with Tom Hardy, which at first when I read he was casted as Max I thought it was a odd choice but now having watched this film I am sorry to say that I feel he was a terrible choice. I hate to compare one actor to another, I liked Mel Gibson because he made Max more interesting and charismatic on the screen, where as Tom Hardy seemed lost or confused with this role. I have seen Hardy playing these very oddball sociopaths roles like 'Bronson' or 'Bane' (in Batman) or the simple-minded Bob in the 'Drop'; I think his acting ranges only between those types. Hardy seemed to only to play the tough brutal Max. I heard in a interview there was not full script for him and it was mostly story boarded but that is an actor's dream to improvise. So he can blame there was no script but that missing script had more lines for Charlize Theron and the other characters like NUX than Max whom the movie was suppose to be about. This was a great action film, a true masterpiece of its kind, Miller not relying on CGI was what made it great, however it lacked a coherent narrative in parts. Also the casting of these super model looking girls as breeding mothers dressed like they were in some Vouge magazine shoot out in the desert just didn't fit when it came to casting. The photography had a comic book look compare to they way Miller had that barren landscape in 'Road Warrior' which complemented the theme of a post apocalyptic world rather than this primary colors, glossy blue sky that looked like a Disney movie. Although the sets and cast of characters of these various characters like 'Nux' and 'The Bullet Farmer' were very interesting and he really got the comic book look come alive on the screen. This movie was disguised first with action then with a feminist theme; but it was really more of marketing strategy to appeal and draw a wider female audience. To have female hero 'Furiosa', a freedom fighter battling against an oppressive male regime. Theron made this character tough she looked like a an action figure; compare to Sigourney Weaver in 'Aliens' as 'Ripley' with non-model looks was only wearing a unisex worker's uniform was smart and forceful. This was suppose to be a Mad Max film but 'Furiosa' became the center of this film, the action disguised the viewer to forget it was a Mad Max movie, he was just a passenger, it was like a Houdini magic act to suddenly convert this movie into a Feminist action film; sorry to say that was another cloak to think someone like 'Furisoa' is a feminist role model. In 'Road Warrior' and 'Beyond the Thunderdome' there was a lot of more dialogue spoken by Max than this film. Miller was the person who co-wrote those first 3 Max films stories and scripts, so how come this there was no lines for the new Max?. I feel the Mad Max that I knew was missing on the screen. Hardy was this mute, brooding and angry Max that felt he didn't want to be in this movie. That scene where he first find the girls washing with the water hose by the truck he was just moaning to get the wire cutter. Those fight scenes with Theron were stupid in a way, because Furiosa saw Max was a prisoner and tied up and used as blood bank, he was not part of war boys, so why fight Max?. The old Max was more smarter in how to assess the situation around him with humor. There is no sense of humor to Tom Hardy's Max at all, he is more muscles than brains. The plot would have been more interesting if Max had captured and returned these women with NUX to bargain and exchange to get his car and fuel and then rescued them back.Overall I liked the film itself, the visuals and most of all Charlize Theron as 'Furiosa' who really carried most of the weight of this film but I can't call this a Mad Max movie. I hope Mr. Miller either finds a new Max or breaths some life into Tom Hardy's version of Max with a script that Hardy can read and follow, because casting should not just be about how big a star is to sell the film. My choice for Max would have been either another Australian actor like 'Sam Worthington' who has been in a number of action films like 'Clash of Titans' or 'Luke Evans' (who was in 'Dracula: Untold) that really surprised me as how good an actor he is, his reactions has more depth than Hardy could ever conjure a grin. The Mad Max films are now made for a new generation who probably don't care about depth or acting but more about the action, so I hope Miller started a trend for films to be shot with a real setting and crew instead the illusion of CGI.",Null,3,9,15 August 2015
