Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very-very unpopular opinion: I liked the new Star Wars movies from George Lucas! :-)
","(Spoiler alert) Very-very unpopular opinion: I liked the new Star Wars movies from George Lucas! :-)Episode I: The Phantom Menace; Episode II: Attack of the Clones; Episode III: Revenge of the Sith were all cool I think. Yeah, Jar-Jar is ͡ bit stupid, I did not really like that creature either - however in the pretty-dark Star Wars universe there can be some stupid / funny species too, because why the hell not? He takes brings some bright light in it, and compared to his silliness the evil characters (the Emperor, Vader, Maul, etc.) look even more dark and menacing.But Palpatine was done very well, just like Anakin, Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon Jinn, Mace Windu, Count Dooku, Yoda and others. The battle scenes were awesome, and if you compare the Jedi fights to the older movies, the new ones look waaaaay better - the original Jedi fights are like the fights in really old pirate movies (cc. around the 1920's), while the new ones use force jumps, force pull-push, dual wielding, shaolin-like techniques and many more really good-looking stuff. Different people, different opinions I guess...Also, this whole circlejerk around 'George Lucas is ͡ bad movie maker, bad artist, bad person' is pretty strange. I mean yeah, he had very different financial and directorial options while making the original trilogy, and then the 3 prequels. But c'mon guys: he started the whole STAR WARS saga!!! He should get some credit or admiration for it. If one does not like his latest works, that is also OK, there are tons of fan- fictions to enjoy instead. Leave Britney Lucas alone... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Also now Disney will make some new parts, we will see what they can add to the Star Wars universe: prepare for Mickey Mouse Jedi Knight III... Nah, just kidding, I think they will also make some good ones. Disney employs professionals, and they can differentiate between 'child movies' and adult fantasy movies, so I think they will be really good. 'Pirates of the Caribbean' is also ͡ Disney franchise, and it has some darker parts too, definitely not aimed toward little children.To sum it up: the Star Wars universe is big: there is the Force in it, darkness, light, evil characters, funny characters, battle scenes, love scenes... If you do not like some of these, you can always choose another book, movie or game, there are tons of them. Personally I really like Phantom Menace, and all the other new movies too.",10,2,4,3 August 2014
Lone Survivor," Good vs. Evil - is it so simple?
","This movie is not about heroes, it is about propaganda. It is like some bad old Western movie, where the Indians are just evil scum, who should be shot at every possible occasion, and where all the cowboys are automatically good.Face it: if you go fighting in a foreign country, you have a good chance to die. Does not really matter much if you train a lot, have good weapons and such. You can just get shot like a dog, like it happened in case of thousands of soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. USA keeps making wars since the end of World War II, and as such, portraying the 'heroes' fighting in Afghanistan is just stupid and hypocritical. They do not defend their own country,they went to play GI Joe to another culture's homeland - and it has consequences.Although there are evil people in every country, this movie shows it like all the Americans are just friggin' awesome dancing around, training like hell, having fun team events, and generally being 'cool', while all those bad-bad-stupid Arabic fighters should just die - as they hinder the Big Mission. We do not really understand from the movie what is the purpose of Big Mission - but who cares? They are fighters, aces, marines, and hell, they need some success!!! The brown guys must be bad, because they dare to fight back against the good marines. Well.. imagine if the USA would be attacked some day - would they also fight back? Are the local fighters automatically just evil for defending their own territories? The answer of this movie is: HELL YES!!! So they must die.They show a little boy (as possibly the only good Arabic guy?), and a lot of other evil brown-skinned fighters. There is a lot of fighting, and if an USA marine gets wounded - they show how everyone is doing everything to save his life. The movie does not care much about the brown-skinned ones, they can just get shot and die. This movie is empty propaganda, and such deserves no stars, but there is no 0 point possible, so I give 1.",1,28,58,18 April 2014
