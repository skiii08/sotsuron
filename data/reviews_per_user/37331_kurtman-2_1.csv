Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The real Menace, is in coming to the realisation that this film (or any other really,) can not live up to all the hype it's been given.
","The real Menace is what sneaks up on you like a lurking phantom as this film unfolds. It is the realisation that this film cannot live up to all the hype it's been given. It is, none the less, at least a 9 out of 10. The movie opens strong and reveals a thrilling new display of the power of a Jedi Knight. In the fast moving first few  scenes, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn leads the apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi in a fight out of an ambush aboard a Federation Vessel. The audience is warned to buckle up for the ride to come. While the high-energy isn't constant throughout the film, the visual display is. This piece DOES live up to the rumours of fascinating new worlds and vast epic cities that leave the viewer wanting just another second to take in each scene. The unfortunate part of this story is that it is preceded by 20 years of the out-of-this-world success and popularity of its sequels. No film, however great, can compete with that in 2 hours on a Wednesday evening. It does however deliver some very memorable scenes. The most talked about surely to be the Pod Race. This thrill-ride pits young Anakin, against a miry collection of native Tatooinian creatures, in a race literally for his life. The Pods, are home made contraptions (I use that term very loosely) that are basically two afterburning jet engines towing a dune buggy frame that contains more electronics than a stealth fighter. In short, this race makes Ben Hur look like a royal wedding. Episode One covers all the bases too. The comedic Jar Jar Binks, while a little corny at times for the adult crowd, is certain to be a hit with the younger set. Unfortunately they will be driving adults everywhere battty, trying to imitate his almost baby-like pidgin English.Lucas has not lost touch with real filmmaking either. While it is clear, the emphasis on this film is special effects both visual and aural, he manages to capture our hearts with the love between a mother and son. When Anakin is freed from his slave master, his freedom ironically separates him from his only family. A bittersweet few scenes here, that don't turn on the waterworks like a Julia Roberts flick, but do manage to tug at us enough to bring us off the roller-coaster for a breather before slowly climbing back on for another big ride at the finale. This movie didn't follow the standard Hollywood cookie cutter plot. There was no predicting what will happen next. But it is also not the next great epic to be lauded for years to come. Rather, it is an introduction. The beginning of the epic story yet to be told. In the end, we are left wanting more. More of the story not really told here. More of the story yet to come. We're waiting George.",Null,0,0,25 May 1999
