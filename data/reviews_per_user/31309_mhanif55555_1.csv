The King's Speech," Unjust
","The film did not do justice to the person of the duke of Windsor.He was not such a wimpy toy boy as portrayed in the role played by a person totally unsuitable for it.The mere suggestion that he could be manipulated and forced to make decisions in haste and without weighing the pros and cons contradicts the facts of history..He was raised in Queen Victori's lap and had been raised by three generations of royals, groomed to be The King and Emperor.Destiny took a different course...matters of heart ! but he was no liar.His abdication was a tragedy....and a loss!One of the reasons for this apparently biased characterization maybe the presence of the generation that had suffered the dreadful tortures of WW2 and somehow link the person and actions of the British monarch to the events that followed his abdication.But,I think we cant make a single person the scapegoat for the mistakes of so many and for so long.I respect the man, his politics is none of my business, I admire his courage and truthfulness.He might get his rightful place in history sometime in future,Amen.",Null,0,1,2 March 2011
