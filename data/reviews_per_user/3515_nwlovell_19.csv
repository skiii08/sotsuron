The Devil's Advocate," pacino sux as usual.....4/10
","People give Pacino way too much credit.  The guy doesn't act, he plays himself over and over again.  And he doesn't even do that well anymore.  And don't get me started on Keeanu.......oh man, is he painful to listen to. Anyway, as a movie, DA is basically a poor version of The Firm......which was no great movie either.  But hey, at least Connie and Charlize are great eye candy.  This movie is not worth renting on video, and barely worth watching if on tv for free.",Null,0,1,11 December 2002
Scarface," f.... him, and f...... him, and f..... everybody else!
","Oh boy, if you view this flick as harmless ultraviolence entertainment with misplaced casting and anachronistic music etc, it is an ok ripoff/ remake of Godfather complete with Pacino.... but set in drugrunning Florida.  As for the acting, well let's just let M.Pfeiffer sum it up in her own words, 'I still think people will find out that I'm really not very talented. I'm really not very good. It's all just been a big sham.'  Yep, and she delivered just that in this flick.  Still, the film is worth a dvd rental. 5/10.",Null,0,1,18 June 2003
Minority Report," Good video rental......if u like Total Recall
","People seemed to fall victim to the Hollywood Hype Machine on this flick. Look, it is a Spielberg.....that's all.  He rips off Blade Runner, Fifth Element etc.  Don't expect anything great and you won't be disappointed.  At least people aren't expecting Tom Cruise to act anymore.....so no disappointment there.  Sure the product placements are irritating, but the Bond films have them too.  Sure the ever-so-socialist Spielberg makes it a point, coincidence of course, to name one of the angelic precogs, Daschle. A plug for the heinous Democrat Tom Daschle?  (Naaaaah, never!)  Other funky wierdness at play......can't be pure coincidence that Caroline Lagerfelt has the monster mole to the right of her philtrum that is focused on by the camera exactly as happens with the Wonder Years kid in the recently released Goldmember movie.  A little bit of cross-pollination movie marketing going on there?  I dunno...but I do rate movies as:  Must see in theatre, Ok on video, or Total Waste of Time.   This rates as a good video rental.  The concept is cool.  I would give it a 6/10 for entertainment despite its many flaws and the almost unbearable Spielberg.",Null,0,0,15 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," only Yoda rules.......
","Hmmmmmmmm.......Lucas a film-maker, shouldn't be.   Yoda is cool, and the art deco buildings and speeders and some of the soundtrack are cool.  That is all for positives.  The story exists not.  The dialogue......well let's just say that I haven't been that embarrassed by pathetic romantic banter since the abominable Titanic.  Anakin is a wanker.  Portman gets better and better through the film as she talks less, and wears less clothing. Unfortunately, she has no racque to speak of.  Lucas rips me of with crappy dialogue and story......and then doesn't even have the decency to give me some worthwhile T&A to look at. Don't bother seeing it.   2/10.",Null,0,0,1 August 2002
10 Things I Hate About You," 10 things I hate about teen flix 5/10
","not worth renting on video, but an ok flick if it comes on tv and you happen to be sitting in front of boobtube mending your sox.  nothing wrong with these simplistic teenflix that having the chix get naked wouldn't fix!!",Null,0,0,25 November 2002
The Bourne Identity," male version of La Femme Nikita
","If you have seen and like La Femme Nikita and the various Bond flicks, then you will like BI.  It is sort of a male version of La Femme Nikita (the original French version is better than the USA version with Bri Fonda). Good action scenes that don't really jump the shark until the very end. Good thing they didn't give Franka Potente any real lines and character to work with, otherwise, she would spin circles around the ever-flat Matt Damon.   If you read my reviews, you know I rate movies into three bins: Must-see in theatre, Ok for a video rental, Waste of time.    BI rates OK-video.  But I didn't feel badly having spent $10 to see it in the theatre.   6/10",Null,0,1,17 June 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Deep Six it
",More Hollywood dreck star-vehicle stuff for Clowney and Hoolya Roberts.  Her movies would have meaning if she got naked.  And Clowney has yet to act.  He gets more mileage out of just being himself on film than Robert Wagner or the 6-million dollar man.......whatever his name was....currently residing in the Where Are They Now file.  This movie barely rates worth seeing on video.,Null,0,1,28 May 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," ah crikey, hong kong kung fu phighting all over again. 5/10
","laughable dubbed dialogue.  silly supernatural schlock.  a comicbook of hu flung pu fighting scenes.  just cuz fatso Ebert has jumped on the popularity bandwagon and sung the praises of this flick and genre, don't be fooled....it is more of the same ole ting.  What saves this movie and makes it worth a rental (albeit barely) is the visually stunning scenery.  There are many simply gorgeous landscape shots I wish I could print and hang on my wall!",Null,0,1,21 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," 5/10 good DVD rental. Golm developed well....
","Yes, they certainly did a good job with the Golm character and computerization.  All of the computerization landscape and animals etc were well done.  And the acting is as good as can be expected with such stilted dialogue.  Don't worry if someone is kicking your seat, coughing, or crunching candy next to you.......missing any of this dialogue doesn't matter.  As a matter of fact, I wore earplugs through the second half of the movie to save myself from the headache that the endless parade of battle scenes was giving me.  I guess when the producers lay out so many millions they want the surefire draw of bombastic Hong Kong kung fu broadsword swinging noise that will bring back 11 year old action patrons over and over.  I suggest you rent it on DVD so you can skip forward past much of the battle scenes which should have been cut to shrink the movie by 30-40 minutes.  But you would be better served to buy and read the books instead. Authors don't have to resort to noise and battle scenes to sew a great story together.  And movie producers only think they can.",Null,0,0,27 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Medium weak
","This movie is probably thoroughly enjoyable if you are female or a gay male. Otherwise, skip it.  The beginning was too frenetic.  Later I enjoyed about 10 minutes of it, another 10 minutes were bearable, the rest was a waste of good laundry time.",Null,0,1,4 June 2001
Mulholland Drive," Good one
","Great Lynch.  Definitely one to catch on video, not at the theatre....cuz you will want to rewind a couple of scenes to watch again.  Some gorgeous singing, excellent girl-girl scene.......and the cowboy is yet another in the pantheon of Lynchoid characters who will lodge in your filmbanks like an epiphany.  'If you do good, you will see me one more time........'",Null,0,0,29 April 2002
From Hell," taint..........hell, but taint great either. 4/10
",Not worth renting on vdo.  But worth a watch if comes on tv for free. Heather is wasted cuz she doesnt get naked.  Depp is ok......but can't save this movie from itself.  The flick is very good on an art student level with interesting directing techniques/visuals.  Unfortunately the cutting makes for an uninteresting plot development.  By the end.....I just wanted it to end.,Null,1,2,16 December 2002
Groundhog Day," Bill Murray's best film. Period. 10/10
","BM's underrated masterpiece is one of those rare films you will want to watch many times.  Only a handful of films rate that way with me.  All guys nod along that, 'yup, that IS what I would try to do if I had the same day to live over and over again...'  It is funny, droll, touching, thought-provoking.  I have probably seen it a dozen times, and I still am able to pick out overlooked gems from this perfectly cast movie.",10,1,2,28 January 2003
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Now, now.....everyone just relax and enjoy the film
","Reviewers act as though we should be en guarde lest such fascist control creep into our lives on cats paws. And yet, it is happening all around us. My taxes have been going up and up. Gubment spending on socialist programs to get themselves re-elected increases steadily. We frogs have yet to jump out of the pot of slowly heating water to protest. Heck we don't even demand term limits for socialists like Kennedy and Barney Frank. Next Hitlery Clinton will nationalize the health care industry and force you to pay more for it....you know, for 'the children's sake!' America the free, indeed. As for the film, for my taste, it is overdone in the homosexual and scatological shock categories. Certainly don't rent it if you want to see nude chicks. Rent Swimming Pool instead. This review written 7/27/7 before Evita Clinton's rise to the presidency.",3,2,10,27 July 2007
Total Recall," Consider zat a divorce
",Arn's best film.  A great concept film that has improved with time because of the laughable over-acting by the supporting cast....especially at Rekall. Sharon Stone brought smiles in her big 80's hair and aerobic queen wannabe outfit.  A better rendition of the amnesiac agent than the recent Bourne Identity.  7/10.,Null,0,1,21 June 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," mind the drool..... 5/10.
","I have never read the books, and probably never will....then again, I am not 9 years old.  That said, the movie is watchable even for an adult, but the target market is clearly the same as that of the books.  And it should be. The sorting hat is the best scene.  Rickman is brilliant.  Thumbs up to Rowling for some clever devices that should bring smiles to all ages. Decent video rental.   5/10.",Null,0,0,12 September 2002
Heat," good vdo rental 7/10
","A collection of fine performances turned in by all.  Good plot, decent action sequences--if a tad Holly'd up and over the top.  Only negative, and it is fortunately a minor one, is the silly Hollywood screenwriters' insistance upon inserting the ubiquitous and unnecessary 'baby' at the end of some otherwise very clean and entertaining dialogue.  I mean, really......who says 'baby' with a straight face these days?  If you want a really bad case of stilted dialogue, rent Heist by David Mamet.....truly cringe-worthy.  Better yet, don't rent it......just take my word for it.",7,0,0,12 November 2002
Windtalkers," breaks wind
",Am I allowed to say this flick blose donkeys?  Cage is over-exposed and over-rated.  Blacklist this dork already!  You know by now how I rate movies:  Must see in theatre/Ok for video/Waste of time.  Windtalkers is a waste of your time and money.  Play cards instead.....or do some laundry.,Null,1,2,19 June 2002
Donnie Darko," Let there be darko...
","I rate movies into 1/3 categories:  Must see at theatre, Good video rental, waste of time. DD rates as a good video rental.  Jake G is perfectly cast as DD.  Much better fit in this role than as Bilbo Baggins....but that is another issue. The 'science' in DD doesn't fly, so don't look for any time travel enlightenment here.........Drew Barrymoron produced it remember.  The film is very well directed......that is the strength of the film.  Watch for Kelly in future efforts.      8/10",Null,0,0,29 July 2002
