Requiem for a Dream," Not a feel-good movie, but definitely a good movie
","I really loved Requiem for a Dream.  It's a film with true emotion and when the credits start to roll you have to feel something.  It's definitely not a happy movie, and those who don't like dark subject matter or unhappy endings may be squeemish.  But for the rest of us this is a true journey.  We see the characters battle with drug addiction and the heightened problems that accompany it.  The acting, direction, characters, and story are all superb. I highly recommend.",9,0,1,5 June 2003
