The Devil's Advocate," Great movie!!!
","The quality of this movie came as a big surprise to me.  I thought this would just be another attempt for Keanu Reeves to try and make a good movie, but I was wrong.  The suspense was great, if a bit cheesy at times.  Pacino gave an awesome performance, as usual.  Also great performances from the supporting cast(you'll recognize a lot of well known faces).  This was definately one of the better horror/thriller movies of the 90's.  The film is definately not for all tastes, but horror lovers will eat it up. **** out of *****.",Null,2,2,11 March 2003
Requiem for a Dream," Very disturbing and a somewhat overrated, but still worth a look if you have the stomach for it
","I was expecting this film to be a little bit better, considering its rated like #25 in the 250, but all it really was is a bunch of repeated disturbing images that take front seat to the interesting storyline.  Ellen Burstyn plays an elderly Brooklyn woman who becomes addicted to diet pills, and fantasizes her own dream world, at the same time her distant son(Jared Leto) is having his own drug problems.  The repeated visuals are very weird and are bound to stay in your memory for a long time.  The only real reason to see this film is to see a really weird, and somewhat visually fascinating film.  I cant give it any more than a 6/10.",6,1,2,16 September 2003
50 First Dates," Not a great Adam Sandler movie, but still watchable and entertaining
","After a string of truly poor comedies(Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds, and Anger Management), Adam Sandler somewhat gets back on his feet with this silly, but good natured comedy. Sandler plays sea animal veterinarian living in Hawaii who enjoys having several short flings with tourists. He spots an attractive Drew Barrymore in a diner one morning and strikes up a romance with her. He goes back again to meet her the next morning, but she has no idea who he is. He realizes that her short term memory gets erases every night and she starts out with a clean slate every morning. He figures that she is worth his time, so he tries to go back to the diner every morning and win her over again and again. The story consists of one running joke that quickly runs thin, but there are still enough funny/touching moments to make it worthwhile. Dan Aykroyd has a fun cameo as Barrymore's doctor and Sean Astin is a hoot as her brother. 6/10.",6,1,2,24 May 2005
Friday Night Lights," Terrific Sports Drama
","This is one of the few thoroughly well made sports dramas. Billy Bob Thornton gives one of his best performances as the small town high school football coach that is determined to see his team succeed. We get to see all of the disappointments and mishaps that are involved with sports as well as all of the tension and heartache that occurs behind the scenes. The aspect that I admired most about this film was that it didn't rely on happy endings and romance to win the audience over. It is a realistic film that tells its story like it is, without any gimmicks or fancy tricks. Tim McGraw was terrific as one of the players' abrasive and abusive fathers. This is a film that tells it like it is. ***1/2 out of ****.",9,0,2,6 July 2005
The Big Lebowski," Hugely Enjoyable
","I have wanted to see this movie for a long time now, but I was a little leary, because the two other Coen movies I saw(The Hudsucker Proxy and Miller's Crossing) kinda sucked, but this film is a huge improvement over them.  Although the plot is rather messy, the film is very funny and charming, I loved Jeff Bridges' character 'The Dude'.  Since then I have seen 'Fargo', 'Blood Simple' , and 'Raising Arizona', the only dissapointment of them was 'Blood Simple'.  Some people will find this movie way too strange and stupid, but others will love it.  I'll give it a 7.5 out of 10.",Null,0,1,3 April 2003
Fight Club," Yuck!!
","Wow, what boring, repulsive and overrated movie.  I have always kind of avoided this film because the whole idea sounded kinda stupid, but not only was it stupid, it was gross and disturbing, I mean the whole seen with the human fat, just plain disgusting.  Dont even get me started on the ridiculus plot.  I hated the other Fincher film 'The Game' even worse than this one though, I hope 'Se7en' is a giant step above these two movies.   Overall I think this was the most overrated film of the decade. *1/2 out of ****",Null,1,2,22 February 2003
As Good as It Gets," One of the best films I have ever seen
","From the first time I saw this movie I loved it. The story is so great, and I could really relate to the characters.  Jack Nicholson was hilarious as the man with OCD, Helen Hunt was great, and so was Greg Kinnear.  This is a simply wonderful movie that everyone should see.  This movie was directed by James L. Brooks, and if you havent already, you should see some of his other work(Terms Of Endearment,Broadcast News), because they have simalar tones, and they both have Jack Nicholson in a supporting role.",Null,0,1,28 July 2002
The English Patient," Not good enough
","When a movie recieves best picture at the academy awards, I expect a great film, this was not, as a matter of fact, I have a hard time saying that its good.  What it is, is a wandering, poorly paced melodrama about shallow characters.  There are a few breathtaking moments scattered throughout this overblown picture, but not nearly enough to make up for its weaknesses.  I feel bad that Willem Dafoe(usually a very un-hollywood-like actor) took part in this overblown picture.  This film should not have even been nominated for best picture, let alone win it.  My Best Picture of 96: Fargo.  Overall this is not worthy of the hype.  5 out of 10, to be generous.",4,5,11,12 June 2003
The Fifth Element," Visually stunning, but lacking in everything else
","I could never understand the appeal for this film, it was has a much higher rating than 'Independance Day', the big action/sci-fi hit from the summer before, which I, and most other critcs agree, is a better film.  The plot of this movie is absolutely mind numbing, aliens are ready to destroy earth, and Bruce Willis and his gang go to destroy them.  Throw in a few real oddball characters to make it even weirder, and a whole load of futuristic images, and you have 'The Fifth Element'.  Don't get me wrong, its fun, but never take it seriously, or expect anything great, because its not.  So just sit back and be prepared for something real weird and incoherent.  My user rating: 6.1/10, mostly for the futuristic stuff.",6,1,2,23 August 2003
A Bridge Too Far," Decent war flick
","I know that quite a bit of work and money went into this film, and unfortunately it fizzled at the box office and lost quite a bit of money. It's not a bad film, mostly due to the excitement of seeing all of those familiar faces.  A lot of the action scenes drag, but the enthusiasum of the characters make up for that.  I have a feeling that making this film was a lot like trying to gain control of those bridges, a difficult gamble. Overrall I dont regret watching it.  If you decide to watch it, dont expect anything excellent, but you may enjoy it.  6.5 out of 10.",7,1,2,8 April 2003
Barry Lyndon," A real treasure!!
","Out of all of the Stanley Kubrick movies this is the one that you hear about the least.  It's a real shame because this was one of the ones that I enjoyed the most.  This is probably the most beautiful epic I have ever seen.  Almost every scene is absolutely breathtaking, with terrific scenery and stunning Academy Award winning cinematography.  Even if you don't completely follow the plot, this film can still be highly enjoyed for its visual effect.  One of the few films of such beauty.  ***1/2 out of ****.",8,5,7,2 December 2003
Full Metal Jacket," One Of The Most Disturbing Films I've seen in a long time(possible spoilers)
","I'm not saying that this isn't a great war film, because it is, but I'm just warning people that some of the graphic images in this film will take a very long time to get out of your head. The first half is very poignant as well as funny. It shows the basic training and focuses mainly on a very sad soul by the name of Private Pyle(Vincent D'Onofrio of 'Men In Black', and 'The Cell' in an outstanding performance) who gets picked on so badly by the drill sergeant(R. Lee Ermey) and the rest of the soldiers that he goes insane. From that point on it is an extremely bloody, vivid, and realistic experience. But some of gunshots are so overly graphic that they will remain in your memory for a very long time. Despite all of this, this is still one of the better Vietnam films. I actually liked it even more than 'Platoon'. My rating: 8/10.",Null,0,0,23 September 2003
Romeo + Juliet," An Overrated piece of trash, *1/2 out of ****
","I have avoided this movie for quite a while now, but after watching it I wished I had avoided it forever!!! First of all to add a pop atmosphere and music was a big mistake, because it didn't work at all. Second of all the acting was awful, especially DiCaprio who looked like a student reading out of a boring textbook. Paul Sorvino and Brian Dennehy who I think are both great actors were wasted in cameos, as was John Leguiziamo. I'm glad Claire Danes' career shattered because she is a pretty bad actress, although she's not bad to look at. Overall I think this movie was a piece of trash and would never watch it again. *1/2 out of ****",1,16,36,14 February 2003
Predator," Best Science Fiction thriller ever
","I finally saw this film, and I have to say that I loved it! The action is great,and the graphics on the Predator deserved an oscar. The plot is plain and simple, just the way I like it. I think this is Arnold's best film next to the Terminator's. If you like Arnold, this is a must see!  I also think the 7.2 rating is too low, I think it should be right up in the top 250 with the Terminators. 9.5 out of 10",9,1,1,1 September 2002
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Robin Williams' best movie!
","I finally got around to seeing this movie a few months back, and I thought it was great. It's very funny, and it has a great story. If youre a fan of Robin Williams, this movie is a must see.",8,2,4,19 July 2002
American Pie," You call 'Dumb and Dumber' stupid and crude, and then you go call this intellegent??!!!!!
","This comment is mostly for Roger Ebert and that James Bertinelli guy.  It's very interesting that most of the big critics liked this movie, I found it to be one of the most insulting, unfunny pieces of trash ever made, with no redeeming qualities.  There is one funny scene, the one where they give the kid the exlax, and that is it, as good as it gets.  It just dont get it, I thought 'Dumb and Dumber' was a classic comedy, it had a plot, many, many laughs, and some heart, but this had none of that, and its considered a classic, I dont think so.  2 out of 10.",2,2,4,15 June 2003
The Thing," Superb and extemely underated horror film
","Wow, what a thrilling unusual horror film. This film was a complete failure at the box office when it was released, but it shouldnt have been. It is much more thrilling than most other horror films and thrillers, the antartic setting also helps create an eerie atmosphere. The cast is also great. If you like horror movies, this is a must see. 10 out of 10",8,0,1,28 October 2002
American Psycho," Excellent Movie!!!, definately the best of 2000.
","I have wanted to see this movie for quite some time now, primarily for Willem Dafoe(although he is only in a few scenes), when I finally saw it I loved it.  It's an excellent journey into a crazy persons mind.  At times it can be disturbing but its still an excellent movie.  Christian Bale's performance was terrific, too bad he's not in many other great movies.  This film is definately not for all tastes though.  9 out of 10.",9,1,3,22 February 2003
The Patriot," More Nonsense
","I hate when they go and make a historical film like this, it all seems so campy and artificial.   Mel Gibson sleepwalks through his role, as does the rest of the cast.  I tried to like it, I really did, but It just seemed to superficial to win me over.  Its too bad because a lot of money went into making this film, but I know it made a lot of money too, so that's a lot of people's money being wasted.  I wouldnt recommend this fabricated nonsense.  ** out of ****.",4,1,2,6 June 2003
Dark City," Movies don't get much better than this!!!!
","What an excellent movie, from the first time I heard about it I knew I would love it, and I did!!!  It starts out with Rufus Sewell asleep in a bathtub in a dark, mysterious world, then several people are murdered, and then he is accused of killing them, after this, the movie unfolds into an amazing mix of sci-fi, mystery, and horror, and not to mention breathtaking action, with outstanding scenery.  This is the kind of movie where all parts of the story do not need to be completely coherent, sort of like 'The Fifth Element', but this is much, much better.  I can not say enough good things about this movie, certainly the most breathtaking sci-fi I have seen.  Its not ruined by overlength or stupid subplots, its all to the point and extremely fascinating.  I have to give it **** out of ****, and I have only given 3 other movies that rating.  Go see it now!!!!",10,0,3,3 June 2003
The Usual Suspects," It loves itself too much
","This is a movie that is too smart for its own good.  Everything in this film just seems so cocky self indulged.  The plot is too confusing, and it has too many characters.  The only part that took my breath away was that final line from Kevin Spacey.  I dont believe this is like #10 on the top 250, that is way, way to high. I give it a 5.",5,8,16,5 June 2003
Independence Day," Not the best sci-fi/action flick, but still pretty good
","Independence Day is not a great film, the acting is OK, and the action scenes do drag on a bit, but it's still a fun film to watch. The cast is better than a lot of other movies like it. When I watched Independence Day, I expected just a little bit more, but it's still pretty good. I'll give it a 6 out of 10.",Null,0,2,25 June 2002
The Dirty Dozen," Pretty good, but falls apart in the last quarter
","This was never really a classic, just an entertaining war/adventure film. All star cast and good action made this one a huge box office hit.  It hasnt aged real well, but its still fairly good.  It does drag on in the last quarter, which puts a damper on the overall quality of the film.  It's not a must see, but if you like the cast, go for it.  ***1/2 out of *****, or 7/10.",7,1,2,16 August 2003
Legends of the Fall," Very good movie
","This is a movie that I avoided for a while, but then decided to finally see it, im glad I did.  The scenery was beautiful, the acting was superb(especially Hopkins), and the cast was great.  It was very sad at times, especially when Brad Pitt came home to see his father(Hopkins) had a severe stroke.  Julie Ormand was very pretty and this only helped the movie even more.  It is a little slow at times, but that's OK, still a great movie.  *** out of ****.",Null,0,2,9 March 2003
Velvet Goldmine," Not very good
","A friend of mine loves this film, so when it came on the Bravo Network, I gave it a try.  It started out pretty good, when Brian Slade got shot and all, but as soon as they got involved with Ewan McGregor and all of that homosexual stuff, it just turned into a confusing, self-indulgent mish-mash. I expected a little more from Christian Bale too, he was really good in 'American Psycho', but here he is really dull, Is he really british, or is that his fake british accent?  Anyway, when it all comes down to it, this is a dissapointing and self-indulgent attempt to make a 'Citizen Kane' style glam rocker biography.  My rating ** out of ****, or 5/10.",5,1,10,23 September 2003
The Game," dumb, confusing, and overrated
","What a mess of a movie, the whole idea of Micheal Douglas being the subject of a game is a good idea, but it just doesnt seem to work.  It never really gives much suspense or excitement.  Micheal Douglas plays the same boring victim he has played in all of his other movies in the past 15 years(with the exeption of Falling Down '1993'.  Sean Penn should have only been billed as a special appearence because he is only in the movie for about 15 minutes at most.  Overall 'The Game' is a predictable and boring mess that I will never play again. 3 out of 10.",2,7,15,30 December 2002
Dumb and Dumber," The funniest movie ever made!!
","I own this movie, and I've probably watched it at least 500 times. This movie is a laugh a minute! No movie, not even Blazing Saddles is even close to being as funny as this. Most comedies i have seen start out very funny, but get very boring quickly. Not this one, this movie will keep you laughing from start to finish. If you like to laugh, you have to see this movie.",10,1,3,2 June 2002
Jerry Maguire," Overrated, self indulgent and offensive
","Man, why does everybody like this movie?  I thought it was terrible.  Tom Cruise was as irritating as ever, so was Cuba Gooding(who somehow managed to snag an oscar). Not only was it irritating, it was offensive, having to hear the f-word all of the time for no reason whatsoever, Tom Cruise having sex with Kelly Preston in several scenes, which would have been better if they didnt film them like a porno.  Self indulgent characters and annoying diologue destroy this one completely. *1/2 out of *****.",3,13,31,27 March 2003
The Big Blue," Weird, but worth seeing
","This is one strange movie, I think it could be placed in the Avant-Garde genre.  It consists of two freedivers and a ditzy girlfriend, well played by Roseanna Arquette.  The version I got was the directors cut which ran about 3 hours, and seemed a little too long, but it was still a watchable film, especially for the breathtaking underwater shots.  This film is often considered a turkey in the U.S., but it's really not bad at all, I think many critics expected too much.  Griffin Dunne, who starred in 'After Hours'(1985), with Arquette has a brief, almost useless cameo as her boss. This film is a difficult one to find, I had been looking for it for quite a while, and I was shocked to find it in the $3.00 bin at Wal-Mart.  A unique experience. ***1/2 out of *****.",7,4,8,20 June 2003
The Insider," What's the big deal people?, its average
","Knowing that this movie was nominated for several academy awards, I decided to check it, and I was not too impressed. First of all I cannot stand Russell Crowe, he seemed to just come out of nowhere in 1997, and everone raves about him. Al Pacino gives a good performance as always. The movie just doesnt have enough power and twists and turns to make it exciting for 3 hours, although it is the best I have seen the overated Micheal Mann do, I thought Heat was an even bigger bore!!. 5 out of 10",Null,0,1,3 November 2002
Mission: Impossible," Good special effects can't even make this piece of trash watchable
","Another Hollywoodized to the max, way over done spy thriller.  This one, as you all know is a remake of a popular 50's tv show.  Cheesy Tom Cruise hams his way through this movie, like he does in most of his other movies.  There are a few good scenes were the special effects are extraordinary, but they cannnot make this movie worthwhile.  Jean Reno irritates me, possibly because he has made so many other bad movies(Rollerball, The Professional, Ronin).  Ving Rhames is kinda cool in a very small role as another agent. Overall, just another boring, poorly acted attempt at a good movie.  Skip it, unless you are a huge action buff.  ** out of *****.",5,2,7,11 March 2003
The Fly," The film that made me love Cronenberg
","When I saw this movie I could not believe how excellent is was, it was so fascinating and scary at the same time.  Jeff Goldblum was perfect for that role, he kinda looks like a fly to begin with.  I have not scene the original, but im sure this is far better.  Nobody could have directed this movie like Cronenberg, his scenery and music add a lot to the film.  I have seen 3 other Cronenberg films: The Dead Zone(1983), Videodrome(1983), and eXistenZ(1999), and this is the best I have seen yet.  Any true sci-fi fan needs to see this film.",9,1,2,21 May 2003
Hoosiers," A wonderful, often underrated movie
","I saw this movie today, and I really was touched. Not only is it a great sports movie, it also deals with many of the characters personal problems. I always feel bad for Gene Hackman, because very few of his movies are appreciated, and this was one thatmany people have forgotton about. If you are a fan of Hackman, or like basketball, see this film. 9 out of 10",Null,1,1,10 November 2002
Titanic," OK, but still Cameron's worst movie
","This movie is not great, its just OK, especially considering that it won so many awards, and was directed by James Cameron, whose made several masterpieces(both Terminators, Aliens, and The Abyss), which were all much, much better than this.  This film had several flaws, overlength, sucky acting(Leonardo that's you) to name a few.  When I think of a James Cameron film, I think of heart-pounding thrills, and a little bit of blood to add a little extra interest.  It just annoys me how James Cameron is known for this movie, when his other movies were so much better, especaially the criminalally underrated 'The Abyss'.  This film is worth watching, but it is no where near a masterpiece.   *** out of *****.",Null,2,4,25 April 2003
The Godfather: Part III," Easier to follow than the first two, but has a few flaws
","I finally saw this the other day, and I did find it much easier to follow than the first two, but one problem with this movie was Coppola's choice to put his daughter(Sofia Coppola) in the film, she's not bad looking, but she had hardly any prior acting experience, and her bad acting took away from the films quality. Everything else about the movie is great. ***1/2 out of *****",Null,2,5,19 August 2002
When Harry Met Sally...," A little overrated
","I saw this film a few weeks ago, and I enjoyed it but I really dont think it deserves a 7.7 at all.  The acting is good and everything, but it tries too hard to be funny, for example: The deli scene.  The story is cute, and I could sort of relate to the characters, but it just didnt quite it the bulls-eye. I think it deserves maybe a 6.5 at most.",2,8,23,18 August 2002
The Mission," A long, difficult mess, with no payoff in the end
","Its sad, because I was really looking forward to this film, and at the end, I was highly dissapointed.  The story is plain and obvious, with the actors just acting it out.  There are several scenes where there is absolutely no diologue whatsoever, and the camera just pans along at the scenery.  I cannot recommend this film to anyone, its obviously an overlong mess, with little redeeming value.  *1/2 out of ****, or 3.6/10.",3,7,25,5 August 2003
Halloween," Actually the worst of the John Carpenter movies!!!
","I had put off this one for a long time due to its age, thinking it probly wouldnt be scary anymore, and I was right.   This is a  perfect of example of how age and hype can kill a movie.   Its so predictable because everyone is always talking about it, and what Michael Myers does, and its not suspenseful because you already know what will happen.  Frankly, I thought Carpenters movies like 'The Thing'(1982), and 'The Fog'(1980), were far more superior to, and scarier than this.  ** out of ****.",5,3,6,6 June 2003
Tombstone," My all time favorite western
","I have wanted to see this film for a very long time now, and now that I have, I love it.  Kurt Russell gives a great performance as Wyatt Earp, and so does the rest of the cast.  The old west scenery was superb, as well as the music.  I found it hard to believe that hack director Cosmatos popped out this masterpiece, he's usually know for crapp like 'Cobra', 'Rambo 2', and the sloppily done but enjoyable 'Leviathan', he got lucky on this one. Overall this is a must see for all western fans. 9.5 out of 10.",Null,0,0,11 March 2003
Heat," The most overrated movie ever made
","What a boring, overly long movie.  Nothing seems to come together in it. I dont know why I thought it was so boring, it's got a great cast. The problem is that stupid Michael Mann tried to spend 3 hours trying to tell a story that a good director could tell in an hour,he should have cut out all of the unneeded diologue to make it more to the point, without all of the trailing off into unneeded diologue. I dont understand why this movie is in the top 250, because it does not deserve to be up that high in the ratings. * out of *****",Null,1,4,23 November 2002
The Thin Red Line," What a yawner!!!
","It looked like this movie would be a masterpiece when it started, but after about 10 minutes I found myself checking the remainaining time on the VCR. This could have been a really great film, it had great scenery, and an extroardinary cast, including Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Cusack, John C. Reilly, and John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, and George Clooney in cameo appearences.  All of the diologue was extremely choppy, and the film was too long for the little that had to be said.  If you want to see a decent war film see Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, or Apocalypse Now.  *1/2 out of ****.",1,11,21,30 March 2003
Contact," Typical Hollywood Claptrap
","I did not find this to be a very memorable film.  I dont remember this film real well because it was a few months ago that I watched it, but it was pretty dull, a lot of people just sitting around discussing if its a good idea or not and how the american people would react to it, it became much more of just a political drama.  The thing that made me the most angry about this film was that it was supposed to be a sci-fi, and it really isnt, not much special effects, no making actual visual contact with another lifeforce, just a lot of talk.  It also bugged me that people liked this film due to 'Jodie Foster's performance', thats just plain stupid, Im sorry to offend anyone, but you dont see a sci-fi just for performances, she wasnt very good in this anyway in my opinion.  Who is this James Berdenilli dude, he gave this movie **** out of ****, I think he might need to have his head examined, as well as Roger Ebert.  ** out of *****.",Null,1,3,8 May 2003
Born on the Fourth of July," An underappriciated and underrated Oliver Stone classic
","This movie could be the most powerful movie ever made, quite possibly Stone's best. It didn't get the same critical praise as Stone's other Vietnam movie 'Platoon'(1986), but it should have ,because it's much more interesting and deals much more with it's characters. Tom Cruise gives his best performance in this as well. This is the only movie that I ever thought he did an excellent acting job in. It has a great cast too that includes:Raymond J. Barry(Falling Down), several cameo appearances: Tom Berenger (Platoon), William Dafoe(Platoon), William Baldwin(Flatliners), John Getz(The Fly, Blood Simple), and Mike Starr(Frenchy from Goodfellas, Mental from Dumb and Dumber). Overall a great film. 10 out of 10",Null,0,2,18 November 2002
High Fidelity," Self indulged nonsense
","This has got to be one of the most annoying movies ive seen.  It deals with a whining John Cusack complaining about all of his past relationships with girls and how they didnt work, who really cares, for those of us who cant even find relationships this movie is terrible.  This movie made me dislike John Cusack, who I liked in Grosse Pointe Blank, and Being John Malkavich. I guess the problem is that I cant really relate to his problems, and if you cant there is really nothing for you in this movie.  One redeeming factor was the few scenes Jack Black was in, he was kind of funny.  Overall this movie really stunk.  2 out of 10.",5,4,10,24 May 2003
From Here to Eternity," Finally, a classic that lives up to expectations!!!
","I can't believe how excellent this was, I almost never enjoy older films, but this was fantastic.  You really can get into the story, and feel what the characters are feeling.  I think it helped to see many of the older actors we know today when they were younger, look for Jack Warden(While You Were Sleeping), Ernest Borgnine(Escape From New York, Gattaca) in small, but important roles.
