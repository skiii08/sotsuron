Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Pathetic! Horrible! Mindless!
","When I saw the relatively high rating for 'Borat' on IMDb, I thought maybe, just maybe, it would be more clever and sophisticated than the TV ads and movie trailers suggested. I plunked down my $1.75 for the 'Bargain Tuesday' admission, walked in, and sat down in my usual row-6 seat with high expectations that my fellow-IMDBers would not let me down.I was wrong - horribly wrong! As many others have explained with more wit than I can muster, 'Borat' is a disgrace to the film-making profession. One juvenile toilet/sex joke after another. Pathetic and offensive. I may have laughed once.As far as the high IMDb rating, I presume that most members with good taste simply avoided this 'film' (and I'm not sure that's the appropriate description for this thing), based on the ads. Most of those who have given it a 10 must be a pre-selected audience of Sasha Baron Cohen fans.Still, we all have the right to enjoy whatever films we like, and I'll concede that there's a market and an audience for both 'Borat' and 'Gone with the Wind'.At least my evening wasn't a total waste. The second feature was 'Stranger Than Fiction', which was infinitely more enjoyable, and highly recommended to those of you who, like me, gave 'Borat' a 1.",1,23,46,24 January 2007
