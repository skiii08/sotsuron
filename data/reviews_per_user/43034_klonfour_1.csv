National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Car Chases - Fun for kids - Spoof!
","Kids will enjoy this movie and that's just fine. But, why does there have to be a car chase in every action movie set in contemporary times? They all seem alike to me. But then, all football games look alike to me, too! Glad to see children will recognize a few famous places after viewing movie. But wish directors kept geography accurate - should not have put lake by Mt. Rushmore. Didn't like totally misleading history with Mayan-like symbols as clues to location of gold in South Dakota, of all places! Adults will enjoy these few hours of light entertainment more if they consider the movie a spoof of first National Treasure ( and that might even be considered by some as a spoof of all treasure hunting movies). Acting by Jon Voight, Helen Mirren, and Ed Harris kept it from going over the top with that format.",6,1,1,26 December 2007
