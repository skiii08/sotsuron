Requiem for a Dream," Watch this film
","Oh My God, i watched this film last night and haven't been able to stop thinking about it all day, it emotionally crippled me i couldn't sleep last night, the thought of that last emotionally charged roller-coaster of a scene just kept me awake, Now don't get me wrong - I'm a media student and I've seen some pretty scary stuff in films before but i don't think anything could have hardened me towards what i saw in this film.this is in my opinion, one of the saddest and harrowing films i have ever watched. i need to watch it again, I'm just not sure when i will pluck up the courage. I must admit, the cutaways were a bit annoying to me at the start, but i soon got used to them and i understand why they were used., but the story and the characters were both tragically perfect, Not for many years has a film had this kind of suffocating effect on me, i will not forget this film in a hurry. if this film doesn't stop kids taking drugs nothing will, Show it to all 6 formers i say this is more of a lesson that most will learn in the classroom!",10,1,2,12 May 2006
Edward Scissorhands," Beautiful
","To me this film is one of the most beautiful and touching films i have ever seen,it is one of the ,if not THE best film to be directed by Tim Burton, and the acting from Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder is brilliant. This film is so sweet and lovely it always makes me cry, there's a gorgeous child like innocence, which makes the film so special. I think Johnny Depp deserves all the credit he can get for this performance, the childlike subtle beauty of Edward is a pleasure to watch. Vincent Price does a great job of being the old inventor up in his mansion at the top of the hill - definitely a perfect film to end his career.This film deserves 11 out of 10, to me this is the perfect film, and id definitely say its my favourite.",10,0,1,8 June 2006
Slumdog Millionaire," 'Jai Ho' !!!!!
","Danny Boyle is easily up there with my favourite directors,he seems to catch real emotion and beauty in such everyday things, this film is beautifully shot and acted, it really is such a beautiful film. I really loved the format the idea of the film being set around who wants to be millionaire and with all the terrible things that had happened to the main characters being the reason they eventually broke free,it is so bittersweet at the end, the final scenes are so gripping, Also i loved the fact that it was so true to life,the characters, situations, settings, all real India! Watch this film - also really loved the dancing at the end !! Fab !! 'it rocks' !!!!",10,4,11,9 May 2009
