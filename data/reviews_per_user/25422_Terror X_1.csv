The Blair Witch Project," Freaky movie, read this if you are taking the bad reviews seriously this could be a spoiler.
","Those that are not scared by this movie do so because they miss the point, are only scared by gore, they do not fear death because they think they are invincible, and/or they do not have the ability to remove themselves from their seats in the theaters and place themselves in the charactor's role.It is NOT: The movie is not a Big Hollywood Production with all the bells and whistles that todays horror flicks have in common.  It is not meant to be known whether this is fictional or not.  It is not shot on a sound stage.  It is not accompanied by a full orchestra to entertain you through the slow moments.  It does not have a unbelievable plot.  There is not any supernatural effects in this movie.It IS: It is meant to be seen as a true event.  There are 3 film collage students out to make a documentary film.  Being film students they are over zealous and tape everything.  They more likely tape things zealously to extenuate their situation.  The movie is supose to be a timeline compliation of the film and camra work done by the missing students.  If you have ever gone camping and heard noises which you could not identify then you can relate easily to the reactions the students have.  Their terror is a acurate portrayal of common fears and justly so.  The movie is very realistic.  It is this realism that makes this movie chilling.I do not scare easily but the next time I go camping I hope I do not remember this film.Happy Movie Going.",6,2,5,3 August 1999
