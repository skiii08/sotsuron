10 Cloverfield Lane," One of the Best Thrillers of 2016
","10 Cloverfield Lane is one of the best thrillers of 2016 so far. One note I would like to say is that this is not a sequel to the original Cloverfield. The film could take place in the same universe in Cloverfield but this is not a sequel. Also if your suspecting the Cloverfield monster to be in this film, your going to be disappointed. This film is a drama, and tense film with some horror elements in it. The acting in the film is great but the one person that stood out the most was John Goodman. He is one of the most underrated actors working in Hollywood today. I believe John Goodman is Oscar-worthy for his performance. This is Dan Trachtenberg's first film he has ever directed and I can't wait to see what he brings in the future. The film also does have an amazing score from Bear McCreary. One other thing a really liked about this film is the sound. The only negative I can say about this film is the ending. The ending felt rushed. The mystery in the film keeps you hooked until the very end and then near the end it felt okay but, this is a film that needs to be viewed a second time. Overall if your a fan of thrillers or very tense films then this is for you. And if they plan on making an anthology with this movie then I'm excited to see what they do next.",9,5,9,25 March 2016
12 Angry Men," Classic Film
","*Story: Based on the play. 12 men of the jury are deciding if a 18 year old boy is guilty or not guilty for killing his father. 11 men decided that the boy is guilty but one man said he's not guilty. So this single juror tries to prove to the other 11 jurors why the boy is not guilty. The movie then turns into a huge argument between the jurors to put this case to rest.*Review: 12 Angry Men is one of the best dramas ever made period. And this movie is right up there in my favorite movies of all time. What's really good about this movie is that it all takes place in one room and that's the jury room. The dialogue between the jurors is just phenomenal because you just don't know what the next person is going to say. Also each character is different their not the same which is great. During the film you get to learn about the case and try to piece it all together. This movie is amazing. Everything about this movie is perfect from the acting, writing, and plot. Overall if you love dramas or courtroom dramas then this is your movie.'Prejudice always obscures the truth.' -Juror #8",10,0,1,6 July 2014
American Sniper," Bradley Cooper Gives One Of The Best Performances Of His Career.
",American sniper is probably one of the best war films I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. Now I would probably won't consider this a war film because it mostly focuses on one character. One of the most recent war films that I really enjoyed last year was Lone Survivor. Now I thought that movie was really good but it was just handle very overly dramatic. I think this is probably one of the best performances Bradley Cooper has given in his career. I also think this is Clint Eastwood's best movie he has directed since Gran Torino. The action scenes were handled very well and it felt real. One problem I had with the film were the supporting characters. Now the acting for them were good but it's just you never get to know most of them their just there for the main character. The story is mostly just learning about one character. There really isn't that much to say about this film but if your a fan of war films then I would highly recommend checking this film out.,9,325,599,17 January 2015
Nightcrawler," One Of My Favorite Films Of 2014 So Far.
",Nightcrawler is one of my favorite films of 2014 so far this year. Gyllenhaal is starting to become one of my favorite actors. He has changed his whole career around by playing more serious roles and different roles. This is probably one of the best movies he has acted in. Gyllenhaal's character is kind of like Patrick Bateman from American Psycho he's just creepy and scary. The story of Nightcrawler is very interesting and different. The film looks beautiful especially when scenes are taken place at night. There are some really cool shots in the film that have a point of view in the car. Now this film is not for everyone some people will like this movie and some won't like it. There's going to be people that will root for Gyllenhaal and some just want to see his character dead. The acting is fantastic but I think the most important character from this movie is Gyllenhaal because the movie just focuses on him. I really think Gyllenhaal will get a nomination for an Academy Award and I won't be surprised if he won. The screenplay of this movie is also fantastic and I think it will get a nomination for that. There are some very intense moments in the movie especially in the last 30 minutes. Nightcrawler is one of my favorite movies of 2014 and I hope everyone has a chance to see this movie.,10,3,7,5 November 2014
Collateral," Fantastic Performances From Tom Cruise And Jamie Foxx
","*Story: A cab driver name Max Durocher has been driving a cab for nearly 12 years and he's trying to save money to make his own limousine service. One night Max picks up a man named Vincent. Vincent ask Max to stop at 5 locations where Vincent plans to kill 5 men. The film then turns into a hostage situation between a cab driver and a contract killer.*Review: I think this is one movie that needs more attention because it seems that a lot of people have just ignored the movie. This movie is so close to being one of the best thrillers that I have ever seen so far. Everything about this movie is great like the acting, directing, story, writing, and the dialogue between these men. One thing that I did not like about this movie is the ending. The ending just didn't feel right because there were some holes that needed to filled and your just begging for more. This movie made a turning point in Tom Cruises career which made him a great actor. Also this proved that Jamie Foxx can play any role you give him. Overall if you like films that are thrillers or if you want a film that feels like a film noir then this is your movie.' You attract attention, you're going to get people killed who didn't need to be.' - Vincent",8,3,4,5 July 2014
It Follows," The Creepiest Film I've Seen In A Long Time
",It Follows is probably one of the most creepiest movie I've seen in a long time. The movie is not all that scary as people say but it is very creepy. There are only two jump scares in the film which is something different because today most horror films have a ton of jump scares. The film is just very creepy. The acting in this film is very good but Maika Monroe steals the entire film with her acting and I believe she will be the next scream queen in horror films. Her character reminds me of Jamie Lee Curtis character from Halloween. It Follows does remind me of Halloween a little bit. The story of this film just feels new and different. Some people might like the story but some people might not like it. I really enjoyed the story because it kept me hooked and it was very interesting. Also how this film was shot looked amazing. The score for this film was totally awesome because it had an 80's feel to it. And the score kept tension and it was very creepy. I would highly recommend checking this film out if your a fan of horror films or if your interested to check out something new.,9,78,155,10 April 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," All Hail Caesar!
",*Story: A substance that helps a person with Alzheimer's is given to an chimp for testing. The chimps name is Bright Eyes. After Bright Eyes escapes from its cage it gets shot. Then a scientist discovers that the mother had a baby chimp and was trying to protect it. A scientist named Rodman who works for Gen-Sys decides to take care of the baby chimp at his own home. He named this chimp Caesar. As the years past the chimp gets older and when the chimp gets older it becomes smarter. This intelligent chimp leads to an ape uprising that could change the world as we know it.*Review: I'm glad that 20th Century Fox decided to reboot the Planet of the Ape series because that remake of Planet of the Apes was just a huge disappointment. But this movie is actually an origin story for the franchise. Andy Serkis is just perfect for this movie and this is probably one of his best motion capture acting ever. In this movie they do make some references to the 1968 film Planet of the Apes which is really awesome and it actually works. One word to describe the visual effects.... 'Amazing.' The apes look so real. The story is interesting and the acting is really good too. The story gets better when Caesar gets older. One complaint that I have is that I wanted this movie to be just a little bit longer. This is probably one of the best Planet of the Apes films since the original 1968 version. Overall this a movie everyone should see this movie even if your a fan of this franchise. And I think the sequel is going to be even better.'Caesar is home.' -Caesar,8,2,3,10 July 2014
Gone Girl," One of My Favorite David Fincher Films Ever Made
",Gone Girl is probably one of my favorite David Fincher films he has directed. The story for Gone Girl is amazing even though it's slow in the beginning but it gets even better during the 2nd act. The story keeps you hooked until the very end. And the story gets crazy and crazier as the story goes on. The acting is very good everyone did great. This is probably one of the best performances Ben Affleck gave and I think Rosamund Pike deserves to be nominated for an award for her performance. Also Tyler Perry gave a good performance too which really surprised me. This movie is based on a novel which I read and the story follows really close to the movie. One thing that they should've changed was the ending. Now I liked the ending but I wished that the filmmakers changed it up a little bit like a 'I didn't see that coming' moment. If your a fan of David Fincher films check this movie out. If your into mysteries I highly recommend checking this film out you won't be disappointed.,9,1,11,4 October 2014
Schindler's List," All I Can Say 'Masterpiece'
","*Story: Schindler is a German businessman and when the Holocaust starts to begin he decides to have Jews come work for him which will help them stay out of the concentration camps. As long as the Jews stay out of those camps Schindler makes money.*Review: Schindler's List is probably one of the best movies that I have ever seen and ever made. What's really good about this movie is the acting. Liam Neeson proves that he can act and he should have won a Oscar for his performance as Oskar Schindler. Ralph Fiennes also gives a great performance and should have won a Oscar for his performance as Amon Goeth but since the academy doesn't give awards to actors that play as bad people is dumb. What I really liked about this movie is how the whole movie is shot in black and white it just makes the movie even better. While your watching this movie you feel really emotional inside. Everything about this movie is just perfect from the acting, cinematography, musical score, writing, and directing. This movie is intense, emotional, and apiece of art. In one word I can describe this movie 'MASTERPIECE'. This is probably one of Spielberg's best movies he has directed. Schindler's List is a movie that everyone should see once in their life.'This list... is an absolute good. The list is life. All around its margins lies the gulf'. - Itzhak Stern",10,36,61,2 July 2014
Dog Day Afternoon," One Of Al Pacinos Best Movies
","Story: Based on a true story. Two men attempt to rob a bank that turns into a hostage situation.Review: Now in my opinion I think this movie started Al Pacino's career as a movie actor. What I love about this movie is how the film has a lot comedy in it and there's a great twist in the story. The acting is terrific. Pacino and Cazale have great chemistry working together. Also the film seems like it's making fun of how the media acts. The story is also very intense because you never know what's going to happen to the robbers or hostages. I think this is probably one of the best movies that was made in the 70's. Everything in this movie is perfect from the acting, story, and the dialogue between Pacino and the cops which is very good. If your a fan of Pacino or heist genre then this is your movie.'ATTICA ATTICA!' -Sonny",10,0,1,4 July 2014
Sicario," 'One Of The Best Films Of 2015 So Far'
",Sicario is so far one of my favorite movies of 2015 so far. The acting in this film is outstanding. This is probably one of my favorite performance from Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin is also really good in the film too. The one performance that really sticked out the most was Benicio del Toro. His character was just scary and a bad-ass. I really do think Benicio del Toro is Oscar-worthy. Same thing goes for the score and cinematography. Also the directing from Denis Villeneuve is also Oscar worthy and it's one of the best directed films so far this year. Villeneuve is starting to become one of my favorite directors in Hollywood. The story is very tense and in the end you'll feel disgusted and shocked. Overall if your a fan of thrillers or very intense story telling then this is the film for you.,9,2,7,24 October 2015
The Witch," The Best Horror Film of 2016
",The Witch is one of the best horror films of 2016. This is a film that you'll either love it or hate it. I'm one of those people that loved this film. The film is creepy but not really scary. What's creepy about this film is the atmosphere and the musical score. What was scary about the film was the haunting imagery. The acting for the film is phenomenal everyone does a great job. When I was watching this film it felt like I was in the 1600's. Whoever did the set designs and the costumes all deserve an Oscar nomination. The directing for this film by Robert Eggers did a fantastic job for his directorial debut and I can't wait to see what he does next. There were a couple problems that I had with the film but they're only minor ones. The pacing of the film does have a couple slow parts and the language that the characters speak is hard to understand but later on in the film you start to have a better understanding of what they are saying. A lot of people didn't like the ending but I thought it was a good ending and I will be remembering that last shot for awhile. Overall if you're a fan of these art house horror films then this is for you. I think this is a film that will be analyzed in film schools and will come down to a horror classic.,9,5,10,21 February 2016
Deadpool," One Of The Best Superhero Films Since The Dark Knight Rises
","Deadpool is one of the best films so far of 2016 and one of the best superhero films since The Dark Knight Rises. The marketing for this film is some of the best but I was worried that the film wouldn't live up to the hype. So I went into this film with low expectations. When I came out of the film I LOVED this movie. Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool and he gave one of his best performances of his career. The film is directed very well from first time director Tim Miller. I honestly thought there would be shaky camera action but I was wrong. The action is quick, fast, and very brutal. One of the best things for this movie is the writing. The movie is very funny and it's one of the best comedies that came out in recent year. I do agree with the film being R rated because it fits with the character and if this film was PG-13 it wouldn't be good and the film would hardly have a story to tell and I do hope they start to make more superhero films R rated. Overall if your a fan of Deadpool this movie is for you and even if your not a fan of him or superhero films this is still a great movie to check out.",10,3,11,21 February 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Max Fury Road Is A Action Masterpiece
","Mad Max Fury Road is one of the best action films I've seen in a long, long time. George Miller is back with Mad Max after Beyond The Thunder Dome which was 30 years ago. Directors who usually return to a franchise who started it don't end up really good. Some examples are George Lucas for Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Or Steven Spielberg for Indiana Jones 4. But George Miller proves that he can bring a franchise back to life. This is probably one of the best action films of the summer so far. Tom Hardy as Max did a fine job but Charlize Theron as Furiosa is amazing. Her character kicked some major ass. The story was also great and it was very simple. It's just getting from point A to point B. The action was amazing and there wasn't any of that shaky cam. George Miller's direction is amazing because he uses some wide shots which looks amazing. The movie is also very intense I also felt hot while I was watching this movie because it takes place in a desert like area. I really loved how much of the action was done practical because today action films do CGI for tough shots but in this film it was all done with practical effects which made it feel real. This film isn't for everyone. The film is very weird and crazy which most people can't take. If your a Mad Max fan you'll enjoy the hell out of this film. Mad Max Fury Road is one of the best films this summer and one of my favorite films this year. I really hope we get to see more Mad Max films in the next couple years because this film deserves all the money it needs and sequels it needs. I would say that Mad Max Fury Road is considered a action masterpiece.",10,5,16,17 May 2015
