Skyfall," Shockingly Bad Movie (regardless of 'Bond' theme)
","If you have read the first review by Vijay Dinanath, then you can pretty much skip my comments, as he said everything that needed to be said on this rather dull movie. My comments would be;Script: Poor, felt like a student movie. Thats all the value I would put on it, its 'that' bad.Plot: Missing. Poor quality one-liners, nothing to keep you interested. Plot by numbers as you could pretty much figure out what was going to happen scene to scene, and be right 100% of the timeFemme Fatale Bond 'is' sexy women, but in Skyfall, you get a scene that suggests popping up behind a women (so to speak...) in the shower is okay, as long as you've spoken to her for at least 90 seconds that day. Hell she was even 'terrified' of her boss, so does Bond now take advantage of women suffering domestic violence?. The lack of gorgeous women in a Bond file is criminal, the shower scene even more so.Gadgets None. Yes, none, and the only one he is given he losses in the first 5 minutes. So to repeat, a Bond film, with not 'one' single gadget. Movie as a whole. Dull, predictable, no gloss, zero humor and I mean 'zero', not ONE cheeky or witty line through the entire movie. The car is introduced at the end of the film, pretty much. Was this some conscious plan, to say 'we do not need a Bond car, we can DO Bond without it'.I guess nobody tries to make a bad movie, but somebody somewhere should have stopped Mendes in his tracks and reminded, no instructed him that his vision was not a Bond fans vision, and I'm not even a Bond fan per say.Movie, as a whole 4/10. Trust me when you see it, you will wonder where these reviews come from that state such tosh as 'moving scenes' and 'thrilling special effects'.",Null,16,29,12 January 2013
