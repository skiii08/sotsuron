Mission: Impossible III," Smart, tense, and dark
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Out of the three Mission Impossible movies I have seen, MI 3 is the best. It combines the intelligent, investigation aspect of the first film, but tosses in a little action for good measure. In a way it combines the best aspects of the first two movies. From MI 1 it gets the tension, and the break in scenes, as well as an intelligent plot, where you don't know who to trust, and we get some big reveals at the end. From the second movie, we get the action scenes (though much more toned down and believable) and we get an actual villain (though much better). This one also didn't feel like a Tom Cruise ego trip (yes, MI 2, I'm looking at you). Tom Cruise gives a much better performance in this one, as Ethan Hunt gets a bit more character, instead of just... agent. He had some personality in the first one, not much, but some, but by the second one, he was an awkward blend of James Bond and Neo. The romance scenes are a little cheesy, but I thought they were used well, as Hunt's romance is a major plot point. Cruise has much better chemistry with the new love interest than he did with Nyah from the second movie. Phillip Seymour Hoffman really delivers as the villain. While Sean from MI 2 served as like an evil version of Hunt, Hoffman's Davien is like the complete opposite of Hunt. Davien is ruthless, cold, uncaring, and cruel. You can tell he takes pleasure in what he does, even though he hides it under his calm demeanor. Hoffman really helped make this movie. Another person who deserves the credit for this movie is J.J. Abrams, one of my favorite directors. He really knows how to make a good tone for a movie, and he handles characters really well. This movie is no exception, Abrams is easily the best MI director so far. Brian De Palma shot the first one in such a weird way it looked like it was made in the 60's. And John Woo abused slo-mo something awful in the second movie. It's also nice seeing a moderate level of action, unlike the second movie which was just overloaded with action. The action sequences are also well handled, even though they do feel a bit choppy at times. In conclusion, I think Mission: Impossible III was a good movie, with a great villain, a good story, and some good action. Now, I think I'm finally on board with the Mission: Impossible movies.",7,1,1,15 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great action and effects make up for the weak links in the acting
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* I've always thought that The Phantom Menace has been unfairly judged. The Phantom Menace had so much hype and nostalgia that had been built up from the first three movies, that nothing short of perfection could've lived up to it. Is this is a perfect movie? Definitely not. Is this a great movie? No, not really. Is this a fun movie? Yes. A lot of people have problems with the political side to the story in the Star Wars prequels, but I thought that was a good addition, it added a bit to the complexity of the Star Wars universe, making it much less simplistic. Now, I'm not saying the politics couldn't have been handled better, but Lucas certainly had the right idea. The Phantom Menace also gets a lot of heat for being too boring, which I can understand. Parts of this movie drag, but as I've said I do like the political side of Star Wars, so I'm not bothered by having a slower, less action-packed Star Wars movie. Okay, now let's get down to the really tough part: the cast. We all know about Jar- Jar Binks, and no I don't like him, but I will say that as a kid I loved Jar-Jar, so once again, Lucas did succeed partially. He made a character kids would like, he just needed to tone him down a bit and make him a little less... well, y'know. Jake Lloyd gets a lot of grief, but I think he believably portrayed an eight year old, it's the just the fact that Anakin is a kid that really bothers people from what I've gathered. I do think Ewan McGragor and Liam Neeson delivered solid performances and like able characters in this movie. They may not be as good as Han Solo, but their characters had enough subtle personality and characterization to make them interesting. Obviously, the action is the obvious point to bring up when listing positives for the prequels, and I agree. The action is top-notch, and very visually pleasing. I love the effects too, the CGI gives everything a sleek look to it, and the ships look much less clunky than they did in the original trilogy. But those aren't the only things I like about Episode One, the story is a little cluttered, but I think it is a good story. I will admit that Phantom Menace doesn't hold up on its own, you do kind of need the whole saga to really enjoy it, but it's still not as bad as people would have you believe. I also like the characters, though they are a bit bland. I'm not saying I can't understand some of the complaints, what I am saying is that the amount of hate against this movie is ridiculous and unfair, this isn't a bad movie. There I said it.",7,3,5,11 June 2015
Iron Man 3," Lazy writing; a big disappointment
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* I'm going to be honest, I am not the biggest MCU fan. I really like the movies in Phase one, I even like Iron Man 2 and the Incredible Hulk. Phase two... meh. That being the case, I was already on the side of Iron Man movies when I saw this, and am a big superhero movie fan, so for this movie to lose me as much as it did... that's a true feat. This time though, being a fan of the comics actually makes you like the movie less. Even though I hated this movie the first time I saw it, I have grown to enjoy it a little bit. That being said, I still consider this movie to be sub-par. Why? Well, here are just a few reasons. The Mandarin. Yes, this is what I meant by saying if you like the comics, you won't like this movie. The Mandarin is not a menacing super villain armed with alien technology, he's not a warlord, he is not in anyway THE Iron Man villain, in fact... he's not even a villain. The Mandarin is a figure head used by the real villain (more on him in a bit) to draw the attention of the U.S., and not only that, but they took the twist one step farther and turned him into a punch line; he's nothing more than a drunk actor masquerading as a terrorist. And that... no, just no. Look, I understand the comics have to be adapted, I get that, I understand even very popular characters might not be suited for the big screen, I get that too, but the one thing you shouldn't do is disrespect the source material. Taking a few jokes at the dumber moments from the comics is alright (even the actual comic books do that), but this isn't a poke at the comics, this is a slap in the face to the fans, and this instantly put me firmly on the side of against Iron Man 3. This could've been a good twist if they'd used like a c-list villain, but the #1 Iron Man villain? No, that just doesn't work. Another big problem I have with this movie is the massive changes to Tony Stark. I didn't like them. I like seeing Tony looking like he's in trouble, but it should actually be the villain of the movie who breaks him, not just the villain from Avengers. We should see Aldrich Killian (or preferably; The Mandarin) break Tony, push him to his breaking point, and see Tony come back, rise up, and defeat his enemy. A bit like TDKR, but that wouldn't be the only thing they copied from The Dark Knight Rises. Seeing Tony having panic attacks and anxiety issues over the mere mention of the events in The Avengers is a little too much though, and the real villain, Aldrich Killian, is a disposable bad guy for Tony to struggle with for two hours, he's not an arch-nemesis, he's not anything important to Tony, he's just another villain to kill off. Not exactly the way your trilogy you should go out. Another problem I had was all the plot holes, but I try to overlook plot holes whenever possible, because, I'm more interested in the story and characters than every little detail. Still, Tony not bringing out his suits earlier in the movie is a glaring issue that I have a hard time ignoring. Problem #5: the mechanized suits. I know this is in the comics, but having Tony pilot his suits by remote control, and making an army of suits that are easily disposable? I'm pretty sure this movie confirmed at least three of the Five Nightmares from that epic story line (c'mon, you know you wanna see Ezekiel Stane! A villain who could rival RDJ for screen presence? Oh yeah!). Also, it makes Tony not feel particularly special. He just builds the suits, why not just let someone else hold the remote? I have one last problem with this movie and with most of the Phase two movies in general. Joke overload. Seriously, there are too many jokes in this movie, and they are very ill-timed. I don't mind alleviating some tension with a bit of humor, but this movie just straight up has no tension, and that makes me lose interest pretty quickly to be honest. However, I still find Iron Man 3 to be very enjoyable, in a mindless kind of way. Once you realize it isn't very good, it's actually a pretty easy movie to have fun with. It's not like Batman & Robin bad, it's just not very good. In the end, Iron Man 3 is a sub par movie, with good action, good effects, lazy writing, a weak story, and a bad tone.",5,1,3,29 June 2015
Star Trek Into Darkness," Great cast and effects make up for plot holes
","*WARNING CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS* So after the first Star Trek movie which I really loved, there was a very long wait, and then finally, in 2013, after four whole years between movies, Star Trek Into Darkness came out, and, I was not one bit disappointed. That's not to say it's the equal of J.J. Abrams's original master piece, which showed the entire crew coming together and their first meetings and the start of the friendship between Kirk and Spock, but this does give us something else. A great villain. Benedict Cumberbatch plays that villain, and that villain is: Khan. And to be 100% honest, Cumberbatch has to be one of the best Star Trek villains of all time, he was just a very menacing and very memorable villain. Watching him just wipe out about twenty Klingon warrior single-handedly was a very entertaining action scene, and what makes it even better is that Khan just surrenders to Kirk, and then Kirk just starts wailing away on him, to which Khan stands there placidly, while Kirk keeps hitting him. That was a great scene. It's hard to get more menacing than just showing that the hero can do nothing to hurt you. I also like the parallels between Kirk and Khan, which was a nice touch. Of course the old cast is back, and they're all great. I liked the new dynamic between Kirk and Spock, where, you can tell they're friends, but they both have such different viewpoints, that there is a lot of conflict, and while Kirk is in control of a ship and more responsible, he's still the same guy as in the first one. I also liked that despite all the time they spent telling us how irresponsible Kirk is that by the end of the film, he finally comes to accept his responsibility as Captain, and is willing to sacrifice himself to save the ship. Bones isn't as good in this one, he barely has anything to do, but Karl Urban was still good. Carol Marcus is a nice addition to the cast, as is her father, Admiral Marcus, who makes for a good villain as well. I also think the tone of this movie was really great, it's dark, and you can tell things are dangerous for our heroes, but it's still a fun ride, it's not just all gloom and doom. The terrorist stories they've introduced in the more recent Star Trek stories is a good touch, since Star Trek's whole thing is dealing with current social issues. However, there were some things that were not good, and one of those is the pacing. I'm not sure if that's the right term, but this was a glaring issue later in the film. Okay, so first of all, Scotty disables the Vengeance, and Admiral Marcus sends security to deal with him , Kirk and Khan. Those guys get wiped out in like five seconds, and then... in the entire time it takes the heroes to reach the bridge, Marcus and his crew are still just sitting there, doing nothing. Or, later in the film, when Spock damages the Vengeance and Khan is going down with it, there's like ten minutes with the crew trying to save the Enterprise, and then, we finally get back to Khan and the Vengeance. It's like they just forgot about him, and then just shoved him in there to set up for the finale. And then there are the plot-holes. You can beam someone down to Earth, but you can't beam someone back up? Huh? Or, why Can't Bones just use one of the other Augment's blood to save Jim, does it have to be Khan? There are also numerous shout-outs to Wrath of Khan, some work, others feel too goofy. Kirk's sacrifice, that works, Spock yelling, 'KHAAAAAN!', that felt pretty silly. Still, they were a nice touch, and I thought this film was a worthy successor to the original Star Trek, and I'm looking forward to where these movies go next.",8,1,4,20 July 2015
Batman Returns," A great cast, but the direction and story telling leave much to be desired
","*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS* Batman Returns, for me, is a movie of sharp contrast. Some aspects of the film I love, while others I think are just plain bad. Before I get into the negatives and positives, let me just say that I still enjoy Batman Returns quite a bit, and I think for the first hour and fifteen minutes, it was a worthy successor to the original Batman movie in 1989. So, the negatives. Tim Burton's directing here is not good. I understand he likes doing weird stuff, and that was prevalent in the original Batman movie more or less. This one... goes a little too crazy. I like the dark and ominous tone this movie sets up, but unfortunately at times it just throws that out the window to have a scene that's just like... what? At one point in the movie Penguin puts a little control device on the Batmobile that allows him to control it, instead of Batman. Penguin controls it by driving a recreation of the bat-mobile, that looks like it's a kid's ride at a carnival. And throughout the scene Penguin has a TV screen that he uses to taunt Batman with, while making some truly horrible jokes. Yeah, it gets that crazy. And another thing, does anyone else notice just how many stretches there are where a central character disappears completely. Batman's in maybe thirty to forty minutes of the movie (okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but c'mon! It's called Batman Returns, not Batman shows up in a few scenes here and there). Catwoman disappears for a good twenty minutes towards the end of the film, and then just shows up at the end without any explanation. It's just...bizarre. Too many scenes that seem as though they're supposed to be taken seriously just come off as laughable, such as Penguin shooting his rebellious henchman who just stands there stupidly, or the police officers who open fire on the Penguin on sight, y'know, the former mayoral candidate. Then there's the cast, and this is where the movie really shines. Christopher Walken is delightfully over the top as Max Shreck, and is a joy to watch throughout the film, as he tosses lots of great dialogue around. 'Next time I'll push her out a higher window!' he remarks, after discovering Selena Kyle is still alive. Michael Keaton is still a great, if underused Batman, and then there's Michelle Pfeiffer of course, who is just a great Catwoman. Her and Keaton had some great chemistry together in this movie, and the scenes between them were easily the best things in the movie. Michael Gough is great as the dignified Alfred, and he and Keaton share some good scenes. And then... there's Danny Devito as the Penguin, who I just... I don't know why, but I just did not like him. He was kind of funny for a while, and even managed to be fairly sympathetic, but later on he just got too goofy, and he really doesn't do all that much, despite being featured so strongly. He was basically just a figure head for Shreck. Later on he hatches his own schemes, but the fact that he straps rockets to the backs of hundreds of penguins and sends them out controlled by radio waves to destroy Gotham doesn't help his case much. There are some good action scenes though, such as the fights between Batman and Catwoman, not to mention the numerous times the circus gang shows up and Batman has to fight them, such as the acrobats who he gets into some pretty fun martial arts duels with. On a side note, Batman killing people is something that kind of irks me, and I kind of like. Change is good, and I like that there's some difference to this than the Nolan movies in regards to themes, but seeing Batman killing people is just...weird. In the end, I really liked the first chunk of this movie, and absolutely loved Keaton, Pfeiffer, and Walken in their roles, but I really didn't like the end, the directing, or Devito. However, it was still entertaining, so I would recommend watching this movie if you haven't already.",7,0,0,10 July 2015
Terminator Salvation," A weak installment in a great franchise
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Terminator Salvation has a pretty bad reputation, but I'm a Terminator fan, so I absolutely had to watch it. Well... it's not all bad. I am not against shaking up the formula; eliminating the chase format the first three had all had was a bold move. That's not to say it was necessarily a bad choice, it could've worked, it just... didn't. I did like the decision to show us some of the war with the machines, but unfortunately the war we are shown here is like five years after the start. Seeing John Connor organize a resistance would've been a lot of fun, but instead we just get some generic war stories that involve John Connor (y'know, the leader of the resistance) having to commit mutiny to save his father and subordinate, Kyle Reese. This movie has absolutely none of the fun of the originals, I know Terminator 3 gets heat for tossing in too much comic relief, but at least it didn't take the whole thing so dead seriously. There's no humor to liven up the proceedings, and what's worse, there's no heart or soul to this movie. The whole thing is just so bleak and depressing, and the washed out color scheme only adds to the effect. Well, what about the cast? I was really excited to see Christian Bale as John Connor, but his talents felt really wasted here. He had little more to do than talk in a deep voice and brood. And then finally at the end he got to actually do something, but even then it was all just soulless action, there was no character to it. Who would've though the role of John Connor would be so thankless. Bryce Dallas Howard plays his wife Kate Connor, and she's perhaps the most like able character. I don't know why, she just seems to have so much more soul than the others, because she's never just demoted to blasting Terminators with machine guns. She gets to support John throughout his struggles, and the actress does it well. Of course, we can't forget to mention Sam Worthington's nearly emotionless performance. Yes, he's a Terminator, and he plays the part of an emotionless machine perfectly, but not in a good way. I didn't care about this character, or his totally replaceable girl friend, so the main story of the movie was unrelateable to me. The sub plot with John and Kyle wasn't too bad, I had some interest in that, but the entire Sam Worthington arc was just boring to me. But to be brutally honest, the John Connor story line wasn't even all that good. For one thing, having John not actually be the resistance's leader is pretty lame, and also the entire operation to destroy the machines's stronghold just feels so by the numbers. It's just like someone will say, 'hey, we need to do this!' and then they do it. Next scene! There is almost no time for any character development or any passion to be put into this movie. Well, surely a Terminator movie can at least have some good action right? Let me just say that if you thought Arnie on the crane in Terminator 3 was over the top, you won't last five minutes in this movie. The final battle where John fights the Arnold Terminator was good, but it just kept going on and on and on... Until I just got bored. In a fight involving Christian Bale as John Connor and a CGi recreation of Arnold Schwarzenneger as a Terminator, I got bored. That is actually impressive. I'm sorry to hate on this movie so much, I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't get invested in this movie whatsoever.",5,1,4,1 July 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Thrilling, action packed, and smart
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger, and complements it nicely. Most sequels just go for the overused formula of bigger equals better, which rarely works out well. This time, the second movie is the continuation of the first, contrasting the differences between modern day and the time Captain America lived in. Things aren't so black and white in this movie, for awhile Cap doesn't know who to trust, and is just going off his guy instinct about what to do. This movie is about everything Captain America believes in being torn down, with SHIELD and with the Winter Soldier. Spoiler: The Winter Soldier is Bucky Barnes, Steve's best friend, so watching Steve have to fight him, is very emotional. Not only that, but the Winter Soldier is a very menacing villain. So, yes, I really liked the way they played off of the first one with this movie, and I thought that was a very good dynamic. The cast is great this time, even better than in the first movie. Chris Evans is better than ever in the titular role, and Scarlet Johansen delivers once again as the Black Widow, though her role isn't as well written this time around. Samuel L. Jackson also reprises his role as Nick Fury, and he and Cap play off of each other really well, because they each have their own contrasting ways of doing things, and as you can imagine there's a lot of friction from that. Anthony Mackie's The Falcon is a good addition, as he brings some extra charm to the movie. And, to go back to what I said earlier, I think The Winter Soldier is the perfect villain for this movie, and I much prefer him to the Red Skull, as he provides some actual menace to Captain America, as well as his numerous allies. And for the hard-core comic book fans, there's even a minor role of Crossbones. I also think this movie boasts some better action scenes, with car chases, shootouts, and three different super-heroes all running around and using their own gimmicks. The most noteworthy are (though it is very brief) the elevator scene where Cap dispatches at least a dozen Hydra cronies in an elevator, after giving them all the chance to back out. So cool! The final battle between Cap and Winter Soldier also delivers on some really hard-hitting emotion as well as a very tense duel, as they are standing on a cat-walk, really high in the air. This is the quintessential Captain America movie here, but then again so is the first one, it's just that they each tell a different type of Captain America story, each one equally iconic. Most superhero movies in a series tell a very similar story, so it was very refreshing to see something so different. I just hope that the Civil War will live up to the first two, giving us something original, instead of just two and a half hours filled with poorly timed jokes and so many characters you need an index to keep up with them. Which brings me to another point: the tone. There are jokes in this movie, but they are timed well, and they feel more intelligent. These feel like things real people would say, not jokes bordering on fourth-wall breaking. I also like the way they handled such a large cast, in that each character was well developed, but we had a clearly defined main cast. In the end Captain America the Winter Soldier is a great movie, with a stellar cast, great action, a great story, a good tone, and makes for a great follow up to the first one.",9,0,1,10 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Slow at times, but the story and action make up for the flaws
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* If you remember, I was one of the few who did not hate The Phantom Menace, in fact, I gave it a positive rating. If you'd like to get a different opinion on the prequels, please be sure and check that review out as well, but now, let's talk about The Attack of The Clones. This movie has a few rough spots, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman don't have very good chemistry together, despite both of them giving decent performances in the rest of the movie. No, Hayden Christensen isn't that bad, he's a bit wooden, but I think he plays a believable confused young man who has been isolated all his life. In fact, I think that most of the hate surrounding Christensen is less about how he plays his role, and more about what role he's playing. People don't want Vader to be a bitter and over- reacting teenager, but in the scenes where Christensen is able to show who he'll become, he's great. Besides, this is all about how Anakin becomes Vader, he can't start out as Vader in Episode II. The movie also gets heat for other stuff, too boring, too much CGI, etc. The CGI effects look great, it makes it look like a more advanced culture, by having surroundings that we can't yet physically create. Now, maybe a few practical effects wouldn't have been amiss, but I think the use of CGI is a relatively minor complaint, and one that doesn't really effect the over-all quality of the film. The plot may be slow at times, but don't forget, we have lots of action in here as well. A full scale battle at the end, a high speed chase through Courscant, a duel between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, etc. Yes there are slow stretches, but there are also plenty of scenes that are really fun. I know Yoda fighting with a light-saber, you know, a Jedi's weapon, is supposed to be just like heresy or something, but I can't take that complaint seriously. How else would Yoda have fought? With a stick? It's not like he doesn't use the force or anything! But enough with the negatives, let's talk about why this movie is genuinely good. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan is great! He brings the right level of sophistication and intelligence to the character, while still managing to seem like a less experienced version of the character in A New Hope. Jango Fett is a really good villain, he brings in great action and is just over all a really cool character. I already said I like Hayden Christensen, who I think accurately displays youth, and provides a relate-able character for everyone who's ever been a teenager ever. The action is top-notch as well. The speeder chase on Courscant is a great start to the movie; humor, good effects, and very fast-paced. The finale is very well done also, and it's a blast to see the first full scale battle in a Star Wars movie (the gungans don't count). The story, thought admittedly a bit muddled, is interesting enough (let's be honest, Star Wars isn't story based, it is driven by characters and action). I understand very few will agree with this review, but I wanted to give my own opinion on the Star Wars movies, so, I started reviewing them. I'll try to have my Revenge of the Sith review up soon!",7,39,61,19 June 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Classic fun
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Captain America: The First Avenger is a fun movie with lots of action, and a touching story line. We as the audience grow to care about Steve Rogers because we see him as a guy who is down on his luck. That way, when he does become the superhero, we feel a sense of triumph, because we see this little guy becoming the ultimate fighting force for freedom. This is a common theme in superhero movies, but this movie nailed that perfectly. The choice to set this in the 1940's and show us Cap's golden years before he came to the modern day may have been a turn off for some, but I thought it was handled excellently. The fact that this guy really believes in the good o'l fashioned American ideals is hard to swallow for every character in this movie. And they play off of that really, really well. The final scene where Cap is forced to crash the plane and ultimately send himself into the present day is very tragic, and Peggy's reaction to hearing him die over the radio is heart- breaking. As I've already hinted, I think Chris Evans is really good as Captain America, and I think they handled his character next to perfectly. The supporting cast is great, we have Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell as Agent Carter, and Howard Stark. We also have a villain for parts of this movie: The Red Skull. I like Hugo Weaving's Red Skull, but I don't think they handled him all that well in the movie. The Red Skull should just be the anti-thesis of Captain America, and he is, but they don't ever really drive that point home. It's just there, and it doesn't really go anywhere. Really, he just feels like a generic Nazi super-villain with super- strength for Cap to fight. I still like the character, but I just have a few gripes with how he was handled, that's all. In the end, Captain America: The First Avenger is a good, fun movie, with a great cast, some great action, a great theme, a good tone, and a good story.",8,2,3,10 June 2015
Man of Steel," Good effects and visuals, but some obvious weak links
","*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS* Man of Steel was a very divisive movie, some people loved it, some hated it, and there were a few who were just like 'meh'. There is a lot to like about Man of Steel, it's got good action, the cast is all good, and it is nice to finally see Superman actually fight stuff. The problem though, is that this doesn't feel like Superman. I'll explain more in a bit, but just let me take a brief detour to say that, I wasn't overly bothered by the destruction. It was a too much at times, and done in such a realistic way that it isn't fun to see, but having destruction in there didn't bother me. What bothered me was that Superman didn't do anything about it. This movie would go from good to great if amidst all the destruction, Superman had to save people. Like in the fight with Zod, he flies over an oil-tanker Zod hurled at him which proceeds to destroy an entire building. Superman wouldn't do that. Superman would've stopped the tanker, even though it would've left himself vulnerable to Zod. What makes Superman a hero is that he's more that his powers. He's not just a brawler, he saves people. He does save the planet in this movie but he never actually saves individual people (aside from Lois and his mom). The whole Superman killing Zod thing didn't bother me, though. In that situation, Superman would've had to kill Zod. There was no other way out of it, it was Zod or well, everyone else. I hope it is used as a plot point in future movies, such as helping to develop Superman's no killing rule. But there is still a lot to like about this movie. Michael Shannon is a great Zod, and brings some actual personality and depth to the character. Henry Cavil is a good Superman as well, despite the flaws that I already mentioned (which is more a fault of the writers). Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are also good as the Kents. The flashbacks are actually done really well, as it shows us how Clark became who he is. And what I really like seeing in Superman movies is the exploration of his character (which is more complex than most people realize). Amy Adams also does a good job as Lois Lane, who is finally portrayed with some intelligence. Laurence Fishburne is a good (if underused) Perry White. So, yes, I still liked and enjoyed this movie, even though I think it is obviously flawed.",8,1,2,23 August 2015
Face_Off," Classic over-the-top ridiculous fun
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Okay, so imagine a movie starring two of the biggest over-actors ever, and directed by the director of Mission Impossible 2, where said over-actors play each other. Yes, that is the plot of Face/Off, and the movie is one of the most entertaining movies ever. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be funny (I think it was), but it was hilarious. Watching Nic Cage play an exaggerated version of himself, and John Travolta do the same, was one of the funniest movie concepts ever. John Woo (the director) should also not go uncredited, as he adds his own blend of cheesy fun to the mix by playing the entire thing with a straight face. Well, sort of, if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean, if you haven't, let me explain. There are a few action scenes where the characters are doing the most ridiculous stunts you can imagine, and then we get some slo-mo and cheesy, melodramatic music to accompany it. This movie doesn't sound like it would be so great, but it is. This movie is long, but it was an absolute blast from beginning to end. But, we've covered the humor already, let's talk about the cast a little more thoroughly. I am a big Nicolas Cage fan, and think the guy is very funny, and his mere presence makes almost any movie worth watching. John Travolta I haven't seen in much besides this, but his acting skills don't seem as impressive. In this movie he's very funny, but I think that might be the script more than anything else, because basically we get to see two people playing Nicolas Cage. Yeah, if you can imagine that, you'll know you're in for a big treat with this movie. There are a few co-stars, who are hardly noticeable next to Cage and Travolta who chew up screen time, but they are there. Castor Troy has a machine gun toting girl-friend who guns down dozens of cops who attack their base, but she's still treated as a hero, and Archer (in Troy's body) is okay with it. The implausibility of the movie is part of what makes it so good. Troy has some other buddies, none of whom do much, and then there's Archer's family and friends. Literally every other FBI agent hunting Troy is faceless, none of them have any personality and I don't remember any of their names, but that's okay. Travolta and Cage provide enough personality for a whole trilogy. Archer's wife is a decent actress, but again, it's a pretty thankless role. Archer's daughter is pretty generic, but she gets a bit more personality, and brings it a very funny moment when Troy (in Archer's body) attacks her boyfriend. It's funnier than it sounds. The action is insanely over-the-top, kind of like Mission Impossible 2 action, but slightly toned down. However, it is over-the-top in a funny way. In the end Face/Off is a hilarious movie filled with great dialogue, very funny acting, over-the-top action, and a crazy story. If you want to see the quintessential crazy Nicolas Cage movie, watch Face/Off. You won't be disappointed.",7,1,3,13 June 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man," One of the best superhero movies of all time
","* MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* This is an unpopular opinion, but I think this movie is excellent. Andrew Garfield is the perfect Spider-man, and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is also really good. The selling point of this movie is the relationship between Peter and Gwen and how well it is developed. The two stars are actually a real life couple, so their romance scenes feel 100 percent authentic. The villain, The Lizard, isn't one of the more memorable Spider-man villains in this movie, but that's fine because he's one of the few that isn't incredibly over-the-top. I also thought that the origin story was handled much better this time, and I'm glad that they re-told it. Uncle Ben's death was handled better, as well as his delivery of the Responsibility catch phrase. The effects are stunning, and I really appreciate that they took the time to show us all of Spider-man's stunts. Along with the great acting, I also love that this wasn't just another by-the-numbers MCU movie, and that the film makers decided to make this film feel special. It doesn't just feel like, oh, yeah, people have seen this kind of thing hundreds of times, let's skip to the jokes. No, it feels like 'Let's make the definitive Spider-man movie. Let's make the best Spider-man movie possible.' This is a great movie with great characters, excellent effects, a really good tone, and a good story. I love this movie.",9,2,5,8 June 2015
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," This movie manages to be both boring and ridiculous; good job!
","Normally when I write a review, I like to leave a little time where I just kind of introduce the movie, without actually giving you my opinion, but not this time, no I just want to dive right in and tell you what I thought. I didn't really expect to like this movie,and I was right. The movie drags... it drags something awful. It's 2.5 hours long, and it's the first half of a book that was like four hundred pages (maybe less, I'm not sure) nor was the plot particularly involved, and there were only like two characters who actually got an development, so this time is really unwarranted. I will admit that I've never been the biggest LOTR fan, they're fine movies, but they're really long, and there's not enough depth to the characters to really get me that interested. Like I say, they're fine movies, just not my favorites. This movie though, I don't even see the appeal. I'm going to make a comparison here that might ruffle a few feathers, but okay, whatever. The Hobbit movies are like The Star Wars prequels. That's how I see the Hobbit movies (though for the record, I don't hate the Star Wars prequels like everyone else seems to). They're dumb, long, overly boring, and they just shamelessly rip off the originals and in a sense, ruin their legacy. But what about this movie makes it so bad? Let me give you an example. Our protagonist, Bilbo, is just your average kinda hobbit guy who just likes to relax, who Gandalf wants to bring on this adventure for some reason. It takes him like forty-five minutes to go on this quest. Forty- five. Minutes. The movie also just stops at a point, and shows them in elf land just hanging out and...just sitting there. They just sit there for awhile, talk some about boring stuff and then the movie continues. Another point I've stressed heavily is how cartoonish this movie is. Like, they go to sleep in a cave, and it's a Goblin cave or something, so naturally the floor is a trapdoor, that they just pop open, and send our heroes plunging down a huge pit, seriously, like fifty feet at least, and no one's seriously injured. We also have an orc guy with mechanical arm for the villain who sticks around way too long. Let's also just hold a moment of silence where in a live action movie, being shown in theaters around the world, with a PG-13 rating, a man rides off on a sled...pulled by rabbits. Yeah, none of that is made up. Let's also mention all these characters we've got. Bilbo who's just... a guy, who wants to relax... Thorin a...dwarf who wants to get his kingdom back and who... doesn't like Bilbo, plus a dozen faceless, bumbling dwarfs... at least we got Gandalf.",4,3,5,18 October 2015
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Fun, lots of tension, and some good performances really sell this
","*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS* Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, the fourth M:I movie, combines a lot of the good elements of the previous three movies. There's a smart story, with the on-the-run aspect that we've had so many times in this series, but this one does it probably the best. They really do have some weaknesses, they don't have all the resources the usually do. One thing that bumped this movie up a few points is that the plans the heroes lay don't actually work, they have to improvise, lots of bad stuff happens, and we get to see Ethan Hunt and crew come up with new plans on the fly. That was really fun to see, especially since that hadn't happened before in the M:I series. I thought the main cast gave really strong performances, as well. Not like Oscar winning performances, but for a spy-action movie these performances were pretty good. Out of all four of the movies, this was the movie where Cruise gave the best performance, and Jeremy Renner was a nice addition as well. And then, there's the stunt. The stunt to end all stunts, the most famous stunt ever. I am of course, talking about Tom Cruise climbing up the side of the building. I don't know all the technical stuff about how they shot it, and I don't want to, what I do know is that it looks amazing. This will sound fake, but this is 100% true. My hands were sweating throughout this entire scene. I don't know why, I mean, I know he won't die, but still, it's just like... yeah. Probably one of the tensest scenes in any movie ever. There's some good action here, that's just y'know, standard spy martial arts kind of fighting, but what really makes this movie so exciting was all the tension. I already mentioned the climb, but there's also the finale, where they're trying to stop a nuke from blowing up the U.S., and they're just in four different places, trying to stop all these things from happening. For example, Cruise is trying to get a case back to stop the missile, and it keeps getting shifted onto different platforms going up and down, while he and the villain fight to get it. Eventually the villain gets it, and leaps to his death with it. The whole scene is really tense, and the conclusion is just like... oh no, how...? So in the end, I had a lot of fun with this movie, it's action packed, very suspenseful, has great acting, and even has a pretty good story. Like every other M:I movie, aside from the third one, this has a pretty weak villain, but aside from that, this movie is really good.",7,0,0,13 July 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Very underrated
","*WARNING CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS* I was one of the rare few who found the first Amazing Spider-man movie to be really good, so I was definitely looking forward to asm 2. I wasn't disappointed. This did what a good 2 movie should do, it gave us a really good villain. Electro was a great villain, who was very menacing. Harry Osborn was another great villain, and he had a clearly explored back story and motivation. Combine the two and you get the perfect villain. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are still in-arguably great as the leads, and their chemistry together is top-notch. The effects are even better this time around (which is really saying something), and these are possibly the best effects I've ever seen. This movie keeps a great tone, in that it has some funny moments, but it knows when to be serious, and that's the tone I want from a Spider-man movie. I'm still not 100 percent sure how I feel about Gwen's death. It made a nice conclusion to the series, but if they had wanted to make more, they would've needed Gwen alive. There are a few too many plot-lines, and that's why I rate this a bit under the first movie, but I still give the story a thumbs-up. In conclusion, I think this movie was really good, with great characters, perfect visual effects, a good story, that occasionally got too muddled, and a good tone. I was really sad to hear that this great series was getting thrown out to make way for another bland MCU movie with forced humor and no tension. This could've been one of my top five favorite trilogies of all time, now it'll be my favorite double-feature. This was a great send off to a great series.",8,1,2,8 June 2015
Jurassic World," A very good movie; tension, humor, action, and good characters
","*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS* Well, it's been fourteen years since the last Jurassic Park movie, but now, we finally get another one... and it was worth the wait. Look, I'm not going to act like this was better than the first one, or even as good, but this was still a good movie, and a whole lot of fun. It combined elements of all three of the previous films, and added their own ideas to the mix, and the combo really worked. This time around, we have a new dinosaur, the Indominus Rex, which was pretty scary actually. It had camouflage, and wasn't fooled by lack of motion like the T-Rex was. They call out in the movie that the I- Rex is more powerful than the T-Rex, which immediately makes it feel more dangerous. We also see a fully armed attack team of soldiers take on the I-Rex, which we never saw with either the Tyrannosaurs or the Spinosaurus, which once again, makes it feel much more dangerous. If they just constantly thwart the same dinosaur, the movie loses the tension, but if you add in new dinosaurs, then it just keeps getting more and more tense. I also liked that they brought back the pterranadons (sorry if I'm spelling these names wrong) from JP 3, because I think having flying dinosaurs was a nice touch, and it gives us something smaller, that the heroes can fight back against. But now let's talk about the characters some, since without good characters, it's just watching dinosaurs run around and eat people. Again, these characters aren't quite like those from JP-1, but they're still pretty good. Chris Pratt does a good job of being Owen Grady, the raptor trainer. That was a really good dynamic, and Pratt obviously toned down his natural personality a bit, so the movie would still feel more serious, and he did that really well. He's still got the signature Pratt quips, but he's not just totally goofy. Bryce Dallas Howard also does a good job as the negligent Aunt Claire. She was also a totally new character, one more concerned with profit and attendance than nature, which was a really good twist on the typical JP characters, and they didn't make it out like she was evil just because she wasn't all about non-interference (yes, Lost World, you handled that message pretty poorly). Hoskins, the guy who wants to use the dinosaurs as military weapons, is also a good addition, if a bit clichéd. I like having a human character being featured as the side villain, so I appreciated his inclusion. The two kids gave surprising performances; their story was actually kind of touching, and they seemed to be decent actors. This is by far the most action packed JP movie to date. Soldiers with guns, pterodactyls on the loose, dinosaurs fighting each other, it was good. I liked seeing some more action, though the end fight with the T-Rex and the raptors ganging up on the I-Rex was... it was different. I'm not sure if I liked it or not, but it was a nice change of pace. There are so many character arcs and stories in this movie, I can't do them all justice, so I won't try, but they are handled well, and I appreciate that. The story itself though, that's handled very well. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end. It was refreshing to see a summer blockbuster that didn't have to set up for three of four sequels, and just told a story. There is one plot point that wasn't resolved, but that was a good touch, that way there is room for sequels, but there don't have to be (considering all the money this movie has made in its opening though, there will be sequels). In conclusion, Jurassic World was a very good movie; fun, tense, good action and characters, very good effects, and was a great follow up to the original classic.",8,0,4,17 June 2015
Mission: Impossible II," Bad, just bad
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* The first Mission Impossible movie took an unexpected twist on the regular spy formula, and went in for investigation and suspense instead of action. This movie works more as a generic James Bond movie, think along the lines of Die Another Day. Tom Cruise goes from being the guy who is not skilled what-so-ever in hand-to-hand combat, to being... this. John Woo, the director, abuses slo-mo in this movie as well, making all of the fights... pretty boring actually. It's just watching slo-mo flips and kicks for the last half hour of this movie. If you look at the opening credits, the movie will make a lot more sense, because there you will see: produced by Tom Cruise. Okay, enough formless hating, let's sift through all the insanity, and talk about what does and does not work in this movie. Let's start with what does, because that's a much shorter list. Now, adding some action in was not a bad idea, maybe they might have handled it poorly, but we'll get to that in a minute. Adding in a villain was also a good idea, and making him an evil counterpart to Ethan Hunt was also a good idea, but once again, the execution was handled pretty poorly. I even think the idea of a genetic virus called Chimera could've been a good plot point, but... well, it wasn't. Now, I'd like to talk about what I always thought was the most glaring problem here, the complete change in styles. As I said, MI 1 was an intelligent investigation movie, and this is a rip off of James Bond movies. The two don't go together at all. And, yes I understand with the MI setup of different directors, you're going to have differences, but this movie isn't just directed differently, it's also directed badly. Also, let's be honest, this movie is little more than a Tom Cruise ego trip disguised as a real movie. And since Tom Cruise seems to think he has to just be some perfect agent or whatever, it's hard to connect to his character, especially when he's paired up with Thandie Newton, because the two have like the worst on screen chemistry. Dougry Scott, who plays the villain, does not give a good performance either, despite the fact that his character could've been a good villain. An evil Ethan Hunt? C'mon, how can you go so wrong with that idea? The plot, if you can call it that, seems like just a bunch of random events thrown together, and it is very confusing at times, but at the same time incredibly stupid, if that makes any sense. See, the first one was confusing, but this one just doesn't make any sense because it's so ridiculous. On one final point, I know that the first movie was very cheesy, and was just supposed to be entertaining, but this one doesn't have the lack of self-seriousness, it's like two hours of Tom Cruise going, 'Oh yeah, I'm awesome!' Because, it's like they take all these ludicrous stunts seriously, so it's hard to have fun with the movie, aside from laughing at how bad it is. In conclusion, Mission: Impossible II is a bad movie, with a weak and under utilized cast, bad directing, a wasted story, and some very bad action scenes.",4,0,1,16 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," An entertaining movie, but suffers from a variety of problems
","* WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!* Avengers: Age of Ultron is a decent movie, which provided me with a fairly entertaining movie to kill two and a half hours with, but it was a bit disappointing when compared with the original. One problem I (and a lot of people apparently) had was that there were too many characters and plot lines to keep up with. Thor is hardly in the movie at times (seriously, did anyone see him in the finale?). I also thought the finale dragged, because it was just watching the Avengers smash robots who couldn't even give them any opposition. Most will disagree, but the light-hearted tone of the MCU is wearing very thin, and can really spoil the tension. The positives are that its really fun, has good characters, and a it is funny at times. I think the most well-written scenes are those between Black Widow and Hulk, though their romance feels a little out of the blue. If you like the light-hearted tone, you'll probably like this more, but if you don't, I can't see you liking this movie.",7,1,5,7 June 2015
Mission: Impossible," Confusing, over-the-top, but fun and smart
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Now that I've reviewed Mission: Impossible III, which I just watched, I decided to go back and review the first two MI movies, and give you my thoughts. I understand how someone would like this movie more than I do, and I can see myself liking it more on a future viewing, but as it stands now, I just think this movie is okay. I think Tom Cruise does a pretty good job as Ethan Hunt, but, and you won't hear me say this often, I thought the movie was shot poorly. The way it was shot, and just the general look of the movie made it look like it was made in 1960. Maybe that's what they were going for, but it kind of threw me. Another thing that threw me, and I get that this was intentional, was that there was almost no fighting. There are suspenseful scenes, which I will get to in just a minute, but there aren't any shootouts, and there is only one brief fistfight and a chase scene, that's it. I like that they tried to make a different spy-thriller type movie, but they could've included a bit more action, though I do think this was an interesting idea. I'm not saying it was necessarily bad, I'm just saying I expected something... different. Despite my complaints against this movie, I can't deny that I had an absolute blast watching it. The break-in at the HQ building was very tense, but also very funny. The two don't sound like they'd work well together, but I think they mixed the two styles very nicely in this scene. The investigation was rather confusing to me, maybe I just missed some crucial plot point, but I was lost for a large chunk of this movie, which might have hurt my opinion a bit. This movie also doesn't really have a villain, exactly. It's more about Ethan on the run, and trying to figure out what's going on, but the villain, Job, is in the movie... maybe ten minutes, and it's not like he's even an opposing force when he's not on screen, there's just... no villain. The fight on the train though, that was an excellent scene. Action- packed, suspenseful, and very entertaining. Unlike 2 and 3, this movie is certainly not playing it with a straight face, this is obviously going for a humorous tone, and I think they pulled it off well. In the end Mission: Impossible was a fun movie, despite my problems with it, it had good characters, some good tension, and a smart, if confusing story.",7,0,0,15 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Dark, action-packed, emotional, simply great
","*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS* Out of all three of the prequels, Revenge of the Sith is the only one where it is not too uncommon to like it. Most people hate it, or at least dislike it, but there are still those of us who love this movie. And I am one of those, because this movie is almost perfect. Almost. The special effects are dazzling, the space combat looks so much more sleek now that Lucas upgraded to CGI, and did away with models (a controversial move, but personally I think it was the right choice, I mean, you can't argue with these results). A lot of people complained about the first two movies being too boring, but Lucas knew what he was doing. He was building up to the war, and now it's here. And now... it's all out war! I can't cover all of the great battles in this movie, because there are a lot, and trying to do all of those justice is...daunting. However, I will point out a few of the highlights. Of course there is the best light-saber duel ever when Anakin and Obi-Wan finally have their big duel. It has just about everything you could want from a light-saber duel. Action-wise it's the best, emotionally it's the best, it has a great environment, and the exchange between Anakin and Obi-Wan before they fight is so epic, I've tried to memorize that whole speech (yes, I'm a nerd, I know). Yoda and Sidious also have a pretty great duel; watching the two most powerful people in the universe fight it out is pretty much guaranteed to be entertaining, and it pays off. But it's not all about the action, the characters are great as well. Hayden Christensen does a really good job at playing the conflicted, bitter, and angry Anakin Skywalker. His previous performance was a bit shaky (though I personally liked it), but here, he's really good. Natalie Portman doesn't have a lot to do in this movie, but she's still fine. Some of her reactions to Anakin's fall are a little... overblown. Ewan McGregor is also really good, after Anakin's fall, you can tell he's really effected by it, and he's trying to not let it show, and he does a good job with that as well. Palpatine is also a great character, his subtle manipulations of the Republic are a good plot-point, and seeing him finally cut loose and let the Jedi have it is very entertaining. For me though, the tone and themes of this movie are what really makes it great. It has an ominous tone going the whole time, which is y'know, how it should be. There's no comic relief in this movie, though we still get a little trademark Star Wars banter. Anakin's fall to the dark side is tragic, and the final battle between him and Obi-Wan is both heartbreaking and exhilarating. And... wow, I'm really going to get a lot of hate for this, but... here goes. Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is... the best Star Wars movie of all time, and will likely remain the champ forever. There, I said it. I know this review will disagree with popular opinion, and I'm not doing this to rile up the prequel haters. I am doing this to put out my very controversial opinion of the Star Wars prequels, because frankly, all the prequel hate is getting annoying, and I'm going to do my part to give the prequels the respect they deserve. Thank you, George Lucas, for making this great movie, which is, as I said, the best Star Wars movie ever.",9,4,8,21 June 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Spectacular, a stunning conclusion to a great trilogy
","*WARNING CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS* This is it, the sequel to the stunningly successful Dark Knight, and the final installment to Christopher Nolan's trilogy. I understand that, while this movie did get a lot of fans, there were a lot of people who didn't like this movie, but I personally loved this. It's almost as good as The Dark Knight. Obviously Heath Ledger isn't in it, but Bane, while no Joker, is a great villain. While Joker was the antithesis to Batman, Bane is like is dark double. Also a former member of the league of shadows, Bane is a very menacing villain, who trashes Batman the first time they fight. And that was a very bold move. Rarely is the hero ever defeated so definitively by the villain, but this really helped the story. But I'll get back to the characters in a bit, right now I want to talk about the story. One thing I really liked was that Bruce, who is no longer the Batman at the start, didn't just put the cape and cowl back on and become the Batman again. No, he had to go on an emotional journey first, culminating when he finally climbed out of the pit, proving he could do what Bane did, meaning that Bane was no longer in any way his superior. That segment with him in the pit was incredible. That was probably my favorite part of the movie. I mean, yeah, the takeover of Gotham was good, as well as Catwoman's betrayal and redemption, but that stuff in the the pit, that was just so great. I also liked how Christopher Nolan managed to tie into the previous two installments, but still keep TDKR's identity. So I already said how much I liked Bane, now let's talk about Christian Bale's Batman. He's great. He is my favorite Batman by far (with respect to Kevin Conroy and Michael Keaton). I thought Bale got to give an even better performance this time, as there was a bit more to his character. Bruce Wayne/Batman is a very multi-faceted character, and they really explored his character a lot in this movie, and I was very pleased with that. Marion Cottilard plays Miranda Tate, and I think she gives an alright performance. Her performance isn't bad, but when compared to people like Bale and Hardy, she just doesn't really stand out. Though, the twist that she was actually Talia al Ghul was a great one; very shocking. Now... I have a confession to make. Anne Hathaway... you are my favorite version of Catwoman. I know, Michelle Pfeiffer did a great job, but Anne Hathaway really got to explore her character more, Catwoman is a character that can't just be called a villain, or a hero, or even anti-hero. Because she's all three. Michelle Pfeiffer didn't really get to do a whole lot of that, but Anne Hathaway did, and she did a great job. I really liked her character, and, even though she wasn't in there all that much, I still really enjoyed her character. Now on one final note I would like to comment on the first fight with Batman and Bane. As I said, that fight, from a story and character standpoint was very bold, but action wise it was also great. There are some really good moves getting tossed around, as well as some great dialogue. 'Peace has made you weak; victory has defeated you.' Great. Line. Also, if you compare this to the fights between Batman and Joker in the previous one, they are very different. The fights with Joker were fast and kept in close quarters. In both fights with Bane, the two move around a whole lot, and it's a lot more slow. Not like, boring slow, but it's more of the building tension type feel. Obviously there are some other great action scenes, but the ones with Bane and Batman fighting each other are the ones that stand out. Though Batman and Catwoman clearing out the corridors of Bane's goons together was another great scene. The actors deserve a lot of credit for this movie, but I think Nolan deserves a lot of praise too. He is a very good director, and a genius. Thank you Christopher Nolan, for concluding such a great trilogy, with such style. This is a bold statement, but The Dark Knight Trilogy may very well be my favorite trilogy of all time.",9,2,5,6 July 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Fun, thrilling, and epic; a bold new reintroduction to Star Wars
","WARNING CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS!The Force Awakens is quite possibly the most anticipated movie of all time, and I was one of the many who was really looking forward to it. And this movie was a lot of what I wanted from a new Star Wars movie. There are new characters, who happen to be the main characters. I know a lot of people didn't like all the throwbacks (more on that later) but I still think this movie introduced a great new style for Star Wars movies. It had a lot of similarities to the originals, but it had a separate style from both the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy. So the first thing I want to complement on is the characters. Rey is a great protagonist. She's likable, relatable, and she is well developed. We get to know her gradually over the movie, and we learn more and more about her. People have pointed out that her transformation into a Jedi at the end of the movie was a little sudden, and I suppose that's true, but I think it was better than making us wait until episode eight to see a Jedi again. But as much as I liked Rey, there was one character who outshone every character to one degree or another. And that was Kylo Ren. Saying Kylo is the next Darth Vader wouldn't really be accurate, because what's so great about Kylo is that he wasn't written as a villain. Vader was always written as a villain, even though he was redeemed. Kylo was just a character, who had just as many deft touches to his personality as any other character would. It's something to see a villain who doesn't have to be written as always calm, collected, and control of everything. You can tell he has to try and act menacing, because on the inside he's just a scared kid. Like a lot of people who are usually protagonists, he idolizes someone and wants to live up to them, the only thing is his role model is Darth Vader. Another interesting thing about him was how he was a dark reflection of Anakin. Anakin started out as a good person who was trying to resist the Dark Side, whereas Kylo is basically a bad person who is trying to resist the light side. When he (SPOILER ALERT) kills Han Solo, it's really quite sad, and a lot more effective than Obi-Wan's or Qui-Gon's death. We'd gotten to know and love Han ever since A New Hope, and he was at or near the top of nearly every best Star Wars character lists. Finn was another good character, who was very different from other Star Wars characters, and was the first attempt made to humanize the soldiers of any side in a Star Wars movie. He had some legitimately funny lines, and managed to be a funny character who actually mattered. And even though Poe wasn't in the movie that much, I still think there's some potential for a good character there. I also think that The Force Awakens is the high point of acting of any Star Wars movie ever made. Even in the original trilogy, a lot of people gave kind of stiff performances, or would just come off as overblown and cheesy (like all the times someone screams 'noooooo!'), I'm not trying to disparage the previous six, but the acting wasn't nearly as good as it was here. Rey, Kylo, Finn, Poe, Han, Leia, and all the other characters felt believable and relatable. Harrison Ford gave a very good performance here, especially since he had to display a wide range of emotions.Another high point for this movie was the special effects, because they looked very convincing. I was admiring the effects when TIE fighters were blowing up in the space battle, but it was always story driven, it wasn't just like 'hey, look at those great effects!' In the original trilogy, the effects aren't convincing anymore because they were limited by the time, and in the prequels, as much as I like those effects, they still don't look real. Here, they seemed like a nice blend of CGI and practical effects, and it looked great.So to address the common complaint against this movie (that it's too much of a retread of A New Hope) isn't entirely unwarranted. It does revisit a lot of old plot points (Starkiller station/The Death Star and its destruction, the old mentor type guy is killed, the protagonist is stranded on a backwater planet at the start, etc.), but I still say that it was handled well. It was a nice bit of fan service, and most of those retreads were it was handled well. It was a nice bit of fan service, and most of those 'retreads' were shown in a different way (such as taking a poke at StarKiller Station's weak spot being so obvious) and Han's death was much more sudden and shocking than Obi-Wan's.
