The Avengers," Highest no story rating ever!
","Ever seen one of those muscle pageants where they flex and flex and flex and flex... and then they come back on and flex some more? Well, that's kind of what the Avengers is like. Nearly every scene is a huge climax and it's just a wet dream of adolescent violence and fantasy- with no one being held accountable for any character actions. I knew there wouldn't be much for story going into the big summer Marvel franchise comic book blockbuster, but I did expect an attempt at story. Look at Spiderman or to a lesser extent, Transformers. Sure, they sucked, but at least they tried. A blockbuster movie should be like a play to some extent, showing subtext and depth, rather than just defaulting on raw special effects exhibition. Why? Because these Billion dollar franchises can afford to hire the best writers in the world. But they don't. They feel that their numbers, data and formula will make them more money than the tried and true Aristotle/Socrates methods of portraying the human condition in a three act structure. And they're right. Money trumps all, for the film industry is at the end of the day, an industry that bases everything on huge profit margins (one the largest margins in the history of mankind, in fact).However, if you look at some of the masterpiece visual effects movies of the last few decades (which Avengers tried so hard to be), there is a common thread that puts them above the rest: They all engage in creative storytelling where characters are held accountable for their actions in some way, no matter what the level of fantasy is. That extra effort pays off in the subconscious and is the sole reason why a movie with effects alone can't give us the cerebral satisfaction of a Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Lord of the Rings, Avatar, Aliens, or Terminator 2. These type of films are like a Broadway show, giving you big climaxes and well timed beats. You could say The Matrix would be more like a Cirque du Soleil. The Avengers is like the body building pageant(as the Avengers themselves are constantly trying to out flex each other throughout the whole movie).I have a rule, regarding my 1-10 movie rating system: Any movie without a story can only score a maximum of 5 (flawless effects-great acting-no story, respectfully) This is not to say that all the writing was bad in The Avengers. The dialogue was actually quite clever- perfectly timed comic relief. It's strange that Hollywood is notoriously bad at delivering honest, unscathed human emotion and experience, but so good at delivering comic relief (one of the hardest things to do in all entertainment). Here's The Avengers story synopsis: All the leads are invincible- action, action, action- One of them has turned bad and tries to take over the world-action, action, action- he fails, but lives at the end to set up the sequel, action action, Roll credits. It literally plays like it was written by a 10 year old boy who plays with action figures in his back yard. (then spiced up by a team of ghost writers with well placed jokes and lots of Downey Jr. nuances) Wouldn't surprise me if that' what actually happened.Is Avengers worth watching? Yes. The acting is great (except for Scarlett Johnasson- who is brilliant in her own right, but NOT a believable superhero). It's funny and very intense. Big action, big sound, testosterone, gunfire, some bow&arrow action, missiles, gadgets, rocket powered things, aliens, a nuclear bomb, martial arts sequences, gunfire, even a touch of romance. A man's movie, through and through.But I'm not so sure. I think any good 'man' movie should actually have in depth storytelling (The Matrix, Aliens, Aeon Flux) Why not go the extra mile, guys? Comic book movies should be held to the task especially, because it was good storytelling that made their franchise pop in the first place. Film is a different medium. You can't just expect everyone to know all the backstory- and make things bad ass for the sake of seeing something bad ass. You have to work at it a lot harder to tell an effective story in an arena where you are being timed to 2 hours of attention span. Avengers fails, just like most comic book movies. Sin City is a great example of effectively crossing over from comic book (graphic novel) into the film medium.It would be nice if Hollywood spent just 1% of the 200,000,000.00 spent on a movie like this, toward paying a team of talented screen writers. Imagine if David Mamet had written this... or Aaron Sorkin? With all the money and power and technology and talented artists bursting at the seams (like the Hulk) to exhibit their skills... it just seems like a no brainer to show us what money can really buy.So, it's a no brainer movie. Just really good eye candy and a few laughs.",5,5,12,21 September 2012
Interstellar," Keeps getting better, and better, and better, and better, and BETTER!
","'Insomnia' is one of the top 200 films ever made. 'Inception' is one of the top 100 films ever made.'Interstellar' is one of the top 25 films ever made. All of Nolan's films are great. But this is better. This is something else. Granted, Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is one of the top 10 comic book films ever made, but Interstellar takes Nolan's career to a level few have achieved. This film forever cements Christopher Nolan's place in cinema history as it will no doubt be one of the highest Academy Award nominated films in history (we shall see this upcoming March). I feel sorry for the film 'Gravity.' That film was so ground breaking in the Sci Fi/Space genre... but it only held the torch for less than a year. Interstellar blows Gravity away, like the '91 Bulls would have overpowered and embarrassed any class B college basketball team. Gravity is amateur hour compared to Interstellar- it's not even the same sport. Bold statements, I know but anyone reading this will eventually see the film, and you'll understand what I mean. Interstellar is truly a masterpiece for any generation and will be considered a pillar of achievement a century from now, much like Star Wars, Jaws, 2001 and Lord of the Rings are permanent pillars of cinema achievement. This is one of those films that changes the conversation. There has never been any movie like it, and there will never be another one like it- only imitators. Having said all that, do I really feel like Interstellar is a 10 out of 10? No, of course not. I'd say it's a 9.5. So for IMDb, that means 10. It's not the best film ever made, but it's in the same conversation as The Matrix, Star Wars, Blade Runner, E.T., T2, Avatar, 2001, etc. From this point forward, you can't have a conversation about ground breaking visual effects films, or ground breaking space dramas without mentioning Interstellar. It's that innovative. It's so innovative, in fact, that the slow start, cliché elements and improbable story set up have absolutely no effect on the film once it's over. That is rare my friends. That is a film worth seeing! Interstellar starts out slow and is overly sentimental as you'll read in a lot of reviews. You'll read that because it's true. Some of the dialog is off and the initial premise is not believable. Matthew McConaughey is one of our finest actors, but it's just not probable that an old NASA test pilot turned farmer would be seeked out by the now 'secret' NASA who was looking for him but didn't know where to find him, and once he happens upon them by a supernatural premonition, they put him on a rocket ship a few days later with no exercise, conditioning, or up to date training. Oh and he only lives an hour drive away from NASA's secret facility. Usually a film with those kind of strikes in the first 20 minutes... you're heading for trouble. But Interstellar starts slow and keeps getting better, and better, and better, and better... until the entire audience's jaw is on the floor (To see what I mean, give a glance at the audience during the act 3 climax and you'll see something you don't see very often. Total immersion. And if you don't watch this in front of an audience on IMAX, you've missed the point.) By the time Act 2 begins, it's so powerful that none of Act 1 matters. Again, that is so rare. Only a master filmmaker can design a film in such a way. Act 3 is where cinema history is made. It wouldn't be proper to give any spoilers here, as this is a must see film. I will only say that Act 1 is good, but partially flawed... and Act 3 is so strong that it makes the plot holes of Act 1 totally irrelevant. That never happens. Don't miss Interstellar if you have a chance to see it on IMAX! But regardless of how you see it, or when; it's worth your time and money and you'll be hard pressed to find a better new movie, over the next few years- especially with the all time low quality of Hollywood blockbusters and special effects showcases. Few directors have a command of the craft of filmmaking like Christoper Nolan does. In fact, I don't think you could say there is anyone better than Christopher Nolan working right now. He may not have the body of work Spielberg, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, Fincher or Soderberg have... but in the sci fi genre, Nolan is currently the best filmmaker in the world. Or you could say he's second to only James Cameron. Interstellar is a gift to us all on the same level as Avatar. Enjoy!",8,17,36,7 November 2014
Now You See Me," The trick is on you if you pay 12.00 to see this movie!
","The movie is called 'Now You See Me.' And by that, I assume they were referring to the plot. Nice one guys- I was fooled! This is what happens when a screenwriter writes from the 'outside in' instead of the 'inside out.' It's all about outside elements (plot plot plot, twist twist twist) and no inside elements (human motivation/emotion). Honestly, I couldn't give a spoiler to this movie if I tried, because I have no idea what it is about. No-one does. It was just the filmmakers making up whatever cliché was convenient for them at the time and trying to twist the plot so much that YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. Oh spare me that horse crap! It's always sad when movies TRY to be 3 steps ahead of an audience.NEWS FLASH TO DIRECTOR Louis Leterrier. We're smart now. You know.. audiences. Maybe this flashy, celebrity packed mis-direction movie would have worked in the 90s, but unexplained magic tricks are boring to us now. We don't fall for stupid, predictable camera manipulation anymore.We know you've been rubbing one out to The Illusionist and The Prestige every night for the lat 3 years, but let's be honest... you can't one up The Illusionist, or the Prestige. Those are masterful movies that should be left alone. You might have been able to pull this off had it been a TV series. But you had about 20 plot points that went nowhere, because you have no time to develop anything substantial with a feature film with 20 plot points (Cloud Atlas being the only exception). When you finally revealed the big secret, the audience I was in was disinterested and distracted by all the gaping holes left over from Act 1. Forget Act 3. Car chase sequence? Really? (no that's not a spoiler, because it was not a central part to the story). Speaking of story... It was interesting that the filmmakers choose not to include back-story- or motives- or subtext, or indications of character inspiration, or clues onto what certain symbols meant. It was just all one big, fat convenient mystery that ends in the most overdone Hollywood cliché one can imagine. We didn't know who to root for. Just because Morgan Freeman looks like he does and talks like he does doesn't give you a free pass to bukkake your action sequence fantasy all over the screen. Morgan Freeman is not Marlin Brando. His presence doesn't transcend the story. Even Brando himself couldn't have made this a good movie, because you wouldn't have time to invest in him because it's BAM BAM BAM, next plot point, next plot point, twist, twist, twist. The audience was thinking, 'Hold on! Slow down! Wait, what? Huh?'Honestly, I don't want to waste any more of my time thinking about this turd. Just do yourself a favor and wait for it to come out on Redbox. At least then you'll only bitch about throwing away 1.50. (and you can get your grocery shopping done at the same time). Oh and BTW... we get it Louis Leterrier; you're French. Thanks for ramming the French thing down our throats the entire movie in characters and location.",1,12,22,21 June 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hallmark Hobbit
","On it's own, this film is a solid 8, by Hollywood blockbuster standards. However, because it's intentionally designed to work together with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, you can't have a conversation about a Hobbit movie without comparing it to one of the greatest achievements ever captured on film (LOTR). The Hobbit Unexpected Journey falls short of that bar by a considerable margin. It's not bad movie by any means. Go see it if you haven't! But it is disappointing. To use the parlance of our times, here's a win/fail operandi:Win: 1. GOLLUM'S CAVE- Stunning. 2. FIGHTS BETWEEN THORIN AND WHITE ORC- The rivalry is one dimensional, but very intense.3. GANDALF'S EAGLES- will leave your jaw open. 3. RIVENDALE- Rich with dialogue (although most of it was unnecessary as it foreshadowed what we already know will happen in LOTR), texture, and Gandalf subtext. Incredible acting and set design... and the Christopher Lee cameo was most welcome.4. MARTIN FREEMAN-Completely nailed it. Unassuming, matter-of-fact like. He was Bilbo. Fail: 1. RADAGAST- Really? A Santa Claus sleigh being towed by rabbits? Zipping back and forth across the hills, making Warg dogs chase it? It just looked ridiculous. Radagast was given about 30 minutes of slapstick screen time. He was over the top and animated like a Disney character- going cross-eyed while smoking marijuana from Gandalf's pipe- sure it got a chuckle, but it's cheesy and not consistent with the tone of the LOTR Trilogy. They could have done this character much better. 2. THE ROCK FIGHT SEQUENCE- Two mountains turn into human rock figures and duke it out for a good long while. It felt like a Transformers movie. Just too much staged action. 3. THE MUSIC- 75% of it was re-mixed from LOTR soundtrack. It was also very pompus and over the top at times- using unoriginal blockbuster orchestra templates. Hugely disappointing for Howard Shore. The original LOTR soundtrack was so groundbreaking. This was the biggest disappointment.4. AND WHAT IS A DWARF?- They didn't grow on you- plain and simple. They didn't act or behave like great warriors, like J.R.D. portrayed in Gimli. But rather, it was a Hallmark portrayal of Dwarvdom. There was no Gimli here. Not even close. Thorin was the only badass, and he looked and behaved nothing like a Dwarf. 5. THE TROLLS- Very Pixar/Disney like. Not consistent with the look or demeanor of the great Cave Troll in Fellowship of the Ring. And again, the slapstick thing has infected Peter Jackson's ability to tell the epic story on film. It worked for 'Meet the Feebles' or 'Dead Alive', but once he made LOTR, he set a new standard. Now we're watching a legend overstay his welcome. 6. THE MOUNTAIN ORC LEADER- Way too animated. This was the Jar-Jar Binks moment. He was like Java the Hut mixed with a less intelligent Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean. It was suspicious.7. 48 FRAMES PER SECOND- This ruined the entire movie-going experience. It took you out of the story and it made the entire production look like a BBC special. And no... we don't have to 'get used to it.' I'm so tired of that executive excuse. It doesn't work, period. It's shocking that Peter Jackson & studio made this bizarre decision. 24 frames per second is the only way to watch this film or any film. Don't buy into the hype. It's a way for the studios to make an extra 500 Million, because people want to see it both ways. It's disgusting. 48 frames per second is for sports and documentaries. It's technology being misused like the auto-tune. Even if you like the auto-tune effect in some music, you wouldn't want to hear Pink Floyd auto tuned, would you? The Hobbit has a few good scenes, a half dozen terrible scenes and a few GREAT scenes (Gollum's Cave is hands down the greatest achievement ever in motion capture acting. Andy Serkis' performance in this film really should prompt the Academy to open a new category). But it seems Peter Jackson isn't as hungry this time around. Too much collaboration with Steven Spielberg has clearly clouded his judgment over the last 15 years.",6,6,19,15 December 2012
The Mist," I think this is a fair review:
","-This is for those who have seen the film and didn't think it was the 'Best movie ever' First of all, let me say that the director Frank Darabont is a terrific director and has made two of my top 100 all time favorite films... The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile.However, this was like watching Ken Griffy Jr. step up to the plate, swing and miss. I was extremely disappointed. I was told that this was scary and that the ending was one of the best endings EVER. I don't take that too lightly, especially when it's written on the cover of the DVD. I know it was a horror film, I know it wasn't supposed to be taken too literally, but come on... people don't behave the way they behaved in The Mist. Here are a few things that made me write this comment- 1. There's no way they would have let Marcia Gay Harden (who was one of the few good actors) have that kind of power over them. Whether she was a profit or not. And if she did have that power... surely she would have gotten the gun, or been aware that someone might try to shoot her if she held up our 'protagonists' at knifepoint with her new posse (consisting of the town folk who had no business being in a posse) 2. The dialogue was tough to sit through. It just seemed forced and unrealistic.3. The characters were rough as well. With the exception of the two leads... they were mediocre actors who were following lines in a script. There was no depth to the characters and hardly any subtext. The subtext that was provided was pointless.. because the ending showed us that the whole movie was kind of pointless.4. The army guys. Hated them. Their characters sucked. Sorry Frank, but they sucked. What they just decide to hang themselves in the back room?? Are you kidding me? And for being military men, they sure were cowardly. And for being fresh out of boot camp... they sure knew an awful lot of information about this 'mist.' Were they military ingelligence? No they weren't. They were about to go on leave. They were fresh out of highschool kids.. and they knew the details of this secret military operation. And how do they deal with it? They hang themselves? Way to go. If the characters were smarter, or likable, or more significant, er.. believable... then maybe we would care when they die. The way it was, I found it hard to care about them because they seemed fake. The actors sucked too.4. The ending. OK, fine. I know it sounds good on paper... kill everyone. But really? Why not wait till the monster is right in front of you, or until you have no other option... or why not have a confrontation with the monster? Or how bout just end the movie by saying the line 'there's 4 bullets left'.. and not show it? The audience invested in these characters, then bam.. everybody's dead except for our hero and the viewer is left feeling like crap... not to mention- feeling like our hero was a total pus#y. It was really depressing, and not worth sitting through the whole spectacle of this ridiculous plot, to not have anything come out of it. - I understand wanting to do something different. And it was. It just didn't resonate at all with me. Stephen King didn't even write the ending that way. He stopped it after our hero says there's four bullets left. He left it up to the imagination. Did they make it or not? I don't know, it just seemed too easy to me to kill everyone. It was a cop-out.So, great director... just a sh#t#y movie. It happens. Steven Speilburg made AI, the Coen's made Intolerable Cruelty and Frank Darabont made The Mist. I hope he gets his groove back for Fahrenheit 451. That's all",2,3,8,20 April 2008
Lincoln," Should be Titled '13'
","So what happened? 1. The first problem with this film is the script. The writer Tony Kushner is a Pulitzer winning theater writer, but other than 'Munich' he hasn't done any motion pictures. The long drawn out dialogue between Lincoln's cabinet and the lengthy parliamentary congress sessions might play well on Broadway, but they linger on screen. It wasn't just Kushner's fault. Spielberg is one of the few directors who has final cut on anything he does, so ultimately it's yet another vast mis-judgment by the best known director and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. He's currently slated to direct Indiana Jones 5, so I guess that tells you where his judgment is. We're all waiting patiently for him to retire with some dignity, but he's just Brett Favre'n it all the way. It was a huge mistake for Dreamworks when deciding on the story, not to include Lincoln's childhood, his struggle with schooling, the severe poverty he faced growing up on the western frontier, and how he had to teach himself how to be a lawyer, family roots, his political career, and ultimately, his assassination. It's very clear from the beginning, that this film is not about Lincoln's life, but a very specific part of his presidency,(The Emancipation Proclamation). 90 minutes of this 150 minute film was spent on the 13th Amendment. So much so, that every single member of congress when voting, had their own screen time to voice that vote. It should have been called, 'Emancipation' or 'ep13', but not 'Lincoln.' Do not go into this movie expecting to learn about Abraham Lincoln's life. You will be hugely disappointed.2. There was no sense of space. No aerial shots of Washington DC in the 1860s... no city shots showing how life was back then... just interior scenes, a few battlefield scenes, and a few outdoor speeches. And this coming from one of the greatest special effects pioneers of the medium- lame.3. No secret service. The Secret Service was created by President Lincoln on April 14, 1865, the day of his assassination. Don't you think that would be an interesting thing to showcase in a movie titled 'Lincoln?' One third of the US currency in circulation was counterfeit at the time. There was no mention of it. And also, at no point did you see ANY security around the president except for a few soldiers around him in wide shots. It just made it seem even more like a filmmaker trying to tell his own pretentious tale of history instead of what really happened.4. To much cabinet delegation and congress discussion; not enough 'Lincoln.' Sure, the film made an attempt to show his affection for his son Todd, and you did see some private moments with his wife Mary, but it was all put there in a disingenuous way because the story wasn't about his family. It was hammering the 13th Amendment down our throats the whole film. Did the NAACP make this film? Lol. 5. The cast was too big. There's over 120 speaking roles in this film. 120! That's insane. Daniel Day Lewis was dazzling- his eyes just penetrated you, as usual. He projected the essence of Lincoln (at least from what legend suggests) through an indirect manner that can only be witnessed to understand. He will get the Oscar nomination for this, no question. My prediction- he will win the best actor Academy Award. Everyone else was very good, a few were great- Holbrook and Stratharin especially. Sally Field was good, but not great- and Tommy Lee was his old self- always brilliant, but never stretching beyond his usual.6. The ending. Instead of showing the horror of what happened the night of April 14, 1865, Spielberg decided to leave out the Ford Theater altogether and instead show another theater during another play, in which a man comes on stage and makes an announcement that Lincoln was shot. Then Lincoln's youngest son Todd, who happens to be attending this 'other' play, looses it. And that's it. Not only do you have to sit through 2.5 hours of boring film, but there is no pay off at the end (because we KNEW this ending was coming). To show it like they did was almost as tragic as the event itself. I'm not saying show the bullet rip through his skull, but show us the event as it unfolded- don't deny the audience of that emotion.I understand not wanting to glorify Booth. I get that. But this is history now. It happened almost 150 years ago. And Spielberg didn't think twice to show civil war soldiers being brutally murdered in the beginning of the film, why not show the murder at the end and DE-mystify it for all of us? And if his argument is that this film isn't about that, then why even show that part of his presidency at all??? Why not end the film with Lincoln still living... insinuating that his efforts and spirit still live on? This Jewish filmmaker can make a film about Oscar Schindler and show atrocities of monumental proportion... he can make a film called Saving Private Ryan and re define brutality, but he can't show the death of our most beloved President from Lincoln's perspective? - there may not have even been a holocaust if Lincoln had survived. So Steven, please don't give me the 'we can't show that' line because you showed it a hundred times in Schindler's list and you won an Oscar for it.It saddens me a great deal to write this review. I never would have dreamed that I would be giving Steven Spielberg's 'Lincoln' a 2 out of 10. My advice: Watch this film for a clinic on acting and cinematography- but wait for it on video. I might buy the DVD as a cure for insomnia.",2,349,621,21 November 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," *Sweedish version SUPERIOR to US version*
","My actual rating for this is about a 9, but I'm giving it a 10 because for some reason it only has a 7.8 on IMDb. Since IMDb is US dominated in usage, I can only guess it's because many IMDb Americans can't handle subtitled Swedish movies. This original version of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of the most compelling and realistic suspense films in existence. It is uncensored, raw, and uncut. Make sure to watch the Netflix extended edition. The Swedish cast, locations, culture and music all serve the story well. The acting is of the highest caliber you will find anywhere, and the action, sex and brutality move the tension and suspense forward in unexpected ways. If I had to categorize GWTDT, I would say it's Sherlock Holmes meets Twin Peaks, with a serial killer Psycho kind of twist, and a pinch of Hacker. But it really stands on it's own. I've never seen anything quite like it. It's refreshing, smart, sadistic, seductive, charming, and thrilling all at the same time. It really plays with your emotions. You will see some very disturbing things, but are never left without a sense of justice. There are a few things I didn't like, but the movie is so interesting and the characters are so compelling that you are completely engaged in this masterfully suspenseful and tense story.The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is just the first part of the 3-part Millennium Trilogy. The next two parts (The girl who played with fire, and The girl who kicked the hornet's nest) are compromised, a bit forced and not as natural as the first, but they are still excellent- and still have the same strong character base that made it successful in the first place. Check this out!",10,2,4,15 August 2012
Prometheus," Scott proves once and for all the ALIEN franchise will never return
","Effects amazing. Sound Amazing. Story terrible. Typical Hollywood eye and mind fock.Do not go into this movie expecting to see an ALIEN movie. Despite all the homages, and throwbacks to the original, this big budget blunder falls light years short of achieving the level of suspense, terror, progressive storytelling that the original and first sequel were oozing with.I don't want to waste my time, or yours explaining what went wrong, because this movie wasn't really a movie. I'm glad I went to the 3D IMAX version, because if it weren't for the seat rumbling sound and stunning effects, I would have walked out, or went to sleep. There was very cool set ups, and maybe 3 or 4 scenes that were incredible- but compared with the 45 or so scenes that were unmotivated, redundant and unclear, the film left way too many questions that went unanswered.I just don't understand why Sir Ridley Scott failed to see all the plot holes and subplots that meandered into nothing, and the poor character development, and motivation. A man of his stature should know better.This is a great example of what it looks like when Hollywood flexes it's production muscle without a script. It's like a band where everyone is soloing at once; with no setlist and no songs. Thanks for that, Ridley. It's not like we don't get enough of that already. This is hugely disappointing being that you're one of the few that actually can take things to the next level.",3,27,63,9 June 2012
Iron Man," Thank you :-)
","This is coming from a guy who doesn't like comic book blockbuster movies (except anything Frank Miller does), but this one is done well and is my favorite comic book film underneath all of Miller's.There are gaping plot holes that really annoyed me- and that is the reason I gave this film a 7 and not a 9. But I won't get into it here. 'no spoilers this time around.' I like it when movies (comic book fantasy or not) can make me believe in their world. Ironman didn't even come close to doing that, but the acting was superb and the dialogue was great. The comedy was surprisingly sharp and fresh. Jeff Bridges and Downey Jr. are incredible as always, and the special effects are top notch. So for those reasons, I was pretty forgiving with this one. If the plot holes were any deeper, the dam would have broke and this rating of 7 would have been a 2 or 3, but it was so entertaining that it engaged me all the way through. That's tough to do with a weak plot line. Make no mistake: Ironman has a weak plot line. I can only imagine how cool it would have been with a super strong story and well polished script. A rare thing now days, especially with giant money pig movies like this one.So here's to the Iron Man franchise- thank you for not wasting my time, and actually making a decent movie out of a multi- hundred million dollar budget. Which is more than I can say for 90% of all films costing over 150 mil to make. It could have been a lot better, but I still was very entertained.",7,1,2,27 May 2008
