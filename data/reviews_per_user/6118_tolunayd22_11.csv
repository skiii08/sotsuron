First Man," Wonderful experience!
","A very realistic experience! Camera angles, music, player performances, cinematographies were great. Incredibly realistic shot by Damien Chazelle. From Ryan Gosling's crying scene to Claire Foy's attitude, they were all very realistic. Some people may not like Neil Armstrong's account of his life, but I like it very much. Damien Chazelle tried to keep the external shots as low as possible in order not to disturb realism much, which was very successful. Perception as if you're getting into the spacecraft in your mind. I highly recommend you to watch!⭐ 100/86",8,0,0,9 October 2019
Hereditary," Oscar performance from Toni Collette!
","Toni Collette's acting was great. Shots, angles and cinematography were very good. The music is very good at stretching. If the script was a bit better, it would have been a better movie. But I'd rather have a look anyway. I can't say I'm bored, even though it's a long time. I'd say take a look if you like horror-thriller types.⭐ 100/70",7,1,5,3 May 2019
Captain Marvel," Bad origin movie!
","Overall, it's an average movie. Captain Marvel's story is beautifully told, but frankly, I did not see the power to defeat Thanos. The strongest invincible Captain Marvel, I think they haven't given him that power well. The enemy was obviously very bad, so there was no enemy in the middle, rather than bad. His scores were made by Pinar Toprak. I didn't see any good scores except for a few tracks. It could have been better scores. There were logic errors. They didn't know how Fury's eye was blind, but he lost his eye because of something so absurd and irrational. In short, I did not find the movie as origin very successful.⭐ 100/63",6,6,9,29 March 2019
The Irishman," Don't exaggerate!
","A movie with tempo problems. In some parts, editing is accelerating so much that you cannot think and feel what the script means. Looks like it's going right away and something happening. Even this is what Tony is staying at. Some parts are slow. These parts are usually the last scenes of the film. There was an unnecessary attempt to lengthen the film. Robert De Niro's particularly young CGI stands out. Believe in the quality of CGI in the war resembled a game. Other players had no such problems, but Robert De Niro's CGI was a little grin. The story has a beautiful mafia theme. Acting performances are really very successful, quality is officially flowing. Because there are legends everywhere. The quality of the shot is already good, you can tell from the director. The soundtracks is nice, and it's good to use pieces that keep up with the environment. Long story short, I think it is a successful production but I can say that a film is not very perfect.⭐ 100/85",8,5,10,3 December 2019
Suicide Squad," A fun adventure!
","It finally came that day. I watched it as soon as the movie went online. I didn't really expect it before I saw it, because it's been 2 months since I've been out and I've been trying not to buy too much spoilers. I want to tell you about this team. The American government wants to gather a team against any threat. These are the worst and most psychotic people in the world. And what happens happens after the incident in Midway City, the government begins to gather this team. Now, if you understand this part, let's come to my own views. I see I like this movie. Whether it was acting, soundtrack, Batman and Flash, they were all good details.I don't think this movie has ever been the enemy. OK Enchantress is a powerful evil, but this enemy has no depth in the story. Who's Enchantress? or his brother? who are they? They're coming out of one. Enchantress awakens his brother and ransoms the world. They have all the bad ends to conquer the world. For example: General Zod had a depth and character instinct. But here, we put a couple of enemies, bird on top of the air to make a origin. As most people say, if the enemy is not well-rendered in a movie, that movie is bad. Yes, that's the right view we've seen everywhere. For example: Avengers: Age Of Ultron, Ultron was a terrible villain. I mean, the movie didn't need an enemy anyway. For example: if the movie is a cake, add the enemy to this movie remains in the sauce. The second problem, I see the characters in the world or something always' very bad ' was touted as. When I saw the movie, I said how these guys are enemies. You're bad, okay, maybe if you're bad viewers will hate you, but a little bit of people do not leave the perception of 'villan' these characters. I say this as someone who has played the Arkham series, these characters are not like this. In the movie, Harley Quinn, Deathshot, El Diablo, always tried to add a human being. Okay, do you think these guys are Batman's enemies? I'm not sure about that. By the way, the Deadshot Batman is like this, Batman makes him Robin :)The second shortcoming of the movie is that these characters are 'bad' parts of the movie can not be transferred well. The third problem is, I'm saying it clearly and clearly. I don't like Will Smith being a Deadshot. Why? This guy already has a lot of drama movies, and when I look at this guy, I don't see him bad. How's that Deadshot? He's one of Batman's enemies in the game, but he's the angel you know here. I just felt sorry for him when he was fighting Batman, that's all! The event in one mask. It bothered me that Deadshot wore that famous mask very little. Why did you choose Will Smith? If I say he's not wearing a mask, it's a place. So he can see his face and make a profit. Well, never with me don't be angry. If they've never brought Will Smith money into this movie, then drown me here! so, I'm sure.I like Margot Robbie. I had prejudices at first, but he played really well. As for Joker, what is this guy doing in this movie? Okay, he wants to find Harley, but I'm confused by an Enchantress Joker. And they put him in the second role. The Joker and Harley relationship is not so deep and magnificent. I didn't see any depth in the relationship between them. I'm glad the film was about the universe. I'm really happy to see things like that in DC. The movie was carried by Deadshot and Harley Quinn. The soundtrack was very good. I mean, I was good at visual merits, but I don't know why the budget didn't say so much. But after all these words, I realized that there was really some improvement in DC movies. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition) you need to compare it with, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition) is better, but in caring for the characters in this movie I would say that is a very entertaining movie. I didn't notice the cut scenes as they were in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. I mean, the movie's gone. I'm looking forward to DC's upcoming films. In the meantime, I'm glad that the Extended Cut version came to Blu-ray. I recommend you to watch the movie, but know that there are mistakes in cookies and logic. enjoy the movie...⭐ 100/64",5,0,0,19 May 2019
Justice League," #ReleaseTheSnyderCut
","It's a very troubled movie. The script, the shootings and the CGIs are really bad. After Zack Snyder's withdrawal from the project, Joss Whedon sank the film. He tried to add 'Comedy' to the film both in terms of color and re-shooting. However, this film should have been much more serious. Well below expectations. This is definitely not the story Zack wants to offer. I wish we were watching Zack Snyder's version, not Joss Whedon when he first came out. But hope isn't endless?⭐ 100/54",5,2,2,13 October 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Overrated...
",A film that makes you feel like you're reading comics. The adaptation of comics is very successful. The music was used in beautiful places. I don't want to say much for the script part because it's an adaptation. It was a must-see for comic book lovers. No more.⭐ 100/74,7,2,2,9 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Epic End!
","A great superhero movie from adventure to action! I never thought it would be this good. Thanos is the best enemy I've ever seen! From the emotional scene to the epic scene, whatever I say is empty! Don't miss out on this movie! Get your ticket now! An epic end!⭐ 100/82",8,0,2,25 April 2019
Toy Story 4," New adventure!
","The adventure continues at full throttle. A new event, new characters and a new environment. A gripping continuation ring. Animation designs are impeccable. Very realistic animated film. It is a master work to continue this series without breaking. Toy Story will always be remembered like this.'To infinity...and beyond.'⭐ 100/76",7,0,0,16 November 2019
Joker," Psychologically impressive!
","Psychologically it's a really impressive experience! The development of the character Arthur Fleck's is beautifully told. I think it's a performance from Joaquin Phoenix that clearly deserves an Oscar. The music, the exterior shots, the cinematography were very successful. He also gave the film the rights to +18 to the end. You know, some movies are unnecessary +18 or, we'll watch it open,no trouble. This film is not like that. Make sure people under 18 really don't watch this movie. It can be psychologically affected, some people. I think it's nice to have the Wayne family at some point. I think it makes perfect sense that your famous scene happened that night. It's a very good production, but not too much.⭐ 100/83",8,1,4,21 December 2019
It Chapter Two," Successful sequel.
","Despite the fact that the film's duration was 2 hours and 50 minutes, I liked it and was less bored. I felt like I was reading a book while watching the story inside the movie and I liked it. The cast is extremely successful and I can give full marks to the film about the actor. What I found missing was that some scenes were too long. It's a little bad for them to postpone what they have to do and engage in other events. Since the film was R-Rated, the blood was used very successfully. Bill Skarsgård's wonderful Pennywise performance adds a distinct taste to the film. The player elections were also very successful. I can say exactly the same. Dialogues are very well written by place. The first film is better, but it's nothing less than that. It was a nice sequel. In short, it was a film that could be enjoyed. I can assure you that you will get a better experience if you watch the first movie without forgetting.⭐ 100/70",7,0,2,9 October 2019
