Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not bad but not what I had hoped.
","The Phantom Menace is a good movie. It is above average and worth the money to see I guess. Unfortunately, it does not have any of the Star Wars Magic; no cool characters, no interesting dialogue, no funny in-fighting. The special effects are as much what is wrong with the film as they are what actually makes it worth watching. The effects are so over used that the movie looses any sense of human-ness that was what made the original trilogy so special. George Lucas apparently does not trust his actors enough to let them in on any of the details while filming is actually taking place and the effect is clearly seen onscreen. The actors do not know what is going to be edited into the scenes and do not know how to react to what may or may not be there.Basically, while it is not a total waste of time, it is only of interest as background for the original trilogy. After viewing this film, I understand why Lucas started at Episode 4; Episode 1 would have been lucky to break even if it were the first movie released. Expect some boring dialogue and ok plot and a yawner of a finale and your expectations will be met.",7,0,0,14 April 2000
American Beauty," One of the best movies of all time.
","What more can be said about this excellent film. Unlike a lot of Oscar winners in recent memory, this movie actually deserved every Oscar it won. It is a riveting portrait of American life in the suburbs. Probably there are few families quite as dysfunctional as this one but I bet almost all families can relate in a small way to the Burnhams.Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening play the Burnhams, a middle aged couple who are going through their mid-life crises. Spacey is working for a magazine trying to sell advertising spots and Bening is a somewhat successful real estate agent. They are stuck in a loveless marriage and while Spacey's mid-life crisis revolves mostly around his physical appearance and sexual prowess, Bening is hungry for success and feels that she is a failure. They also have a teenage daughter who thinks her parents are crazy and has basically withdrawn from any type of relationship with them.There are so many things happenning in this film that it would be hard to explore all of them at once. Spacey's character becomes infatuated with his daughter's best friend, the daughter developes a relationship with the 'psycho' boy-next-door and Bening's character carries on a love/hate relationship with the town's truly successful Real Estate King.
What's most interesting though is that about half of the movie is way over the top while the other half is quite suttle. And it is the suttle parts that are the most interesting. The parts where you need to 'look closer' as the tagline suggests. There are not a lot of answers here but there is a lot of food for thought and American Beauty is the kind of movie you are still thinking about days later.With that said, there is one scene in the movie that seems totally out of place. It is one of the last scenes, so I can not fully describe it but it really felt out of place in this film. The scene involves Spacey and his next door neighbor. Other parts of the film were understated and they worked really well. For example, we don't really know what is wrong with Ricky's mother but she is barely conscious and her memory is shot. We do not know whether her condition is caused by being beaten or by some sort of degenerative disease but Ricky is obviously scared of ending up the same way. So when we see the hundreds of videotapes in Ricky's room and he gives the speech about beauty and never wanting to forget, we can understand the motivation for his behavior. This final scene however clashes with the style and pacing of the movie. I was impressed by the acting, the story, the style of the movie and everything else. This movie is truly a must see. If it were not for that one little scene, this movie would be a perfect 10. As it is, I had to give it a 9/10 although I would have given it a 9.5 or even 9.75 if the system allowed for it.",9,0,0,3 April 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," The Worst Sequel Ever Made
","This has got to be the worst sequel ever made. I am one of the suckers who paid $8 to see this pathetic piece of drivel in the theater. I wish I had listened to the critics who universally panned it but I mistakenly thought that Spielberg could do no wrong. Newsflash, even Spielberg will do a movie simply to cash in on a good idea and sell a few more lunch boxes and video games.The plot absolutely sucked. It was totally unimaginative and often ridiculous (T. Rex in LA? Give me a break) but what annoyed me the most was the lack of any new special effects. I mean, if you are going to throw a moronic story line at us, at least give us some cool new dinosaurs or a few good explosions. The only thing that was not recycled from the first movie was the plot and I would have enjoyed watching a total rehash of the original rather than this. And what is the deal with the second island? At the end of JP1 the dinosaurs were still alive and reproducing so why did they even introduce a second island?Not only is this the worst sequel ever made but I think it is one of the worst movies ever made. If you are one of the few people who has been lucky enough to miss this movie up until now, avoid it at all costs. You will never get those 2 hours of your life back.",1,11,40,25 June 1999
Pi," An interesting portrait of insanity.
","This movie was an incredible and intense portrait of a man balancing on the brink of insanity. It centers on Max, a mathematics and computer type who is obsessed with finding a mathematical expression for the stock market. Max has some sort of medical condition which leads him to have tremors, blackouts, and violent outbursts. He is a very private person who doesn't really enjoy personal interaction (probably because of his illness) . The only person he interacts with in a semi-normal way is his mentor and former teacher who also shares a love for numbers.There are a few problems with the script but they are all excusable. For example, at one point, there is a discussion of turning a 216 digit number into a 216 letter word but clearly that would not be possible under the circumstances. I'm probably being picky but that was a little silly considering that Max is supposed to be a mathematical genius. Plus, there are some sub-plots that never really go anywhere. The girl next door seems to like Max and he seems to go into his blackouts when she is with other men but the romance is never fully explored.These types of inconsistencies keep it from being a 10/10 film but they are actually pretty minor when compared to the rest of the film. The scenes where Max has tremors and goes into his blackouts are intense and show a man truly on the edge of sanity. His obsession with solving the 'pi' project and its effect on the frequency and intensity of his episodes is acted out and timed to perfection bringing the whole story to an mind blowing finale.This movie is more of a portrait of insanity rather than a 'thriller' but probably of interest to the same audience. Definitely worth renting.",8,0,0,17 June 1999
The Matrix," You HAVE to experience it for yourself!
","The Matrix is, quite frankly, one of the best movies ever made. It is certainly the best big-budget action movie of 1999 and possibly the best film of the entire decade (90s).      Keanu Reeves plays Neo, a mild mannered computer programmer by day, hacker genius by night. He has been consumed by finding Morpheus and uncovering the truth about the Matrix for as long as he can remember. Morpheus is the leader of a rebel force of humans who are trying to expose the truth of the Matrix and battle mega-computers who guard and protect it.      The actors do a great job with their roles, the plot is believable (at least to conspiracy theorists) and not riddled with enough holes for the Titanic to sail (or sink) through, and the special effects are incredible. When it all comes together, you have a basically flawless movie that really entertains.      So how do I describe the Matrix? To quote Morpheus, 'You have to experience it for yourself'.",10,0,0,5 November 1999
