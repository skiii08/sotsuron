10 Cloverfield Lane," Stand Alone = 5 As a Sequel = 6
","If you were to watch this movie having not seen the first movie I believe you'd judge it to be an average thriller/horror movie with a quirky ending, nothing more. Having watched the previous movie I thought it was a decent installment! It had some interesting dynamic mystery elements throughout, which was a surprise. The movie somehow managed to get me to question the motives of the detainer, even though its obvious we all know an alien invasion has taken place (if you have seen the first movie). It had a completely different feel from Cloverfield. Telling a completely different story, from a similar time-frame. However, the reason I rated it a 6 is due to the fact that the first Cloverfield was all about Sci-Fi alien ACTION! Up close and personal!! I enjoyed the suspense but only felt the film really got going until the final 15- 20 minutes, which then went on to clearly set up for another installment! I'm very happy about the possibility of another Cloverfield movie coming out in the future, and this has laid more foundations down for the next one. I hope I get to learn more about the attackers!",6,3,8,27 March 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," No depth whatsoever
","If you're a fan of pure non-stop action flickers then you'd probably enjoy this one! It only comes up to breath a few times throughout the entire movie. It is a god awful film due to the incredibly thin storyline. I had no emotional attachment to ANY of the characters, and wasn't fully clued into what was actually happening to be honest with you. To give it some credit, 90% of the stunts were genuine and the lack of CGI made the visuals, at times fairly impressive. Action junkies will enjoy the vast amount of explosions, enough there to entertain a 10 year old me for sure. Granted, I haven't seen the previous Mad Max movies and it wasn't a remake, it was following the previous storyline. But I'm guessing for at least a few of the people that haven't watched the prequel it was a bit like watching a sequel to a movie you've never seen. (Not having a clue what is happening)Overall, it was a very poor film. Easy to see why it did well in visuals, sound and wardrobe but also just as easy to see why it wasn't nominated for best picture.",4,9,16,1 March 2016
