Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," total waste...
","OK. the movie had its moments. 1 or 2 of them. I am writing this message just to save you from seeing this movie. I don't like giving bad credit for anything but this movie deserves it.The first thing is how the movie is directed. 90% of the movie is just like bad directed reality show with the camera following Borat from strange angles. Also, bad lights, make up, acting (not by Borat though)etc.Anyway, i don't want to say much. The movie might be good for you but think it twice before deciding what do you want to see (especially if your going with your girlfriend).",3,11,23,18 November 2006
