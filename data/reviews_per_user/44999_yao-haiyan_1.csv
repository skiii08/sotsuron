Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Depp's Jack Sparrow is my favorite
","I went to the Cinema to watch the 3D POTC. It's amazing though the 3D effect was not as good as I expected. But the point is that after I saw the movie I found Jack Sparrow is so charming! Then I watched all the 4 POTC movies. I didn't quite understand the 3rd and though it was so confused. But after I watched 1 and 2 I began to know that the plot is so clear. Depp really has his magic. He's different and real in every movie he stared. I like his Jack Sparrow most. In the 1st Jack Sparrow is so clever. In the 2nd he's so funny. In the 3rd one i felt that he was hidden by the writer of the movie and only appears in a few scenes. But he's always the key element in every crucial moment. Jack can seek the core of a problem and solve it perfectly. Sometime he is selfish but in his veins he is a good man. About what I feel in 4 1.In the 4th I found Jack is more kind, which is not the kindness after inner struggle as in other 3 movies. 2.He has a romance. But I agree with the opinion that there is not as much chemical as between Jack and Swan. 3.And it is more religious. That may explains the first to some extent?All in all. Johny Depp is really the best actor I've ever known in the US. And his Jack Sparrow is so clever, so lovely, so free, so funny and sometimes so philosophical, even a little bit religious in 4. I hope that later POTC movies can keep his traits and never spoil his image.",Null,0,1,22 June 2011
