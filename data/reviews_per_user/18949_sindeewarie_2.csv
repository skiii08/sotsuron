Blade Runner 2049," Amazing
","I love movies about the future. I like different ways how people see it. This is also another one. Which is simply brilliant. Loved every moment. Didn't even realize it's almost 3 hours long. The music was fantastic too. And the cast, simply amazing. If you are someone who loves mysteries, sci-fi kind, this is a must watch.",10,1,10,15 September 2019
Billy Elliot," Perfect!!
","I'm not good at writing reviews and this is my first review. So, I'll just simply say this movie is a perfect choice for movie night with your family. A simple movie with a simple story but with a deep meaning. The actors did a great job. Directing, writing everything is perfect. I loved every second of the movie. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",10,2,2,2 September 2019
