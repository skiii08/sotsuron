Remember the Titans," Black / White Harmony
","Not unlike 'Best of Enemies' and 'Just Mercy, all set amongst a back drop of Klu Klux clan and an Anti-Black culture during the 1950's to early 1970's.This film shows how Black and whites can work in harmony, and develop relationships.The is an excellent depictation of that time, and shows that Sport can most definitely bring all cultures together.Early career appearances from Ryan Gosling, and the main man form the 'Wire' make for excellent viewing.",9,0,0,28 March 2020
