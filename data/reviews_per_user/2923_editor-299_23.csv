3:10 to Yuma," Finally, a decent remake
","When the original film, '3:10 To Yuma,' (starring Glenn Ford and Van Hefflin) was released in 1957, it actually almost out-High Nooned 'High Noon.' With its allegories to U.S. patriotism and the rising paranoia over Communism, the Delmer Daves work featured the now-quaint notion of doing the right thing and standing up for what one believes - in the face of overwhelming odds, just like the Fred Zinnemann classic that won Gary Cooper his second (and most well-deserved Academy Award).Thank goodness these particular virtues were not left out of this new version, directed by James Mangold ('Cop Land,' 'Girl, Interrupted,' Walk The Line'). And while the violence level has been increased tenfold, the basic underlying message is still prominently displayed.Playing the reluctant hero (as he did in 'Batman Begins'), Dan Evans, is Christian Bale, a struggling one-legged farmer and Civil War veteran in the Arizona Territory. When he witnesses a stage robbery pulled off by Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his violent gang, he'd prefer to stay out of it, but his nature gets the better of him.Ultimately, he aids in the capture of Wade, and (for money he desperately needs) agrees to help transport him to a distant town and put him on the train to Yuma Prison. He is joined by his son, William (Logan Lerman, 'The Number 23'), Pinkerton guard, Byron McLeroy (Peter Fonda, 'Ghost Rider'), railroad official Grayson Butterfield (Dallas Roberts, 'Walk The Line')and a young doctor (Alan Tudyk, 'Knocked Up,' 'I, Robot,' 'Death At a Funeral').Wade's henchmen, however, led by the psychotic Charlie Prince (Ben Foster, '30 Days of Night,' 'Alpha Dog'), is hot on their heels. Foster is fantastic in a supporting role dripping with nonchalant evil, like Ralph Feinnes in 'Schindler's List.'After encountering renegade Apaches and a revenge-minded lawman (Emilio Estevez, 'Bobby'), the guards and prisoner arrive at the depot. Unfortunately, Wade's gang gets there shortly thereafter.When Prince offers the townspeople $200 to shoot anyone trying to take Wade to the depot, the only one who stands up for justice is the farmer. The concluding shootout is certainly loud and confusing, but is gripping and keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.Crowe is marvelous in the role, blending an almost Zen-like philosophy of Zarathustrian virtue with a violently demented killer's instinct (he callously shoots one of his own gang for a simple mistake).Meanwhile, as the tortured family man trapped in a circumstance beyond his control, Bale is wonderfully understated and nuanced here. In fact, if this was not a late summer release, I'd say either of these men could cop some award nominations, but it's too early to predict anything right now.Kudos must also be given to the camera work of Phedon Paramichael ('Walk The Line,' 'Sideways'), who brings Monument Valley and other beautiful locations to life.And while certainly not the greatest western film to appear on the silver screen, it is the best since 'Open Range,' and represents a woefully under-appreciated genre very, very well.",7,3,7,6 September 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," 'Pirates' is visually stunning, but drifts due to convoluted plot
","Based on the massive popularity of the first installment, 'Piates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl,' in 2003, it was only natural for a sequel to this Disney swashbuckler to make its way to theatres.After an adequate amount of time, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,' starring most of the last movie's original cast, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly, Jonathan Pryce, etc. has hit the big screen.And while the visuals, special effects and sets are extraordinary, the film seems to drag on searching for coherence in a meandering plot line which drifts all over the South Seas. It's not that I did not like this picture, or enjoy certain parts immensely, it's simply another case of the first one being better, as well as easier to understand.'Dead Man's Chest' picks up basically where the first left off, but Will Turner (Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Knightly) are arrested on Port Royale by Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander, 'Pride & Prejudice,' 'The Libertine'). The charge: Conspiring to aid in the escape of noted pirate, Capt. Jack Sparrow (Depp). The possible penalty: Death by hanging (the British answer to everything).Cutler gives Turner an option, however. Find Sparrow and retrieve a certain key to a certain treasure chest, and all will be forgiven. Meanwhile, Sparrow and his motley crew have beached on a remote South Pacific island (thanks to Jack's non-functioning compass) inhabited by cannibals. While the crew is imprisoned in huge, round, wooden cages suspended from high cliffs, Sparrow is treated like a demigod.After a series of goofy, but funny chases, the fun cannot last here, though, and with Turner's help, most of the men (and Jack) beat a hasty retreat from the venue. A side trip to visit what seems like a voodoo conjurer, Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris, 'A Cock & Bull Story'), sheds a little more light on things. A key such as Beckett described to Turner does indeed exist; and it opens the chest which contains the still-living heart of Davy Jones, the mythical sailor punished for all eternity for falling in love with a woman (or something to that effect).Shortly thereafter, the Black Pearl is overtaken by the ghostly Flying Dutchman, captained by none other than the squid-like Davy Jones (Bill Nighy, 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,' 'The Constant Gardner'), and manned by a doomed crew now more fish and barnacle than man. Turner is kept on board while Jack, to pay off some debt to Jones, is sent to bring 100 souls to Jones as a ransom. On this ship, Turner also meets his doomed father, 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgard, 'King Arthur,' 'Exocist: The Beginning').Jones, who keeps the key on his slimy person, also has sway over a huge sea monster, the Kraken, which can destroy a vessel and its crew in a matter of moments. The special effects in these sequences are terrific.Meanwhile, Swann has stowed away aboard another ship, and convinces the captain to put in at the pirate port of Tortuga, where Sparrow is recruiting another crew, including the disgraced former Commodore James Norrington.When she meets Jack, some sparks fly, but it's in her hands that the compass finally begins to lead the way to the 'dead man's chest.' It seems that each of the protagonists - Sparrow, Turner and Norrington - want Davy Jones' heart for themselves, and this sets off a hilarious three-way battle for the organ.As expected, Depp is great in this role (although he seems a bit more spaced-out, or intoxicated most of the time), and there are some pretty good moments here (such as the triple sword-fight on a huge rolling water mill), if one can sit through the plot complications long enough to figure out what's going on. The conclusion paves the way an obvious sequel (due for release in 2007), so that last picture may clear up some of the confusion from this one.",6,86,142,29 June 2006
Balls of Fury," Film may have 'Balls,' but not a whole lot of laughs
","In the realm of sports satire films, there's the top of the heap ('Bad News Bears'  original version, 'Slap Shot,' 'Caddyshack,' etc.) and everything else (including 'Major League,' 'Dodgeball,' 'Kicking & Screaming,' 'Taladega Nights,' 'Nacho Libre,' 'Blades of Glory,' 'Baseketball,' 'Benchwarmers' and many others).The newest poke-fun-at-athletics release, 'Balls of Fury,' easily falls into that latter category. And while there are some decent belly laughs, mostly coming from dramatic actor Christopher Walken (who won an Oscar for one of the heaviest dramas of all-time, 'The Deer Hunter'), as the androgynous, villainous Amerasian Fu Man Chu knockoff, Feng.The space usually reserved for Will Ferrell or Jack Black in a picture like this is duly filled by Tony Award-winning (in 2002 for 'The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee') actor, Dan Fogler. Sure, he's puffed up, unkempt and scruffy, but he appears to be doing a bad Jack Black 'School of Rock' impersonation (even 1980s heavy metal band Def Leppard music fills the soundtrack).With all of the charm of a stinky, unshaven Donkey Kong geek, it's very difficult to fall in love  or even root  for this character, whose name (for the record) is Randy Daytona.Uh, okay, I suppose as a professional, I have to describe a plot at this stage of the article, although I don't know what the point really is. Randy was a star table tennis player at the age of 12 in the 1988 Olympics, but an embarrassing forfeit loss to obnoxious East German Karl Wolfschtagg (Thomas Lennon, the film and TV series, 'Reno 911') made him a national laughingstock.Now, some 20 years later, he is forced to sustain himself by performing at a local run-down night club. These are some of the funniest scenes in the movie as Randy does a series of cheesy, humiliating tricks while the few patrons basically ignore the effort.Enter FBI agent Ernie Rodriquez (George Lopez, 'Shark Boy & Lava Girl,' where he played a light bulb), who persuades the chubby dork to enter a state tournament in hopes of being invited to Feng's annual ping-pong tournament. Rodriquez wants Randy to spy on Feng, who is suspected of smuggling guns, or something like that. Oh, and it seems that the evil Asian also killed Randy's Marine sergeant father (Robert Patrick, 'Walk the Line').Another chuckle moment comes when Randy is beaten by the short, goofy asthmatic Payton Oswald (King of Queens, a voice in 'Ratatouille'); but he rebounds to crush 'The Dragon,' a 10-year old girl (Na Shi La).He is trained by ancient Chinese player, Master Wong (James Hong), and his beautiful daughter, Maggie (Maggie Q, 'Live Free Or Die Hard'), and soon secures an invitation (in the form of a golden paddle).Once at the tournament, it's standard comic convention, with one-by-one elimination of the players until only Randy and Wolfschtagg are left; but in order to avoid being too conventional, there are a few twists and turns here and there.Like previously mentioned, Walken (even though he looks like he's doing a poor John Lithgow impression from 'The Mikado') carries the movie as far as it can be carried. Just appearing on the screen, he causes enough laughter to make one forget the rest of the stupidity.Almost a parody on his own career, at least Walken is not afraid to roll around in the dirt for a few cheap laughs. And, in this film, he really rolls around a lot.But, if you're looking for light (and I mean very light) summer fare, one could do worse than 'Balls of Fury.' Not MUCH worse, granted, but certainly as bad.Like 'Mr. Bean's Holiday,' for instance.",4,1,12,29 August 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," 'Pirates 3' returns to original form - sort of
","If ever a film prematurely broadcasts a sequel, it's 'Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End.' Halfway through the three-hour plus feature, one gets the distinct feeling that there will be another installment. Near the end, there is no doubt Capt. Jack Sparrow & Co. will be back for more.Especially if these movies continue to almost double their predecessor's take.Here, no expense is spared in CGI, effects, cinematography, set design and location costs. It's too bad the story is a bit muddled (certainly not as much as 'Dead Man's Chest') and the running time is too long.Other than that, part three is all about action and entertainment with a few nice twists at the conclusion. It about 40 minutes too long, but what there is of it, holds one s attention fairly well.Here's the plot - if I can synopsize it with any clarity: Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is in the Land of the Dead (the Bonneville Salt Flats) where he is doomed to haul the Black Pearl over the alabaster turf for eternity.Meanwhile, the British-sponsored East India Company (led by Lord Cutler Beckett - Thomas Hollander) has cracked down on Pirates throughout the Pacific Rim (aided by the Flying Dutchman), hanging dozens of criminals and their associates in efficient, economical multiple executions.In far off Singapore, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) and Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush, Oscar winner for 'Shine') meet with Asian pirate lord, Sao Feng (Yun Fat-Chow, 'The Replacement Killers,' 'Bulletproof Monk') to convince him and his charges to oppose the EIC. A series of firefights, however, disrupts those plans -for a while, at least.William Turner (Orlando Bloom), sent to serve on the Flying Dutchman to pay the penance for Sparrow's misdeeds, once again vows to his father, Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), to deliver him from the clutches of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy).Finally sailing 'over the edge and over again,' Barbossa, Swann and the pirates rescue Jack and begin sailing to Shipwreck Island to meet with all nine pirate lords to discuss the freeing of the Goddess Calypso (Naomie Harris), who has assumed human form.Later, in the movie's most unintentionally hilarious scene, during the climactic battle between the forces of Davy Jones, the East India Company and the pirate federation, Calypso begins to grow until she resembles a 50-foot Michael Jackson. I cannot think of anything creepier than that, friends.Some highlights include Sparrow's hallucinating conversations with himself; thousands of rocks/crabs that transport the Black Pearl through the desert; a gory hanging sequence; some typical swashbuckling and daring-do; beautiful set locations from the Bahamas to Singapore to the Antartic; and some decent acting (for this type of film).Moments of incredulity do occur, such as Lord Beckett's complete idiocy as an 18th century English sea commander, Swann's conversion into a silly Ang Lee heroine and some overdone subplots, but overall, the experience is a positive one.Critics and others who say this completes the trilogy, though, must not have watched the film as I did, since the ambiguous conclusion leaves no resolution and the last frames almost announce to the world, 'Argh! There be a sequel coming!'Also, while it may be a chore to some, try to sit through all of the credits for a small but interesting payoff.",5,20,45,21 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," A tangled web ...
","In the first of a trio of popular film part threes being released soon, Marvel Studios brings its long-awaited 'Spiderman' franchise third installment to fruition. And while it is safe to say this was a bit better than part two (in my opinion, of course)  where Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire ) constantly agonized over his lot as a super hero and struggled with his inner doubts and turmoils  it still does not approach the original in sheer fun and excitement.The filmmakers also learned about what audiences (specifically the 14-18-year-old males Hollywood seems to be in love with lately) want  action, action and more action. Here it is provided with not one, but three main villains for Spidey to take on, including a battle with himself that takes the movie on a decidedly 'Superman III' tack for a while.It's now five years from the time Peter is first bitten by that pesky radioactive arachnid in the science lab. He's still in school (is he trying to become a doctor?!), dates Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and is comfortable enough in the role of hero that he puts all self-doubts to rest. In fact, he loves the adoration given to him, so much so, he's become obsessed.Meanwhile, Harry Osborn (James Franco, given a few lead roles since 'Spiderman 2,' including 'The Great Raid' and 'Tristan & Isolde'), is still ticked off at the web-slinger for supposedly killing his old man (Willem DeFoe), Cracks develop in Peter and Mary Jane's fantasy world, as well when she is fired from a Broadway show because she cannot sing (she really can't, but wouldn't the producers and director have notice that minor flaw before the production played before an audience?).Then, while sitting together in a tree one night, a meteorite lands near them (they, of course do not see this) and a black squidlike creature emerges and attaches itself to Peter's scooter. Where this thing came from and why it goes after Parker is never explained, by the way. I guess we're just supposed to take the movie's word that it is a very important event.While all of this is going on, an escaped convict, (Thomas Haden Church, 'Sideways'), is caught is a fusion reactor thing in the middle of the desert and is turned into a sandman by the experiment. Once again, massive does of radiation does not cause tumors and painful death, it only mutates the victim into a creature more powerful and frightening than any seen before. The message from movies like this is never ever engage in any type of scientific experiment, as it only leads to mutilation and destruction, never anything good.In this case, the sand guy has the power to grow huge and rob armored cars and banks. He does it, we find out, to save his little daughter, who has an unnamed disease. Of course, Spiderman has to deal with this large angry sand dune, but Harry has also morphed into a Green Goblin-like clone on a deadly glider and is now looking for some payback, as well.Our friendly neighborhood super hero seems to have his hands full, but that's not the end of the fun. As Peter, he is also vying for a full-time job on the 'Daily Planet' (is that a subplot anyone cares about?!), and the black thing has taken over his body causing him to don a cool black costume and pull off the bad bug routine. This creature also causes him to turn into a 1970s a-hole who abuses Mary Jane and gets his newspaper rival, Eddie Brock (a blonded Topher Grace, 'In Good Company,' 'That 70s Show') fired.If those aren't enough plot confusions, Brock is soon infected by the squid and becomes  at last  Venom, a villain with roughly to same powers as the Spider dude himself. Unfortunately, we don't get to meet this intriguing character until about 15 minutes remaining in the movie.Valuable plot time is consumed dealing with the duality of Peter Parker, his love life problems and the big sand monster (which, by the way, is one of the most uninteresting bad guys since Catwoman in 'Batman Returns').One would assume that with three major villains, plus a battle with himself, 'Spiderman 3' would be three times as interesting as its predecessors. Well, one would make an 'ass' of himself assuming such things, though. With all of the loose ends flying about and the movie clocking in at just under two-and-a-half hours, this installment might rate high on the 'oooh' and 'ahhh' scale, but 'interesting' wouldn't be my choice description.Still, look for part trey to make a mint at the box office, only because we want to love these kinds of films. Plus, as the first major summer blockbuster, we are hoping against hope for that this one ushers in many more enjoyable pictures to come over the next three months - just like last year. Oops, forget I wrote that.",4,56,110,2 May 2007
Zodiac," 'Zodiac' a meticulous diary of unsolved murder mysteries
","Between 1966 and 1974, the so-called Zodiac Killer terrified residents of San Francisco (even the villain in the film Dirty Harry was a version of this individual). And while many theories abound as to the killer's identity, so far (like the Black Dahlia, Jack the Ripper and the Jimmy Hoffa case) remains unsolved to this very day. Based on the actual case files of one of the most intriguing unsolved crimes in the nation's history, 'Zodiac' is a thriller from David Fincher, who cut his teeth on the genre. As a serial killer terrifies the San Francisco Bay Area and taunts police with his ciphers and letters, investigators in four jurisdictions search for the murderer. The case will become an obsession for four men as their lives and careers are built and destroyed by the endless trail of clues.These clues include letters to the 'Los Angeles Times,' like the following, written in 1974:'Like I have always (sic) said, I am crack proof. If the Blue Meannies are ever going to catch me, they had best get off their fat asses and do something. Because the longer they fiddle and fart around, the more slaves I will collect for my afterlife. I do have to give them credit for stumbling across my Riverside activity, but they are only finding the easy ones. There are a hell of a lot more down there. The reason I'm writing to the Times is this: They don't bury me on the back pages like some of the others.'Film stars Anthony Edwards ('ER') and Mark Ruffalo ('Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' 'All the King's Men') as police inspectors trying to solve the case; while Jake Gyllenhaal ('Jarhead,' 'Brokeback Mountain') plays author Robert Graysmith, and Robert Downey, Jr. ('Chaplin,' 'A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints') is newspaper reporter Paul Avery, with whom the murderer seems to have a special connection to.At two hours and 40 minutes, one could easily be bored to distraction, but under the direction of Fincher ('Fight Club,' 'Se7en') the film moves along at a nice click. Sure, a few minutes here and there could have been shaved a bit, but for those who have followed this case, or know something about California serial killings, the deliberate and meticulous development is well worth it.And while Gyllenhaal is the big name of the cast, actually his role is very much secondary; as Ruffalo and especially Downey, Jr. stand out on all fronts. Be prepared for some shockingly realistic murder scenes, along with painstaking period detail (one of my pet peeves is to see a film that's supposed to take place in 1972 and the clothing and hairstyles are from a later date). 'Zodiac,' like the recent 'We Are Marshall' certainly does not cheat in this department.",7,5,12,28 February 2007
Blades of Glory," Ferrell hits the ice, but scores some laughs
","Will Ferrell's comedy efforts fall into two categories; he's a gentle, sweet, mousy, befuddled man-child ('Elf,' 'Bewitched' and, to a certain extent, 'Kicking & Screaming'), or he's a loud, drunken, usually half-naked idiotic lout ('Old School,' 'Anchorman,' 'Taladega Nights').His newest film, 'Blades of Glory' (a takeoff on the ripe-for-parody world of competitive figure skating), falls firmly into that second category. Ferrell plays Chazz Michael Michaels, a self-confessed sex addict ('I'm attracted to women,' he flatly states to counselor Luke Wilson), who is also skating's resident bad boy rebel. Inebriated, cocky, unshaven and wild, Chazz makes women swoon and somehow convinces enough judges that his eclectic routines are works of art. In the opening scene, he flaunts his sexuality on the ice the way John Travolta did on the dance floor (well, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit), but he does win the gold medal in a Stockholm competition. But, just in case one thinks this film is just a tankful of Ferrell gas, there's another component  the kind and gentle Jimmy MacLeroy (Jon Heder, 'Napoleon Dynamite,' 'Benchwarmers,' 'School For Scoundrels'), who was adopted by a ruthless billionaire (William Fitchner, 'Crash,' 'The Longest Yard') and turned into a skating Ivan Drago. He, too earns enough points to claim a gold medal, but when the two are on the awards stand, they begin fighting, causing former 'Knightrider' and 'St. Elsewhere' veteran, William Daniels, to strip them of their medals and ban them from competing for life. Fortunately, a weird stalker finds a loophole in the banishment  while they cannot skate individually, they may team up and compete as a pair. Thus, the premise of two males who hate each other dancing about the ice is born. Sports stations and newspapers cannot get enough, but the current pairs' darlings, brother and sister team, Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Will Arnett and SNL's Amy Poehler), have no love for these rebels of the frozen rink, while undercutting their every move. With disgraced and loopy coach, Craig T. Nelson ('Coach'), putting them through their montage workouts (including attempting to solve the potentially-fatal 'Iron Lotus'),this becomes very much like 'Dodgeball' with the world championship coming down to these two teams.And while this is certainly no sophisticated Cary Grant screwball comedy, or a classic Preston Sturges film, or even a Three Stooges laugh-fest, there are enough genuine giggles for me to give it my personal thumbs up. Most of the yucks clearly come from Ferrell's alcoholic stumblings, but Heder has a few nice scenes, too, mostly playing of his character's effeminacy. Once again, my criteria for comedies is different than my scale for drama. Here, it's the laugh factor. 'Blades of Glory' gets some cheap ones with some crude, sexual remarks and situations, but overall, fans of both Ferrell and Heder will no doubt enjoy this one.Pleasantly surprising, however, was the small but sweet performance of Jimmy's love interest, Katie Van Waldenberg (Jenna Fischer, 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin,' TV series, 'The Office'). She adds a new dimension to what could have been a throwaway role.",5,12,22,28 March 2007
We Are Marshall," A truly memorable film
","On the same day, Nov. 14, 1970, that a chartered Southern Airways Dc-9 707 jet plowed into a foothill in Huntington, West Virginia, a cyclone-driven tidal wave swept through the Bay of Bengal, killing thousands of Pakistanis.And even though only 75 aboard the jetliner perished, that story led the news for days after its occurrence. Of course, the real news was not the number of casualties on board, it was the specifics of who was lost that rainy evening.Among the 75 dead that night was most of the Marshall University football team (only four injured varsity players did not make the trip); the squad was coming home from Greenville, North Carolina, after dropping an afternoon game to the East Carolina Pirates, 17-14.Also killed were most of the club's coaching staff, including skipper Rick Tolley and Marshall Athletic Director Charles Kautz; as well as a state legislator, several Huntington city and civic leaders, six physicians and a group of prominent Marshall Thundering Herd boosters.The National Transportation & Safety Board was unable to determine the reason for the crash, although the two most likely explanations were improper use of cockpit instrument data; or an altimeter system error. Whatever the reason, the school, the town and especially the families and loved ones of those left behind had to endure a searing, white hot grief that only comes which such a sudden and tragic loss.Thirty-six years later, the pain is still intense in many areas of Huntington, and the newest Warner Bros. feature, 'We Are Marshall,' captures the mood and feeling of what it must to have been like on that memorable night of Nov. 14 so long ago.Director Joseph McGinty Nichol (better known as 'McG') does a brilliant job here, making a sports movie that transcends the game and becomes an instant classic. Fine attention is paid to period detail (just look at the DC-9 jet in the background scenes early in the picture; its the same model that actually crashed while descending into Tri-State Airport), and the enterprise smacks of amazing authenticity.Then there's the acting. In my opinion, Academy Award nominations should go to Matthew McConaughey (who plays replacement coach Jack Lengyel) for lead actor; while David Strathairn ('Good Night and Good Luck'), who plays the university president Donald Dedmon, and Anthony Mackie, as injured player Nate Ruffin, should pick up supporting nods (I know this won't happen, but it should).After the devastating crash, most people in the town (and on the university board) would prefer to suspend the program, but Ruffin and most of the students feel different. A reluctant Dedmon sides with the latter group, but faces an uphill battle when he can find neither a coach to take Tolley's place or a sympathetic NCAA willing to let freshman players start for the varsity.Enter goofy, playful Lengyel, whose slow southern drawl hides a quick and complex mind. He not only convinces assistant coach Red Dawson (Matthew Fox) to come back to the team (Dawson had given up his seat to Kautz at the last-minute and suffered survivor's guilt ever since), but he persuades Dedmon to petition the NCAA to grant Marshall an exception to the freshman rule.In a great scene, Lengyel also gets rival West Virgina coach Bobby Bowden to help the Thundering Herd learn the veer offense. 'You're good,' cracks Bowden. 'You're really good.' Still, with virtually no team, no chance to recruit quality players and the cloud of the disaster still hanging over the squad; this new group is expected to fail and only draw sympathy crowds for many seasons to come. Lengyel does his best to make sure that doesn't happen.A truly memorable motion picture with fine direction and terrific performances. One of the best pictures of 2006, by far.",8,8,11,13 December 2006
Hot Rod," 'Hot Rod': Stupid, silly, cheap and hilarious
","This silly, pointless and almost plot less production  sort of a cross between 'Napoleon Dynamite' and an episode of 'Super Dave Osborn' (despite the ultra cheap production values and ham-fisted acting)  is nonetheless one of the funniest films of the summer.Story basically has self-proclaimed stuntman, Rod Kimble (Andy Samberg, 'Saturday Night Live') attempting to better Evil Kenevil by jumping over 15 school buses. He is doing this to raise $50,000 for a heart transplant operation for his violent stepfather, Frank Powell (Ian McShane, 'Lovejoy,' 'Deadwood').This would be all well and good, however, if Rod were a legitimate daredevil. Instead, he can only afford a moped while his other jumps (over a mail truck and a local swimming pool) end in complete failure. It seems he was led to believe his real father was a real stuntman who died while testing a jump for Kenevil.It turns out, though, that his dad choked to death on a piece of pie. Thus the movie's silliness is established.As in all films like this  which blend lowbrow comedy with the raw isolation and humiliation of its protagonist  a group of goof-ball buddies revolves about for any number of reasons.In 'Hot Rod,' the doofus friends include the quasi-gay stepbrother, Kevin Powell (Sandberg's high school bud, Jorme Taconne); the semi-retarded Dave (Bill Hader, 'Superbad'); and the psychotic Rico (Danny McBride, 'The Heartbreak Kid').There's also an unrealistic love interest, Denise (Ilsa Fisher, 'Wedding Crashers,' 'The Lookout'), who leaves her rich, handsome, successful, jerk of a boyfriend, Jonathan (Will Arnett, 'Blades of Glory,' 'Grindhouse'), for the shaggy-haired nerd.This, of course, only happens in 'reel' life. In real life, girls stay with guys like Jonathan forever and losers like Rod end up eating alone at Denny's at 2 a.m.Meanwhile, despite his attempts to earn money and save his step-dad's life, Rod is constantly berated and beaten up by McShane (who gives a hilarious, deadpan comic performance), while his mother, Marie (Oscar winner Sissy Spacek, 'Coal Miner's Daughter')  a bizarro twist on June Cleaver  makes token efforts to stop the abuse.Rod wears ridiculous 1980s retro clothes, sports a tacky fake mustache and listens to songs from the hair band Europe ('Carrie,' 'The Final Countdown'); he is also dopey and lovable, representing all of use poor saps who can never reach even our most attainable goals.As Rod goes through various efforts to raise funds (he performs 'stunts' for local birthday parties and corporate functions, rents himself out as a piñata and produces an ill-fated documentary on his training techniques), he finds himself woefully short (about $50,000) of his goal.That is until he convinces a local AM radio station, run by the delusional Barry Pasternak ('SNL''s Chris Parnell) of the worthiness and stupidity of the endeavor.With laughs coming from the lowest common denominator and silly pratfall gags, Hot Rod delivers the goods. This isn't Preston Sturges or Billy Wilder, but it's funny in its own stupid, pathetic way.And after a summer of sex, violence and explosions, that's not half bad at all.",6,8,17,31 July 2007
Ratatouille," Newest Pixar film a real charmer
","The charm - and ultimately the success - of John Lassiter and Pixar Studios has been its ability to create motion pictures that are pretty much ageless in their appeal. Such films as 'Toy Story,' 'A Bug's Life,' 'Monster's Inc.,' 'Toy Story 2,' 'Finding Nemo,' 'The Incredibles' and 'Cars,' have thrilled youngsters with their brilliant, colorful animation and fun, goofy characters; while adults could savor the multi-layered story lines and familiar pop cultural references.The organization has also made a staple out of the two-hour 'cartoon' movie, something unheard of before the advent of Pixar.The newest offering, 'Ratatouille' (pronouced 'rat-a-tooie'), does not divert from that formula, telling the tale of an amazing Parisian rat, Remy (voiced by Patton Oswald, the short, nerdy actor who's made a name for himself on such TV series as 'Crank Yankers,' 'Mr. Show with Bob & David' and 'Aqua Teen Hunger Force,' among others), who cannot abide eating the same garbage day after day.Blessed with an acute sense of smell (he sniffs out rat poison for his colony) and an ultra-sensitive palette, he soon finds his way to Gusteau's Bistro, a world famous restaurant that has fallen upon hard times since a negative newspaper review by Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) caused Chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett, 'Everybody Love Raymond') to fall into a funk and die.Here, Remy runs into a poor sap of a cleaning boy, Linguini (Pat Romano), a cross between Jerry Lewis and Napoleon Dynamite. While trying to add to a soup dish one night, Linguini only succeeds in making the food unpalatable; fortunately, Remy saves the day, creates an amazing concoction and earns everyone's praise - for Linguini.The rodent is soon captured, and Linguini is ordered to kill it by the Chef (Ian Holm, 'Alien,' 'Lord of War'). He can't do it, however, and the two make an agreement - Remy will aid Linguini in the preparation of food, and the latter will take credit for it.Taking advantage of the rat's innate ability to create amazing dishes, Gustaeu's become a popular Paris hot-spot once again. This incites the jealousy of Chef, the anger of Ego and the resentment of Remy's stern pop, who tells his boy never to trust humans. To complicate things even more, while trying to keep this secret from being discovered, Linguini falls for fellow chef, Collette (Janeane Garofalo).Soon, though, complications arise, and on the very night Ego intends to visit (and write what he thinks will be another scathing review), Remy's role in the deception is uncovered, causing everyone - including Collette - to walk out of the restaurant.Will the day be saved? Will Linguini and Collette end up together? And what of Remy and his dreams? Well, you'll have to see the film. To me, this picture elevates the craft, at least as mature storytelling is concerned. This isn't the best Pixar film, but it is certainly one of the most complicated and nuanced.From the subtle and appropriate musical arrangements to the perfect vocal characterizations to the aforementioned animation (just the lush, sweeping views of Paris at night are worth the price of admission) to the complex tale. No bells and whistles here - it isn't necessary - just a sweet love story (love between friends, family and, of course, a boy and a girl). In addition, the message is no matter what someone looks like on the outside, it's the inner character that counts.It's a moral that's been told countless times, but 'Ratatouille' delivers it in a fresh, new and charming way.",7,1,4,22 June 2007
The Number 23," Carey film cannot decide its genre
","Coming off his most unfunny comedy last year ('Fun With Dick and Jane'), Jim Carey has turned to stark drama in Joel Schumacher's dark and dreary jaunt into cinematic paranoia, 'The Number 23.' Unfortunately for all involved, this picture can't decide whether it wants to be a murder mystery, a family drama or a psychological thriller. This confusion, as well as a story that meanders all over the map, leaves viewers bored, confused and generally stupefied.In fact, as a thriller, it comes in above the truly horrible 'Stay,' but far below Johnny Depp's 'Secret Window.' Carey plays Walter Sparrow, a disgruntled animal control officer who is bitten by a mongrel dog one day. This causes him to be late to meet his wife, Agatha (Virginia Madsen, 'Sideways'), which in turn allows her to browse an old bookstore and purchase a beat up tome called 'The Number 23.' When Walter reads this book, he believes it is his own life story, but cannot quite put his finger on some of the events. These scenes are accompanied by unnecessary sequences of Walter's fantasies regarding certain chapters in the book. He imagines himself to be 'Fingerling,' the lead character, a private detective who beds several women and even murders one of them.The more he reads, though, the more he slips into this paranoid world in which 23 becomes the center. The number of letters in his name add up to it, as well as other more trivial equations. Soon, he is writing these calculations on his furniture, the walls and even his body. His descent into madness and this bizarre behavior also begins to drive a wedge between Agatha and his teenage son, Robin (Logan Lerman, 'The Patriot').Here, the movie tries to become an old-fashioned murder mystery with Walter as a tough-talking gumshoe (in a series of fantasy flashbacks). In 'real' life, he goes to prison to interview a man charged with murdering a missing coed; tries to trip up the book's author (Topsy Krets) by sending 23 huge boxes of Styrofoam peanuts (yep) and even tries to dig up the woman's body in a public park. All of this leads us to a conclusion that Stevie Wonder could have seen from a mile away.Carey, who excels in comedy as well as drama (at times), is fine here, as is Madsen; but the scattergun script and lack of clear, coherent direction doom this enterprise and makes one feel that one has been through this before.And that's not a good thing.",4,2,8,22 February 2007
Shrek the Third," Once vibrant series showing signs of middle age
","Halfway through the third installment of the popular CGI franchise, 'Shrek,' one gets the distinct feeling that the end is near. What prompts these emotions? Oh, just the fact that the writers seem to have run out of ideas, funny jokes and interesting new characters.I suppose I'd feel different if I were an eight-year-old child, but ...As far as ideas go, the plot here has Harold, the frog king of Far Far Away (voice of John Cleese), dying (a hilarious segment that recalls Paul Reubens death scene in 'Buffy, The Vampire Slayer') and trusting the kingdom to either Shrek (Mike Myers in his Scottish brogue) or the monarch's wimpy nephew, Arthur (Justin Timberlake). Meanwhile, in another bit of inspired comedy, defeated 'Prince' Charming (Rupert Everett) is reduced to performing in a cheap dinner theater.This is basically where the originality ends, however. That does not mean the rest of the picture is bad - it is at least entertaining - but there's not much new any more. If 'Shrek The Third' were a person, he'd be yelling at the neighbor kids to get off his lawn and eating supper at the IHOP at 3:30 p.m.Cases in point: Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) finds out she's pregnant and, like every expectant father in TV sit-com history, Shrek is frightened by his future parental obligations; Charming enlists all of the fairy tale villains in the land to join with him, invade Far Far Away and change the outcome of nursery rhymes (sounds like the plot of the turkey from earlier this year, 'Happily N'ever After'); and the captured women of Far Far Away, Fiona, Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews), Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Snow White and Rapunzel (voiced by 'SNL' cast members Cheri Oteri, Amy Sedaris, Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph, respectively) become ninja warriors to try and save the day. Ho hum.Even the goofy antics of sidekicks Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss-In-Boots (Antonio Banderas), as well as the vocal 'talents' of Regis Philbin and Larry King (as the two ugly stepsisters), bring only smiles and smirks instead of side-splitting laughs like in the old days. In fact, the writers are forced to use the word 'poop' several times to try and please an increasingly immature and vapid film-going audience.Only 'Monty Python' alum Eric Idle (as an addled Merlin the Magician who switches Donkey and Puss' personalities) is even remotely funny and original among the new characters.After a battle featuring more windbag philosophy than daring-do, the rightful king is crowned and Fiona goes on to have a litter of baby ogres, who  like the Ewoks in 'Return of the Jedi'  look cute, but add nothing special to the production.Even the usually-clever closing credits (where the cast sings a classic song) was uninspired and listless this time around.As usual, the animation of this series is first-rate; unfortunately, the story does not match the technology and those who appreciate the combination will most likely be left feeling a bit empty inside.",5,36,50,16 May 2007
The Illusionist," Burger's 'Illusionist' confounding, yet compelling
","This independent release (Yari Films) is lovely to behold, with soft cinematography, lush landscapes and wonderful acting; all of which makes up for the average love/revenge story and a half-hearted attempt to be a latter-day 'Usual Suspects.' That being written, however, I did enjoy the viewing experience, and believe most thinking film-goers will also.Based on a short story, 'Eisenhiem, The Illusionist,' by Steven Millhauser, the movie does wrap itself around you, creating a shroud of mystery that could easily be mistaken for confusion to the casual observer.Edward Norton ('Fight Club,' 'The Italian Job') plays the title role,a gifted magician (during the reign of the Habsburgs in Austro-Hungary) who falls in love with a girl, Sophia (Jennifer Biel), many steps above him socially. When the parents force them apart, he goes off and hones his craft, traveling the world, seeking the ultimate mystery. He entertains crowds with a brilliant, but lightweight magic show, making enough money to live well, but secretly longs for his unrequited love.Later, while performing in Veinna, he sees Sophie again, although this time she's engaged to the nasty Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell, 'Tristan + Isolde,' 'The Legend Of Zorro'), who gives a new twist to 19th century domestic violence. The two lovers, despite the danger involved, continue their torrid love affair from where they left off, but Leopold's spies, including the spineless police inspector, Uhl (Paul Giamatti, 'Lady in the Water,' a voice in 'The Ant Bully'), watch her every move.When the prince murders her while in a drunken rage, Eisenheim changes his act. Instead of making doves appear or pulling rabbits out of hats, he is seemingly able to produce the spirits of departed individuals to the astonished patrons. These are genuinely creepy scenes, and much more spine-tingling than the garbage coming out films like 'Descent' or 'Pulse.' On a night in which Leopold shows up (in disguise), Eisenheim even conjures up the disembodied ghost of Sophie, who all but accuses the prince of murder.Incensed at the accusations and public ridicule they are bringing, Leopold orders the magician arrested; but when the constabulary closes in, the crafty Eisenheim has other plans, promptly disappearing before their eyes. Like the headliner's act, however, all is not what it seems. Director Neil Burger ('Interview With An Assassin') throws us a little twist, with no small thanks to Bryan Singer, but that little diversion does not ruin the film, for me at least. It's just not that much of a surprise when you think about it.Acting, especially Norton, Sewell and Giamatti, is top-notch, while even Beil (I had my doubts, just watch 'Seventh Heaven' or 'Stealth') did not disappoint. The lensing by Dick Pope ('Nicholas Nickelby,' 'Vera Drake') is exceptional and, as a period piece, it is extremely well-done with great attention paid to detail (I mean who couldn't enjoy a movie dealing with the intrigues of Austrian Emperor Franz Josef's gaggle of inbred idiotic offspring?).The best of that genre since Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux in the 1937 classic, 'Mayerling.'",7,1,2,15 August 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Better than the first one ...
","After enduring the first installment of Marvel's 'Fantastic Four,' ANY sequel would have looked good by comparison, so while I did have high hopes, I would have accepted much less.It's safe to write, however, that 'Fanastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,' is entertaining enough to be much more successful than the first installment. The movie is often dark, funny and exciting at the same time.Hey, as far as second servings go, it's no 'Empire Strikes Back,' (it's not even a 'Jaws 2'), but it keeps one in their seat for its rather short, 90-minute running time.Picking up from where the initial film left off, our intrepid quartet (the ultra flexible Reed Richards, Ioan Gruffudd; invisible force-field lady Sue Storm, Jessica Alba; human torch Johnny Storm, Chris Evans; and the rock-like monstrosity Ben Grimm, Michael Chiklis) is now used to the constant publicity extolling their exploits.Johnny is especially prone to this publicity, constantly looking to make endorsement deals and mugging before any camera he sees.The paparazzi is even ga-ga over the upcoming wedding of Reed and Sue (despite the oil-vinegar mix of the beautiful, sensual young lady and the goofy dullard), which has been in the works several times now, always falling through at the last minute.Meanwhile, a strange meteor flashes across the globe, completely freezing whatever it passes over (the Sea of Japan, the Sphinx, Los Angeles, etc.); the anomaly also creates huge craters and eventually dries up the surrounding vicinity.During the latest wedding, the phenomenon disrupts electrical and communication transmissions and causes a helicopter to crash, wrecking chairs and ruining a lot of perfectly good food. It's a literal media circus, not unlike the nuptials between Sean Penn and Madonna.Johnny Torch then follows the thing, only to discover it is the Silver Surfer (we have a title!), who is the guide for Galactus, a huge cloudy entity that absorbs and destroys planets to stay alive.Look, this premise was never really fleshed out in the film, suffice it to say the CGI looks pretty awesome here (not during the rest of the movie, though). Anyway, the Surfer pummels the Torch and escapes. His flyover also thaws out Dr. Vincent von Doom (Julian McMahon, 'Premonition') from his metallic freeze prison, which adds another villainous subplot.In addition, a group of gung-ho soldiers, led by Gen. Hagar (Andre Braugher, 'Glory,' 'Poseiden'), gets involved, as well. And, thanks to his contact with the Surfer (body by Doug Fisher, voiced by Laurence Fishburne), Torch loses control of his powers, passing them along to the other three and taking upon theirs in turn.These are the rare funny moments in this picture.Finally, Reed (who is reluctantly forced to accept von Doom's assistance) tracks down and captures the Surfer with a series of scientific devices that we - as the audience - have no business comprehending. It is only then that we discover the humanity of the character.He doesn't mean to lead the carnivorous Galactus to eat, digest and eliminate all these worlds, he's just made that way, I suppose. No one realizes this more than Sue, who tries to convince him that, somehow, helping to destroy the Earth would be a bad thing ...After a short, climatic battle, however, things just come to a rather unsatisfying conclusion. We're never really presented with the motivation behind what Galactus is or why its always so hungry for energy; or, as an all-powerful, omnipotent being, why it needs the Silver Surfer in the first place.Still, with all of its faults, its often disjointed plot line, its ambiguous ending, it still keeps you interested, and its short duration is just enough time to spend with these rather tepid superheroes.",5,5,11,15 June 2007
Transformers," Surprisingly deep despite subject matter
","The biggest surprise I received upon viewing the newest Dreamworks release, 'Transformers,' was how mature the script was, especially coming from a concept deeply rooted in Saturday morning cartoon origins.Running from 1984-87, the animated TV series competed with the likes of 'He Man, Master of the Universe' and 'Thundercats' for the macho affections of young boys growing up in that decade. Now, thanks to the efforts of producer Steven Spielberg and director Michael Bay ('The Rock,' 'Armageddon,' 'Pearl Harbor,' 'The Island'), a live-action version that combines the adventure and violence that is Bay's trademark, with some crisp writing and fairly humorous situations (thanks to screenwriters Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman, ''Legend of Zorro,' 'The Island').A little known fact amongst those not as familiar with the cartoon or comic book is that this live-action version was not the first feature film. In 1986, the animated 'Transformers: The Movie' appeared. It jumped the action forward in time 20 years to the then-future of 2005 and pitted both the Autobots and Decepticons against the menace of the giant planet-eating robot, Unicron. Well, except for joining together and the the Unicron part, this new version features pretty much the same plot. Now, though, the story is helped along with the inclusion of young stars, Shai LeBeouf ('Holes,' 'Disturbia') and Megan Fox (TV series 'Hope and Faith,' 'Two And A-Half Men') and some seasoned veterans, Jon Voight, Bernie Mac and John Tuturro, this is one (dare I say?) fairly funny and complex film.Okay, it isn't 'Hamlet,' (in fact, it's not even 'In the Line of Fire'), but it is still enjoyable and exciting at the same time. Another interesting concept is the three simultaneous plot lines, including a high school nerd, Sam Witwickey (LeBeouf) trying to impress a girl, Mikaela (Fox) and get his first automobile; an attack on a group of soldiers (led by Josh Duhamel) in Qatar by a renegade helicopter/robot; and the hacking of the United States defense computer system. In this latter story, Voight plays the Secretary of Defense John Keller, sort of a more compassionate Donald Rumsfeld.Taking the forms of cars, trucks, aircraft and even a radio (for comic relief), the Autobots, led by Prime (voice of Peter Cullen), and the Decepticons, under the rule of Megatron (Hugo Weaving, 'The Matrix,' 'Lord of the Rings'), are fighting a thousand-year conflict over a cube of ultimate power. The poor dopes on Earth are simply pawns in this galactic struggle and, more often than not, caught in the middle.Still, the humans are not entirely helpless, as the soldiers, Sam, Mikaela and even Keller (who wields a shotgun like Dick Cheney on steroids), help to battle the baddies in the streets of New York at the end.The graphics are nicely done, with the rather difficult illusion of switching from an innocent looking vehicle to a huge, deadly robotic monster appearing quite realistic. The acting gets a bit hammy now and then, but nothing like Bay's earlier efforts. And, as previously mentioned, the scribbling is clever enough to keep the older set in their seats during some of the more redundant battle sequences.Not a perfect summer movie by any means (it's extremely loud, it goes on for about 15 minutes too long and in some cases, it's difficult to tell the good automatons from the bad ones), but, overall, not bad.Not bad at all.",6,1,7,29 June 2007
World Trade Center," Stone's 'Trade center' a powerful, gut-wrenching film
","Being the cynic that I am, and having to watch two or three films per week, has left me a bit jaded at times. Try as I might to enjoy a movie for nothing more than entertainment value, and not as a project to critique, I still fall into the constant reviewer trap. honestly, it can be a bit disconcerting.That's how I felt recently when the new Oliver Stone film 'World Trade Center' appeared on my 'must see' list. Having barely lived through his last two colossal duds, 'Any Given Sunday' and 'Alexander,' and realizing the director's penchant for tweaking historical facts (see 'Born on the Fourth of July' and 'JFK'), I girded myself up for another long, boring ego trip.Fortunately (or UNfortunately, in light of the subject matter), Stone's often overbearing hand has developed a sudden deft touch here. Perhaps the topic is still too raw in the minds of Americans to mess with. Perhaps the wounds have yet to heal, and little tolerance would be given in this matter. After all, he had 30 years to think about the Kennedy assassination, but only five to put this story on film.It's the harrowing tale of two New York Port Authority officers, Sgt. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and rookie patrolman Will Jimeno (Micahel Pena, 'Million Dollar Baby,' but best known for his TV work in 'The Shield' and 'CSI') who respond to the terrorist attacks on the Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, only to become trapped themselves when the towers collapse.Caught in a dark, choking, dust-filled grave, and with one of their fellow officers, Dominick Pezzulo (Jay Hernadez) already dead, the two hold out little realistic hope for survival (even worse, neither of them knows WHY all of this happened). Each has a wife and family, however, so amidst this pocket of suffocation, they try to keep each other's spirits up. It isn't easy, though, since Jimeno is trapped under a huge concrete slab and his boss' legs are crushed.Interspersed with these claustrophobic sequences are scenes of McLoughlin's wife, Donna (Maria Bello, Oscar-nominated for 'A History of Violence' and will probably get another for this role), and Jimeno's spouse, Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal, fresh off her voice-over role in 'Monster House'). These tug at the heart even more, since the wives are as helpless as the husbands and no one seems to know if they are living or dead.On a day when close to 3,000 individuals perished and scores more were injured, the fate of two PA officers was pretty inconsequential in the big picture. But, thankfully, Stone wasn't interested in the big picture. Sure, he throws in contemporary news reports of the incident as everyone gathered around their televisions to find out what was going on, but despite the enormity of the situation, there were thousands of little stories to tell.A subplot has a former Marine Staff Sergeant, Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon, 'Bad Boys II,' 'The Woodsman'), now an accountant in Wilton, Conn., seeing the tragedy, declaring that 'we are now at war,' and leaving his place of employment. Saying that God had something for him to do, he went to church, then put on his old uniform (kept starched and pressed for some reason) and drove as fast as he could to Ground Zero. He was admitted through the barricades and proceeded to search by himself (and later with another Marine) in the dark for survivors.In the pit, John is slowly bleeding to death, but Will tries to keep him awake by talking about 'Starsky & Hutch' and asking him about his family. Will's banging of a nearby pipe is heard by the two soldiers, who alert rescue workers to their presence. But with both men getting weaker by the minute and losing more and more blood, time is now running against them.Stone boils down the cataclysm enough so that we today - with five years of hindsight - can look back at the personal horrors many people went through. Like 'United 93' from earlier this year, there's no political posturing or axes to grind. The shot of Pres. Bush speaking to the public, promising to avenge the act was greeted by a few audience member hoots, but overall ideology was pushed to the back burner so the story of two families struggling amidst the worldwide disaster could be told.A powerful, heart wrenching, emotional piece of work, one of the year's best, so far.",8,6,15,27 July 2006
Blood Diamond," Action thriller with a heart
","While the inclusion of heart throb, Leonardo DiCaprio, may attract a few teenage girls to Warners' 'Blood Diamond,' this is by no means an insignificant or shallow film. DiCaprio plays Danny Archer, a native of Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) who smuggles diamonds out of Seirra Leone (where there is a civil war) into Liberia (where there is not); from there the gems are exported to various parts of the world. These are called 'conflict' or 'blood' diamonds, because of the violent way in which they are obtained. One example of this violence is what happens to Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou, 'Amastad'), whose village is overrun by rebels. His family escapes, but he is captured and put to work in a diamond camp. There he discovers a huge gem worth a fortune. He hides it, but is spotted by a cruel militia leader; but government troops attack and keep both from the precious stone. In prison, Archer finds out about the diamond, and in exchange for tracking down Vandy's family, the men team up to go back and dig up the stone. This leads to a series of exciting escapes and brushes with both government soldiers and rebel militia, as well as an introduction to American journalist, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connolly, 'A Beautiful Mind'), who helps in many of these escapades. Meanwhile, Vandy's only son is being cruelly indoctrinated into the rebel cause and against his family; while DiCaprio is being pursued by South African soldiers of fortune, led by the Colonel (Arnold Vosloo, who played High Priest Imhotep in 'The Mummy').I don't know about year-end awards, but I would be very, very surprised if DiCaprio (whose South African accent grows on you, unlike Rob Morrow's annoying Boston drawl in 'Quiz Show') and Hounsou did not earn Academy Award nominations. There may be another few nods for Connolly, director Edward Zwick (who should have been at least nominated for 'Glory' in 1989) and maybe even best picture. The story has a heart, the action is exhilarating and the acting top notch; truly one of the best films of 2006.",8,2,5,2 December 2006
Grindhouse," 'Grindhouse': Rodriguez Si, Tarantino No!
","In this newest release, 'Grindhouse,' directors Robert Rodriguez ('Sin City') and Quentin Tarantino ('Resevior Dogs,' 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Natural Born Killers'), pay homage to cheap, B-grade 1970s films with what amounts to a double feature presentation.The effort is a hit, and a miss.Rodriguez's film, 'Planet Terror,' is a send up of those 'aliens-try-to-take over the world' cheese-fests which populated rural drive-ins during that decade. It's like 'Night of the Living Dead' meets the 'Benny Hill Show' - on acid.It's a nice homage (or parody or remake or whatever he's trying to do), however, and the bad acting, cheap sets, goofy script and poor lighting and camera work add to the nostalgic feel. The film even has scratches in the negative and missing reels for those who still do not get what's going on. It reminded me very much of the 1980's satire, 'Amazon Women on the Moon.''Planet Terror' begins on a dark night when stripper Cherry Darling (Rose McGowan, 'The Black Dahlia') quits her job and then meets an old boyfriend, tow truck driver Wray (Freddie Rodriguez, 'Poseiden,' 'Bobby'). Meanwhile, a group of soldiers, led by Bruce Willis, has released a deadly toxin into the air, causing everyone to turn into horribly-deformed zombies that look like extras from Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' video mixed with attendees at a John Merrick convention.Sub-characters include Michael Biehn ('Terminator,' 'Tombstone') as a gruff cop; Josh Brolin ('The Dead Girl') and Marley Shelton ('American Dreamz') as feuding husband-and-wife doctors; Michael Parks (TV series 'Along Came Bronson') as Sheriff Earl McGraw; and psychotic Mexican twin teenage babysitters, among others.These folks team up to fight the ever-increasing undead horde, who although have survived an almost fatal contagion, are nevertheless vulnerable to a bullet. There's plenty of those flying about, too, and the gore factor in this segment reaches 'Sin City' levels. This 'movie' is a non-stop energy rush, however, and despite the goofy situations, is quite entertaining (even though the subplot concerning the little boy is unnerving and unnecessary).Sadly, the same energy does not translate into Tarantino's work, 'Death Proof,' which tells of Stunt Man Mike (Kurt Russell) and his efforts to kill innocent young women with his car he has made so safe it's, well, death proof. He tests it out on four girls in the town of Austin, Texas, with great success; but against a quartet of others in Tennessee, things don't go as he planned.Another thing that doesn't quite work is Tarantino's abysmal - almost glacial - pacing. It's a cross between 'Faster, Pussycat, Kill, Kill' and 'My Dinner With Andre,' as he substitutes the frenzied action of the films he's trying to honor with long segments of the most banal and boring dialog ever written. Basically, it's eight of the most uninteresting women on Earth discussing men, sex, jobs, drugs and other minute details over and over again.When Kurt Russell appears a second time, I was finally thankful for the segment's only likable character. No one could have expected Tarantino to continue Rodriguez's torrid pace, but 'Death Proof' brought the entire production to a complete standstill; and not even a 10-minute car chase sequence at the end could save it. There's also no motivation as to why Russell's character wants to kill the women, but I won't quibble here.As good as 'Planet Terror' was, though, my favorite scenes in 'Grindhouse' (which is a term for those one-screen cinemas of the era in which some movies would run for months at a time) were the coming attractions. Hilarious faux films such as 'Machette' (a revenge/action/thriller with a Mexican hero), 'Werewolf Women of the SS' and slasher flicks, 'Don't' and 'Thanksgiving,' had the authentic feel of those grade-Z pictures anyone who grew up in that era paid money to see. If only Tarantino had expanded any one of these premises instead of the dull and vapid 'Death Proof,' I could have completely enjoyed the final 90-minutes of this three-hour-plus experience.",5,21,38,5 April 2007
Invincible," Good film with a terrific soundtrack
","Never underestimate the power of a good story, decent acting and a great soundtrack. That's what Disney's 'Invincible,' starring Mark Wahlberg and Greg Kinnear, brings to viewers. The studio has made some decent sports entries, including 'Remember The Titans,' and last's year's golf film, 'The Greatest game Ever Played,' so they know their stuff.'Invincible' is the biographical tale of down-on-his-luck Vince Papale (Wahlberg), who is a pretty fair street football player in Philadelphia in the mid-1970s. He is also a substitute teacher, but when he loses that gig, is forced to tend bar part-time.Meanwhile, his team, the NFL Eagles  mired in several seasons of last-place finishes (making the franchise the joke of the NFC East)  hires a new head coach, Dick Vermeil (Kinnear), who decides to hold an open tryout for players. It's looked upon as a joke, and hundreds of untalented and out-of-shape clowns show up at Veteran's Stadium for the event, even Vince (who never played college ball and is sure he is not good enough to get a second look). On a fluke, however, he is the only walk-on allowed to go to training camp.Meanwhile, he becomes sort of a neighborhood celebrity, and develops a sweet love affair with his boss' cousin, Janet (Elizabeth Banks, 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin,' the TV series, Scrubs'), a die-hard New York Giants fan.He impresses Vermeil enough to make it down to the final cut, but what happens after that, you'll have to find out yourself.Wahlberg might be a tad bit small for an NFL player (he's much smaller than the real Papale), but he is appropriately well-built; and his low-key performance gives real pathos to his character.It's Kinnear, however, who steals the picture. I must admit, when he first appears on screen, there are a few giggles; but he eases into the role of the harried skipper (whom many did not expect to last the year) and does a tremendous job.Lastly, since the story takes place in 1975 (the year my old favorite team, the St. Louis Cardinals, won the NFC East), you would expect the soundtrack to blast some high quality tunes. In this respect, the film does not disappoint. Tunes from The Who, Jim Croce, Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Canned Heat, Edgar Winter Group, Grand Funk Railroad, Rod Stewart, Elvin Bishop, Rare Earth and others, highlights this movie-going experience.A bit sappy, at times, but overall, a nice little biopic that is one of the more inspiring movies of 2006.",7,14,15,22 August 2006
The Descent," Middling thriller; better than 'The Cave'
","Basically, just an all-female version of 2005's 'The Cave,' in which a gaggle of ladies, led by the adventurous Juno (Natalie Mendoza), jaunt off to various extreme diversions and discover a world of terror beyond their imaginations.We see the group, including Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), Beth (Alex Reid), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), Samantha (MyAnna Burring) and Holly (Nora-Jane No one), in the beginning, white water rafting, before a horrible accident takes Sarah's husband and daughter away. Other than Mendoza, all of these actors are British, so I've never heard of them before. But they do a good job in their rather limited roles.A year later, Juno (who has never gone to see her 'friend' in the hospital or anywhere else), decides what they all need is a little recreation time exploring a cave in the Appalachian Mountains. Why the other women, all seemingly intelligent professionals, follow her is beyond me.Of course, this being a spelunking film, nothing can go right, and we know they will be menaced by strange, mutant-like creatures (see, once again, 'The Cave'). Things go bad right away when Juno takes them top the wrong cave; then an earthquake seals their only means of egress (that they know of). Later, they are accosted by annoying little creatures that have adapted to the dark, can crawl on the walls like flies, eat flesh and look like they could be Gollum''s backwoods cousins.The film is also very bloody. Let's me give you an example if I can. In one scene, Sarah actually fights one of the beasts in a POND of blood. With people and monsters having their bones broken, eyes gouged out, being burned, eaten, crushed, smashed, stabbed, bludgeoned, dismembered and sliced apart, this certainly earned it's 'R' rating.But despite critics and others claiming how scary it is, I just cannot agree. Yeah, it's gory all right, and sure there are some frightening moments, but these are mostly due to stuff jumping out at the characters on screen. After a dozen so of these 'innocent' occurrences (i.e. birds, bats, the other girls, etc.), when the real horror comes, you're pretty much immune.To me, it would be terrifying enough just to be trapped in a cave with no way out. That would probably make an interesting film. Why insert some make-believe 'monster' in the story? What's the point?",5,1,3,2 August 2006
The Fountain," Boring, confusing and pretentious
","There are those will call 'The Fountain' 'heart-breakingly beautiful,' or 'exceptional film-making' or 'absolutely fantastic' or even an 'outstanding sci-fi drama full of action, suspense and love.' Others will describe it as a confusing, boring, pretentious piece of claptrap that leaves one more confounded after they leave the theater than when they entered.Put me in the latter category.I wanted to like this movie, but like most other films I have had to preview this year, I came away extremely disappointed. To counter one of the above-mentioned descriptions, this picture contains neither science, nor fiction, nor suspense nor love; and it certainly does not contain one iota of action.And, from director Darren Aronofsky ('Pi,' 'Requiem for a Dream'), I expected more  a lot more.Now many smug, self-styled intellectuals  who blur confusion with artistic merit and illiteracy with charm  will chastise me as a Philistine, but I'm not THAT stupid. Call me an idiot, if you will, but I do know what a good, compelling film is. I know what intelligent, quality entertainment is (I mean, my favorite movie is 'The Bicycle Thief,' after all).'The Fountain' is not one of those motion pictures.To make my point, please allow me to describe what happens, if that's even possible. The movie begins with Hugh Jackman (better known as 'Wolverine,' playing three roles) as a conquistador trying to find the Tree of Life in South America. He's soon killed by Mayans.Next we jump to Jackman (better known as 'Wolverine') made up to look like David Carradine in 'Kung Fu,' talking to himself and making out with a dead tree inside a snow globe - which is floating through space.Finally, Jackman ('Wolverine') is a brain surgeon who tries a new cure (from a South American tree) on a baboon. Conveniently, his wife/girlfriend/lover, Rachel Weisz (Oscar winner for 'The Constant Gardner') has a brain tumor, too.It's here that the plot begins to meander like a 757 with a missing tail stabilizer. It goes back and forth from the Spanish Inquisition (nobody expected the Spanish Inquisition, and I didn't, either) to the Hare Kirshna inside the snow globe to current times and back and forth, again and again.By the way, Weisz also plays Queen Isabella, who sends the conquistador to the New World with a crazed friar to find the tree; while her modern-day alter ego has written a story called 'The Fountain,' which tells us what is going on in this movie (if that's even conceivable).Friends, the bottom line message of this film is we are all going to die. Yep, that's basically it; we are eventually all going to shuffle off this mortal coil. I needed 90 minutes of time I'll never recover to tell me something I knew way back in one of my first lives? Yes, the reincarnation theme weaves through this story, as well.Another problem self-important movies like this have is that no character speaks above a whisper, making it seem like everything they say is of the utmost importance (see 'Lake House' for the most recent example); it isn't.Even the Grand Inquisitor (Steven McHattie) speaks in low tones, preaching to tortured prisoners that 'the body is a prison for souls; and Death frees us all.' No kidding. I was praying (just like they probably were) for the sweet release of Death myself several times.Also, Academy Award winner Ellen Burstyn ('Alice Doesn't Live Here, Anymore'), is completely wasted, which is just one of many sins Aronofsky commits.Still, many will be swept up in the facade and believe they are actually seeing the best movie of all-time. One critic on the Internet Movie Data Base even gushed that 'Hugh Jackman's performance ranks among the greatest male screen performances in cinema history.' Yeah, I guess Jack Nicholson's work in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' or 'Five Easy Pieces'; Robert DeNiro's 'Raging Bull'; Marlon Brando's 'On The Waterfront'; Humphrey Bogart's 'Casablanca' Al Pacino's 'Dog Day Afternoon' and Jimmy Stewart's 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,' among many, many, many others, all come in behind Wolverine's portrayal in this movie.I suppose Aronofsky (who also wrote the story and sceenplay) had a very valid and compelling point for this film; and I'm sure he didn't mean to pull a heavy black curtain over that meaning, obscuring any relevance for the audience. It just sort of happened that way.A wonderful soundtrack (the Kronos Quartet, the rock band Mogwai and Clint Mansell) and somewhat competent cinematography (Matthew Libatique, 'Phone Booth'), does not make this a great, a near-great or even a good film.I would tell patrons to skip this one and see 'Bobby,' instead, but that movie is even worse than 'The Fountain.' Go figure.",4,7,19,18 November 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," A 'Hard' man is good to find - even 20 years later
","The basic formula for the 'Die Hard' film series is this: A seemingly invincible foe with multiple henchmen, unlimited resources and access to the latest in cutting edge technology hold a group of people or the government hostage, killing at will and demanding an unbelievable ransom  until the bad guys meet unbreakable police officer John McClane.Twenty years ago, in the summer of 1987, the world met the tough, sarcastic LAPD constable played by Bruce Willis (who became a household word as the bumbling private detective in the quirky TV series, 'Moonlighting'). With his wife among a group of hostages at the huge Nokitomi Building in Los Angeles, McClane systematically dismantled the terrorists' plans and defeated the head villain, Alan Rickman.Two inferior sequels followed suit.Flash-forward two decades to the franchise's fourth installment, 'Live Free or Die Hard.' Now a New York Police detective, McClane happens upon a geeky young computer hacker, Matthew Farrell (Justin Long, 'Accepted'), who was the target of a bombing attempt. Dragging him from the scene (as McClane does to lots of people in this role), he finds out the kid was part of a complicated computer plot with a network of other hackers  all of whom have now been blown to pieces.Meanwhile, a group of sophisticated cyber-terrorists, led by Thomas Garbriel (Timothy Olyphant, a character in such TV series as 'My Name Is Earl' and 'Deadwood'), has shut down all traffic, utility and communication networks throughout the Eastern Seaboard, causing major disruptions, financial chaos and wholesale panic in the streets.The idiot villains also make the ultimate mistake and kidnap the gruff cop's equally feisty daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, 'Grindhouse,' 'Bobby'). Now it's personal.Gathering what information he can from the rebellious Farrell, McClane figures out that Gabriel is using a 'fire sale' or a catastrophic computer meltdown to hide the fact he is trying to steal billions in money form the government treasuries. Of course, McClane is the hardware to Farrell's software  he will kill people and blow things up, while the nerd will try to foil the bad guys' plans cybernetically.It's a combination that goes together pretty well. I mean, this isn't Shakespeare, so don't expect a lot of philosophical rambling or long dialogs about art, literature or physics. It's basically Bruce Willis killing people and breaking things and then wryly commenting on what he just did.That's okay with me. I wasn't expecting to be intellectually enlightened by this experience, just entertained for a few hours; and that's what happened with 'Live Free or Die Hard.' I now look forward to the fifth version  in 2027, 'Live and Let Die Hard.'",6,3,11,27 June 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Wanna laugh out loud? See this movie
","So Ron Burgundy moves from behind the anchor desk to behind the wheel of a super-charged NASCAR automobile.Or Frank The Tank of 'Old School' gets a job racing cars. Basically it's all the same with Will Ferrell pictures. Insert the goofy, obnoxious man-child into any occupation, light the fuse, turn on the cameras and get away, he'll do the rest.And even though this movie will not have the words 'Oscar-winner' in front of it, it made me laugh  a lot; and that's what comedies are supposed to do, aren't they? The plot is pretty simple. Ricky (Ferrell) is born in the back of a Charger driven by his reckless father, Reese (Gary Cole, 'Office Space,' 'The Brady Bunch Movie'). He grows up really stupid and without his shiftless dad, but always yearns to drive fast.As an adult, he's on the pit crew of the worst team (Laughing Clown Malt Liquor) in NASCAR history. When the team's driver quits in the middle of a race, Ricky takes over and leads the team to a third-place finish.From there he is unstoppable (thanks mainly to teammate and fellow driver, Cal Naughton, Jr., played by John C. Reilly), winning race after race and picking up dozens of endorsements. Soon, he has a beautiful wife (Leslie Bibb, TV series 'Crossing Jordan' and 'Nip & Tuck'), two rude, foul-mouthed kids and lives in a mansion.He's also arrogant and continually insults his team's owner (Greg Germann, 'Friends With Money' and a regular on 'Ally McBeal'), until one day he finds himself replaced by an evil, gay, effeminate Frenchman (are there any other kind?), Jean Girard, a hilarious read by Sacha Baron Cohen (a voice in 'Madagascar'), who's married to Andy Richter, Conan O'Brien's former sidekick.While racing Girard, Bobby goes airborne and has a rollover wreck; he emerges thinking he's on fire. Later, he imagines himself as paralyzed, as well.He soon loses his wife to Cal, his home, his job and his self-respect (and is forced to deliver pizzas on a bike). Enter Reese back into his life. His father tries to get him to drive without fear (by putting an angry cougar in the front seat with him); to 'feel' the road (by making him drive with a blindfold on) and to go fast again (by taping cocaine under the car and calling the cops).Ricky is now ready for the big Talladega 500 race, but will have to contend with both Girard and his former best friend, Cal, who is now the number two driver on the circuit.Directed by Adam McKay, who helmed Ferrell's 'Anchorman,' (and worked with him on 'Saturday Night Live') and written by McKay and Ferrell, you can bet this movie is one long laugh-fest. I'd call the script crude yet crisp, meaning while it has it's stupid moments, there are a few fairly intelligent gags, a well. These include Girard drinking café and reading Albert Camus' 'The Stranger' while winning a race; and Ricky trying to explain the appeal of 'Highlander' to him.As crude as some of the other parts are, though, this is one of the funniest movies you will see this year, and gets a big recommendation from this humble scribbler.",7,5,13,31 July 2006
