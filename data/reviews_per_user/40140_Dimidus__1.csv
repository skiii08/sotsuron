The Incredible Hulk," Hulk was ready to go, but they stopped him!
","The Increbile Hulk, was in my honest opinion the most close to character movie i've seen.Once again it's another movie constantly beaten for no real reason, since it was the perfect beggining for the infinity stones saga.Edward Norton plays as Bruce Banner and did it perfectly, i have seen no actor that made this character more alive as Edward Norton did, you could both feel the compassion towards the scientist and the power of Hulk in the same movie wich is what the comics always tryed to show, both sides of is life!A movie filled with action could have more in depth when it comes to the story of Bruce Banner but Marvel decided to focus only on the action wich was not bad at all just left more content to be filled!Noneless a great movie and no matter how much i love Mark Ruffalo as the big guy, Edward Norton would have been the perfect role for all the movies in wich the green monster was in and also towards the scientist life trough out the years along side the Avengers!",7,0,0,2 April 2020
