The Blair Witch Project," Little, not yellow, different...
","I really enjoyed the film.  The fear of the unknown/fill-in-your-own-badguy-type style worked for me.  I feared a backlash from others though and I think it's because they feel they were 'fooled' into being scared.  Due to the hype, most are expecting Scream 3 or 'I know what he told me you did last summer'.  Instead they are forced to admit that they were at least on the edge of their seat during a movie with no blood, no music (scary or otherwise) and no actual bad guy.  My imagination bought it and isn't that what going to the movies is all about?",9,1,2,14 August 1999
