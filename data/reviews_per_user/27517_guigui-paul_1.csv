Ali," another great film from the Genius Michael Mann!
","A box office failure and some lukewarm reviews in 2001,but 'Ali' is in my opinion a very good and underrated film. Mann's direction is great as usual: you just have to watch and to admire the wonderful 10 first minutes and the incredible bouts scenes with Liston and Foreman to understand that Mann is one of the most stunning directors working nowadays. Emmanuel Lubezki's camera-work is also inspired and beautiful,and the overall casting is very good: Will Smith gives here an unexpected,great and complex performance,and Jon Voight,Mario Von Peebles and Jamie Foxx are also very good. The story is dense and sometimes really moving (the last half in Africa is especially successful,with the heartbreaking jogging scene and the great finale),'Ali' is a beautiful film...see it!",9,1,2,6 February 2005
