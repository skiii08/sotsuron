The Finest Hours," One of the Best Movies I Have Ever Seen
","I walked into this movie looking for a good adventure/drama and walked out believing in miracles. First, this tanker breaks in half directly in the middle of a tank causing very little damage to the water-tight bulk-head. Second, a young Coast Guardsman does the near impossible and not only gets his boat out of the harbor, but does so without losing any of his men. Third, without a compass, stars or visibility he finds the Pendleton's stern. Fourth, the tanker has ended up on a shoal making the coast guard boat the only that that has to be maneuvered around (if I understand correctly a little movie-license was taken here as the crew was actually trying to stay off the shoals). Fifth, 33 men climbed down the ladder in near impossible conditions, dropping into either the boat or water and only 1 was lost. Sixth, a boat designed to carry a crew of 4 with 12 passengers (where an experienced crewman estimated the most they could hold was 22) actually carried 36 people. And finally, without any navigational aide the massively over-loaded boat made it back into the bay and to the town's dock - without losing one person along the way. If I didn't know it was a true story I would have thought I was watching somebodies over-done imagination. But each of the above items is true and did happen. Forget the incredibly great special effects, the story alone is worth going to see.",10,13,27,9 February 2016
Dunkirk," Dunkirk - Chillingly Real
","I rarely write reviews, but had to after seeing this movie. Unlike so many other 'historical' movies there are no fictitious characters, love stories or drawn out introductions - the movies characters (whose names you barely know) simply lead you through the terrifying events as they took place.Not since the 1970 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' has there been such a good movie at showing an event in such historic accuracy without having to resort to other gimmicks. The special effects, the music and the events themselves kept me enthralled with chills often crawling up my spine.The young British soldier who so clearly just wants out, but who is also clearly no coward - carries you from the beach almost to the safely of a hospital ship (where you find yourself surprised to see female Red Cross nurses and workers) which sinks, then to another ship (this time a larger war ship) which also sinks with him now in a closed compartment that floods, back on the beach, finally in the oil filled water again to be mercifully rescued by one of the small boats from the fleet of civilian ships who arrive to help.I had long ago read of the massive fleet of fishing boats, pleasure yachts, cargo boats, ferries (basically anything that would float) that finally carried out the rescue of more than 300,000 men, but until you see them arrive from the perspective of the waiting and condemned men the story does not have the same meaning. They were salvation, not just for those men on the beach, but also for their country that needed their army to fight on.And I had always wondered where was their air cover? The movie reveals that many of their planes were held back, but that those sent over played a valiant role in making it possible for the small boat flotilla to carryout their rescue. With pilots willing to stay until it was too late to turn back, trying to stop at least one last bomber or fighter from hitting their targets.If you are looking for love stories or detailed character stories this movie is probably not for you. But if you are looking for a honest, accurate and chilling look at what really happened and you enjoy being carried through a movie by the action and music then this is the movie for you and I encourage you to see it.",10,4,11,23 July 2017
