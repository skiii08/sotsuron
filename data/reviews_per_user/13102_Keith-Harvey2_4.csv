The Blair Witch Project," Clever Clever Movie. (Warning Spoilers)
","Firstly, i waited years to see this film in high anticipation that i would be rewarded with a highly effective piece of film making that would give me sleepless nights. I saw it on a two for 1 offer in a London DVD store and bought that along with Gene Hackman starrer The Poseidon Adventure. And one of them i haven't watched since. Yes, i said good bye to gene and his friends and immersed myself in one of the most disturbing yet influential and i dare to say, immensely enjoyable films i have ever had the good fortune to watch. The end scene, in which we see Mike standing in the corner gave me the most terrible nightmares ever. I kept seeing him in my bedroom corner beneath my poster of Spiderman 2. Many people will say its the most stinking pile of tosh theyve ever seen. Maybe they should try purposely waking up at midnight and watching it in the dark, with the knowledge that you have a dripping tap 5 metres away from your room. Lord no. Now thats not to say its not without fault. I'm gonna cut my aspiring film reviewers teeth here and say that it takes a bloody long time to get to the main body of things. But for a film shot on a budget of $30,000 paired up against some crap such as Freddy Versus Jason that WAS NOT SCARY and which probably cost somewhere in the region of however million dollars and you have a man made miracle. Proof that Quantity doesn't mean quality. Long Live the blair witch and her inspiration to the 15 year old Robert Rodriguez's of the world (guilty) Scary Scary Scary s**t!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Null,0,1,26 July 2004
The Usual Suspects," The coolest film. Ever.
","This film, along with Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas is one of the coolest films ever made. I dare anyone to sit through it and not want to be a bad guy. I don't know about anyone else but i was rooting for the bad guys. They had the funniest lines and the best scenes. The Usual Suspects has kind of a film Noir feel about it, right down to the score. We see detectives in prohibition era Gangster hats which gives us the ides that maybe the roles of good and bad guys are reversed. Hats off not only to Kevin Spacey who quite frankly, was oozing with slyness throughout the film, but to Benicio Del Toro who banishes the memory of his pre Traffic James Bond Villain days as the funniest character in the film, Fenster. To tell you the plot would be to ruin a night of quality entertainment. Do yourself a favour, get this film and be prepared to be sucked into a world of deception, crime and most of all FUN FUN FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!",Null,0,2,28 July 2004
From Dusk Till Dawn," Ride Of My Life!!!
","Individually, both Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are astounding filmmakers. Films like Pulp fiction, Reservoir Dogs, El Mariachi and Desperado have shaped the lives of the many young people that have grown up with them.But put these two together and the result could have swung either way. It could have been extremely good, or on the other hand it could have been Four Rooms (shudder!!) Well let me just say that 'From Dusk till Dawn' has to be one of my favourite films in years. The reason for this? I've never seen anything more original than this movie. The first half sets itself up to be a heist movie, Resrvoir Dogs Lite if you like. Two Brothers, Seth and Jacob have robbed a bank and taken a preacher and his children hostage. Their aim? To make it across the border to Mexico where they will be safe from the police and destined for a life of luxury. They stop off at a strip bar called the Titty Twister, where they are scheduled to meet their dealer. They all sit down, relax and watch in awe as Salma Hayek entices them with a sexy dance routine involving beer and her foot. Then she turns into a VAMPIRE!!!!!!!! Well i didn't see that one coming! The next half of the movie sees George Clooney (In a role played to perfection) and the rest of the survivors fight off the fiends from hell. I haven't had so much fun with a film since Back to the Future. Its one of those films that you can endlessly quote to exhaustion. I'm tied up at the moment between 'What do you think i want you mean old b*****d' and 'Psychos do NOT explode when sunlight hits them. I don't give a f**k how crazy they are!' Both by Clooney. The film is full of touches from both directors. The trunk shot found in all of Tarantinos films has not gone amiss and the trademark Rodriguez Clutch gun is here as well. The script is brilliant and the action scenes are handled masterfully. The soundtrack is a standout with the opening theme Dark Night destined to stick in your head for ages. It just cant do no wrong. Well, i lie. Whoever cast Ernest Liu should be shot as the child has no obvious emotion. His death scene should be satisfying yet ends up being cringe inducing. But apart from that the film excels and is the perfect way to while away 90 minutes of a weekend. Rent it, buy it, tape it. Whatever you do just make sure you see this film and then spread the word around. This film Rules!!!!!!!!!!!1",10,1,2,11 January 2005
Saw," Disturbingly Brilliant. (MINOR SPOILERS.You'll probably guess them from the advert
","Okay, so the basic plot for this film is that two men wake up in a bathroom chained to a pipe. There is a dead man on the floor with a tape player in one hand and a gun in the other. Both men have a tape in their pockets which they each in turn play. The killer (Who the police have christened Jigsaw) Lets one of the men, a doctor (Cary Elwes, who contrary to popular belief is a good actor. If you read any reviews telling you otherwise see the film s closing scenes and decide for yourself) know that unless he kills the other man by six o clock his wife and child will be killed. The other poor bugger has got no real aim in the killers sick game other than to pray he's locked up with a nice guy. Heres where the film gets original. Both men have been left a hacksaw. The chains are unbreakable. The doctor has been left a bullet. The gun is just out of reach. Catch my drift? If you think I've given too much away then you're wrong. I've just told you exactly whats in the trailer but in clearer detail. This film demands a viewing by everyone with a free weekend. I went to see this film last week after months of patient waiting and it was worth ever penny. The final twist is a mindblower which you will not see coming and if you can, stick around for the end credits You'll see why. This beauty of a movie kept me up all night and i couldn't wait to spread the word that Saw is the movie for a generation. Now, about the comparisons with Seven. Seven redefined filmaking when it came out, and rightly so. It shocked audiences everywhere and got Brad Pitt a job. But it focused too much on the Law than on the victims of the killers Heinous crimes. Saw excels because it shows you more of the victims suffering than that of the efforts of the Law. But when we do see the Law it is in good taste, showing the psychological effects chasing a killer can have on the mind. Hats off to Danny Glover for shying away from the Lethal Weapon Role he is so often pigeonholed. Here there are no one liners, no humorous violence. And most of All, no happy endings. Saw has quietly stolen the crown of Best Horror/Thriller from right under sevens nose and has seiged the throne. See it. You WILL NOT be disappointed. 10/10/10/10",Null,0,0,10 October 2004
