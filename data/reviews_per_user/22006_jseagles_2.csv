One Hundred and One Dalmatians," charming and still entertaining over 50 years later, but....
","While I love the narrative flow, and the artwork of this classic Disney film, there is only middling character development, and the actions of all the human characters make no sense at all. The best scene of the movie is probably the background info of how the two human protagonists meet and fall in love by the machinations of pongo.Cruella is memorable in appearance, but in truth her character does not fit the evil cultural icon we had made her into. Her most evil aspects are goth clothing and non-stop smoking. Does she steal souls, end the world, or abuse children? no, just a run of the mill low-life stealing puppies. The plot also makes no sense at all. Cruella is so poor that she is squatting in her own family ruins, drives a barely functional car, and employs the worst two thugs in history. God knows how she pays them. according to the story line, she wants to make a puppy fur coat, because...reasons? and she is poor, so she is breaking into people's houses after carefully casing the joints to make sure they aren't home, and apparently breaks into around 100 houses? (because no one actually has 15 Dalmatians. that is mental) what is the motivation for her thugs? why not, say, just break into 1 house, steal things of actual value such as jewelry and money, and just buy a real freaking fur coat. seems way easier. and what is the end game here? she will take all the puppies to...the puppy-murdering fur coat maker? why is no one concerned about that guy? what happens to the dead skinless puppies? I mean, there are 100 of them. Just drop them off at the horse glue factory? What the heck is happening in this movie? anyways, just joking, this is a classic film your children will love, because puppies.",7,1,2,22 November 2017
Coffee and Cigarettes," great after some wine, with friends
","This movie is better than the first reviewer claims. The context of the movie is definitely social, but the humor is only superficially based on the character's real-life celebrity. True, the background music is interesting if you are a film buff. But, take my advice, watch this movies after a couple drinks, at a social gathering, to really enjoy it. The humor is better than in most full length feature comedies. I laughed loud and hard and had a lot of fun when I caught this at the university of Chicago's student movie theater. the real interest in this film is the social awkwardness created when people meet under false pretense or forced circumstance, versus the natural comfort that is obvious between longtime friends who enjoy each others company.. The gestures and facial expressions by these great actors more than make up for the weaknesses of the film. The brother/sister pairs show boredom and typical familial nit-picking. Iggy and Tom waits are brilliant. buschemi is a little misplaced in the scene where he shows up. my 2 favorite scenes, that i feel show the real genius of jarmusch, are 1.) the moment when molina's gestures have revealed that he is not, as indicated in the first review, a sycophant, but simply an honest and interested human being who is higher up in the scheme of things than the pretentious jerk he tries to befriend; and 2.)the scene where the old guy falls asleep and the camera zooms in on him for a moment, revealing a great moment of humanity.",Null,35,50,10 October 2004
