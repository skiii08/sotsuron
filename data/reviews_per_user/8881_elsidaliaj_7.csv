Blade Runner 2049," I originally rated this a 1....how stupid of me.
","I'm glad I just rewatched this movie I originally rated it a 1....The best part of the original blade runner was the 'tears in rain' monologue, which was what basically made the original a cult following.This movie was basically the essence and soul of that ending but through out it's lengthy run time. It expands upon the originals premise and universe tremendously, the grand scope of the universe and story is what the original should of been.The original unfortunately seems regular cheesy Hollywood amateurish compared to 2049, which might become the standard to compare the franchise to if you will.I can't think of any actual movie where a so called remake was better then the original or even came close to it.This somehow manages to overshadow it and become 10x grander, even somehow managing to tie in old elements, flashbacks, and even old actors flawlessly. Haven't seen this achieved anywhere else in cinematography, at least with the movies I've seen.Yes the runtime is long but it keeps you engaged, I'm glad it was long as I loved every minute of it and honestly to properly tell the story, needed it.In closing this is what the original should of been and any remakes, sequels should be compared to this.If you watched it the first time and blew it off like I did, rewatch I believe you won't be disappointed, you pick up on subtle things especially the deeper aspects, such as the main plot twist and the deep emotional burden that I totally missed the first time around.",10,3,10,7 November 2018
Gravity," Where are the Aliens?
","Seriously the whole movie I was expecting mysterious other worldly encounter but it never came based off the trailers. My mom fell asleep so she got the most out of this movie haha. This had to be the biggest joke in Cinema history I don't understand how this guy goes from children of men to this.IMDB needs to start stepping up the fake reviews it's sickening seeing this trash, and every super hero trashcan movies rated as some of the greatest movies of all time.It's literally space simulator, might as well put on a NASA training documentary.",1,3,12,2 April 2019
Divergent," Walked out on it first 20min, need I say more?
","I wish I could leave -10 for this AWFUL AWFUL MOVIE. Me and my girlfriend who enjoys all sorts of movies, I'm more picky, walked out on it in the 1st 20 minutes.It was as a 12 year old was playing director for the day. Climax music for a random walking scene, with nothing Epic going on? Check. A police force faction who acted like complete a**holes for no reason? Check. They would run everywhere for no apparent reason, act loud and make noise for no reason. Ohh here is the best part, they would climb up to the overhead subway, again for no reason, and the train would not stop at stops, it would keep going so they needed to jump into it. Wait it gets better, they end up in their headquarters where it looks worst than a run down prison, then next scene they decided to get tattoos, and they are in a swanky upscale lounge with everyone's hair done. LMFAO. That was the point we decided to get up and leave from this complete trash. If you were a fan of the Hunger Games don't get sucked into this movie it's nothing like it, it's the most childish cheesy thing you could ever possibly watch. You have been warned.",1,41,79,21 March 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 'Just Die Already' - Elaine (Seinfeld)
","The perfect reaction is Elaine when she went to watch The English Patient lol.It's literally giving anyone a pile of money Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and telling them to make a movie....The story is so juvenile, with Charles Manson randomly thrown in.... 3 hours of Leonardo DiCaprio crying....Al Pacino cameo completely forgotten, just rubbish drivel....Literally it's a showcase of the actors skills where you can write dog barf and somehow still have them perform at such a high level.",5,8,29,27 July 2019
The Dark Knight," I tried watching it 12 years later still can't.....
",One of Nolan's worst films..... Bales voice is hilarious. Ultra cheese-fest it's like a bad network television show lmao.,1,8,18,17 February 2020
Joker," Best movie in the Batman universe!
","If you're on the fence like I was thinking it was hype and almost didn't watch it, you must!Dark knight doesn't even compare and the way it's tied into the beginning of Batman is amazing!Hands down the best movie in the Batman universe ever made, hoping for more from this director.",10,3,5,6 January 2020
Life," Marsha Marsha Marsha...err...Calvin Calvin Calvin
","God one of the dumbest movie I've ever seen it's like a 5 year old made it lol. 90% of the movie is spent on commentating on what's going on like a basketball game or something, it's the most brain dead thing I've ever seen. 0 character development, and the scary killer monster is a jelly fish starfish it's actually kind of cute, he's name is Calvin. Fun fact: try to count how many times they say Calvin, I literally feel like I lost pretty much all my accumulated IQ through adulthood.Save yourself the almost 2 hour run time, sad to see Jake Gylanhal sink with this disaster. I would go deep into it but it would literally be a review of every single scene and every single line in the movie.",1,7,15,16 June 2017
