The Blair Witch Project," Creepy,Eerie,Terrifying and Original
","The Blair witch Project is a new,experimental and in my personal opinion successfully executed film. It delves into the unexplored world of simplicity and complete hand-held camera shots which is very undermined by most horrors which rely heavily on dramatic music and unnecessary jump scares to force viewers admitting they were scared by at least one scene in the movie. The Blair witch Project has no jump scares. No intense and over the top music. No ridiculous CGI monsters or ghosts. And no fancy camera quality. The film scares you to bone with a terrifying story line without even revealing the witch cursing the forest, Clever uses of environment, noises and lighting. But the most scariest thing about this film is that it can very much be mistaken as potentially real due to its theme of basic raw footage filmed from the character's perspective. Besides a few scenes in which acting is poorly executed, the movie easily scared me with its amazing build up and simple yet effective use of paranormal activity occurring around the characters particularly at night. I find it easily understandable as to why some people may find this as a bad way of creating a movie. But if your'e searching for something new and different from every other horror out there this is certainly an option.",8,1,4,5 November 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," New yet Nostalgic, Surprisingly Brilliant.
","Rogue one is a perfect addition to the Star Wars saga and is exactly what it needed. It fits perfectly in between Revenge Of The Sith and the original (A New Hope).There is only a couple of iconic characters shown, which I believe was necessary and they were not over used which gave the film great in dependency. Although Darth Vader is shown within the trailer, he is seen as much as The Joker is within Suicide Squad. The main villain called Orsen Krennic played by Ben Mendelsohn was fantastic! He portrayed a great balance of fear through anger and was clearly shown as a coward too. Also, the great amount power he is given, gives him unpredictability which leaves you constantly on edge. The heroes show concentrated amounts of courage and bravery which brings you quickly emotionally attached towards them. There acting was tremendous and a lot better than the new characters in The Force Awakens in my personal opinion. The beginning is quite slow but certainly not boring and most certainly necessary as it develops story and character thoroughly. And as gets towards the final battle it becomes extremely epic and will give big Star Wars fans Goosebumps! One thing I was disappointed by was that they did not include the infamous opening credits giving a small back story. Chirrut Imwe, a blind and wise warrior played by Donnie Yen and K-2SO voiced by Alan Tuydk were very memorable characters for there brilliant lines and their awesome fighting skills. The scenes were visually stunning and the story was very well plotted. I most definitely recommend this film to anybody even if you have never seen a single Star Wars film in your life.",9,3,6,19 December 2016
Passengers," Enjoyable yet not too special.
",Passengers is a sci-fi film about two passengers who wake up from hibernation 90 years early. The film includes large fractions of romance and action due to malfunctions aboard the ship. Chris Pratt who plays an engineer from his previous life on Earth begins the film with a great feeling of fearing being stranded that was very shocking through his tremendous acting on how he starts to lose grip of humanity. It gave a slight similarity to the film Castaway starring Tom Hanks which i thought was great. Jennifer Lawrence later appears as a higher class passenger and creates great acting chemistry with Chris Pratt. I would certainly like to see these two in another film. This film did have a fair share negativity to it such as lacking originality as it felt like a big mash up of films we've seen in the past. Some scenes seemed a little unrealistic particularly to do with the romance side yet this didn't effect the main plot in the film. Michael Sheen who played a robotic bartender was my favorite addition to this movie as he lifted humor into scenes that were becoming very dark and depressing and generally seemed to fill gaps in this movie. To conclude this i would say passengers was an enjoyable film to watch once but not again and didn't show anything ridiculously amazing.,6,1,2,28 January 2017
Suicide Squad," Wildly over hyped, nevertheless still an enjoyable movie.
","Being a very big dc fan (in particularly batman), i was immediately excited for this film the moment it was announced at comic con a while back. I was very disappointed to realize jared letos joker played a small part in the film considering he was the center of all the marketing such as trailers and posters etc. But i'm hoping the extended cut will show more of what he has to offer as i believe he has great potential. Deadshot and Harley Quinn played by Will smith and Margot Robbie stole the show in my opinion Their characters showed off their tremendous skill and craziness as well as proving even the worst villains are still very much human. The soundtrack alone for this film was brilliant but did seem quite over the top with a different famous rock song opening almost every chapter. The plot was the average superhero story you would expect but i found the special effects, scenes and actions choreography amazing, especially in imax 3d. This definitely is come back from the boring and tedious batman vs superman but doesn't live up to its ridiculous amount of hype nevertheless it was a very good film to watch and i shall be looking forward to buying the extended cut edition.",7,0,1,13 October 2016
Forrest Gump," Without doubt my favorite film
","usually when i write my reviews i do a good and bad, however there is nothing bad in this film that i can think of. Tom hanks is a outstanding actor and his character he forms is the core of this brilliant tale along side the everything else that forms this film. This film has humor, joy,love,friendship,hope,sadness, basically everything packed into one heartwarming tale. It has a strong meaning behind it all and expresses all the different aspects of life and famous events in the past. It takes a simple mind person and takes us through his extraordinary life, giving you all kinds of emotions throughout the journey. No matter how many times i watch this it will never get old.",10,1,2,6 October 2016
Split," Shyamalan makes a fantastic return!... Then 'twists' and falls
","I was very excited for this film after hearing how spectacular James Mcavoy's performance of different personality. And he certainly didn't disappoint. He did a perfect job on signifying when another person had possessed him with simply facial expression which gave a genuine creepy atmosphere to the film that was terrifying. The film consisted of many disturbing scenes that shocked me and many others in the theaters. The story was laid out with the villain go to and forth from seeing a therapist and the main plot of abducting the girls. These two parts are both smartly merged together slowly to create brilliant suspense towards the finale which left my very tensed up.The film was slow,but this wasn't negative as it was still very interesting and good movie to get your brain working around a very interesting concept. Although the finale was incredibly scary and well executed, the twist just flunked completely and didn't feel like it matched with theme of the story. The build up and the majority of the film was really enjoyable but the ending was heavily disappointing.",8,1,8,28 January 2017
Get Out," Jordan Peele's marvelous start into directing
","Get Out is creepy horror/mystery involving hints of great humor and strong message behind the terrifying plot. Daniel Kaluuya who plays the main character Chris Washington does a brilliant job in showing what the character is boldly thinking and does this with uses of thoughts out loud. Normally i would see this type of acting unprofessional, however this fitted in brilliantly with Jordan Peele's style of comedy he wanted to added smartly into the horror. The rest of the cast do a amazing job at giving that uncomfortable feeling Chris is going through. The moment they pull into the drive way of the house it immediately feels scary and that something isn't quite right.Although some scary scenes were quite predictable and had their fair share of jump scares. The originality was most definitely their and is definitely a completely out there horror we haven't seen for a while. I particularly impressed by the opening scene especially after hearing it was filmed in one take. It put viewers straight into the plot of the film and gives you a mysterious overview of the villain in the film and how it is later shown towards the end of the film. Lots of links between scenes were used to form a great use of intensity that had me trying to hide in my jumper.LilRel Howery who played Rod a very close friend to Chris completely stole the show with every scene he was included in. He uplifted the film at the perfect moments with great use of humor and had some of the best lines in the script by far. The twist was absolutely perfect and was portrayed at a great time in the movie and was surprisingly unpredictable. It also formed a good transition to start the grand finale of the filming.The film was not riddled with action and contained a large amount of slow yet interesting scenes that gave clues towards the whole mystery behind the family and house. Jordan Peele was able to enlarge the worldwide problem of racism and had almost everybody thoroughly thinking about how African Americans are still treated in certain states of America that i admittedly wasn't aware of was still occurring.Even though the film showed a unrealistic and paranormal theme. It related effectively with lots of real life scenarios.In conclusion Get Out was heavily intense, scary and enjoyable film especially considering it was Jordan Peele's first ever film directing. You can definitely tell that the plot was well thought through and i'm excited to see more films by Mr Peele down the line of the film industry. I would most certainly watch this film again and recommend it to anyone.",10,8,18,8 April 2017
Sausage Party," Completely out there comedy
","Good:Sausage party is a completely out there, extremely offensive and hilarious comedy. It takes the innocent feel of a toy story like animation in which food is brought to life. Yet is twisted with adult jokes and some forms of deep relations to real life, especially involving the stereotypical theme of continents each food originates from. The idea itself is genius and brings a new, exciting and different type of comedy we haven't seen. The type of comedy in this film is extremely offensive and doesn't hold back on bad language, sex references, stereotypical forms and utterly weird scenes that leave you thinking how on earth did they come up with that. Admittedly this film definitely wouldn't be enjoyable for everyone but for people like me into dark and over the top humor. Many scenes left me losing my breath from laughter (especially towards the end) and shocked in a brilliant way as to how they came up with such creative and unique jokes. I particularly enjoyed the small backstories as to what the supermarkets were originally like and how they were very much linked to real events such as sauerkraut (a typical German food) being portrayed as Nazis in their past reign.Bad: Although Seth rogen did a brilliant job at creating this story and hilarious jokes. For me him and many of the other voice actors were not fitting well with their characters. I felt like the larger stars such as Jonah hill were not assigned the right role for their usual style of character. I also felt as if there was very little attention added to the other hot dogs and buns closely involved with the story seeing as they were friends with the two main characters and shown being taken to the customers house to meet their fate.Aside from the comedic scenes created from the plot, i found that the story was very slow going and dragged on a while but was fortunately excelled in the big finale which was brilliantly executed.Summary: this film is worth the watch unless you are easily offended and will gather a large amount of laughs throughout the film.",7,3,6,6 October 2016
The Woman in Black," A classic story remade effectively
","In the modern time i struggle to find a genuinely terrifying and enjoyable film. This film is brilliant at creating with intense build ups and bone chilling scenes. As it follows the novel by the author Susan Hill, it gives its own twists to allow its own originality.So do not decline watching this film because you think you know what happens. CGI is used in many cases however it is not over used yet can look slightly silly in same cases. The figure of the woman was well portrayed as unknown and the pale scarred face was particularly sinister especially when it adapted into the environment of multiple scenes. The Gothic, Victorian theme gave it a constant feel of uneasiness and the atmosphere uplifted a very miserable emotion by using foggy,rainy weather and other atmospheric details. Daniel Radcliffe playing as the main character Arthur Kipps was a well developed character and showed great faces of fear and other emotions to analyse to you watching how he is feeling and also adds towards the extreme intensity of the film. At some point i do feel as if the music was slightly over the top especially to uproar jump scares.To conclude this, i believe this to be a very thrilling and scary movie which is unique in many ways. I would definitely recommend this to a horror or Gothic enthusiast.",8,1,2,26 November 2016
