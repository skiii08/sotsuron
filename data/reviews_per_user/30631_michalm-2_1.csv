Requiem for a Dream," Point of view of a Pole
","This movie is breakthrough somehow. First time a movie shows the problem of drug abuse for every rank of society that widely. The cast is very well matched in my opinion, although at first I was astonished to see Marlon Wayans in a drama. At the beginning the film rather bored me but with the time passing by, the movie aroused my interests in it. For the first look everything may seem entirely different from what we can see in Poland. Here it surely won't keep away from drugs those who know polish reality, but may help those ones who had little contact with drugs. Some of my friends parted the room before its end which means this film can emotionally affect on our psyche. I'd not recommend to watch it people who are mentally weak. It would be just easy to antagonize them. But as I said, some people will remain no convinced, like my friend who kept asking me to drink some vodka while watching it and another one who got the willingness to take heroin after he saw it. You never get to everyone. Anyway, summing it up it's very good movie that is definitely worth watching. Full note of course!",10,1,2,25 October 2005
