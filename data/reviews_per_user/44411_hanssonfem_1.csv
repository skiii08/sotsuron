Hereditary," Such a twisted nightmare
","I know this movie is polarizing. But this is truly a film that will not be everybody's cup of tea. If you go and expect a very traditional horror movie, you know with the typical ingredients, you will sit there with a big wtf bouncing around in your head. And I can see why people can hate this one. I love those more traditional horrors too.But, with that said, for those who will find this movie effective: I mean WOW. This is so haunting, so dark, so terrifying. And so fascinating. A nightmare that comes crawling, slowly. Not in the big and scary way. Toni Collette is amazing. I love her even more after this one.And the movie was even better the second time I watched it.But I just want to say it again - don't count on that this will be a ten for you as well. And don't expect a by-the-numbers horror movie. It's like if people saw Arrival and thought they where getting Independence Day. But if you watch Hereditary, I hope you'll love it as much as I do.",10,3,5,14 December 2019
