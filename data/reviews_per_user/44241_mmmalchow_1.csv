Hereditary," Incredibly disappointed
","I have never written a review before, but I really have to take a stand with this movie. I am a huge horror movie fan, not the grisly, gory slasher movie kind- but the truly thrilling, suspenseful, spine chilling, scream out loud kind. I saw the preview for this film several times before the release and had very high hopes. Then, when I saw the high IMDB score and great reviews, I could hardly wait to go see it on my birthday. I won't give any spoilers, but I'm sorry- I really disliked this movie. It started out pretty well, but kept getting more and more strange. It got so bad that for the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, I had no idea what was going on at all, There were so many unanswered questions, nothing made sense. My husband and I left when it was over, just laughing hysterically over how awful it was. Seriously. The acting was fine, Toni Collette was very good. The cinematography was excellent. It was just the writing, or plot that was terrible.",3,3,6,27 June 2018
