The Lobster," Meandering and monotone in every single aspect
","Let me preface this review by giving some attention to the truly fantastic poster art for this film. Whoever designed it did a great job. But now this poster frustrates me when I look at it. When I first saw this poster, I thought I was going to get something actually engaging, thought-provoking, a more nuanced and intellectual take on modern relationships. As it turns out, the poster is one of the only truly good parts about 'The Lobster', and yes, it has nothing to do with the movie itself. I am not familiar with or have seen the director's previous work, so I come in with no biases or particular expectations beyond the poster and that it stars Colin Farrell, an extremely competent and fluid actor who scored some great roles in the past. The film's premise is highly original and almost begging for fantastic execution in providing a succinct dark comedy. 'In a dystopian near future, single people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty-five days or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods.' This is great stuff they're working with, and this premise does indeed provide some truly good scenes in the first half of this two-hour film. Notice how I said, 'first half'. For some reason it seems the filmmakers were making this great story, a dry-witted satire about being turned into an animal if you don't find a partner in this nightmarish hotel, and they just up and said to each other, 'you know what? F*ck this, who the hell would want to see this! No, no, let's ditch this premise and make it all about boring sh*t involving people speaking in monotone to each other in the woods, doing absolutely nothing? Yeah mate, that sounds fantastic, let's f*cking do it, let's crash this movie into mumblecore monotone indie garbage with nothing interesting going on except watching some 'romance' of characters the audience has absolutely no interest in!' Screw you, filmmakers. I expected a lot more from this. I may not have expected an 'amazing' movie, or perhaps even a 'great' one, but I certainly didn't expect myself to be watching the screen with my eyes half-open wondering 'what the hell is this?' Some bits are good however, there is one particular bit in the hotel portion of the movie (the only half-decent portion) where a lady crushing on Colin Farrell says she will commit suicide if she doesn't find a partner. He doesn't reciprocate her feelings and then we are treated to a particularly gut-wrenching seen where she plops right in front of him and he just stands there looking uncomfortable and flirting with a psychopathic woman who he suddenly falls in love with. And then I find myself wondering, wait a minute, this was a good scene. Since when is Colin Farrell a psychopath or attracted to psychopaths? Why does he want to set up with a woman like this that *spoiler alert* he has a bad end with the very next night?And from then on, it only goes downhill. It doesn't help at all that every single actor in the movie is speaking in such a disgustingly uncharismatic monotone, nobody cares if this was the 'point' it makes a dreadful movie! Who wants to watch stupid, illogical unsympathetic characters who all speak to each other in a single tone of voice? You're better off giving the premise to a five year old child and telling them to draw a series of stick-figure pictures on what happens.You'll receive a more entertaining movie than this.",4,8,13,8 February 2016
The Revenant," A beautiful face with zero personality
","When going in to see the latest film 'The Revenant' from director Alejandro González Iñárritu, one cannot forgo some certain expectations that diverts your attention before the movie actually begins. You are, in the least knowledgeable scenario, aware that it stars Leonardo Dicaprio in the lead role. If you have been keeping up with cinema you know the director's name and his previous Best Picture winner, Birdman; further, if you if you have followed 'The Revenant''s production, you would hear countless stories of the troubles the crew faced shooting in sub-zero temperatures on natural locations, with all-natural lighting, and perhaps you would hear how Leonardo Dicaprio had to eat a real buffalo liver on camera. Beyond what you perceive with these expectations, the film delivers nothing of value to the audience. Yes, DiCaprio is a competent, if not a particularly great actor. Yes, Iñárritu is a talented director who knows what he is doing, and yes, DiCaprio eats a real buffalo liver on camera along with the promise of some beautiful natural scenery. And that is precisely what the film delivers. However, what the film fails to do that would ultimately capitalize upon these individual elements, is create a cohesion that ties them and drives the movie forward as the viewer is gripped in Hugh Glass' survival story. And what happens here, when the vision is separated into these three distinct elements is a really pretty, really boring movie.The plot is one of the film's more significant flaws. Iñárritu had assembled all the resources to create a singular artistic vision that would work the best outside a typical movie's generic plot conventions (for an example of this, see 'Valhalla Rising' which very effectively combines its bleak and beautiful natural scenery with a rewarding and engaging plot based in abstraction). 'Generic', however is the word that best describes 'The Revenant''s dragging plot. It's the most basic revenge story there could possibly be, and this really dampens the impact of Hugh Glass's real survival story. The sub-plot involving the Natives searching for one of their own ends up being an utterly pointless exercise that is totally isolated from the core of the movie beyond a weak convention for the ending. Furthermore, the movie is bogged down repeatedly with unnecessary flashbacks to Hugh Glass's dying wife and the evil white colonizers burning down the village. Towards the meat of the film, which is Hugh Glass's survival in the harsh winter wilderness, all these elements bear close to zero relevance.The written dialogue is fine for the most part, and provides ample characterization to make the viewer care for some of the characters. DiCaprio has little to work with, but what he has to deliver he delivers decently. Domnhall Gleeson is very good and nuanced as the Captain. Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) however, is one of the film's highlights; although he does have some cheesy typical 'villain' lines, his character is one the viewer could sympathize with. In the frontier of 'The Revenant', Fitzgerald is a man of realistic pragmatism and for the most part his actions constitute a realistic sequence of decisions that make his 'villain' role a lot more compelling than some others that flood the market. If it had been some other actor, it would have been a very different performance and most likely, a less memorable one. Tom Hardy continues to prove to be one of Hollywood's greatest chameleons in recent times as he simply melts into the role.The special effects that were used were very well-made, and did not distract; namely, the bear during one of the film's best and harrowing scenes, was an example of masterful CGI and the entire bear attack sequence was probably the best part of the movie, accentuated by Iñárritu's extended shot. It's brutal and messy, and very convincing. Beyond these instances of merit, the film is dragged down by an abundance of excessive gimmicks and cliché. The meta aspect of the filmmaking of the film supersedes the film itself a la 'Boyhood' ('It took 12 years to make!' repeats everyone associated with it). So what if DiCaprio had to eat a real buffalo liver? He doesn't have to! He's an actor! The movie defines itself with all these media headline-grabbing gimmicks of how difficult it was to create and sure, one can appreciate the effort that went in and how pretty it looks. But beyond prettiness and Tom Hardy's performance, the movie is bogged down with irrelevant subplots, a generic revenge story, and an in-cohesiveness and lack of focus that makes the whole thing boring. If you really love to observe great technical filmmaking and enjoy films that take advantage of nature, then I would recommend 'The Revenant'. If you're looking for one of the year's best films, or a compelling story of survival, skip it.",5,3,6,30 January 2016
The Witch," An Expertly Crafted 'Folk Tale'.
","It has been a considerable while since a film had elicited such a pure reaction of gut-wrenching horror from me. As a horror veteran, tired of the same generic haunted house garbage we get month after month, year after year, I am so happy to write that Robert Eggings brings us a film that transcends all expectations and clichés. The Witch is a palpable breath of fresh air for horror; or rather, a forced serving of black bile poured down your throat to churn inside your stomach and send shivers down to your soul. Even if, and I am certain of it, nothing here will be noticed by such a sanitized society like the Academy or an immature audience seeking cheap thrills, the fact remains that everything on display in The Witch is of master-class craftsmanship. The choice of 1.66 : 1 aspect ratio, a highly subtle effect, is most likely responsible for much of the film's highlights and weaves a strongly claustrophobic environment. Many of the shots are close-ups on characters' faces or characters' backs, a technique that seems to be gaining popularity as shown by last year's phenomenal Son of Saul. The camera rarely expands beyond the intimacy of our characters' personal spaces and this creates a sense of attachment and empathy wherein the viewer experiences a feeling of active participation rather than safe and casual outside observance.The gray and murky autumnal environment is succinctly rich in flavor which accentuates on the film's aesthetic of a 'folk tale'. The sky is ever overcast, and the trees in the woods are all stripped of leaves, remaining tall imposing husks that are easy to get lost in. The aesthetic and environment are almost like characters themselves in The Witch, hearkening back to Eastern European tales of the macabre, the Grimm Brothers, or Nikolai Gogol. And like a classical folk tale, subtlety is key here; you will find no obnoxious jump- scares or cheap gore here. The heavy immersion power of The Witch is pulled along by the small cast of characters who luckily, are mostly unknown. I personally recognized no one besides Kate Dickie from Game of Thrones but this was nothing distracting. It is easier to sympathize with people whose faces you aren't familiar with, rather than thinking to yourself, 'wow, Leo is doing great work here'. This holds immersion for the viewer, and because the cast was enormously talented, nothing broke that immersion or tension. The 17th century script the cast works with is written with great care and effort and remains understandable and relatable, creating no barriers between the film and the audience. There is a lot more I can comment on, but this is a spoiler-free review. For any comment in regards to story, I can say that the way the story is presented is an extremely tense family drama, punctuated by brain-searing sequences of horror. Robert Eggers, for a debut film, shows total command and mastery of the genre he presents, and plays all the cards right. The sensation of horror is crafted through just enough lingering on certain imagery, and just enough glimpses of the horrific and supernatural to make a world of difference between a competent period piece horror, and one of the most disturbing films of the 21st century.",9,5,11,12 March 2016
