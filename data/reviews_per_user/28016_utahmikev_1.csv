First Man," Finally a historical movie that actually gets the history correct!
","Wow. That's the impression at several points in this movie, though it does get unnecessarily slow at times (some may disagree). 
What can be agreed upon however is the extreme attention to historical accuracy, even down to the minute details such as the look of the cockpit instruments, use of technical terminology, exact radio transmissions, actual footage, etc. 
And while it's stunning visuals come as a secondary to the emphasis on the factual sequence of events, it does not disappoint. In an era where movie directors often rely on stylistic cinemetography to the detriment of the plot, this movie is certainly exceptional.",8,1,7,14 October 2018
