Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Unintelligent, uninspired, and unbelievable that it could be liked by so many.
","This movie is is just plain awful. I've been reading sites such as rottentomatoes.com and IMDb.com (especially IMDb) for many years, and i have yet to find anything disturbing enough to get me to actually make a comment, until now. There are many movies which seem to please a great many people that simply strike me as being, well, bad. Most people aren't very smart and don't know good writing when they see it, so how could they notice bad writing? But seriously, it seems as though people have reached an all-time low with Borat. It's genuinely depressing. Others have already pretty much captured the essence of its awfulness. I only wanted to let others know that there is at least one more person who realizes how awful this movie is. It appeals to what could only be described as degenerates.Studios have identified the lowest common denominator and are ultimately in it for the money, so it looks as though things are only going to be getting worse. One only has to look at the other movies that have come out recently to see that this is true. Case in point: Casino Royale. Easily the worst bond yet. But look at the ratings? And a movie that came out recently that is actually quite the reverse of these titles, 'stranger than fiction,' being both intelligent AND inspired, receives generally poor ratings. Proof that we are devolving.",1,48,96,26 November 2006
