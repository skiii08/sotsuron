Alien 3," Oh God... After the first two I wasn't expecting this.
","Why? Just... Why? After the first two which were some of my favorite movies, this is just disappointing. All of your favorite characters from Aliens are now dead. In the intro of the film, the ship crashes on fire and all of them die instead of Ripley. I hate it.The dog-xenomorph is actually an awesome concept, but is done in front of a green-screen so it looks suckish. My favorite part has to be the end, when Ripley throws herself in lava to rip-out the alien species.Well, AlienÂ³ isn't a bad movie, but it isn't as good as the first two.5/10. It is not bad, but it definitely falls to the mediocre genre.",5,1,4,8 January 2017
Alien," Wow...Just, wow....
","I am speechless... This is just one of the best movies ever made. Ridley Scott, you've done well... Mixing such an old, boring plot with new elements, making it better than the both of the things.Sigounery Weever is a great actor in this! She shows that gender for a protagonist really doesn't matter. The xenomorph alien looks so scary! It is one of the scariest movie monsters ever to exist in movie history! This is both a sci-fi and horror film, and perfectly balances between the two, like, I can't even, OK?10/10. There is nothing wrong with it. This movie is an absolute masterpiece.",10,2,3,8 January 2017
Aliens," Even better than the first one!
","I liked Alien so much! It is one of my all time favorite movies ever to exist! And this is even better.So Alien was a mix between horror and sci-fi, while Aliens turns the horror more into a thriller and adds the action/adventure elements to it. It greets you with an amazing cast of characters you really care for, and nothing can stop that, even if you watched the movie before.Rebecca, or Newt, is the most caring kid character in a monster movie. Usually kids in a monster movie don't work out, but here it does.Why I like Aliens more than it's source material Alien, because you saw how a single xenomorph was powerful, and now seeing an entire race of them and they're awesome queen is just amazing. If you want to see this more than Alien, you don't need to see Alien, even though Aliens is the sequel. That is why I like it.10/10. Another masterpiece that is better than the original... Classic.",10,1,1,8 January 2017
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Not as good as Jurassic Park, but it is still a good movie!
","So, if you read my review of Jurassic Park, you probably know that Jurassic Park is my second favorite movie next to Gojira. However, The Lost World: Jurassic Park doesn't deliver the same feeling of awesomeness. However, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is still a great movie! I don't care what other people say.In this movie we find out that the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park were not cloned on the same island. In this film the main protagonist is Ian Malcolm who was a side-protagonist in Jurassic Park. Here we learn more about his daily life.The whole movie was just OK, but what saved it for me is when the T-Rex came to the city and started rampaging through it.8/10. Not better than Jurassic Park, but is still great non the less...",8,11,28,8 January 2017
Jurassic World," Finally a sequel as good as Jurassic Park!
","Now, listen. Not even Spielberg knew what to do with the sequels for Jurassic Park! And this movie nailed it! The park looks just amazing! The dinosaurs are the biggest problem in my opinion. You can tell they are CGI, and the new dinosaur, the I-Rex looks bland and boring. What this movie did good is making it a direct sequel to Jurassic Park and ignoring The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. The highlight of the film is easily the fight between the T-Rex and I-Rex, and the mosasaurus and raptors jumping in the fight.9/10. Jurassic World isn't perfect, the dinosaurs look bad, but the acting is great and concept is great. This movie is amazing and I cannot wait for the sequels to come out.",8,1,3,8 January 2017
Jurassic Park," my second favorite film!
","This movie is just excellent. This came out in 1993, and the effects are better then most movies that came out today! The plot is simple. A company named In Gen found a way to clone dinosaurs and bring them back to life, and ask a few scientists to go for a tour on the island. Suddenly, the power goes off and the dinosaurs go free and start eating tourists.The plot is nothing special, but the dinosaurs, plot twists, characters are so good that the plot feels like no one could come up with it! This is my second favorite film of all time next to Gojira.10/10. There is nothing wrong with it. it is a master piece.",10,0,1,8 January 2017
