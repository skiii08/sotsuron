The New World," Nudity and History
","I've seen the previews for this film and it looks as though the native American women of the seventeenth century went around in little buckskin t-shirts, or buckskin dresses that made them resemble Wilma Flintstone. Does anyone else find this ludicrous, and more than a little infuriating. I'm not an expert on the clothing and culture of North America at the time, but I seriously doubt that the women would have been too concerned to cover their breasts. But of course American audiences are concerned to cover those breasts, regardless of how this subverts everything else that has been done by the film-makers to create a superior sense of period authenticity. I realize that some of you are going to accuse me of simply being a perv who wants to ogle womens' breasts (perv? that's a different discussion) or a nit picker who will allow a seemingly minor point to detract from his enjoyment of an otherwise excellent film by a great director. But I just had to get this off MY chest, and I was wondering what others thought.",Null,1,9,16 January 2006
