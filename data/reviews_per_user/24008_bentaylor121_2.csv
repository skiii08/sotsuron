"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," embarrassingly bad
","i should have realised that this film was going to bad just by looking at the director. David schwimmer who was good when his scripts were written for him but how he thought he could write a British comedy when he has never lived here before. Simon pegg and Dylan Moran have highly accomplished themselves as great comedians but the americanised poetic element of the film was laughable. it was obvious from the moment that we met hank azaria that he was going to turn out to be devious and how Simon pegg ended up with his ex is beyond me. the comedy was very poor and you do have to wonder how much Simon pegg really was involved in the script and the final outcome was a complete farce. the reality that the film is supposed to mirror i.e. running the marathon and the troubles of this was also completely trivial. how Simon pegg was able to walk those last 9 miles in about 5 mph while it was still dark and I'm not sure when i was supposed to laugh as its very poorly written with a small poetic plot. David schwimmer should maybe go back to the drawing board before dragging down his, Simon pegg's and Dylan Moran's name.",3,1,6,9 March 2008
Juno," Whats all the fuss about
","Im not saying this is a bad film, however how it deserves the title of one of the greatest films of 2007 is beyond me. the plot is very poor and follows another film involving pregnancy in knocked up. whereas knocked up deals with both emotions felt by the man and the woman with an unexpected pregnancy, Juno's character was the main focus of the film with the other roles being quite minimal in contrast. the comedy element is also lacking especially for a film as short as this. apart from childish quotes from Juno herself the comedy element is in short bursts and is not fluent throughout the film, and the emotional aspect isn't really touched upon either. there is no way this film deserves to be classified as better than other comedy/emotional of 2007 and how it gained all this critical acclaim is a question i keep on asking myself.",6,2,7,7 February 2008
