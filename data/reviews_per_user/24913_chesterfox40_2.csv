Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Best comedy movie of 2006
","I've seen quiet a few comedy movies this year, but Borat is definitely the greatest one.Borat is a fictional reporter from Kazachstan who makes a documentary about the 'US and A'. He goes there with his producer Azamat Bagatov. Borat wants to learn about the American ways. Borat try's to learn the American ways on his trip by taking interviews and meeting with all kinds of people(a group of feminists, a humor coach, a driving instructor, a car dealer and much more). These interviews are hilarious, you will not be able to stop laughing. He also makes a stop at a rodeo show to sing the national anthem(you can imagine what that results in). There is also a scene where Borat and his producer fight in their hotel while they are completely naked that will go down in comedy history.Borat is extremely politically incorrect, racist, macho, antisemitic and FUNNY AS HELL.I give this movie a 10 and recommend everybody to go and see this movie.",10,2,17,7 November 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Nice but the book was better
","At the film festival in Cannes the critics destroyed this movie. I personally think that they are wrong. The Da Vinci Code movie is not as good as I expected but its quiet nice. I read the book a few months before the movie came in theaters and was truly amazed. The book was very exciting, filled with action and suspense. So of course I could not wait for the movie to come out. I went to see the movie in its opening weekend at my local movie theater. The movie turned out to be a nice action/thriller but was not as exciting as the book. The book explained every detail and the movie rushed through all the facts. Those facts are quiet important to understand the whole story. The Da Vinci Code has got a magnificent cast. Tom Hanks really looks like what I imagined of Robert Langdon and Ian McKellen does a great job as Sir Leigh Teabing.I recommend everybody to see this movie.My rating: 8/10",8,1,2,8 November 2006
