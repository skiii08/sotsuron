The Ring," Vaguely interesting horror premise, but script flops badly.
","`The Ring' is an eerie supernatural thriller that is just in time for Halloween. It raises a scary barrage of questions that had me on the edge of my seat through most of the movie. The ending floored me -- but not in a good way. This is another one of those films that takes your expectations to the heights and then drops you with a sudden thud at the end. In the final analysis, the movie never explains nearly enough to satisfy. It doesn't even try. I am weary of movies without an adequate conclusion. What's left, after the credits roll, is an audience that feels cheated.",3,0,0,16 October 2002
Hotel Rwanda," 'Hotel Rwanda' is not a vacation destination...
","In fact, just seeing the movie 'Hotel Rwanda' will likely be one of the most stressful experiences you will have at the movies this new year. The movie chronicles heroic events that took place in 1994 in the midst of the horrors of attempted genocide. The hero of the movie, and of the actual events, is Paul Rusesabagina, played impressively by Don Cheadle. Paul is a manager at an upscale, Sabena-owned hotel who risks everything to save the lives of more than one thousand Tutsis. This is the group that was being butchered by the Hutu militia. It is estimated that a million or more Tutsis were killed in just a few months' time.Prior to the outbreak of violence, we find Paul performing his regular duties as hotel manager. He gifts liberally to suppliers and military and others in power in order to guarantee that the hotel will be able to continue to fully serve its guests in the current climate. He also wants to know that he has friends in high places who will protect him and his family if trouble comes.When the killing starts, Paul quickly learns that those he has cultivated in high places are not as dependable as he hoped. He and his family are in great danger after all. In addition, frightened friends and relatives turn to him for help. He initially resists but then allows them into the hotel while he uses all available resources to bargain with those that would do harm or would allow harm to be done. Soon orphans and others in fear for their lives come to his hotel for safety. Paul fights to save all those under his protection using every device he can imagine.This obviously sounds like this year's 'Schindler's List'. However it is a much more difficult film to watch and it has some flaws. Initially, the film lacks sufficient exposition about the reasons for the warfare between the Hutus and Tutsis. There is a bit said about the origin of this class distinction in Rwanda and what it has led to. However, it was not nearly enough to keep us from wondering if we really understand the differences between the good guys and the bad guys. By the end of the movie, you'll probably figure it out, but that's a little late.No question about the horrors that took place -- but this film forces us to endure cycle after cycle of promised escape that is undone by new violence. It is a bit too repetitive and hard to take. The film certainly does succeed in sharing with us the terrible atrocities that were committed in Rwanda. See this 'Hotel Rwanda' -- but steel yourself for the experience. For its successes and for the many fine performances, I rate it a B+.",9,0,0,4 January 2005
Meet the Fockers," We've Been 'Focker-ized'!
","'Meet the Fockers' sounds like 'Meet the f-u-u-'. Oops! Can't say that because of FCC guidelines. Just the same, the title pretty much describes the level of the humor in this Ben Stiller comedy. But that's redundant because it IS a Ben Stiller movie. Clearly my expectations for this movie were not high and, maybe because of that, I found 'Meet the Fockers' quite funny.Don't get me wrong. This is not a movie for everyone. First off, the writers did not miss a single opportunity to play off of the name 'Focker'. It's silly and gets a little old but it somehow works with the other repetitious low-down gags.Focker is the family name for Greg (Focker), Ben Stiller. The funniest Fockers, however, (now I'm doing it) are Greg's parents Bernie and Roz, a loose and liberal Florida hippy couple still living in the last century and enjoying every minute of it. Dustin Hoffman, as Bernie displays a previously unrevealed talent for over the top comedy. Fitting perfectly with Hoffman's Bernie, is Barbra Streisand as Roz Focker, reminiscent of the 'zaftig' Lainie Kazan. Bernie is a yesteryear lawyer who has not practiced since who knows when. Roz is the main breadwinner from her business as a sex therapist to the elderly.Greg is not too eager to reveal his parents' true nature to his fiancée's parents as they all come to visit to get to know one another better. Teri Polo nicely plays Greg's fiancée Pam. Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner play her stiff and straight parents, Jack and Dina Byrnes. Oh  also add in some baby low-brow by Spencer and Bradley Pickeren, two adorable twins playing Little Jack.So, go low, go loose -- or don't go at all -- but if you like Ben Stiller, go see 'Meet the Fockers'. Dustin's antics will crack you up and you'll enjoy Barbra back on the big screen after so long. Rated a B+.",9,168,257,20 December 2004
Ray," Hoo-RAY! Jaime Foxx is excellent in this bio-pic!
","We previewed the film 'Ray' last night in Portland, Oregon, where a packed audience applauded spontaneously at the end. You will believe that Jaimie Foxx IS Ray Charles in this movie. His performance so astonishes that I forgot this is an actor in the role who is lip-syncing the songs. I found out later that Foxx uses opaque eye prosthetics and actually was 'blind' for fourteen hours at a time during the filming. Also, Mr. Foxx revealed today on CNN that he is a classically trained pianist and his hands were seen in all the piano keyboard shots in the movie. 'Ray' primarily covers the highs and lows of the first forty years of Ray's life and his battle with heroin addiction. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, and the film itself is a true achievement. We're treated to a chronology of the ground-breaking music derived from the courage of this blind, black man. Ray Charles never forgot his mother's forceful admonition to stand on his own two feet and not let himself become a 'cripple' -- because of his blindness. So, he was heroic even as part of him was lost to heroin. Over and over, he demanded to be allowed to do it his way and broke ground where other performers had not succeeded. Live audiences and record fans were treated to his new creations year after year. The film is an inspirational story of Ray Charles' accomplishments and a celebration of his music. It may be the best film of the year and Jaime Foxx may have nailed the best performance by an actor. Rated A++.",9,1,3,29 October 2004
Cinderella Man," 'Cinderella Man' is captivating and completely believable!
","'Cinderella Man'  WOW! 'Cinderella Man' cast  WOW! 'Cinderella Man' script  WOW! WOW, WOW, WOW  what a movie! The new film 'Cinderella Man' is the true story of boxer James J. (Jim) Braddock. This film is stunning and exciting from beginning to end. In my opinion, it's the best movie so far in 2005, and it may well be the second boxing movie in two years to win the Academy's nod for Best Picture. How can I say this? Well, Russell Crowe as Braddock has never been better. Incredible! Director Ron Howard also gets terrific performances from Renée Zellweger as Braddock's wife, Mae, and from talented actor Paul Giamatti as Joe Gould.What a lucky hit and maybe it was more than luck that reunited Academy Award-winning producer Brian Grazer, director Ron Howard, and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (all Oscar winners for 2001's 'A Beautiful Mind') with Oscar winner Russell Crowe. What a team and what a story! The film recreates the pain of the dark days of 1930s Depression in a way that will stir you to the core. Braddock, a once-promising heavyweight boxer, struggles along with wife Mae to survive and hold their family together. Braddock's impressive run of wins has been surpassed by a string of losses that has rendered him a ring has-been, grubbing for any kind of work. Then an unlikely stroke of good fortune  a last minute cancellation  offers Braddock one more night in the ring against a second-ranked world contender. Unbelievable  except it really happened  Braddock, with no training for the fight, wins that match. Everywhere in the country, this new hero  who is one of their own  uplifts the downtrodden people living through this terrible time. Those controlling the matches can't ignore Braddock's popularity and the potential for profit as the old man is brought back to fight young savages who will probably kill him. (Shades of 'Million Dollar Baby'!)You'll be on the edge of your seat for the whole play-out. If you're a boxing fan, you probably know what happens  but I won't spoil it for you if you don't know. Either way, don't miss this dream moviea true-life fairy tale. I'm giving 'Cinderella Man' an 'A++' on my Entertainment Report Card.",10,14,23,25 May 2005
