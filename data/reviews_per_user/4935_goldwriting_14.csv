Moneyball," Pitt Swings for the Fences
","As we start heading into the commonly known 'Oscar season', I just get more and more excited each weekend. There is always some movie sparking my interest just around the corner, a new film I've been reading about for months and trying with all my powers to not let the bar of hope get raised too high. There are always going to be disappointments, even when they are good films, because I was waiting for great, but what keeps me going are those films who look up at the bar and say, 'Oh yeah, not a problem.' Welcome to one of those filmsMoneyball is based on the true story of Billy Beane, a one-time possible superstar in the MLB who turned general manager of the Oakland A's. After missing once again on his chance for the World Series crown, Beane went rogue, adopted a new system and went after players using a statistical model instead of banking on superstars. It threatened everything the game was built on, it threatened the way things were done in sports, and worst of allit worked.Aaron Sorkin's name on the poster was the first thing to catch my eye. I sat there as the lights went down and wondered if he could keep his winning streak going (his last two, Charlie Wilson's War and The Social Network being two of my favorite all time movies). So without wanting to, my bar was already set high into the stratosphere, but as the credits rolled, I felt the film had touched the clouds. Maybe it didn't hit open space, but still miles above most of what we see on a week-to-week basis. You could feel his power in the dialogue; some classic Sorkin work. I could almost feel particular scenes the way they would have been played on stage. The film wasn't loaded up with as many quick witted tit-for-tat moments as his last two films, instead it flowed with much more subtlety, using a more even keel in order to lead the audience through an entire season of baseball. I don't want to give all the credit to Sorkin, since the writing credit is split between himself and Steven Zallian (an Oscar winner himself), but I really don't know how the work balanced out between them. That split might also be some of the reason why Moneyball doesn't have that normal Sorkin whip-crack pacing.Yet, no matter how well the words are written, they still have to be delivered by someone with the skill and sincerity to make them land and Brad Pitt did not disappoint. Without knowing too much of the original story beforehand I was a little concerned with seeing Pitt in this role, which I previously only thought of as a general manager of a baseball team. What really saves him and grounds it in believability is the history of Billy Beane being a failed baseball superstar. Pitt brought the subtle sorrow, the underlying regret he always had nipping at his heels, which helps fuel his desire not only to win, but also to see the game fundamentally changed. What I found most impressive was somewhere along the way, I forgot I was watching Brad Pitt. He disappeared into a dip-spitting, hand-nosed gambler just trying his damnedest to pull off the greatest underdog victory in history. Those are rare performances and they should be recognized as such.Jonah Hill came along for the ride, playing Peter Brand, the young economics genius who helped develop the formula Beane uses to build his new championship-hopeful team. It definitely is the most dramatic role Hill has tackled so far and put him toe-to-toe with a modern-day film legend in Pitt. Hill held his own and refused to settle for sitting in Pitt's shadow. In terms of the performances, my only disappointment was with one of my favorite living actors, Philip Seymour Hoffman. It has nothing to do with his take on Art Howe, the coach of the team under Beane. It was more to do with him barely being a part of the story. He got a precious few scenes early on in the film and then disappeared completely almost halfway through the movie. I just wish we could have gotten more of him and Pitt dueling, as he did so brilliantly with Tom Hanks in Charlie Wilson's War.In the end, Moneyball did reach my bar of hope and expectation, but it didn't blow if off the chart as his past two films have.",Null,0,0,6 October 2011
The Avengers," The Hulk (and Others) Smash Expectations
","This is what we have been waiting for. The culmination of years of planning, years of filming and years of cross-pollination of characters throughout the Marvel movie universe. The bar was set unbelievably high and I did my best to temper my expectations as I walked into the theater along with the millions upon millions of moviegoers this opening weekend. When the lights dropped, I mentally wiped the slate clean and hoped beyond hope that it was good (at least better than Iron Man 2). As so many other people have said by now, I was more than pleased.The Avengers follows the beginning of one of Marvel comics most powerful supergroups, as the world finds itself woefully unprepared for an alien onslaught led by the scorned demi-god, Loki. While the various heroes don't play nicely together at first, they come together when the time comes and prove they are much more powerful together than apart. Together, they are unstoppable.Many of the reviews have been focusing on Mark Ruffalo and his charismatic portrayal of Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk. Originally much of the focus was on him because he is now the third actor in as many films to play the legendary green behemoth. Yet after the release, the buzz stayed on him because he brought something to Hulk that was sorely lacking before, humanity. Arguably Ruffalo wasn't on screen a ton and it's hard to say whether we have been so amazed with his performance if it was ninety minutes or more, but since Marvel and company immediately signed him to a six-picture deal to continue being big, green and angry, we will all get our chance to test the theory out. I've always loved Ruffalo as an actor and I have all the faith in the world he can make this rage monster a dynamic character to watch, but the real gamble will come in the script. We've seen full movies with Eric Bana and Edward Norton already, so this next one (or two, or three) need to bring something different, not just a rehash of those before. Luckily, the Avengers phenomenon also allows the next Hulk picture to skip over the origin story, since it's fairly unnecessary now.While Ruffalo can rightly bask in the glow of a job exceedingly well done, the rest of the cast deserves praise as well. Everyone up and down the line brought their A-game and they played off each other incredibly well. Robert Downey Jr. can sometimes overshadow people on screen, just due to his charisma, but he did exactly what he said his character of Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, couldn't doplay nicely with others. However, the pressure was really more on Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) and Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow) since they were only side jobs in some of the previous Marvel chapters. Each did a great job, with extra credit given to Johannson (and possibly her fight double if she had one) for her intro sequence with the Russian mobsters.I can't close this review out without bringing up one of the real-life superheros of the story, writer/director Joss Whedon. The man is a living legend in the geek community and this film proves the accolades and unending praise are well-founded. He achieved a perfect balance of action, pace, and story all while managing to encompass the overabundance of characters. Jokes were well-timed and well-delivered and he allowed for possibly risky moments to go all out, resulting in one of the most hilarious and enjoyable scenes in Marvel movie history (you'll know it when you see it).Sure, there are some nit-picky moments that you can dig up if you're so inclined. Feel free to send me what you think those might be and I'll gladly drop in some of mine. Yet, in the end, the experience is what counts and I couldn't wipe the smile off my face as I left (and not just because the final extra scene at the end of the final credits was pure genius). This movie captured absolutely every bit of the tone and energy of a comic book summer blockbuster and if Whedon was a professor, this would be his Master Class.",10,6,11,8 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Downey Charms Inside Surprisingly Simple Plot
","I couldn't wait for the weekend to begin because I knew I was going to hit up a popcorn, blockbuster double-header in the theater, Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows and Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, a back- to-back pairing almost unmatched this year. Two incredibly big budget franchises with two incredibly charismatic leading men. These are the box office battles I just live for. Since the weekend numbers have already come in, we've seen Sherlock Holmes dominate the weekend ($40 million vs. $13 million for Mission Impossible), so the honor of first review goes to them.Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows picks up fairly close to where the last one left off. Watson is getting married and Holmes is closing in on his arch-enemy, Professor Moriarty. The two masterminds face off against each other in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse which threatens not only the life of our quixotic hero, but his best friend and possibly the entire world beyond.It's likely been said before, and as much as I hate repetition I'll forego it this one time, Robert Downey Jr. was born for this role. Obviously the historical version of Holmes was tweaked and crafted around Downey's skills and persona, but the magical merge between the real person and the literary classic created something perfect which will be cherished by viewers for generations to come. All future attempts at playing Holmes, which I am sure there will be someday, will be weighed against Downey, a bar now set incredibly high. His charm, wit and energy flow through the scenes effortlessly, keeping the audience in tow no matter what is going on. He also lets his co-stars, like Jude Law (as Dr. Watson) and Jared Harris (as Prof. Moriarty) own the moment equally, not overshadowing their own crisp deliveries and subtle mannerisms. From back-to-front, the performances throughout were playful, charming and more than enough to please any afternoon crowd.So if everyone was so great in it, why is the rating so low? That is a fantastic question.The downfall here is the script. If you are going to create a story for the world's most renowned investigator, you need to plunge the imagination of the audience into a world of multiple story lines, interconnecting webs of deceit and subterfuge, something only Holmes could solve. The first film had this, but Game of Shadows rolls out a plot all too plain for such a complicated enemy like Moriarty. There seemed to be an effort to cover that up by actually showing a room full of interconnecting threads built by Holmes, to demonstrate how complicated this all really was, but that felt a cheap way out for writing a more complex story. Moriarty is the epitome of villains, the mental match for Sherlock Holmes, and in the end he just turns out to be greedy, a motive far below the weight of his character.Guy Ritchie, the returning director, held up his side of the bargain, but didn't push anything forward in terms of the style and execution. We got more slam-to-slow-motion shots and a couple good moments of Holmes playing out the oncoming violence in his head in order to predict the exact counter maneuvers. I will give both Ritchie and the screenwriters credit through for the final scene between Holmes and Moriarty, which I won't go into detail about, but it was a nice twist on a familiar theme in this franchise.",6,1,6,20 December 2011
The Hunger Games," The Next Bog Thing (But Does It Deserve It?)
","Out with the old (Potter and those shiny vampires), in with the new! The Hunger Games is the next in line of young adult adaptations steamrolling their way into the theaters, to the extreme delight and disappointment of fans of the books.The arguments are eternal: Did it really capture the tone of the book? Did they get all the details right? Did that character actually look like that?On and on they go, but really, the only question that should be asked is, did they make a good movie? In order to get that answer, let's move right ahead into the review and see what made it onto the big screen.The Hunger Games is a dystopian tale of twelve outlying districts that must sacrifice one young boy and one young girl up to their capital every year to participate in a televised battle to the death. Katniss Everdeen volunteers herself in place of her younger sister and we follow her into battle, not only over the other 'tributes', but also over the deadly pitfalls in the arena and the bloodthirsty nature of a society that allows these games to continue.First off, this movie clocked in at just under two and a half hours, which is incredibly long for a teen flick. Even Harry Potter didn't dare create such a marathon until well into the franchise where they knew fans would eat up every minute of it. Also highlighting the length was the incredibly slow pacing. The experience was oddly reminiscent of seeing The Da Vinci Code, where the original book was an eye-popping page turner, but the on-screen rendition seemed to suck all the life out of it. The Hunger Games didn't quite starve itself into a cinematic coma, but there certainly was a momentum and energy missing in the translation.As for the actors, Jennifer Lawrence was the prodigal choice and really brought much of that angst, conflict and fire-in-the-belly attitude Katniss needed to have. Josh Hutcherson also displayed a great deal of the heartfelt charm and inner strength that made Peeta such an easy character to root for in the books. Wes Bentley also gets a special mention for pulling off the expertly choreographed beard, but I missed a touch of the creepiness I expected from the Head Gamekeeper. Beyond that, everyone I felt did what they needed to do, but there weren't any stand out performances.The story was there, the pages played out on-screen almost right off the page, but it felt like they tried too hard to capture everything from the book, making it overly long, yet dropped particular sections that would have better served the overall experience. In that regard, without going into too much detail, I'll point to the mutts and how disappointing that entire sequence was. The whole point of who and what they were was lost, making them nothing more than aggressive bulldogs.Now there have been reviews buzzing around all weekend about this movie, so this will likely get swept away in the digital wind of the internet, but I must say this in closing. To those people who were upset because Rue and Thresh were cast as African-Americans, while Suzanne Collins didn't feel the need to spend a whole lot of time and energy repeatedly describing the races of her characters, those two were in fact written as 'dark skinned', so the casting was not 'politically correct', just correct. Secondly, to those people who went the step further to say that you felt less when they died because of that casting, yep, you guessed it, you're racist.",6,1,5,30 March 2012
The Rocker," Comedy Rhythms with Heart
","This summer we have seen everything in the realm of comedy from forty-year-old children and weed fueled action heroes to bumbling super spies and blackfaced primadonnas. It has truly been the summer of high concept, but the audiences are just about ripe for something solid, something familiar and something just under the radar. Who knew it would come in the form of Dwight from The Office? The Rocker follows the dream which never quite came true for our main character, Fish. He was the drummer in a band, but in order to rocket their career to unheard of levels, they had to drop him. Drop they did, and Fish dwindles into obscurity and ambivalence towards life itself. Twenty years later the universe smiles on him once more and he gets the chance to play drums in his nephew's band. Through a series of pop culture twists and turns the band ends up becoming an overnight sensation and Fish runs wild through the fields of his waking dreams, while learning the lessons of what it really takes to be the member of a band, not a one man show. Of course, he is not the only one learning lessons, but he's the main dude on the poster, you know how it goes.Getting myself comfy in the cushioned theater chair, I was fully expecting a slapstick style, overgrown childhood movie with Rainn Wilson taking charge of the blundering and buffoonery, but what flickered on the screen in front of me was much more than prop jokes and prat falls. The Rocker sneaks by the chuckles and laughter and weasels into your heart with a subtly touching story and some really soft moments. Rainn does get hit by numerous objects and suffers more than his share of bodily harm, but he also never wavers from believing his dream is right and true, not some childhood fantasy. The more subtle comedic moments are left to Josh Gad, who plays his socially awkward nephew/keyboard player. Josh delivers more than a few times and his style felt oddly akin to Dan Fogler ala Balls of Fury, a kind of straight line delivery for a ludicrous line on the page. Rounding out the bandmates are Emma Stone and Teddy Geiger. Emma personifies the 'i-hate-everyone-but-the-people-in-this-band' chick, while Teddy has no problem with his sensitive, soulful lead singer persona. For those who don't already know, this is a touch into the area of typecasting since Teddy Geiger already has a wildly popular album called Underage Thinking and he lent his pop music talents to almost all the original music in the movie. Since they were able to write songs from the characters perspective and not just layer in current pop tracks, The Rocker tips gently into the genre of musical, because the songs actually investigate the emotional state of the characters and move the story along. Also, while Teddy is selling movie tickets and soundtracks, Emma Stone is doing what few actors, especially at the young age of twenty, get to do; open two movies in the same week! The Rocker beat it to the punch, but The House Bunny opens this coming Friday and Emma co-stars in that alongside and Anna Faris and Rumor Willis. It's a one-two punch for the young ingénue who last charmed people as the girl of Seth's dreams in Superbad.Lending a hand to the laugh level were a number of cameos and side characters. Jason Sudeikis from SNL drops by to play the slimiest of record label agents in recent movie history. There are moments you want to punch him, but then you wonder what might get on your hands and if it would wash off later. Christina Applegate plays Teddy Geiger's mom and tries to balance out the adult-to-child ratio in the mix. She does a decent job and has some truly biting lines (rebutting being called a MILF by replying with calling the man a PILS, you'll have to see it to get the definition, but I think my best friend will be using it for the rest of her life). Demetri Martin also shows up as the epitome of pretentious, film school drop out, ultra hipster music video directors and it gave me a medium level of anxiety just imagining being on a set with a character like that.This was honestly the last movie I had any inkling would stir any feelings beyond a bubbling chuckle in my belly, but there is a sweetness to the story and an honesty to the message. It all boils down to follow your dreams, no matter the cost. If that message is spoken faithfully, no matter what story you wrap it in, there will be some people in that audience walking out a little lighter in their step, just itching to get home and pull out their old hobbies, guitars, etc. Don't get me wrong, this is no Rocky, I doubt many people will suddenly become rock stars after seeing this, but they might just get a tiny bit of inspiration from the best place possible; somewhere unexpected.Recommendation: I was completely surprised by it, but I'm a sucker for a sweet story. Some good comedic moments, but they are outweighed and outnumbered by the more heartfelt ones. If you're looking for down-and-out comedy, this might no be crude enough for you. Yet, if you want something simple, with a nice rhythm, this could be the right beat for your Saturday afternoon.p.s. Christina Applegate also holds one of the best honors ever, being mentioned in the P.M. Dawn song, Set Adrift on Memory Bliss. Let's be honest, where can you possibly go from there?",7,2,5,21 August 2008
21 Jump Street," Retro Remake Delivers Laughs Galore
","I was there. I remember the moment when this project got announced and I felt the familiar tearing of a piece of my childhood ripped violently from my past and stomped on the ground in front of me. We've been trained by a culture of recycled and rehashed content, making what was once hilarious into something kitschy and embarrassing, turning us into shell-shocked survivors of our own cherished memories. So to say the bar was set low for this would be an understatement of epic proportions, but that's where the creators get their edge, because there is nowhere to go but up. And they did.21 Jump Street follows two former high school enemies who become best friends while training together in the police academy. They find themselves busted down into an undercover program specializing in investigating high schools. Assigned to root out the supply chain of a dangerous new synthetic drug, the two partners try to balance doing their job against the opportunity to re-live high school, for better or for worse.One of the best things about moving something from the TV to the big screen (which may be one of the only things) is it can open up the latitudes of what those characters can say, do and get away with. How many times did you wish one of our 80s sitcom heroes would just drop that bad guy off the roof, saying 'Seriously, that guy deserved it.' 21 Jump Street recognizes that freedom and relishes it from beginning to end without making the classic mistake of overdoing it. They remembered the simple fact that there was a story still needing to be told in order to bring it all together. It's a delicate balancing act; expanding on the original TV concept, catering to the die-hard fans and making it enjoyable for the newcomers. The people at the helm were able to achieve it with apparent ease, but what may surprise some people is just who those people are: Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.Beyond starring in the film, and reportedly becoming best friends off- screen in the process, Hill and Tatum are listed as Executive Producers on the film. While that title holds many different meanings in Hollywood, from complete controlling interest in a project to just some guy with a checkbook who never even steps on the set, the fact that Hill and Tatum are listed I believe showed a surprising dedication to the project not common to the actors of their generation. Hill is also credited as co-writer of the story, which as I mentioned before, is an integral part of what made this remake a success. The balance between buddy comedy, coming-of-age, action and tempered sex comedy brought so many flavors to the table it was nearly impossible to walk out and say nothing on-screen actually made you laugh.The cast choices were also spot on with current comedic favorites like Rob Riggle, Ellie Kemper and Nick Offerman. This trio shaped and smoothed out the comedic arcs when the main characters had to focus on actually moving the story along. Then comes two of the best cameos of all time: Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise, original cast members from the TV show. They bridged the gap between history and present day in an incredibly hilarious scene, which can only be seen to be fully appreciated. Not to be left out, fellow original cast members Holly Robinson Peete had a walk on in an early motor pool scene and Dustin Nguyen is actually on a TV in the background later in the film.",8,0,3,21 March 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," The Real Hero is Underneath the Mask.
","Yes, this is yet another comic book superhero movie. Yes, this is another Marvel comic big- budget franchise trying to get off the ground. You might start to wonder why you should bother seeing any of these if a new one just hits the screens one month later. First off, it definitely helps to be a comic book fan from the start, but beyond that, in terms of pure movie magic and box office trending, this newest chapter gets a little boost from being the last in a long line of films leading to a culminating epic fanboys have been frothing over for years now The Avengers! But, I'll dip more into that later, for now, let's look at the throwback hero of the group who takes us back to a time when heroes were not only cheered for their strength, but also for their conduct.Captain America: The First Avenger details the transformation of a skinny kid named Steve Rogers into the national icon (and medically-induced super-soldier) known as Captain America. Rogers is created into this new evolution of man in order to combat Hydra, the deep science/black arts division of the Nazi army, led by a ruthless tyrant named Johann Schmidt, who is more frighteningly referred to as The Red Skull (you know, cause his face fell off and such). Captain America must prove to the people who gave him his powers, and to himself, that he was the right man to do the job of saving the world from utter annihilation.I had fairly muted expectations going into this movie, mainly because Captain America is essentially a retro-hero, a classic clean-cut good guy with no character flaws. He always does the right thing, or at least attempts to, no matter the cost to himself. It flies in the face of everything we have been seeing in terms of comic book heroes over the last decade. The grief and anger of Batman, the drunken power trips or Spider-man, the ego and pride of Thor; all these traits give the characters layers that assist in making them human, someone the audience can try to relate to. Captain America really doesn't have any of those flaws, but here's the surprise they made it work anyway. The opening thirty minutes of the film we see Steve Rogers pre-magic-roid-juice, where he is a ninety-pound poster boy for the 'Before' shot in workout ad campaigns. In those early scenes his struggle is how to find a way to match his frail muscles outside with his unbreakable drive inside. We find ourselves in the hopeful spot of routing for the little guy (and I mean really, really little, like me in high school) and those opening scenes help pull the crowd in, hopefully holding them there through what comes later.Once we lose the physicality of the 'before' picture and it's replaced with superhuman 'after' shot, it loses a bit of the charm. Chris Evans should take no blame for this, in fact I think he was cast perfectly. He held on nicely to the innocence of his smaller self and truthfully brought to life the heroic nature of those comics from the late 40′s and early 50′s. The real downfall was that he didn't face any real obstacle after he got his new physical form. We never really felt he was ever in any real danger because he could basically accomplish anything that came to mind, no matter how insane.On the topic of the shield, our iconic piece of comic book memorabilia, I was torn on it. I liked the design and the fact it could get scuffed up, dirtied and otherwise sullied, but I would have appreciated one scene where we got to see him learn to throw it. Within one scene of him picking it up for the first time, he was chucking it around like a world-class discuss champion, fully expecting it to return to him, instead of wondering how the hell that worked. The minor flaw sort of mirrors the bigger issue that the latter half of the movie was really just a long montage of Captain America jumping, swinging, shield tossing and otherwise being heroic (lots of it in slow motion). The heart fell out of it and the movie descended into flashy colors and catch phrases.In terms of the cast, as I said before, Chris Evans did a hell of a job and I look forward to him building up the character even more, hopefully with more internal struggles in movies to come. *minor spoiler coming*Sadly gone after the first thirty minutes, Stanley Tucci was wonderful as Dr. Abraham Erskine , the scientist behind the super-serum, which made the man out of the molehill. Tucci worked in such charm and natural flavor into his German accent and characterizations, I really wish he could have stayed on screen much longer.*spoiler over*Getting back to the real buzz around this movie, the next film in line for Marvel Studios is The Avengers, the first time any studio in the recent decades has tried to tie together a handful of other movie franchises into one single film. The Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Nick Fury, Hawkeye (who Jeremy Renner cameoed as in Thor) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson in Iron Man 2) will all assemble on screen for the eagerly anticipated culmination of Marvel's long term film plan. The genius inside is they are using all the original actors who made these roles so popular (with the exception of Hulk, who was played by Edward Norton in the franchise film and now replaced by Mark Ruffalo). For me, as a movie junkie, this is where the franchise will become something truly special. Just to see all those actors on screen playing off of each other is immediately worth the price of admission (and maybe a box of Raisinettes too).",Null,6,14,27 July 2011
Burn After Reading," Burn After Reading: Coen's Bring Imperfect Wackiness
","As September crosses into the present, film critics and aficionados everywhere begin grinning and twitching in excitement. Oscar movies are officially on their way to the nearest silver screen. With the ribbon of quality content being cut, the first expected contender came from the brotherly duo not unfamiliar with the Oscar machine, the Coen Brothers, Joel and Ethan. Fresh off the heels of their Best Directing, Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay Oscars last year for No Country for Old Men, the cinematic brothers brought us a new chapter in their visual memoirs, Burn After Reading, a throwback to the darkly humorous days of Fargo, which also won them a Best Original Screenplay statue. Into the mix of directorial style and writing finesse we gained the acting skills of Brad Pitt, George Clooney, John Malkovich and Tilda Swinton. Frances McDormand is also along for the ride, but she's a Coen staple (and also married to half the duo, Joel Coen). This movie had Oscar potential written all over it, so the only question going in was would it live up to the expectations? Swingthe ball connectsit's going deepalmost thereawww. Ground rule double.This is not an Academy award winning film and certainly not one of their best, but still a nice way to slide into the season of quality content over box office boffo. Burn After Reading is a quirky, silly tale following a disc of information thought to contain CIA secrets from a disgraced and angry analyst (Malkovich), which is found in a local gym and tightly grasped by the hands of a woman (McDormand) desperate for money to cover her plastic surgeries. Mostly what the Coen brothers are known for is the depth and creativity of their characters and this film does well to cover the bases on that point. Frances McDormand plays Linda, a terribly pathetic woman so deathly afraid of aging and the current state of her body that she has blinders on to the rest of the world and the happiness it can offer. She brings the solid level of commitment and shine we've come to know her for. Brad Pitt joins in with what has to be his silliest and least intelligent character to date, Chad, a constantly hyper-active, exercise fanatic who works with Linda at a gym called Hardbodies. I have to imagine this was a fun role for him to play since he hardly gets to let loose like this anymore, not since 12 Monkeys. He provided a lot of the early humor in the film, but also drops one of the biggest plot twists halfway through. Clooney brings to life Harry, a ex-personal bodyguard with a penchant for compulsive lying and an addiction to sex. George only gets to be this wacky under the tutelage of the Coen brothers, so even while it's not his best work by any means, it's a fun reminder that he can indeed get goofy with the rest of the gang. Tilda plays the ice queen wife of Malkovich, while also having an affair with Clooney. Watching her in this role, along with some others, I wonder when her picture will be included in the dictionary next to 'emasculating'. Not to be left out of any discussion about over-the-top characters, Malkovich plays his part to the hilt, but I honestly feel his best moments are in the opening scene. There's not much of an arc for him, so only seeing him come to life early on really provides any surprise and unseen moments.Burn plays inside the footprints of Fargo, but never quite catches up to it. The Coens obviously know their craft and continue to put material out there with their own voice and character stamp, but this film felt a little like a step back for them. Maybe it was just a way to resettle into the dark comedy they are known for after their detour into heavy drama with No Country. Also running parallel to this is the question of the marketing campaign. Again the trailer was cut in a fashion to show one type of movie, but once you were in the theater it became something different, not wildly so, but still there is a distinct shift in tone from wacky comedy to dark comedy, and sometimes those audiences don't mix well. It's like seeing a trailer for Police Academy and getting Rushmore. Two great tastes that taste awful together.Recommendation: If you're a devout fan, you've already seen it anyway. If you're on the fence, wait until video. If you're completely on the other side of the fence, you still read this far anyway? I'll take that as a compliment. Thanks. :)",6,4,10,25 September 2008
Hugo," Finding the Magic in Dreams
","Yes, this 3D trend has gotten a little more than annoying recently, but mainly my rage about it is focused at studios that purposefully add this gimmick only to jack up the ticket price and bring nothing additional to the movie experience when the film wasn't shot in 3D. I avoid tempting my anger over this issue by mostly seeing everything in 2D when offered (unless I know for a fact it was shot in 3D) and this tip keeps me calm and content during my numerous cinema trips. Yet, when a legend in the industry, like Martin Scorsese, decides to shoot his new film in 3D, that can be enough to tempt me into dropping the few extra dollars. So I went, I watched, and I fell into his fantastical world.Hugo is the story of a small orphan boy who lives in the train station. His sole obsession is to finish fixing a small robotic person that his father found. Hoping to build himself a new friend, Hugo slowly gains the support of a young girl and together they chase after the breadcrumbs of a mystery that very well may link them together in ways they never dreamed of.Since I led this review with my feelings on 3D, let me first congratulate Scorcese on achieving a beauty and simplicity for this technology seemingly avoided by most other directors (James Cameron gets a pass on this too, since the 3D in Avatar was insanely well done). Right off the bat, the snow falling in the foreground was amazing and added a rich texture to the scene. That straightforward approach to the use of 3D held on through the rest of the film, not overdoing it with overtly sensationalized moments, but using the technology to enhance the depth and reality of the story on screen. Chalk this up as another point for those directors and studios who choose to use 3D from the outset to enrich the experience instead of after the fact in order to enrich their pockets.** Spoilers ahead – Hard to avoid when talking about the story on this one. **Now comes the story, or I should correctly say 'stories', both rich enough to be their own movie. You have the original story of Hugo and his mysterious machine boy, then later comes another adventure about legendary film auteur, George Melies, who was believed to have died in the war, but turns out to be living in an apartment in Paris trying to forget everything about those magical movie-making times. Screenwriter John Logan captured exactly the magic I feel when I sit in that darkened room and am transported away to an unlimited number of worlds. I relished those touching moments where Melies waxed poetically about where dreams came from and how we could all live better lives by helping bring those into reality. I loved both story lines, but found the connection between them a little forced and unfinished.Another portion of Hugo's personal story, the one about the machine, which strongly resonated with me was his desire to always fix things. There are few things in this world more pure than a desire just to see everyone and everything working at their utmost intended perfection. We all want to be the best versions of ourselves and most of us would also lend a hand if it meant bringing someone else to their pinnacle as well. It rang a touch similar to Pay It Forward, but not nearly as heavy- handed.Scorcese and Logan did an amazing job in creating a rich and lavish landscape of characters inside the train station, but I ended up wanting Hugo to interact with them much more. Since he really doesn't, it makes all those layers feel superfluous and unnecessary.",7,4,6,5 December 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Truly Hip to Be Square
","Could it really be possible? Could one movie company really release two movies in under two months deserving of my greatest accolade: a perfect score? I don't give them out easily, many times feeling at least one little thing was out of place or lacking in the overall composition of the film, but almost in back-to-back form Universal Studios has made their mark on the summer with the release of one of the most anticipated comic book adaptations of the summer (at least by a small group of fanboys and fangirls).Scott Pilgrim vs. The World brings to life the tale of an adorably square hipster/bass player named Scott Pilgrim. While trying to mend his broken heart and shake his unwelcomed status of 'dump-ee', he dreams about a punk-chic on roller blades and his world trips down the rabbit hole when he finds that the dream girl is real. Compelled to court her, he discovers that to win her companionship he must defeat in battle her seven evil Ex's, each still equally enchanted and desperate for the love of this oddly endearing young girl.While so many things came together in perfect harmony here, for the first time in a long while, first credit and top billing for the success needs to go to the man on top of the totem pole, director Edgar Wright. Erupting from the mind that brought us Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz (plus the equally amazing, but woefully less well-known, Spaced), Scott Pilgrim displays the same skill and amazing amounts of research into the genre, which helped transform his earlier efforts into trophy case pieces of what makes a great film. So many tiny moments, pixelated pop-ups and even audio reminders of the original Nintendo generation helped shape the universe of Pilgrim into one we not only believed in, but recognized from our youth. The tone, the atmosphere, even the overly romanticized quest, it all hearkens back to the roots of comic book caricature mixed with action hero devotion. Without diving into too much more detail and turning this into a novella of wonderment about Wright and his talents, I will just say that as the captain of this ship, he steered brilliantly and I would very much like to see him awarded for it, even if that seems unlikely (although with a 10 movie Best Picture category, it's not impossible).Moving on to those lucky souls who got to inhabit these wonderful characters, it is a pantheon of young Hollywood elite who earn each and every second of their on-screen glory. Michael Cera, once dangerously on the verge of over-exposure and being perennially typecast, has surged back with his touchingly awkward, yet awesomely heroic rendition of the lead, Scott Pilgrim. This time Cera really feels like he is fully in touch with his capabilities and embraces the geek charm which many were beginning to feel was holding him back and turning him into a cultural antique before its time. What was also great is no one would really find a fight scene with Michael Cera truly believable in a normal world, but the world of Scott Pilgrim is legions away from normal. Blending comic book candor, anime stylings and 8-bit video game action gave Cera a universe he could truly become the nerd warrior of our fantasies. As the woman of his quirky and vivid dreams, Mary Elizabeth Winstead delights as Ramona Flowers, creating one of those tragically cute girls all men want to win and make happy for the rest of their days. She also tiptoes down that tightrope between confidence and cowardice, showing humanity in its most simple and pure form. Peppering the outskirts of this incredibly creative world, much can be said about the co-stars and side characters. Amazing on all counts, they helped firm up the reality of the world by embracing their individual quirks and all playing in that same wonderful tone. A special mention needs to go out to Kieran Culkin, who played Pilgrim's sexually voracious gay roommate. His darkly comic timing and constant calling of 'bullsh*t' to the rest of the characters helped keep the story from spiraling off into a cartoonish purgatory.Anyone who owned the original Nintendo should love this film. This is made specifically for you. As for the rest of the world, there is heart and humor to be had, but it might get lost on you behind the screen of random quick edits and constant cultural in-jokes. It has not gotten its due in the box office, but I guarantee this will become a cult classic on the DVD market. I'm already dusting off a space on my shelf for it.",10,2,11,25 August 2010
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Age of Ultron Keeps the Pressure On
","The steamrolling new cinematic world of Marvel movies continues with round two of the Avengers storyline, Avengers: Age of Ultron. With Joss Whedon once again behind the camera and behind the pen, the bar was set pretty high, but he met expectations in more ways than one. Avengers: Age of Ultron deals with the central fear of Tony Stark, who has seen through the looking glass into the universe beyond and knows what's out there. No known power on Earth can stop what's coming, even his new team of superheroes, so Stark decides to build an artificial weapon strong enough to defend the planet for them. Not the most unique of ideas, but anytime someone builds artificial intelligence, it inevitably turns against them. The Avengers must come together quickly to fix Stark's mistake, while dealing with the introduction of two new mutants, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who have a deep seated hatred for Stark and his history of weapons manufacturing. Going into this film, it is impossible to truly measure the cultural and economic weight it was under. The first film grossed over $1.5 billion dollars, which because of other massive tentpole successes, $1 billion dollars is slowly becoming the threshold to pass in order to be called a 'huge win' for the studio. On top of that, The Avengers created the new algorithm for bringing a number of unique comic book hero movies together into one grand franchise. This is already being repeated by other studios (especially Warner Brothers and DC Comics) and it will continue to be the pattern for the foreseeable future. Marvel figured out the key and it unlocked the movie universe for decades to come. The performances in Age of Ultron were mostly up to my expectations. Robert Downey Jr. continues to bring depth and failings to Iron Man, while Mark Ruffalo rages forward as the best actor to ever play the Hulk (sorry, Bill Bixby.) Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans hold up their end of the bargain as Thor and Captain America, respectively. No one falls behind, even with the cameos of Don Cheadle as War Machine, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, and Anthony Mackie as The Falcon. Yet, to me the standouts in relation to the returning cast have to go to Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow) and Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye.) Johansson continues to peel back the layers of Black Widow's early childhood trauma and the effects of her brutal training as one of the world's best assassins. Renner stands alone in this movie as the emotional glue, the magnet that holds together the theme in this chapter, which is family. Newcomers Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen move far beyond their brief cameo in Captain America: Winter Soldier as the dangerous Russian twins, Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch. Taylor-Johnson gets to play both the smoldering anger of a child who's seen too much horror and the protective older brother who would do anything to protect surviving member of his family. Olsen also has similar traits, but her power burns much stronger and with it also comes her frailty in how to use and control it. She's not yet a soldier when the film begins, but the events that unfold force her to make that choice. James Spader provides the sinister voice and machine madness of Ultron. Once again a massively popular household name, Spader brings much of the same arrogance of his lead character in the hit TV show, The Blacklist, but here it's as if that character loses his cool. Insanely brilliant, insanely powerful, and just plain insane.Balancing him out is the final character premier in the film, Vision, played beautifully by Paul Bettany. I was worried because Vision is a hard character to make emotionally compelling since he is almost purely logical and they could have easily fallen into the same trap as The Watchmen and the character of Dr. Manhattan. Yet, Bettany showed once again why he is one of the best in his generation and why Marvel does not skimp on effort or money to get the most talented people for the part. He overlays his logic with love, his power with purpose, and his intensity with intelligence. This is a character I am going to really enjoy watching grow in the coming films. Another impressively well written, structured and acted film from the Marvel universe, Avengers: Age of Ultron will not disappoint new fans, old fans, or go down in film history as 'the weak part of the franchise.'",9,21,45,5 May 2015
Super 8," Super 8: The Super Combo Delivers Best of the Year
","One is a legend in the movie industry, the other is the current hot ticket with a winning streak not seen in a long, long time. Sometimes when teams like this are paired up, the expectations can be unbearable and completely fantastical, but J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg are not ones to break under the pressure of expectations. The stage was set perfectly for them and they delivered brilliantly with an homage to each other's previous works and the simple storytelling styles of film classics gone by.Super 8 surrounds a group of movie loving misfits who find their town the unwilling center of a government takeover after a terrible and deadly train accident. While filming their own Super 8 movie for a local festival, they bear witness to the escape of something unexplainable, setting up a quest the kids must all rise to complete or watch their friends, families and entire town get erased from the map.Jeff Goldsmith, the Q&A master behind the popular podcast The Q&A with Jeff Goldsmith sent out this tweet after screening this new summer throwback:'I just saw Super 8. Wanna know the guarded 'secret' behind it? Abrams uses plenty of screen time to develop characters you'll care about. (@yogoldsmith)'As usual, Jeff nailed it on the head. Above and beyond all the other things that done right in the making of this film, it is the writing and careful execution of creating characters that are human, real and inherently lovable. Super 8 brings back the youthful purity of classics like E.T., The Goonies and Stand by Me, something the movie industry has been woefully lacking in the last few years. The story gently reels you in until you almost look at their story as your own, a memory being perfectly played out they way you wish it happened to you.Then comes the picture perfect casting, where I was compelled instantly by the innocence of Joel Courtney (as Joe Lamb), who is the first young actor since Patrick Fugit in Almost Famous to truly capture that wide- eyed stare into the possible purity of the future. Another factor connecting the audience to Courtney was our shared need to care for and protect the young damsel in distress, Elle Fanning (playing Alice Dainard). Fanning is the epitome of the first girl we all fell in love with in elementary school and she holds the audience in the palm of her hand throughout every scene. Not to be outdone, Riley Griffiths (playing Charles, the young film director), taps into the other side of the coin, the best friend who always wanted to be the hero, but never quite made it to center stage.Behind the camera, Abrams and Spielberg may have just cemented themselves as the ultimate dynamic duo. Spielberg is still a legend in Hollywood and has incredibly well tuned story senses, but some of his recent efforts (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, War of the Worlds) have been slightly off from his previous greatness. Abrams, on the other hand, is still a relative newcomer to the big screen (only directing Mission Impossible III and Star Trek), but has proved himself a near master of the current form, grown on the sensibilities of a changing and ever adapting crowd. Abrams took this story and crafted it into a beautiful homage to the man sitting right next to him. Super 8 is a throwback to Spielberg's younger days, giving a whole new generation of movie watchers a glimpse into what others grew up with in the late 70's and early 80's. The balance of character development, action sequences and well-paced comedy beats really gives this film a perfect blend for nearly every audience member.The End of the Page recommendation: Super 8 is a perfectly crafted summer blockbuster. It just doesn't get better, at least not this year.",10,3,7,17 June 2011
Looper," Let's agree to disagree (with myself)
","First thing, if you haven't seen Brick, stop reading this and go watch it. If you have seen Brick, stop reading this and go watch it again. Great, now that you're back, you're welcome and let's continue.Looper is the third film from writer/director Rian Johnson, who blasted onto the indie filmmaking scene with the aforementioned Brick, creating an instant stir and a huge level of expectation for future projects. He followed it up with The Brothers Bloom, a quirky and more humorously emotional film than his debut. Four years later, we finally get the next volume in Johnson's catalog, and many of us have been waiting with baited breath.Looper is a sci-fi time travel tale about an assassin in the not-too- distant future who kills people sent back to him from the slightly-more- distant future. This cold-blooded killer, Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is known as a Looper, and he knows one day the person sent back to die will be himself, thereby closing the loop. Yet when faced with the older version of Joe (Bruce Willis), the present-day version fails to get the job done and begins a harrowing chase to settle the score and figure out why the future version of him wants to live so badly.The description is above is fully accurate, but it leaves out a huge plot point in the story because it's a spoiler. So if you don't want to know any more about the film, stop here and come back when you've seen it for yourself.OK, now that you've been warned (SPOILERS AHEAD, second and last warning) here's the rest. Willis comes back hunting for a mythical mobster from the future called The Rainmaker, who in his time period is closing all the loops en masse. He is also partially responsible for killing Willis' future wife, something Willis is determined to fix in the past by finding and killing The Rainmaker as a child.The biggest problem with Looper overall is both plot descriptions are true, but they could be entire movies on their own. Tied together into one script the balance between the two is shaky. For the first half of the movie it is nearly all about Levitt versus Willis in a game of cat and mouse, all while trying to avoid the present-day mafia who are trying to kill them both. Yet somewhere around the halfway mark, the movie slows down considerably while we dive into the deep end of the pool with the Rainmaker storyline, with added performances from Emily Blunt and Pierce Gagnon on a random stretch of farmland.Script issues aside, there is always going to be a debate on the topic of time travel and how it plays out in the film. In this realm, Johnson tosses the logic and technology of it out the window with pleasant abandon, even having Willis yell out in a critical scene, 'It doesn't matter!' For me it was a nice touch and should be heeded by future filmmakers who dare to use time travel as a plot device. Don't get bogged down in the details of how it works (because in the end, it doesn't).The performances are also worth mentioning here with a special nod to the makeup department. Levitt underwent a truly amazing and subtle transformation into a younger version of Willis, and it definitely had an effect on not only how he played the character, but how the audience reacts to him. Levitt is reaching a level of star status that will soon overcome his on-screen characters because we will all know exactly who he is (currently known as the Tom Cruise effect), but with the slight manipulation of Levitt's face, it was almost hard to remember it was actually him on screen. He delivered the same quality and intensity we have become accustomed to, and that helps buoy the film during the slower portions. Also, Pierce Gagnon is incredibly intense for such a young kid. Keep an eye on him if they ever do another sequel to the Children of the Corn franchise. He'd be a shoe-in.In an overall look back, there is a moral question that pervades the film and strains to link the two stories, but both weren't necessary to answer it and a strong choice as to what the film was really about would have simplified it and delivered a much stronger final product.",6,3,10,3 October 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Some Things Never Change
","I'm going to commit what to many will seem like film geek treason, I will now connect Michael Bay and Terrence Malick into one theory of filmmaking.Yep, deal with it.Malick and Bay share one important thing and that is a completely unabashed tunnelvision for the type of film they want, damn the naysayers, critics and crowds. They both make movies mainly for themselves and in truth, there is nothing wrong with that. As an audience member you need to know going in exactly what you are going to get. It is the only way to really enjoy anything that falls from the cameras of these two (and some other notables). With that said, let's dive headlong into the metallic masterpiece of summertime popcorn, Transformers!Transformers: Dark of the Moon continues the story of Sam Witwicky and his Autobot friends. While Sam struggles to gain a purpose in life outside of Decepticon attacks, the Autobots are off helping the government on secret missions. Then everything is torn apart by the discovery of the original Autobot escape ship, known as The Ark, and the captain of that ship, Sentinel Prime. He alone holds the key to technology that could either help reshape the Transformers home world or completely destroy ours. The Decepticons, completely aware of this discovery, make an immediate power play and the war is back, bigger than ever.Kids buying the Transformer toys today only want one thing, huge robots in spectacular 3D slow motion destroying each other and every building in sight. From this narrow viewpoint, Bay delivers in bulk. The highway fight sequence brought back memories of other high-speed terror scenes like in Matrix Reloaded and The Island (maybe a little too reminiscent of that last one according to some eagle eyed movie nerds). Since Bay actually filmed these scenes in the latest and greatest 3D technology, it was admittedly pretty amazing to watch. In other scenes, some of the CGI was so intensely crisp that it actually started popping too far from the live footage, making it stand out, which ruins a little of the illusion.So the special effects is where it was at. Big robots, big explosions, big buildings falling down. Those were the high points.The low points were pretty much everything else.Standing in the center of all the toys-on-roids insanity is Shia LaBeouf, who in my opinion is a really good actor banking inside really bad movies. I can't fault him for taking parts in some of the biggest franchises in movie history (Transformers and Indiana Jones) because the exposure and paycheck are nearly impossible to pass up, but in terms of showing his skills as an actor, those hefty titles have done him nothing but a painful disservice. He made his big splash on the scene in the Disney TV show Even Stevens and then on the big screen in the Rear Window update, Disturbia. Many people also don't remember one of my personal favorite performances in the Project Greenlight-sponsored film, The Battle of Shaker Heights. Shia has the chops, but gets surrounded by weak emotional performances, both from CGI and real people. In this outing, Megan Fox's eye candy character was replaced by Victoria Secret's model (and current Jason Statham girlfriend), Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Whiteley was an improvement in sense of acting ability, but the part was written levels below what Fox was given. The original love interest had layers, depth and some edge, while Whiteley was given virtually no background, no emotional outlet and nothing to do but stand there and be hot. Sure, the 12-year old in the audience doesn't want or need more, but to them I say, 'Go grab a Victoria Secret's catalog from your parent's bathroom and stay out of my movie.'Beyond the magical pair of leads, Bay brings back the regular tough guys, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson, to keep on keeping on. They both do fine jobs and don't try to make this more than it is. Coming in for the first time in the franchise is Frances McDormand, an Academy Award winner to class up the joint. While she was amusing and brought a little more skill to the screen, her part was borderline over-the-top, even in a movie with three story tall robots, because she had to balance out John Tuturro who drifts somewhere off to Hunter S. Thompson land. As if they weren't enough, Bay decides to bring in an unusual amount of big name cameos, including John Malkovich (who does a decent job in his few scenes) and Ken Jeong (who seems to be acting in a completely different movie, possibly thinks he's filming Hangover 3). I saved the best for last though, my personal favorite and the only person I was actually thrilled to see appear on screen, Alan Tudyk (who plays Tuturo's assistant/bodyguard). Tudyk is a cult TV and film legend to his legions of fans spanning from the days of Firefly, Dollhouse and other projects not created by Joss Wheedon. Tudyk was the one person I actually cheered form when he magically appeared on screen.I could go into a section now where I talk about the story, the plot lines, the connective tissue of the writing, but in reality, Bay didn't really care and neither do the younger members of the crowd, so let's just skip it.The End of the Page recommendation: Transformers: Dark of the Moon starts slow, goes out with a bang and delivers surface entertainment for the middle school crowd.",3,274,437,8 July 2011
