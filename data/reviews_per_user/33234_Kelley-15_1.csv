The Blair Witch Project," Kept my interest, but left me needing to know more!!!!!!!
","The BlairWitch Project- is this movie for real? I thought this was a true story?I enjoyed the film,only I was left feeling very unsatisfied.I thought it to be interesting enough that I wanted and want  to know WHAT HAPPENED to Heather, Joshua and Mike???????Was this a true documentary that three students lost their lives over? Or is this an actual film created to leave the viewers guessing??????!!!!!Is there even a town called Burkittsville? Is there a real BlairWitch legend at all?Well, if there is any real truth to the BlairWitch Project, I would greatly appreciate that information!?!Thanks!",6,0,0,9 August 1999
