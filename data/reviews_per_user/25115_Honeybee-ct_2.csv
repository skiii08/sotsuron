The Sound of Music," The use of Imagery
","The beginning of the movie shows beautiful scenery of lakes, hills and greenery, which creates a sense of peace and tranquility. The panoramic views of mountains and hills are done on purpose for the author to set a scene. The blues lead to feelings of tranquility and peace, whilst the greens give an enriching feeling of life. The opening scenes create such beauty, and the styles of houses that are shown clearly dictate the wealth of the area. This is quite a contrast to the modest girl, singing with such an angelic voice, whose clothing does not show wealth, but modesty and simplicity. She is on her own in these beautiful hills, leading the viewers to believe she may want to escape and that she may be a solitary person...this movie is an absolute must to watch, rich with history, emotion and social privilege.",10,2,2,19 November 2015
When Harry Met Sally...," Classic 1989 Romantic Comedy
","When Harry met Sally is a classic 1989 Romantic comedy. We are introduced to Harry, and he is blowing off steam by hitting baseballs. When we see Harry with Sally later we understand the dynamic of what is going on between these two characters. Sally is wild and free, which is portrayed by her crazy hair and the fact that she fakes an orgasm in the middle of restaurant and doesn't give a damn about who is watching, just to prove her point to Harry, my kind of person! Sally speaks up against him and his nonsense, they become almost equals which changes their dynamics and eventually makes them realise that they are perfect for each other. This is a classic romantic comedy with great humour at many points in the film!",8,2,2,19 November 2015
