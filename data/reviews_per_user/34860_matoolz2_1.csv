The Blair Witch Project," at least we got 'The Bare Wench Project' out of it...
","People either love this movie and proclaim it as the scariest movie ever made or hate it, there is no in between. Personally, I thought it was a piece of garbage. I looked forward to seeing this movie for months (they did a great job of promoting this film, to bad they did`nt deliver) and went to see it 3 days after it opened. What a disappointment, I saw absolutely nothing in this turkey that was frightening in the least. Three students, making a documentary in the woods get lost and hear noises at night outside their tent at which point they take off running through the woods screaming (whoo...that`s really scary). I think the guy 2 rows behind me, at the theater, summed it up pretty well when he said, after the movie was over, 'I thought this was supposed to be scary'. If they were giving this movie away at my local video store, I would`nt touch it with a ten foot pole.",1,2,4,22 June 2001
