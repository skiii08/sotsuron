Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I almost forgot to blink, breathe
","This movie is one of the absolute best movies I have ever seen.  The story line is well put, and makes sense.  The special effects are spectacular. I almost didn't blink during the movie, for fear of missing anything!!  In this movie, there is a lot of hidden information that reveals a lot about movies 4, 5, and 6. To find this info. you must 'read between the lines', so to speak. The info. is quite rewarding though.  My congratulations to George Lucas for another excellent movie. The soundtrack for the movie is flawless and complements every sceen perfectly.  My congratulations to the composer and conducter of the Star Wars music, John Williams, as well as the London Symphony Orchestra for their superb talent. I definitely recomend this movie to anyone and everyone.",10,0,1,25 May 1999
