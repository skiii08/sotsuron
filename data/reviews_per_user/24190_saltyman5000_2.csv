Hereditary," Don't watch this abomination!
","Dull, boring, non scary piece of trash. It's a film that doesn't understand what it's point is. I was sat in the cinema, believing the hype and was ready to be terrified of the movie deemed as 'scary as the exorcist'. Lol The film starts with the death of the protagonists mother, who lived in with the rest of her family; her husband, eldest son and daughter. We observe how the family copes with the passing and how they all don't really feel anything for her. We then get sucked into how the grandma lived a peculiar life, only to be pulled straight back into the non grief that the family are experiencing. Another death occurs, more grief, more family blame and emotional break downs for 1 hour 40 minutes to be precise. Then the movie takes a dark turn when the mother believes she is a medium and summons one of the family members back through a seance. The summoned family member then chooses a host and begins to terrorise the family in order to carry out the passing grand mother's grand scheme, which was to summon a demon called, who gives a sh**. The ending is so underwhelming and unscary that the entire cinema laughed. I was very close to walking out, but had to stay just to see how this monstrosity of a film came to it's non conclusion. We witness grief and then non grief. More grief and then it turns into a family drama. Then for the remaining 15 minutes it attempts to be a horror film, which is about as scary as finding faeces in Your white briefs. Do not watch this film, save your money boys and girls.",1,13,30,16 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Yet another blockbuster money maker, with little story telling and substance
","I find it difficult in where to begin with this abomination, as there is so much to comment on and IMDb only allow 1,000 words. I could write a better trilogy of books as to what is wrong with this film and why you should avoid it. So I found myself, sat with my family, ready to be blown away by the next Star Wars instalment. The opening credits roll. I think to myself 'oooo this looks like it's going to be good'. Little did I know. Within 15 minutes I found myself fidgety and incredibly infuriated at Daisy Ridleys dreadful overacting. A lot has happened since Return of the Jedi, 30 years in fact. So little is described as to what has gone on that it is kind of just skimmed over. Luke had a daughter and fled to another planet leaving her behind to fend for herself. Han Solo and Leia have a son who was trained by Luke, who for no reason whatsoever decides to turn against Luke, his mother and his father to join the dark side. He wares a mask and has a funny voice for no apparent reason and he has been corrupted by the new dark leader, who is a 25ft Voldemort look a like. All of this and I found myself thinking, why?? Surely the makers of this film wanted to delve into the 30 years building up to this point a bit more. Surely!? As that would save there being so many holes in this plot, even if you can call it that. The two new protagonists were miscast and their acting turned me off. Why would Luke Skywalker's daughter speak perfect English, RP to be precise, when her father clearly has an American accent and raised her until she was around at least 7, before deciding to leave her on her own. This is just awful attention to detail by everyone who was apart of this film. All the audience was left with in the end, those who actually sat back and thought about what they were seeing, was action after action, with no explanation. Why can Rae fly the millennium falcon better than Han Solo and know all the ins and outs of its structure? Why would she pick up a light sabre and defeat a very well trained Jedi, one who was trained by her father, possibly the greatest Jedi who ever lived, having never previously held one in her life. The ending is laughable. The dialogue is cheesy and full of punchlines that were so unfunny, it made me question the meaning of life. The bits of action in the film were short and underwhelming. It's films like this, money making machines not intending to be pieces of art, that make me question film making in its entirety. I am truly gutted my family spent hard earned money on this dreadful, ghastly picture and I would like a full refund.",1,49,59,5 January 2016
