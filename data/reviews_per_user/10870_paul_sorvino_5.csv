The Devil's Advocate," Stunning!!!
","I must begin by quoting other users by saying it's a shame the rating isn't higher.I am giving the reasons but only after saying that it's a shame to spoil your pleasure of seeing it, so no comments on the synopsis.First of all, the leading actors are remarkable... Al Pacino should have won the Oscar for his part, but let us not forget Keanu Reeves. HE CAN PLAY! And he is most convincing, too.As for the two lovely ladies, Connie Nielsen and Charlize Theron (in strictly alphabetical order) are perfectly chosen and also playing beautifully.On the other hand, the production design (oh, and also the music) create the perfect atmosphere of a perfectly shot movie, a movie transcending the genre (horror) and sliding beautifully in the hardest genre to express: drama.To conclude, Al Pacino really shows something we all know: he is one of the greatest there is! Enjoy!",10,1,1,25 September 2009
Memento," Why not 10 stars???
","Indeed, why not??? I mean, regardless of the editing, which will be in the future looked upon with appreciation and jealousy, the movie is absolutely stunning...Guy Pearce makes, as usual, the audience believe his feelings are genuine. He is able to transmit to the people watching every bit of anxiety, lack of trust and desire for the truth his character feels, doing it in a manner making you want to see the movie again and again.THE MAIN QUESTION is: what if the movie were edited in the 'traditional' manner? Would it have been less appealing? Well, it's a hard question to answer.Mainly because the editing goes strictly linked to the title and the condition of the leading character, but also helps you in a very subtle manner to transcend from the position of viewer to the one of a character in the movie... It helps you identify to the character and beyond...Maybe a slight reminder of the 'Fugitive' theme, that only makes one appreciate both these films...As for the cast, it is a work of genius. There are so many angles that could be debated here! Beginning with the talent Guy Pearce shows when playing roles of people with very troubled minds and lives, one can only speculate the very interesting idea of bringing 2 of the stars of the first installment of 'Matrix' around for another challenging movie.Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano really make even here a great team. Their characters have quite the same 'talent' of apeearing to be 'good' people, but being in fact very cool, calculated manipulators of people. They do prey on the leading characters 'disability' and they do it in a very effective manner, until a certain point.Why 'disability'? Well, because even the character played by Guy Pearce uses it as a weapon of some sorts and at the 'end' of the film we see to what effect.What can I say besides: Enjoy!",10,0,2,27 September 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Drag me out of the theater...
","Well, way to go, Sam Raimi! Just another stew of comedy, horror and fantasy to keep from going to sleep... Because this one is the only two reasons for the 3 stars... It really woke me up... But it only got 45 minutes or so of my time to see it...The story isn't quite new (sic!) or even good. The special effects are quite good though, but that's about it.Here are some of the reasons for the 7 stars I couldn't give it, formulated as questions: 1. As we all very well know, we are taught to be sharp, tough and relentless in pursuit of the final goal: MONEY. So why the attack on the bank? Aren't they the ones that circulate the money and make the world economy spin? 2. The gypsy theme is to be debated and not neglected (as the gypsy wins in the end...). Come to think of it, is this flick a propaganda for them? 3. Alison Lohman is clearly unconvincing in this role... He just isn't cute enough for the beginning, and at the same time not being able to gather empathy for the public. Or is she? 4. I really understand the combination between the horror and the comedy. But the sauce produced here is just not mixed enough...5. Tom Holland's 'Thinner' with Robert John Burke was a little more convincing...",3,0,3,24 September 2009
Up," Brilliant only if you have a high-contrast TV...
","I will only give this movie 3/10 for the brilliant (sic!) engineering behind it, that is the tech department.As for the story, well it puzzles and annoys me: 1. Is there a need EVERY time for a conflict? Maybe so, but let's face it: what is the real target speaking of the public??? 2. I recognize the need for the ecological theme, but I really resent the advertisement for chocolate...3. I'm really annoyed because of the child's obesity: for the old man to be obese is quite easy to understand, but the recurrent obese child theme must not be neglected...",3,4,10,24 September 2009
Heat," Brilliant, but that's just the half of it !
","Well, first of all, I can't, won't and shouldn't spoil the pleasure of viewing this masterpiece. Although the story isn't quite new, the thing is that the VIEW is quite interesting. But that's enough said about that.Looking at it objectively (hard as it is...) one should have difficulty in 'choosing' the side of the role receiving more sympathy. Will it be Pacino or De Niro? To be honest, I can say: you can't...The both of them play beautifully, not forgetting Val Kilmer or a very blond Ashley Judd... But all in all it's not only the cast that makes this s great movie...Is it a thriller? Is it an action movie? Is it a drama? You can only say YES to all of these questions. It is a great movie to watch, to comment, to think about it and let's face it: there are more than one subjects to debate on: 1. Traditional approach to one of the most dangerous jobs: that of a cop. Is it enough to be a good cop to catch a thief? 2. Is the line between 'cops and robbers' clearly drawn thinking of the prejudice that the first are good and the latter are bad? 3. Every man or woman portrayed in this movie has a hard shell, projecting a certain image and also a soft core, with deep feelings, frustration etc. i.e. everything that makes us human...Enjoy this perfect movie and you will all have your own themes to think about...",10,4,8,26 September 2009
