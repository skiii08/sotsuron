The Ring," Tepid remake of Japanese horror film
","Definitely underwhelming, due apparently to post-production cuts that sanitized and gelded an otherwise worthy effort. Apparently test audiences were disturbed by original footage, so much of the horror of the movie was removed from fear of offending milquetoast viewers. Disturbing sequences were watered down to movie of the week quality. What's left is a muddy, aimless, sometimes startling derivative of a first-rate Japanese production. Try 'Mothman Prophesies' or the original 'Ring' for a better ride. Note to producers: stay in the offices down the hall from the accountants and let moviemakers do what they do best. If the director/editor has created something that disturbs test audiences, don't panic and water down the flick. Scaring audiences is what horror movies are SUPPOSED to do.",Null,1,2,11 November 2002
