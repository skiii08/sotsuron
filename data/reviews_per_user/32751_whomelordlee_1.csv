Scarface," Best gangster film ever? i think so
","I have long been into gangster films but it was only recently that I saw Scarface for the first time. Before seeing the film I would have given Mario Puzo's 6 hour epic the last Don ten out of ten but by the time Brian De Palma's credits rolled it seemed a mere run of the mill flick. Al Pacino is simply awesome as the ruthless yet affable anti-hero Tony Montana and is given more than equally impressive support by both Steven Bauer and Robert Loggia. Blend this with both the beauty and obvious talents of Mary Elizabeth Monasterio and Michelle Phifer and a complete masterpiece could have been the only outcome. Having seen Brian De Palmas other great gangster work, The Untouchables I was of the mindset that it could not have been matched; nearly three hours later I was left to eat my words as the tale of the cuban 'political prisoner' unravelled amongst the backdrop of the Miami underword. My only criticism of the film would be the ending; I was left screaming at the TV for Montana to look behind him as the hit-man approached. Despite this Scarface has easily become one of the best films I have ever seen and I could easily watch it once a week for the next ten years without becoming bored with it.",10,0,1,2 October 2006
