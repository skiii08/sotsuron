Hereditary," Well-acted, atmospheric... with an incredibly stupid ending
","My girlfriend and I were tense several times during the final 30 minutes... until the ending was revealed. We felt relieved of all our fear. Terrific performances, an interesting moody gloomy aura to it... and an ending that will scare exactly no one. Wait for it on streaming. Save your money.",4,0,2,23 June 2018
