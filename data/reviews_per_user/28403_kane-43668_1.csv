First Man," Good, well made but simply dull.
","I found this a well made and interesting film, somewhat more like a documentary than an entertainment. Being the first human to walk on the moon was the most fascinating and exhilarating subject possible but they made it all seem rather dull and irrelevant. A good documentary on Neil Armstrong but a dull film about the greatest single achievement in all human history.",5,0,1,12 March 2019
