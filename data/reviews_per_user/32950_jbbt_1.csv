Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Stupid movie.... Not!!!!!!!
","Hilarious movie, one of the funniest movies ever made. Anyone who was offended or gave this movie a 1/10 is a prude and an idiot! Get a life and learn how to laugh when someone is being offensive for comedic purposes. Sasha Baron Cohen is extremely brilliant how he dupes everyone, no wonder everyone tried to sue him after the movie came out. The part with comedy coach and the naked fight with Azamat are two of the funniest scenes of the film. The DVD has a bunch of funny deleted scenes too, not the typical lame extra stuff most DVD's have. Borat gets a massage from a male masseuse and asks for a happy ending and he tries to adopt a dog for the purpose of having sex with it and eating of it gets old. Great movie!",8,2,2,13 January 2016
