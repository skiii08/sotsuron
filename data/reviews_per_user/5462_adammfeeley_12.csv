The Avengers," A lovable classic marvel action film!
","The avengers is a classic marvel movie full of action, stunning special effects and the odd bit of funny humour. I think Age of Ultron will be better but this is still a fun and enjoyable film. I love how it appeals to everyone not just comic book fans. I can't find any flaws in this movie , it kinda has everything you need in a good movie:action, comedy, cool quotes and stunning special effects. I also love how marvel did movies before this one so the characters could be developed. The casting choices were also great. Everyone fits perfectly as the character they were chosen to play. Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron Man and Scarlett Johannson is amazing as Black Widow. My favourite is Samuel L Jackson as the tough but amazing Nick Fury. All in all WATCH THIS FILM.",9,12,19,11 April 2015
The Terminator," Game changer for the genre
","I had heard good things about this movie and I believe good dosen't do the film justice. The story line is so original and it has the perfect blend of action and story. It focuses on Sarah Connor, a woman who will give birth to the future resistance leader of the human race, as she is hunted by a robotic cyborg who has been sent from the future to kill her. She is also protected by a human called Reese who has also been sent from the future. The story is so unique and all the actors are amazing. The fight and action sequences are perfectly shot. Despite some people saying the CGI would be laughable but for the time it was released it was groundbreaking. The standout is Arnold Schawzneger who shines as the tough, emotionless cyborg. I love this movie and it is a standout of the science fiction genre.",9,0,0,4 June 2015
Silver Linings Playbook," Loved it!
","This film is an excellent look at life with bi-polar disorder and love. It focuses around a man who is released form the hospital and he aims to get his life back on track. His father(Rober De Nero) wants him to try to be part of the family again but he pushed him too far. Pat(Bradely Cooper) then meets Tiffany the crazy woman who husband has just died. the two fall for each other and enter a dance competition. Tiffany is played by Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar for her performance, is dark and hilarious at times. The film does deal with the disease in a serious way but does add in laughter to make sure the viewer dosen't end up in tears. The whole cast shine and the film was nominated for 8 Osacrs in total.",10,0,3,25 May 2015
Saving Private Ryan," One of the best war films ever made.
",This film is an absolute masterpiece. It shows that war isn't always glamorous. Steven Spielberg won a Best Directing Oscar for his work on this film and the film went on to win four others. It is gritty and bloody and it shows that wars aren't won by weapons but by soldiers. The cast shine as the group of soldiers tasked with finding Private Ryan. Along the way they encounter the harsh truth and real meaning of war. It boasts impressive battle sequences and the stylish cinematography makes the film truly beautiful. The opening beach sequence is possibly the greatest opening scenes in movies. Tom Hanks is spell binding as the commander who has no idea about the harsh truth of war. Overall a truly amazing film.,10,15,22,12 May 2015
The Hurt Locker," Excellent Modern War Movie
",The Hurt Locker is a great retelling of modern war. It focuses around a new bomb disposal man and his team in Iraq. It displays the struggle and horrors they face and just how brutal life in the front line is. Obviously it isn't as good as Saving Private Ryan but it is still a gripping retelling of war. The cast shine especially Jeremy Renner who plays the main character. The director (Kaythrn Bigellow) shines in directing the film and she became the first female director to win an Oscar. The film also picked up 5 other Oscars including Best Picture. It shows how harsh the conditions were in Iraq. There is one scene where they find a boy who has been kidnapped and has had a pack of explosives put inside of him. It is at times gripping and at times disturbing but always great.,9,1,2,24 May 2015
Jurassic World," Fun enjoyable clich√©s.
","The reason I enjoyed this film so much is the fact it is the same as the first Jurassic Park, with better visuals. Yes it's predictable but that is the beauty of it. The fact the previous sequels flopped is that they strayed from its source material. This movie goes back to the original. The visuals are great and the cast is brilliant. Chris Pratt continues to outdo himself. The plot focuses on a new hybrid dinosaur revealed at Jurassic World. Disaster strikes when it escapes and Chris Pratt is forced to capture him. It sounds like any old movie of hunt and kill but it weirdly grows on you. The acting, visuals and unforgettable theme song could be it. Anyway, fun enjoyable not as good as the first but definitely surpasses the two sequels!",9,2,7,27 June 2015
The Dark Knight," One of the best films ever made.
","I LOVE THIS FILM AND FOR GOOD REASONS. This superhero film redefined the genre. It proves that superhero films don't have to be full of cheesy send off lines and spandex. Heath Leger won an Oscar for his raw and gritty portrayal of the Joker. The rest of the A list cast also shine including Christian Bale as Batman, Michael Caine as Alfred and Gary Oldman as Gordon. Director Christopher Nolan definitely outdid himself with this film. I also loved the fact he killed of Batman's girl. This proves that the guy dosen't always have to get the girl. The cinematography is perfect and the dialogue is perfect. The film was nominated for 6 Oscars and won 2 and it was the first superhero film to win a mainstream Oscar.",10,0,1,12 May 2015
Jaws," Will go down in history
","Jaws is iconic in a number of ways. It was the first summer blockbuster and it is still a classic suspense film. The thing that makes this film so good is the characters feel human. There isn't a hero or funny guy they are all just normal people hunting a shark. You can relate to the characters and feel for them. For the time the effects are wonderful and the scenery is amazing. Some scenes are gruesome but the thing that makes the film better is the haunting, iconic soundtrack. It just lifts the film from good to greatness. Steven Spielberg truly made a name for himself from this film. The concept has been imitated but has obviously never been matched. It brings us a rememberale theme turn, a haunting villain and an array of real human characters.",10,3,6,27 June 2015
Inception," At times confusing but still amazing.
","This film is a complex, visually striking and beautiful masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. What i love about Nolan's films is the complexity of them. He is able to take such interesting and diverse ideas and he is able to put them on the big screen. The visual effects are amazing and so is the sound and cinematography. This is why that Inception managed to sweep the artistic categories at almost every award show. It won four Oscars for cinematography, sound editing, sound mixing and visual effects. What is was disappointed by was the fact the acting didn't get any nominations. The whole cast was captivating and the standout was Joseph Gordon Levitt. The only negative thing I have to say about this film is maybe it's too complex. Now this maybe be because I was only 13 when I watched it but at times I found it very hard to focus on. Anyway, a visually amazing film and a beautiful masterpiece.",9,0,3,15 June 2015
Pitch Perfect," Surprisingly funny and fun
","When I decided to watch this with my cousins(who are all girls) I thought it would just be some dumb chic flick girl musical type thing. But damn was I wrong. This movie is hilarious and the musical numbers are amazing. The cast all shine but the top prize definitely goes to Rebel Wilsons Fat Amy who steals every scene. The movie focuses on a girl called Becca(expertly played by Anna Kendrick) as she starts her life in college. She reluctantly joins the all girl occepela group, The Barden Bellas, as they try to claim their title. The song sequences are awesome and the jokes are really funny. The entire cast shine. I think what makes the film so funny is the diversity of the Bellas. There is the lesbian, the fat one, the slut, the control freak, the rebel and the goofy quiet one. Basically it is a funny musical and I hope the sequel is just as good as this!",9,1,3,25 May 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A great sequel
","I don't get why this film is receiving so much hate. It is a sequel that is better than the original. The new director definitely helps the franchise. The whole cast shines: Jennifer Lawrence is great as feisty Katniss, Woddy Harrelson is superb as drunk Haymitch and Elizabeth Banks is superb as the eccentric Effie. The special effects are superb and I especially the arty kind of effect when you see the arena for the first time. The only negative thing I wouuld have to say would be the slightly fast and the cliffhanger like ending which makes you scream for the next one. It is a great sequel and it surpasses the original because the first on e was slightly disappointing. The outfits and costume design is amazing and Donald Sutherland is mesmerising as the calculating as President Snow.",10,5,18,24 May 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Better get Oscar Nominations of plenty.
","This film in simple terms was amazing. It was a non stop action thrill ride. The fight scenes were so fluid and easy to follow and the imagery was fantastic.l I also loved the range of characters George Miller has created. Furiosa was by far my favourite she was just a pure bad ass. But I loved how everyone in this movies got an awesome moment, even the bad guys got an awesome moment. The plot follows on from a nuclear holocaust, the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed. Max Rockatansky, a survivor, is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe, and taken to Joe's Citadel. Designated a universal blood donor, Max is imprisoned and used as a 'blood bag' for the sick War Boy Nux. Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa, one of Joe's lieutenants, is sent in her armored truck to collect gasoline. When she drives off-route, Joe realizes that his five wives are missing. Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and the Bullet Farm. The action is mad, beautiful and actually tiring to watch. This better get the all important Best Picture nomination and maybe a few acting nods for Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron.",10,0,12,2 August 2015
