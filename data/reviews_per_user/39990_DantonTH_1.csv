Lucky Number Slevin," Come on, no more Tarantino-wanna-be...
","Yes, this is not that bad movie but it still is...I try to describe it as short form as I am able; What comes if Tarantino and Richie makes a baby... that Born's 2 months too early...?; This movie just suck'd. Why? It has too strong taste of that Tarantino/Richie (cool guys, different-colorful-gangsters, twist in the end, almost-smart-lines, funny bad guys etc etc etc etc ) type of movie.Tarantino made his smart-ass movies and so did guy Ritchie (that was OK still), but come on! It has now more than ten years later. No more this kind of movies. create something new. Please. Only thing that was good was acting.",5,3,6,4 March 2010
