Antz," Kids film, definitely
","Although the animation in the film is great (though now surpassed by films like Shrek and Final Fantasy), it will not hold up all the way through, if you are over 12. It's worth watching for a while as it is very well done, but the plot and jokes run a little thin. Great film to rent for the kids, or maybe watch it if it's on TV anyway just for the cast/voice actors (including Sharon Stone, Woody Allen, Sly Stallone).",5,1,1,27 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Stunning
","This was absolutely one of the best films of the year. Many compared it (before it's release) to Harry Potter, which does not do it justice in the least. Harry Potter is a kids film, it will be forgotten in a years time. The Fellowship of the Ring will live on in our memories for a good long time still.It should be up in the list along with the likes of Star Wars, the acting was brilliant, the visual effects stunning, and the story a timeless classic. It has done the book justice and I am very glad to see Peter Jackson taking up this task. No Hollywood director could have pulled it off this well. I shudder at the thought of Steven Spielberg, Roland Emmerich or Joel Schumacher would have done to it. Well done Jackson, it really shines through that you are a big Tolkien fan, and you have inspired many to finally pick up the novels and read them for themselves. Well done.",10,0,0,21 December 2001
