Skyfall," Average Bond!
","Some have praised this as the best, others have slated it as the worst. Personally, I find it somewhere in between.The plot is fine, but pretty straightforward and nothing new. Some really good scenes, but some weak ones too.The movie starts off strong, but gradually takes a bit of a nosedive into the second act and the pace drops from the adrenaline action of the opening scene to really sleepy scenes with not much to keep you going. The non action scenes in the second act have dry dialogue and don't really keep the attention. The arrival at Skyfall helps to pick things up a bit and has a wild west feel to it but I can't help feel that overall, they missed the mark here. It just doesn't feel like a Bond movie.Also, why did they wait 3 movies in to introduce Moneypenny and Q? They should have been brought into the fold sooner and could have been more established now. Instead of being key in helping Bond albeit in smaller roles, they seem more like bit part characters and what they add to the movie could have been provided by any character in the story.",7,0,0,4 June 2020
John Wick," Action packed and that's all
","Lots of action scenes, some executed beautifully but no story, no character development, very little dialogue for Keanu (okay, maybe that's a good thing), no plot.What's the point of the little videos of his wife and telling us she's dead without explaining the how our the why. Surely if she was killed, he'd be more concerned with avenging her than his car and the dog he had for 2 days? Might as well have written him as a bachelor.The policeman turns up at his door after he kills 12 men in his house, the police officer sees the bodies and the blood on his face, but it's okay because he's John Wick.Supposedly, he's the top hit man but we don't see him working, just getting revenge.",6,0,2,13 May 2019
Terminator Salvation," Salvation of a franchise?
","I feel that this movie gets slated more than it should. It is a very flawed movie, but not terrible. Much better than T3 and the atrocious Genysis.Firstly, Bale seems to get a lot of stick, yet I think he's more believable as an older version of Furlong's Connor than Stahl was.I like the darker tone in this one, as opposed to the lame jokes thrown into T3 for the sake of it.The scenes with the T-800 are a joy to watch, as well.However, like many movies these days, this is full of plot holes and conflicting plot lines, and I think the character of Marcus is absolutely pointless, and like another reviewer stated, it capped all over what James Cameron did. According to the movie, Marcus died in 2003, so I'm assuming he was made part machine while is corpse was still 'fresh'. He's a far superior model of the T-800 which was built later in the timeline, it makes so sense. Even removing his character, the same story could have been told. Same goes for Dr Kogan. No explanation to the character but suddenly she's the face of Skynet? Why her? All we know is that she's a doctor and cancer victim, but she becomes the mother of the Terminators.All in all, a decent action movie, which could have been better with a bit more thought given to the characters and the plot.",6,0,0,13 June 2020
Aquaman," Brainless fun!
","I don't often write reviews, but felt like doing one for this.Take this movie with a pinch of salt. If you want a brainless popcorn flick with lots of action, then this is worth a watch. It's visually stunning and the actors try to do their best of a poor script.However, there are many negatives. As usual, DC try to do too much and seem to be in a rush to get as much covered as possible. Aquaman learning his powers should be done in the 1st act, not the 2nd. By this point, it was just assumed he'd learned over time, so no point having his training so late in the movie.The overall tone was all over the place. One minute, it's serious like MOS and BVS, the next it's slap stick like Looney Tunes.Mera was beautifully played by Amber Heard, but there was too much change in the character. She starts off like the Little Mermaid, then progresses to Black Widowesque, then some sort of Jean Grey type character.The movie felt like it tried to take the best bits of the 3 Thor movies (not necessarily a bad thing but would have been nicer to see Aquaman as something different).Overall, not a bad movie but could have been so much better",6,7,13,18 December 2018
The Jungle Book," Company halt!
","I haven't seen this since I was a kid, but still one of my favourite Disney movies.The story itself is pretty simple and straight forward, but enough to keep adults and children interested, but the rest is what makes this really special. The vivid colours, the zany characters and the toe tapping music that you can't help but sing along to, make it very entertaining and there's lots of humour too (more than I remembered).Whilst Sheer Khan's screen time is limited, his presence is felt and thanks to the reputation that precedes him, you already know what to expect by the time he eventually makes his first appearance on screen. One of my favourite Disney villains!",8,0,0,3 July 2020
The Expendables," Carnage!!
","Let's face it, this is a no-brainer action movie, but sometimes that's all a guy wants. Guns, explosions, cool guys with great camaraderie.If you're a fan of the testosterone fueled action movies of the 80s, you'll love this.My 2 favourite scenes, Jason Statham on the basketball court and Terry Crews with the AA-12 are the epitome of what these movies represent!",7,0,0,13 June 2020
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Sizzles without dazzling!
","Okay, when I saw this at the cinema, I loved it, revisiting it again, it's good but not great.Firstly, the cast. Nick Stahl is a terrible actor and is just a whiny wimp, and nobody someone who has been trained his whole life to be a fighter. Claire Danes is likeable but is no Linda Hamilton.Okay, the movie itself. Right off the bat there is a glaring issue. John declared that even though Skynet has been defeated, he hasn't stopped running. Running? You're still in the same city, not that much on the run. You could have went to a different continent, make the terminators work to find you. By sheer coincidence, he happens to go to the vets where a girl from his school happens to work. Also puzzled me that she had no clue who he was, walked away, came back and remembered him.Far too many plot holes and continuity issues throughout the movie, but the action scenes are great and make it enjoyable!",5,0,0,11 June 2020
Quantum of Solace," Quantum of boredom.
","Very weak storyline. A villain with aspirations of World Dominance (Actually, just Bolivia) buying up what appears to be useless land (akin to Lex Luthor in Superman 1978) but it turns out, it's in order to control the water. The Villain wants to control the water of Bolivia (not the oil of most of Europe like King in 'The World is not enough'). This, in itself makes you think, is that it? That's the threat?We have one of the worst Villains in Dominic Greene (up there with Drax on the zero charisma and menace), Merano who wants to be President of Bolivia (only has about 3 scenes and the only thing menacing about him is that he likes to rape).The CIA and British Government now seem content to turn a blind eye to the villains, all is forgiven with Mathis, the Bond girls are 1 dimensional and expendable and Bond just seems to be on a rampage (instead of cool, calm, collected).Really, the only thing I liked about this one was more screen time for Dame Judi Dench who had a lot more to do in this one and brought more to her portrayal of M than she has done in the purvis entries.",5,0,0,3 June 2020
From Dusk Till Dawn," QT and Rodriguez at their best!
","As a teenager, this was the first movie penned by Tarantino that I watched, and it was a great introduction to the filmmaker.Off the bat, this starts like a Tarantino crime movie with everything we've come to love from Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. However, like Pulp Fiction, this is no ordinary crime film and you expect the unexpected. Especially half way through the movie when things kick up a great and it's more like a Rodriguez movie.The movie is a perfect blend of Tarantino writing and Rodriguez visuals, and is an absolute delight from star to finish.The whole cast give a terrific performance, Clooney is electric as Seth (instead of just being himself).
Tarantino is better than expected as the mentally unstable Richie. I also want to mention an issue brought up by a fellow reviewer who seemed to miss the point. He asked if Tarantino thought that the rape in the motel would be funny? No, it's not supposed to be funny. The movie isn't a comedy and that scene in particular shows that Richie has problems, despite appearing to being seemingly normal in the beginning.",9,0,0,18 June 2020
The Mummy Returns," What a disappointment.
","This movie isn't a patch on the original, far too flawed and just pales in comparison.Evy suddenly has past life visions with no explanation as to why she started having them, for a start.Everything in the movie just seems to be convenient.The guy that says that everything is cursed is so irritating that his companions make fun of him too. This isn't a funny shtick, it's just annoying.Alex is annoying as hell, the actor has no talent other than just saying his lines and also, why cast a very blond kid when his parents have darker hair.John Hannah is also more annoying in this one. He comes off more try hard instead of just naturally being funny or shifty.What are the little pygmy monkey type things? Definitely seems like there would have to be some sort of spell uttered for them also.Too many unexplained things happening and the story has no substance.The cgi is another let down. In some scenes it looks good, others it looks absolutely terrible (The Scorpion King looks like a PlayStation 1 character).Rick's tattoo is supposed to be something he's had all is life yet he didn't have it in the first movie, but now it's visible because it's convenient to the story.When Jonathan throws the spear, Imhotep catches it and decides to throw out at the Scorpion King, but then Rick catches it and uses it and more Imhotep is gutted that the Scorpion King is defeated.",5,0,0,4 July 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Has potential but missed the mark.
","I don't often write a review, unless I feel compelled to do so, and this is one of those times.Despite the critical acclaim, took me until 2020 to get around to this. For some reason, it just didn't really appeal to me before.Anyway, the movie was beautifully shot and the acting was terrific, I was pleasantly surprised by Zack GalfianakisGalfianakis in a not mature role.As I started watching this, I thought I'd have loved it and expected a certain type of story, but it didn't deliver. Too many sub plots opened then abandoned instead of being explored, and the whole super powers thing. I get that he played a Superhero in the past, but why did it seem like he had the powers in the real world? Then it seemed like the movie was changing from 'a movie about an actor who played a Superhero' to a Superhero movie (with a scene reminiscent of the battle of New York in Avengers'. At one point I thought, maybe the events were his imagination or a dream, but this wasn't explained.All in all, I found this to be a decent movie to watch if you've got a couple of hours to spare, but not the MUST - SEE it could have been.",6,0,0,24 April 2020
Tarzan," Sub par Disney
","This is pretty poor by Disney standards.I know this is supposed to be an animated feature film, yet the art work looks too 'cartoon' like it was made for Disney Jr or something.I like Phil Collins but his songs in this are so cheesy and pretty terrible.Disney animated movies are always enjoyed by all, but this is so watered down that it feels like the target audience are pre-schoolers and movies like Aladdin feel serious in comparison.The apes stumbling into the camp and suddenly start making music is just so cringey. A 3 year old might find this amusing, but anyone over the age of 9 will probably find it awkward.A poor cash in of the fantastic Tarzan character",4,0,0,4 July 2020
Sin City," A Classic of the comic book genre!
","I loved this movie when it first came out, I bought the graphic novel on holiday in Italy (my 2nd language) and the dvd. However, I haven't seen it in years, and forgot how good it actually is!Visually, this movie is perfect, more so than Kill Bill vol 1, a year earlier. Miller & Rodriguez brought the comics perfectly to life, and the cgi city is eye popping, yet still looks real.Filmed in B&W, gives it an old school noir feel (as well as the narration) with splashes of colour thrown in for emphasises when needed.The story and the characters are reminiscent of the noir crime thrillers, it's Grindhouse, it's VERY comic book, with touches of horror, and Marv's story arc feels like a midieval movie.At times, the dialogue does feel a little jilted on-screen but over all, it's not an issue and doesn't take away from the movie.All in all, this is a beautifully filmed comic book adaptation and is a much watch for anyone who likes the genre and has the stomach to handle the gore!",9,0,0,19 June 2020
Spectre," Blofeld is back!
","Like Skyfall before it, some of the scenes in Spectre are a bit on the show side with the pacing, however, I feel bringing back Spectre adds another dimension to the plot and helps tie in the previous movies as we discover who has orchestrated Craig's Bond movies.The Spectre reunion in Rome was reminiscent of our first encounter with the organisation in 'From Russia with love' albeit a bit more drawn out. It was a nice touch, but felt it could have been shorter or a bit more informative of the organisation, without the pointless whispering bits. The subsequent car chase was decent, but maybe could have had more than just Hinx chase Bond for added excitement and urgent to Bond's escape.The train fight also reminded me of 'From Russia with Love' whilst not as long, Hinx was already known to Bond, so more direct was better.I thoroughly enjoyed the 2nd half of the movie. In my opinion, Waltz is the best Blofeld we've had. If you want a great Blofeld, you can't go wrong with this talented German. He's already shown in his 2 Tarantino characters that he can be cold and calculating yet charming too. A more fleshed out and convincing villain than previous attempts.",8,0,0,4 June 2020
