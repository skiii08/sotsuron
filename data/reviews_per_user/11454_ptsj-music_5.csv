War Dogs," Dead Serious Humor
","It's hard to write a review on this film without also making a spoiler or two, but I'll try hard not to. In stead I'll recommend to check out the true story about Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, but I'm not shore if you should do it before or after watching the biographical fiction version, that is some kind of a comedy. The true story is hilarious, but it's really not at all funny. In the fiction there is one bad and one good guy, though in my beliefs there are no good guys in arms dealing. To avoid the spoiling I won't say who is who, but must warn, if you read the true story, it may be a spoiler any how. The film about the two youngsters getting into hard core arms dealing is made as a black comedy, and because it's based on a real life story, it emerges as dead serious humor at its very best. With steady direction, brilliant acting and a half documentary style both in how camera and locations are used, and also top notch casting in the other roles, the total result is a film and story even Guy Ritchie couldn't match. If so, he would be proud. There are more than one over all issues of moral to the story. First, don't get into something you absolutely can't control and have no experience with. Second, maybe one day you have to discover that even your best friend turns out to be one of your worst enemies - at least if you get in to serious business with big boys and hard cash. Third and most important, war is big business, perhaps the biggest and your government are just as little trustworthy as any other participant in the game, be shore. War Dogs is one of the best black comedies I have seen in years - even though it's not really funny.",8,0,1,4 July 2017

Dallas Buyers Club," Won't get very much better
","Much of the credit for giving this factual based film 9 out of 10 is due to the amazing acting from the leading role man Matthew McConaughey, portraying the aids infected alcohol and sex addict Ron Woodroof in a most convincing way. This part is just perfect for him and one simply forgets that it actually is acting, something that I think rarely happens any more. But perhaps more convincing is the achievement from supporting actor Jared Leto as the transsexual prostitute Rayon. Such a fantastic role performance has to have been awarded somehow. Brilliant, and did he really get that skinny for the part? The rest of the cast all do their jobs very well, but the two mentioned are simply outstanding and take modern method acting to a new level. For once the people in the makeup department really should be honored. The rest of this review is easy. To make such a good film, all people in the cast and crew have done a brilliant job and I always have a big liking for letting the small parts and extras show in the picture. Normal people in films about more or less normal life and society makes any film better. So, my regards to the director, producers and casters. Dallas Buyers Club was recommend to me, and I will certainly pass the recommendation on to others.",7,2,2,19 April 2015
Underground," One Of The Best Films Ever Made!
","I occasionally refer to my personal top 100 list of films. Underground is a true masterpiece and No.2 on that list, only beaten by a somehow underrated, let the also stunning Bad Boy Bubby. I frankly have hard to believe there ever will be produced films of their format anymore, still I hope to be wrong about that. If anyone could do it, it's Underground's director Emir Kusturica.The film is working as a large satiric metaphoric live screen painting of the history of Yugoslavia, and was also made as a tribute during the Balkan War, and a definite anti war epic poem. Not unlike the also brilliant film Goodbye Lenin it's in a manner based on people still believing in the past, that the world hasn't really changed. And in this film their lives are also happening according to the story's title. I will avoid spoilers, but only state that this film creation is only made possible due to Kusturica's genius and taste for the best of Balkan culture. He is working the great lot of amazing, almost unbelievable characters, into a story so wild and full of symbols, it's sometimes hard to breath. The scenography and pictures are more than stunning, and together with crazy choreography and the most vivid Serbian brass music, it all culminates into a higher form of art, beyond normal film and theater. It simply is impossible not to both laugh and cry.If I could give it 12 stars I would, so if you haven't seen Underground, go for it as soon as possible. And get as many as possible to join you. If you didn't like or understand it, try again or I recommend you to quit watching film. Just now I've got a DVD copy and am really looking forward to see it again.",10,1,2,8 November 2017
Logan," Simply A Great Film!
","I didn't even know there was a new film in the X-Men series and went to the cinema to see if there was something watchable. I like the X-men but am sort of the guy who'll stick to the original and think the follow ups are so and so, still this series is ahead of most others. But man, I am glad they made even one more, and I'm even more happy to see a sci-fi /fantasy that's beyond being just a good genre film. This is top notch and perhaps the best in the series. Fantastic to see actors aloud to really act in this type of film and not just show a prototype character, but there is so much more. Everything is well balanced, not to much of anything. I simply forgot about all the digital animation and can still feel the taste of real dust and dirt and some smell of blood. But, most of all, a great pleasure to see a new coming star. Dafne Keen is simply superb. Got nothing more to say - Go And See!",10,3,8,28 March 2017
