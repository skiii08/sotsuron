Blade Runner 2049," Boring, Boring, Boring - and dull
","What a disappointment. From a visually stunning original to a dull and colourless sequel with wooden characters and cheap looking sets and technology. The original was full of neon lights in a wet and menacing urban setting, This was fog and dirt.The story was laboured and uninteresting which then made the film appear far to long - I never made it to the end left wondering why I bothered in the first place. I also didn't fully understand the complex relationship between Gosling and the female hologram, maybe it wasn't complex at all and just plain simple and I was in fact expecting far too much. In any case it made no real sense and added nothing to the base line story, rather like what I am doing now - it was used to pad out a weak film.",2,2,4,28 December 2017
Hereditary," Drama or Horror???
","Make your minds up please - was this supposed to be a horror flick or a family drama, because it failed in both genres. Which is a tragedy because it had the potential to have succeeded in one or the other, but not both. The acting was very good, the camera work was very good and the plots were independently very good. There we go again, back to the two films in one observation.
My wife fell asleep, and she loves a horror film and not even the portrayed family tragedy could retain her interest, and she loves a good weepy. 
This film was just not frightening at all 
7.5, that is just not representative of this film's worth.",4,1,4,23 August 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," What a complete mess.
","My wife and I walked into a half empty cinema expecting a fabulous cinematic extravaganza with Pitt and DiCaprio starring in a Tarantino film. Well by the time the film had passed the 60 minute mark the cinema was now a quarter full. I have never seen people leave a film in such numbers before.
I know I am not allowed to put spoilers into a review without first warning a potential reader, but there has to a plot that can be spoilt in the first place, and there isn't one. The film was a mess, from start to finish. A self indulgent mess. It has no continuity at all. OK Tarantino's films require a viewer to piece together a complex set of sub plots, that is the only reason I stayed in that cinema was in the hope I was going to slowly put the thing together and be amazed at the writers genius. Ha Ha, the only genius was my wife because she fell asleep after 20 minutes and awoke 2 hours later refreshed.
The dog in the film was brilliant, it acted superbly. Pitt has moments that were good, DiCaprio - I could not make head or tail out of what he was supposed to be, or what film he was in, or what film I was watching. If you are confused by that then you are one step ahead of me.
Please go and see this film and you too can suffer the same dreadful boring load of rubbish that we endured tonight.",2,8,12,29 September 2019
Arrival," Pretentious Rubbish
","------SPOILERS----- Octopus as aliens!! REALLY !!!! - my grand daughter could have drawn more convincing and frightening aliens than the highly paid special effects bods did for the making of this B movie. Oh, and the space craft - truly pathetic. Honestly, 1960's science fiction films are just as well done with better story lines, more suspenseful and eminently more watchable. The story was laborious, uninteresting and overly complicated. This was a film that so desperately needed kick starting but it's engine just would not fire up. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, the hype pre-launch offered such promise but what a deception that was. I now feel cheated. 8.3 - where on earth has that come from, you only have to skip through the reviews to see that this rating is impossible. Complete pretentious RUBBISH.",1,99,224,4 February 2017
