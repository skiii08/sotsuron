3:10 to Yuma," Disturbing, gritty western, with predators circling the new railroad line.
","We have petty land barons burning out their neighbors to horde land for sale to the new railroad. We have robbers (Crowe) robbing the railroad payroll coach. There are realistic hails of bullets where few people get hit, and occasional marksman-class shots with one body per round fired. We have a 'Mexican' sharpshooter, that in closeups doesn't seem to have hands steady enough to make use of the Wm. Malcom style telescopic rifle sight.I found the story uncomfortable. There were too many killings for often capricious reasons. Crowe repeatedly chatted with one of his captors, usually just before killing him. The morality of capturing the gang leader and leaving the rest of the gang marauding around Texas and Arizon seems somewhere between absurd and ignorant. And the movie seems all too apt to inspire modern day 'trigger happy' people. The violent actions seem too relevant for today to take lightly. The bad guy rides off to a prison he has already broken free from twice, the greedy land baron is thwarted from one grab, but remains greedy and unpunished.This truly is a story of a wounded Civil War veteran turned broke family man on a drought-stricken farm in Arizona. He manages to find self respect, protect his family, and recover his initially trigger-happy, killing-advocate son to responsible adult behavior.The telling of the story is very compelling, but the story wanders a bit at times.",7,1,2,24 September 2007
Deja Vu," The people part is very good, the FX vary from distracting to good.
","Denzel Washington is a favorite of mine. He is selective about what projects he takes on, and does pretty good at making a good movie.I liked the people part of this movie a lot. The emotional attachment Denzel develops for the first victim becomes a romantic interest, with time. I found this progression and conduct both human and engaging.The science is OK, I guess, one of many theories of the universe, but told in a way that seems almost like an inside joke. Only those that have had better introductions will recognize the theory.I found the rapid camera angle change effects distracting and annoying. This stuff might be the current 'technical marvel', but it sure spins my stomach. Nearly literally. And I didn't see that these sequences contributed a blamed thing to the story being told. The smooth angle transitions, similar to the viewfinder sequences in 'Erased' (with Arnold Schwarzenegger), worked nicely. The frame-jump stuff was sophomoric and distracting. I will be glad when the FX guys that like this stuff retire.Deja Vu shows us some heroic acts, some people that are dedicated to their work and kind and responsible with people. People that we want to know better, and that are just like people we already know and love. This is a good movie.",8,2,4,26 November 2006
Knocked Up," Geeks do chick flick!
","I enjoyed this movie. But I found the story much grittier, more graphic in language and in visual effects, than I had anticipated. There is very little foul language in the film, not enough to notice. But the pranks the roommates play, the way the pregnancy and delivery are depicted and described, go beyond the polite or even descriptive language I am used to, and detracted a bit from a good story. I found Ben's transformation to a good father prospect, and the sudden acceptance of Ben and Allison setting up a home to be abrupt and poorly motivated. There is no secret what the plot for the movie is. The storyline is predictable with the predictable plot complications in the expected places. The beauty and value of the story is in the telling. And that is done pretty well. I laughed a lot more after leaving the theater than I did during the movie. The story is pretty kind, has a lot of good moments, and the making of the movie has some interesting quirks. I enjoyed the movie a lot, but it wasn't comfortable for me.",7,3,10,2 June 2007
She's the Man," Mostly positive social behavior
","I have seen the movie twice, now, and find it a happy experience. The credits, the stars making appearances to plug the movie, the reviews all harp on how the story is based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Maybe they are afraid someone with a similar story might sue for copyright violation. Personally I would have preferred to see a bit less of the Shakespeare influence. For one thing, fights were thrown in to entertain Shakespeare's audiences, but the fights were also thrown in here. hey are distracting, drawn out, unappealing, and could have contributed to the story better as a one-line snide comment.Beyond that, I was impressed with the understated way the movie explores how men can express emotions, that honor, loyalty, and friendship are virtues even today, and that girls that play soccer sweat and need showers. The Illyria coach was superb -- took due note of who practiced extra, kept from getting too close to his players to maintain discipline, and showed a simple code of honor and responsibility to his players and to the world.I had fun watching 'She's The Man'.",8,1,2,1 April 2006
The Holiday," Fun
","The Holiday has a good feeling about it. Based on the Christmas holidays, it isn't exactly about Christmas. The two girls have failed romances, Cameron gets a character with little moral substance, basically promiscuous. Kate on the other hand shows a bit more character.Kate's relationship with Jack Black is greatly overshadowed by her 'love affair' with the fascinating older man next door (to her L.A. home exchange partner's house). Where Kate grows by reaching out to touch and enable the old man, Cameron discovers her impetuous 'I promise you'll never see me again' partner has children. And comes to terms with the fact that she never considered or made children a part of her life.Jack Black has a problem part. His entanglement with Kate is low key, develops slowly, and it isn't clear why there is actually a connection other than the script wants to claim both girls find love. Played low key, this may be the best performance I have seen from Black. It is the part that seems almost after the fact and poorly thought out.There are no great moments in this picture, no chase scenes (maybe Cameron running down the lane because the cab is too slow?). Kate and Jack both face selfish previous lovers, and the engaging old neighbor faces a fear of ridicule for growing old.We do see a clear distinction between a remote English cottage and an L.A. mansion. And we learn there are wonderful people behind the hedge in both settings. I will be seeing this one again.",7,2,4,8 December 2006
Shooter," Engaging
","I have seen Shooter three times now. The scenery is gorgeous. Awesome. The emphasis on long-range sniping mechanics means that a lot of mile-away scenes abound, but even so the vistas are pretty wonderful.There is a lot of blood and gore, but the feeling is somewhat remote, not related to a slasher-type gore fest. Like the discussions of technical matters in shooting long-range, the blood and sprays are a part of the story telling, an accompaniment to the shot. A reminder that not only was the target hit, but the bullet killed the target. The blood seems a touch of reality that reminds us that the point of shooting is death, not just completing a difficult task for the shooter.The first time I watched Shooter, I thought of the Bourne movies. Wahlberg seems to be presented a few times to deliberately borrow from the appearance of Bourne, probably to borrow from the success of the Bourne films. But this film is different. This is about a quiet individual, looking for answers. A Marine scout sniper searching for peace after the death of his fellow soldier and friend just before retiring.On the down side, the editors of the film need their hands slapped. Several scene transitions stand out as exceeding bad, disruptive of the story, discontinuous. And perhaps the director just failed to get the cabin scenes to come together: 'rougher than a corn cob'.Language. The 'F' word is used about four times in the movie. So seldom, it felt jarring and out of place. Like other roughnesses and detractions, it seems this should have been changed. Not because using common language is bad, but because using the 'F' word where they did takes away from the gift that the movie makes to the viewer. Like the editing, this is something that a professional filmmaker should have seen before shooting, should have been obvious while shooting, and should have slapped the editor and screeners across the face with 'needless mistake'.This story could have been shot as a western, and done well. Set in today's world, the nature scenery is awesome, the hero is compelling, and overall the story is interesting and rewarding. A feeling of determination and grim accomplishment prevails; this is not about the excitement of mayhem, or even beating the bad guys.",8,1,4,31 March 2007
The Ugly Truth," Aside from Heigl, surprisingly gentle fun
","The crux of the movie is Heigl's discovery that her ideals of relationships, her self image as a romantic partner, and her understanding of her job are all unrealistic and flawed. She learns better, begins to care about valuable goals and to be connected and responsive to those around her.The cross stories, that Butler's cynicism, though less dysfunctional in his own life, is also overly defining, the way entertainment ratings depend on fickle audience perceptions - and the way modern feminism and gender role redefinitions might threaten romantic and intimate relationships - are important.Overall, the story tells fairly trite but true lessons in fairly useful ways.The R rating is apparently by design, to attract a prurient audience. I didn't find the partial nudity, or the language to be that far from common usage, though some of the topics were certainly more adult that we want to think of for preteens.But I think Heigl was miscast. There were a very few scenes where she is appealing. In the scenes where she is portraying a cold and emotionally unavailable woman lamenting the lack of 'quality' intimate partners, where she laments loss of control of her life and work - she diverts attention from the story to her over-the-top withdrawn portrayal. From stories of her caustic behavior on set during production, I have to wonder if that is the best that the director could get from her - or left her looking that bad as a subtle retaliation for unprofessional conduct on the set. Presumably the editing was unable - or unwilling - to overcome the snub or weak performance, whichever was the case. I found most of Heigl's performance off-putting and artificial.Other than Heigl, this was a fun movie. I enjoyed much of the interplay between the main characters and watching the supporting characters delight in how the main characters interacted.The Ugly Truth turns out to not be that ugly. It treats the characters and the theme about how honesty and commitment are required for a real connection with respect and loving care. There are no real villains, the conflict is all about the fall of cynical preconceptions. And I enjoyed that aspect of the movie as much as anything.",7,0,5,8 August 2009
