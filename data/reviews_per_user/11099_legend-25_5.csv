Scarface," cry havoc! and let slip the Pacino's of acting
","Scarface is more memorable than the alphabet.  It's that good.  It's a creation that matches that of the world.  Oliver Stone wrote a script so dazzling I heard Alexander the Great used it as inspiration to conquer the world (and quite possibly lose it in the end).  Al Pacino is so great in his characterization he should be given on oscar and a four hundred and twenty six foot self sculpture right beside the statue of liberty.  His performance could not have been more accurate if the good Lord Himself directed him. A must see for anyone who enjoys seeing. Email me if you agree, email someone else if you don't. 10/10 P.S. ask me for recommendations involving more great movies, I'm not called the 'tree of knowledge' for nothing.",10,2,4,25 August 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: A Sleep Odyssey
","There are too many people out there who think this is a masterpiece.  I'm here just to counter that nonsense.  First of all the acting in this movie was a joke.  There were no great characters that will never be forgotten (oh by the way Keir Dullea acts worse than Keanu Reeves and Tori Spelling). Their is a total of five minutes dialogue in this movie, and six and a half hours of sheer silence.  Some people may call that art but i call it BORING. How can anyone like a movie where the ending is so stupid and out there, that you don't get it (a mouse must have written the script).  Hardcore fans of this movie will use the excuse 'that's the beauty of it, everyone has their own opinion.'  Ladies and gentleman of the jury that's not called beauty thats called turkey.  That's what i rate this movie, turkey.  Kubrick directed one of the greatest movies of all time (Dr.Strangelove) but this is a complete joke.  It looks like Madonna directed it.  I was so happy when the movie Airplane II made fun of this movie.  I think everyone should take part in making fun of it.  How can a movie make you fall asleep faster than school does.  That's downright sad.  If you want a great sci-fi movie rent Star Wars or Close Encounters of the Third Kind or Planet of the Apes or anything instead of this trash mobile.  The only time i would ever watch this movie again is if someone held a gun to my head and said 'press play' (nahhhh...I change my mind, I'd take the bullet).  I was so happy when this movie was over, i threw a party to help me forget how bad it was.  I only recommend this movie to people who can't see or hear (it's better if you can't hear the five minute screenplay), don't worry you'll get it as much as the people who can see and hear.  P.S.  email me if u agree with me or if you oppose me, I take on all challengers.  Write me if you need recommendations for GOOD movies (not this turtle paced junk mobile) they don't call me the 'tree of knowledge' for nothing.",Null,7,14,4 October 1999
Titanic," chick flick, enough said.
","Boy do i hate this movie.  I'm so happy this isn't in the imdb's top 250. I'm a little angry it isn't in the bottom 250, it should be. This movie is more predictable than the alphabet.  For those people who haven't seen it, God Bless You.  Please don't see it.  If you see it, it will be a greater tragedy than the sinking of the Titanic.  Let me give you an example of how long and boring it is.  If you stare at a clock tick down for 24 hours it will fell shorter than watching this movie.  The lines are such a joke, let me express myself on a couple.  'I'm flying' - Kate Winslet.  If i was beside her at that moment, i would pick her up and throw her overboard and my line would be 'no your not.'  Than the movie would end and it would save everybody sitting in the audience a lot of time.  Another garbage line was 'you jump, i jump' - Kate Winslet.  I could have done alot with that moment, more than James Cameron that's for sure.  I would have made them both jump off the boat and get eaten by Jaws (wow what an ending!).  That would also save some time.  The soundtrack was one of the worst i ever had.  It is a shame the great James Horner didn't win an oscar for Braveheart but won one for this movie.  Celine Dion still has the most annoying song i will ever hear the rest of my life.  Every time i saw her video i wanted to drop kick my television set, in hopes i might actually hit her, and shut her up.  I am very happy this film won no acting awards, that is the only justice the Academy Awards handed out that year.  I was so happy when the stupid row boat sank.  I cracked open a bottle of wine in celebration.  P.S. write me if you want any recommendations for great movies, they don't call me the 'tree of knowledge' for nothing.",Null,3,5,4 October 1999
Goodfellas," Goodfellas nah...GreatFellas
","Goodfellas is one of the best movies of the decade.  Scorcese and De Niro are the greatest director/actor combo since Ford and Wayne.  De Niro is dynamic.  Pesci is perfect.  And Scorsese is a scorcher.  The trio are the heart of this motion picture.  Liotta is just a loose artery.  Pesci could wack Kicking Bird any day and that's why he won the best supporting actor oscar, hands down.  The soundtrack is one of the best ever made, it should be sung in Church.  Scorsese is one of those directors that doesn't get any recognition from the Academy Awards (he should have won best director for Raging Bull).  Ray Liotta is average at best (he made a more appealing Shoeless Joe in 'Field of Dreams').  Lorraine Bracco is stunning, her acting has always been solid.  That is why she is receiving rave reviews for The Soprano's.  If you want a great movie rent something else, but if you want a high-octane action packed mesmerizing masterpiece you might want to pick up Goodfellas.  P.S. write me if agree, write to the person who reviewed the movie right above me is you disagree.  email me for any movie suggestions, they don't call me the 'tree of knowledge' for nothing.",Null,0,0,3 October 1999
The Godfather," Godfather is to cinema what Bill Gates is to money
","Without the Godfather cinema is missing its backbone.  Often heralded as the greatest movie in history, I would not dare disagree.  This is the only flawless material this world has ever made.  The script could not be better even if Shakespeare wrote it.  The direction could not be better if Spielberg directed it.  The acting could not be better if a gun was held up to the head of each actor.  Marlon Brando gives the single greatest performance by an actor this millenium, winning the best actor oscar hands down.  It just goes to show the entire world no actor has ever been better (On the Waterfront, A Streetcar Named Desire, Viva Zapata...)  Al Pacino was also stunning in his early career and showed signs of becoming the best actor of his generation (which he is, just barely ahead of De Niro and Hoffman).  James Caan and Robert Duvall also put in stellar performances which garnered oscar nominations for them both.  The Godfather should be studied in school to show what the partnership of perfection and complete mastery can do for a picture.  This movie is not at all matched by it's sequel or any other movie for that matter.  I would give my left arm to go see it on theater (c'mon i can't give my right arm i need that to press play and watch it at home).  No accomplishment by Da Vinci in innovation or Van Gogh in art can match what the Godfather has done for cinema.  Nearly number one on every single famous list in the world its an inspiration.  Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) shows such insight and power in leading a family I wouldn't mind letting him run America as President.  I own three copies of this movie one for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I recommend this movie for anyone who can breathe.  rating/10.
