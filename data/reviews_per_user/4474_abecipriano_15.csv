Angels & Demons," Nice ride, good to watch, but not as good as the book
","I just saw Angels and Demons from its first screening yesterday in Manila, and I must say that it's a decent rendition of the book.Basically, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is asked by the Vatican (or at least the security people handling most of the Vatican except for the Pope's protection which is care of the Swiss guard) to help understand the symbols and other forms of symbolism to help catch an erstwhile thought long-gone group called the Illuminati.The Illuminati has apparently kidnapped the 4 Preferiti, the top cardinals who are on top of the Vatican cardinals' list to succeed the recently deceased Pope. And not only are they threatening to kill them off every hour, they also stole a device with a deadly bomb-esquire effect and hid it somewhere in the Vatican.Now there's a race against time as the hours pass, and thousands of people waiting in St. Peter's Square to wait for the announcement of the new Pope.I actually found this movie lag behind Da Vinci Code in terms of twists, build up to the climax, and action, which is unlike the book in the sense that I prefer the Angels and Demons book compared to The Da Vinci Code because of its action, suspense and twists and superb plot.Whether this will make millions, the answer is clearly sure, but whether it will become a classic movie thriller/mystery, I'm not certain. At any rate, it's a good movie to watch and simply enjoy, but I don't see myself buying the DVD as soon as it comes out.",8,2,4,15 May 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Simpler but more entertaining movie
","First off, let's get one thing straight - - - this movie is NOT a sequel to the 2003 Hulk which had attempts to portray many things from the Hulk comics (father-son conflict, father-daughter strained relationship, a love triangle of sorts) that resulted in a confusing, sometimes scary (remember that scene where The Hulk was fighting off killer dogs?) movie.This Incredible Hulk version is a simpler story; however, with strong performances by Edward Norton, William Hurt and Liv Tyler, it entertains (yes the key word is that it ENTERTAINS) better than its predecessor.While it retains a more serious tone generally than, say Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk is definitely not a pushover when it comes to getting fans to enjoy a good movie. The action sequences, though not that many, were pretty good. Whatever lacking in action you think it has in the beginning, the climax between the Hulk and Abomination (you've seen that in the trailer so no spoiler there) should more than make up for it. It doesn't have many light moments (I only count about 3, really, cause they were quite few so I remembered them), but it wasn't as totally dark as the Ang Lee version.And to some extent, at least this Hulk is less CGI/cartoony-looking than the last one. While he does have those weird ridges/lines stretching across his body, making the muscles seem different than what you'd see on a big body builder, this Hulk is more realistic (but really, how realistic can you get with a CGI-made anti-hero?), so you at least have an improvement there.Edward Norton is more believable as the 'tragic-story-of-my-life' protagonist Bruce Banner (no offense to Eric Bana, but he was just too muscular and less flawed-looking that Norton). The one actor I miss here, though, is Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross. While Liv Tyler's portrayal was credible enough, I don't think anyone can beat Jennifer's take on Ms. Ross.Overall, I give it a 7 out of 10. Good enough to watch, entertaining and enjoyable without the complexities that the 2003 movie brought to the table, and a worthy addition to cinematic adaptation library that Marvel's adding every year. Hopefully, it will pick up steam after people realize that it's not the complicated, semi-psychological thriller (?) movie that the 2003 Hulk attempted to be. Rather an enjoyable cinematic achievement that's good enough to watch on the big screen.",7,3,5,16 June 2008
Sucker Punch," As advertised
","Having raised my expectations after a friend showed me the two trailers of Sucker Punch in December, I went and caught it on the first day. I was not disappointed. You know there are movies that pretend to be something they're not (e.g. Rango seemingly a fun movie and for kids, but it's not; or the poster of The Adjustment Bureau that made it seem like an action flick, but it's not). When I saw the trailer, I saw girls in hot costumes, kick-ass action, anime-inspired material, and visual sequences as only visionaries like Zach S can bring to the screen.Simply put, it was as advertised.Emily Browning stars as Baby Doll, a girl who was checked into a mental institution by her abusive stepfather, whose imagination comes to life while she's inside. Maybe it's a coping mechanism, or something more purposive for her, or maybe it's Zach Snyder's creative way of showing difficulties in real life. With Baby Doll are other young 'girls' Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Sweet Pea's sister Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and Amber (Jamie Chung) who all band together and ooze testosterone (wait, or should it be estrogen, right? whatever...) with their swords, guns, heavily-armed vehicles, and martial arts moves, as they attempt to survive their daily hell. Impressive visuals are basically the norm of the film as expected, but at least this time we see more than we saw from the trailers (which were quick cuts but had enough oomph to get the average joe (READ: guys) interested to watch) -- kick-ass action and hot women. Hell, even women who like strong female leads could get into this, too. Though there definitely will be those that will get turned off by the way women are depicted in this film.But don't get carried away - - this isn't Oscar-worthy acting, and the storyline, though well told in this visually-stunning, mind-F'ing, Inception-esque way--- is not that deep. But I didn't expect depth in a movie like this. And neither should you.Acting was fine, especially for Jena Malone, whom I enjoyed watching when she was a kid in dramas like Stepmom and For Love of the Game. Abbie Cornish was good and intense. Lead Emily Browning had spunk and emotion in hey eyes; Jamie Chung and Vanessa Hudgens looked good, too, though not much else to see their acting chops. Oscar Isaac reminded me of that Numbers guy (is it David Krumholtz?), and he was scary and devious as Blue the orderly. While I am an admirer of Carla Gugino, her character's accent was somewhat weird and she only had moments, too. John Hamm's just a familiar name making a cameo, so his acting was severely underutilized. Like I said, it ain't Oscar-worthy, except maybe for visual effects/art direction, costume and the usual fare.I still give it an 8 because I expected it like the way I saw the trailers, like I know Zach Snyder does films, and that's it.Bring your popcorn and drink folks, and enjoy this ride. The Summer movie season starts with Sucker Punch.",8,6,21,25 March 2011
Kung Fu Panda," Dreamworks hits a HOME RUN with this one!
","From the very beginning, Kung Fu Panda had me practically falling out of my seat --- laughing. It was the perfect blend of comedy, heart, and action, all necessary elements in a successful and great animation/CGI film, in the tradition of The Incredibles and (less action, but containing the heart and laughter) Ratatouille, Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc.I took my wife and nephew and niece to see it on a Friday night and they enjoyed it, too! We were totally laughing, smiling, and guffawing at Po, the main protagonist (voiced by Jack Black) and his misadventures at becoming a Kung Fu expert. This was certainly a flawed character, one that a lot of people can relate to because he dreams, he's funny, and he can laugh at himself. Also, the story was pretty clear and easy to follow because the storytelling was well crafted, and the animation was paired well with characters brought vividly to life by some of the most famous names in Hollywood. Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman are downright excellent as the main characters, and Ian McShane as the bad dude gave it the right fearful presence. Other big name stars don't shine as much, but that's because their roles are rather limited in the film. But that's still okay because the animators should be given equal credit (if not more) for delivering the funny, action and heart elements of this movie in an effective, amazing and (I've got to use this) AWESOME manner. Visually, this movie is stunning (notice all those scenic shots of the Chinese mountains, bodies of water, and the bridge scene; not to mention the action animation version of 'The Matrix' with slow-mo)... simply a delight to watch.It's clear that Dreamworks has gotten back in the animation game with Kung Fu Panda, after slight ho-hums in Shrek 3 and Bee Movie (call me crazy, but I liked Over The Hedge more than those two). Hopefully, it should earn well over $500M worldwide because it is so good.This movie rightfully belongs in the top animation movies of all time (okay, let's not include the classic fairy tales of old; let's begin with the 90's onwards), alongside my faves 'The Incredibles' 'Finding Nemo' and 'Beauty & The Beast.' Has the makings of being a classic.My wife and I enjoyed it so much that we saw it again the night after. And maybe another time... haha!Enjoy!",10,179,216,8 June 2008
Star Trek," OMG! I ain't a Trekkie, but as a movie buff, this was an AWESOME re-boot
","I headed into this movie with relatively high expectations, because the trailers were awesome...As the movie started, my wife, friends and I were treated to an awesome intro that reminds me of those cool James Bond intros in terms of impact... and it helps set-up the rest of the movie, and we eventually understand that it sets aside a series of events that makes it different from the original Star Trek crew's experiences as people (or Trekkies, I should say) know it.After the intro, it was off to Star Trek Redux, as we saw how the principal players, James T. Kirk and Spock, as well as the rest of the original USS Enterprise crew, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu, Bones and even Scotty later on, came together.Generally, the storyline is quite excellent, the action and special effects were state of the art, and I think the director JJ Abrams paced it well while the actors were generally well cast. With exception for a scene or two with Karl Urban (Bones) when I felt he was overacting to simulate the character of Dr Leonard 'Bones' McCoy, all the cast members performed admirably in the shoes of their predecessors who began this quest in 1966. Chris Pine is a perfect impetuous and brave James T. Kirk, while he is opposed and complemented by Zachary Quinto, who is a very good selection as Spock (though he has sinister looks that remind me of his character Sylar on Heroes, like he was going to chop the top of your head off... hahaha). THe other actors also come together pretty well, Zoe Saldana as the long legged Uhura, Karl Urban as a serious and sometimes-not-intending-to-be funny, 'Run Fatboy Run's' funny Simon Pegg, 'Harold and Kumar's' John Cho, and a very young Chekov played by Anton Yelchin. Coolness.The storyline, though complex at first glance, as there are time-space continuum (whatever) factors to it, allowed us to accept this re-boot, meaning there was logic to it. Though there are some elements that Trekkies will surely hate (a romantic thing that was not in the original series springs to mind), I hope that they forgive certain liberties taken by the new writers (JJ and his crew from Lost) as it is a worthy part of the Star Trek family. I don't consider myself a hard core or even part-time Trekkie (though I grew up as a fan of Next Gen), but I believe this story will appeal to Trekkies, and non-Trekkies alike. As long as you love to watch movies and sci fi flicks, this is the story and movie for you. It left me with a good feeling after I finished the movie as it was simply awesome. I empathized with the crew as they experienced difficulties and also expressed feelings of triumph when they achieved success. I am so looking forward to more Star Trek flicks to come. Lock in JJ Abrams for 5 more sequels, please! He's the best!Enjoy you guys!",10,5,15,9 May 2009
Captain Marvel," Terrific origin story with a 90s backdrop
","Grea origin story. Pacing was good, and if you don't expect it to be as grand as Avengers: Infinity War, well you'll leave the theater plenty satisfied with Captain Marvel.Brilliant acting, perfectly timed funny moments, good buddy relationship (Marvel and Fury), fab supporting cast, and enough of a story to have some measure of consistency with the Carol Danvers canon, it's enough for movie buffs, casual fans, though I'm not sure about the hardcore comic fans.Stay for the mid and end credits.Now I've become a fan of Brie Larson after this movie. She is cute, gorgeous and, quite obviously, a terrific actress (an Academy Award winner already st such a young age).",8,2,9,15 March 2019
Megamind," Megamind kicks Despicable's butt
","Having a 2nd supervillain themed animation film in the same year might have been thought of as overkill and ill-timed. Overall, though, that this movie, Megamind, came after Despicable Me, was apt because I would have simply been disappointed in Despicable Me if I saw Megamind first.Megamind has all the right combinations, a decent plot, a couple of twists, an over the top villain who eventually evolves into a likable guy, couple of good supporting characters, an homage to Marlon Brando, a couple of FB-esquire pokes of fun at Superman (including a Lois and a Jimmy Olsen), humor (lots of witty ones, too), and a couple of nice action/fight scenes.Most of all, it has a lot of heart. For a guy named Megamind, he sure shows some heart in this film that you can't just help but root for the guy (even if he was evil by design or by fate). Didn't recognize the voice talents of Ferrel, Fey and Mr. Pitt, though I could tell that Titan had to voice of actor/comedian Jonah Hill, so at least I can watch again the movie and see some snippets (if ever) of the real actor's or actors' speaking habits coming out in this movie.I'm not sure if this will be a classic, but it sure will be something I can keep watching when it comes out in DVD a few months from now. Good follow up from Dreamworks after How To Train Your Dragon earlier this year. Keep up the great works your Animation division is churning out.ADDENDUM - saw this in 3D. Like Despicable me, you may not necessarily be missing out if you watch it in 3D so watch according to your preference.",9,1,7,7 November 2010
Wanted," kick a** action worth the watch
","Before this movie, I really didn't know this relatively new guy, James McAvoy, a Scottish actor who apparently had been in the first Narnia movie. For the other castmates, sure, who doesn't know Angelina Jolie? And Morgan Freeman's great in this flick as well. But it's this unassuming dude that does so well as the stressed-out account(ing) manager turned cold blooded assassin. The transition was quite believable. From this 'geek' of a person with anxiety attacks to an efficient assassin with a special ability that's quite rare. McAvoy, Jolie and Freeman certainly make for a great cast in this action-packed thriller.If you thought 'Jumper' was an interesting concept (like I did) earlier this 2008 (don't get me wrong, 'Jumper' was decent, but nothing great or it's a DVD worth collecting), that'll get blown out of the water with 'Wanted,' a movie about this group or secret society of assassins that have been in existence for hundreds of years. The curving bullets, the action scenes, the twist of the story, the fast pace, wonderfully done directing...You just gotta WANT to see this movie (and Angelina's rear is a bonus for you gents out there). While it holds no philosophical significance nor hand-to-hand combat like say, The Matrix, Wanted's simply a kick ass action flick that's enjoyable.",8,1,4,29 June 2008
Bolt," Good entertainment value
","With many good animation flicks in 2008, Bolt has rightfully cemented its place among Disney/Pixar's masterpiece CGI/animation collection over the years which began with Toy Story over a decade ago. While it will not be a classic like Finding Nemo nor as good as one of my favorites, The Incredibles, it is a very enjoyable animation movie.Bolt has the right touches of heartwarming moments, action sequences, and funny scenes (some of Bolt's thunder were stolen by a hamster inside a ball named Rhino so watch out for them), and the concept was quite different in that the protagonist thinks he is an actual super dog. That was new.My wife and I saw this, and we have to say that we left the movie theater feeling good and entertained. It will have to be tied with Wall-E for 2nd best animated movie that I've seen in 2008, behind Kung Fu Panda and ahead of Madagascar 2. I went into this not having as high expectations like when I went in to see Madagascar-Escape to Africa... my expectation coming in was just OK; it was comparable to when I went to see Kung Fu Panda (which was far exceeded by Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, and the rest of the Dreamworks' team). So it was a pleasant surprise that there was something different to the plot, and that the funny moments were well placed.The movie may be less star studded compared to KFP or Madagascar 2; sometimes in the other movies, you can imagine the famous actor while he's delivering the funny line (say, Jack Black as Po or Chris Rock as the Zebra) so it's a little different with Bolt because neither John Travolta nor Miley Cyrus is as well known for their over-the-top comedic voicing, but I think that the casting was quite solid.The guy voicing Rhino was pretty good, especially considering the producers could have gone with one of those well known 'big' comedy guys like James Belushi or Kevin James. But here was a guy voicing a really funny character pretty well, so kudos to the movie's producers for going against the grain and not following the usual Hollywood thing and hire someone well known.Overall, the movie was well-paced, the story was simple but clear, and there was a good balance of entertainment value.Something worth watching, guys! Enjoy!",8,2,4,7 December 2008
Super 8," Excellent Story, although...
","I've been a fan of JJ Abrams for a while now, since his Mission Impossible 3 revitalized the franchise from the slow-mo,dove-flying movie made by John Woo in MI:2, and his 2009 rendition of Star Trek.This was his own story, not a sequel nor a reboot... and I have to say that this was a most excellent story with fantastic acting by the top two actors, Joel Courtney (Joe) and Elle Fanning (Alice), both of whom are children; they're well supported by Joe's best friend, Charles (Riley Griffiths) and Cary, Martin and Preston. Adult acting, though supporting, was well done by Kyle Chandler (who playes Joe's Dad) and Ron Eldard (who plays Alice's Dad). Though the critics have said that JJ Abrams takes several pages out of Executive Producer Steven Spielberg's past movies on sci-fi and centering on children, I don't really care. This is a great movie for these times, and he balances things out pretty well. The story has a good solid base, the acting superb, the emotions (be it sorrow, glee, excitement, fear) were truly felt, there were appropriate sprinkles of humor, and the action/special effects scenes were top notch.My only qualm or reservation about this movie is that it left me wondering how the ending could have been better; I mean there are quick cuts of a creature of some kind (er, ET?), but I wish there was more closure there; there were questions unanswered (why was it collecting, what was its objective, etc.-- sorry I don't want to spoil it so I cannot elaborate more). Perhaps there was too much set up that I was anticipating more when the creature was revealed. Maybe another few more minutes to give a proper ending...Anyway, the ending doesn't take away much from the movie (except my rating it a 9 instead of a 10).",9,1,3,21 June 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," From no expectations, to high expectations and then exceeding them
","I have to admit, I didn't know anything about this movie until it started showing here in Manila around a week ago. The 3D version had just opened (if I'm not mistaken) a couple of days later and I invited my niece and nephew to watch with me (and my wife). Seeing how this was a Dreamworks movie (Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar), it was likely that I'd watch it anyway... the question is, will it be another Kung Fu Panda (which I rated a 10), or a Monsters Vs. Aliens (entertaining, but not a classic for years to come; or good enough to watch over and over again on DVD; let's face it, for every excellent Dreamworks animation like Shrek or Madagascar, there's a Shrek 2 or a Bee Movie).So I read up on reviews on a local website and on IMDb, and I was blown away by their reviews, both from critics and regular movie goers. People were generally pleasantly surprised, and enjoyed the 3D as well. So... I got all excited and had higher expectations all of a sudden.Now on to the movie. There were so many great things from this movie ---Entertainment - from a storytelling standpoint, this was up there with the best of Dreamworks animation; there was decent character development whether you empathize with the classic protagonist that's different from the rest of the Vikings or just appreciate the father and son relationship as it goes through the awkward years. The build-up from beginning to the climax was well done. There was much enjoyment all around with acceptable (and only occasional) lulls, and the lessons that can be learned were good and appreciable both from a child's standpoint and an adult's. Overall, How To Train Your Dragon (or some call it HTTYD) is a good blend of comedy, action and sprinkles of drama. After all, don't you want your animation to be a pretty good mix of everything? Animation - Breathtaking; the aerial movements, the battles, the effects were all very good; not over the top, but released in appropriate doses needed to make every scene effective, memorable and entertaining. Watching in 3D adds more texture to the surroundings, puts the right amount of action at the right times, and was so generally well done that I hope this would be the benchmark of the perfect blend of cinematography and action using this technology (okay, this is not up there with Avatar's 3D but Avatar is technically live action, not animation). 3D doesn't have to be in-your-face like the old 3D's of Jaws or the more recent not-so-impressive 3D of Ice Age, or sometimes useless 3D used during the otherwise-touching and memorable movie 'Up'Voice actors - Okay, that the children/teenage protagonists didn't have the requisite Viking (Scottish- or Irish-like) accents was strange, but if you wave off the inconsistency and suspend your disbelief there, I can understand why some reviews said that the choice of voice actors was just right, and not over-the-top overwhelming that they begin to define the humor, and effectively take over the movie (like Robin Williams in Aladdin or Eddie Murphy in Mulan/Shrek). I was half expecting Gerrard Butler to shout his famous line from 300, but he was all right, too. So I enjoyed that, hahaha.Dragons - maybe I was half expecting the dragons to speak but then again, that would have placed it into a box... a box of the usual Hollywood animation (or even non animation in cases like Dragonheart) crap. So this was good. You could still see it in the actions and expressions of Hiccup's dragon friend, 'Toothless.' Plus they did a bang up job in portraying many different kinds of dragons. I thought that was quite intelligently conceptualized and implemented perfectly, from the wart-hog looking ones, to the two headed variety, there were plenty of dragons for everyone's enjoyment.Overall, this is a must-see movie for children and those who, like me, are children at heart. I enjoyed it enough to write a review again, hoping that those who are undecided will be convinced to watch it. Please do watch it, and look for that touching scene near the end between our young Hiccup and Toothless (made my eyes welt up just a little). No regrets in watching this. Even with heightened expectations, HTTYD still blew mine out of the sky. Or should I say dragon-blasted it? :-) Now to try watching it in Imax 3D before Clash of the Titans starts next week.",9,2,5,29 March 2010
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," An excellent and entertaining movie
","The fourth installment of the Harry Potter books / movies proves to be the darkest yet. With a growing cast of characters (this time, Ralph Feinnes joins as the rejuvenated Lord Voldemort), the HP series continues its momentum and in a big way! With the 3rd director of the movie series, Mike Newell (after Christopher Columbus for the first two and Alfonso Cuaron for the third), putting more serious tones at the appropriate times and injecting humor in the unique (though sometimes unnecessary ways, like HP's scene with Moaning Myrtle), he stays true to the spirit of the Goblet of Fire book.With only 2+ hours, one cannot expect that it will capture in rich detail the other subplots and exciting scenes like the Quidditch World Cup. However, it shouldn't disappoint those who expect many cuts from the original book, as well as those who don't plan on reading the books.The development of the main characters (Harry, Hermione and Ron) continues to grow in this picture, although other characters like Snape, McGonagall and Sirius Black take a backseat in this one. Truly a great movie and a perfect year ender (unless there's a blockbuster in the mold of this movie or Batman Begins in the late fall) to enjoy with friends and family.",8,0,1,18 November 2005
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Great movie, has some cheesy moments but Transformers is still great!
","Managing expectations, I never expected Oscar worthy acting performances. I expected kick ass action, amazing special effects, fabulous hand to hand robot combats, and Transformers:Revenge of the Fallen brings all that to the table.The way I remember the 2 decade old Transformers the Movie animated film/video, how robots were fighting, were well portrayed in this flick. Generally good action from beginning to the end, with somewhat passable plot and timely comic relief provided by the humans and even a puppydog like Bumblebee.I still left the theater feeling very satisfied in the entertainment that I experienced watching the movie. Can't wait to watch the next sequel in 2011 or 2012.",9,1,4,28 June 2009
WALL·E," Extraordinar-E
","It took me a while to actually watch Wall-E. People told me it was boring, there wasn't much dialogue, etc., etc.So when I caught it at the tail end of its showing here in Manila a few months ago, I came in with the lowest of expectations, perhaps expecting at least the quality of animation I'm so used to seeing from Pixar as its only redeeming value.Turned out, I was wrong. Who would've thought that with little dialogue in the first third of the movie that this would actually turn out to be a richly done animated picture? While it didn't have many laughs like Kung Fu Panda or even Bolt, this picture shows that love and hope can come from anywhere at anytime. Of course, it's balanced, well-paced and it has its share of laughs.Wall-E the protagonist (he reminds me of that Short Circuit robot from the 80's movies with Steve Guttenburg) is a unique robot. He has feelings, he's sentimental, and he's a collector of old memorabilia and interesting stuff. Plus he still does his business taking out the trash and even using the junk to make replicas of buildings. Cool.Visually stunning from beginning to end, Wall-E is a masterpiece of animation and directing. In fact, the movie has a rich detail in the portraying of Earth in the distant future as well as providing an imaginative perspective of how Earthlings could have evolved given a certain path taken. That was very interesting as well.Mostly, the movie portrays a message of hope. It may seem preachy, bringing to mind a similar animated flick in Happy Feet, but it's portrayed in such a way that it's acceptable to hear and you say to yourself, 'yeah... that's right.' It's got a level that can appeal to adults as well, and it's different than many of the things we see and consider as 'entertainment.' There are countless awesome (animated) movies that I've seen through the years, but Wall-E is so different that it's got to be included in my personal collection of worth-collecting DVD's. Truly an extraordinar-E movie made by Pixar. You've got to see it!",9,3,6,9 December 2008
Rango," Two stars out of ten, and that's generous
","Pluses: Visually well done background, some good voice acting. It can put you to sleep. (Oh wait, that last one is not good for the movie, but good for you if you've had a long day like I did and watch this movie at 10pm)Minuses: a lot; dragging story, advertised as fun but it's really not. I don't want to waste more time typing up a review. Bottom line: Don't see it. Even on DVD, folks.But if you expect that it's got adult themes delivered in animation, then maybe you'll feel satisfied after watching this. And then maybe I'll rate it a 4 out of 10.",2,6,15,25 March 2011
