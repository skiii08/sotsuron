The Rock," Breaking into Alcatraz?, yeah, sure, no problem.
","This movie really rocked me. It has thrilling fast-paced action and music really is great (I got the sound track shortly after) though people in my country are abusing it in all sorts of commercials and programs.This movie details a bunch of navy seals lead by General Hummel (Ed Harris) that take control over Alcatraz, otherwise known as The Rock, so they can force the US government to pay benefits to all the families of the soldiers who died in the wars. Now it's up to another team of navy seals lead by ex-con and the only one to escape Alcatraz, Jhon Mason (Sean Connry) and the 'Chemical super-freak' Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) to stop them. So the team gets in (quite marvelously) and all hell breaks loose when everyone in the team is killed except Mason and Goodspeed, so now they have to resolve the situation on their own.I have a classification for all sorts of media that I call 'Cosmic Meaning', where something impacts me on many levels. This one didn't got in very high but it surely got in. It's a great action movie and if I am not mistaken it's Cage's first action flick, and he does a great job, I tell you.Sean Connry does great as a prisoner who needs to get them into The Rock and so does Nicolas Cage considering this is his first action role. I recommend this movie to all action freaks, they'll love it, but not only them, I'm sure this will turn any action-hater to The Dark SideT.",9,1,1,2 July 1999
The Mummy," Never seen the original but this really rocks
","I didn't see the original movie that was made early in the century but I can tell you something about this movie, it really rocks.You take the theme of Egypt in the mid 30s, you put a mummy into it, a consistent hero, a stupid side kick, some competition for gold, an ancient curse, lots of humor, action, horror and drama and you got 'The Mummy'.I don't know about you but I gave it a 9, that's right up there next to Armageddon and Star Wars, go see it, you won't regret a second out of the near 2 hour experience.",9,0,0,14 June 1999
The Terminator," One of the greatest movies to come out of Hollywood.
","And will probably not be accepted in today's harshing-by-the-minute counter-violence standards. It tells the story of a Terminator coming from 2029 to kill the Sarah Connor, mother of John Conner, the leader of the resistance to prevent him from ever being born. The resistance also sends someone through time to protect Sarah and a hunt ensues across LA.This movie is a straight action with a little love story that develops between Kyle, the protector, and Sarah, the protectee. It involves a lot of shooting, killing, maiming and ferocious and disgustingly beautiful scenes (The one where the Terminator fixes his hand and eye using scalpel).It has almost no element of drama, feeling and very little humor so I don't really know why I liked it, but I did. This movie is not for everyone, it should only be viewed by the action-freaks, disgust-lovers and the mature in mind with absolutley nothing to do.That's about it, too bad I can't get any good quotes out of this movie, all of the best ones are from the sequel, so go see that one too.",8,1,1,6 July 1999
Back to the Future Part III," It was a mighty conclusion...too bad.
","I mean too bad as in 'Too bad this has to be the end', I mean, you all must of heard of the 4th script lying somewhere in Universal StudiosT picking up dust. (In case you don't know, the script is called 'Back to the Begining' and details a story where Marty meets the Doc when he is young but has a fatality in his family which causes Doc to think of time traveling back.) But it will probably never be taken to the screen so you will have to except this is a finale.But still, this is one 'heavy' movie. Where Marty goes to the old west to save Doc from getting shot but things go a little hey-wire since the DeLorean fuel line is torn thus no combustion can acure, sounds troublesome? probably so. So go see the movie and see how everything turns up.I consider this movie, infact, the entire trilogy as a land-mark in movie history and a thing with 'Cosmic Importance', if you don't know what I mean, I relate 'Cosmic Importance' to anything I feel that effected me beyond the first layer it was intended to and usually I pull it out some time after my first use and use it again and again and again...This movie was probably the weakest of the series but was...is a good film even though they crush the DeLorean, but not to worry, everything turns up fine.I recommend this movie to anyone who is someone, so go see it again and again and again and again and....well, you get the point.",9,0,0,30 June 1999
Back to the Future Part II," I guess one trip wasn't enough, but it was surely worth it.
","Always wanted to travel through time?? me too. Maybe not in this life time but this gives you something to look for. The theory of realtivity can go to hell, I'll stick with the 'Outatime'. In this continuation to the 1985 flic Doc takes Marty and Jennifer to fix their kids' future but unfortunately Biff steals the time machine for his own personal gain so Marty and the Doc have to undo everything.I consider this movie, in fact, the entire trilogy as a land-mark in movie history and a thing with 'Cosmic Importance', if you don't know what I mean, I relate 'Cosmic Importance' to anything I feel that effected me beyond the first layer it was intended to and usually I pull it out some time after my first use and use it again and again and again...This movie was definitely the best in the series as it details the future in a more optimistic fashion than the garbage pile people tend to expect, and most of the things are thought out through and through and really make sense.I recommend this movie to anyone who is someone, so go see it again and again and again and again and....well, you get the point.",10,1,2,30 June 1999
The Matrix," Someone wrote Blade Runner was the best Sci-Fi, I consider this it's successor.
","Is this real? or is it not real? what is real? how do you define it? Is it what you can fell, taste or smell?? What if I wake up in the morning and go to work? is it still a dream? All these questions are what The Matrix deals with. Are we living what is real?? or are we controlled by another being that is manipulating our lives for it's own good??'The Matrix is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to hide you from the truth.' 'What truth??' Says Neo. Well that is for you to find out in this epic motion picture. The movie outlines the story of a computer programmer named Thomas Anderson who is at nights a hacker named Neo. Neo is always looking around for a thing known as The Matrix until one day he is called to meet Triniti who will show him all that he needs to know.It's not just a chip-off-the-block high octane action, it has humor in it and some drama if you want to call it that way. You can classify it no better than 'Forget everything you know and seen'. They got that right. I usually happen to spit out one-liners at some scenes to what eventually will be the thing the actors will say. It worked in The Mummy, but not here. I tried a few times but given up when I saw I just wasn't getting it right, they made it completely new and thrilling.Some said that the special effects in The Mummy will blow you away.  Well, I guess in The Mummy they only used a simple pump shot gun because here it's freaking C-4. It's totally amazing how they did everything look so to the point and reliable.And as a conclusion I can only say this: What would you think if someone would come up to you one day and say that nothing is real, it doesn't exist and you have to make it all better? 'No one can be told what The Matrix is.  You have to see it for yourself.' Trust me, he knows what he's talking about, I went to see it, it was worth every second and I'll go see it again.",10,0,0,26 June 1999
