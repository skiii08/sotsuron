Casablanca," Absolute must-see!
","To my shame, I never saw Casablanca until a new print became available in London four or five years ago. I confessed this to my girl-friend (now wife) on the way out and she told me she had never seen it either. In all the cinemas in all the world .......! Casablanca always makes me recall the story of the guy who said he didn't rate Shakespeare 'because it's full of quotes'. So many of the lines have been used in subsequent novels, plays, films that they have passed into the language. But if you're after a shortlist of the films you've simply got to see 'round up the usual suspects' and there will be Casablanca. Taughtly made, superb characterisations, great story.
