Iron Man 3," The Best one yet!
","Let me start off by saying I am a comic book fan and I understand why some people had issues with the portrayal of the Mandarin. Personally I thought it was a welcoming twist.I found that the movie really showed what kind of person Tony Stark is and ties really well into past events. In the movie Tony experiences post-traumatic stress disorder from events in The Avengers, and I thought his issues were tackled brilliantly! I thought the supporting cast of the movies was excellent! The quips between Robert Downey Jr. and Don Cheadle were fantastic! I just wish Cheadle had gotten more screen time.All in all an excellent movie. But if you go in expecting The Avengers you won't get it; Iron Man 3 was much more grounded. Keep up the good work Marvel!!!",9,0,4,12 May 2013
