Iron Man 3," OMG - I want my money back!
","I proudly own Iron Man #100 - the epic battle between IM and the Mandarin.I was expecting something just as epic for IM#3.What I got was a side-show two-bit actor 'playing' the part of the Mandarin as a decoy.WHAT THE HECK?? Everyone else has said it all. Great actors in a poor script, botched continuity and no relation to the epic history of the marvel heroes we grew up with.I can't believe I sat through to the very end of the credits to watch the end trailer. I was really hoping/expecting/praying that the Ben Kingsley character would don his power rings and reveal he was the true Mandarin, escape custody and begin summoning his death squads back to him (which is what I thought these 'fire' people were at first). That would've been a killer plot twist that 'might' have made this movie worth watching and been a good setup for IM #4.PS to one reviewer: Tony getting the shrapnel out doesn't stop him from being iron man. The miniature Arc Reactor was a power source to keep the electromagnet running to keep the shrapnel from entering his heart, and also powers the suit. Now, it just powers the suit. Even in the comics, the issue of Tony's weak heart eventually went away.I could've/should've waited for this to come out on Redbox....I took my kids and blew way too much money for this...Marvel owes me that money back - just like FF: Rise of the Silver Surfer!",1,12,22,11 May 2013
