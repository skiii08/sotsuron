United 93," Not to be missed
","When I first heard about this film, I dismissed the idea of seeing it almost immediately. Why would I want to subject myself to watching people hurtling to their doom? However, I then read several positive reviews that convinced me it was worth seeing. After all, what event is more important than September 11th in contemporary history? It is important that we all think about the meaning of that day, and this film provides an interesting perspective on the events both inside United flight 93 and in the air traffic control centres that watched events unfold. The film looks like a real-life documentary, and this effect is accentuated by the use of unknown actors and even people on the ground who played themselves. The director has gone to great lengths to try and portray events as they actually occurred, using the best available evidence, and seems to have made reasonable guesses about what else may have occurred inside the doomed airline. This film leaves you with plenty to think about and should not be missed.",8,1,3,5 June 2006
