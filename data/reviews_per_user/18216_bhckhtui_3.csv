Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Awesome Movie!
","Awesome movie! Loved it, it touched me emotionally. The action was good and the plot line was interesting. I have only one problem with the movie, but that would be a spoiler so I won't right it here. I'm not a big 'Star Wars' fan, I've started watching it just a few months ago, but yet, this is one of the best movies of the year for me. Go watch it!",9,2,8,19 December 2019
