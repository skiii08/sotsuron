The Benchwarmers," my thoughts about this movie (awful&crap)
","This movie was awful and even the ocational funny lines didn't make up for the sappy stupid intended meaning of this movie. Even the pure basis of this movie was completely stunted. there is nothing funny about a bunch of grown men playing baseball with kid's that don't have even half their strength.or maybe it's just that I hate the intendded steriotypes put through in this movie, and the fact that the whole steriotyping was directly stolen from revenge of the nerds.also, even though the way this film was directed it was intended that the movie not make much sense, there were no reasons given for anything that happened in the movie... everything was just said to have happened by pure coincidence or some weird type of folly.....overall, don't see this movie, it is crap, but if you want to see 2 or three funny jokes that are misc. embedded in this film then go see it....",1,18,36,9 April 2006
