E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," How Sad
","What is wrong with people that this piece of junk can be called 'one of the best of all time' by so many? The only explanation is that I never saw E.T. as a child, and thereby missed-out on my opportunity to fall into its 'magic spell'.As an adult seeing E.T. for the first time, I watched a shoddy thing that I would have clicked off after 10 minutes if not for its famed reputation.Instead, I suffered through over an hour and a half of stupidity under the assumption that it would start getting better at some point. It never did.I just don't get it. Where is the magic? What is the appeal? The characters look like they just jumped out of a Tide commercial, and the dialogue from the Mickey Mouse Show. The special effects were anything but special. The whole movie was boring, annoying, and for the retarded only.The Wizard of Oz was truly a work of art, one that can rightfully be placed in the Top 10 Movies of all times. But E.T. is not only not a great movie, it's one of the worst I've ever seen.",Null,2,4,28 December 2001
