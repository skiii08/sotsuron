Skyfall," ..seriously... a BILLION dollars plus !!!
","They truly missed out.. as they bumped her off way too early, after a very superficial role in the film. When she was really a very interesting character, and one of the main reasons to keep watching. And should you want to see more of her (literally a good deal more) in a pretty decent little movie... search out and watch '5 to 7.' She is an amazing gorgeous creature (this film is her harsh, decked out look.. when naturale, she is soooo much more attractive).. and to boot the girl has real acting talent. As for Skyfall.. it's just a barely okay Bond production... far from one of the best of the group. Seriously, the best part of the movie are the opening credits, they were so well done.. the remainder of the production just a complete waste of time. It's just not that creative.. actually, it is in fact somewhat boring (terrible for a 'Bond' film). Totally obscene they suckered $1.1 billion dollars from unsuspecting moviegoers.",6,3,8,21 June 2015
Begin Again," ... somewhat a musical in disguise
","Haven't counted the total number songs in this film, but once you get into it a bit, it seems as if one is almost always playing. Not that it's a bad thing, for in fact, the music is one of the better parts of the movie. The story's consistently straight-forward not leaving much to get deeply involved with, and the acting follows along and pretty much gets the job done without problems (these are after all some well know names, with lots of productions to their credit). Have always liked the leads, and here they work the script as best they can. It's overall a decent way to spend an hour and forty-five minutes.. and in addition listen to some fairly decent tunes.. (some being much better than others).",7,0,2,20 September 2014
Closer," ..watching people behaving badly as entertainment
","..contains possible spoilers... ...movie should have been titled 'three shits & a pixie stripper'... ...there's one very smart decision made by one of the main characters at the very end of this film (actually makes for a best-as-can-be-expected happy ending)... it could have come about lots sooner, but storyline would've been way too short... .. it occurs when our one semi-likable character comes to their senses and flees far away from the other three fast as possible.. (those three totally deserving of each other).. ..and as for a choice between the two women.. I'm sorry, really like NP very much.. but there's little hesitation who to pick (for most of us, not all).. ..the bland story does not keep you watching, nor the characters, it's an actors film, and they do good overall work... ...in my personal opinion, I never truly got Anna sinking HOH in love with the likes of JL's character.. the audience never gets that much of any reason to like him... ...to sum up quickly, decent acting from an A-list cast, burdened with a lackluster script.",5,0,0,24 May 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," .. typical MI Cruise.. and a new face to remember..
","...she was an exceptionally good choice for the part.. very alluring, and yet not overly flashy.. and young enough, and at the same time old enough, as not to clash with the advancing age of the leading mega-star, and in addition unknown to the wider general audience. There's times little attention paid to just how important casting is to the overall success of many big films. You might have been initially interested for the obvious reasons, and the film overall was just okay.. but it will have been her involvement and captivation that keep many from departing early. There's little doubt she will be noticed time and again in future productions.",6,2,4,13 January 2016
The Intouchables," .. solid through and through enjoyable
","This film caught my eye for a couple of reasons. First of all, the exceptional viewer ratings.. and then because of the actors involved... Francois Cluzet and Audrey Fleurot.. bit.ly/12ITYmG .. (too bad hers is such a secondary role). But watching the film, what was an unexpected surprise was the outstanding performance of Omar Sy, he just absolutely steals the movie. It's one of the best performances and films you'll see anytime this year (any year). It was no fluke it became the second highest grossing box office French film of all time, and Sy receiving the CÃ©sar Award for Best Actor for his role. There are many reasons why we all enjoy watching movies, but as most have shown by their high praise of this film, you need go no further than these 112 minutes.",9,0,0,28 October 2014
No Strings Attached," ... you watch... you choose...
","..say what you will.. these guys are very good... it's the little repeated moments that prove the point.. and to be sooo young, and way above immensely talented, and to top it off standout beautiful.. it will be no questions a constant uphill struggle to keep your head screwed on on straight.. the film is fun (no wow writing credits) but the guys chosen to speak the lines well return their rewards.. it's one of the basic rom-coms in every sense of the term.. what makes this one better beyond the majority plays out on screen, as all these guys are just really fun to watch.. it's always a big debate.. casting or script... this one is an easy choice",6,0,1,13 March 2017
The Duchess," .. like they say.. doesn't always bring happiness
","Boy, did this gal ever have it coming at her from all directions.. the royal (pita) husband.. mom.. and then finally her 'best friend.' Then she has to go pick someone not just to jump-bones.. but has to go and fall in love with a guy's got no resources..(and ya know what she's going to have to deal with the hubby). This was a strange societal structure for a long time.. everyone knew exactly what's happening (too many prying eyes to avoid). He's boinking whoever he wants.. while she's totally stuck in the loveless union. Oh well, the boyfriend eventually does become PM. Ya couldn't dream it up any juicier. All the actors do a fairly decent job, and I do so like KK, although in this role was just not feelin it. Her acting skills never in question, just she would not have been the first choice as 'G'.. The Dutchess.",7,0,0,27 October 2014
Jack Reacher," .. think this one surprised quite a few folks
","When considering some of Cruise's more recent action flick offerings, this one has to be categorized a step up.. one that seems to have surprised many reviewers. It's not it's a great movie, it is a bit too long, although to it's credit does not seem so, and the story is pretty nondescript. Let's just say it manages to stay out of its' own way, and does no real harm (how's that for a backhanded endorsement). The true reason it works to the degree it does is because of the cast.. especially Cruise and Pike. They both command audience attention and rightfully so, the parts do not require super acting skills, and we know they have the talent to handle these parts adequately. It's been quite a long time since I've actually gone to a theater to see one of his films, and this would be another where i'd not be inclined to spend that kind of money on. But seeing as easy as it is to watch again on the www, I'd have to say should I come across the title again, I would maybe give it another viewing.",7,1,2,30 September 2014
Easy A," ..a better than average rom-com.. including a break out performance
","Have only seen her in a couple films, both rom-com's.. and in both those productions you can see just how good this kid is. She's 22 in this movie easily playing a high school-er, and with her looks and ability she could as easily go the other way. Once you've seen her on screen you know you'll be following her future career for a very long time, she is going to be doing some very entertaining stuff. There are lots of very attractive actors, she just adds something else that's exceptionally special... and oh that voice and alluring laughter! As young as she is, you can see by the number of films on her resume she is in high demand, just hope she does not burn out. As for this movie, it was well done and entertaining for its genre.. and Aly Michalka is surely an added bonus. PS... Easy A 2010 box office gross $78M.. next year The Help 2011 box office gross #217M... that's impressive!! Common denominator both films.. every talent & casting agent knows!!",7,0,0,28 January 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Very sad... unbelievably, this leads the Rotten Tomato list of the top 100 movies of 2015 !!
","So to date it's easily more than doubled the $150 million spent to make it.. and in addition looks like they might have found a replacement for Mel (who's still the best Max by far). So we can now all be sure we'll be seeing more of this very worn out series. Passing off two solid hours of pretty much nothing but constant, mind-numbing crashes and explosions is now what we all have to look forward to in the future. There was not much acting required for this production because there really was not much of any storyline to tell in this overly bland script. But maybe it will make some of the younger generation go back and look at several of the previous works. They might not have been as action packed as this monstrosity... but they were overall much more consistently interesting viewing.",5,8,15,10 January 2016
Me Before You," ..you know where it's going.. and it works...
","...there are a bunch try and get it done using this formula and don't come anywhere near close to succeeding. What makes this production work are a couple of terrific performances from it's leads, and a very decent job on all other levels of production. We all know where it should go, but in other hands we have to realize it might not get handled in the same manner. So many other similar films just do not come off with the level of care this one does. It's only 110 minutes long but plays longer, but none of it seems forced or protracted. It's just a charming little film, with a great bunch of actors, with a very basic and well developed screenplay.",7,2,2,6 August 2016
