The Expendables 2," Simple Priceless
","Simply priceless ! to see the bunch of actors together in the movie. It was also an awesome surprise to witness Chuck Norris's come back onto the screen! Must watch movie for all 1980's born (since almost all of our action heroes are having part in this movie)!!! This is the only movie thus far that has been able to cast all of these great actors together. (not so impressed with Maggie Chan's role, they really should have picked Michelle Yeoh for her part.) Go, watch and enjoy! P.S.: The only thing I am worried about is if there is an Expendables 3... it will be really hard to top this performance. (unless they manage to place action figures such as Iron Man and that like into it).",10,1,4,15 September 2012
