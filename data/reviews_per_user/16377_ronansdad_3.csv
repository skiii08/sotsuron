Black Swan," multi-layered but with a trowel
","Almost everything about this film irritated me from the up close camera shots to give a sense of claustrophobia to the light spots in the actors eyes.Maybe I got bored and found the whole film predictable and started noticing the obvious. It layers the trauma on top on further layers of 'meaning' to the point it bludgeons the viewer with the blinding obvious.There was a point where I expected alien to pop out of her stomach -spoiler alert- and something close suddenly does, that is, out of her shoulder.I did start laughing at one point.It is watchable, and looks really good but...",3,5,8,20 May 2012
Shaun of the Dead," credit where it is due
","the zombie/comedy genre is somewhat limited to judge Shaun of the dead, as far as the comedy goes it is humorous but not hilarious, but then very few movies can sustain the laughs. as for the horror; it is not and could not compete with the likes of the dawn of the dead remake and there is every reason to avoid that degree of horror. as for plot; well, it is well thought out with a descent preamble that is actually plausible considering it is a zombie movie and is free of the plot holes that seem to plague many movies such as 28 days later.the main thrust of criticism beyond the inappropriate comparisons with other zombie movies is the humour and characters' unlovable behaviour but this misses the key plot element. it is a rites of passage movie where Shaun has yet to grow up and treat his life and women seriously requiring a crisis for him to move on. As a story of the child moving into responsible adulthood, even at 29! it is one of the few where the protagonist actually shoots his mother. It has its clever moments and part of that is the nature of the adolescent humour without it we would not be able to track his passage.Shaun of the dead does a good job considering that it is a low budget comedy horror, it may not be American werewolf which is a classic but it is as funny and as a movie the script and plot are a whole lot more tighter than dog soldiers or 28 days or 28weeks. It is not going to be as scary or horrific as zombie movies but it is comparable IMHO, to the original Dawn of the Dead that had the depth of observation as part of the subplot.it seems to be one of those movies that will be compared when it needs to be judged on its own merits.",6,1,4,17 September 2007
A Hard Day's Night," film lovers should watch this; it is not just a fan movie
","i was barely born when this film was made and i went through my Beatle phase 30 years ago but it is a ground breaking movie. The plot is thin but watch it for the hand-held camera work, framing, choice of scenes and direction. It is an excellent example of the dramatic/comic documentary.The Beatles acting is surprisingly good in a natural sense given their complete lack of training. They are not character actors (incidently yellow submarine was voiced by actors not the band) but the director (or somebody) did an excellent job. On a historical level it is worth watching just to see 60s Britain; the cars, girls, styles and character actors.As a film it is a first in its very natural yet polished look and is beginning to look less dated as the years roll by",Null,1,2,9 September 2007
