Airlift," A classic that India will always be proud of
","Its rare, in its extremity, for Bollywood to make a masterpiece. But Akshay kumar has now the habit to steal the audiences, Last year it was with BABY and now its AIRLIFT.I was waiting for this movie since October and this is up to the mark,I had never review a movie but this made me to review.As it was mentioned by Akki that every family should take their children for airlift, and I will also recommend this to you. Their is a scene which will make you shout 'VANDE MATRAM' and IF YOU ARE A Indian ,YOU MUST SEEE THIS EPIC. Definitely ,you will feel proud after watching this.",10,41,55,22 January 2016
