10 Cloverfield Lane," Sequence worthy of the first movie is worth watching
","I love Cloverfield, it's my favorite monster movie and I love it. This sequence is very good, I loved her style, I loved how they tell other stories of what happened at that time, I want them to continue doing good sequences and for Drew Goddard to take care of cloverfield again (I do not consider the paradox a clovefield movie or anything that rubbish), I loved the acting all are very well in the film, highlight to John Goodman because this was his best performance so far, the photography as always very good, different from the first in this with many more colors and plans open and closed because it is not a 'fond footaged' equal the first, and the direction passing the feeling of claustrophobia and always showing well the size and the imposing of the howard, and I liked the refencias to the first film in the beginning of this one. Funny thing about this movie is that it works best if you have not seen and do not know the first movie, even if you know how to put yourself in the shoes of those who do not know and the end is suppressing, production set in not to say that it was a cloverfield film for the actors during the shootings, which made them more unimportant in the movie and what could happen.Errors:<ul><li>The guy is not so flexible and is slow, and gave many opportunities to kill him, I know he is big and imposing and has a weapon, but he had a chance of doing something and will not do anything.</li></ul><ul><li>She knows that howard hit her car and brought her to the bunker and arrested her in that room, and yet she accepted those excuses?</li></ul><ul><li>I waited for the whole movie to say, 'I do not care if it's out there like this or not I just want to get out of here, I do not care if I'm going to die or not' this situation that should have happened at the beginning of the movie and did not happen.</li></ul><ul><li>The moment of the woman at the door does not make sense to me, Why does not the woman simply say that she is seeing an alien invasion and opening it up that they are coming after her? and it's only you to look at the background of what Michelle knew, and where she was that you know she should open the door and get out.</li></ul>Questions That Were Left Open :<ul><li>Michelle's leg recovers, but Emmett's arm does not?</li></ul><ul><li>the aliens did not invade the bunker or all the farm places why? being that they have advanced technology, they do not have any kind of technology or a way to know that there are people in the bunker?</li></ul>Problems in the movie as cloverfield franchise:<ul><li>The end of the movie is very bad for me as clovefield franchise, in this final part of the movie you can see that there is an advanced alien race attacking the earth, and that the clovefield as a weapon, which is a concept that destroys The first movie for me, the cover of the first movie says 'something found us' and this is super good to think of and you go and know that it is just some technologically advanced aliens that 'found' us and attack? I thought the clovefield is an intelligent alien by itself and that somehow came here and started to colonize and destroy everything,</li></ul>and not that he was controlled or commanded or something, and I think it should have more aliens because I think it's cool and I think it's great to have it in the end, but that they were monsters and inferior to the clovefield, same ones of the first film are that bigger, but because they use advanced technology demonstrates that others ah above it, the clovefield is a mysterious creature that appeared on the earth, so he wanted it to continue this style leaving him emperor as an alien monster.<ul><li>The part of the radio inside the car at the end of the movie is SERIOUS? WE ARE WINNING ? HOW? one of the BEST things for me in the clovefield movie is how the movie makes it clear that everything is over, there is no way to prevent such an attack and everyone will die, he shows this all the time in the movie, with the absurd reproduction he has with his cubs as they infect humans easily, and the end is perfect because they throw a nuclear bomb in the clovefield and it survives and continues, nothing can stop it is the destruction, something that came to take everything and in the 10 clovefield lane shows that the most aliens attacking the earth. Humans magically winning the technologically more advanced and intelligent aliens who planned the whole attack, I found it funny how the term 'found footaged' did not fit clovefield's first movie, because there was no one to have found that recording because everybody died and we were just watching what they recorded, because I think it's bad that you know that the whole 'found footaged' someone think the recording after or most of them, but they and Clovefield have to be like that too, the '10 clovefield lane' and MAINLY the trash of Paradox destroyed the first movie.</li></ul>Conclusion:Note 8/10, In his first movie Dan Trachtenberg ja debut very well, after doing this with the fantastic short of Portal that is a game that I love, he comes and directs a follow-up to a movie that I love, and does it very well together with good acting performances, everything in this movie is fantastic and it creates a climax of tension and mystery all the time, a sequence worthy of his first movie, is worth watching.",7,0,0,20 April 2019
A Quiet Place," One of the best 2018 horror movies
","I love horror movies with this kind of climax, in the movie it takes a lot of the actors performances, because there is almost no speech in most part they communicate by signs and expressions, in general I liked the performances of all the actors, they are very well or okay, highlight to Emily Blunt and John Krasinski who went very well. John Krasinski mixes well the artifice of silence and jumpscare, he uses the sound in a very interesting way to define Regan, when the camera is in other characters you listen to the ambient sound, but when this focused on Regan ah no sound that is very good, for being silent it makes you hear sounds that you usually do not pay attention to in most movies, which are small sounds of stones, plants, birds and others, the sound is the best in the movie, in the movie there are some scenes of carelessness of the parents with the children, and these scenes reflect in a good arc overall.Errors :<ul><li>The first and the pregnancy in this situation, I say of course that can happen so I do not commend myself so much they used good artifices with this situation, I just thought everyone would avoid the maximum having children in this situation or they would be worried about it, because if they are they are dead, right ? No... I did not understand the baby at certain times. I evaluate the film within the universe and the rules that it proposes itself and within that, these events do not make much sense the baby stays moments without crying, and she has the baby suddenly and alone, even if she is hurt, of course it is possible but she did not suffer from it at all.</li></ul><ul><li>Not to know exactly what monsters can hear or not, sometimes they hear certain noises other times no, is an artifice of the script to make the movie walk where the monsters only listen to them when convenient.</li></ul><ul><li>I just did not like that he did not take the gun with him to save his children, and there's no escape from it, if that were so, they would have found this sound solution against them and used for a long time all over the world.</li></ul>Questions That Were Left Open :<ul><li>Who put that nail on and turned it up, does not it make sense that no one had taken it away ?</li></ul><ul><li>Okay the creatures listen to the sound and it appears, but where they stay and what they do ?</li></ul><ul><li>None of them eventually crosses with one walking around without making noise ?</li></ul><ul><li>Are so few that have destroyed everything and everyone ?</li></ul>Conclusion :Note 8/10
He is silent but tense, and creates a climax next to jumpscares using magnificent sound artifacts and good performances, an excellent horror movie one of the best 2018 is worth watching.",8,0,1,19 April 2019
