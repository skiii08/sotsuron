The Blair Witch Project," Truly haunting
","This film, to me, was rather convincing.  It was supposed to be a shaky documentary.  The noises in the night were freaky.  And yes it IS possible to hear them.  Before you go make sure your theater has a good sound system. The images in this movie are truly spooky.  Even a week later I find myself looking behind me in a dark room.",Null,0,2,20 August 1999
