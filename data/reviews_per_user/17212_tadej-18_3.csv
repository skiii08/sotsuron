The Avengers," Exceeds all expectations
","Omg!! I am shocked, how the film turned out. I had very high expectations, i was waiting for this film, for a long time,from the very begging when it was announced. And i was really worried, how it's going to turn out, with so many lead actors, i had my doubts, about them working together. Well i can say, all my doubts were for nothing, this movie turn out to be AMAZING, i still can't believe how great it was. Acting was perfect, all the actors did an amazing job. Even Mark Ruffalo, I was worried that he is going to play Hulk, but he did an even better job than Eric Bana. Humor was perfect, I was laughing through all the movie. The effects were astonishing, they will take your breath away.The story was perfect without a flaw. All the movies before(Thor, Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Capatain America, Hulk, Incredible Hulk) are a prequel to this movie, And the director did a fantastic job joining them.I enjoyed this movie so much, that i think this is my best movie of all time.",10,1,4,4 May 2012
The Expendables," Great Action movie
","This is a old fashion action movie, so take it for what it is. It's a very good movie, especially if you consider all those action star actors working together. It has to be very hard, all those stars, who are usually working alone, to join them for one movie. And they really clicked, it was chemistry between them. I admire that, and as a action lover, i really enjoyed this movie. It's full of action, and great dialog. Story isn't complicated, so you won't be confused at any time. Like i said, old fashion action movie. Don't expect nothing else or you will be disappointed. But every action lover, will love this movie like me.",9,2,5,29 March 2012
Avatar," A Masterpiece with no equal
","I think Avatar was a perfect movie. With a soul. I saw it 3 times in theaters and it was awesome. I don't get people, why they are saying, its a crappy movie with no original story. I think they are wrong. I like the movie especially because of the great story, its really touching.I think story touches you in a way, you cant even describe it.Acting is awesome, All of the cast have done a great job. I don't even have to mention the special effects. James Cameron has really proved his quality. And if you let yourself to the see the movie, they way it is, you will definitely not be disappointed, and you won't be without a dry eye.I highly recommend Avatar, its one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life.",10,2,5,29 March 2012
