Catch Me If You Can," Why this movie is not in IMDb Top 250?
","This films belongs to Di Caprio. The portrait of Frank Abagnale Jr. by Caprio is amazing and interesting. The movie begins with three impostor of Frank Abagnale with Caprio being the one. Then it shows how Frank becomes a criminal by forging checks after the divorce of his parents. Frank poses as a co-pilot and forges payroll checks and succeeds in stealing over 2.8 million dollars. He also impersonate as a doctor and an assistant prosecutor. Tom Hanks plays a humorless FBI agent named Carl Hanratty, who begins to track down Frank. Then begins the cat and mouse game. The scene in which Frank calls Carl for the first time is really interesting. Frank tells him that he is sorry that Carl could not catch him in their first meet, to which Carl replies that Frank has called him because there is no one else whom he can call. The film confirms Di Caprio as a fine actor. Catch me if you can is another jewel in Spielberg's crown.I fail to understand why this movie is not in the list of Top 250 IMDb films. Don't miss this movie. Its a masterpiece with top notch acting and direction. I would go with 8.0/10 for 'Catch me if you Can'. Go Catch it at the earliest if you still haven't.",8,1,2,25 April 2010
Wanted," Any Bollywood movie is better than this one...
","'Wanted' in one word can be described as 'Pathetic'. Its a complete waste of time and money. I fail to understand why Morgan Freeman had to sign such a stupid movie. I am not going to discuss about the story because frankly there is no story in this film. Its just dumb action which is not all soothing to your eyes. There are many weak points in this movie, the one being casting of the main lead James McAvoy. You watch him in 'The Last King of Scotland' and then you watch him in 'Wanted', you would realize the difference. You would hate him in 'Wanted' as much as you feel pity for him in 'The last king of Scotland'. Angelina Jolie looks disgusting. This is by far the worst appearance of Jolie. This is one of the worst action movie i have ever seen. And its really baffling to me that this movie has a rating above 6 on IMDb. The users who have given good ratings to this one doesn't know what film making is all about. I would recommend to watch any Bollywood flick instead of this Un'Wanted' movie.",1,2,6,1 May 2010
