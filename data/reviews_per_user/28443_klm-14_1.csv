Walk the Line," Should Have Won Oscar For Best Picture
","Reese Witherspoon was a well deserve Oscar Winner in this performance! Everything about this picture was wonderful. It was a bit long but moves at a good pace. The songs brought back my childhood memories when we had a 8 track Learjet in the 1963 Caddy. (which Johnny owned in the movie) T-Bone did a great job on the songs and I would see it again just to hear the music, as I don't watch a movie more than once in most cases.I don't cry often watching movies but this one was a tear jerker for me. The last time a movie made me weep was when I watched The Notebook...(another story) Joaquin Phoenix also was very convincing as Johnny Cash, and also was a good pick to play the part! I was glad to see he made peace with his dad at the end....",10,2,4,22 July 2006
