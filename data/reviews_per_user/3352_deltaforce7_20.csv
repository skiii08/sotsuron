Resident Evil: Afterlife," Do they make movies for brain-dead?
","After the previous installment (with the desert and all that MadMax BS) this turned into a Godzilla-attacks-Japan BS. If one has to deal with them Japanese monsters, then is it a legal requirement to carry at least TWO cheap fake Katanas and attack the monsters while letting the viewers 'enjoy' tons of idiotically mixed trance noise? The first RE was bad. The second was hardly bearable. The third was a steaming pile of the Madmax BS. And this one hits waaaay below the rock-bottom. Whoever went to a movie-theater to watch this should file a lawsuit to make the producers refund the wasted viewer's dough. This movie is not just bad -- it is not just a truck-load of BS. This is an intentional attempt to gauge the movies viewers' IQs (how low can they get) and how many of them would pay to watch this. This is a total way to count the numbers of the actual brain-dead ex-people who can still pay their own way into a movie-theater.",1,1,6,10 April 2013
Fury," WHY do we have ti watch movies about losers?
","NO spoilers here. Alright, a mother's boy gets stressed out over a bit of the WAR ACTION, and everyone all of a sudden treats him like they owe something to his parents?! Patiently every veteran lets this momma's sweet boy deal with his/her childish stresses while everyone gets killed because of this boy's lack of pretty much everything? WHAT WAS THAT? A guy who refuses to fight a mortal enemy is worse then the enemy.So, what is this movie about? Is it about a hypothetical situation where and when you get this strange right to do or not to do whatever, including the direct orders from your superior officer, and everyone keep doing their pointless best to make a soldier out of you? I could not finish watching this, despite the fact that I can definitely appreciate a good war movie. What would make us want to learn anything from this?",1,4,13,27 July 2015
Iron Man 2," Slightly better than the first, but still does not cut it
","Let me tell you this: the first Iron Man was ridiculous. Iron Man 2 attempts to be more grown up audience-oriented, but it fails flat on its face at many points. All the characters are pretty much cartoonish. Well, one should not expect much from a comic book-based production. However, the dumbest part (as it is always the case with Hollywood) is their depiction of Russia and the Russian people. First of all, Moscow is not a some kind of a snowed in dumpster. These days it is more impressive than London or NY. It is what it is and if you are not sure about that, then buy yourself a plane ticket to Moscow and see for yourself. Secondly, why the heck those Hollywood producers and directors cannot afford to get even one actor who speaks realistic-sounding Russian language? They make stuff up in the dumbest way when it comes to things foreign! And it looks stupid and cheap. What is the story with their idea of the Russian names, too? All those 'Ivan Vanko' names sound idiotically made-up. Also, how come that practically each and every actor who plays a Russian character does not even remotely resemble a Russian-type person? I mean, the good old Mickey Rourke is so overloaded with Botox that he does not even look like himself anymore! And who told those Hollywood people that a great inventor and a scientist would look and act like an ape and a very common thug of a completely indiscernible national origin? Do they meet a lot of ingenious and highly educated thug apes there in Hollywood? In short, the director of this movie did not bother one bit to make his production appear even reasonably realistic where it could use some realism. The whole flick just screams 'we know that whoever will watch our movie is a dull, uneducated garbage-food eater and whatever we make up is going to be good enough for our 'IQ in the negative range' viewer!'",2,2,5,23 May 2013
Passengers," Another dreary, unbearable story of 'emotions'
","This is just another movie about digging deep into someone's disturbed emotions.This flick is no exception. On a background of space colonization travel, it tells this boring story of 'highly' emotional people dealing with their emotions all the time. Any technical discomfort drives them further insane into their mental weakness. Sad, boring, stupid.If these kinds of clowns try to inhabit them poor other planets, then the 'emotional' individuals shall find themselves amidst the same dull, weak, boring problems that they tried to escape from. Besides, it is funny how colonists who should be a steadfast and resilient bunch actually need this space cruise ship with all the amenities! If they cannot travel in any conditions other than such as of a 5-star resort, then how would they survive the most likely hard and dangerous conditions of a faraway planet that needs to be colonized?Sad, boring, dull, stupid. Why do I ever watch such garbage anyway?",1,13,24,6 March 2017
Resident Evil: Extinction," More Mad Max stuff? WHY?
","This was stupid and boring the very first time and after all those endless repetitions of the 'Mad Max' 'Desert World' 'Everything is extinct' 'Everyone is Crazy' 'People Drink their own urine' 'Rusty cars' 'Post-apocalyptic BS is everywhere' 'Chicken Fences around the Post-Apocalyptic compounds' 'Sweaty Post-Apocalyptic people walk around talking about sad Post-Apocalyptic stuff' it became totally UNBEARABLE! A MESSAGE TO THE DIRECTORS OF THIS BS: IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY NEW IDEAS, THEN STOP PAYING YOUR MARKETING PEOPLE, FIRE THEM AND TRY SOME NEW IDEAS. IF YOU CANNOT DO THIS, THEN QUIT THIS BUSINESS!!! JUST GO AWAY!!!",1,1,5,10 April 2013
Interstellar," A sci-fi fan dares to rate this LOW
","This seemed like a complex, no basic entertainment-sort of a film-kind of experience. Should have been great as far as the concept goes. What I didn't like right away is the overall idea: IF there is a problem, then WALK AWAY. Meaning, the problem is never solved.Also. Complex concepts are displayed in a matter of a few fragmented shots. Even those who are used to the Sci-Fi genre are confused. But the rest are lost. What's nice are the certain technicalities. But the human, physical side is difficult, unexplained, overly politically correct and accompanied by other things that don't get a viewer anywhere near the point of all this.So, this could've been a real nice piece of a more intellectual sci-fi, but the makers of this movie got confused about how to depict such concepts.",1,6,9,1 April 2016
Pacific Rim," Hollywood hits the new Low
","Alright, so these days it costs $180 millions to make a movie that is dumber than a game of 'action figures' being played by a couple of 5 year old children with mental development issues.There is this script obviously inspired by a set of 'Mega Monster vs. Mega Robot' plastic action figure toys. Then, a bunch of similarly plastic actors is thrown into the whole mess. Well, this is it! This awful flick is DUMBER! NOISIER! MORE BOOM AND BANG! MORE FLASHES OF COLOR LIGHTS!Not that the Pacific Rim movie deserves a discussion or anything, but the bigger any creature gets, the easier and slower target it becomes. The tiny, microscopic organisms are truly scary. But any organism bigger than an elephant stops being dangerous. I will not waste my time talking about a possible bone mass and strength that a gigantic creature would require or speculating about a quantity of food needed to supply energy to a walking tower of flesh. I mean, dinosaurs died out on their own, because they were way too big (most of them were pretty big, you know).So, what would stop the military forces from taking down those slow and huge monsters using tactical nuclear missiles? Do not tell me that a 10 or 20 kiloton warhead would not kill any creature of any size by essentially evaporating it (with not too much collateral and fallout). So, what happened to the tactical nukes in this movie? Whoever made Pacific Rim never heard of such weapons? They demonstrated some F-22 fighter planes (no A-10 attack planes were available?) flying at the monsters and shooting CANNONS! Well, then the makers of this movie are dumber than those who volunteered to watch Pacific Rim and then came here to leave the 10-star reviews! WHY NOT hire any military consultans??? Anyway, what is this pathetic obsession with the giant walking robots, transformers and stuff?Go watch this movie and experience your IQ dropping 40-50 points. Honestly, if movies like this one are made AND watched, then we truly live under a social system known as IDIOCRACY or probably IDIOTISM.",1,93,165,16 July 2013
American Sniper," Confused movie full of 2-dimentional cardboard characters
","I would like to make this review about the movie in question, while avoiding as much political rhetoric as possible. This site is not a political publication, so we all should concentrate on talking about movies here. I cannot believe how primitive and illogical this movie turned out. I expected something deeper and more believable from Clint Eastwood (don't know why, but I did). What is there to like in this movie? Well, maybe some good camera-work, some FX, such as the sand storm scene. Those turned out fine. What's so illogical about this film? Many things are.For instance: 1) The main character who considers himself such a dedicated, G-d fearing Christian doesn't think twice about stealing from a church (although it is just an old Bible, but theft is theft, especially from a place of prayer; Kyle never reads this Bible, though. Some Christian.). 2) Then, this same dedicated 'christian' eagerly runs on multiple killing sprees all over the world shooting not just adult male combatants, but also women and children -- all based on what he saw once on CNN. Isn't it just lovely? The CNN folks don't blink twice before telling everyone about Australia building a wall on the border with SLOVENIA. A wall. On the border.It order to feel good about these killings, the main character just calls the people of Iraq 'savages'. According to this movie, it must be cool to be killing 'savages', if CNN tells you so. But then again, since '...In real life Chris Kyle and his fellow SEALs were such big fans of GI Joe that they named their vehicles after 2 of the characters...', there is no reason to expect any extreme intelligence there. 3) Being an experienced sniper, the main character occupies same poorly protected and not tremendously well hidden spots for hours, making multiple kills without ever worrying about being detected and taken down with an RPG or a mortar, although later on one single shot made by Kyle causes his team to be immediately noticed and what looks like hundreds of enemy combatants attack the team. Kyle's spotters don't ever do any spotting. They just sit down somewhere making jokes or snoozing. I guess that Clint Eastwood is not really familiar with some basic principles of sniping and doesn't really know that a long-zoom rifle scope usually produces a very narrow field of view that makes it hard to see 'the big picture' around you. So this Kyle character goes on identifying targets, correcting for wind and temperature, taking targets down all on his own while endlessly chatting on the radio and on his phone. What a marvelous fairy-tale! 4) He constantly loses expensive equipment, such as a sat phone, a customized sniper rifle, and he never gets reprimanded for it. Then eventually his comrades practically lose him in a sand storm. 5) Counter-sniping in this movie never involves any use of artillery or air assets. All the snipers just run from/after one another while dodging bullets. Counter-sniping done western-style.While true patriotism is admirable and there must be more movies made depicting it, this film is full of what is called 'patriotic garbage' in its purest form, which is very unfortunate, because it cheapens image of a real patriot. Most of the 'civilian' scenes are nothing but clichés and they merely water down the action. So, generally speaking, this could've been a great dramatic and action movie, but it leaves a comic-book impression with compete and utter disregard for any aspects of morality. Certain scenes are obvious plagiarisms 'borrowed' from Top Gun and Black Hawk Down. When a director lacks his own original ideas, it is a HUGE 'minus'. This movie seems to be highly rated and well accepted by other CNN/Fox viewers. Not a 'plus'.",3,5,35,3 April 2015
Oblivion," Another title that makes you sad to review
","Alright, so there goes another pile of SFX done by people who do not know ANYTHING. Yeah, you get to see outposts/giant ships in the sky. You get to see flying things. You get to deal with another relationships drama. Yeah, you get to see another non-Russian looking actress who pretends to be a Russian. But this is where the good things end. Hollywood! STOP RECYCLING THE SAME IDIOTIC GARBAGE! MOST OF THE MOVIE VIEWERS ARE NOT AS STUPID AS YOU ARE! Do not get confused by all those 10-star reviews. Most of them are done by paid 'reviewers'. This movie is wrong tactically. Every tactical aspect is wrong and stupid. STUPID. Should I even attempt to mention the tactical flaws? a) No camouflage is used by the main character. He can be seen from miles away. b) Why the concept of helmets is lost so completely? The main character does not wear a helmet even when he rides a dirt bike (a white dirt bike). c) A huge, long WHITE-colored rifle will get in one's way most of the time. Did anyone notice any spare mags? d) What is the story with the rifle-mounted flash light? Don't they have any NVGs or light-amplifying sights? No camouflage + bright flashlights? Do they want to be detected by anyone from miles away? e) The main character is constantly exposed, because he ridiculously works alone. There is no one to spot for the guy who does repairs and therefore cannot watch his 6 o'clock. He acts as though he is alone on the entire planet, although he is so obviously not alone. f) No body armor?! Why? The main character is evidently challenged by various opposing forces, but he has no ballistic protection (see the part b about the absence of helmets). g) If, or rather, when that flimsy flying machine brakes, the main character will be stuck in the middle of radioactive no where. I would not take this job. e) Since the flying machine is not a helicopter, then why does it have a large tail with a fan? A tail rotor is only used on single-rotor helicopters. The flyer in the movie is a heavily thrust-vectoring machine with two engines. So, the tail with a fan becomes utterly useless, obviously. Also, whatever kind of concepts they employ are WAY OVERUSED! Crushed Moon, crumbling Earth, robots getting out of control, clones, Earth invasion, ruined Manhattan, etc. Whiskey, Tango, Fox is wrong with you, Hollywood? You people keep releasing piles of the same nonsense again and again and again! Also, all this sentimental BS is tiring. Just to make the movie appeal to love-starved house-wives, the producers had to add tons of boring 'feely' sentimentality and unappealing 'romance'. I do not even feel like reviewing such pile of garbage. No, I did not finish watching this movie. I got sick of all the silly nonsense. Thank you, Hollywood. Please, keep making the 100% recycled post-consumer sort of movies, so that more people can learn to appreciate and to watch the old classics more often! At least I know for sure that the old 'dream factory' is totally ruined now.",1,62,124,24 July 2013
The Transporter," One of the dumbest movies ever made
","+There may be a small spoiler here+I do not know why every low-grade movie director from Asia feels that it is his sacred duty to be making pointless movies about Asian gangsters and a stylized 'kung-fu' fighting. This movie is definitely of of those. What I especially disliked about The Transporter is that everything and everyone in it is unnatural, cartoonish and dumbified even for an average 'superhero' flick. And as far as the action-movie qualities go, The Transporter offers and cookie-cutter set of typical 'action' effects - a car chase (a way unrealistic one!), a missile-launcher shooting and explosions (waaay pointless), lots of unrealistic small-arms shooting (do you want to see rifle bullets flying straight through think brick and mortar walls? why?) a 'kung-fu' fight (Jackie Chan probably puked if or when he watched it), a car-bomb bada-boom (a HUGE blast, but no one gets hurt), and a difficult and inner-conflicted supporting character. In short, it is a dumbified movie that takes itself seriously for no reason whatsoever.",1,1,3,3 April 2013
Avatar," A potential great movie turned disastrous
","It would be lovely to be able enjoy a good movie from a used-to-be good director, but this is not the case. 'Avatar' can only offer you somewhat interesting CGI, but no story, no characters and no way to relate to this overpriced cartoon in any way. On the positive side, I found Zoe Saldana as Neytiri to be kind of cute. What I specifically disliked: 1) There are ridiculous entities in 'Avatar' that sound just stupid and come with no explanation, such as the name of this moon, which is 'Pandora'. Is it an indigenous name or a nickname? What's this 'Unobtanium' mineral and what does it do aside from just being potentially shiny? Are those unexplainable floating mountains made of 'Unobtanium'? In science, this term is used for describing a non-existing material with impossible qualities. 2) I do not even have to mention that 'Avatar' feels like a bad mix of 'Star Wars', 'Dances with Wolves', 'Matrix', 'Pocahontas' and a half a dozen of other rather famous films and even video games. A number of concepts were so obviously recycled from 'Aliens' that it was sickening to watch. There are no original ideas in 'Avatar'. 3) Why are those blue aliens act so much like people from African tribes? Them aliens should not have been from Africa, right? What is all this African and Middle Eastern music for? 4) What is the story with the animals? Why do they mostly look and act like the Earth animals. I can mention the Pandorian animal species that look to me so much like rhinos, horses, wolves, and even the ancient flying dinosaurs - the pterodactyls. Those natives just keep riding them extra-multi legged horses in a usual Earth-like way! Looks like the moon of Pandora was borrowing lots of animals from Earth. Whoever might have been doing this? 5) How come that the blue Pandorian aliens use all the familiar primitive Earth weapons? I am talking about bows and arrows, bolos and such. 6) What is the story with the English language? Its comprehension among the characters goes on and off all the time. First they do not speak any English, then they speak some broken English, then no one speaks English again and then, after months of studying the native language, the main character fellow all of a sudden needs an interpreter to speak to the crowd of locals. So, he seems to have forgotten the Pandorian language and the locals forgot every bit of English all of a sudden. 7) How come that the arrows that the natives shoot are harmless to the aircraft at first and then then work as effectively as armor-piercing munitions with depleted Uranium cores? 8) Why the whole movie has no background story? This makes all the characters even more flat and lifeless. Also, one can get sick of all this liberal anti-American and racist ideology that 'Avatar' builds upon. Couldn't they play some other cards that are not so obvious and overused? Anyway, it is a great shame that this potentially tremendous movie turned out even worse than 'Terminator 2'. I do not regret watching 'Avatar', though. Now, I know exactly what kind of mental abilities to expect from people who rave about it.",2,5,8,3 July 2010
Sausage Party," Vulgar, dumb, boring, disgusting
","I can definitely appreciate some harsh humor, since my life's experience and my taste both allow me to be just a bit slightly above a very-down-below-average docks worker (with all due respect), but nothing -- NOTHING -- can excuse this endless, POINTLESS, stupid swearing-for-the-sake-of-swearing.I watched some cartoons mostly intended for the adult audience. A number of them I disliked, some I disliked slightly less. Some I liked to a certain degree. But this one is a pile of scummy dirt that starts like dirt and ends up like a total rotten garbage.In short, this whole pile of trash does not offer any excuse for its existence. Even if one is far from any moralistic limitations, then this cartoon-flick is still entirely pointlessly dirty and dull. It is pretty much like saying f%ck-f$ck-f^ck and so on with no apparent reason, except for the one's who says this inability to pronounce any other words. Seriously.For the maker of this nonsense: this IS your last chance to start taking some good, Rx anti-psychotics. Better do it now.",1,1,5,20 March 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Giftless directing vs. great actors
","I must admit that I decided to give this movie a chance mostly due to some good actors starring in it, plus I assumed it would be kind of like a parody about the superhero genre. From the very beginning something went terribly wrong - it was the music. This pointless, annoying drumming that would not stop. I am sure this 'music' was performed by a poorly trained monkey. Then there were those loose pieces of pointless monologue that made no sense. It must have been written by a dysphasia patient. And then I could not help but notice that the dialog was written for merely the sake of producing useless sounds. Kind of like their drumming 'music'. Even worse than anything else about this movie was lack of any mood. Whoever made this horrible waste of video recording technology was obviously on drugs and disgustingly in love with himself: 'oh, look! whatever I do always comes out awesome! and you, common people, must watch this movie standing up and applauding all the time, because if you don't, then any self-important movie critic will tell you that you don't understand art cinema!' The old story of 'The Emperor's New Clothes' keeps happening again and again. So, if you watched this pretentious crap of a movie, then don't be afraid to admit that it made no sense, that it wasn't any kind of art, that you actually wasted time. Just cry out: 'But he isn't wearing anything at all!'",1,26,53,11 February 2015
Prometheus," Way below any reasonable expectations
","*This review may contain spoilers*I am a huge fan of the first two Alien movies, so I guess my standards as well as my expectations for any Alien sequel/prequel are high. Unfortunately, the only bright spot of the whole film was unexpectedly interesting performance of Michael Fassbender as the android David. True, his part has its share of stupidities and inconsistencies, but it is at least watchable most of the time. I am sure that by now you can guess that the vast majority of reviewers here were unhappy with the Prometheus film. Instead of repeating the others and giving you my general impression, I will try to highlight the worst stupidities and inconsistencies that this movie is entirely made of. 1) In the beginning of the movie, one of the Space Jockeys, an Engineer as later called, arrives to prehistoric Earth and dramatically dissolves himself into a bunch of molecules in order to populate the planet. Why such dramatic sacrifice was necessary, especially if seemingly a few years later the Engineers decided to destroy their creations using the unruly Xenomorphs? 2)If the Engineers and the humans share precisely the same DNA structure, then why don't both species look more alike? 3) Also, if the first Engineer on Earth who dissolved himself, released the 'building blocks of life' into a river', then why people did not evolve as water-living creatures, but instead prefer to live on dry ground? I mean, humans cannot exist under water. Plus, if the Engineers created ALL life on Earth (animals and such in addition to humans), then how come people do not share the same DNA with fishes, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects and so on? 4) If those archaeologists in this movie discovered so many ancient depictions of the Engineers visiting Earth (as a matter of fact, there are many somewhat similar actual drawings that do depict human-like creatures flying spaceships, wearing space suits and such; do some research), then why all those cave wall drawings point at the stellar system where the Space Jockeys established a small military base? Wouldn't it be more logical for the Engineers to be pointing at their home world, to the place of their origin? 5) Alright, so later on a private corporation (then just Weyland - not Weyland/Yutani) funds this space expedition. Seemingly only about 80 years from today there are interstellar spaceships capable of faster-then-light speeds, there are androids and whatever not. I do not expect this to be happening so soon. HOWEVER, if this is such a well-funded expedition, then why the entire crew of the Prometheus vessel carries around the 8 AA-battery powered LED flashlights that are sold on eBay today? Those three-beam LED flashlights that they use are Fenix TK45, and I own one. Why couldn't they make a prop flashlight or a night vision device that would look and function more futuristically? 6) It is quite unbelievable how this fully automated spaceship arrives so precisely to the right planet (or moon) without any preliminary research. The crew makes a decision to LAND without being certain that there is anything on this planet worth landing. Why were they so sure? In the case of LV426 (in the Alien/Aliens movies) there was that emergency beacon signaling from the Space Jockey's spaceship. And the beacon allowed the USCSS Nostromo to be guided to the right spot. What guided the Prometheus? A wild guess based on the prehistorical cave wall drawings? 7) Why the Prometheus space vessel lands in its entire bulk? I mean, is it feasible of efficient to be landing and taking off the WHOLE interstellar spaceship? I mean, that thing is big and heavy! And its interstellar engines and power sources must be useless for planetary landings and take offs, so they are nothing but a huge amount of dead weight. In both Alien and Aliens movies they used MUCH smaller and lighter vessels to land and take off, which does make scientific sense. I mean, while a landing vessel is on a planet, the rest of the interstellar ship (the mother ship) is safer and better off remaining in space. 8) Before landing of the surface of LV223, the crew of Prometheus did not bother to do any research and investigation of the planet. Only by chance the 'alien structures' were VISUALLY discovered later on during the final descent. 9) Once the Prometheus ship lands, there is no investigation of the surrounding environment, they do not scan or drill ground around the alien structures therefore missing the Space Jockeys' ships buried a few inches under top soil. 10) At first, most of the crew does not seem to know what they are after, why they were hired for this important expedition, so they get introduced to their mission by watching a lousy 3D presentation that mostly shows this old Peter Weyland fellow and his stupid dog. 11) I don't even have to mention that all those 'top scientist' are consistently unscientific in their actions, their attitudes, their inability to properly cooperate. What was the purpose of hiring those mostly weird amateurs? They did not even have a lot of common sense, so one cannot even begin to discuss their 'professionalism'. 12) Why weapons would not be allowed to be carried on a 'scientific' mission? When someone is on such a mission, does it automatically guarantee one's safety? I mean, peacekeepers and medics involved in military conflicts (read: hostile environments) are not safe, although everyone knows how to tell a doctor or a peace keeper from an enemy combatant. But aliens couldn't tell a scientist from walking and talking fast food! So, who can assure safety of the scientists working on an alien planet full of hostile life forms? Right, no one can. So, proper weapons are necessary for basic self defense.",1,6,9,1 October 2012
Fifty Shades of Grey," 50 reasons not to watch this garbage
","This movie might have been somewhat better, but its producers and directors did everything in their power to ruin the whole useless thing even further. They could've made a movie about a dumb girl with a pointless go-nowhere education, go-nowhere job who found herself in this Ersatz-Cinderella sort of story where the Prince turns out to be a monster and so on. But this is where the makers of this flop show how lost they are and how they have no idea what to do with this sorry piece of pseudo- literature. The only one minor redeeming value of this movie is the depiction of the main female characters. Both female roommates are shown as rather brainless whores one of whom finds herself stupidly confused while trying to figure out a difference between mindless whoring, prostitution, and romance. So, this Ana character keeps slowly and boringly contemplating how should she prostitute herself out to this sicko guy, although with all her dumb drinking and with her being just a loose girl she might not even remember who did what to her, when and where (getting educated but not getting smarter is what plagues her). But I am afraid that I am inadvertently making this awful movie sound more interesting than it really is. Because truthfully, this is a slow-dripping, boring, pointless crap. No, it is not really 'sick'. It doesn't explore any 'dark sides of human nature', since the characters appear so 2-dimentional and uninteresting. No, it is not sexy. There is no attraction between the main characters and they are dull to watch. No, it is not in any way more dramatic than a wet sponge. No, there is no interesting dialog in this movie. No, there are no unexpected plot twists. Is there any plot there at all? I didn't notice any, really. No, there are no valuable lessons that could be learned from any of this. Truly, this '50 shades' thing is an empty shell of a movie based on an empty shell of a book made for empty shells of women. I just can't imagine a non-brain-dead person watching this travesty. Hollywood proves one more time that there are more than 50 ways to produce garbage that can still be sold, re-used, thrown out and re-sold again as long as there are 'consumers' out there who would buy any annoyingly-marketed trash.",1,8,14,1 March 2015
Iron Man," A typical Marvel-based product
","I know that one should not expect anything deep or serious from a comic book-based movie, but with all this talk about the Iron Man movies being psychological, dramatic and stuff, I took my time to watch this one. Well, it started out on a lower grown up level of complexity, but then it turned into a typical Marvel comic stuff. If this kind of a movie is intended for the adult audience, then the audience members should have their IQs rated at no higher than zero. Otherwise one could not watch all this ridiculous stuff seriously. On the technical side, I did understand why all the Al-Qaeda guys carried those expensive modern German-made H&K rifles. 99 times out of a 100 members of those organizations use Chinese, Romanian, Check, Polish or sometimes Russian-made AK-family of rifles and machine guns (mostly the outdated models). The remaining 1 our 100 may carry an old FN or a SIG rifle, if not a WWI-era Lee Enfield. If someone does not know these obvious facts, then he really needs to start watching news reports at the very least. It does not require one to be an expert on terrorist organizations or firearms to know this. It was also funny to witness that shameless Burger King promotion, if you know what I mean. I guess that a true American patriot and a visionary will not eat any Subway food, right? In short, this movie is a childish pseudo-Sci Fi and it does not even cut it as a piece of mindless entertainment.",1,7,15,22 May 2013
Lucy," Aside from the usual commercials - an actual review
","Prepare for a review from someone who uses more that 1.0% of his/her brain capacity. Scary? It should not be so. This movie, while being based on an interesting theory claiming that humans do not use more than 10% of their 'brain powers' caters to the usual, common audience that hardly uses 0.001% of the thinking power given to them. First of all, I do like Luc Besson and Scarlett Johansson, so I have nothing 'personal' against them. I DO hate all those endless close-ups of Morgan Freeman. All he does is this: he speaks decent English SLOWLY while keeping a serious face. All of his roles are like this. The idea behind this movie? Is there one? Aside from a metric tonne of rather inexpensive SFX, there is this poorly hidden ILLEGAL DRUG PROMOTION that is intended to make one think the following: 'IF ONE OVERDOSES ONESELF ON SOME UNKNOWN, OBVIOUSLY ILLEGAL BUT PROMISING-NAMED SUBSTANCE, THEN ONE MIGHT JUST AS WELL ACHIEVE SOMETHING LIKE GOD'S POWERS OVER EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE'. As far as anyone who is NOT ALWAYS on drugs thinks, this is the idea that is being promoted by this movie. Really, unless you are an uneducated junkie or an underage fan of a cheap movie visual SFX, then you might probably figure out that no matter how much of your brain capacity you manage to control, it would still NOT make you a god of some sort, it would NOT make you capable of controlling anything else short of your own ability to memorize, analyze, and learn. THIS IS IT. The rest is nonsense. Unless you start abusing illegal drugs and find yourself being capable of controlling the court, the jury, the law, the space-time continuum, it all ends when the drugs are out of your system and you are in jail. So, in short, just SAY NO TO DRUGS AND TO THIS MOVIE!",1,2,12,14 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Empty, disappointing garbage
","At first I scarcely liked the beginning, but then everything quickly became confusing and poorly slapped together. This is my main point. JJAbrams or whatever his name is (who cares) thinks that his very limited sub-directorial intelligence is good enough for everything that has the word 'STAR' in it. Well, he is entirely wrong. He has ruined StarTrek and StarWars already (these two Universes have nothing in common except for the useless light flare adored by Abrams). In short, this movie was worth watching the first thirty minutes of it. Then it became an ugly-ridiculous-dumb rehash of SW|ST|ALIENS stuff. Abrams, you have no ideas of your own and your movies stink! I feel sorry for those losers who honestly decided to rate this recycled mess higher than I did. And my rating is based on the initial thirty minutes of this mess. NO thank to the Hollywood idiots for delivering another noisy mess of a movie.",2,21,27,29 March 2016
Alien: Covenant," Wtf was that?
","Horrible. Horrible. There are no words to describe this politely. If the 'Prometheus' was just bad, then this idiocy BASED on the already failed concept of the 'Prometheus' movie could not possibly be dumber then dumb. This is beyond contempt. 1)What was the story with the solar sails that were called 'recharges' or something? Obviously, they were 'sails'. Had no light-catching properties. EDUCATION, people. Get at least SOME EDUCATION, before you start making movies... Really... 2) No automatic controls. Is this for real? Someone invests heavily into a certain project and then every member of the crew gets frozen, but a computer cannot make the simplest decisions w/o killing a whole bunch of everyone??? 3)WHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE? I cannot possibly associate with ANY one of the actors. They come from nowhere. I don't know what they do and who they are. They look pretty much the same. Can't tell them apart. How can I possibly care for any one of them??? 4) The crew members have no obvious command chain. They all act like some school idiotas. This kind of structure cannot possibly survive. 5) Why don't they have any meaningful ways of protecting themselves against alien life forms? NO respirators -- NOTHING? Why do they bother wearing those idiotic caps with 'ears'? What's the point? There are potentially aggressive bio-entities out there of 'who-knows-what-sort'... At this moment I felt as though this amount of pure stupidity was WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much. So, I stopped watching. Enough is enough. I don't have to wallow in dirt in order to figure out that this dirty cold stuff is dirt. I do not feel obligated to be in any way 'nice' to this sort of a completely trashy product. This 'movie' is garbage. Well, garbage can be recycled. This is worse than garbage. This is total waste.",1,3,6,9 July 2017
The Martian," What a ridiculous waste of time. A true insult of a viewer's intelligence.
","1st of all, the premise is all wrong, so there is no suspended disbelief effect here. Therefore, the rest of the movie becomes less than believable. BTW, I 'appreciate' the whole re-use and abuse of the 'Aliens' concepts and designs in the initial titles and the crew quarters appearances. Awesome. Reuse/Recycle. No new ideas there.A whole manned mission to Mars couldn't include a way to observe the Martian weather (this being possible for tens of years as we speak) and to land safely at a nice, wind-safe crater or to anchor a return vehicle securely enough? REALLY? And once a bit of a storm blew, the entire crew had to hurry back to Earth? ALL THE WAY BACK? They could not stay in the Martian orbit for a few hours even to make sure that they didn't leave anyone behind? WHAT? The orbit became dangerous too because of some storm? Am I the only one who could not believe that the hatches would seal nicely in a sand/rock/what's not storm? There was no two-way comm with any crew members? Once someone got blown away, then it was the end for him/her? Even on Earth this sounds dumb. Cool crappy, unrealistic suits! No real protection, funny boots, no visible means of backpacked life-support, lots of light blinding the users inside helmets and no light (as well as no two-way comm) for the actual work?! Then, no one could keep a communication satellite in the Martian orbit? So that no one would have to reinvent the wheel it order to communicate between the surface and the command center??? No further comments here.Kudos to the political correctness lawyers. They didn't miss one single detail. The manned mission to Mars includes the politically correct balance of males and females, they got a Mexican, a German (seriously???), and then the entire NASA's Martian program has the necessary number of very respectfully black Hindus and other African Americans. Good Job! Then there is the necessary number of Asians gets involved. And the Chinese government decides what's wrong with the whole rescue mission. Nice.Considering that neither NASA nor the Chinese can STILL fly anything worth a rat's jazz into space without the Russian-made tech, it is funny to see the whole story without any Russian involvement. Even the privately funded SpaceX program seems more effective these days than NASA! Nice political BS, holly-crap-wood.Look. I have given up expecting anything even closely serious from Hollywood. Yes, this movie is another all-time-low. Thank you for producing another piece of expensive garbage intended for people who practically kill one another on each 'black Friday'. I hope that those zombies enjoy this kind of BS. Ridley Scott, you, Sir, are a talent-less waste. Please, retire already. O&O.",1,63,124,18 December 2015
