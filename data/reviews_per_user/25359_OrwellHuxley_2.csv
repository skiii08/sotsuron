Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," The unnerving H. Zimmer soundtrack...
","...was the reason I gave this flick just 5 stars.This is not a western, Mr. Zimmer. And stealing from, err, quoting Mr. Morricone won't bring you any further. The story is OK, the special effects are awesome, and the acting is brilliant.Also, the restored London of the 19th century is just a spectacular sight. Marvelous! Anyway, 5 stars are OK.",5,2,4,27 August 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Deserved only 5 *s
","Now, why only 5 stars? The acting was OK, the setting was beautiful, and the camera work was quite brillant. Anyway, there were three flaws, three big mistakes which are inexcusable: Why for heaven's sake have the film makers used extra music for the soundtrack which has been recorded later than 1934?Duke Ellington recorded his 3rd effort on 'Merry-Go-Round' in 1935, Leo Reisman has waxed Cole Porter's 'I Get A Kick Out Of You' also in 1935, and 'The King Of Clarinet', Mr Artie Shaw, has recorded 'Any Old Time', featuring Billie Holiday, in 1938, during his very first recording session for RCA-Victor.That's why. Next time, please ask the experts for avoiding such kind of unnecessary anachronisms..",5,0,0,29 January 2018
