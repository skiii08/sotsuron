Blade Runner 2049," It's a replicant.
","Well, I tried to stay out of trailers and press and watch this with a clean slate.It is beautiful, great cinematography. Music isn't too shabby, tho it's no Vangelis either. Casting is solid, I like Gosling though the biggest impression on me probably made Bautista. Again.But the story... For some reason all modern sequels are not unique expansion based on established lore, but modernized replicas of what has already been a successful movie. Formula for writing sequel scripts in 2017 is - go to fan forum, read up everything people praise about original and stuff it into sequel then shake it, don't stir. And here's what this shake resulted with:Now the main guy is definitely a replicant, he's again stuck on artificial woman but she is now a hologram, he experiences the Dream but it's now a horse and not a unicorn... The main guy is also the main focus point for exploring the existential philosophy of an artificial life, the question that burdened our fallen angel, Roy Batty, so much. (This, however, is too prolonged, obvious and weak to be able to present the same emotional impact in 2017). The nasty, 'beat the crap out of you', part of Roy Batty is delegated to some random woman serving the Creator on the position of Rachel. Luckily for the movie, after doing its job of rescuing Harrison Ford for the final scene, the philosophical part of Roy Batty this time dies quietly alone caressing the snow (instead of caressing the dove). My biggest fear that he'd die one scene before in the rain and recite some haiku warp of Rutger Hauers original dialog was averted. Points for taste there.It isn't too bad, it just have too many 'nods' to original and too little of its own unique soul. It's a sad, modern replicant.",5,5,10,13 October 2017
Black Swan," Yin-Yang
","With 'Black Swan' Aronofsky presents the other side to his 'Wrestler'.While 'Wrestler' is a male, linear, lucid story of a guy struggling to get away from his everyday hell, 'Black Swan' is a female principle, dreamy, artistic, about a girl trying to set her dark side free.For me, the biggest asset of both movies are amazing performances of relevant leading actors, Rourke and Portman. Just amazing casting.As for the content, like every Aronofsky, this one is worth seeing. For me duality with 'Wrestler', ballet on screen, actors and directing are what makes it good, I could live without explicit sex scenes and occasional gore, but guess that wouldn't work with younger audience.Watch, but unless you're already a D.A. fan, don't get into theater expecting to be blown away.",7,0,0,19 March 2011
The Secret in Their Eyes," In 21st century, eyes still speak
","OK, frankly, I didn't expect much of this.I'm not familiar with Argentinian cinema, so this was my first acquaintance with director, writer and actors.Boy, what a surprise this movie made. It's beautifully filmed, it has lovely slow parts where director and actors narrate emotions through silence, this feature is almost vanquished from modern cinema where any frame that doesn't contain action is considered boring.I thoroughly enjoyed directing, but acting left me pining for Spanish classes. Impressive portrayal of characters if self-evident, with Soledad Villamil's performance shining out as an example of true actress. Unfortunately, we Spanish-impaired people can only sense the beauty lying within spoken lines and rhythm of the language that subtitles just cannot convey. As for violence and nudity they are used in glimpses, not more than necessary and in meaningful places, I spent good part of the movie fearing that it must eventually get ruined with some trendy shocker effect. But it doesn't, it flows it's own way beautifully to the end.If one can use small court office and a rape case to tell a love story in such subtle and profound manner it leaves me wandering what Argentinian cinema has for us for the future. I'll jump on digging through it's past right away, and I hope anyone wondering if this movie is worth their time can be swayed to yes side by my humble recommendation.",10,39,48,1 February 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," try that again
","Well I loved original Pirates very much. Second part had it's moments. So I was anxious for number three. First off, this is visually spectacular movie. I watched it twice and I'm bound to buy a DVD. It's adventurous and long, as I like it. But besides that it doesn't deliver too much. As for cast, Yun-Fat Chow is a great addition, Kevin McNally gives his standard enchanting side-kick part, and Geoffrey Rush is simply BRILLIANT, I'm really glad this sequel returns masterful captain Barbossa into play. On the other side Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are leading in their horrendous acting that's getting worse from sequel to sequel. My favorite Johnny Depp with the help of the script slowly but surely crosses the line in overacting his Jack Sparrow making it less and less attractive. Keith Richards role is superfluous although acceptable. As for the story, it repeats the standard mistake of sequels, trying to tie up all loose ends and reveal everything mentioned in all other parts. We all saw that before with Star Wars and dissection of Anakin Skywalker mystery, but obviously makers thought why not, it brings good money. Eternal love, eternal suffer, some story concepts sound good but are laid down too weekly and they miss the spot. Big adventure, but if I ask you who, where, why, what at the end of this movie, I doubt you could give me a coherent answer. So if you like pirate stories like I do, watch this movie for it's brilliant sets, costumes, photography and effects. What we could yearn for is masterpiece that this kind of visuals could bring if coupled with a better, more daring script. This could be a cult movie, forging and crafting peoples taste instead of blockbuster conforming to the bland average taste of masses. Well, let's wait for number 4 (pirates and the fountain of life as we learn), this movie is just good enough to make you crave for more...",7,0,1,13 October 2007
Avengers: Endgame," 3 hours of cringe
","Absolute deconstruction of original characters and the universe, this nonsensical circus seems only aiming to cram as much 'political correctness', painful attempts at humor and cheap pathos into torturous 3 hours.
One can only wish for infinity gauntlet to snap away the bad acting, horrible scenario and hollywood itself.",1,123,209,30 July 2019
Transformers," average
","actually, it's below average, but i'm a great fan of transformers so i can't give it less than 5. good, solid effects, but that's it. actors are mostly bland. kid (labeouf) is OK, turturro was a pleasant surprise and refreshment and voight gives his standard solid act. everybody else are mediocre at best. script? what script? this movie shouts 'robot porno', there are some lines thrown in here and there just to connect the 'action' scenes. my guess is that spending big budget on cgi forced creators to make story as watery and mass-appealing as possible to get the money back. and they've made it. story doesn't make any sense, gets pathetic too often and is full of holes. in fact, EVERY single dialog mentioning autobots and decepticons has some plot hole. in the year 2007, i find that unacceptable. if you are casual watcher and want a fun robot movie, don't let my review affect you, this movie WILL give you expected fireworks. but if you are transformers fan, you would probably cringe with me over the fact that big studios can't invest real emotion and passion into something legendary and beloved as transformers are. shame.",5,1,4,21 September 2007
Super 8," Drop dead Hollywood
","Kids witness a train crash that starts series of weird happenings in a small town. Doesn't sound too original, but expert storytelling really glues you to the chair, I love watching these kids obsess with zombie-movie making, great young actors, great character development. Adult support cast is solid too. Effects - flawless as can be expected at this day and age.Yes, this should be a GREAT movie. It really starts superbly and it keeps the pace till the last third. And then suddenly it fumbles. I suspect rewrites due to studio/producer pressure as usual. And that made ending nonsensically Spilberg-ish and dropped overall value of the movie to an average. What a shame.",8,1,2,4 November 2011
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Here's how not to do a sequel
","OMG, what a terrible sequel to one of the best movies of the decade...Shallow, unfunny, clich√©d, predictable and often pathetic, in many places poorly acted and directed, with overabundance of cheesy fake-looking rainbow effects.It's like writers read all viewer comments to Vol.1 then added whatever people liked 100 times over into Vol.2. So the lovely 80s music vignette now becomes massive bore shoveled into every scene, complex Yondu-Peter relationship gets butchered into cheesy pathos, Yondu's character gets reduced to repeating Vol.1 whistling scene over and over, Rocket goes boring with highlights being Vol.1 repeats, Gamora/Nebula relation - again repeats, Groot no development at all beyond Vol.1 ending cute cgi.The only character that actually gets improved is Drax, his lines are written and get delivered in the best manner of the first movie, unfortunately that can't keep this wreck afloat.",4,99,173,7 August 2017
The Fountain," Weak
","Flashy and entangled, this movie looks like it will bring you some wonderful message. But it will not. It will just present you with a mess that suppose to be alternative way to show same old corny story about love and sacrifice. Not many actors can pull such crappy scenario out of gutter, Jackman and Weisz fail too. Influence of 'Eternal Sunshine' is obvious, but this flick doesn't even come close. Empty, pathetic, obvious, it tries to be deep and emotional by throwing in lots of weeping, brain tumor and Mayas, nebulas and yoga. It just goes to show that you need an actual idea before you start to make a movie. Weak.",4,1,5,14 May 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," 21st Century John McClane
","Very good :) To begin explaining how much I'm pleasantly surprised with this movie I must say that I'm not a big Bruce Willis fan, I ain't impressed by his acting skills and I'm certainly not a worshiper of 'Die Hard' series. In fact I was AVOIDING watching this flick as I didn't expect anything but a dull Sunday afternoon action thriller.But as said, this is a huge surprise. 4th installment of the series is by far the best in my book. Like modern trends obviously dictate it, it's tough and brutal, gritty, action packed and masterfully filmed. Yes the story is somewhat loose and doesn't quite complement brilliant visuals, but hey, it's an action movie. Computer themed movies almost always have those huge gaps in stories, either from original scripts itself, or from those unavoidable simplifications necessary for movie to communicate with wide enough audience. And as this story unfolds it will thin out to the point of breaking near the end, with some overblown transformers-like scenes thrown in... But that's about all the bad; brilliant filming, impressive stunts and effects, very solid acting, adequate atmospheric score and many little thingies I'll leave out for your personal enjoyment, outweigh bad by far. Coming from someone that was bound to ignore this movie if not just plain hate it, this amount of satisfaction can only be summarized in two words - absolute recommendation :)",8,1,3,21 December 2007
Moonrise Kingdom," As bad as it can get
","As usual Wes Anderson's army of voters skew the votes on IMDb to push his latest movie. Of course in time the ratings will drop as with all of his other 'masterpieces' but at the time of this writing it's still glorious 8.3.How much it's really worth? 1, maybe 2 for Willis and Norton performances that were really solid. Leading child actors are bad and their script is even worse, they are like 2 kids heavily sedated forced to move around and speak lines. That might be Anderson's idea of quirky characters but it's just dull, pointless and boring. We had 2 gloomy kids in summer camp in Addams Family Values and it made more sense and was infinitely more funny. So, this is NOT a comedy. It may be a boring children drama, except there is no plot - you have two main characters going from one spot to another (repeat that 3 times) and others just following them.There is absolutely no value at all in this movie. Putting kids in front of the camera to french-kiss, touch each other and talk dirty might be 'artistic' in Anderson's head, but talentless writers often reach into cultural taboos trying to seem original, just showing a bad taste instead. Don't be tricked by rating, this is just like Darjeeling Limited - a plain bad over-hyped piece of trash. Willis and Norton characters are somewhat interesting as a starting point, and that's what probably drives most of the crowd into cinema to pay for this disaster.",1,20,43,22 September 2012
