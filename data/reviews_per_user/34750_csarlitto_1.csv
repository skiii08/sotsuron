","10 Cloverfield Lane: A Place to Remember 
This past Saturday me and a group of friends got together to watch a movie we had always wanted to. We saw on Netflix that a sequel to 10 Cloverfield Lane had come out and thought that it must be pretty good if they came out with another one. This 2016 movie, directed by Dan Trachtenberg, was a suspense/horror film stationed just around the time of the apocalypse. The main protagonist, a woman named Michelle, is in a car accident and wakes up to find herself chained to a wall in a nuclear bunker. The events that led up to and including all the different circumstances are slowly revealed throughout the movie. To many individuals, this may sound just like another horror movie where the main character makes obviously foolish mistakes that lead to this ultimate demise, but it could not be more different. Michelle thinks of every possible way to escape the grasp of her 'captors' but soon learns the truth about her situation. As the movie progresses we learn more and more about the characters and what they are all about. I found this movie entertaining, heart pumping, and thought provoking. I found it to be a satisfying mix between horror and suspense compared to some competitors. It was quite interesting to watch this woman and think, 'would I be able to think of something if I was in her position?' The movie ended on a fairly large cliffhanger and I am looking forward to seeing the next in the series.",8,0,0,6 March 2018
