National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Is this the start where Nicholas Cage goes of the rails?
","The first movie was a good, fun family movie, and this is too, though not as exciting or interesting as the first. Also, Cage gets a bit cagy, and it had me wondering if this is where he lost it a bit, before diving into b movie territory. There were a lot of hints here at possible sequels but I think Disney was done with this franchise, and thats too bad really, there was a lot of potential.",6,0,0,12 April 2020
First Man," The best astronaut movie I've ever seen!
","This was a great story, and a well done history lesson. I learned a lot that I didn't know about what led up to the moon landing, and all the actors involved did a great job. It had a lot of intense moments, and emotion as well. It all felt very real, and deserved all the award nominations it received!",9,1,1,9 August 2019
Alien 3," Should have been the end of a great trilogy
","What do I remember the most about alien 3? The ending (in the theatre) was great! I just rewatched the special edition, and they altered it, to be less dramatic/graphic. Alien 3 is much more like the original than part 2, and that's ok somewhat, but it's a big step backwards for action. It does have more tense moments, but the prisoners just aren't as memorable as the marines or original crew. Then of course, they made a fourth alien movie with Ripley which is silly, but I'll probably rewatch it soon. I actually liked the prequels more than most.",6,0,0,16 August 2019
Sucker Punch," A beautiful mess!
","The preview for this, originally, looked very cool and unique, and it is definitely the latter. There really isn't much story, but more like a few music video scenes followed by some video game escapism. Zack gets a lot of flack with his movies, but most of them at least look good. Also, a lot of people in this movie were nobodies, that having rewatched it now, I recognize, particularly Oscar Isaac who is practically an A list star now.",6,0,0,30 September 2019
The Equalizer," Nothing new here, but some great action
","Denzel probably invented walking away from an explosion. Too be honest, he's got a dad bod, but he's still kick ass. Is it confidence? Not sure, but it's always a pleasure watching him kick butt. What else to say? Soundtrack isn't too bad, and some shots are very stylish and cool looking. Watched this for the third time in anticipation of the sequel...which I won't see in the theatre even though I did the first. I do remember enjoying the tv show this was based on. Yet another reason to get some retro tv channel...",7,0,1,21 July 2018
Skyfall," A great visual Bond movie!
","This is the best since Casino Royale, and for a lot of reasons. The character development/shift of some of the team, the beautiful action scenes and stunts and adding to the mystery that is Bond himself. Javier is a great creepy villain, and Skyfall itself is not what I expected it to be, leaving more questions than answers.",8,0,3,2 July 2020
It," My favourite movie of 2017!
","I'm a huge Stephen King fan, and It has been near the top of my favourite books ever as well. Of course this movie only covers half the story, but it was very well done! Lots of changes, but that ok. The kid actors were great, and the clown was amazing. It almost feels like a cross between Stand By Me and The Shining. I can't imagine the sequel living up to this, but I hope it does. I hope they don't get too many famous actors because it's often is better with unknowns.",9,0,2,30 April 2018
Hereditary," All sorts of crazy!
","I'm glad I didn't hear any spoilers for this movie. It's not scary, but very creepy. There are a lot of moments where something is expected to happen and yet it goes a different direction, and that's where the good part is. I wasn't thrilled with the ending, but there were enough shocks in here to be quite enjoyable. It's not often I watch a movie and exclaim outlaid when something happens on screen, as I did with the first major shock.",7,1,2,13 September 2018
Train to Busan," Pretty good but not up to the hype
","I love horror movies, and this is on a lot of peoples lists, so I had to watch it. I'm kind of over zombies, so it didn't do much for me, as it's basically just zombies on a train. There is some good emotional moments, and some of the infected move in creepy ways...but I've seen a lot of better ones, so it won't be near the top of my list.",6,2,3,15 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Another great job by Marvel!
","I've seen every Marvel movie, and most of them in the theatre. They aren't always awesome, but they are very tightly packed with comedy and action. I love that they retrofitted this series into the current ones by dating it back to the 90's. It feels like cheating, partly, to fit her into the next Avengers movie, but I don't care. Brie Larson is great, as is Sam Jackson and Clark Gregg. My favourite bits were the chase seen on Earth. Other than that, it's a pretty good story, though I would have liked to see more hijinks with the Skulls. Hopefully they will do a Secret Invasion movie at some point. I don't know where I'd rank this in the Marvel movies though. Not near the top, nor the bottom, but definitely in the middle somewhere.",8,5,14,13 March 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A good continuation
","It's been awhile since I've watched any of these movies, but I felt like I'd watched this one the least and felt the need to rewatch it. It's quite entertaining, and the effects are very good. Overall it was better than I remembered it, though at 2.5 hours to still leave us hanging was a little irritating. Thanks to Disney Plus we'll be watching the next one soon. Of course none of these live up to the first movie.",7,0,0,11 April 2020
Madagascar," Still very good many years later!
","My kids were young when I first watched this. And watched it, and watched it. It was one of the movies that we owned and they loved watching again and again. And why not? Fun animals, escape from a zoo and find close to where they should be? Humor for kids and adults, and some songs that can worm their way into your head. I just rewatched it with my young niece and nephew who love it as well. The animation wasn't as crisp as I remember, but perhaps I'm thinking of some later movies, but this still stands the test of time.",7,0,0,11 May 2019
Us," A nice twist on a classic theme
","Invasion of the Body Snatchers with a spin. A very good cast, a fun soundtrack and a sore throat for the main actress in her double role. I'm sure this was a fun movie to make, and another good one from Jordan Peele.",8,0,6,16 March 2020
Knives Out," A very fun mystery
","I'm not usually fond of this type of movie, because its usually very obvious. This story telling is unique in that you know the answer immediately...sort of. But things twist and turn, and the cast is all good in the meantime. The best part is that of the probably least famous in the cast, which is the nurse. I just love the idea that she is so against lying that she vomits, which I thought might have been faked or deceiving at the start, but I'm glad it wasn't.",8,1,2,30 December 2019
Spider-Man 2," Easily as good as the first!
","These first two Spider-man movies are the best of the bunch. Dr. Octopus is a great villain, and most of the effects hold up really well. (Probably the least was Spidey swinging past cg helicopters etc at the end) The story is very good and I love the cast. I wish this quality could have continued through several more movies. My favortite scenes in both of these is when the people of New York back up Spider-man, which pulls at the heart strings.",9,1,3,12 November 2018
The Irishman," Good but too much hype
","A great cast, together again. The story is interesting but way too long. Would have loved more action, a few laughs. The acting is not fantastic by any means. The makeup effects are good but otherwise they just have angry or annoyed faces a lot. I don't see what all the fuss was about. If you like the Godfather series, you'll like this, but I also thought Godfather was boring.",6,1,2,10 January 2020
Hot Fuzz," Ridiculous fun!
","Simon Pegg tries so hard to be serious, but really this movie is anything but. A lot of laughs, a great cast and some fun over the top action. I saw this years ago and forgot pretty much all of it, so the ending was not what I remembered at all. Also Simon could give Tom Cruise a run for his money in an actual race, perhaps in the next Mission Impossible.",8,1,1,25 September 2018
Aquaman," An impressive feat for a movie that seemed impossible to make!
","Who ever thought Aquaman would get a movie? Or Guardians of the Galaxy or most of the other super hero movies we've gotten. Jason Mamoa is a big presence, but not the best actor, so DC surrounded him with great actors. This is a super cast, and a pretty good story, though it's pretty much what I expected, and a lot more stuffed in, just in case they don't get another chance. I think they will get to do another, but it's going to be hard because we've seen so much in this movie. This movie is fun, and well done, and also clearly a James Wan movie-for those Fast and the Furious watchers, there is a scene ripped right out of Fast Five. The main flaw, and it's hard to fault an underwater movie, is the overuse of CG effects. This is a problem with all DC movies, especially in the third act, and this one overly so. Marvel does CG too, but don't rely on it as much. But it's hard to help it, as I said, with so much under the sea. A lot of it looked great (hair flowing around, some of the huge explosions) Now that I've seen this movie competently done, I can't imagine what can't be done in movies, in the right hands.",7,2,3,3 January 2019
Deadpool 2," Nails the character, more fun than the first
","First thing I want to say before I forget, is that I think this director could make a good Mortal Kombat movie. There was a lot here that just got me thinking about it. This movie is better than the first. I like the added characters, especially Domino. I like the possibilities for further movies with some of them. The humour was very good, I especially like when he breaks the fourth wall. I also like a lot of the small in jokes for those of us who actually read comic books.",8,1,2,23 May 2018
Spider-Man 3," Not as bad as I remembered
","I know this movie gets a lot of grief, and truly it is the worst of the three. But it's not all bad. They tried to do too much, but they still did it fairly well. Sandman looked pretty good, and Venom wasn't the best, but it was still not that bad. I would have liked more monster Venom, but the way it affected Peter was true to the comics, even though emo Peter was kind of funny. I still prefer this to either of the Andrew Garfield movies. I would have liked this cast to stick around longer.",7,2,2,14 November 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Let's pretend part 2 never happened...
","The first Thor was a lot of fun, establishing the character and his universe. The second one was ok, but a step backwards, and to be honest I can barely remember it. This was a huge step up from part 2, and a lot of fun to boot, setting up the continued Avengers as well. Yes, it was partly a Planet Hulk movie, and I loved that part of it, yet having read that awesome comic, I would have liked a lot more of that. Cate Blanchett was a very good villain and the future looks interesting for the series. I hope there will be more. It was my favourite comic book movie of 2017! The director steals his scenes with a humorous character as well. What's not to love?",9,2,6,10 March 2018
Ready Player One," A geek and pop culture paradise
","First of all, go read the book if that title grabbed you. There is so much more that wasn't shown. Secondly, this movie is not for everyone. It is 80% computer generated, so if that's a problem, forget it. Third, if you love video games, the 80's and are looking forward to playing tons of VR stuff in the future, this is your movie. Some laughs, a great 80's soundtrack and unique visuals, but with a bunch of old characters and references that you'd never believe were mixed into a full length feature. I loved the book, and enjoyed the movie which I'm sure I'll watch again more closely to see all the hidden Easter eggs.",8,4,8,14 August 2018
The Hateful Eight," Definitely a Tarantino flick!
","It honestly took me awhile to get to this movie, and through it because its so long. Did it need to be so long? I can't imagine myself rewatching this anytime soon, but it was certainly entertaining. Again, with QT, you never really know what you're going to get, and this is true here. Probably the most dialogue heavy of his movies, and also the least action, but still entertaining enough.",7,0,0,12 April 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Quite a tale in this sad, sad world.
","There wasn't a lot of humour in this story, but the little there was, was welcome. As a Canadian, it's hard to imagine how racist other parts of the world can be. I know it was only based on a true story, but the fact is, there are awful people out there doing and thinking awful things towards each other. As a Christian, it scares me how racists can call themselves Christian. Being a Christian means loving God and loving everyone as yourself. This movie was very well done, and a great cast. Especially looking forward to seeing more of John David Washington.",8,1,6,12 June 2019
Final Destination 2," Slightly better than the first!
","I love these movies-an original horror series. The big crash at the beginning is so well done and better than the airplane from the first. Also, kind of lives a nightmare from my childhood car trips.",8,0,0,26 November 2019
Nacho Libre," Not for everyone but if you love Jack Black it's amazing!
","This movie was written for Jack Black, and nobody else could have pulled it off. It's unique and hilarious, and I quote it a lot. One of my favourite comedies of all time. Yeah, it's silly and not full of jokes, but it's more visually funny and awkward. Plus it has a lot of heart.",9,0,0,22 March 2020
Suicide Squad," Some fun characters surrounded by bad CG
","This story was a bit of a mess, but the fun characters can't be denied. Harley Quinn was perfect. Deadshot was pretty good, and most of the rest, except for the Joker. As is usual with DC comic movies, they struggle with villains, and overuse computer effects. So the first 3/4 of the movie was pretty good, leading up to a disappointing end that is chaotic and cartoony. Still, I enjoyed this more the second time, but truly it is only for hardcore comic book nerds like myself, but perhaps less picky ones.",8,0,0,8 September 2018
Elf," The best Christmas movie!
","There is only one movie I need to watch every Christmas, and that's Elf. I saw it in the theatre when my kids were tiny, and wasn't super keen on going, but ended up loving it. We've watched it every year since, which probably puts it up there as one of my, if not my most watched movie ever. And I don't know why, but I always get close to tears with the singing part near the end.",9,0,1,4 December 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Definitely Oscar Worthy!
","This movie is chaotic and full of surprises. Great performances and an interesting idea and story. I was not a fan of the language, or a lot of the parenting portrayed, but it did make it feel real. I haven't seen all of the nominated movies, but this one was interesting and different enough to put it above the ones I have seen this year.",8,2,5,4 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Were my hopes too high?
","I love Star Wars movies-even the prequels. With each trilogy, I like the first one best. I was excited for this one, and yet sad that its really the end. There was at least one small surprise in the story, but otherwise I expected more. As with The Last Jedi, I never got those goosebump feelings as I usually do. I must admit, people talking behind us took me out of it somewhat, and I had to yell at them to shut up. I'm sure I'll enjoy it more on a rewatch, but overall its still a very good movie. Just probably not in my top 5 of the series.",8,2,6,22 December 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Good but the sequels are so much better!
","I'm glad they told the origin story, and most of it was very good. A good villain and such, but the sci-fi elements took me out of it a bit, because they were unexpected. Chris Evans is perfect, and Agent Carter is also good-I'm glad she got at least a small series on her own. The first time in many years that I've watched it, because it's one of my least favourite of the Marvel movies, but still very good quality.",7,1,1,22 May 2020
Predator," Probably the manliest movie of all time!
","This is one of Arnie's best movies, and it still holds up quite well. There are some effects that are outdated, but otherwise it's still very good, and the only good movie with a Predator in it. The effects have improved in recent movies but they still haven't put one out that's as exciting as this debut. I'm curious with the new upcoming movie by Shane Black-who starred in this original. If you enjoy this, I'd Alien Vs Predator (the first one) is not too bad. Also Predators is ok, but I have yet to rewatch Predator 2. There are also a lot of really good comics with Predator in them, including crossovers with some super heroes.",9,1,1,4 August 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Music and Malek performance are 9, but story is 7
","I like the music of Queen and love the title song, but don't know a lot about the band. The story was quite formulaic, I really thought it would be more crazy. Great music and performances but not a movie I need to rewatch.",8,1,1,4 March 2019
Bird Box," If you liked A Quiet Place, maybe you'll like this too?
","Ok, one movie is about not making noise, the other is about not seeing things. Soon there will be a movie where people are starving because they are afraid to eat, or will start bleeding if they touch each other. This movie got a lot of hype, and it should, having Sandra Bullock in it and delivering it straight to Netflix. It's a good, tense thriller, with some gory bits. I enjoyed it a lot more than my wife did, but we were both happy with the ending. Was it amazing? No, but I'm considering giving the book a go, and it does give the imagination a workout.",7,0,1,5 January 2019
Hot Rod," Very silly but also somewhat fun
","I watched this with family years ago, when we really needed a laugh-and it was the perfect fit at the time. Rewatching it now, it doesn't hold up as well, but still has some magic to it. In the same category as Nacho Libre and Napolean Dynamite.",6,0,0,22 November 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A simply awesome epic!
","Having never read the books, I didn't know what to expect when I saw this in theatres. I certainly didn't think I'd fall in love with it, but I did. Of course I was in denial because people raved about the books and I thought it was overrated. I especially like the dark moments that I didn't expect. This movie is the best of the 3 and much better than the Hobbit movies, which shouldn't have been 3.",10,1,3,26 April 2020
The Thing," Among my top 5 movies of all time!
","I saw this movie as a kid, and loved it. It freaked me out, and the effects were awesome. I loved it so much I read the book, and owned it on VHS. Now I've watched it with my daughters, separately and they loved it too. The effects still hold up and it's still tense and exciting. And funnily enough, I wondered out loud if this movie is why I'm not a dog guy :P",10,1,3,1 July 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," An excellent Spiderman cartoon movie!
","Spider-man is awesome! I loved the Sam Raimi movies, even that third one somewhat. Then they switched actors up...and again. But I liked that the villains at least were new each time, and having been a long time comic reader, I enjoyed seeing a lot of recognizable alternate Spidey's. Some great humor, animation and not too bad music. The end was longer than necessary, but otherwise I'm looking forward to watching it again to see what I may have missed.",8,0,0,6 June 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," It's pretty rare for me to give 10 stars!
","This is one of those rare sequels that is better than the original movie, and the original was pretty darn good! I just rewatched this again, and it still holds up fantastically. The tension, the music, the effects and stunts. So much of this movie was just a perfect continuation from the first! Because these first 2 movies were so good, the studio keeps trying to get the story and magic going again. Most of the movies following this are ok, but I don't believe any will surpass or be as good as this one, though for the first time in awhile, I'm actually looking forward to the next-which I believe pretends the movies in-between never happened.",10,0,0,1 September 2019
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," This series is consistently awesome!
","Ok, that's not entirely true. I wasn't a huge fan of the first one, so all of these movies are better than the first. The last 2 in particular have stepped up the action and comedy quite a bit! A must see, and I'm excited for the new one in the theatre. This one has some particularly tense moments, especially the underwater portion.",9,0,0,11 June 2018
Spider-Man," Still one of the best comic book movies!
","16 years later, and this movie is still awesome! Superman used to be my favourite hero, but these movies helped change that to Spiderman. An excellent cast, including perfect casting for JJJ, Peter, MJ and the Green Goblin. In fact, I practically fell in love with Kirsten Dundst from this movie. One of the only minor flaws was the costume for Green Goblin, but Willem Dafoe makes up for that by being ultra creepy. Also was not a fan of James Franco in this movie, but I guess he kind of hits what the role was asking of him.",9,0,0,3 November 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A fun movie, but not quite Harry Potter
","Having enjoyed the Harry Potter books and movies, I felt the story had been told well enough, and didn't feel the need for prequels or sequels. So I was in no rush to see this movie. Finally, having seen a preview for the second movie, I felt it was time to watch the first. The previews had dissuaded me as well, because the creatures all seem to be CGI. And they probably are, but I still found myself enjoying the movie. Yes, there were too many computer effects, but the characters and old time setting were fun and well done. The music was also very good. Truthfully, this movie probably couldn't be made with practical, non computer assisted effects, so with what they accomplished, it's actually pretty good. Just not as good as the original series.",7,0,0,19 March 2018
Die Hard 2," A fun, similar action movie
","I gotta say, these movies are fun, but overrated. I probably liked it more when it came out, but rewatching it soon after the first, it fell flat a bit. The airplane scenes looked pretty good, but otherwise the action looks rushed and less professional. Bruce's attempt at humour and a lesser villain also take away a bit. Still fun, but filled with way more expletives than the first movie as well. Overall it was less memorable than the first, as are most of the sequels.",6,1,1,28 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," An amazing end to this series of Marvel stories!
","Never have I heard so much cheering in a movie. Also, there was a lot of tears from grown men. Not myself of course, but being a huge Marvel fan, I mostly knew what to expect. I've loved almost all of the movies leading to this, and this did them justice. Many great heartfelt moments, some good action and of course they always sneak the humor in somehow. Even my wife loved this, and she's stuck by me for most of these. I hope it breaks all the records, and I can't wait to see what direction Marvel goes next with whoever that may be.",10,1,4,28 April 2019
Mamma Mia!," I never thought I'd ever watch this, but I did it for the music
","This movie isn't actually as bad as I expected it to be. The music is catchy-(If you like Abba obviously) and it integrates into the story somewhat. Overall, I'm not a musical fan, but the cast seemed to be having so much fun, I guess I kind of did too.",7,0,0,22 September 2018
Toy Story 4," A lot of fun
","I never thought I'd see another Toy Story, with the original trilogy seemingly ending the story. But I'm glad I did. A lot of laughs and some emotion. Great new characters. I would really be surprised to see another one, I think this was a great way to end it, but I wouldn't complain if another came along either.",8,0,0,22 March 2020
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A big step up for the franchise!
","The stunts were better, the humour was better, the story was better. Having rewatched some of the early movies, which are all solid, this one did move forward, and that's a good thing! After this the stakes get upped every time, which is rare for a franchise this old, but I welcome it.",8,0,0,21 June 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," The Empire Strikes Back of Marvel movies!
","10 years of Marvel movies leading up to this-most of them very good. I've read the comics, so I knew what to expect, though I don't recall Guardians of the Galaxy characters in the original story. A lot of great action and surprisingly a lot of comedy still too! Spiderman had the best lines! A very good villain and overall super fun, yet darker movie. Not quite DC level dark, but emotionally I suppose. I did feel close to tears at one point actually, but it's because I've grown very attached to these characters. Of course it ended with a big cliff hanger to be continued next year, but I knew that going in.",9,1,2,30 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Definitely interesting but not Oscar worthy
","Most Quentin movies are interesting and unique. This one goes all over the place, with minimal plot. So much controversy with real life people, but when you look at the title, which includes Once Upon a Time, it really shouldn't be taken too seriously. Always a nice build up to the end, but not my favourite QT movie.",7,3,6,15 January 2020
Aladdin," A remake with some surprises!
","First of all, I was astonished that this is a Guy Richie film, because it's not his typical wheelhouse. Secondly, the trailers with Will Smith looked terrible, so I was in no rush to see this-not only that but he's no where near as funny as Robin Williams. But this turned out to be a pretty solid movie. Good cast, including Will who did better than I expected. Good singing and effects all around, with just enough changes/updates to the story.",7,1,2,29 March 2020
The Lion King," Very unnecessary reboot, but also very good.
","The Lion King is a classic that doesn't need messing with...but the result is very good anyhow. The scenery and animals look amazing, and the story remains much the same. The voice changes don't make a lot of difference aside from Timone and Pumba, which went a different direction but still worked out nicely. Because of the success of this, we are likely to see every animated movie upgraded...and that feels like a waste of time when it's nicer to see new original ideas...but is bound to make Disney a buttload of money anyway.",8,0,0,21 June 2020
A Quiet Place," Tense and somewhat unique
","Of course there have been similar stories before, where creatures hunt by sound, but this one is done in such a way that intensifies it. The use of silence and music really helps amp up the scenes. I would have preferred to see this in the theatre, but was unable to. A big, bold step up for John Krasiniski!",7,0,0,12 July 2018
Men in Black II," Nowhere near as good as the first
","I loved the first movie so much, it's impossible to live up to it. Lots of people loved it, so it obviously needed a sequel...but this one just doesn't have the same magic. Some of that being, Will Smith finding out and becoming an agent, which could've technically been repeated with another character in an amusing way. Also the villain is boring compared to the first movie. This movie is ok, and still enjoyable but part 3 was more entertaining and original.",6,0,0,7 July 2019
Coco," Pixar is back!
","I've seen and loved most of Pixar's movies. The only one I haven't seen at this point is Cars 3. The first half of this movie seemed very typical and I was almost bored, knowing the plot, but then it took an unexpected twist which made me enjoy it quite a bit! The music is great and catchy, and I didn't think they could outdo the colours of Up, but this movie is very colourful. Overall, it is excellent!",8,0,1,12 June 2018
Event Horizon," The Grand-Daddy of horror in space!
","I saw this in the theatre and loved it. Haven't seen it again until now, but have been wanting to. Some effects don't hold up, such as items floating in space toward the camera which makes me wonder if I saw it in 3D. The rest is as creepy and dark as I remembered. There are a lot of loud, noisy jump scares that feel unnecessary but technically tense the body for anything else that might happen throughout. Other than this and the Alien franchise, this genre hasn't been getting much love lately.",8,0,1,8 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Better on second viewing!
","I saw this in the theatre, and was slightly disappointed. I never felt the goosebumps or magic that I normally feel watching Star Wars movies. I think I was tired or distracted or something, because watching it at home I enjoyed it much more. The effects are amazing, as is the music. The story is good with some holes, but mostly good. I didn't love everything, but there were a lot of great moments and surprises, and I did get chills the second time. I'm excited to see where the next one goes. Overall, not as good as the originals, but better than the prequels. The Force Awakens was better, but I'm ok with that-I always thought A New Hope was better than The Empire Strikes Back as well.",8,5,21,16 April 2018
Jurassic World," I welcome reboot/continuation
","The first Jurassic park movie was epic, but the two afterwards were forgettable. Many years later, this reboot of sorts comes along and does a pretty good job getting us interested again. Some good action but some unlikable characters. Of course the dinos all look great.",7,0,1,1 November 2019
A Bug's Life," One of Pixar's best! Underrated!
","This is an early Pixar movie that never got a sequel, but should have. It's a great story with heart and bullies and revenge, and even a princess! The animation doesn't hold up as well as some later movies but the story, characters and humour are great. One of my favourite Pixar movies!",9,1,1,1 January 2020
Logan," A great final story for Hugh as this character!
","The R rating makes a difference, because this character is typically more violent in the comic books. But it's not just that, it's an emotional story with other old characters and newly introduced ones. I've always loved this character and Hugh Jackman was perfect for the role. I really hope they don't recast this character going forward, at least anytime soon.",9,4,6,10 November 2018
Men in Black," One of my favourite movies!
","I watched this so many times on DVD, I thought I must be sick of it. Years later I just rewatched it and I still love it. None of the sequels can hold a candle to this near perfect sci-fi comedy. Will's best role, and Vincent is one of the best and most unique villains ever. Sadly the series hasn't been great after this, though part 3 is much better than 2. I give out very few 10's but this one deserves it.",10,1,1,29 June 2019
Midsommar," This movie was overhyped and probably ruined it for me
","Hereditary was a unique new horror that I enjoyed, and this being the second form the filmmaker, I was curious. I'd heard it wasn't as good, and yet its been getting rave reviews all year. I finally got a chance to watch it, and its...interesting. A very slow start but once it gets going, it gets crazy fast. Not necessarily good crazy. Some surprises, some things predictable. Some hard to watch. Overall, I'm glad I finally saw it...but not sure if it'll sneak into my top 10 this year or not.",6,0,4,30 November 2019
Drag Me to Hell," Sam Raimi goes back to his horror roots!
","This movie is so obviously Raimi. It's got the sound effects, and visuals and humor! As dark as the title makes this seem, it is kind of shlocky fun. I don't remember seeing Alison Lohman before or after this movie, but she is perfect in this role. Cute and unassuming but gets stronger as the movie goes on. She takes a lot of abuse, mostly gross stuff happening to her. One of my favourite horror movies of the last 10 years!",8,2,2,24 October 2018
Groundhog Day," One of my very favourite!
","My wife and kids think it's boring, and I've never met anyone who liked it as much as me. It ignites my imagination as to the possibilities of reliving the same day. Other tv shows and movies have been inspired by it as well. I think it's funny, dark, and sometimes moving. It's not perfect, but it's close.",10,1,1,16 March 2019
National Treasure," An entertaining, but flawed family movie
","There is a good amount of fun action here, and the story is ridiculous but not too bad. This is probably where I first fell in love with Diane Kruger. The sidekick is good fun, and Sean Bean is always a welcome villain, but this could never be close to Indiana Jones.",7,1,1,5 April 2020
Don't Breathe," Tense but predictable.
","I kept waiting for someone to say Don't Breathe at some point. This movie is exactly what is expected of the title. It's got a lot in the dark, and a lot that is quiet, and that makes for some good suspense. But the ending was never in much doubt. The actors look frightened enough and Stephen Lang is suitably creepy.",7,0,0,14 November 2018
The Shape of Water," Not Del Toro's best. Pan's Labyrinth should have gotten an Oscar instead!
","Most of the time you know what you're getting with Del Toro's movies. This time he throws some love in there, which was probably unexpected to start, but has been spoiled by everyone everywhere. The movie was well done, but did not deserve best picture. I would have much preferred an origin story where the creature is first found/captured etc, instead of a woman falling in love with it. But it is interesting and definitely different. I would have given best picture to Three Billboards this year instead, but hey, I'm glad he's getting some more recognition because he does deserve it!",7,2,14,24 March 2018
Zombieland," Better than I remembered
","I saw this movie when it came out, and I remember enjoying it. Just rewatched it with the sequel coming up, and probably liked it more this time. The soundtrack was good, their were some good laughs and good action. Also, the first time I was unaware of a scene after the credits.",8,0,0,4 September 2019
Die Hard," Probably Bruce Willis's best movie!
","A great, classic action movie that holds up very well today! Alan Rickman was a great villain, and the whole building set was perfect. A few laughs, and some references to his buddies Arnold and Sly Stallone.",9,0,0,4 May 2019
American Made," A true story made fun
","I'm sure not everything is correct in this movie, but it's partly true, and very entertaining. The flying portions are very well done, and I like that there is some humour in it. It would have been nice to see subtitles whenever someone was speaking Spanish, but there were only a few lines that actually were which had us wondering a lot.",7,0,0,1 March 2020
The Witch," More disturbing than scary
","This is an old tale, and one well done. It starts out strong, and works it's way up in horrific scenes. The music is distracting but probably the scariest bit, getting you tense. The ending wasn't my favourite, but all in all, it was unique and well acted tale, but creepy story. Do not watch if children in peril bothers you!",7,5,8,23 January 2019
Joker," An excellent character study/origin story
","What? Why didn't I give this a 10/10 like everybody else? This movie is great, and very well put together, with a great soundtrack and excellent performances, especially for the title character. But it's also exactly what I imagined it would be, right down to the ending. Also it's dark for a comic book movie, (not as dark as I thought it would be though) but dark enough that I'm not sure how many times I would watch it. Can I recommend this to comic book lovers? Yes, but not if they are expecting a happy movie. Easily in my top 5 this year, but I'm afraid it still can't beat Endgame for me, but those characters I've invested in for 10 years.",8,1,6,14 October 2019
Pitch Perfect 2," A pretty good sequel
","I don't usually watch movies back to back, but having just finished the first movie, my family wanted to jump into the second. The characters are still good, and they do grow somewhat, but the music isn't as catchy as the first movie. I liked some of the other groups from around the world, particularly the German rivals, so that added a bit to the movie. Also fewer laughs than the first, but still pretty solid.",7,0,0,4 February 2018
Die Hard with a Vengeance," I like this one as much as the first!
","Sam Jackson and Bruce Willis make a great pairing. In fact, there is a scene in here where Bruce is coming off a crashed subway, where you just know M Night was watching and came up with Unbreakable. The villain isn't as good this time, but the villainous acts are. This is pre 9/11 and there is all sorts of explosions and crazy driving throughout New York. Highly entertaining and less cheesy than some of the others in the series.",8,0,0,23 September 2019
It Chapter Two," Pretty much what I expected
","I've loved the book for years, and It Chapter 1 was my favourite movie the year it came out. This one doesn't live up to that one, but is still a pretty good follow up. The adult actors are pretty good comparisons to the kids, and I especially liked Bill Hader. There is a great cameo by Stephen King, poking fun at himself. I wish there were more scares. The best scenes in this and the first, are always when the kids are separated with Pennywise. Overall, the kid scenes are always more fun, as are the 80's.",7,0,1,7 September 2019
Parasite," A very unique and fun movie!
","I tried going into this movie with as little information as possible, and I'm glad I did. The title definitely threw me off, thinking that it was a horror of some sort. Turns out it had a lot of comedy and drama. Great characters and very original. I wasn't a huge fan of the way it ended, it felt like a bit more time could have made a difference, but overall I think it deserved a lot of the awards it got.",8,1,3,24 February 2020
Wonder Woman," One of the better DC movies!
","First of all, Gal Gadot is perfect in the role, and a treat to watch. Secondly, when I first saw this in the theatre, I quite enjoyed it up until the end, where I felt overwhelmed my computer effects. That part didn't seem to bother me as much at home, and I'm glad for that, because the first half of the movie is great, and then it downturns a bit but is still pretty good. I would love to see more of Paradise Island, because that, and Wonder Woman on the battlegrounds, were the best two parts. So basically, I'd love to see more stunt work than special effects.",8,3,5,16 July 2019
Marriage Story," Some great performances but...
","I think most people know what this movie is about. It could be titled Divorce story just as well. Adam and Scarlett are great, but its a sad movie, and one I probably won't watch again. A very good supporting cast as well, and the characters certainly feel real.",7,3,6,17 December 2019
1408," Needed more scares and less drama
","I enjoyed this a lot when I first saw it, but not as much many years later. I seem to have remembered more stuff happening, but perhaps that was in the short story. Some good effects, and ok performances, but I'd like a remake of this one.",6,0,1,29 October 2019
Black Panther," Same old Marvel, but also different!
","Black Panther had a great introduction in Captain America:Civil War, but having read comics all my life, I still didn't know a lot about him. I didn't know Wakanda was so ahead of the world with technology, or any of the character lore. Yes, this is kind of an origin story, but it's done in a way that it doesn't necessarily feel like it. The scenery is beautiful, and the characters are great. The women really kick butt, and the villains are very good. Andy Serkis especially seems to have a lot of fun with his role. I didn't really expect humour, but as with Marvel tradition, there is a good amount as well. Overall, a fun continuation of the dominating Marvel movies, and yet another that I will add to my collection!",9,1,8,20 February 2018
Iron Man," A near perfect comic book movie!
","I still remember when this was announced to come out, I really didn't have a lot of faith in the character making the jump to the big screen. I was pleasantly surprised, and rewatching it now, it is the best of the Iron Man trilogy by a good amount. Also kicking off Shield and the whole Avenger universe. Extremely well done story and effects, with a good portion of heart and humour.",10,1,2,6 April 2020
Mother!," Worst movie I've seen in awhile...
","I like dark movies, sometimes even disturbing movies. This one has been talked about a lot, and I needed to see for myself. The trailers are strange, and the movie is stranger. I was enjoying it up until the last half hour when it just got chaotic and nonsensical, even to the point of absurdity. I feel like the director had his start and his finish planned out and believed he could throw anything in the middle but still wrap it up neatly. It just felt lazy to me, and some scenes just went over the top into ridiculous territory. I was really surprised that these actors even signed on for this. I could only recommend this to my most disturbed friends...",3,0,0,11 July 2018
Casino Royale," One of my favourite Bond movies!
","I've always loved James Bond. Great stunts and villains, some cheesy womanizing. This movie makes the character much more serious, and the stunts to another level or realism. Daniel Craig does a great job of re-inventing the character. Like Pierce Brosnan's Bond, this first one is also the best of Daniels.",9,1,3,27 October 2019
Pitch Perfect 3," So much less than the first 2...
","These movies are fun, especially the musical moments. The story shouldn't matter, and doesn't really, but this one is just less funny. The first one was fresh and hilarious. The second one almost kept up with the first, but this one just went off the rails. It's still fun, but I don't think I'll remember it.",6,0,1,20 January 2019
Speed," Crazy over the top action!
","This movie still holds up incredibly well many years later! Some parts are incredibly ridiculous and impossible, but the action and chaos can't be denied. Dennis Hopper is a great villain as well. Original and fun!",8,1,1,29 July 2019
Live Free or Die Hard," Consistently entertaining!
","This series has it's silly moments, but you can't deny the action. Yes, it's over the top and ridiculous, but it's fun. The villain here is pretty good, and Justin Long brings some humour to it. Even the daughter is pretty good. If they keep making these movies, I'll keep watching them.",7,0,0,5 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I love this movie, almost as much as the original!
","I was so excited when the prequels came, having always loved the original trilogy. I was a bit disappointed with them, but still enjoyed them. This movie brought back the magic of the originals, with a fresh cast and goosebumps at the returning characters. Not a perfect movie, but an awesome and welcome edition to the saga!",9,4,19,1 December 2019
Final Destination," An original idea that became a fun horror series!
","I loved this movie, and all the movies that followed it. The whole idea of cheating death, while it's trying to kill you in a variety of ways is cool. I'm rewatching them all, I'm sure some of the later ones are better than this first, but it gets extra points for being first.",8,0,0,31 October 2019
Pitch Perfect," Good music and laughs
","I'm very late to this series, having dismissed it as a teen girl movie. Of course, my teen daughters loved it. When it got a third movie, I thought it might be worth trying out. I was pleasantly surprised! A very good cast with some great music numbers. It wasn't the typical trashy college movie, so it can be enjoyed by the whole family. Also there were a few great laugh out loud moments.",8,1,1,4 February 2018
Fast Five," Still my second favourite of all of them
","My favourite is still the first movie, because there would be no others without it. Part 2 is good, Tokyo Drift is ok, and part 4 is the most forgettable. So the series was going downhill fast, but came way back up for this one. I originally saw it in Imax which is the best way to see it with the scenery of Rio. Awesome action, crazy car scenes and a vigorous shot of adrenaline from The Rock that really helped out the series.",9,1,1,10 July 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Going for the violence record?
","I enjoyed the first John Wick movie, as a popcorn action flick. The idea of a safe haven hotel is great, and has since been copied (upcoming Hotel Artemis for example). The action is great, with cool cars and gun-fu, which is surprisingly gory. This second movie continues where the first one ended, but has less story than the original, which isn't saying much. Some good fights and over the top shooting make me wonder why this isn't already a video game franchise! And of course a new one is in the works, which I'll watch but not in the theatre.",7,1,2,28 May 2018
Annihilation," A fun, somewhat original sci-fi
","I enjoyed this movie, mostly for the visuals. Great landscape shots, colouring and creature/plant effects. It reminded me a lot of some video games, like The Last of Us. Acting was ok, and the ending was also ok. I would have liked more of everything, so I'd absolutely watch a sequel. Or maybe I should read the books it's based on...Still, it's in my top 5 already for 2018.",8,0,2,18 June 2018
Incredibles 2," I loved this, but it can't compare to the first
","The first Incredibles movie was darn near perfect. Probably my favourite animated movie, at least in the top 5. The sequel is great, and I'm glad they took the time to make it good. The best moments were the parenting moments that I felt (not a spoiler, in the trailer) 'They changed math?' and falling asleep reading to the baby. Of course the action and humour were there as well, and the highlight being Jack-Jack's rotating powers. I've loved and seen all of Pixar's movies and look forward to the next one.",8,1,1,16 February 2019
Donnie Darko," Still holds up pretty well!
","I watched this again, for the first time in years, and it's still pretty good. It's fun to watch these older movies and see actors when they were younger who've become more famous now. The effects aren't super, but the story is still there. The high school feels real, and I'd forgotten a lot of the plot points. Definition of a cult movie!",8,0,2,24 March 2018
Beetlejuice," Loved it as a kid, but doesn't hold up well.
","I saw this in the theatre as a teen, and loved it. The cast and music are great, but the effects don't hold up. Claymation, which Tim Burton has used a lot in his movies, just doesn't translate well anymore, to me. It's weird rewatching this now and seeing how young the cast were.",6,0,2,14 September 2019
