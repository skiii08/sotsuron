It," Disappointing
","Im a huge fan of the original clown Pennywise played by Tim Curry. He was delightfully playful, yet cynical and creepy. The film used to scare the crap outta me when I was a kid. and will forever hold a space in my movie collection.That being said, this film will NOT!I had high expectations for 'It'. Eagerly awaiting its release for months. I wanted to see the Clown Pennywise with visual effects that the 80's could not produce. Much like the 'Nightmare on elm street' made in 2010, changes were made to modernize which, filmmakers hoped, would make the film more interesting but had the opposite affect. Pennywise himself...wow, horrible. I'll give you a quick example: There's Michael Keaton's Batman(amazing), and then there's Christian Bale....yeah, its like that. Why change a good thing? The way I see it, keep things simple, don't veer too far off from an already great story or fans of the original will rip you a new one. Its worth a red box rental, bout it.",5,2,7,18 September 2017
