Skyfall," Worse James bond movie ever
","This is my first review and the reason why I take the time to write this review is because I paid 7 euros to watch this movie in IMAX, but I felt that my money was not worth it. In general the whole plot is confusing and childish. I can't make up my mind whether this is an action movie or a drama or even a comedy. The script jumps from one section to another without cluing any of the parts together. As in all opening scenes of a Bond movie also in this one there is a good opening until the chase starts. There everything goes wrong and the director obviously had no idea how things work in Turkey. The scenes on the rooftops were badly made and one could notice the obvious computer editing - not really anybody was driving on these roofs apart from couple of scenes. The market scenes were impossible and unrealistic and the way the train scene ended totally ridiculous. Turkey is such a militaristic country that if NATO intelligence would be in stake the train wouldn't get even 1000 meters further from its departure without a dozen of helicopters and army commandos -fitter than Bond - chasing it. The chances that Bond would ever never survive a fall to shallow Turkish river are nonexistent. And if even if he would have done that either the Turkish authorities or the British intelligence would have him located instantly. Absolutely no way to get away from there.Despite all these childish errors I still liked the opening scene mostly because what follows was tragic. Once the movie goes to the dialogues of the executives it becomes ridiculous. I am sorry but even in my office we use way more professional attitude at work than what M and her boss used in that movie. However even more ridiculous is that someone wants to execute M but instead gives her a chance to see only her office blowing in order to impress - really story for children. But the nonsense doesn't stop there. When eventually Bond remembers that his country needs him because his bosses office is blow he decides to give up the life of a looser to get back to work. So the director likes to give us a message, die for your boss but not for your country - because otherwise there would be one million reasons for Bond to get back his ass earlier than he did.Indeed despite that Bond is physically ruined and mentally incompetent the office would assign him to trace the assassin responsible for the killing of fellow agents like there's nobody better to do the job. And when he finds the guy, instead of calling backup - because the assassin is literally trapped in a skyscraper with maximum security- he goes with the acrobatics and lets even another person die just to be left with a casino chip in hand. I will skip the casino scene because it is only ridiculous, full of meaningless dialogue, bad acting and clich√©s seen in almost every action movie. In the next part Bond gets finally to the island where the bad guy is located. The bad guy who so far has been extremely smart turns to be a total idiot, living in an isolated island, very easy to be traced, surrounded with a bunch of muscled buffoons and turns also to be a gay. I didn't get the point of the last, but they obviously had to do something to distract the overall contradiction of the whole setup. The bad guy is caught and thrown to a cell that looks similar to the one Dr.Hannibal Lecter was put in the Silent of Lamps, apart that it isn't the same impressive and very unpractical and would have cause a number of security issues with its design. The bad guy has unimagined programming skills manages to get the British Intelligence computer systems virus infected to just to escape in order to find and kill M. I have a big question, why he couldn't do all that earlier when he was free and very powerful?Finally we come to the point where every single level of authority in England must have been paralyzed with only Bond and his battler or uncle or whatever he was the only able people to help to save M. And the best place to do that is a spot which can be seen and traced so easily like no other. Furthermore that bad smart guy turns totally stupid when instead of bombing the whole place to the ground he decides to promenade around it throwing gradates through the windows.The closing scenes are lacking any kind of emotion compared to the ones of older Bond movies. They seem more like a quick and dirty way to get us to the next Bond movie where there is a new M and probably also another Bond actor. I gave only four points because of the camera work, the music and the acting of Ralph Fiennes who I am sure will be the best M ever in the Bond movie to follow.",4,20,41,29 October 2012
