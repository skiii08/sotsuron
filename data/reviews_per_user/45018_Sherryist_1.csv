Marie Antoinette," Wanted to Love But
","Someone once said this is the movie you want to love but just can't. Overall if you take simply the plot out of the movie you're left with nothing more that a fictionalization story somewhat accurate but not really about Maria Antonia. It's like Kristen Dunst gets to play dress up for 2 hours and eat strawberries, oh and nothing else happens, say like the French Revolution and their deaths. Even if you say, oh well these were the events leading up to that, no, they're not the events leading up to that. So no, not true. They play MA as if she had no power and no ambition at all and that all of her motives came from a place as innocent as KD would have you seem. Sure. What's troublesome about this old movie is the need for Sohpie Coppola to make everyone believe that MA partied it up and the only reprocess ion from that was that she had to leave her house. She also had an affair and the only repercussions from that were that she and the king lived happily ever after.",4,0,0,21 March 2015
