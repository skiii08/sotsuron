The Blair Witch Project," The single most ovverrated movie in history.....
","This movie promises to be realistic and oh so scary.The only scary part is that I actually paid to watch tihs crap!You keep waiting and waiting for somethind,ANYTHING to happen,but it never does!At least Heather Donahoue could have been seen taking a little nude bath in the creek,anything to keep me interested.A total waste of time and effort!The filmakers' tried their best,but they just lacked the skill an experience to make a good movie.For some reason film critics really liked this amateur effort.Maybe because the idea was fresh and this type of film has rarely if ever been tried in the past!I liked the effort,but the production was awful as was the flick.",5,0,2,1 March 2004
Resident Evil," A 21ST century version of....
","A 21ST century version of George Romero's series of Zombie movies.Night of the living Dead(1969),Dawn of the Dead(1978),and Day of the Dead(1984).It follows all of the zombie movie rules laid out earlier.But,Mila Jovovich looks good enough to eat so it is worth a look for those interested in this genre.",Null,0,0,1 February 2004
Pulp Fiction," This Movie is SICK!!!!
","The line that Tarantino himself says,'Is there a sign in my yard that says,I want niggers' with their head blown off !'is just as great as this movie is!Natural born killers is awesome,but this movie may be even better!Everything about it is sick and un-politically correct.One of the 10 best of the 90's!",10,1,2,15 February 2002
