Ford v Ferrari," Took my breath away
","James Mangold somehow turned what could potentially be a boring subject into one of the best films I have watched all year. Utilizing the strength of its cast and buoyed especially by a superb Christian Bale, this film was a true crowd pleaser.It was exciting from start to finish and the race sequences had my adrenaline pumping and had sweat rolling down my forehead. The sounds in this movie is superb and definitely adds to an immersive experience. This film, despite its run time, was never boring. Two hours and thirty minutes simply flew by watching this.A well directed film from start to finish. You have to see it in cinemas for the complete experience.",10,6,13,20 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Rather enjoyable if uneven finale to the decade spanning skywalker saga
","After the fallout that is The Last Jedi, JJ Abrams and the makers of this film had a near impossible job of pleasing the fan base and tying up the Skywalker saga. The effects of this is a largely uneven first act where the story goes everywhere as the film frantically tries to lift off.There are some very poor character decisions in this film that tried outright too hard to strip away the doings of The Last Jedi. I found that incoherent and though The Last Jedi made some questionable decisions, I would have enjoyed a film that tried to build upon The Last Jedi, instead of outright destroying it, as that would have surely made the trilogy a more cohesive and logical one.While the first act jumped from one set piece to the next, giving us no time to explore and develop our characters, the pacing improved from there and delivered a divisive but satisfying ending that grants a re-watch.As the end of the sequel trilogy, this film fail. But viewed on its own, this film is a worthy fan-fiction-like companion film to the originals.",6,2,5,24 December 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Marvel-lous film
","A very well made film that somehow manages to keep order within all the chaos. Given such a large cast, the Russo Brothers managed to make the film feel smoother than a ton other films in the MCU and delivers the thrills and the chills that are beyond any other in the MCU. The cliffhanger is shocking and leaves us asking for more. Well, here's to another year of waiting.",8,1,4,5 May 2018
The King," Dry, Bland and Disappointing
","'The King' is a long, boring but beautifully shot film that was rather disappointing to me. Honestly, I expected more going into a film that promises genuine character building in front of a medieval backdrop. The director clearly had great vision for this film but was unfortunately dragged down by a tedious and tiresome plot. Though I enjoyed Timothee Chalamet's performance as King Henry, he often seemed confused by his character's principles and motivations as the script insists of creating shocking, yet out of character moments, for him.",4,8,12,22 November 2019
Marriage Story," One of the best films of 2019
","This film is everything a Drama film should be. A terrifically conceived and directed film, Marriage Story dived deep into a story about a divorce and gave us an authentic look behind the love, hate, emotion and pain of the process. Buoyed by a superb performance from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, this film gave us the character depth one can only dream of. This is a must-see film not just of 2019, but I dare say, of all time.",10,6,9,8 January 2020
Incredibles 2," The Incredible Incredibles
","Incredibles 2 proves to be another hit for Pixar and Disney. Released 14 years after the original, this film picks up from where the last film ended, and it never stops to take a breath. The action sequences are exhilarating and fun to watch, aided by a clear improvement in animation technology.Incredibles 2 can never be as innovative as its predecessor, yet it keeps the heart and the fun of the first film. The story about a family of superheros sets it apart from the comic book films, giving us interesting family dynamics and everyday problems that all families face, which feels organic and human, allowing all of us to relate to this family and allows us to see them as not just superheros, but ordinary families trying to live their lives.All compliments aside, the villain, Screenslaver, in this film was surprisingly weak and never much of a threat, due to a lack of opportunity for Screenslaver to truly develop itself. Unlike Syndrome in the first film, this villain never challenged the ideals and beliefs of any member of the family, although you could see where the villain is coming from, adding moral ambiguity, a characteristic of most Pixar films.In addition, so many ideas about politics, commentaries about the justice and fairness are introduced throughout the film. While relevant, it can't help but feel over-saturated with different kinds of messages it wants to bring across. In the end, although the film was a fun and enjoyable time at the theaters, the muffled message makes the journey slightly frustrating.",7,1,6,15 June 2018
