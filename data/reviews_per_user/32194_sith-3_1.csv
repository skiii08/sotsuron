Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Magic is Alive and the Force is as Powerful as Ever
","When Star Wars hit it transported viewers to a wonderful place and time that was beyond imagination.  A land of magical forces, good versus evil, powerful fates, and endless adventure.  For all the years after it's sequels we've been longing to return again. The wait is over and it's as grande and engulfing as ever.  The movie cannot be described, it must be felt.  If you are among the legions who love 4, 5, and 6, then you will be in heaven.  Actually, better yet, a galaxy far, far, away.   It is adventure, myth, action, character, heart, soul, and dreams in the most glorious potpurri possible.  Once again our hearts can sour and minds fly to faraway places.  Once again we meet the Jedi in all their glory.  Once again the Force is truly  with us.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
