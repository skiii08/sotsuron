Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Wakey Wakey!!! Eggs and Bakey...
","Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' hits home with the writing guns blazing! The whole movie is an exercise in homage to two particular genres of film: the spaghetti western and kung fu. The film is remarkably introspective and its characters reach a depth that they were not allowed to in 'Vol. 1.' Especially during the final scene between 'the Bride' and Bill, and their daughter, whom 'the Bride' did not know was alive. The final confrontation between 'the Bride' and Bill, although abrupt, is so powerful that it leaves the audience stunned. Combined with excellent cinematography and a hip soundtrack, 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' along with 'Vol. 1' is an epic that will not be forgotten.",10,0,1,31 January 2005
The New World," 'The New World' is a marvelous film built on reflective images through both its cinematography and narration.
","The story of Pocahontas and her relationship with John Smith has long been renowned in early American history. The common misconception is that she and Smith were lovers. This notion has been played upon in literature and even popular family entertainment such as Disney's 1995 movie, 'Pocahontas.' Terrence Malick's new film, 'The New World' takes that road, as well. However,it never becomes a sexual relationship; at least not that we ever see. The characters at most share a kiss from time and time and admit they love one another. The film's producer, Sarah Green, defends this by implying that the filmmakers wanted to maintain an element where the film combines the actual history with the mythology of Pocahontas' life. The implied love between Smith and Pocahontas is highly effective in telling the story. The love story is what drives her to help the colonials and to persuade her future choices to marry Rolfe and go to England. In the end, we see a woman who is more than a lover and a diplomat, but a truly courageous and open minded individual who bridged the cultural gap between nations. The basic facts are known about Pocahontasshe and Smith were friends and she helped the Jamestown colony by providing food during the harsh winter. But 'The New World' goes beyond the fundamentals and delivers her entire life. Smith eventually is sent back to England on an expedition to the Northern American lands for the King. Pocahontas is eventually captured by the colonials as leverage between the then warring English and as the films refers to, Naturals (Natives). During that time, Pocahontas assimilates into the English culture through style of dress and the like, while never forgetting her past. She eventually meets John Rolfe, marries him and has a son. They go to England where she is received by the King and Queen and are treated as royalty. She eventually dies of disease. What separates this film from being a documentary is how it is crafted. 'The New World' is a film built on reflective images through both its cinematography and narration. The cinematography often focuses on the wind in the trees, the flowing of water, the changing of the seasons, sunrises and sunsets. Not at any time does this film succumb to being a common entertainmentit is not built on useless action scenes or unnecessary violence. Nor does it pursue any sexual element between either love stories involving Pocahontas with Smith or Rolfe. After all, when she met Smith, Pocahontas was no more than 14 years old. Still the film is glorious to observe. Its narration, perhaps the poetry of a journal or the ramblings of characters in their elder years, brings an evocative feel to the picture. It is as if director Malick wants the audience to feel the passage of time as the characters did. Moreover, the film asks us to slow down and appreciate elements of nature before a time when development would take over these lands. We are immersed in shots of the forests, the rivers that lead to the ocean and of the sandy beaches of the Virginia coastline. Combined with the musical score of composer James Horner, this being the finest score he has produced since 'A Beautiful Mind,' the film takes on a form of escapism like no other film of 2005. Pocahontas is played by newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher in a very fine performance. She plays the young princess with subtlety showing the free-spirited antics of a young woman combined with a maturity beyond her years. Colin Farrell plays Smith with finesse. He represents the famed British soldier with a warrior's drive combined with the mind of appreciation for the new world he is discovering. In other scenes, he portrays the care he feels for Pocahontas through expressionism. In one particular scene, he comes to the realization that any pursuit of a future with Pocahontas is out of the question. We see his eyes well up and his somber countenance evoking a deeper, inner sorrow. Even more credit needs to be given to Christopher Plummer's short performance of the leader of the English crew at the film's beginning. Plummer has a presence of authority that few actors command. His constant dignified look and manners or speech represent not only those of a refined character, but of a refined actor. Also, Christian Bale is terrific as Rolfe. His love for the native princess is disheartened by her grief over loosing Smith and leaving her people. But the character never becomes enraged or jealous of Smithhe is a gentleman and will not be reduced to that level. He loves her and understands that her relationship with Smith was something that he could not be. Bale portrays this performance with the class of veteran actors like Michael Caine. Incidentally, Bale played a voice in Disney's 1995 'Pocahontas' as one of the English settlers. The very title signifies more than the new world that the English found. It represents the new world that the native princess would find herself in, and every new world that she would encounter on the road of her short, yet amazing life.I have always noted that film is an expression of life. 'The New World' is a film that expresses a different kind of life, in a different time amongst diverse individuals. Regardless of whether or not an intimate relationship existed between Smith and Pocahontas is a myth that is disputed by countless historians. But in this case, I do not care. This film is so effective through the subtlety of its storytelling, cinematography, performance, musical score and direction that it transcends the simplicity of the term 'history' to become 'legend.' What a marvelous film!",10,5,11,22 January 2006
Miracle," `Miracle' is an absolute crowd pleaser that you do not simply watch; you take away an experience.
","When one considers the odds that the United States Olympic Hockey team faced at the Winter Games of 1980, the end result can only be called miraculous-as is the case with the new film `Miracle.' Kurt Russell (`Dark Blue') stars as head coach Herb Brooks, chosen to lead the newfound team to glory. Even though the film is a tad conventional, it proves to be just as rousing and exciting as attending a real game. It all adds to the flavor of a great film that allows its audience to become a part of its magnanimity.	As the film opens we are introduced to Brooks' character, a no-nonsense kind of coach who has a new way of beating the famed Russian Hockey team-by learning their techniques. A simply concept, but a crucial one. Furthermore, Brooks encourages his team to get to know each other and become friends.In one scene, where old rivalries erupt between two players on the U.S. team, Brooks lets them fight it out. When they are finished, he says, `That look like hockey to you? To me it looks like two monkeys trying to hump a football.' The point being that this kind of behavior and old tensions is not going to exist on his team. He also makes it a point to say that when the team puts on their jerseys, the name on the front means more than the name on the back. In other words, these men were representing the USA and they we not going to make a spectacle of themselves over childish issues. In the end, Brooks shapes the men to be more than hockey players, but heroes during a time when the Cold War was strong. They were a symbol of the breaking of barriers between political rivalries, and the joining of athletes for the love of the game. 	The film's strongest points are in its cinematography. In several practice and game scenes, the camera gets right in the action. There are shots where ice crystals hit the lens. This gives the film the essence of realism-its not a visual effect, the ice is real and these men, although actors, are real hockey players. 	Moreover, the camera does quick zoom-ins to grab the facial expressions of its characters; much like it would if it were a real game being filmed. This gives the audience another point of realism that makes the film feel more authentic. It is that authenticity that makes so many audience members want to cheer and applaud at the screen. 	It is difficult to find fault with the acting. It is almost as realistic as it can get, except for a few minor problems-this is a Disney release and its PG rating naturally implies it being kid-friendly. In one scene, Brooks yells at a team member for not wanting to play because he a bruise on his leg. Brooks orders his player to get back on the ice and walks away from his saying he is a candy-ass. The player's response is simply to yell, `What do you want from me!' This has to toned down from anything that really happened-if a player, whom is injured and tired, is called a candy-ass by his coach, it seems only natural that a few other choice words would come out of his mouth. 	Nonetheless, `Miracle' is an absolute crowd pleaser that you do not simply watch; you take away an experience. ***1/2",9,0,0,15 February 2004
50 First Dates," `50 First Dates' is not a great movie, but with its surprising blend of a decent sincere love story and comedy, the film succeeds in entertaining us.
","One can pretty much predict how bad an Adam Sandler flick can be. His last major big-budget movie, `Anger Management,' although having Jack Nicholson, could not keep itself afloat. After all, jokes and great actors cannot outweigh a lack of reasonable plot. Nonetheless, Sandler's flicks for the most part are big money makers and his fans are always there for him. With his new movie, `50 First Dates,' Sandler brings back his brand of slapstick and pubescent humor to actually make a film that is somewhat good. In fact, `50 First Dates' has a surprising bit of sentiment to a love story that seems like it came from the Farrelly brothers. 	`50 First Dates' tells the story of Henry Roth (Sandler), a sea-park vet who meets a woman at a local restaurant whom to his chagrin has lost her short-term memory. He realizes this when after meeting her, he goes back to the restaurant and finds that she does not even remember who he is. He learns from a waitress that the girl's name is Lucy (Drew Barrymore) and that she was in an accident about a year ago in which she sustained a head injury. As such, Lucy's father, brother, and the workers at the restaurant all make Lucy think that she's living the same day over again.	Lucy's father and brother warn Henry to stay away from her feeling that his presence will only confuse her when she forgets about the day. But everyone knows that letting go of love is not an easy process. As such, Henry puts together a video in which he shows Lucy pictures of the crash and gently lets her know what has happened to her, and has happened during the previous year that she has missed. But the problem is that Henry will have to do this day in and day out-constantly reliving first dates for Lucy.	Although the premise seems fallible if not insulting to those who suffer from forms of memory loss, this film's heart is in the right place. One can tell that the characters genuinely care about each other. Sandler provides his shtick of making up songs about a pretty girl that he loves who has lost her memory. Furthermore, the video that he keeps remaking for Lucy describing the changes in her life and in the world that she does not remember is actually heartfelt. 	On to the comedy aspect-it did not start out well. A perfect example that this film was heading in the wrong direction happened in a scene where a walrus vomits all over a fellow veterinarian. As an audience member, one cannot decide whether to laugh or be disgusted. Moreover, it would not be a Sandler flick without some character getting beat up-in this case its Rob Schneider who plays Henry's pal Ula, a burned out shark catcher. 	It was nice to associate Sean Astin with something other than `Lord of the Rings.' He plays Lucy's brother Doug, who is obsessed with perfecting his body-especially with the help of steroids. Other than his gross display of peck flexing, Doug speaks with a lisp and cannot fight to save his life. His funniest scene occurs when he discusses a supposed friend's problem of having wet dreams and his fear that it could be related to steroid use. The doctor, played by Dan Akroyd, simply says, `Get off the sauce!' 	`50 First Dates' is not a great movie, but with its surprising blend of a decent sincere love story and comedy, the film succeeds in entertaining us. ***",8,0,0,22 February 2004
Catch Me If You Can," One Of The Year's Best!!!
","Catch Me If You Can [PG-13] Running Time, 2 hours: 20 minutes Starring: Leonardo Dicaprio Tom Hanks Christopher WalkenDirected by Steven Spielberg	Well Leonardo Dicaprio has returned to the big-screen these past few weeks with two great movies, by two great directors. The previous film that was released to star Dicaprio was Gangs Of New York, directed by Martin Scorsese. This week, we have a very different kind of movie from the man I like to refer to as `the great one,' called Catch Me If You Can.  `The great one,' being Steven Spielberg, my favorite director who's made some of the finest motion pictures in history. In my opinion, the release of a Steven Spielberg film is an event. He's created some of the most memorable and beautiful scenes in movie history. For example, who could forget the touching goodbye of E.T., or the horrifying invasion of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan. Catch Me If You Can is no exception to the greatness of Steven Spielberg's direction. This isn't one of his best movies, but it is one of the best films of 2002. What's more, who could resist a movie that also stars Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken. 	The story was inspired by the real events of Frank Abagnale, who as a young man eluded the authorities of millions of dollars in check fraud. Dicaprio plays Abagnale, and he certainly pulls off a stellar performance that will leave you laughing and saying, `my God, how does he get away with all this!' Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent, Carl Hanratty, who tracks Abagnale across the world. Among the identities that Abagnale assumed while forging checks was that of an airline pilot for Pan Am, a doctor, and a lawyer. It all leads to Abagnale one day working for the FBI in the check fraud division, and helps bring many criminals to justice. 	This film is really witty and will certainly leave it's audience pleased. Many people agree that the film is fun to watch, as well. It's especially great to see Leo portray the young Frank Abagnale, as Frank becomes obsessed with modeling himself after James Bond. Even going as far as to buy an Aston Martin with the money that he's received from the forged checks. This film is definitely worth seeing and is certainly one of best movies of the year. Quite possibly, in my top five picks of the year. And actually, I liked this more than Spielberg's other film released this past summer, Minority Report that starred Tom Cruise. Great work by John Williams on scoring another fine soundtrack to another great Spielberg film. Williams uses some jazzy ensembles in the score to represent the time and feeling of the film, although the main title theme of Catch Me If You Can is hardly one of a large sweeping theme. Nonetheless, there's little if anything to complain about here. The film works on all levels and I highly recommend seeing it. I was waiting to acknowledge what the best movie of the year was until I saw Catch Me If You Can. Well, I don't think that Catch Me If You Can is the best movie of the year, although one of the best films of 2002. ****",10,1,1,30 December 2002
Minority Report," What More Can One Expect From Steven Spielberg, The Master!
","This is Steven Spielberg's sci-fi take on a futuristic society where crime is predicted, before it is committed. Tom Cruise plays the chief of the Pre-Crime unit of the District Of Columbia Police Department. He himself is predicted to commit a crime before it occurs. So what does he do - he runs. He tries to escape the authorities and find out who is setting him up to commit a murder of someone who he's never even heard of. This film is filled with great suspense, and the futuristic world designed for the film is breath taking.  Good performances by Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, and Max Von Sydow help to make this one of the year's best films. Also, it discusses the issue of invading a person's rights to freedom and privacy, even in our present world where after September 11, 2001, those rights are being threatened. Minority Report is based on the short story by Phillip K. Dick. ****",10,1,2,18 January 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," `Pirates of the Caribbean,' is a fine blend of swashbuckling action, stunning visual effects, elaborate sets and fairly good performances.
","If you have ever been to Disney World, undoubtedly you have ridden one of their oldest and most famous rides, Â‘Pirates of the Caribbean.' The ride first premiered at Disneyland in California in 1956. Since then, it has astounded riders with its stunning animatronics that make riders feel as if they are actually viewing real pirates. Now, in 2003, we are blessed with a film version, equally as remarkable as the ride, but far more frightening. Unlike the usual simple live-action films based on Disney creations, hence `The Lizzy McGuire Movie,' the new `Pirates of the Caribbean,' is a fine blend of swashbuckling action, stunning visual effects, elaborate sets and fairly good performances. Starring Johnny Depp (`From Hell'), Orlando Bloom (`Black Hawk Down'), Geoffrey Rush (`Frida'), Keira Knightley (`Bend It Like Beckham'), Jack Davenport (The Talented Mr. Ripley) and Johnathan Pryce (`What A Girl Wants'), `Pirates of the Caribbean' is quite possibly one of this summer's most exciting motion pictures. 	The story follows that of Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), who after being imprisoned is freed by a blacksmith named Will Turner (Bloom). Turner needs the help of Sparrow to hunt down a band of pirates who have kidnapped the radiant Elizabeth Swann (Knightley), who is the governor's daughter. Incidentally, Swann holds a medallion that has a secret power to transform her kidnappers back into real men, as a curse has left them as ghosts. It's now a race for Sparrow and Turner to find and kill the pirates before they sacrifice Swann in an ancient ritual to free themselves from the curse. 	Depp steals the show with his constant swaggering and drunken behavior-he fits the character of Sparrow like a glove. Beyond Depp, Rush is equally engaging as the nefarious pirate Barbossa. Bloom also pulls off a realistic performance, as he does in every film in which he appears. Mostly known for his role as Legolas in `The Lord of the Rings,' films, he brings class and wit to `Pirates of the Caribbean.' All three actors share something in common-they can do no wrong. They all grace every project that they work on and add a sense of intrigue to the plot through their characterization.	The general feel of `Pirates of the Caribbean' is serious, yet campy enough to have fun along the way. The audience will certainly enjoy how Sparrow tricks British soldiers as he tries to steal a ship. But there is also a sense that the film is trying to be truthful in it's realistic portrayal, at least physically and set-wise, of what the battles would be like between naval ships. 	The set design is astonishing. A great deal of craft and creativity went into the building of ships and buildings that the pirates pillage and plunder. One feels as if they are looking at real ships from the era. Usually there are little flaws that seem to stick out on a movie screen, but with this film, they just don't seem to show up. 	The film may be a bit longer than necessary, but its thrilling from start to finish. Directed by Gore Verbinski (`The Ring'), `Pirates of the Caribbean' will long be remembered and loved for its action sequences and pure fun. However, parents should heed the PG-13 rating, as the film can be quite scary for the little ones at times. ***",8,0,2,15 July 2003
Finding Nemo," `Finding Nemo' is a treat for anyone seeking a fresh look at the computer-animated genre of family entertainment.
","Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios have brought us some great computer animated tales over the past years. Beginning with `Toy Story' in 1995, followed by `Toy Story 2,' `A Bug's Life,' `Monsters, Inc. ' and now `Finding Nemo.' `Finding Nemo' is not as original or as creative as `Monsters, Inc.,' however, the film is extremely enjoyable as it is filled with lovable characters that will charm and amuse everyone. Speaking from a computer animated standpoint, it's the greatest achievement visually that the two companies have brought us. 	`Finding Nemo' tells the story of Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clown fish that has left his coral reef home in search for his lost son, Nemo (Alexander Gould). Along his trek through the ocean, Marlin meets several humorous characters-one in particular, a fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). Dory isn't like other fish. She suffers from short-term memory loss. As such, her flaw brings about some of the film's most comical parts as she consistently forgets her name, who she's with and where she is going.On the other side of the ocean, Nemo has been captured and is living in a fish tank with several other oceanic fish in a dentist's office in Sydney, Australia. While there, he meets a fish named Gill (Willem Dafoe) who is the leader of the tank and has a plan of escaping and returning to the ocean. But there's a problem. The dentist's niece has her eye on Nemo. At the same time, word has spread by way of Nigel (Geoffrey Rush), a crane that lives on the sea and visits the fish from time to time, that Nemo's father has been traveling the ocean in search for his son. It's now up to Marlin with the help of Dory, sharks, whales and sea turtles to find Nemo in time before he is taken home with the dentist's niece. One of `Finding Nemo's' strongest points beyond its animation is its humor. Adults will find the film just as entertaining, if not more so than children. Some of the film's funniest points occur when Marlin and Dory happen upon three sharks that have vowed to stop eating fish, under a motto of `fish are friends, not food!' However, when the scent of blood from other fish is in the water, the shark's eyes turn black and they can't fight back the urge to eat fish. It leads to the sharks chasing Marlin and Dory through a sunken battle ship where depth charges are still very much active. When a torpedo is released, it touches a depth charge and a huge underwater explosion takes place. While on the surface, however, two gulls are wading when bubbles hit the surface. One of the gulls looks at the other with disgust and says, `nice.' Another strong point of `Finding Nemo' is how visually striking the image is. The film is filled with every color in the spectrum. What's more, the detail that went into the design of characters and the anemone where Marlin and Nemo live is exquisite. Never before has computer animation been so full of life and dimension as that of `Finding Nemo.' `Finding Nemo' is more than pure fun for the whole family-it's an achievement for Disney and Pixar in their pursuit to entertain at a higher level than usual brand of family entertainment. Incidentally, a great deal of which comes from Disney. It's necessary to point out the score of the film by Thomas Newman, who has composed scores for such films as `The Shawshank Redemption' and last year's wonderful `Road to Perdition.'  The music is elegant, filled with emotion and amusement that reaches beyond the usual campy scores of Randy Newman, whose done most of Disney's computer animated films. In the end, `Finding Nemo' is a treat for anyone seeking a fresh look at the computer-animated genre of family entertainment. ***",8,0,0,22 June 2003
Brokeback Mountain," Powerful!
","This is a very emotionally painful film to watch, and for many more reasons than the obvious. Certainly the story is upsetting when you see two people who are deeply in love with each other and because of circumstance it cannot be pursued, or must be kept a secret. But what about the people involved in the whole circle, and the times they live in. These two men, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhall) meet as young sheepherders in 1963. They are from the Great Plains where the notions of everyday people are not really liberal or fair-minded. They know the danger that could await them if their secret got out. Moreover, what about their families? Each character has children and a wife. How would this affect their relationships with those members? Obviously their wives would probably divorce them and maybe they would never see their children again. All these men eventually have is a seasonal trip to Brokeback Mountain where they first met. The film is not shy about the subject homosexuality or showing the intimacy of their relationship. But I never found it to be anything offensive, pornographic, amoral, etc. This movie is not a film that seeks the why of anything. It does not try to be a psychological, physiological or morality study. It is simply a tragic love story between two people who are forced to keep their affections a secret. Nothing more or less, this is the reason why the film is so painful to watch. It strikes an emotional core that we can all relate to. The performances are outstanding, especially Ledger's, as he is the protagonist of the film. But that's not to down Gyllenhall is any way. He's a fine young actor and I've been a fan of his ever since I saw 'October Sky' in 1999. What is more? The cinematography is breathtaking. Ang Lee's direction is terrific. He's a director who has quite a diverse palletfrom 'Sense & Sensibility, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' even 'Hulk' was a fine film. There have been other films that have tackled gay relationships before, but not so mainstreamed as this. And, certainly not with one of the greatest and most conservative of American imagesthe cowboy.",10,14,16,8 January 2006
Insomnia," Pacino and Williams give good performances!
","For those of you who remember this film, as it came out it May, it stars Al Pacino and Robin Williams. It's the story of a detective (Pacino) who accidentally shoots his partner and kills him while pursuing a murder suspect (Williams) in a wooded area of Alaska, where the film takes place. Two things to point out here; the sun doesn't set during the time of year where this film takes place. Also, Pacino's character can't sleep because his conscience won't allow him to forget that he killed his partner, and that he blamed it on the murder suspect played by Robin Williams. It is note worthy to point out that this film does have some good performances by Robin Williams and Hillary Swank. And how can you go wrong casting Al Pacino; he's always good.  Also, Christopher Nolan directed this film. His other claim to fame was directing the critically hailed film, Memento starring Guy Pierce. My one qualm with this film, as with other films of this year, was the fact that it was a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same title. It just seems that Hollywood doesn't have too many original ideas up it's sleeve and the really good stuff is actually coming from the other side of the world now. Unfortunately, I haven't seen the original, but if it is anything like the reviews that I have read, it's supposedly excellent. ***",7,0,0,18 January 2003
Crash," Compelling and Powerful Like No Other Film of 2005!
","Paul Haggis, the writer of the Academy Award Winning 'Million Dollar Baby,' makes his directorial debut in the year's most compelling drama, 'Crash.' Unintentionally, Haggis has created a film about race relations in Los Angeles, however, the situations could relate to almost any American city. What is unique about the many characters is that through their discrimination, be it serious or in jest, all present fallacies on the parts of others. Yet, they all speak from a perspective where the viewer, of any ethnic background, can find reasoning in their racial profiling. It is as if the film acknowledges racism, finds understanding and sympathy for it, and then manages to show how absolutely detrimental it is not only for society, but the individual person as a whole. By writing the film in such a way where the characters can be understood by the viewer, Haggis allows the audience to be intimate with those characters. We know that their assumptions are dead wrong, but we never find ourselves truly hating any of them. Take Matt Dillon, for example, who plays a racist, sexist cop. On a routine pull-over, he makes a black couple get out of their car. He frisks them both, but actually gropes the wife. In a later scene, we see this same woman, played by Thandie Newton who has gotten into a terrible accident. She is trapped in her burning car. Who should show up and save her life, but the same cop who accosted her. This is actually one of the films lighter moments of genuine intensity through emotion. But what it represents is the hypocrisy of all the characters. This was a racist cop who pulled this husband and wife over because they were black, and he groped the woman. Yet, he is here saving her life and wants nothing more than to protect her from a horrible death. Watching 'Crash,' I felt so affected by its brutal honesty and ability to unite its many characters into one giant understanding of the story as a whole. It is the most powerful film to tackle race relations since Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing.'",10,1,8,4 February 2006
Closer," And so it is...
","Mike Nichols' version of the play 'Closer' is one of 2004s most engrossing films with its sharp dialogue and astonishing performances. Everything about this film cuts to the core of the viewer. We watch as two couples, both formed by chance meetings find themselves involved in adultery and manipulation. Each character claims to love their companion, but at the same point they are willing to use them for sexual gratification and deceit. The performances by Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman are sterling. However, the best comes from Clive Owen who delivers his dialogue with such ferocity that he strikes at the audience as well. You cannot help but be taken aback by how emotionally charged and powerful Owen's acting iscertainly worth his award for Best Supporting Actor at the Golden Globes and his Oscar nomination, as well.",10,1,3,31 January 2005
Lost in Translation," We find a film with such inner meaning and depth that it moves us to understanding the characters through its own filmmaking style.
","`Lost In Translation' is a film that explores loneliness in a rather unconventional way-between a middle-aged man and a girl nearly 25 years younger. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson play the principal characters, respectively. Their performances are outstanding; as is the direction from Sofia Coppola (`The Virgin Suicides'), who also wrote the screenplay. 	`Lost In Translation' tells the story of Bob (Murray) and Charlotte (Johansson). Bob is a struggling actor who ends up in Tokyo, Japan to do a liquor commercial. Charlotte is fresh out of college, following her husband, a photographer, to Tokyo. The two meet in the hotel where they are staying, late at night in a bar. Neither can sleep and both feel a deep sense of abandonment. Bob's marriage is on the rocks and every time he calls his wife for support, she gives him the cold shoulder. Charlotte's problem rests partially with her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi), as well. John is constantly busy with work and does not spend much time with his wife. He urges Charlotte to go out into the city and enjoy herself. But she can barely speak the language and has no one to spend time with. So she stays in her hotel room looking out on a large city, filled with peoplebut with no one for her. 	When Bob and Charlotte start hanging out, they develop a close friendship. They make their greatest connection while watching TV one night. Bob explains the problems with his wife, and brings up the subject about his children. He feels that having children has completely ended his life. However, he cannot deny that they are the most beautiful things that have ever happened to him. Charlotte goes on to explain her disillusionment with life-in particular that she was a philosophy major and has not found her niche in the world yet. Bob goes on to tell her, `You'll figure that out. The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you.' It is a simple analogy, but ever so accurate.	Is there love between the two? Yes and no. Director Coppola explores their friendship and chooses not to focus on the clichés of a love story. If there is love, it is not based on a simple infatuation from good looks or sexual want. Rather, it would be based on a deep understanding of each other and the respect that accompanies it. In that respect, an emotional love does exist. 	Many of the film's crucial conversations between Bob and Charlotte are kept quiet. We are not sure specifically what the two are telling each other-it could be sexual, or it could be plans the two are making that they want to keep secret. The reason that Coppola chose to write and direct the film in this way is that she does not want the audience to focus on the love aspect of the characters. Rather, the film wants us to focus on the unique friendship between these very different, but very much alike people. 	Also, the film has a great deal of music, but not a score as most films utilize. Without musical score, a film can lack feeling and depth. That is exactly what Coppola wanted here. Without music, the audience feels isolated from emotion as the characters do in the film. Therefore, the audience can relate more to them. 	In the end, we find a film with such inner meaning and depth that it moves us to understanding the characters through its own filmmaking style. ****",10,0,0,22 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The second best STAR WARS film to date!!!
","What a crowd pleaser!!! George Lucas has returned STAR WARS to what it always should have been; inventive, and adventurous. This film far exceeds EPISODE I on many levels. The writing, and dialogue are far better - personally that was my biggest concern with PHANTOM... Also, there is less Jar Jar Binks, so audiences will be less anoyed by the childish antics of that very disliked Gungan. But the best part of EPII was clearly Yoda. Yoda has the largest role his character has ever had in a STAR WARS film, and although he has become a CGI character from a puppet, the people at ILM did a marvelous job in crafting him. The scene where Yoda has his own lightsaber battle with Count Dooku is pretty impressive, as well. For IMDB, I'd rate this film at 10 stars. If it were the normal film rating system, however, I would give it 4 stars; both equalling excellence. On another note, I did love PHANTOM MENACE. But I do think that Lucas sacrificed the integrity of plot, and dialgue for the visual aspects. Nontheless, I loved both films of the new STAR WARS Trilogy.",10,0,1,5 June 2002
The Aviator," Martin Scorsese's take on a 20 year period in Howard Hughes' life can only be called spectacular.
","Martin Scorsese's take on a 20 year period in Howard Hughes' life can only be called spectacular. This film has had me raving since the first time I saw it several weeks back. It is an epic that has everything that makes an epic film extraordinary with its story of a person who are bigger than life itself, combined with great visual effects, wonderfully colorful performances, and exposing the utter genius of Hughes, 'The Aviator' proves not only be entertaining, but enlightening. Opening with the shot of Hughes as a boy being bathed by his mother and her spelling the word 'quarantine' to him, she instills a fear of disease on what was a fragile mind. We watch how Hughes subtly becomes obsessed with his business ventures into TWA airlines, his scandalous movies, and his building of the world's largest airplane, the Hercules. Furthermore, we see an intimate look at the man from escapades with teenage girls to Hollywood actresses Eva Gardener and Katharine Hepburn, played by Kate Beckinsale and Cate Blanchette, respectively. Blanchette's performance as Hepburn is so colorful and amusing that she proves to be the film's most intriguing performance. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes in an excellent performance. The only thing that works against DiCaprio is that he physically looks young, a look he's had trouble shedding considering he is in his early 30s. But it is easy to disregard considering his dialogue delivery and movements are superb. The film flows at a furious rate for a three hour picture and it manages to hold the audience's attention the whole period without succumbing to a single dull moment. Simply put, 'The Aviator' is the best film of 2004!",10,5,8,31 January 2005
The Bourne Identity," Good, Intelligent Thriller!
","When I think of spy films, generally what comes to mind are the James Bond films, the Misson: Impossible films, the Jack Ryan series, or perhaps even James Cameron's take on the spy film genre, True Lies. The Bourne Identity, however, is more like the Jack Ryan series in that it is a serious film. Starring Matt Damon (Dogma), and Chris Cooper (American Beauty), The Bourne Identity is a nice break from the more Â‘over-done' series of spy films. The story centers around a man who has amnesia, and with the help of a young woman, he tries to discover the secret of his own identity. But the truth is difficult to face when he realizes that he is an assassin for the American government.  Filled with great action sequences and some cool car chases, The Bourne Identity proves to be a thriller that not only provides excitement and intrigue, but brains, as well. ***",8,0,1,22 January 2003
The Italian Job," `The Italian Job' is a movie that won't disappoint, but won't leave you amazed, either.
","Everyone loves a good heist flick. But it's hard today to make an original one-probably the reason why some modern heist flicks have been remakes such as `The Thomas Crown Affair' and `Ocean's Eleven.' Now, we have the remake of the 1969 film, `The Italian Job.' It's easy to conclude that the main reason Hollywood remakes older films is because they are just trying to cash in on a dead movie. However, if they can do it as good as the original or better, than perhaps that does warrant remaking a motion picture. `The Italian Job,' from director F. Gary Gray (`A Man Apart') was a good film, but its one problem may rest in the fact that heist flicks are becoming less intriguing and more of cliché. 	`The Italian Job' is the story of a group of thieves who while trying to steal gold in Venice are betrayed by one of their members, Steve (Edward Nortin), who kills their boss, John (Donald Sutherland), and takes the gold from the group of thieves. After a period of time, the friends regroup under the leadership of one of the members who felt that John was like a father to him, Charlie (Mark Wahlberg). Under new guidance, they try to steal back the gold from Steve. But they can't do it alone-they need the help of John's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron). The film moves towards a revenge scenario, as the group not only tries to get the gold back, but also avenge the death of John. 	`The Italian Job' has its moments that require a person to suspend disbelief. For example, in the scene where Steve betrays the others, their van crashes off of a bridge and they fall into a frozen mountain lake, as Steve peppers the icy water with bullets. It's amusing that, with the exception of John, all the men survive the frozen water. After they come out of the water, they even have time to grieve a bit over the death of John, regardless of the cold temperatures and that they are still wearing their soaking wet clothes. 	The film was well made, though. Director Gray did a good job with making some suspenseful moments during a chase scene between a helicopter and three Mini cars. The movie also has its humorous moments, the best of which involve Seth Green who plays Lyle. According to Lyle, he invented the Napster music-sharing phenomenon while his roommate in college, Shawn Fanning, stole the disc with the program on it while Lyle was sleeping. Hence the reason while Lyle refers to himself as the original Napster.	 Although `The Italian Job' was a good movie that was fun at times, it just didn't feel all that enthralling. The reason rests in the notions that heist films, or confidence scheme movies are becoming more of a cliché where we can predict everything before it happens. Also, the trailers for this film just ruined any surprises that the audience could take away from the film. It would be wiser to download the two and a half-minute trailer online than to pay full theatrical prices to sit through the two-hour movie. However, if you have the time and ambition to do so, `The Italian Job' is a movie that won't disappoint, but won't leave you amazed either. ***",Null,0,3,7 June 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," A good ending to a hyper-cool trilogy.
","It's been four years since we first saw `The Matrix,' and few could have predicted the immense success that it would become. Two sequels later, we finally see how it all ends in `The Matrix Revolutions.' One thing to be expected with this film is it is action-oriented. For those out there who love the semi-deep philosophy involved, never fear, it is still here-just downplayed. We basically know everything, after `The Matrix Reloaded.' We know that Neo is the one.' We know that instead of ending the war, he chose to save Trinity's life and fight another day. But exactly HOW was it going to end? You'll have to find out for yourself. 	`The Matrix Revolutions' picks up exactly where `Reloaded' left off-Neo appears to be a coma. In fact, he is trapped in a place between the real world and the computer world and he is being held there by the Merovingian. Morpheus and Trinity take it upon themselves to make a deal with the Merovingian to set him free. 	When freed, Neo visits the Oracle one last time. However, her appearance has changed in order to hide her identity-after all, she is a program and can be changed (Gloria Foster who played the original Oracle died before `Reloaded' was completed. Mary Alice plays the new oracle). She reminds Neo that he still has to face Agent Smith one last time in order to completely end the war. As such, they are now off and trying to find a way to help the underground city of Zion fight off the machine army burrowing towards them.When a strategy is formulated, Neo and Trinity decide to take a ship, alone. Neo knows that in order to end things once and for all, he'll have to go Machine City, where humans are grown, and face the leader of the machines. He believes this confrontation will be the key to ending the war between humans and machines. The philosophy that once seemed so deep is still in `Revolutions,' just in a minor way, compared to the last films. The Oracle reminds Neo that in order to defeat Agent Smith, Neo has to understand that he and Smith are practically the same person-they just have different personalities. Only when Neo can comprehend Smith's intentions, can he ever hope to beat him. Metaphorically, Smith is compared to Neo's evil twin. Also, I found it amusing how in the one scene where we see the elusive Architect of the matrix, he explains to the Oracle the outcome of world if the matrix comes to an end. When the Oracle questions the Architect if what he's saying is true, his response is, `What do you think I am, human?' Naturally, in his world, machines do not know how to lie. `The Matrix Revolutions' is an action flick-and what a great one at that! The visual effects are as astonishing as one would expect from the series. However, unlike `Reloaded,' `Revolutions' sequences do not drag on for long periods of time. In `Reloaded,' many of the scenes seemed be never-ending as if to show-off the filmmaker's great visual technique of Bullet-time. In actuality, it was overkill for the film making it run longer than necessary. In `Revolutions,' we get the right amount of action combined with those amazing Bullet-time shots. As such, it's every bit as impressive now as it was in the first two films. Overall, `The Matrix Revolutions' is a good ending to a hyper-cool trilogy. ***",8,2,4,12 November 2003
Radio," Gooding and Harris manage to pull off noteworthy performances.
","The new film `Radio,' although saturated with sentimentality and clichés, is a heartwarming winner of a movie! I fell in love with it for so many reasons. One, I actually liked its conventionality, perhaps because I was seeking something light, yet mildly meaningful. Two, the film had a beautiful score by composer James Horner. Lastly, great performances from Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris. 	`Radio' was inspired by the true story of James Kennedy, a mentally challenged, African-American man from Hannah, South Carolina. In the film, James (Gooding) pushes a cart with a radio and a few other possessions around the town. When he passes the high-school football field, he is noticed by Coach Jones (Harris). Jones is curious about the young man as he constantly stares at the football players as if he wanted to be one.One day, Jones offers James the opportunity of helping out the team with various activities. Also, Jones notices that James' one true passion seems to be for a radio in Jones' office. Jones lets James take it and the young man soon becomes known as Radio.' Although unappreciated at first for causing a few fumbles at games and yelling out plays, he becomes an inspiration for many in the community. He teaches them to see the person inside, rather than the flaws on the outside. There are so many standard ideas in `Radio' that it would not be surprising if many elitist critics completely shun it. To them, I say get off your high horse! You have to loose yourself with a film like this and appreciate it for what it is. Harris plays Jones in a traditional format-he's the coach who has forgotten he has got a family. The film takes place in a small town where the local yokels' meet at a barbershop to discuss the win or loss. What is more? Everyone eats Burger Kingall the time it would seem. My point is that simplicity can be the best course of action for a movie.  It was not necessary to go over the top with `Radio' and try to cover new ground. It is lovable for what it is. The score composed by Horner is wonderful. Along with the resonant voice of India Arie, the music adds an emotional kick to the film that few other film composers can grasp like Horner. Point in fact, if a director wants to drive his audience to tears with music that pulls at their heartstrings, then hire Horner. His work on such films as `Glory,' `Apollo 13,' and `Titanic' are equally engaging. Gooding and Harris manage to pull off noteworthy performances. Gooding provides a whimsical, yet heartfelt projection of the real Radio. Harris's performance is an expectation that you can always count on as excellent. We admire his portrayal of Jones and his love for Radio. Radio and Jones become the equivalent of a father/son dynamic. As such, you find yourself loving both of these characters for their willingness to help each other learn something greater about themselves. The most important aspect to take away from `Radio' is that showing a little bit of love and attention goes a long way. Jones says at one point, `Radio treats us all the time, the way we wish we treated each other half of the time.' I admire that notion. I admire because it is a part of the fabric of every human to offer care and respect, although it does not always happen. Either way, the simplicity of that notion, as well as the genius of it can not be denied. ***",Null,0,0,12 November 2003
The Village," Superb Motion Picture!
","Rather than dwell on the plot, or possibly make a revelation in this review that would ruin your experience in being shocked or drawn in by this film, I choose to write this review solely on the message and concepts addressed in `The Village' alone. If you want a plot summary, you can read them online, or go the website listed above.M. Night Shyamalan's `The Village' is certainly one of the most impressive films to be released this summer. The story, however, is not what you will expect-perhaps the only thing ever to expect from Shyamalan's films. But moreover, the movie ends on a note that is not acceptable to the average filmgoer: one of the reasons why so many people are not enjoying the movie. But why should an unconventional ending deter a moviegoer's experience or enjoyment? After all, movies that have come from the greatest filmmakers ever have been unconventional. Imagine a film by Stanley Kubrick ending on a happy note, with a swelling score and every actor on the screen walking away into the sunset with smiles on their faces. It just does not fit Kubrick's style, as is the case with Shyamalan. With four major features under his belt, Shyamalan seems to be developing a pattern. With `The Sixth Sense,' we end on a note of truth and acceptance for that truth. It is a hopeful ending. With `Unbreakable,' we end with truth, but the world that we inhabit remains dark and sinister. `Signs,' like `The Sixth Sense' ends on a note of hope for the future and resolution with the past. Now, we have `The Village,' which ends on a note of darkness. There is resolution, but the characters remain static-many knowing that there is a truth beyond the borders of their village, but choosing not to be a part of it. Furthermore, keeping it a secret from those who trust them. There are three major messages that I took away from this movie relating to fear, escapism and good intentions. First, the concept of fear-just like F.D.R. said, `we have nothing to fear but fear itself.' Shyamalan has used this concept in all of his movies, in one form or another. In `The Village,' fear is used to keep the people in-line with the rules and ways set forth by the village elders. That fear, it is believed by the elders, will protect the village people from not only the others that they fear beyond their woods, but from themselves. Moreover, by developing a credible fear in the populace, those who govern are able to control their people into believing in their goals and aspirations by making them afraid of a threat that is actually not as great as they make it out to be. This message was also made present in another summer blockbuster, `Fahrenheit 9/11.'	 The second message that Shyamalan addresses is that of escapism in the wake of some great grief. This is a common belief in society, as well as historically. It is documented that after the death of his wife and mother, Theodore Roosevelt took to the American west in search of relief from sadness.  People believe that somehow they can escape some great emotional pain by filling the void with an adventure or new way of living. Rarely, if ever, is this the case. Grief and despair at some point or another will find a person, regardless of where and how they live their lives.	Lastly, the concept that good intentions are not enough is addressed. Good intentions have been used throughout history to rally people against a supposed evil or danger. A perfect example is that of the Vietnam War, or the Great Leap Forward in China. Reasons for intentions have to be analyzed and thought out well with the consequences weighed. If not, all the good intentions of the greatest individuals in the world could bring about their own and many other's downfall. 	In terms of filmmaking alone, `The Village' is great. The performances are excellent. The score from James Newton Howard with violin solos by Hilary Hahn are eloquent. And it would not be a Shyamalan film without seeing the director in at least one scene, which has an excellent use of mise-en-scene. ***1/2",9,0,0,5 August 2004
Cold Mountain," Many great filmmaking qualities, but the melodrama of it's love story is annoying!
","`Cold Mountain' is one of those tragic love stories that director Anthony Minghella loves, like his Oscar winning film, `The English Patient.' However, unlike `The English Patient,' one does not feel swept away in the grandeur of the love story. `Cold Mountain' plays out like an overemotional romance novel turned film. Still, I cannot deny that the film has many great filmmaking qualities that to down it would be unfair. This movie is marvelous for its cinematography, direction, performances, and musical score. The film is based on the book by Charles Frazier. 	`Cold Mountain' opens with a stunning battle scene during the Civil War in which one of the characters, Inman (Jude Law) is wounded. While in hospital, he is read a letter from his lover, Ada (Nicole Kidman), back home in Cold Moutain by a nurse. Ada's final comment was `come back to me,' so he deserts the Confederate Army and begins his trek home. On the way, he is troubled by the memories he has of Ada, as they have only met on a few occasions but have become infatuated with each other. The same is true for Ada-she is so consumed with grief that she spends more time writing him letters and pining over him than she does taking care of her farm. On the way home, Inman meets many colorful characters that give him aid, or slow him down. One of which was Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman) whose piety and bad habits do not mix. As for Ada, a young woman named Ruby (Renee Zellweger) approaches her. Ruby has a cocky attitude and hardy nature that bring about some of the film's more whimsical moments. She wants nothing more from Ada than a home and food. The two agree and get the farm back in order. But there are problems in Cold Mountain-the sheriff is on a mission to kill anyone who may harbor deserters of the Confederacy. Ada, Ruby, and Inman will have to face the righteousness of the law before all is said and done. I was not impressed by Reverend Veasey's character, regardless of Hoffman's excellent performance. He added distaste to the film when at that point it was based on noble characters. However, Inman also met two other women during his travels. One of them was named Sara (Natalie Portman), a woman whose husband had died and she was now alone to fend for herself and her newborn son. Portman portrays her grief so effectively that it pulls at the audience's heart. Especially during a scene when she asks Inman to sleep in her bed with her so she will not be alone. Nothing sexual occurs, but it was a nice touch to give this woman something to feel after she had been alone for so long. Another interesting character that Inman meets is an elderly woman named Maddy (Eileen Atkins) who looks after him-she lives in the woods, in a shack and raises goats. She provides Inman with medicine and food for his journey. What's more, she also provides understanding of Inman's heartache for his beloved. `Cold Mountain's' one weakness is its melodrama-it becomes irritating at times and one cannot help but want it to end. In one scene, Ada and Inman confess their love and want to get married by saying `I'll marry you' three times, as they do in some strange land unknown to them. Give me a break! It is a good thing that the film can fall back on so much filmmaking majesty as opposed to its overbearing love story. ***1/2",9,1,1,28 December 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," `T3' is a relatively good action/science-fiction sequel that holds true to the original concepts that Cameron created.
","Twelve years ago, James Cameron released one of the most successful and visually stunning action/science fiction releases of all time-`Terminator 2: Judgment Day.' Now we have a sequel called `Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines.' It would seem like another Hollywood action extravaganza without a plot. After all, the characters in `T2' stopped Judgment Day from ever happening, so what's left? Apparently, they only postponed it. So it's once again up to the future resistance of humankind to send back a protector for John Connor and his future wife, Kate Brewster. Although the story line sounds contrived, the filmmakers came up with some good plot concepts in order to continue the series on a level of minor intelligence. The end result is less dark and less hard-core action than James Cameron's direction gave in the first two films. Nonetheless, `T3' is a worthy sequel that has some great action sequences and keeps the story believable. 	`T3' begins in the present day with images of John (Nick Stahl) who lives off the grid in order to keep his existence a secret. At the same time, the machine army of the future sends back a new kind of terminator, the T-X (Kristanna Loken), a female whose mission is to destroy not only John, but also his future lieutenants. As such, the human resistance sends back their own terminator, the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the model designed to protect John and his future spouse, Kate (Claire Danes). Here's the catch. Kate's father, Robert Brewster (David Andrews) is the man who heads up the computer network Skynet. But what he doesn't realize is that Skynet, a form of artificial intelligence, is becoming self-aware. In other words, as soon as Skynet is brought online, it will take over computer networks and mainframes worldwide, and the war will begin. It's now a race to stop not only the T-X from destroying the crucial members of the future human resistance, but also a race to stop Skynet from coming online.	`T3' had some great action sequences. In particular, a chase scene in which the T-X tries to run down John and Kate with a huge crane truck, as the T-800 hangs on by the crane. The T-X crashes the truck into the sides of buildings and other vehicles in order to stop the terminator from saving John and Kate. As absurd as the scene is, it leads to an incredible crash that will leave one's jaw on the floor of the theater in awe.	Jonathan Mostow took over the direction of `The Terminator' series, as it was the brainchild of `Titanic' director James Cameron. Mostow's credits include the heart-pounding suspense thriller `Breakdown,' and the World War II submarine flick `U-571.' Mostow's direction is not as hard edged as Cameron's was, but it is certainly respectable. Usually, as the founding filmmaker of a project leaves, the new director may ruin the legacy left by the original filmmaker-a problem that existed with `Jurassic Park III.' Steven Spielberg portrayed an image filled with suspense and intrigue into the dinosaur world created by author Micheal Crichton. However, when Joe Johnston (`October Sky') took over as the director, he created a simple, campy film that couldn't even compare to the greatness of its predecessors.	It's great to see Schwarzenegger back in action, as well. He was made to be the hero in these kinds of films. And `T3' is a far cry better than his last flick, `Collateral Damage.' In the end, `T3' is a relatively good action/science-fiction sequel that holds true to the original concepts that Cameron created. ***",8,0,0,6 July 2003

Spirited Away," A story of incredible imagination that is filled with amusing and intriguing characters.
","Hayao Miyazaki, the writer/director of 1999s hit anime, `Princess Mononoke,' now brings us `Spirited Away,' the Academy Award winner for Best Animated Feature 2002. `Spirited Away' presents an interesting blend of traditional Japanese anime and computer animation with a fantastic story that is well drawn out. When broken down, the film resembles traditional mythology that has been handed down from generations and adds colorful characters full of wit and charm. The end result is a dazzling animated feature that not only entertains, but also gives the same morals that all classic fairy tales do.	The story follows that of Chihiro, a young girl who is traveling with her parents to their new home, when they stumble across an abandoned theme park. When inside, her parents are transformed into pigs after eating freshly prepared foods set out in the park. Little do they know that they have entered a realm in which the unimaginable is possible. With the help of magical friends that she makes along the way, Chihiro has to find a way to transform her parents back into human form and ultimately save herself and her new friends from the clutches of vile Yubaba, a witch that Chihiro is forced to work for in the realm of the spirits. 	`Spirited Away' is filled with imagination that is reflected through its lively characters. Haku, a boy that aids Chihiro against the Yubaba, is able to transform himself into a dragon. Kamaji, a boiler room supervisor, has several arms that enable him to do several jobs at once. And Yubaba, a witch who is the boss of a bathhouse where spirits work, is a withered old lady whom although human in appearance, is much larger than any ordinary human.	The most notable part of `Spirited Away' was the relationship that it has with other classic fairy tales-most notably, the stories of `Pinocchio,' and `Alice In Wonderland.' First off, Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs while eating food in a disgusting manor. As was the case in `Pinocchio' in which runaway boys have their fill of fun at a secret amusement park called Pleasure Island, where after words, the boys become donkeys. The idea being that if you are going to act like an ass, you become it. As reflected in `Spirited Away,' if you're going to act like a pig, you become it. Secondly, the film is similar to the story of `Alice In Wonderland,' in that a little girl finds herself in an unusual world filled with strange creatures, and all she wants to do is find a way home.	With its relationships to classic myths and fairy tales of yesteryear, `Spirited Away' is just as ground breaking as the original `Star Wars,' `The Lord Of the Rings,' and even `The Matrix,' in that all four of these films are representations of classic mythology and the fight of good conquering evil. The only difference between these films is the setting and characters, which is the reason that these stories can be made over and over again in film; there is an inherent fascination in people to discover new stories of heroes and villains. 	In the end, `Spirited Away' proves to be a story of incredible imagination that is filled with amusing and intriguing characters. ***",8,0,1,22 May 2003
Before Sunset," A willingness to drop everything in their world for each other.
","Richard Linklater returns the characters of Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) in this sequel to 1995s 'Before Sunrise.' This time finds the two meeting in Paris during Jesse's book tour and their desire for each other is still ever present. In under an hour and a half, shot in real time, the two discuss the past nine years of their lives from the loss of Celine's grandmother, a profound influence in her life, to Jesse's marital problems. More importantly, the question of what would have been if they had had the chance to stay together beyond their one night of passion nine years before. It is a question they examine throughout the film and a desire for one another that cannot be denied. But the film does not get lost in sexuality. Rather, it focuses on their unique relationship: the moments they share from her singing, to his writing. There are profound truths in this film brought about by their discussions, some of which are practically existential and the questions that most naïve youths have. But that is the beauty of their relationshipthe naiveté they bring about. That willingness to drop everything in their world for each other.",Null,0,0,31 January 2005
The Pianist," Polanski has poured his heart and soul into this picture!
","Acclaimed director Roman Polanski (`Rosemary's Baby,' `Chinatown') brings us one of the most stirring Holocaust pictures ever seen, `The Pianist,' based on the book by Wladyslaw Szpilman, who is a Jew that survived a Nazi ghetto in Warsaw, Poland. Szpilman is the central character of the film, portrayed by actor Adrian Brody (`Summer Of Sam') who provides such greatness in his performance that it's hard to find a better actor in any film of 2002. Undoubtedly, part of `The Pianist's' magnificence can be attributed to the real life conditions that Polanski faced while growing up. He himself lived in a Nazi ghetto as a child, until he escaped. Both of his parents spent time in concentrations camps, where his mother eventually died. However, Polanski was reacquainted with his father in 1945. 	While watching the film, I couldn't help but feel absolute humility for the real-life characters. Even though most people are aware of the revolting things that Nazis did to Jewish prisoners, it's still quite heart wrenching to watch. For example, from the simple embarrassment that Jews endured in the ghetto of having to dance in the streets for the Nazi soldiers to another scene that depicted Nazis throwing an elderly man out of his wheelchair from an apartment building into the street, only to run over his body later. 	One scene in particular that showed the devastation of the war was one in which Szpilman walks down a deserted city street in the later part of the film. The landscape sent chills down my spine as the street stretched for miles and there was nothing but charred remains of buildings blown out by the onslaught of the war. All that could be heard was artillery fire in the far distance. On this street is where Szpilman spent the last weeks of the Nazi occupation, living in the attic of war-torn house.	`The Pianist' is being nominated for Best Picture, although I don't feel it was the best film of 2002; my pick for Best Picture is `The Hours.' However, this film is absolutely remarkable. Polanski has poured his heart and soul into this picture, and he certainly deserves an Oscar for Best Director. But it's unlikely he will get it due to the fact that he fled the U.S. in the late 70s for Europe after his conviction for statutory rape. Among other Oscar nods that `The Pianist' has going for it are Best Actor (Brody), Best Cinematography (Pawel Edelman), and Best Screenplay (Ronald Harwood, Wladyslaw Szpilman). ****",10,0,1,17 March 2003
Seabiscuit," `Seabiscuit' is a modern classic that certainly will not be forgotten.
","Every summer, there is one movie that captivates audiences and critics alike. Last year, it was `Road To Perdition.' This year, it's the adaptation of the beloved book `Seabiscuit.' `Seabiscuit' is more than just a film. It proves that big-budget cinema can still release motion pictures with absolute integrity. Like the marvelous independent film `Whale Rider,' `Seabiscuit' is about broken people. These people somehow find a way to pick themselves up and start over with something new to give them meaning in life. Although this idea of a feel good movie is not new, most people can't get enough of them-they are inspiring. In `Seabiscuit,' we are not only moved by the delicacy of beautiful filmmaking, but also by wonder of its story.	 The film centers around three lost men. The first is that of Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire), who has spent most of life in the hands of jockeys that treated him as inferior. This turns him hardy and pushes people away from anything that could be meaningful. The second man is Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), the developer of Buick automobiles who looses his only son during a car accident. Afterwards, his wife, distraught with grief, leaves Howard to escape the memories of her son and the lifestyle that Howard's fortune has created. The third character is that of Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), a cowboy, with an affinity for horses, whose world is quickly changing. The three men meet together at various points and form a friendship when Howard purchases a racehorse in desperate need of training named Seabiscuit. Ironically enough, Pollard who has been abused and rundown equally as much as Seabiscuit is chosen to be the jockey. Smith said it best-`you don't throw a whole life away simply because it's banged up a little.' But it will take more than hard work to break the horse. Through their trials and pain, the men find the strength to pick themselves up and find something to believe in when their original dreams were shattered. 	Beyond the aspects of great filmmaking, the film reaches its audience in extraordinary ways. You find yourself routing for Seabiscuit during onscreen races as if you were actually at the track watching a real race. In fact, you feel the urge to applaud when Pollard and Seabiscuit win.It goes farther than betting on the horse-the real Seabiscuit and Pollard were an inspiration to the working class during the depression era that they came from. They reminded people that hope survives in the depths of any kind of depression, be it personal or economic. 	Director Gary Ross (`Pleasantville') has done a superb job in translating the book into a screen story. There are several parts of the film where the cinematography is absolutely lush from the fall foliage at Saratoga to the Palm Trees of the South. Some of the shots in the film were so well done that they were a reminder of `Ben-Hur' and the astounding chariot race that director William Wyler brought to life in 1959. Slow motion shots of the horses racing show utter grace and beauty for the majesty of these animals.	Performances in the film range from good to excellent. After all, `Seabiscuit' stars Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges, and Chris Cooper-need I say more! 	Even people who don't really enjoy this film will be hard pressed to find anything truly negative to say about it. Point in fact; `Seabiscuit' is a modern classic that certainly will not be forgotten. ***1/2",8,0,0,4 August 2003
28 Days Later...," `28 Days Later' gains its strength from its remarkable human approach in the wake of such horrific events.
","Let's face some facts about the today's horror genre-it sucks! With moronic plot sequences accompanied by the worst bred actors, the level of expectation with such films is low. However, Danny Boyle (`Trainspotting') has brought moviegoers something new, yet almost traditional in the sense of horror films; a zombie thriller called `28 Days Later.' By using good actors, an amateur format for the cinematography and a decent story, Boyle gives us something that is not only horrific, but also terrifying in the very notions of its story. `28 Days Later' tells the story of a man named Jim (Cillian Murphy) who wakes up in a hospital one morning, only to find that the world he knows has turned upside down. What's more, there appears to be no one around. Jim soon realizes that the human race has been taken over by a plague that turns people into zombies. He then finds some survivors; one named Selena (Naomie Harris) who tells of the events that have transpired. In particular, how the virus is spread, through blood and other human secretions. As they search the city, they find an apartment building with holiday lights in the windows. They enter the building and find a few more survivors, a man named Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). While there, they hear a recording on a hand radio that tells any survivors to come to Manchester for help and 'the answer to infection.' But when they arrive in Manchester, they find more than they can handle. It's easy to admire Boyle for his great direction on this picture. The amateur film format is really the best trick up this director's sleeve. Because the print of film has a videotape appearance, it makes the movie appear raw and rough to watch. The camera, during suspense shots, is always shaking which gives the audience an almost dizzying feel to watching the movie. With the dizzying feel of the film, it also makes the story seem more real. That's where the real horror sets in-how incredibly real the film appears. Regardless of the notions of zombies, the idea of a plague, which in this case was manmade, administered to monkeys that got out of hand and harmed their trainers turning them into zombies appears in a realistic way. The very opening of the film centers around a break-in to an animal facility that houses these mad-apes and a botched attempt to destroy them. After that, for a few minutes we see news footage of rioting and complete social unrest in the wake of the plague as it hits the whole of England; something that could certainly happen when a society is faced with an unstoppable force. The acting in the film was very good. Murphy and Harris are great in their roles as survivors looking for an answer to the infection. But real credit has to be given to Gleeson for his role as Frank, a father trying to save his young daughter from the dangers that exist in their world now. We feel his pain as he tries to make his daughter feel like things are going to be all right. He does this by stringing up Christmas lights in their apartment window and binge shopping in a grocery store. In the end, `28 Days Later' gains its strength from its remarkable human approach in the wake of such horrific events, however, absurd as they may be. It's a great change in pace for lovers of horror films, not consumed by the commercialism that ruins most entertainment these days. ***",8,0,0,20 July 2003
Hellboy," A unique hero rises to the challenge!!!
","Many think that comic-book hero adapted films have become a dime-a-dozen what with `Spider-Man,' `The Hulk,' and `Daredevil.' However, it is not like these movies have been all that bad-the best being `The Hulk' which portrayed a tormented man born with abilities that he cannot control. Now we have `Hellboy.' Hellboy himself is hardly a super-human; he is more of a super Satan. With a unique look of red skin, broken horns, and a right hand made of armor, we find a friendly and heroic character willing to save the world from the clutches of his own kind-ultimate evil. The end result is a familiar, yet exceptional tale of good verses evil. 	`Hellboy' tells the story of the son of Satan, taken from hell by a ritual in which Nazis tried to take over the world. The good-old boys of the American army botched the attempt and the creature taken from hell was adopted by the United States government and appropriately named Hellboy (Ron Perlman). Raised by Professor Bruttenholm (John Hurt), a scientist who works for a secret U.S. Government agency, Hellboy learns the ways of good and fights to protect the world from `things that go bump in the night.'	Now, in the present, Hellboy is faced with the resurrected Grigori Rasputin and Nazis, as they attempt to once again take over the world by bringing hell down on earth. Hellboy is aided in his fight by another strange creature named Abraham 'Abe' Sapien (Doug Jones), a fish-like man with great knowledge; Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), a beautiful young woman who can manipulate fire; and a new recruit to the agency named John Myers, a future replacement for the ailing Professor Bruttenholm. Their adventure to save the world will force Hellboy to face his very identity and require him to make a choice between the world of which he physically is, and the world that he was brought up to fight for. 	Although the film is conventional and we can expect to see an unusual hero rise, we also find a one-of-a-kind hero that will not back down from what he knows to be right. The unconventional aspect of `Hellboy' rests in its awesome characters that are not only colorful, but also personified by their human qualities. For example, Hellboy himself is deeply in love with Liz Sherman and would do anything to protect her. There is a funny scene in which Liz enters Hellboy's room and finds him writing one love letter after another to her. As for the character of Abraham Sapien, he offers words of wisdom for Liz when Hellboy is distraught over his ailing adopted father, Professor Bruttenholm. Sapien says, `If there's trouble, then all of us freaks has is each other.' 	Identity and choice are the keys to these super-hero flicks. Hellboy has to make a choice between fighting for good or evil. Choice is imperative and it is what separates these characters from other people around them. The same is true for the characters of `Spider-Man,' and `The Hulk.' They acknowledge that they are cursed soles-but they do not have to live a cursed life. They are both normal and abnormal. It is their choice to live in a world where they can protect mankind so that people will not have to feel the same pain that they do. As for `Hellboy,' it latches on to that quality, will not let go and becomes a movie where an unlikely creature becomes a hero. ***",8,0,0,4 April 2004
Good Will Hunting," One of 1997's Best Films!
","Matt Damon proves himself as one of the best actors in Hollywood. What's more, he co-wrote the script with Ben Affleck. This film is probably the best that one will ever see Affleck in-he's highly over-rated. Nonetheless, a strong story, good acting, and excellent direction from Gus Van Sant make `Good Will Hunting' one of the best films of 1997. I have to give credit to Robin Williams for his powerful performance as Will's mentor, Sean. Danny Elfman provides a poignant score, as well. ***1/2",9,2,6,28 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Epic sequel lives up to 'The Fellowship...'
","Well here we are, one year after THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. I know that many of you out there are all very excited about this release, as you all should be. After all, if THE TWO TOWERS is anything like THE FELLOWSHIP. then it will undoubtedly be good. This is the obvious case. That's what happens when you have a director, Peter Jackson, who is more than just an avid fan of J.R.R Tolkien's fantasy trilogy. Jackson has created two motion pictures that are epic beyond proportion to anything that we have ever seen before theatrically. They are visually stunning, filled with incredible action sequences, and a story that reaches into the very foundations of all of our imaginations. When THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING opened last year on December 19, it was a huge success with an opening box-office weekend upwards of $45 million. What's more, it didn't really fall out of the public's attention after the Christmas holiday; rather it held on. With talk of Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations, strong word of mouth from film patrons, critical appeal, and a huge fan base that was already established from the amazing series of books, THE FELLOWSHIP. proved to be a huge success in every aspect. Now, after one year of waiting we have THE TWO TOWERS. George Lucas, creator of the STAR WARS Trilogy and INDIANA JONES said it best during an interview about the original STAR WARS Trilogy. George said that every play has three acts. In the first act, there is a small victory. The second act puts the main characters in the worst possible situation. And in the third act, the hero saves the day, and all's well that end's well. That's the case with THE LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy. THE FELLOWSHIP. set the stage with a small victory at the end of the film, but establishing the idea of hope and that there is more to come in the story. THE TWO TOWERS pits its characters in the worst possible situation. Naturally, we can expect some fantastic ending to come next year in THE RETURN OF THE KING. As for THE TWO TOWERS, Frodo and Sam are off in the land of Mordor, trying to get to the gates of Mordor to destroy `the one ring.' However, they notice that they are being followed, and who should it be but Gollum, the deformed creature that originally had the ring before it came into the possession of Bilbo. Frodo and Sam capture Gollum and make him lead them to the gates of Mordor. Meanwhile Aragorn, Gimly the dwarf, and Legolas the elf are off to find the two hobbits who were kidnapped during the final battle of THE FELLOWSHIP., Merry and Pippin. But the lands of Middle Earth are in more peril than ever, and Saruman The White is sending his army of Uruk-hai against the lands of Middle Earth. In this case, it is primarily the land of Rohan. It is up to the three companions of the original fellowship to unit with the people of Rohan, and with the help of Gandalf The White, formally The Grey. They lead the people of Rohan into an immense battle in a place called Helm's Deep.Obviously the plot is far more intricate than that, however, fantasy, at least for me, is a bit difficult to explain. And I'm sure that those of you who haven't seen THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING are probably confused by the plot explanation in the above paragraph. If you are, then watch the first film or read the first book in the trilogy. But THE TWO TOWERS is equally as good as THE FELLOWSHIP. was. I can't really decide which film is better, or which I would prefer to watch. THE TWO TOWERS is more action packed, and there are the occasional jokes that one can't help but be amused at. The acting in the film is good, what would be expected for such a film. But the acting isn't phony either. In fact, the characters seem very heroic you find yourself and other audience members rooting them on. It's a wonderful film, and what a gift for the holidays to have in theaters. If you were not able to see THE FELLOWSHIP. theatrically, I urge you to see this one theatrically. Especially in a digital sound theater if you can. The film is huge and filled with splendor; it needs to be seen on `the big screen' to be truly appreciated for all that it is. It's become more than a film. Rather, the release of THE TWO TOWERS is an event. I was fortunate enough to see it this morning in Albany at Hoyts Crossgates Cinemas 18, which in my opinion are the finest digital theaters around. And believe me, I've been to many megaplexes from here to Florida. The show was sold out, and the crowd cheered, applauded, and rooted the characters on. Like seeing the original STAR WARS on it's opening day reissue back on January 31, 1997, the crowd was half of the fun of going. These films are amazing. See them and love them for all that they are, extraordinary motion pictures. ****",10,0,0,22 December 2002
The Elephant Man," A remarkable film that should not be forgotten!
","Sometimes the most obscure people can be immortalized for their greatness of simply being.' We are all flawed persons in our own ways. But as we struggle with our own failures at not meeting our own expectations, we forget about the people who have existed, or now exist who suffer greatly, or have been given an unfair lot at life. One such individual was a man named John Merrick who lived in Victorian England. Merrick was born horribly disfigured-his spine crooked, large tumors all over his body, but most noticeably, a large protruding skull. It was this last characteristic that would coin him as the Elephant Man.	It was not until 1980 that a motion picture would be made to examine Merrick's life. Starring John Hurt as Merrick in a performance that could move the heart of the hardiest person, along with Anthony Hopkins as the doctor who would show pity on a soul that most would seek to ridicule, `The Elephant Man' is a remarkable film that should not be forgotten! 	`The Elephant Man' examines Merrick's life from the perspective of the doctor Frederick Treves (Hopkins), who would save Merrick from the freak show where he was tortured and jeered at. Treves takes Merrick to London Hospital where at first, he seems to stick out like a sore thumb, but where he would eventually learn to find his dignity. 	`The Elephant Man' is a truly unique movie that avoids conventional filmmaking techniques and relies upon its set design, excellent performances, and strong direction from a young up-and-coming filmmaker, David Lynch (`Mulholland Dr.'). The film is shot in black and white to create a greater sense of authenticity for the time. Furthermore, the black and white was used as a medium to hide any imperfections within the makeup design for Merrick's face, which was actually modeled upon the body cast of the real Merrick. 	The actors perform with absolute truth and bring dignity and greatness to the real people who lived to see this incredible man rise above his place in the world. Hopkins is outstanding as Treves, and quite convincing as he portrays his emotions in the film. In the scene where Treves first sees Merrick, a solitary tear runs down his face in pity towards another person who had never been shown any prior to that moment. Hurt's performance as the tortured Elephant Man is one of great inspiration. We first find a person who is forbidden to have a voice, but gradually gains the strength to take pride in his natural humanity, regardless of his physical form. (In actuality, the real Elephant Man could barely speak due to the bone structure of his mouth). Hurt also does a great job at presenting the natural conundrum of Merrick's life-his mother died when he was born. He has no direct family relations-no one can love him in such a way because they are not of the same bloodline. What's more, Merrick's mother was a very beautiful woman, and yet Merrick was horribly disfigured. He feels shame and regret for his very being and wants nothing more than to be something special for her. `The Elephant Man' is a reminder of the greatness of the human spirit. Amongst a world filled with despair and grief, this one man was shown a little bit of pity and found a person inside himself that could be proud. Furthermore, he was given the chance to live as normal a life as possible, with a real home and most importantly, real friends. ***1/2",Null,1,1,24 August 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Debatably it is the best film of 2004.
","It's hard to believe it, but Clint Eastwood has done it again. After 2003s 'Mystic River,' he has managed to direct another powerhouse film, but this time about a young female boxer named Maggie played effortlessly by Hillary Swank. She is trained by a hardened, old school trainer named Frankie who at first does not want to be bothered with her since she is a woman and he 'doesn't train girls.' But after some persuasion, Maggie manages to get Frankie to train her and their relationship takes on a father/daughter dynamic. She is poor and far away from home and he has lost his daughter's love by some act we never really know about. They learn to depend on each other for strength and guidance. The love they have is deep and cannot be shattered. With his training and wisdom, Frankie gets Maggie to be a major player in the female boxing arena until she gets injured. It now becomes Frankie's job to look after her and to find a piece of family in the least likely of persons. Amazing performances by Swank and Eastwood, and credit must be given to Morgan Freeman as Frankie's gym manager/assistant and for his narration throughout the picture. Debatably it is the best film of 2004.",10,1,3,31 January 2005
Casualties of War," Incredibly powerful film from Director, Brian De Palma!
","I recently saw this film at my college which had a discussion session about the film afterwords. Starring Micheal J. Fox and Sean Penn, Casualties Of War was a very thought provoking and disturbing motion picture from director Brian De Palma. Taking place during the Vietnam War, it's the story of a group of soldiers whom kidnap, and 4 out of 5 of them rape a Vietnamese woman. Fox plays the one soldier who refuses to rape the woman. In fact, he eventually turns his fellow soldiers in for the rape and murder of an innocent Vietnamese woman. Steller performances from the entire cast make this motion picture a fine one. Great direction from Brian De Palma also helps to elevate this film. I was very impressed with it's dialogue and good acting. Other stars of note in this film are John Leguizamo, John C. Reilly, Ving Rhames, and Dale Dye. This is one of the best war films that I have ever seen. I strongly recommend it for it's challenging the very concept of war and it's affects on soldiers. ***1/2",8,0,0,1 February 2003
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Integrity And Truth In The Public's Best Interests!
","Gorge Clooney takes the director's chair for his second time and has crafted a well detailed and hauntingly documented look at how Edward R. Murrow took on Joe McCarthy in the 1950s. Murrow is played by David Staithairn ('L.A. Confidential') in what has become his most recognized performance. Filmed entirely in black and white to give the film a feel of authenticity, the movie exhibits how scare tactics and the like were used on American society in such frivolous ways that even reporters ran in fear of McCarthy and his committee hearings. But not Murrowthe man set a standard in integrity that has become bedrock in the journalism industry today to report the truth, which was and is always in the public's best interests. His famous lines, 'We will not walk in fear, one of another,' and 'We cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home,' show that he was a reporter out simply to do what was right. It was not about ratings. It was not about vanity. It was not black and white; it was about right and wrong. That standard of integrity is hard to find these days, even in the news business where sensationalism has crafted the news into 'info-tainment.'",10,1,2,4 February 2006
8 Mile," Good Direction by Curtis Hanson!
","Surprisingly good film starring the notorious rapper, Eminem. Directed by Curtis Hanson who's done such films as L.A. Confidential and Wonder Boys. Brian Grazer of A Beautiful Mind produced the film. I admit, I had my worries about this film from the start. I'm not an Eminem fan and when I heard that he was making a movie, I thought this was going to be another teen-music sensation disaster. Some of you must remember Brittany Spears' film; Crossroads released back in February of 2002. And what about the Lance Bass flop, On The Line. Not to worry though, 8 Mile was excellent. The reason I went to see it was because of Curtis Hanson, whose work on L.A. Confidential was enough for me to want to see this film. I was very impressed by most of the performances in the film. However, Kim Basinger, who portrays Eminem's character's mom, isn't all that great. She is believable at times, while other times she's phony. But over all, the film was very impressive. It's important to point out that this film is not about Eminem specifically, but rather, loosely based on his life. ***",8,1,1,18 January 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Overall, `Kill Bill: Vol. 1' is an excellent film as Tarantino proves once again that his talent is unbeaten in this brand of cinema. ****
","Quentin Tarantino returns his talents to theaters with the much anticipated `Kill Bill: Vol. 1.' In a `Charlie's Angels' meets `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' way, Tarantino has crafted a film with excessive violence and gore. Yet, the film is a marvel for its homage to samurai movies, as well as the commonly referred to 'spaghetti westerns,' westerns made in Italy such as `The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.' However, don't expect the entire movie in this showing-it actually runs over three hours and Tarantino cut the film in half. `Kill Bill: Vol. 2' opens in February. `Kill Bill' tells the story of Black Mamba (Uma Thurman), who's referred to as 'the bride,' a member of a band of international assassins whose boss, Bill, and team turn on her. On her wedding day, and being pregnant with her boss's child, she is brutally attacked and shot in the head. Luckily, she manages to survive and wakes up after being in a coma for four years. With the memories of the assault, she manages to escape the hospital seek out her killers. The first of them is Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox), who would appear to be a happy homemaker if it weren't for her deadly intentions. After Black Mamba takes care of Copperhead, she still has unfinished business with three other assassins of Bill's-the only other one we see her take on is Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu). She has to go after the assassins Budd (Michael Madsen), the California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), and Bill (David Carradine). But we'll see those in volume two. Whether you're a fan of Tarantino's style or not, one can't deny his talent. His direction is astonishing, as well as his screenplay. The violence level that he incorporates isn't for the faint of heart. However, it's far more humorous than revolting. Its intention is to be satirical to violence in society and to ultimately pay homage to samurai films that inspired it. After all, don't most films that try to pay tribute to their inspirers by exaggerating the original intention? This is Tarantino's style-he wants us to be shaken and disgusted by the violence. He wants us to the leave the theater feeling tired and affected by it all.Among other creative aspects, there is an anime sequence that shows the history of Cottonmouth. Assassins murdered her parents as she watched it all happen. It's the primary reason she becomes such a bloodthirsty person in her adulthood. You can expect witty dialogue that made `Pulp Fiction' so famous. This film's isn't as ongoing as `Pulp Fiction's,' however, this is only volume one, and Black Mamba hasn't gotten to her conspirator Bill, yet. Undoubtedly, she'll have some choice words for him. Also, consider the fact there's really only one story here. `Pulp Fiction' had several stories intertwining that required a great deal of dialogue to make the connections.Other creative aspects of note that are smaller in scope, but equally important to the greatness of the film are the general format of the film, and the music. The film plays out like that of book. Tarantino splits the film into chapters as it focuses on character and plot development. The music fits the film like a glove. In traditional Tarantino style, he uses a great deal of 70s music that reflects the film's western and samurai impact, with a strong dose of disco which gives the film a hip feel.Overall, `Kill Bill: Vol. 1' is an excellent film as Tarantino proves once again that his talent is unbeaten in this brand of cinema. ****",10,0,1,13 October 2003
For Love of the Game," Fork-in-the-Road Story Gives Way To Sappy Love Story.
","'For Love of the Game' is the story of one baseball player's final game shown through flashbacks from the meeting of a beautiful woman up to the final game in his career. It is a concept that could have worked if the film had not fallen to the melodrama of its love story. Where it manages to stay afloat is in its portrayal of its principal character, Billy Chapel, played by Kevin Costner. In one of the opening scenes, Billy is confronted by the team's owner, Mr. Wheeler (Brian Cox.) Wheeler informs Billy that he has sold the team and the new owners want to trade Billy. Since Billy is 40 years old and at the end of a poor season, Wheeler encourages him to retire. Not exactly what Billy wanted to hear on an exceptionally rough morninghis girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) never showed up for their dinner date the night before. Soon Jane calls and tells Billy that she is moving to London for a new job and that she can no longer be with him. She tells Billy that all he needs are the ball, the plate and the game to get by. With that in mind, Billy heads out to the plate in Yankee Stadium to pitch the last game of the season. He throws well but the slightest reminder of the past triggers bittersweet memories, from meeting Jane, the flourishing of their relationship and their ups and downs. Then Billy remembers when he cut his hand in a sawing accident. Thanks to Jane, he manages to get to a hospital and save his hand. But as Billy recovers, he is faced with the notions that he might never throw again. Unwilling to accept this, he pushes Jane away. This is the point in the present that Billy starts to feel the pain in his arm and his throwing becomes a problem. From the pain his arm, to his regret at loosing Jane, we see Billy struggle to top his career. But he swallows his emotions and pain and remembers the words of his father, 'simply play catch, Billy. Just throw the ball.' With that, Billy manages to pitch the perfect game. But naturally, one thing is missing, Jane and it all leads to inevitable airport confrontation ending. The problem with this movie is not in poor performances, but rather in the sappiness of its love story. Preston plays Jane as the kind of woman who can make the simplest things complicated, but with a genuine tenderness that cannot be denied. She is quirky but cares for Billy. But as the film goes into a montage of their early years, we see just about every relationship cliché play out. She asks him the foreseeable questions'Do you believe in God? Have you ever gotten your heart broken?' And my favorite, 'Do you like the dark meat or the white meat, because the dark meat is the fatty part and it's not good for you.' Between the rolling of my eyes and my cringing at the embarrassment of these questions, I could not help but ask myself, shouldn't they have established all of this long before now? The biggest problem is the ending. The two kiss, and Billy says to Jane that he loves her. Jane responds, 'I never believed it.' Billy replies, 'Believe it.' The two kiss some more and fades out. It leaves you with nothing to embrace and the picture becomes instantly forgettable. You simply want to walk away saying, 'Well, there it is.'What I do like about the movie is that the central character is faced with a life changing decisionending his career, his life's passion. Baseball is what he loves and he cannot let it go. Ironically enough, director Raimi would bring this same concept up in his excellent film, 'Spider-Man 2,' five years after 'For Love of the Game.' As Peter Parker/Spider-Man says, 'Sometimes we have to give up the thing we want the most to do what is righteven our dreams.' That is a tough decision for any person to make when they are part of something they love and for one reason or another, it has to end. In film, if done correctly, this can make for a powerful storytelling riddled with conflict and ultimate resolution. Unfortunately, that is not done here.'For Love of the Game' is neither entirely bad, nor entirely good. The concept of facing the fork-in-the-road choices work well, and adding a love story was to be expected. However, the film becomes half chick-flick and half a story about moving on. If it could only find a better balance with improved writing, it could have worked out. **1/2 out of ****",6,5,11,5 June 2005
Pride & Prejudice," Masterful Cinema
","Jane Austen's classic novel about a young poor woman who falls in love with a rich man is masterfully crafted as one of the best love stories to hit cinema in a very long time. The story crosses the boundaries of Victorian England to be ever pertinent in today's society as it portrays relationships among different classes. Keira Knightly gives the finest performance of her career portraying the strong willed Elizabeth Bennet. Outstanding performances resonate throughout this film, most notably by Matthew Macfadyen, Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn. But it is more than a beautiful and honest love storyit is film-making at its most breathtaking. The cinematography by Roman Oshin is lavish throughout with its continuous shots that had to be meticulously choreographed. The dialogue of the screenplay is taken almost directly from Austen's book and is a fine representation of the era. Even the musical score by Dario Marianelli adds to the greatness of this moving and comical love story that was so finely directed by Joe Wright. It is the year's most delightful film.",10,16,28,4 February 2006
The Last Samurai," Starts our rough, but the film improves immensely.
","Advertisements pushed Edward Zwick's `The Last Samurai' as if it were an Oscar worthy film. In some ways it is, in others, it is not. One cannot deny that the film has fantastic battles scenes, lavish sets and costumes and good performances, but the film struggles to find itself because of the main attraction-Tom Cruise. He is an accomplished actor with undeniable talent. But the problem is that he does not fit the character. Combined with a movie clichés, it leaves some disappointment. However, the film does an about face when the samurai enter. 	Nathan Algren (Cruise) is a former Civil War captain turned drunk because of his inability to deal with his past blunders under command resulting in the massacre of a Native American tribe. Now performing as a Winchester Gun spokesperson, he has been offered an opportunity to go to Japan to train Japanese soldiers to fight a samurai rebellion. He chooses to take the assignment because it offers him $500 a month. Soon after beginning their training, Algren is informed that the samurai intend to attack at a certain place and time. He argues that his men cannot fight the samurai because their training is insufficient. Regardless, he is forced to send his men into battle, which they lose easily. Algren is captured and taken prisoner to the village where the samurai live. While there, he becomes friends with the samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) and learns of their traditions and why they rebel against the new dreams of modernization by the Emperor. Furthermore, he comes to self-actualization in this land where strength of mind and heart counter all. But he will still have to face his old life and former government on the battlefield once more. Cruise is a good bet when casting a film for his appeal among moviegoers. But one cannot cast an actor for that purpose alone. In the beginning, Cruise comes off as an actor trying desperately to play a drunk. Hardly believable when you have someone reading their lines so phonetically. His character should seem cockier, giving a greater presence of his arrogance and ignorance. However, as the film progresses, he falls into the role better. As such, his speaking so perfectly seems appropriate considering he is living a life that requires him to show respect. Another problem is one that I can only blame on the director-a cliché from one of his best films, `Glory.' In `The Last Samurai,' Algren tries to show his soldier's inadequate readiness for battle by having a soldier try to shoot at him. Obviously the soldier misses, but the scene plays out with Algren yelling at the soldier to load his riffle quickly, although he cannot. Algren yells, `DO IT! DO IT!' This is very similar to a scene in `Glory' where Commander Robert Shaw tries to get an African American soldier to do the exact same thing. Most will not recognize the obviousness of this scene. But to film buffs, it will leave a bitter taste on the part of Zwick's direction. The entrance of the samurai is incredible. They come out of the mist of the forest on horseback in slow motion evoking an eerie, yet astonishing sight. This is wherein the film gets far better and pulls itself out the pits of failure. Between lavish battle scenes, light moments of philosophy, and the improving performance on Cruise's part, `The Last Samurai' becomes an epic in movie quality similar to that of `Seabiscuit'-it starts out with clichés and errors, but quickly turns itself around to become a sweeping epic. ***",8,0,0,7 December 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Indeed, it is reloaded!!!
","When `The Matrix' opened in late March of 1999, it was unlike anything audiences had ever seen before. Visually, it was astonishing, introducing the new visual effect technique of Bullettime. The film became a box-office success making around $27 million in its opening weekend, and going on to become one of 1999s biggest box-office smash hits worldwide. But that wasn't the end. It can easily be argued that `The Matrix' revolutionized DVD sales in that it was a top seller for a long period of time. In fact, people were buying DVD players just to have the movie. And so now, at long last, the story continues in one of two films to be released this year, `The Matrix Reloaded,' and indeed, it is reloaded. This film is a lot bigger than it's predecessor and its visual effects are in a word, striking. However, it doesn't feel as remarkable as the first film. But that's hardly saying that it is a let down. On the contrary, `The Matrix Reloaded' is a noteworthy sequel. 	Keanu Reeves (`Speed') returns as the chief character, Neo, the one human who is prophesied to lead all humans against the machines that control everyone in a virtual world known as the matrix. Since we left `The Matrix,' time has passed, and various characters that were a part of Morpheouse's (Larence Fishburne) ship have died (the explained reason for the absence of the character Tank, played by Marcus Chong.) As such, there are new members as part of the crew, and their situation grows darker as war is approaching between the freed minds of the underground city, Zion, and against the machines that control the surface of the earth. As war approaches, Neo is confronted with the notion of loosing his love, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), to the war. Ultimately, he must make decisions that could not only affect his future with Trinity, but decisions that could change the very fate of every living human in world, be they freed or not. It was guaranteed that visually this sequel would be superior to the first film. In many ways, it is. Some of the effects seem to look like that of a computer game, but then again, they are supposed to because that's exactly what the matrix is, a computer generated dream world. Having said that, there are those visual effects shots that just leave the audience blown away!  The first criticism of the film rests in the thought that perhaps its fight scenes were too drawn out and delved into the unnecessary. There are several amazing fight scenes between Neo and agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who has found a way to copy himself. Hence, there are many upon many agent Smiths throughout the film. It seems that the directors, Andy and Larry Wachowski, wanted to wow their audience. They undoubtedly did so, but it was a little over the top. A second complaint would rest in the idea that the scope of the film is enormous. In `The Matrix,' we are presented the fact that a city exists that is the last human city buried deep underground near the earth's core, where it is warm-but we never see it. The scope of the first film is far smaller than this one and just presents ideas for the audience to play on. We don't see much beyond the ship that Neo, Morpheous, and Trinity are plugged into the matrix from. What we see of Zion in this film is extraordinary, but at the same time, the anticipation is gone. It becomes less mysterious and intriguing and becomes more of what is reality. The most impressive parts of the film were those with Fishburne playing Morpheous. Fishburne is a tall, broad man and his presence is extraordinarily heroic. Who wouldn't want to be like Morpheous if they were in the matrix? What's more, the character of Morpheous is portrayed more as a monk than as it was in the previous film, making him seem all the more wiser. Monica Belluci, an Italian actress who has been in such films as `Malena,' and `Tears of the Sun,' joins the series as Persephone, a woman who aids Neo, Morpheous, and Trinity. Belluci is quite possibly the most beautiful woman in the whole of modern cinema. Moreover, she is an accomplished actress and her very presence adds a captivating feel to the film. Essentially, `The Matrix' films are exactly like the `Star Wars' and `Lord of the Rings' films in that all three deal with the classic mythological concept of good verses evil. But what separates all three films is their setting and characters. There will be more films that deal in the same genre in years to come that will astound audiences with similar stories. But for now, `The Matrix Reloaded' is a dazzling visual achievement and a great sequel. However, the first film remains to be the best of the series, so far. FYI-stay until the end of the credits and see the teaser trailer for `The Matrix Revolutions,' due out on November 7. ***",8,0,0,19 May 2003
Mystic River," Quite possibly one of the finest American films of the past decade.
","Think back on the best movies of the previous ten years. Films like `Pulp Fiction,' `Fargo,' and `American Beauty' probably come to mind. Now, consider adding `Mystic River,' the new film from Clint Eastwood, to that list. It is one of the most stirring and enthralling American movies of 2003! This can be attributed to its fantastic cast including Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon and to the impeccable direction of Eastwood. Based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, `Mystic River' tells a story that is so riveting that the audience cannot pull themselves away from it.	`Mystic River' tells the story of three childhood friends whose lives are forever changed by appalling events. While children playing in the streets of a Boston suburb, one of the boys named Dave Boyle is kidnapped and abused for four days. Twenty-five years later, another one of the three friends, Jimmy Markum (Penn), is devastated by the murder of his nineteen-year-old daughter. The murder unites Jimmy and Dave (Robbins), as well as their friend Sean (Bacon), the detective assigned to the case. With the help of fellow detective Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne), Sean uncovers past secrets about both Jimmy and Dave, from Jimmy's time spent in prison to Dave's emotional stress relating back to his childhood abduction. The end result reveals fact and faux pas about each man that they all hoped would be buried forever. The amazing aspect of `Mystic River' is that it shows how one event can lead to future personal flaws. Indeed the event of the Dave's kidnapping as a child wounded all of the boys. Both Jimmy and Sean both comment, `imagine how life would be if I had gotten in that car instead of Dave.' Dave's scares are apparent in his disillusionment of the reality around him. He can't seem to connect with anybody except his son who he feels a need to keep life innocent for since Dave's childhood innocence was so horribly taken away. Jimmy spent time behind bars for a robbery and now he's become a crime boss that everybody respects in the Boston suburb. As for Sean, he's managed to ruin his marriage because he shut his wife out of his own feelings and needs. 	The performances are extraordinary! Penn gives a stellar performance that will undoubtedly garnish him a nomination for the Best Actor Oscar.  He leaves the audience shaken in so many scenes. Particularly the scene where he finds about his daughter's death: one, for the very fact that she was murdered and two, because she was only nineteen. After all, what parent would want to bury their child? It should be the other way around.	Robbins gives an excellent performance as Dave, the troubled man dealing with his past by not dealing with reality. It's troubling to watch this tragic character and his emotions unfold. You can't help but feel his pain. At the same point, you realize that he is not dealing with reality completely and he needs help. 	Bacon and Fishburne are equally incredible for their roles as detectives. Since Bacon's character, Sean, has a past with Jimmy and Dave, Fishbune's character, Whitey, acts as a voice of reason. He reminds Sean to look past the loyalties of friendship and to conduct the case in a proper manner.	Eastwood has crafted a film filled with intrigue for its troubled characters and for its absorbing story. Undoubtedly this film will be considered at Oscar time. What's more, it is quite possibly one of the finest American films of the past decade. ****",10,1,2,2 November 2003
Love Actually," `Love Actually' is a treat this holiday season and is easily the best romantic comedy of the year.
","The opening solo of `Moulin Rouge' made the comment, `The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return.' In `Love Actually' we get the same feel, except with combination of romantic, friendship, and familial love. It works remarkably well! `Love Actually' was written by Richard Curtis, who brought us `Notting Hill' and `Bridget Jones's Diary.' Curtis has a knack for showing the realities behind love that is not as sugar coated as the common Hollywood melodrama.	Hugh Grant plays the Prime Minister of Britain. He opens the film with a narration on the greatness of love. We get that impression as we follow all the characters as they struggle to accept the difficulties that come with love. No one just gets up one day and automatically finds that perfect someone. Sometimes, that perfect person is someone we cannot have. For instance, the character Mark (Andrew Lincoln) is in love with his best friend's wife, Juliet (Keira Knightley). In one scene, he goes to his friend's house, knowing that Juliet will answer the door. He signals for her to keep quiet, and he plays Christmas carols from a radio to sound like carolers. He then holds up poster boards in which he writes how much he loves her. She is flattered by it, but they both know that this will be the only time that such affections can ever be shown. It is one of conundrums of love-more often than not, it is kept a secret inside that person's heart when they want to tell the world. The scene is easily the film's most charming moment.  	Another hard fact that `Love Actually' faces is adultery and the pains that it can cause spouses-not from sexual infidelity, but from the loss of love. This happens between the married characters of Harry (Alan Rickman) and Karen (Emma Thompson). Harry is approached with the sexual interest of his secretary. Karen discovers the affair when she finds a gift that Harry plans to give to his secretary. Karen questions Harry as to what he would do if he found a gift that was meant for someone else that she loved, and approached the subject of splitting up. She says, `Would you stay, knowing that life would be a bit worse? Or would you cut and run?' 	One of the film's cuter tales follows the character Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster). Sam keeps a secret-he loves a girl at school who is leaving soon. When he finally reveals it to his father's chagrin, the two conceive plans to let the girl know that Sam loves her. It leads to some of the film's cutest moments that would make us all laugh at our own childhood escapades to get to the ones we are in love with. 	`Love Actually' is marvelous in its humor. There are quotes that would make us smile and those that would give us all a good belly laugh. The funniest moment in the film, seen in the trailer, occurs when Bill Nighy, who plays an old rock-star making a comeback, is interviewed on the radio. When he is questioned as to whom he has had the best sex with, his answer is `Britney Spears. No, only kidding, she was rubbish!' 	There is some rough language and a few scenes with nudity, but this is clearly a film for adults. In the end, `Love Actually' is a treat this holiday season and is easily the best romantic comedy of the year. ***1/2",9,0,2,14 December 2003
Downfall," A deeply disturbing, intimate portrait of the insanity of Hitler and the blind faith of his followers at the end.
","In recent years, war films have given a new exposure to the sheer nature of war. In 'Saving Private Ryan,' 'Black Hawk Down' and 'Born on the Fourth of July,' we were exposed to the realities that a soldier endures not only on the battlefield, but what they take with them long after the battles end. However, 'Downfall,' a German film nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2005 Oscars, brings a unique perspective to the table. It is about the last days of Hitler and the Third Reich and the ultimate demise of both. More so than a war movie, this feature exposes the insanity of Hitler and the blind faith of his followers at the end. It is a deeply disturbing, intimate portrait of the cruelty that he inflicted not only upon 6 million Jews, but ultimately on his own countryman at the end.Based on the book 'Inside Hitler's Bunker' by Joachim Fest, 'Downfall' is in a word, shocking. The last act in the great horrific play of the Third Reich plays out like that of a cultso many men and woman who swore allegiance to Hitler commit suicide by either shooting themselves in the head or by ingesting poison capsules. But the madness of Hitler himself is horrifically captivating. He changes his mind and opinion on a whim. One moment he advises his SS-Guards and Generals to leave the city after learning that he does not have enough troops to protect Berlin. A particular one named Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein , who was Eva Braun's brother-in-law, takes the Fuhrer for his word and leaves Berlin. When Hitler realizes this, he denounces Fegelein and orders him executed. What is more, Hitler discusses the final demise of the German people. He explains that this failure is not only that of the military, but of the civilians themselves. As such, his soldiers do not protect the people from the coming onslaught of the Soviet Army. He advises, 'In a war as such there are no civilians.' Hitler is recreated by the superlative performance of Bruno Ganz, who appeared in the 2004 remake of 'The Manchurian Candidate.' Ganz captures the movement, voice, even the involuntary shaking of Hitler's left hand so well, that the audience would feel as if they are watching the dictator himself. We are often left with shivers down our spine at how realistic Ganz's depiction is. Surprisingly enough, Thomas Kretschmann, who played the Nazi captain that gave Wladyslaw Szpilman a coat and food in 'The Pianist' is seen here as Fegelein. I first noticed Kretschmann as a German U-Boat commander in 2000s, 'U-571.' He is a remarkable actor who brings with him a demanding presence on the screen through his stern looks and ultimate resolve. Unfortunately my knowledge of Eva Braun other than Hitler's mistress is limited. So it was refreshing to see a film that revealed her. Based on 'Downfall's' depiction, Braun, portrayed by Juliane Kohler, was either one of the shallowest individuals I have ever seen, or she was so blinded by her faith in Hitler that she disregarded almost any sense of reality. For example, during Berlin's first days of bombardment, she becomes bored with being in the bunker and orders a party in an above ball roomnot surprisingly during that party a shell lands nearby and blows out windows in the room. Secondly, during later heavy bombardment, realizing that she will commit suicide with Hitler, she writes a letter to a relative where she states what jewelry she will leave behind. She is simply detached from reality and lost in the fanatical jargon of the Fuhrer. Certainly the film's most disturbing instances occur when Magda and Joseph Goebbels poison their children in the name of the Fatherland. One of their children, a girl probably about 10 years old, has a dim understanding of what is happening and refuses to take the drink given. She is then forced to drink it by her mother and a guard. Later on, Magda would come into her children's room while they were asleep and would give them the final capsule to eliminate them. 'Downfall' is certainly one of the most powerful film's I have ever seen. As stated above, Hitler and his followers played out their existence as if they were in a cult. The blind faith of his followers and the insanity of the man are so well realized by director Oliver Herschbiegel, that it changes one's perception from that of simply being history to that of realism. These events happened less than a century ago and although most have learned to forgive Germany's past, no one will ever forget it. It is the stigma that haunts this generation of German youth because many of their grandparents or great-grandparents were a part of one of history's most infamous armies. But the fact that this film is German was surprising to me. I would have guessed that no one in Germany would have wanted to dig up their past in this way. However, if one looks at this film as closure to Germany's transgressions, then maybe this new generation of German youth can learn to have a sense of national identity without the horrors of the past seen in their shadows. **** out of ****",10,118,131,5 June 2005
Jaws," INCREDIBLE FILM!!!!
","Wow!!! Easily one of Steven Spielburgh's best films of all, however, aren't all of his movies. Anyway, this is just wonderful. Spielburgh uses very little of the shark to create a fear, or tension in the viewers mind. We don't see much of the shark, but the fear of it is heart pounding. I couldn't believe it. A few years ago, I was flipping through the tv channels and came across JAWS being shown for it millionth time. I decided to give it a chance considering I had never watched it before then. Luckily, I came across the part of Cheif Brody (Roy Scheider) chumming, and complaining about doing it. Then, out of nowhere the sharks head comes out of the water to collect some of the chum. My heart stopped for a few seconds, and I turned white. I was absolutly terrified. I feel the blood tingling in my arms as I watched the scene unravel. Absolutly terrifying! Not only that, the story of the USS Idianapolis by Quint (Robert Shaw) is enthralling. The performances by every actor in this film are supperb. The is a classic, and far supperior to DEEP BLUE SEA, or any of the other JAWS films. JAWS 2 is a good sequel, but ultimately, not as good as JAWS. Although, I would recommed seeing JAWS 2, because it is a good film, and it is scary. However, I didn't see JAWS 3, and I bought JAWS: The Revenge on dvd because it was dirt cheap. Just forget about JAWS: THE REVENGE; it's terrible. Most of all, just stick with the first two films. They are great. But JAWS itself is easily one of the best movies ever made!",10,2,4,20 June 2002
Bruce Almighty," The film lacks an element that audiences love Jim Carrey for-comedy.
","After Jim Carrey's unsuccessful attempts to create a serious acting career with films like `The Majestic,' and `Man on the Moon,' he has decided to return to his old brand of slapstick humor in the new film `Bruce Almighty' from director Tom Shadyac (`Patch Adams'). Unfortunately, the film lacks an element that audiences love Jim Carrey for-comedy. The movie's highest points have already been seen in the trailers for the film. Ironically enough, audiences seemed most amused by those same jokes: the dog using the toilet, Carrey stepping in a pothole, etc. It just goes to show that most comic films are nothing more than rehashed, simple jokes, rather than something that is actually funny. `Bruce Almighty' is the story of a man named Bruce (Carrey), who hates his life. He's a reporter who gets the crap jobs at his station, and it seems like the whole world is ignoring his talents. His negative attitude is even starting to affect his relationship with his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston). After loosing his job, Bruce starts to blame God for his lot in life. Low and behold, God (Morgan Freeman) shows up and gives Bruce all of his powers. Naturally, Bruce indulges in all the incredible abilities that God gives him and his life starts to improve. But what Bruce doesn't realize is that being God involves a lot more than improving his own life; he needs to help others who truly need it, as well. The plot is as trivial as they come. After about the first hour, some people may want to leave the theater. But things start to turn in favor of the film towards the last half-hour, as the film takes on a deeper, more meaningful tone. Ergo, the last thirty minutes of `Bruce Almighty' proves to be its own saving grace. Carrey is a great comedian, but one can't deny that the one-liners and old jokes are becoming boring. Instead of `alrighty then,' we now have `b-e-a-utiful.' The film isn't devoid of some original jokes, however. One scene shows Bruce on the rise in his ratings in which he earns the title 'Mr. Exclusive' because he finds the body of Jimmy Hoffa. Another scene shows Bruce doing an interview when all of a sudden, a meteor hits the earth in the background and since he's the only reporter around, the story becomes his. But when a film runs for 94 minutes and all it can depend on upon are moments of humor, it shows that someone should go back to the drawing board and start over. Shadyac is a fair director whose primary claim to fame have been comedies. Shadyac's `Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' was Carrey's first hit comedy, pushing him into the public eye. Shadyac's problem though is that all of his comic films are alike-they involve characters that are unhappy with their existence and through a blend of humor and emotion, they rise above themselves to become better people. Nevertheless, this scenario is old. If Shadyac wants to be remembered as a really good director, he needs to become more diverse in the film's he chooses. The only dramatic film that he's done to date has been 'Dragonfly' which starred Kevin Costner.`Bruce Almighty' has proven to be a big hit at the box-office. Perhaps most people just want the same thing over and over when they see a film. If this is what you are interested in, `Bruce Almighty' is the right ticket for you. If not, rent something that is actually funny like `Best in Show' or `The Naked Gun.'  **1/2",6,0,0,2 June 2003
Signs," M. Night Shyamalan does it again!
","Director M. Night Shyamalan of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, has returned to bring us another scary tale. Except, this time it doesn't deal with ghosts or comic book salesmen gone nuts, but rather it deals with aliens. This film is comparable to Steven Spielberg's Jaws, in which, we don't see much gore, or the thing that is meant to scare us. Rather, Shyamlan builds up the suspense and plays off of the audience's fear of the subject matter. The film stars Mel Gibson as a farmer in Pennsylvania who is more thank shocked to find out that there are crop circles in his cornfield. Great performances by Gibson, as well as by Joaquin Phoenix make the film memorable. Also, the dialogue is wonderful. Shyamalan is truly one of the finest filmmakers out there today. ***",9,0,2,18 January 2003
Identity," A very chilling thrill ride!
","Having never really been a fan of the horror genre, upon first hearing of `Identity,' it seemed easy to dismiss. However, it wasn't easy to dismiss the cast: John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, and Alfred Molina. Although these actors haven't always chosen the best screen stories, they are still respectable and for the most part a good bet when casting for a movie.After seeing `Identity,' the only conclusion that one could come to was that this film, although grizzly, was not really a horror film. In fact, to call it a horror film is disgraceful considering most horror flicks are just cheap, rehashed slasher movies that are geared for the teenyboppers. What separates `Identity' in terms of scary films is the mystery that surrounds it. An interesting story, and ultimately a mind-bender, `Identity' proves itself to be a very chilling thrill ride. `Identity' tells the story of ten people who are stranded at a motel during a powerful thunderstorm that has flooded most of the roads in the region. However, during their night at the motel, people start dying. Everyone is suspect and everyone is also innocent, as the killer is remote to the strangers. The killings seem to be ritualistic in that whoever the killer is, his or her signature card is a key tag for the rooms of the motel. In other words, as the murderer does the job, he or she counts down with every dead body, starting from ten. The events all lead to an ending that is as shocking as the murders themselves. At first, the film feels reminiscent of Hitchcock's `Psycho,' in that the events take place at a highway motel during a storm. That may have been some of the inspiration of horror screenwriter, Michael Cooney, whose credits include `Jack Frost,' (not to be confused with the Michael Keaton family film), and `Tracks Of A Killer.' James Mangold directed `Identity.' His work includes such films as the 2001 almost romantic comedy, `Kate & Leopold,' which starred the over-used, romantic comedy star Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman. Mangold also directed the critically successful film, `Girl, Interrupted,' which starred Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder. His direction here is good and he tries to incorporate a bit of chill in the cinematography by occasionally throwing in a still image to throw the audience off. The technique is not all that impressive but kudos should to be granted for his trying.One scene in particular was somewhat spooky. The power goes out at the motel and while Liotta's character is outside, he slowly comes around the side of the motel. While lightening flashes and the rain beads off his face, the impression that it gives the audience is that he's doesn't have a chance of surviving the night and he's already dead. Performances in `Identity' were good. Cusack plays Ed, a retired cop, now limousine driver. He, along with supposed cop, Rhodes, played by Liotta, try to take control of the events taking place by continually searching the motel for answers of who the killer is. Peet, the gorgeous actress of such films as `The Whole Nine Yards,' and `Whipped,' plays Paris, a hooker trying to turn her life around. Molina, the star of last year's `Frida,' plays a psychiatrist bent on finding out what happened during the night at the motel. Other stars of the film include John Hawkes (`The Perfect Storm'), John C. McGinley (`Office Space'), Rebecca De Mornay (`Backdraft'), Clea DuVall (`The Faculty'), Jake Busey (`Contact'), and William Lee Scott (`October Sky'). All in all, `Identity' affirms itself as an absorbing show that plays with our fears and with our minds. ***",8,0,0,27 April 2003
X2: X-Men United," Superior to the first film!
","When we left the X-Men in the first movie, Magneto was caught and placed in a plastic prison and Wolverine was leaving Professor Xavier's school for mutant children in a search for answers to his past. We are now re-united with the X-Men in the second film of what looks to become a series in `X2: X-Men United.' 	This is the first of many sequels due out during the 2003 summer box-office season. One thing may make this film stand out among every other sequel this summer-the fact that it's very good. In fact, `X2: X-Men United' is the rare case in which a sequel didn't follow the conventional clichéd patterns that so many sequels do by rehashing everything the first film; thus, the reason why sequels are generally inferior movies when compared to their predecessors. 	The story centers on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) seeking clues to his past-an experiment that left his skeleton covered in a very strong metal. And of course, this metal makes his character more deadly considering the fact that he has blades that protrude from his knuckles whenever he senses danger. But things change for all mutants when a mutant assassin named Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), tries to kill the president in protest of a Mutant Registration Act.' This attempt only increases the fear that many have for the mutants and leads a military leader named William Stryker (Brian Cox) to lead a campaign against the mutants, beginning with Professor Xavier's school. It's now up to all mutants, be they friend or foe, to unite against an enemy that could eliminate all mutants. 	It's clear that director Bryan Singer (`Apt Pupil,' `The Usual Suspects') had more freedom in the production. The film is longer than the first film by about 30 minutes. What's more, it isn't as flashy as the original film. Point in fact; it is a far darker tale that leaves its central characters in the worst possible situation, a rule that is often ignored in sequels or trilogies. 	I did like the fact that this film united all mutants, putting aside their differences in an attempt to save their race. After seeing the first `X-Men,' I felt that there were some gaps in the dialogue, and the film quickly moved from one scene to the next. But that complaint was minor, as the first film was rather impressive. Nonetheless, `X2' is more than a worthy sequel; filled with great action sequences along with impressive visual effects that it doesn't rely on to tell the story, it's arguably better than the first film. Patrick Stewart (`Conspiracy Theory') returns as Charles Xavier, as does Ian McKellen (`Gods And Monsters') as Magneto. Anna Paquin (`25th Hour') returns as Rogue who takes Iceman's breath away, played by Shawn Ashmore. Aaron Stanford (`Tadpole') ignites the screen as Pyro. Dr. Jean Grey, played by Famke Janssen (`Goldeneye') tries to avoid temptation with Wolverine, while Scott Summers, played by James Marsden (`Gossip') tries to control his temper with Wolverine. And of course, the X-Men wouldn't be complete without Storm, played by Halle Berry (`Monster's Ball'), around to wreak havoc.	 Released on what has become the typical starter weekend of the summer box-office, `X2' looks to become a huge smash hit with early weekend estimates predicting the film to make nearly $86 million in nationwide ticket sales.  It's not as large as last year's magnanimous opening weekend for `Spider-Man,' which made $114 million, but it is doubtful that Twentieth Century Fox will be complaining much about the success of the film.`X2: X-Men United' is a true blockbuster that is a real crowd-pleaser in which it is difficult to find something to criticize. ***",8,2,4,4 May 2003
Final Destination," This film is so bad, it's insulting!
","Well what can one expect from director James Wong, whose other claim to fame was another terrible film released back in early November of 2001 -The One, which starred Jet Li. I just found Final Destination to be so insulting as a film on so many different levels. It's obvious that I don't like the director's work at all. But the acting is awful, as well. Afterall, it is nothing more than some dumb teeny-bopper horror flick. And the talent that it brought into to perform for these films is never all that great to begin with. Also, the parts of the film that were supposed to be scary or shocking, came off as stupidly funny. I couldn't wait for this film to end, and I do NOT recommend seeing it. The release of Final Destination 2 has just hit theaters and naturally every teen in the country wants to see it. The only thing that might be good about the sequel is a car crash that is supposedly filmed very well. But beyond that, it doesn't appear very promising either. BOMB.",1,4,8,6 February 2003
Rear Window," A Classic!!!
","Rarely does a motion picture come along that is so genuinely intense that it sends cold chills down one's spine. This was a knack that late director Alfred Hitchcock immersed his films in-particularly, `Rear Window.' Starring the late, great Jimmy Stewart and the gorgeous Grace Kelly, `Rear Window' is a spine tingling film that leaves the audience guessing and one the edge of their seat. 	L. B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (Steward) sits in his apartment, stuck in a wheel chair with a broken leg after photographing a car accident. He's been there for nearly seven weeks and all he does is watch out his apartment's back window at the other tenants in their apartments across his backyard. All seems normal until one night he hears a scream and notices that in one apartment, a woman who was sick in bed is no longer there. And her husband, a salesman, has been leaving the house late at night. Jeff suspects the man has killed his wife, but can't prove it. Jeff's story seems contrived and silly to his nurse, a close friend, and his girlfriend Lisa (Kelly). But clues soon turn up that will leave these characters forever changed.	Hitchcock masterfully directs this classic from 1954. The one astounding aspect of `Rear Window' is that it all takes place inside Jeff's apartment. The camera never leaves the room, except to occasionally pan around the exterior of the backyard. Also, Hitchcock sets up interesting characters in each of the apartments. There are the newlyweds, a woman who is an artist, a woman who is a dancer, a man struggling with writing music that will sell, and another woman who is so distraught from lonliness that Jeff refers to her as Miss Lonely Heart.' 	The performances of `Rear Window' are some of best ever captured on celluloid. Naturally, Stewart can't touch a film without turning it to gold with his down-to-earth appeal. Kelly lights up the screen with her beauty and intriguing nature. Thelma Ritter is witty and engaging as Jeff's nurse, Stella, who provides her own insight into the relationship of Jeff and Lisa, but also into the possible murder. Wendell Corey plays Thomas Doyle, Jeff's friend who is an investigator. He gives his own explanation for the disappearance of the man's wife-she could have gone to visit family, or left him. And lastly, Raymond Burr plays Lars Thorwald, the man whose wife goes missing. Burr is terrifying in his portrayal as the strange salesman. 	All in all, `Rear Window' proudly takes its place among the top 100 movies of all time from the American Film Institute (AFI). It's certainly one of the best movies ever made not so much because it has the ability to terrify its audience, but because of the brilliance in the filmmaking by arguably the greatest director of all time, Hitchcock. `Rear Window' is available for rental at local video stores. ****",Null,4,7,1 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best aspect of `Return of the King' would be its emotion.
","Peter Jackson's completed `Lord of the Rings Trilogy' is by far one of the finest trilogies in cinematic history. Moreover, its final film `The Return of the King' is possibly the best of the three. Why? We are so taken by the film's intensity from its epic battle scenes to the struggle of Frodo and Sam in their quest to rid the world of the ring. What plays out on the screen moves us and rouses us in ways that drive us to tears and applause during the final act. But the most saddening part for the moviegoer is that it is over. The film begins with the history of Gollum finding the ring and killing his friend Deagol for it. Then the films picks up where `The Two Towers' left off; a return to Rohan and the decision to help defend the last stronghold of men, Minas Tirith, from the dark lord Sauron. But the peril of the ring bearer deepens. Frodo and Sam move closer to Mount Doom every day with their guide Gollum. To be expected, Gollum still wants the ring for himself. He does this by pitting Frodo and Sam against each other because he knows that Sam does not trust him. As such, the journey grows darker for Frodo and Sam as mistrust develops, and the weight of the ring grows on Frodo. Between the last battle for Middle Earth at Minas Tirith, and struggle for Frodo to destroy the ring, `The Return of the King' guides the characters into challenges that were unheard of in its previous stories. What's more-an unforgettable ending. 	Naturally, one would expect the highest level of visual effects-we certainly get them. The battle at Minas Tirith is one of the grandest battle sequences ever put on celluloid, although it is only a visual effect. Armies of thousands upon thousands of orcs storm the city, while a group of riders on horses storm the army. The scene is amazing as we watch the men on horseback ride hard into battle. Their speed is amazing, as are their efforts at destroying the army. Furthermore, the design of Minas Tirith is exquisite. The creation of the city was two fold-partly built in a large quarry where the scene for Helms Deep was made for `The Two Towers.' Also, some of the shots were made out of a small model combined with computer generated visual effects. The end result gives such grand detail, that we can even see the weathering of the city's stone. 	The best aspect of `Return of the King' would be its emotion. The possibility of the death of Frodo or Sam will drive even the strongest person to tears. For me, the most memorable and heart wrenching scene is where Frodo has collapsed in Sam's arms as they climb up the side of Mount Doom. Sam tries to remind Frodo of memories of the Shire in spring, but Frodo's response is `I can't recall the taste of food, the sound of water, or the touch of grass.' It becomes ever clearer what Frodo is trying to save, home. Furthermore, it shows how fragile the things that we take for granted in life really are-warm days filled with sunlight, times with friends, and the beauty of nature. 	Although for some it may be difficult after such a long time sitting through the movie, stay through the end credits and listen to the beautiful song, `Into the West' performed by Annie Lennox. It is remarkably moving, as is the score by composer Howard Shore. ****",10,0,0,21 December 2003
Munich," One of 2005s Best Films!
","This is one of Spielberg's best films. The reason for that is simply that Spielberg addresses both sides of the issues between Israelis and Palestinians. Certainly he is pro-Israeli. But he is not anti-Palestinian. What we see in 'Munich' that is even more convincing is how the leader of the Israeli assassination squad, Avner, played by Eric Bana, is that with every step of reciprocity that the Israeli's take, they lose something more internalizedtheir very identity is threatened to become everything that they have sought to prove and believed in. For example, in one scene, one member on the squad approaches Avner and says that he cannot go on doing this. He begins to weep. He says he doesn't even feel Jewish anymore and that the ones involved in the terrorist plot in Munich must be brought to justicenot simply murdered. As the film approaches its end, we see Avner, then living in New York City with his wife and child. After his mission, he has become extremely paranoid and feels that the Israeli Government may be trying to kill him to cover up any relationship to the assassination squad. One of the government officials played by Geoffrey Rush approached him and tells him essentially to calm down and not worrythey aren't after him. However, as their conversation goes on, Bana invites Rush's character to dinner at his home. Bana says something along the lines of, 'Well, you're a Jew. I'm a Jew. Isn't their something written in stone that I have to invite you to my home for dinner? We can break bread together.' Rush's character simply says no and walks away. You come to realize that everything they stood for has been lost in search of revenge, rather than justice. It all comes to bare on the most popular quote in the movie, given by the actress who plays Golda Meir, 'Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values.'",10,0,1,8 January 2006
Gangs of New York," Best Picture 2002!
","GANGS OF NEW YORK [R] Running Time, 3 hours: 10 minutes (with trailers)Starring: Leonardo Dicaprio Cameron Diaz Daniel Day-Lewis	It had been one hell of a week to go to the movies. First, came the release of The Two Towers, the much-anticipated Lord Of The Rings sequel. Now we have Martin Scorsese's new film, Gangs Of New York. It stars Leonardo Dicaprio (Titanic), Cameron Diaz (Charlie's Angels), and Daniel Day-Lewis (The Last Of The Mohicans). This film has had a lot of buzz generated about it lately. Some from the fact that is being released against another Dicaprio film in another week, Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can. But also due to the fact that Gangs looks to be one of the year's finest motion pictures. And currently, probably the best film playing next to The Two Towers. Unfortunately, none of our local cinemas have received a print of it. In fact, I saw in Burlington yesterday. However, we may be lucky enough within the upcoming weeks to see it one of our local marquees. Until then, I guess you'll just have to wait unless you are willing to see it Montreal, or Burlington. 	Taking place in New York City during the mid-1800s amidst the upcoming Civil War, it tells the story of a young Irish-man named Amsterdam Vallon who witnessed his father's death as a boy in a rough area of New York called The Five Points. His father, played by Liam Neeson, is an Irish Priest and leads the other Irish against the a rival gang in the New York at the time headed by Daniel Day-Lewis's character, Bill the Butcher. After witnessing his father's demise at the hand of Bill the Butcher, Amsterdam is sent to an orphanage, and when he gets old enough he sets out on his own with the intention of getting revenge for his father's death. Amsterdam allies himself with Bill the Butcher, and learns how to handle the tough streets of the Five Points. Along the way, he meets a beautiful woman played by Cameron Diaz, called Jenny Everdeane. Jenny is a pickpocket and is Amsterdam's love interest in the film. However, as time goes on and Amsterdam and Jenny become closer, a friend of Amsterdam's named Johnny Sirocco, played by Henry Thomas (E.T., All The Pretty Horses) and also in love with Jenny, finds out about the affair between Amsterdam and Jenny. Johnny, filled with jealousy sells Amsterdam out to Bull the Butcher, who did not realize that Amsterdam was the son of the Irish priest he killed so many years before. Now the battle lines are being drawn between the natives of New York and Irish, blacks, and other immigrants who make up the rival faction of Amsterdam, called the Dead Rabbits. 	The film is truly stunning. As stated before, it takes place against the Civil War and declaration of the draft by Lincoln. New York City was in chaos at the time with rioters and looters protesting the war. It actually led to Marshall Law being declared in the city. The film portrays these scenes with great precision and accuracy. Another great quality of the film is it's set design, which is immense and there is no digital affect here that isn't real. What you see, is what you get in this film, and we see quite a bit. The performances are superb from every member of the cast. I can't think of a single one to complain about. Also, the music used in the film is very good, as well. It contains some score composed by Academy Award winning composer, Howard Shore (Lord Of The Rings). U2 does a song, which doesn't appear in the film, but probably during the end credits and on the soundtrack called, `The Hands That Built America.' Not to mention the countless other pieces music that are used in the film; traditional folk songs from all walks of life  most notably Celtic music. Scorsese did a wonderful job directing this film, and is quite possibly one of the best, if not the best film of year. However, I'm cautious to say that Gangs Of New York is the best film of the year because there is still another film, at least on my list, that is note worthy to see: Catch Me If You Can, also starring Leonardo Dicaprio. ****",9,0,0,30 December 2002

Born on the Fourth of July," 'There was another war waiting for the soldiers when they returned home.'
","When asked why he wanted to make another film about Vietnam after the success of 'Platoon,' Oliver Stone is quoted as saying, 'There was another war waiting for the soldiers when they returned home.' Indeed, he was right. 'Born On the Fourth Of July,' based on the book by Ron Kovic, follows Kovic's account of his experiences in Vietnam and the indifferent nation that he returned to. Although released in 1989, it holds up to the current situation that exists in Iraq now-many refer to it as the new Vietnam. Regardless of anyone's opinion on the current Iraq war, 'Born On the Fourth of July' is one of the most affecting, and important war related films of all time. As the film opens, we find a young Kovic pretending to be a soldier with friends-a time when the idea of being a soldier was heroic since their father's had been heroes in WWII. The film then follows Kovic as a popular athlete in high school up to his recruitment as a Marine. Kovic rationalizes his reasons for joining up as Communists have missiles pointed at us now and we have to save our country from its threats. During his time in Vietnam, Kovic sees the true nature of war. His platoon mistakenly fires upon a town where the enemy is supposedly hiding; however, they end up killing women and children. During the confusion that follows, Kovic accidentally shoots a fellow soldier-his guilt would encompass him for years to come. But when Kovic himself is wounded in a field, he is sent home paralyzed from the waist down. He spends the first few months in a veteran hospital, which in this case, was a slum. The doctors inform him that he will never be able to use his legs again, and that he no longer has the ability to have children. When he returns to his home, he realizes that the world has changed. People protest the war, sometimes protesting against the soldiers themselves. His own family is indifferent to the war, as are his old friends. In one scene, he is told by an old friend who has become successful as a fast food manager, 'people here-they don't give a s**t about the war! To them it's just a million miles away.'Eventually becoming disillusioned by everything in his hometown, Kovic spends a great deal of time with other veterans like himself at a resort in Mexico. Later he becomes an activist-his first public activism took place at the 1972 Republican National Convention where he was televised for exposing the reality of what soldiers endured in Vietnam, but also on the reasons why we did not belong there in the first place. 'Born On the Fourth of July' spends a good deal of time focusing on the misplaced patriotism that the politicians spewed at the public to drum up support not only for Vietnam, but the Cold War, in general. The film shows this by Kovic's own mother constantly reminding her son that he was doing the right thing by going over there and fighting and that he was in God's hands. When Kovic returns home and his disillusionment grows, he gets drunk one night and yells at his mother, 'There is no God. There is only me in this chair for the rest of my life!'The film does stand up today just as strong as ever. With soldiers returning home from Iraq, and the constant media attention of terrorist attacks over there and seeing our own soldiers ambushed all the time, those who fight now must feel the same anger and frustration that Kovic felt year ago. It does make one wonder, when will the politicians ever truly get it! ****",10,0,1,24 October 2004
Goodfellas," A Mob-Epic!
","There is a fascination with the underworld that exists in everyone. We find ourselves drawn to the headlines of gang wars and those caught in the middle. After all, Al Copone was a crook, but also a celebrity. It is this fascination that has captivated audiences with gangster pictures from the 1930s with James Cagney in 'The Public Enemy' to the more recent 'Goodfellas' from director Martin Scorsese. The latter picture, with its sense of realism, like 'The Public Enemy' stands the test of time. Its characters are every bit as terrifying, especially Tommy De Vito played by Joe Pesci as was Cagney's portrayal of Tom Powers. And of course with Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta, one can only expect explosive portrayals. 'Goodfellas' tells the story of Henry Hill (Liotta), who from childhood had aspirations of being a gangster. He starts out small, parking Cadillacs for wise guys and eventually works his way up to top of the food chain. By the time he is 21, he has more money than anyone else does his age, a sexy girlfriend, and the respect of the mob. Henry soon teams up with Tommy De Vito (Pesci) and the two work the streets with Jimmy Conway (De Niro) for Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino). What begins, as robbery becomes another crime: murder, extortion, booze, etc. But after Henry gets married and finds himself rooted deeper into the mob, he begins to take on more than he can handle. Director Scorsese grew up on the streets of New York and witnessed the rough life that people could have. He incorporates his own history into the characters of the film. This is a common practice in most of his films from 'Raging Bull,' 'Taxi Driver,' and 'Mean Streets,' as he has a fascination and love for the Big Apple. But the most obvious aspect of that life is the violence. It is portrayed in 'Goodfellas' from a realistic point of view. Scorsese does not hide the blood. He does not hide way people die or where they may end up. He simply shows the gut-wrenching reality of the mob world as is. The most affective example of that realistic violence is Pesci's performance, which garnered him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1990. Tommy's character is a homicidal maniac, and a reminder of Cagney's performance in 'White Heat.' Pesci is horrifying to watch in action. From the opening scene where he stabs a body that is not quite dead, to his shooting of a young man named Spider who is slow to serve him a drink, the man is simply on fire. Pesci had a similar affect in 'Raging Bull.' As such, 'Goodfellas' is Pesci's 'Raging Bull.' A scene in 'Raging Bull' shows Pesci throwing a drink in a guy's face, then after a merciless beating, drags the guy out onto the street and repeatedly thrashes the man with a car door as the man's body lays half in the car and half outside it. The scene is horrific, but also enthralling. What is even more affective is Scorsese's use of music throughout the film. The time frame ranges from the 1960s to the late 1980s and the film's soundtrack plays like a time warp. The best use of music is Eric Clapton's 'Layla,' in which Scorsese plays the song's last four minutesa piano and guitar duo that masterfully captures the feeling for the events in the film. Ultimately, 'Goodfellas' is the equivalent of a mob-epic. Like the gangster pictures of the 1930s, there is also social commentaryit is the government that tries to crack down on these criminals, however, it is the police and other public sectors that are hand-in-hand with the moband little is ever done to change the situation. ****",10,0,0,13 March 2005
Cinderella Man," Uplifting Film Powered By Unconventional Story!
","Two years ago, during the summer of 2003, I was working at a movie theater in my home town. 'Seabiscuit' was playing and this particular showing was on a run-of-the-mill Wednesday night. As the show was breaking, I opened the door to the house and saw the ending and the audience applauding. The result was the same when I saw the film a week prior on a Sunday afternoon. The new film, 'Cinderella Man,' had the same effect on the audience the night I saw it. The movie is so inspiring and uplifting in the classic sense of Hollywood splendor, that one finds themselves moved to tears and cheering on the hero of the show. What makes this unique is the fact that this audience is in a movie theater. What we see on the screen is not live. Yet we feel transformed to Madison Square Garden during that amazing night in June of 1935 when James J. Braddock took on Max Baer for the Championship of the World. It is as close to the real thing as we can get these daysand what an experience it is at that. It is what makes going to the movies so magical. 'Cinderella Man' tells the story of once great boxer Jim Braddock played masterfully by Russell Crowe. Early on in his career, Braddock made lots of dough and was adored by family and fans. But after the stock market crash and during the Great Depression, his career goes down the tubes and his abilities dwindle as a fighter. He struggles to find work at the pier and to keep his family fed. It leads to desperate measures on the part of his son to stealing salami from a butcher, his wife sending their children to relatives because they cannot afford to take care of them, to Braddock having to beg for cash. After a time, Braddock's old manager Joe (Paul Giamatti) comes to him with an opportunity by chance to make some quick cash in the ring. SinceBraddock realizes the hardships he has faced, he takes the opportunity for exactly what it isan opportunity. To him, it is more than just a fight or something he loves; it is a chance to see Madison Square Garden again, a chance to hear the roar of the crowd. And a chance to show his children that he still has what it takes to be a champ. Braddock wins the fight and amazes the audience who barely remembered his existence. He generates a comeback and starts to win fights regardless of his age or condition. This is because his reasons for boxing have changed, 'This time around I know what I'm fightin' formilk!' He has a family and needs to support them. However, the chances become far more dangerous when Braddock is asked to fight against Max Bear, a boxer who killed two men in the ring with his power punches to the head. Regardless of the danger, Braddock agrees to go ahead with the fight, even against his wife's urges to get out of it. It all leads to a stirring finally that will leave the audience breathless and emotional.One of the film's most touching moments comes when Braddock realizes that his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) has sent their children away to relatives because they can no longer afford to take care of them. He is deeply upset because he has made a promise to his son that no matter how bad things would get, he would never send the children away. As a desperate measure, he goes to see his old bosses and asks for any money they can spare. He holds out his hat and most drop some coins or a few dollars in. We see Crowe's face at this point, his eyes welling up. You feel his humility and how pathetic his existence has become by begging for money. And yet, he is not a beggar. He simply has nothing left and it is easy to sympathize with him. There are excellent uses of cinematography in this picture. As the film opens, the camera shots are steady as we see Braddock as a winner in his early days, living in a nice home in New Jersey with plen ty of worldly possessions. Then, as we see Braddock and his family living in a slum apartment, the camera shots become shaky and convey the lack of stability in his life. Some great moments of editing occur during scenes where Braddock gets injured. There is a slow motion shot of the blow to the body. Then the screen goes white momentarily with an ex-ray shot of Braddock,conveying the severity of the pain. What truly makes 'Cinderella Man' go beyond the predictable aspect of an uplifting story is Braddock's merit for his comeback. He is no longer fighting with his passion for the sport or to gain a higher place in society. He fights so his children can eat and be brought up in a home with heat. What began as a man motivated by passion brought down by ability and circumstance, becomes a man motivated by the ability to exist and provide for his family. That, in and of itself, is the true greatness of this film. (***1/2 out of ****)",9,3,5,3 June 2005
