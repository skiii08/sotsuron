Resident Evil: Afterlife," Very educational and informative!
","I learned many useful things from this installment of the RE series that I had previously not been aware of.Apparently, stories and character development are no longer important to film making. Just explain who somebody is with a single line of dialogue and move on to the action.I also learned that, although she has no memory of herself and is left alone for months to survive the apocalypse, Claire Redfield insists on bathing and putting on makeup before entering any airplane for rescue.It was nice to be reminded that zombies are never overused and the fact that they are included in a movie never needs to be addressed. Just being there is now implied and no acknowledgement or explanation of their behavior is required. Zombies gonna zomb, apparently.I am so pleased that The Matrix invented bullet-time effects. Finally, action movies have distractions that can easily thwart an audience's questions of logic by using sheer confusion and stylish scenes that are accompanied by a rocking guitar track.I am now aware that once a person is again turned human by a CGI cut scene of internal microscopic interaction, that they can now withstand a headlong, fiery collision into the face of a mountain.Thankfully, I now know what a bastardized combination of Leatherface, Pinhead and Pyramid Head looks like.I am once again reminded that Hollywood no longer has anyone interested in creating anything original or memorable. Remakes, reboots, sequels and prequels draw the zombie hordes to the theaters.And finally, I learned the most important lesson of all. I learned that every problem can be solved with guns.",3,0,2,10 January 2012
