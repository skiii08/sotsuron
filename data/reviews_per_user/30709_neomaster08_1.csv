Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Terrible
",It was the most ignorant piece of crap i have ever seen. do not go to see this movie even if your life depended on it. it was the worst movie i have ever seen. if you liked this movie then you have no mind. the writer of this movie should stop making movies while hes behind. i have no idea how this utterly piece of crap actually made number one at the box office. it doesn't deserve that spot. watching a fat man going to the bathroom would have made a better movie storyline wise than this movie. Do not see this movie it was the worst the worst movie experience i have ever experienced. i have just seen it and i felt like walking out on this terrible terrible movie.,1,13,29,10 November 2006
