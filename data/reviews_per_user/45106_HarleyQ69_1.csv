The Avengers," Believe the hype
","I am an unapologetic fan girl. The very idea of Avengers with Joss directing was enough to send me to happy land and I am happy to say he lived up to it! First and foremost, Mark Ruffalo as Hulk owns that part. Hands down the only portrayal that has clicked on every single level. All talk of Norton should be left behind once and for all because as far as casting goes third time was a charm. The story moves fast without sacrificing the story lines or character development. Loki is an awesome awesome villain in this, and both Black Widow and Hawkeye's characters were really well fleshed out. And Joss Whedon was born to write for RDJ. Stay for the TWO post credit scenes. I can sum this movie up short and sweet. God bless you, Joss Whedon!",10,1,5,4 May 2012
