The Legend of Bagger Vance," Dull as a 3-day golf match
","A childish new-agey fable boring and predictable, full of clichés and frankly pathetic. Will Smith's charlatan is one of the most annoying creations I've seen on screen lately. Good old Jack Lemmon must have been so ashamed of it that he's out of the credits. So bad that not even the little boy is charming.",Null,4,10,5 January 2004
Insomnia," Surpasses the original
","Far more interesting than the norwegian original, Insomnia confirms Nolan as the best emerging director in the american cinema.A pair of key scenes as the jumping of drifting logs are original of the new version and the character developing surpasses the somehow unidimensional roles of the norwegian one, like the officer played by Hillary Swank and the hotel clerk with a dubious past.Al Pacino's character reaches in the remake a new dimension, not only because of the relationship with his partner in the light of the investigation that takes place over his activities, but also because of the perfect construction of his drama, that makes his sleep inability work both in a literal and methaphorical level.The audacious premise of creating the noirest of films in a place that never gets dark works as effectively as the solid formal narrative of `Memento'. Nolan pushes the limits once more here and maybe the fact that Insomnia inserts itself into very defined genre territory makes it even more outstanding in its achievement.",Null,0,0,11 March 2003
Alien," survival kitten
","The best thing in Alien is its naturalness. The way the crew talk, its spontaneity and casualness. They can be discussing a failure in a complex technological device in the ship, but nevertheless they do it smoking cigarettes and eating sandwiches, just as if they talk about the weather. When they press buttons one feels that they did it a million times before. They even play with the sliding doors to trap each other in order to be listened to. These circumstances makes Kane's death during a moment of> relaxed camaraderie so unforgettable and shocking. One is not prepared at all. No pomp, no memorable last words, just a funny comment about the quality of the food and there it goes. Like the two mechanics, Brett and Parker. One wonders what they are doing in such a mission, with their Hawaiian shirts and baseball caps, p****d off for working extra time or complaining about their low payments, as if they were in a factory. Just imagine the same characters in a bad script, wearing glasses and overalls, cutting off from the rest in the midst of trouble, challenging the others with their technical notions. They cannot stand a comparison. The Alien characters succeed in their improbability because they are not real; they are true. Alien is more a script achievement than a directorial one. The story is so well written and solid in its structure that it could probably been as good with any other director. One thinks that Scott is more at ease with more baroque material, like Blade Runner. So there's little of the director's world here, it's definitely writer Dan O'Bannon's territory instead, a reinvention of the American horror genre, minimalist and philosophical, a big budget with a `B' premise. Alien is not the best film ever made. It's not even the best of the saga (I consider `Aliens' a superior film). But one must admire the film's efficiency. Efficiency given solely by the characters, not always by what they say, but by the way they look at each other. These rules of the game are established right from the beginning, and are followed religiously thorough the rest of the film. There's nothing external altering this order, just as we hardly know anything about the world outside the ship. Alien's accomplishment is more in tune with films to-come as `The Thing' or `The Abyss'. Like the Nostromo ship, O'Bannon's story set voyage beyond the frontiers of the genre. Too bad that he didn't leave the irritating cat there.",Null,0,1,2 February 2004
Duck Soup," when comedy was Freedonia
","Duck Soup is the Marx Brothers best film because it's the only one in which they had the opportunity of working with a good director. And a craftsman like McCarey could easily take away any radio monologue or useless instrument playing for the sake of pure cinematic storytelling. Here they aren't the clowns helping a phony singing couple; they are the force (or Schopenhauerian Will) that moves Freedonia. Everything seems to be right in this film, from the memorable pompous musical numbers (`I think they think we'll go to war' and Firefly's assumption ceremony), to the slapstick moments at the peanut stand or the breaking in the house, a scene that concludes with the mirror scene that constitute one of the most abstract moments in film history.  The Marx' were never as anarchic and creative as in this film (check out the change of costumes between shots during the war scene) and it's sad that in their later films they sacrificed a lot of their talent to comfort the studio's establishment. However, the idea of a leader as Firefly ruling a nation has been proved often ever since; another example of life imitating film.",Null,0,2,21 May 2004
Duck You Sucker," Boooom!
","It is always interesting to see a weak film of one of the world's most honest directors, a fellow that knew his limitations and still provided one of the most original bodies of work in modern cinema. Leone's westerns are shot with the heart and are cut with his teeth. This long epic of dynamite blows, broken-english curses, glaring disconnected Irish flashbacks, zooming galore and close up of bare buttocks provides a wonderful acting duel between Coburn and Steiger, a sort of Quixotean duo of the Mexican revolution. Think of a similar kind of material polished by craftier hands and you get the contemporary and striking railway extravaganza `The Emperor of the North Pole' directed by Robert Aldrich.",Null,1,3,29 January 2004
The Last Samurai," What do you want from me????!!!
","This pompous, one-dimensioned, uninteresting, long and phony picture tries really hard to portrait `the real Japan'. Needless to say one single frame from any Mizoguchi film (sixty, seventy years old as it may be) is ten times worth than this banal reproduction, poor ensemble of local color and cliché. From the lifeless, mummified characters that seem to bring together  and in a lighter dose- the charlatanry of Morpheus from The Matrix and Karate Kid's Pat Morita, to the cheap plot devices and filmmaking (we see the sword fight and right afterwards the videoclip of the fight, a nicely learned lesson from Tarantino's school), Cruise's attempt to build a legendary figure embodied with Custer's bravura and Samurai's honor is anything but believable, rather a wannabee metaphor of some new age dubious doctrine. Cruise character is tormented by memories of his past as a women and children's murder; this issue never nails on the audience as in the case of `Unforgiven', where the character's inner demons must be confronted and defeated by paying a hell of a prize. In fact it is precisely Eastwood's humanity what constitutes his heroism. On the other hand, Cruise's experience `on the other side' is more of a tourist kind compared with Harrison Ford's life with the Amish in `Witness' or Gene Kelly's magic discovery of `Brigadoon', two classic examples of imperfect individuals transcending themselves after coping with a world that is not their own. Bad as a film could be, there's always one or two scenes worth remembering. Not in this one. Let's give credit to the title and hope it'll be the last.",Null,0,1,3 February 2004
