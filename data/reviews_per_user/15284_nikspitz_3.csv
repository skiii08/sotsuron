Black Swan," A masterful study of the shadow
","This is exceptional film making that, like most really well put together film, supports ever deepening appreciation on subsequent viewings.After early suggestions of shadows at play, from a well paced, seemingly innocuous start, the film takes several rapid left turns, punctuated with passionate and erotic twists, drawing us deeper into a squirm-in-your-seat psychological thriller - not a genre or feeling I myself seek or generally enjoy - but this is seductive filming, building steadily to a powerful and sublime climax that is richly satisfying.The film is evocatively and masterfully shot, full of subtlety, richness and depth. The supporting cast are absolutely flawless in their roles. Portman nails the part - is the part - embodying it metaphorically, psychologically, and in some sense literally. The dance itself is effective, though not, per se the focus of the film, so much as the unnerving character study and exploration of the shadow we all posses, or possesses us, and ultimately, the power in transformation.Powerful lighting, direction, edgy score - the overall gestalt is a film where the sum creates something greater than its component parts - the alchemical art of film making.",10,1,3,11 February 2016
The Fountain," Extraordinary visual beauty and vision
","After poor reviews and short run time at the theater, one might not expect much (the best way to see a film of course). Having read something of the use of organic liquid processes (light, oil, water) instead of CGI for cosmic screen effects though, I was curious.It turned out to be a film of such extraordinary visual beauty, power and vision, resonant of our deepest earthly yearnings - love, conquest, transcendence and immortality. The fact that it's beauty and vision is lost on so many reviewers is a reminder that when mainstreamed so much high budget, Hollywood formula film, we tend to become insensitive and impatient so as to completely miss the deep pleasure of a rare and lasting treat.",10,0,0,11 February 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," visceral, avante-garde, original - cinema at its best
","Captivating from first frame to last, visceral performances, from Michael Keaton and Emma Stone in particular, avant-garde inventive cinematography and score, surreal yet vivid, pithy, original, and very New York.That's really all that need be said - no point blathering about the thin veil of separation between stage and life, the search for meaning, death of the ego, validation, love...all aptly distilled in the epigraph:'And did you get what you wanted from this life, even so?' 'I did' 'And what did you want?' 'To call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on the earth'{Raymond Carver, Late fragment}",10,1,3,12 February 2016
