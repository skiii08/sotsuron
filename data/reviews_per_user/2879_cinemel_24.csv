The Blair Witch Project," Eerie, but not very scary tale
","'The Blair Witch Project' is not the scariest movie. It isn't even scary. It is a bit eerie. However, it is so crudely filmed ($100,000 budget) to reflect its feeling as a student documentary film, that it works against itself. So much of the screen time is devoted to a black screen or shots of grass and trees shot with hand-held cameras, that it is just annoying. The most atmospheric thing about the film is the soundtrack composed of dialog and weird sound effects. The hype around the film's origins and promotion on the Internet is just that, hype. The movie just doesn't have much entertainment value. It is just a curiosity, and audiences are flocking to it just for that reason. I suspect they will be as disappointed as I was. The writers/directors, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, gave the gist of each day's shooting to the three actors who use their own names for their characters. They then just took the two cameras, one 16mm black & white and an RCA video camera, and improvised the dialog and action to fit the generalized plot of the day. The actors should be given screenplay credit. Their performances are natural and in its final sequence amazingly real. All of the film's creators will probably go on to more expensive productions in the near future. Possibly then their creativity and talent will be more fully realized.",1,0,1,10 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Menace is Star Wars Deluxe
","How does one begin to write about a film that has been hyped to the hilt and anticipated like the Second Coming! Surprise. It's better than I expected from the reviews of the early professional critics. It has flaws that do not affect the basic entertainment value of what has become a cinema institution.George Lucas has fashioned a rousing adventure yarn that will appeal to people of all ages and, of course, aficionados of the original trilogy. Viewing 'Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace' at its first regular showing at the UA Syosset Theater with these die-hard Star Wars fans was an 'experience'. The crowd was permitted to enter the theater at 11PM, an hour before its 12 midnight screening. The electricity in the air was palpable. When the 20th Century-Fox logo and Lucasfilm Ltd. appeared on the giant screen in magnificent digital sound, the audience cheered. They had waited over 15 years since the last of the original trilogy. After the initial euphoria of the introductory narrative, you could hear a pin drop. There were flashes of applause as some of the characters of the earlier films made their entrances or cameo appearance.Lucas has begun the tale of the young Darth Vader (nee Anakin Skywalker) with just subtle hints of the evil which will overtake him in the two films to follow. He is portrayed by the pre-teen Jake Lloyd in a manner that will charm the pants off little boys of all ages. His mentor is Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) who recognizes his special affinity for the Force. The young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) has more of a supporting role in this section of the tale, but his turn will come in the subsequent films. Natalie Portman is the Queen Amidala of Naboo. Lucas' genius in choosing names for his characters and exotic planets and places hasn't waned. All of the other robots and creatures you knew and loved are here (C-3PO, R2-D2, Yoda, Jabba-the Hutt). One new creature/character (Jar Jar Binks) has a humanoid body but a strange head with dangling, floppy ears, eyes protruding high on his head, and a long, slim tongue. This character has a weird speech pattern, somewhat Caribbean in character, which is difficult to understand. It gets better as the story progresses because Jar Jar is the comic relief as C3-PO was in the earlier films.It has come to the point where the special effects wizards can create on the screen virtually anything that the imaginative storyteller can conjure up in his mind. The production design is intricate and eye-popping. Each planet reveals its own wonders. Naboo is lush and green, looking a little like the ancient Rome of Cleopatra (1963). Coruscant, the city/planet, is a bustling megalopolis without the blight of most urban centers. Tatooine is the desert planet that figured in the first film. Only this time, it is more richly populated by humans, robots and creatures as was hinted in the Special Edition Lucas released a couple of years ago. On Tatooine the action centerpiece of the film, a pulse-quickening pod race, pits the youthful Anakin against the evil Sebulba. This race is remarkable reminiscent of the chariot race in Ben-Hur (1959). Even the arena where all the screaming fans watch resembles the one in that Roman epic. Lucas is not afraid to borrow, but it's always with a new twist.John Williams's musical score complements the action perfectly. His superb choral sequence in the climactic light saber duel sweeps the action along,. The cutting from the battle on the Naboo's surface, to Anakin's initiation into spacecraft warfare and back to the duel reminds one of the genius that D.W. Griffith used in his climactic montage of suspense and action in the silent 'Intolerance'.This film is not for everyone. The audience I saw it with was 95% male. The romantic element will probably be an emphasis of the next episode. Those who are not familiar with the first three films will not really appreciate the many allusions to those stories. The acting may not be up to the quality of serious drama, but that's not what this film is about. See it in the spirit Lucas made it, a Saturday morning serial. I can hardy wait for the next episode: Episode II-The Clone Wars? Meanwhile, I'll have to be satisfied seeing this edition a couple of more times.",8,1,1,19 May 1999
Erin Brockovich," Fine entertaining drama with humor, romance and poignancy
","Julia Roberts lights up the screen in this basically serious drama directed by Steven Soderbergh. Roberts is a single mother,'Erin Brockovich', struggling to raise three children of two failed marriages. She finally gets a job working for attorney Ed Masry, winningly portrayed by Albert Finney, and gets involved in a case involving a Love Canal-type suit with many plaintiffs and a Goliath-like defendant (Pacific Gas & Electric). The utility company is allegedly guilty of polluting the water in the plaintiffs' town causing a variety of diseases and tragedy and, of course, trying to cover it up.Soderbergh has directed this piece with a fine combination of humor, romance and poignancy. The film is peppered with salty dialogue, an able supporting cast (Aaron Eckhart, Conchita Farrell, & Marge Helgenberger) and a satisfying ending. The filmmakers have succeeded in creating a movie that is both entertaining, enlightening and even has a social message.",Null,1,1,8 March 2000
Meet the Parents," Hilarious comedy will keep you in stitches.
","Robert DeNiro is developing into quite an entertaining comedic actor. In his latest comic opus, which he also produced, he is the future father-in-law of Greg Focker (Ben Stiller).  Greg's girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo) has brought him home to `Meet the Parents'. From the moment he drives up to the front door nothing goes right. Jay Roach (Austin Powers) has ably directed his actors getting just the right combination of humor and character without being too slapsticky.Unfortunately, the trailer gives away many of the film's best gags. However, the characters are likeable so that you sympathize with their plight. Blythe Danner is the future mother-in-law and isn't given much to do. Of course, the end of the story seems to lead to the possible sequel, `Meet the Fockers,' Greg's parents. Who would be better to play them than Ben Stiller's own folks, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. Hire them, quick!",6,0,0,4 October 2000
Shakespeare in Love," Shakespeare for everyone!
","For two sublime hours the viewer is transported to the Elizabethan era where women are forbidden to act and playwrights are the struggling authors of their day. The cast is a film marketer's dream. You have Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Afleck, and Joseph Fiennes for the youngsters.You have Geoffrey Rush and Judi Dench for more mature viewers. For all viewers you have a beautiful bittersweet love story which you wish had, but never took place. It tries to answer the questions of how William Shakespeare came up with the classic love story, 'Romeo and Juliet.' According to screenwriters Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, the Bard of Stratford-on-Avon came up with very little of it himself, borrowing freely from many local acquaintances and Christopher Marlowe himself.Gwyneth Paltrow plays the theatre-loving Viola who pines for love and the chance to be an actress, in a time when all roles are portrayed by men. Joseph Fiennes is the playwright, Will Shapkespeare, suffering from writer's block and searching for the muse to spark his latest effort. Of course, he falls for Viola who also auditions for the role of Romeo in his current production (but he doesn't know he's a she.) The plot thickens and is spiced by the wonderful iambic pentameter of 'Romeo and Juliet'. There is just enough of the original play which will be familiar, but not too much so that younger audiences will be bored or annoyed.The performances by the cast are fine all around. Miss Paltrow is becoming a star with a charisma that lights up the wide Panavision-sized screen. Joseph Fiennes, brother to Ralph, adds to the romantic chemistry and makes you believe he is the young  William Shakespeare. The cameo appearance of Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth is welcome and interesting in light of the concurrent film of her story, 'Elizabeth', portrayed by Cate Blanchett during her earlier years.The physical production is lush with realistic reproductions of the theatres of the time, as well as costumes and make-up both lovely and humorous. Special mention should be made of the fine  background score by Stephen Warbeck. I actually stayed until the last final credit scrolled by to hear every note in spectacular digital sound.Shakespeare in Love has a little for everyone, humor, romance, fine language, good acting, and something often rare in today's films, a good old-fashioned story.",8,0,0,17 January 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Force Strikes Back
","The fifth in the Star Wars galaxy blasts into that faraway long ago continuing the tale of the Skywalker clan. The Force strikes back in the extreme. In this the 2nd prequel we are introduced to Anakin Skywalker, the future Darth Vader, in his young adult incarnation. His romance with the lovely former queen and present Senator Padme Amidala and his journey to the dark side improve on the juvenile shenanigans of the child in Episode I. The silliness of Jar Jar Binks in the earlier film is also kept to a minimum here.George Lucas, always pushing the envelope technologically, again does so here, filming the entire movie digitally. Visually the images are sumptuous and eye filling. The variety of environments on different planets keeps the viewer engaged and delighted. The story returns to the city planet of Coruscant, the desert planet of Tatooine, and introduces a rain-swept planet where the clones of the title are being grown.Here Lucas begins filling in the gaps leading up to the 4th episode, the original Star Wars film. The relationship between R2D2 and C3PO develops humorously. We find out the genesis of the character, Boba Fett. However, the high points of any space adventure are its action sequences. These are thrilling and more frequent than in the Phantom Menace. A fantastic chase through the skyscrapers of Coruscant gives you the feeling that these characters are really zooming and swooping between the canyons of this throbbing metropolis. A later sequence in an arena that dwarfs those in Gladiator or Ben-Hur pits our protagonists against fearsome creatures which are indescribably ugly and vicious. A final light saber duel brings the audience to applause because. . .no, I won't spoil it.John Williams score is an integral part of Star Wars lore. Here he interweaves themes introduced in the first three films, Leia's theme, the Imperial March and others, with the new music for this opus. In particular, the love theme for Anakin and Padme is moving and effective. It really supports the actors' tentative performances during these scenes. Lucas has never been much of an actor's director. It's in this one area that he has left his two main characters out in the cold. Han Solo and Princess Leia had a perfect chemistry that is not as natural here. Ewan McGregor is evolving smoothly into Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan. Yoda is now completely in the CGI domain. Samuel L. Jackson has more to do than in Menace and always adds that something special to his roles. He even gets to wield a light saber. Wonderful Christopher Lee is the evil Count Dooku. Interesting that his counterpart in so many Hammer horror films, Peter Cushing, was a villain in the first Star Wars film.Star Wars fans will not be disappointed. The romance in the tale will also make the tale much more accessible to women. The film builds to a rousing conclusion making the audience wish that they would not have to wait another three years to find out what events will bring the saga full circle.",7,0,0,17 May 2002
Notting Hill," Charming romantic comedy
","Julia Roberts smile lights up the screen as she portrays an actress not unlike herself. She drops into Hugh Grant's Travel Book-only book store and the sparks begin to fly. Grant's family and friends are there for comedic and moral support. The story moves right along, and just when you might be getting bored, Roberts smiles, or Grant gets that hurt puppy dog look in his eyes. That's the kind of film this is. A pleasant romance like they used to make will be a fine alternative to the action/adventures filling up the summer screens. You could do a lot worse.",7,0,0,21 May 1999
American Pie," Adolescent, but funny teenage comedy
","Here it comes: The gross out movie of the summer of '99. You'll laugh yourself silly, but you'll feel a little guilty thinking that you laughed at such infantile adolescent jokes. In 'American Pie', Paul Weitz has directed  a group of likeable young actors portraying  seniors in high school. They are in pursuit of the 'Holy Grail', losing their virginity by the night of the Senior Prom. Yes, that's it. You can predict the rest of it after the first five minutes. The masturbation jokes are there. You'll laugh at them. Not that there's anything wrong with that. The embarrassing teenage pranks involving sex and bodily functions are as ridiculous as ever, just a little more over the line than you've seen before. But pushing the envelope in these types of comedies is what it's all about.  So check your brains at the door and have a good laugh.",7,0,0,6 July 1999
U-571," Rousing, exciting and loud WWII submarine adventure
","Matthew McConaughey stars in this rousing submarine adventure, `U-571'. Using state of the art special effects and multi-channel surround sound, Jonathan Mostow directs the viewer into the World War II claustrophobia of American and German underwater battleships. McConaughy portrays the first officer of a U.S. sub that has been given the mission of capturing the German coding machine named `Enigma'. In the process of accomplishing their mission, he and his cohorts are stranded on a wounded German U-boat and are under attack from above by a German battleship. Harvey Keitel is his second in command. This is an unusually heroic role for Keitel who usually plays in quirky independent films. Bill Paxton as the American sub skipper, Jon Bon Jovi, and Erik Palladino (of TV's `ER') also acquit themselves well.Mostrow uses the wide Panavision screen to draw the audience into this scary world where depth charges are dropped from above exploding loudly all around them (and us). These Dolby Digital explosions are deftly contrasted to the deadly silences. These are punctuated by the periodic sonar `pings' and the creaking of the aged sub as she plummets the ocean to levels where the crushing weight of the water above threatens to squash the steel like a weak tin can.
Like many World War II films of the past, `U-571' is a bit weak on characterization. However, that's not what this film is about. The action and adventure are the reason for this film, and here, the filmmakers have delivered!",Null,0,1,23 April 2000
American Beauty," Entertaining comedy/drama beautifully photographed and performed
","Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, the husband/father in a dysfunctional family, in Sam Mendes latest film, `American Beauty'. His wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is a real estate agent, and his teenage daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), is suffering from typical adolescent angst. Into their lives come three people who will change their lives and upset the precarious balance of everyday existence. Lester becomes obsessed with Jane's beautiful cheerleader best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). Carolyn falls for Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher), a competing real estate agent, whom she lusts after and idolizes professionally. Jane meets Ricky (the excellent Wes Bentley) who conveniently lives next door and furtively photographs her at every opportunity. Of course this is all a prescription for disaster. Alan Ball, screenwriter, has devised some wickedly funny daydream sequences for his characters.  These are all stunningly photographed by Conrad Hall and scored by Thomas Newman. There is a passionate synergy of all these parts sweeping these characters toward the tragic conclusion which is more than hinted at in Lester's ongoing narration. This is only weakened slightly by a rather predictable last half-hour. Spacey continues to add to a gallery of extraordinary performances (Usual Suspect, L.A. Confidential). Beautiful Annette Bening displays her growing range as a mature actress. Both Thora Birch (Now and Then) and Wes Bentley give career-making performances. Chis Cooper and Allison Janey, as the next door neighbors who are even more dysfunctional that the Burnhams, also etch fine portrayals. This comedy/drama will probably be on many `best lists' and hopefully won't be forgotten at award time. All creative hands here have brought an entertaining tale to brighten the fall film season.",9,0,0,5 October 1999
The Exorcist," A horror classic has its soundtrack and visuals digitally spruced up.
","A new digitally spruced up version of the classic film, `The Exorcist', has been released to theaters. The soundtrack now has subtle and loud and scary sound effects. The visuals contain various subliminal Devilish faces flashed quickly at certain points and 11 minutes of material deleted from the final cut, but included in similar form on the currently available DVD release in a superb documentary. Otherwise, the tale still packs quite a wallop. Its impact is certainly greater on the big theater screen. The key to the film's class is the perfect performance of Max Von Sydow in the title roll. The iconic scene where he arrives at the home of the possessed Regan still sends chills up the spine. The gross out scenes are still there (pea soup, head twirling and rattling bed). In addition there is the cut cult scene of Regan scrambling spider-like down the stairs drooling blood. And, on it goes. If you've never seen it in a theater it is worthwhile. If you like a good scare and don't mind the gore, it's not as disgusting as some of the more recent slice and dice epics. Be sure to rent the DVD to hear William Friedkin (director) and William Peter Blatty (writer, also novel) heatedly discussing the deleted scenes which have been added to this version. The new ending slightly blunts the coldness of the original, but the optimism of the new millennium gives the added scene a definite resonance.",8,0,1,27 September 2000
Remember the Titans," Wonderfully rousing drama the whole family can enjoy.
","Boaz Yakin has directed a rousing true story drama. Not being a football fan, I entered planning to take a nap. However, this uplifting tale of the dawn of integration in Alexandria, Virginia in the early 70's, draws the viewer in and doesn't let up for a moment. Denzel Washington stars as Coach Boone who is brought in replacing Coach Yoast (winningly portrayed by Will Patton), previous coach of the all white T.C. Williams High School football team.  The two local high schools are being integrated and so is the football team. Boone, not only has to contend with the divisiveness of the local community, but with the job of creating a black and white team that will work together to play and win on the football field.  Washington's Knute Rockne-like orations to the teens are surprisingly straightforward and sincerely delivered. During a boot camp training period he gradually gets the boys to jell as a team and, more surprisingly as friends and equals off the field. In particular, a speech to the boys on the grounds of the Gettysburg cemetery is particularly moving. This carries over to the high school population in general when the team comes home, and helps the community at large deal with integration. Performances are top notch all around. Fine use is made of period music and the expanse of the wide screen. Even wise use of surround sound brings the audience right into the thick of the battles on the gridiron. Best of all, the film is rated PG. As beautifully written by Gregory Allen Howard, use of coarse language is at an absolute minimum, and it doesn't adversely affect the film one bit. All in all, this is so far the best of the fall releases; one the whole family can see and enjoy.",Null,0,1,27 September 2000
Men in Black II," Excellent special effects wasted on anemic sequel
","Tommie Lee Jones and Will Smith reprise their roles as Agents J & K in Barry Sonnenfeld's sequel to the enormously successful Men in Black of 5 years ago. This time their roles are reversed. Will Smith portrays the veteran anti-alien agent and Jones is the naive postal worker whose knowledge of aliens has been neuralized (wiped out). When the earth is threatened by Lara Flynn Boyle (as the new alien villain), Jones is brought out of 'retirement' and restored to partnership with Smith. It sounds like it should work, but it is only fitfully amusing and not very exciting. However, the special effects are even more elaborate than in the original, but it isn't enough. The only thing that saves the film is a canine alien agent who has a leaning towards singing songs like 'I Will Survive' and 'Who let the dogs out?' He steals the show from the stars. The movie itself is mercifully short (88 minutes, with about 10 minutes of credits making the body of the film only 78-80 min. long, or short, as it were). So if you liked the original, you might enjoy this one. It just isn't fresh or original, just a money-making rehash.",4,0,0,21 July 2002
The Insider," Imaginatively filmed docu-drama with solid performances
","A car rides along passing a cemetery, the crosses strobe eerily across the Panavision screen. A row of cars drive almost solemnly as in a cortege toward a courthouse where a deposition will be given. Another vehicle twists through the streets of a Middle Eastern city with a destination rife with danger. These are just three of the images Michael Mann presents us with in his latest film, `The Insiders'. It's this constant parade of resonant scenes  that transform what could have been a run-of-the-mill TV movie of the week into one of most incisive and burning dramas to come from a major studio since `All the President's Men'.The actors portray a cast of real-life  people, never imitating, but subtly communicating their innermost feelings and conflicts. Al Pacino is Lowell Berman, segment producer of 60 Minutes, preparing an interview with Jeffrey Wigand, recently fired executive of the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co. Pacino has his best role in years. Here there is none of the scenery chewing he has been somewhat guilty of in `Devil's Advocate' and `Scarface'. This stunning expose of the tobacco industry will rock the lives of Wigand and his family, and change the public's view of Big Tobacco forever. Russell Crowe (as Wigand) delivers another award worthy performance as he tortures himself as to whether or not he should reveal the stunning facts he has been privy to as part of his job. Crowe actually gained weight to realistically resemble Wigand.  Christopher Plummer is perfect as Mike Wallace in a not altogether pleasant portrayal of this TV icon. Plummer is sure to garner  supporting actor nominations for this role. Description of the plot cannot do justice to Mann's passionate rendering of this story. He has delivered a motion picture for adults without the violence, car chases and explosions we are used to. And yet, the undercurrent of danger remains lurking around every corner threatening the lives of the people who just want to do what is right.",6,0,1,15 November 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," A film for the ages
","In March, 1999, one of the masters of the cinema died. Stanley Kubrick will be principally remembered for his science fiction classic, '2001: A Space Odyssey.' Kubrick's impact on motion pictures will be felt for years to come. I will never forget seeing '2001' for the first time in 1968 on the giant Cinerama screen in New York. The unbelievable use of music and sound effects emanating from all around the theater was mind blowing. The special effects have not been really improved upon very much, 'Star Wars:The Phantom Menace,' not withstanding, and Kubrick didn't have the later advances of computer controlled cameras and digital effects. The amazing thing is he devised most of the special effects himself. It didn't matter that some of the plot was confusing. The idea was to get the moviegoer to think and talk about the meaning of it all. What film of today spurs its audience on to ruminate about the meaning of life, our place in the universe, and the future of the human race. Most of Kubrick's films had much more to say than their surface entertainment value.When it was announced that '2001' was going to be shown on network television for the first time, the film was shown for a limited run on the giant Cinerama screen at the UA Syosset Cinema on Long Island. I went to see it because I knew it would be a long time before it would be shown in its original version as it was meant to be seen. Now it is relegated to video. Make sure to see a letterboxed (widescreen) version. MGM/UA has a new version on DVD with a few extras. The laserdisc incarnations on Criterion and MGM/UA also have decent supplements. Don't miss this classic if you haven't seen it. If you have, watch it with a friend who has never seen it,just to watch his/her reactions. then talk about it. Most of today's films can be summed up briefly. Hours can be spent discussing '2001'. It is hard to believe Kubrick is gone. But his film legacy remains to entertain (even 'Eyes Wide Shut') and enrich us long past 2001.",10,1,3,3 November 1999
Singin' in the Rain," The dancingest, funniest musical of Hollywood's golden age.
","Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen have produced the best musical written directly for the screen. They have used the period in film history during the transition to sound movies and embroidered it with the wonderful songbook of Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown. The icing on the cake, of course is the choreography of Kelly and Donen. From the first moment, the movie takes flight as Kelly relates the tale of his rise as a silent film star with his sidekick, the incomparable Donald O'Connor. Watch the flying feet of O'Connor and Kelly in the 'Fit as a Fiddle' number. It doesn't get much better than this. Everyone is familiar with the classic 'Singin' in the Rain' sequence. Donald O'Connor's hysterical 'Make 'em Laugh' number is probably the funniest musical three minutes on film. Even the Broadway Ballet is a kaleidoscope of color and movement, with a minimum of the highbrow balletic choreography found in the later 'An American in Paris.'What makes 'Singin'' such an entertaining classic is its superb integration of comedy and music. Jean Hagen gives the performance of her life as the vocally challenged silent film star, Lena Lamont. Every scene she's in is a comic gem. Her 'fingernails on a blackboard' voice and massacre of the English language make her a figure of ridicule. However, in the end when she finally gets her comeuppance, one can't help feeling a little sorry for her.This delightful film has been given its due on video. On VHS it can be purchased with the complete remastered soundtrack on CD. The laserdisc versions include one with commentary by film historian Ronald Haver (Criterion) and the film-only version from MGM/UA Home Video with a restored Dolby Digital stereo soundtrack., Last,but not least,is a masterful rendering on DVD with, unfortunately, no supplementary material to speak of.This is truly a film for all time that can be watched just for its entertainment value and studied as probably the apex of the Hollywood musical in its Golden Age.",10,78,108,25 January 1999
The Red Violin," A musical feast for the eyes, ears and heart.
","Years ago there was a type of film which followed a particular item through the years as it passed from owner to owner ('The Yellow Rolls Royce'). Francois Girard has directed and written (with Don McKellar) a beautiful drama detailing the life of a red violin from its manufacture in the late 17th century through its sale at an auction in the present.Samuel L. Jackson portrays Charles Morritz, an antique violin authenticator. This auction is the framing device for the rest of the film. The tale flashes back to the tale of Nicolo Bussotti, a fictional violin maker. He is planning to give it to his unborn child. His pregnant wife (Irene Grazioli) goes to an old woman fortune teller who proceeds to relate some of the future of the Bussotis and other owners of the instrument.The violin continues on through the years coming into the possession of an orphan (Christoph Koncz). It then is owned by a virtuoso soloist (Jason Flemyng) who gets his inspiration by playing it during love-making with the lovely Greta Scacchi. The instrument passes across the ocean to China where Xiang Pei (Sylvia Chang) is caught in the middle of the cultural revolution. Finally, as a valuable antique, it is brought up for auction in the film's final sequence.This cursory summary cannot do justice to the lush beauty of this film. Joshua Bell plays the violin on the soundtrack to a fine score by John Corigliano (CD on Sony Classical). At an early screening Bell explain that the children in the orphanage are actually violinists. Bell's hands are also shown in other scenes as the instrument is played. The movie cost only $9 million but the production has an epic feel to it. McKellar explained that this is accomplished by lavishing the expense on one elaborate scene in each vignette. It definitely works.Girard has fashioned a wonderful story that probably should have been saved for the fall season. It has award winner written all over it. Especially in the areas of costumes, scenic design and music. It's a feast for the eyes and ears.",Null,1,1,9 June 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A fitting finale to a classic career
","The final film of director, Stanley Kubrick, has finally been released to theaters. It is a fine finale to a career of classic filmmaking. Although Kubrick has been accused of creating films that were cold and hard with characters to match, 'Eyes Wide Shut', adapted from a novel by Arthur Schnitzler, introduces us to his two major characters as they are preparing for a gala Christmas party given by their friend. Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise) and Alice Hartford (Nicole Kidman) live a privileged existence in the posh circles of  Manhattan. Their lush apartment is filled with all the accouterments of such a life. As they dress for the party, their demeanor and oral responses to one another subtly reveal the relationship they have in their nine-year-old marriage. At the party itself we meet their host (Sidney Pollack). Here the couple each get involved in a flirtation, she with a Hungarian Lothario, and he with two lovely young models. This is just the beginning of their descent into the world of sexual obsession and fantasy.Kubrick uses his camera as the voyeuristic eye of the audience, never really being clear as to whether certain scenes are real or fantasy. Bunuel did this in his classic French film, 'Belle DuJour'.  Except for a series of expository scenes relating the everyday routines of the husband at work and his wife at home, the rest of the film is sort of a fever dream drifting along deeper and deeper into the vortex of sex and violence that is a combination of their own obsessions and outside events beyond their control.The rumors that have followed the three-year gestation of this movie are generally untrue. Although the film is about sex, curiously, it is not particularly erotic. The famous orgy, which occurs about two-thirds through the film (2 hours 40 minutes long), is slightly muted by the digital insertion of figures that obscure certain body parts and motions deemed unacceptable to the ratings board. Professional critics were shown both versions, but generally agreed that the effect was the same in both versions. Critic Roger Ebert suggested that both versions be exhibited in different theaters. The un-cut version will be shown in Europe. Hopefully, the American audience will see the original cut in its video incarnation next year.Kubrick once said when asked what the ending of the classic, '2001: A Space Odyssey', meant, that he wanted the audience to bring something of themselves to his films. Therefore, he would not reveal any concrete answer. He said that the reason for the Mona Lisa's smile is part of her mystery. She would lose some of her appeal if DaVinci said that she was smiling because she is thinking of her lover. One error he makes in this film is toward the end he has the Sidney Pollack character give some sort of objective explanation of what has occurred. One could assume he was trying to give in to those who complained about the ambiguity of some of his other films. Hitchcock made a similar mistake in the psychiatrist's explanation of Norman Bates' condition at the end of 'Psycho'. Even this compromise does not materially flaw an otherwise distinct vision.Cruise and Kidman both give performances of which they can be proud. Kubrick's perfectionism is there on the screen. Kidman, in particular has a moving monologue in which she emotionally reveals to her husband, a fantasy she had years ago, which precipitates the rest of action in the film. Unfortunately, her character disappears for much of the remaining film, relegating her role to one basically supporting in nature.The film was completely filmed in England on sets, except for a couple of establishing shots of New York and several long shots of taxis on the streets of Manhattan. New Yorkers will recognize these street scenes as unreal. However, possibly, Kubrick wanted these sets to have a certain surreal ambiance. The musical score also adds effectively to sweep the audience along in what is a series of long scenes of extended dialogue.

","James Cameron's record-breaking epic `Titanic' yesterday sailed into stores in the first DVD edition. Paramount has done an outstanding job of bringing the pictorial and auditory splendor of this film to its latest video incarnation. Watching this story unfold after about a year reminds one of what a cinematic masterpiece it is. Cameron has used many of the tried and true movie conventions to great effect.  Slow motion enhances the lovers' flight through the engine rooms, using the glow of the furnaces to foreshadow the romantic scene to come and the ensuing tragic events.  Instead of constantly bombarding the viewer with a blaring soundtrack, in the sequence just before the ship finally sinks, the director uses the spare violins playing  `Near My God to Thee' as the Captain, the architect and other characters near their approaching doom. The sound design also includes some extremely effective use of surround sound as Rose (Kate Winslet) searches the bowels of the ship for Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio). The creaks of the near-collapsing hull of the ship envelop the viewer as does the sometimes soaring and sometimes-quiet musical score of composer, James Newton Howard.Performances are impassioned all around. Kathy Bates is both humorous as she dresses DiCaprio and touching as she observes the foundering ship in its final moments. Francis Fisher portrays Rose's selfish mother in such a way that even though she is selfish and bigoted, you somehow understand her. When she laces up Roses corset and explains her reasons for desiring a marriage for wealth rather than love, she holds a mirror up to the society of class distinctions that would be disappearing with the sinking of the ship. Eric Braeden has too few scenes as John Jacob Astor. However, he is perfect in projecting that image of new American wealth and class. Surely many of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. (In the excellent CD-ROM, `James Cameron's Titanic Explorer', Astor searches frantically for his dog as the sea engulfs the ship.) Victor Garber is most sympathetic as Titanic's architect. His final moments setting a clock as he awaits the inevitable is memorable. Bernard Hill is the Titanic's Captain Smith. Hill imbues this oft portrayed character with a subtlety so you sense his frustration as he realizes that his hands are tied as the ship sinks from under him. In a  scene with a steerage class mother who asks him where she must  go to a lifeboat he just barely shrugs and turns away from her. Jonathan Hyde is the steamship line's representative and a major heavy in his insistence that the ship break speed records and his quiet slinking on to a lifeboat to save his own neck. Incidentally, he lived the rest of his life in shame and seclusion. Of course, the tale is carried along by the expert thesping of DiCaprio and Winslet as the star-crossed lovers. Their travels throughout the length and breadth of the magnificent expanse of ocean liner give the viewer a perfect sense of the luxury and size of Titanic. Although their characters are fictional they bring them gloriously to life, so that in the end one really cares whether they live or die.One hopes that Cameron will, in the future, release a Collector's Deluxe edition including deleted scenes and a detailed `making of' feature giving the digital effects crew a chance to show how some of the fantastic special effects made everything seem so real. What made the effects so special is that they were unnoticeable. Cameron has made a film for the ages. It has earned all of the many awards it has won. Its place as a classic will only be realized with the passage of time. However, its records as the most popular American film to date will probably not be broken for many years to come.",9,1,2,1 September 1999
The Waterboy," Unbelievably unfunny
","After sitting in a theatre of pre-teens and teens for almost two hours, I felt very much out of the loop. The audience was laughing at this atrocity. I think I chuckled twice. Adam Sandler definitely has talent as demonstrated on Saturday Night Live. His co-star, the marvelous Kathy Bates, also is enormously talented. How could she get mixed up in this? The movie is competently photographed and has an involving soundtrack, but humor, almost nil.",1,4,10,6 April 1999
Ben-Hur," Classic epic film only improves with age.
","When we imagine the epic film as a genre, 3 films immediately come to mind: The Ten Commandments, Spartacus and Ben-Hur. Of the three, Ben-Hur is probably the most honored. It won 11 Oscars including Best Picture, Actor (Heston), Supporting Actor (Hugh Griffith), and Director (William Wyler). The only Oscar it didn't win was for Screenplay (Karl Tunberg). The reason probably had something to do with the fact that several other authors, including Gore Vidal, had a hand in its re-writing. What makes Ben-Hur a great epic? First, the sweep of its locations and settings. Giant sets were constructed on the grounds of the great Cinecitta Studios in Rome. State of the art special effects enhanced the two great action sequences (the sea battle and the chariot race). Next, the larger than life performances of the principals brought to life these imagined characters of novelist, Lew Wallace. Stephen Boyd is perfect as the Roman centurion, Messala, who has returned to Judea (Israel) to assume his place as military leader anxious to suppress the Hebrews who are ruled by the Roman Empire. Boyd never again had a role to equal this. He was a fine match for Heston who embodies the princely Ben-Hur whose friend he was in their childhood. It is their enmity that lies at the core of this tale. The underlying story of Christ parallels the journey of Ben-Hur intersecting at two crucial points in the film. Wyler wisely does not show the face of Christ. Instead, he shows people's reactions to him. In one scene, a Roman soldier is trying to prevent Ben-Hur (now a prisoner) from drinking water. After Christ lets him drink the soldier tries to stop him (`I said no water for him'). His reaction to the hidden face of Christ is worth a thousand words. No discussion of Ben-Hur would be complete without mentioning the towering musical score composed and conducted by Miklos Rozsa (Academy Award).  Finally, it is many qualities such as this that give Ben-Hur the stature of more than just a sword and sandal epic, but transform it into a personal drama. Its characters are living, breathing beings swept into events that make for exciting cinema. Jack Hawkins is fine as the Roman general whose life Ben-Hur saves (`We keep you alive to serve this ship. Row well and live.'). Hugh Griffith earned his Oscar as the humorous Sheik Ilderim who supplies Hur with the Arabian steeds that he will race against Messala in the great circus of Jerusalem (`There is no law in the arena. Many are killed.'). It all comes down to the chariot race that is the center of the second half of the film. There are no special effects here. The race is real. Heston and Boyd actually drive the chariots in almost all the scenes. No doubt, the chariot race is one of the greatest actions sequences in any film.Ben-Hur has just been released on DVD in a superb new transfer with a new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. The epic was filmed in Camera 65 an ultra-wide process that is almost completely revealed on this disc. It would be something to see these classics projected on an IMAX screen. With the success of `Gladiator' someone in Hollywood should re-release the grand epics of the 50's and 60's in their original 70mm splendor. Ben-Hur could then be fully appreciated as the classic it is (one of AFI's greatest 100 films of the 20th century).",10,1,2,29 March 2001

The Thin Red Line," A war film of many beautiful images.
","Terrence Malick's first film since his classic 'Days of Heaven' proves that he is still a master of the medium. This is not the typical war movie. Malick is an artist and his art is film. Each frame of this film is beautifully framed, designed, and rendered. The color and lighting design are like paintings.The battle sequences are very different than 'Saving Private Ryan'. There is much use of slow motion, voice overs and music with sound effects.  The performances are uniformly fine. Elias Koteas must be singled out for his performance as the most fleshed out of the characters.The only fault is the film's length. It's just too much of a good thing. The lack of a clearly drawn plot line definitely hurts the last third. There are also just too many characters. Some just come and then disappear never to be seen or heard from again. George Clooney just pops up in the last few minutes for no discernible reason than to add another star's name to the cast. They did the same thing with 'The Longest Day' thirty years ago.But enough carping. 'The Thin Red Line' will be remembered as one of the landmark war films for its original artistic  approach. It's innumerable painting-like images will long linger in memory.",6,0,0,1 February 1999
Gladiator," The ancient Roman epic genre is well-served by Ridley Scott's new film.
","GLADIATOROver 30 years has elapsed since the heyday of the epic spectaculars of the ancient world. Ridley Scott, director of `Blade Runner,' `Alien,' and `Thelma & Louise,' has brought his fine sense of visuals to renew the genre in his latest film, `Gladiator.' The jumping off point in Roman history is very close to Anthony Mann's `Fall of the Roman Empire' (1964). Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), Roman emperor, is trying to finish off the barbarian hordes who have been attacking at the northern edge of the empire at the Germanic border. Maximus (Russell Crowe), his top general, is ready to finish off the enemy and does in a brutal Saving Private Ryan-like battle. As a matter of fact, he does such a great job, Aurelius wants him to be his successor, passing over the emperor's own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Of course, the overlooked son will have none of this and these circumstances set up the relationships and vengeance for the remainder of the saga. Connie Nielsen portrays Commodus' widowed sister and former lover of Maximus. The rest of the film continues from the northern empire to the north of Africa where Maximus is trained as a gladiator and ultimately back to Rome itself where the final conflicts play themselves out.The film owes much to the epics of the 50's and 60's. The look and style of film is definitely current. However, the small gladiatorial arena in Africa is reminiscent of `Spartacus.' Later sequences in the great Roman Coliseum recall `Quo Vadis,' `Barabbas,' and even `Ben-Hur'. The performances are uniformly good, especially Oliver Reed as slave owner and gladiator trainer, Proximo. Reed died three weeks before filming was completed and computer graphics were utilized to scan his face on another actor to complete his scenes. Other computer-generated effects are unnoticeable for the most part, but some matte paintings are obvious as such, though quite effective.
Of course, most viewers have come for the action sequences seen briefly in the previews and talk show promotions. The action is fast with lots of quick cutting making some of the conflicts difficult to follow. However, they do have a visceral effect, as those early scenes in Private Ryan did. It is fortunate that the connecting dialogue material is smooth and not over-ripe as some of the similar exposition in the 50's-60's films. Phoenix is particularly fine in actually making the viewer sympathize with him. Christopher Plummer played the role way over the top in the earlier `Roman Empire' epic. Nielsen has some genuinely emotional moments with him as incest rears its ugly head, a topic not even hinted at in the earlier film. Sophia Loren and Stephen Boyd were quite wooden in the parts here played by Crowe and Nielsen. Loren always had trouble being natural in English-speaking roles in her early career. Her rare interior and exterior beauty often compensated for that.Scott has created a realistic, though sometimes stylized, ancient world. Viewers hungry for the majesty and conflict of those classic films will not be disappointed. The magnificent widescreen cinematography, best viewed on a large screen, will surely help the 2 hours and 34 minutes seem faster moving than much shorter films today. Hopefully, this film will be a revival of a much-loved genre of years gone by.",8,0,0,7 May 2000
