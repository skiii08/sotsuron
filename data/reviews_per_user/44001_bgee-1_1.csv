Walk the Line," This movie will become a collectors item
","Probably not the movie for anyone born after 1975, but for those who remember the Johnny Cash era - it was brilliantly acted and directed. Got to be the best movie I have seen in the last 10 years. They got just about everything right,the feel of the period, the wardrobe, the music and the wonderful casting. Sorry to see they missed out 'Boy named Sue' in the prison concert but then again perhaps they didn't and it ended up on the cutting room floor. The performances by Reece Witherspoon and Phoenix were as powerful as any I have seen in recent years and the decision for them to actually take on the singing roles proved to be masterful. Was pleased to see that Phoenix captured the 'moody' side of Johnny Cash and even his body lean when on stage. This movie has Academy Awards written all over it.",9,1,2,8 December 2005
