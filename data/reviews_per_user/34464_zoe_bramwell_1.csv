Blade Runner 2049," Long and Boring
","Oh my word, this film is seriously hard work! Lots of scenes of Ryan Gosling walking meaningfully slow, really drawn out causing me to lose interest halfway through. The 'twist' at the end is blatantly obvious and really just makes you go 'yeah,i figured' rather than 'wow'. The visuals are stunning as ever as is the music and the 3D is actually really good, which is for me what has given it a better rating than it deserves. Not a patch on the masterpiece that was the the original but could have been if they hadn't tried so hard to create atmosphere with all the scenes of Ryan smouldering. Knock around 40 minutes off the run time and it would have been epic.",3,9,18,11 October 2017
