Requiem for a Dream," Thoroughly despisable characters, utterly worthless film
","I walked away from the film disgusted, and annoyed at the friend that recommended it. The characters demanded no sympathy and deserved their respective fates. If the movie's aim was to show how bad drugs are, or can be, then it is stating the obvious. If meant as a lesson to prospective drug users, the wrong medium was chosen to send such a message. There was a hint of glamor and excitement when dealing with the decadence that was the characters. I am no sadist and in no way enjoyed watching imbicile youngsters destroy themselves in a movie that glamorizes the process. Utterly despicable.",1,14,29,8 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," if a film can be arrogant.
","For those who have read Tolken's books, or the one coinciding with the recently released Lord of the Rings, I am sure the film was engrossing in it's imagery of 'middle earth' as well as its many references to magical swords, poisonous this or that. The development of characters was ignored allowing me to feel very little sympathy for their fantastic voyage. The film did not stand on it's own two feet but uses as a cruch the assumption that the viewer has read Tolken's timeless fantasy novel. The multitude of Tolken unread paid to sit through the film feeling as if they were the outsider to an ongoing inside joke. The films intentions were weak and ill concieved supposing an audience versed in the travails of hobbots and wizards. This type of exclusivity is something that should be kept in the realm of posh academia and basement comic book stores. I feel as if some pimply geek just got one over on me.",2,1,2,1 February 2002
