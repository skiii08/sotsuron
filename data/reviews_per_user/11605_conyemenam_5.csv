Catch Me If You Can," Fun, Witty, like a Tom and Jerry Movie!!
","I love Tom Hanks, and Leonardo DiCaprio in this film. Tom Hanks was so funny, even in his overly serious character. 'Knock Knock' -- 'Go f*** yourselves'. He looked so foolish when he was beaten by the Secret Service act, and yet so smart and accomplished when apprehending Abagnale in France. In fact, talking of France, DiCaprio acts that scene so naturally, you don't feel, but you understand his willingness for all this to end. The music added to the fun, Spielberg was fantastic, I was shocked that the film came out in 2002, he actually put the watcher in that 19'-something world!!! I love DiCaprio most, not because of the class of his acting, but the youth he managed to put into it. He makes Frank so young and smart at the same time!! He isn't serious, he is a smiling, loving, playboy, and he really gets the audience hunting for what his next stunt, next quick escape is going to be. Film is good, highly recommended. Nice storyline e.t.c. The truth is, i don't know exactly what to say, but you should go watch it and see for yourself.",8,2,3,1 June 2010
Children of Men," This film -- Oh My God, i mean, this film -- Oh My God (omg, i sound like Roger from American Dad)
","OK... where to start: 1) Clive Owen - He was superb. He added a freshness, a humanity to the role. I adored the scene where he was shooting balls from his mouth to his ex's. I felt his pain when she died, and his accomplishment in his slow, yet possibly welcomed death. He never lifted a gun, not once. I don't know why, but maybe the makers thought there was already enough background violence in the film to suffice. Whichever way... it was best.2) The experience - The war was real. The hand-held camera gave it its required ruggedness. They even left the blood splatter on the lens. It was an inspired decision. Ordinarilly, i detest hand-held, but here, what can i say! What worked, worked better than anyone could imagine.3) Michael Caine - His strawberry coated coughing character was splendid, and fun. He was required not to leave the film as a drab dull sequence. Pull my finger!!4) Kee - She was okay. She played her character well, the clueless young, well guided mother. She made the film quite comic, with her virginity allegation, and her desire to name her daughter Bazooka!! But still she made her faith and trust in Leo look so genuine....i don't think IMDb would let me add the rest.",8,1,10,1 June 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Mediocre, but entertaining
","There are 4 distinct aspects of a film. 1)Story 2)Graphics 3)Acting/Cast 4)Dialogue1) The story of Alice in Wonderland was very straightforward. It had none of the twists that most movie lovers simply adore, but one must understand that the purpose of Alice in Wonderland, both Caroll's books and Burton's film is not essentially tha fascinating story, but the creation of a fantastic revived world. 2) Graphics were top notch. I wish I watched this film in IMAX 3D. No complaints here. This is what would entertain most in the film.3) The acting. I fell in love with Alice, and I thought Johnny Depp was mad... really, he pulled off the role in a way i neither expected or anticipated, but in my opinion the most impressive actor was between him and the Red Queen. Oh The Red Queen and that her Big Head.4) Dialogue... crappy (except where Johnny has his mood swings, in some places though, it is very funny, but leaves a critical viewer with the feeling that the 'joke' was set up, instead of flowing naturally.All in all, there are only two flaws, the all to straightforward story, and the crappy dialogue. everything else makes it a must see 6.6/10",7,1,2,5 June 2010
Inception," Simply Amazing
","...if your IQ is below 105, read about it before you watch it. If not, watch and enjoy this cinematic experience.Judgement CategoriesActing: 8.5/10 Graphics: 10/10 Accuracy: 10/10 Plot: 10/10 Music: 9/10 Cinematography: 9/10 AVERAGE: 9.4/10Just my opinion.... but its really good.Honestly, hardly any other director could have pulled off such a complicated script except the one that also brought us The Dark Knight. Nolan is an absolute legend.DiCaprio stars in his first completely original film here, and his acting is more authentic than ever, and this is a good thing, although it is vastly overshadowed by all the amazing tech, and graphics.",9,3,8,8 October 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Blatantly Simple, yet Utterly Beautiful
","To tell the truth, I am speechless. I am a young movie fanatic, in fact, this film came out the same year I was born, and therefore I am more used to films incredible special effects, edge-of-your-seat action, et cetera. This film has none of that, and yet, it appeals so closely to me. The way Frank Darabont uses the narration of Red to drive on the story, the beauty of the soundtrack used (note the harmonica used just before Red's finding of the letter close to the end). The entire film, from beginning to end, from actions to sound, is a beacon of hope, judgement, and redemption. The cast is perfect, Morgan Freeman(Red) actually brings about a refreshing feel to the tale, and that is exactly what the movie is, what a movie should be. Highly recommended for every viewer, no matter your taste(or age- !judgement excludes use of language or violence!). I can't say it deserved its nO.1 position, i can't say any movie does, but if any movie should, this one might as well be it. *********",10,6,9,1 June 2010
