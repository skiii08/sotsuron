Kill Bill: Vol. 2," This off your mind stuff is my type of movie, but?
","This, off the wall out of your mind stuff is just my type of movie, but? So QT should be my type of mind, right? but? Somehow, his going nowhere, still goes nowhere!, isn't that supposed to be the trick of going nowhere spoofs? Not really going nowhere? Or did I miss the point. Well, I know I missed the point, but what wasn't it anyway? Acting? Well, after sniffing all night long, these people tried, really tried. The arrogance of Hollywood.So trite, Quentin, watch a couple of Bruce Lea movies and get some of the basics down, and Uma, take more than a one week refresher night course , body and mind, relax, control, not klutz. Well at least Carradine comes through, he still has the 'Kung Fu' part down, but don't you think he should get better with age? Who did he learn from, a 6th generation ABC? Bow down and pay homage to the greats of Hollyfud, as I apparently, I'm in the minority.",1,1,5,23 June 2005
Monster," Oscar Gold
","In as few words as possible. Grand performance. With so much wasted gold in Hollywood, their politics, their society, their Red Carpet and Shakespearian Drama aside, it's good to see the real thing. A rare commodity. Not the overdone emotional stuff where the drama pulls your heartstrings and you hurt and pine for the wicked killer turned bad by society. No, that happens, but it's just down to earth, put this in your pipe, and smoke it. She is real. The movie left something to be desired, but, thanks Charlize. You are now on a very short list. Nuff said, but this review needs two more lines to be accepted. So I will waste no more of your time.",9,0,1,9 February 2005
Alexander," Another 'Great' unable to climb out of the dung heap.
","The title 'Alexander the Great' was changed to 'Alexander'.I understand completely. Apparently no one has even come close to living up to the full name since it's original owner, and Stone was at least smart enough to know that. How diabolically sad though, so I should likely explain why I rated this movie as I did. There are no spoilers, as nothing could spoil it any more than it is.I am an extreme Alexander enthusiast, half of my bookshelves are filled with Alexander the Great, anything the least bit connected to him, no matter how motley, I regard with a level of Ahhh!, paying outlandish prices for even drivel about him. I was certainly not expecting a detailed historically accurate, roaring documentary and was more that ready to completely embrace any historical blasphemy.This was worse than blasphemy, I saw it when it came out and was so utterly and completely demoralized that only now, in the middle of 2007 can I face this and think about the movie again. Please also understand that Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer can do no wrong. Yet I can’t remember, nor wish to remember almost anything about this movie. It is more than a bitter pill, as it also put the kibosh on Scorsese 'Alexander' project with Leonardo DiCaprio, not that I had high hopes for that either.Apparently the second greatest man to ever walk the earth must wait longer yet for someone great enough to tell his story. I was hoping with three directors competing, one of them may provide at least a smidgen of it's own history. Regretfully now it will not likely be in my lifetime. I'm so disappointed I'd give it a 'ZERO' if I could and most of the evaluation comments made here were a waste of time, positive or negative. I wouldn't dignify the movie.",1,2,4,16 July 2007
Just Go with It," Why ??
","There are a lot of questions one might ask about this movie. One should be, why did they make it? Does anyone of them need the money? I can't see any other reason.Evey comic premise in this movie has been used sooooo often it isn't funny anymore, even if it were done properly and worked, which nothing did work.Both of the leads are capable and experienced, but no one even seemed into making this movie including Nicole Kidman. They all just showed up. The only one that seemed happy about doing this movie was Brooklyn Decker. One last question, where did they find those kids? The little girl is still playing Annie and the kid is supposed to be a dud, he qualifies. They must be related to someone financing the movie. Please send them back to school.",3,3,7,22 November 2011
Lost in Translation," An 8 ?, #166 ? Oscar ?, Are we desperate for something new?
","You hate to think it isn't talent. Maybe it's not inherited, but talent anyway. Not just another spoiled Hollywood brat? Could that be? But then it is very good for your JC film project. Isn't it? It is apparent she has spent a lot of time in 5 star hotels, billion dollar offices and tourist shops. Maybe she should get out sometime and see a bit more of 'Asia'.Well worth watching though. A better than good first try and with Bill Murray, well what can you say? With Scarlett Johansson, the off beat is apparently her style and with this and Pearl ?, well can she do it again?",5,1,4,16 January 2005
Cold Mountain," Why Oh Why can't Hollywood just make a good movie.
","OK, this is my type of movie. So why did I despise the director for making it, how could he waste so much of a good thing, lack so much common sense, live in such degradation, and ruin such a plot? So, I read other commentaries to see if I'm psycho. It seems I'm not alone, there are others, very bitter and disappointed.I thought Law was supposed to be good, well he is, so why waste it?Kidman begins to shine, you start to feel her character, and she is loosing that, I'm a cold bitch look, I could fall for her now, but wasted character.Well Renée? We've got to love her for this part, she was having fun and so was I. She did well despite the likely best parts on the cutting room floor.A supporting cast? Whow!, long list of wonderful character and characters that filled the basket even fuller, but the production scattered it all to the wind. No matter how well they did, it was an impossible task of bringing it all back together.Where does this creative crew live? The dark side? With no personal fortitude, no faith? The whole world sh-ts on them? Life's not worth living? Then, what a cheep shot for and ending scene, there is no redemption in guilt. Do a good job in the first place. Something more than Ruby should have shined.When having something good, it should have been building plot and character, but it quit cold, when it should quit and move on, it dragged on, then came back and threw in more. This movie started so many good ideas and characters it didn't use, and wasted so much on the irrelevant. There is enough real horror in war without creating your own useless paranoia.Damn it was a good movie, why couldn't it have been a good movie.Ratting is hard. Half gets a 10, half gets a 2, but I'll watch it again and save a copy.",7,0,1,29 May 2005
Legends of the Fall," siding with the skeptics of this movie
","After sitting on this a while, my, this is good stuff that good movies are made of and, there are some big problems and holes, dilemma, left me siding with the skeptics of this movie.With all this talent, with all this production, the director didn't take it anywhere important, although there were many delectable sinews to work with. Maybe the author did? The cynical point could have been made so much better and so much more rewarding. (a self centered, self serving, selfish soul makes all those souls around him as tragic as he is, even when it is Brad Pitt as a troubled, earthy, free spirit.) It dragged and there were so many things to cover better, there was no need to stretch it out and dwell. This did not result in a relaxing movie, as the ploy is supposed to and the soul of the movie wasn't intended to be so anyway. The characters didn't mesh and there was sooooo much character and actors to carry it. It seemed so much never got on film and if it did, it is on the cutting room floor.This film left me hollow, waiting, missing something, when there are so many other gut wrenching tidbits that were only superficially dramatized, and some corny!!. There was good material here but it received only a Best Cinematography Oscar and was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Sound, ???? What a waste. It should have been much better.",6,1,3,8 December 2007
The Pianist," Sorry, but maybe as a Polanski fan I set my hopes too high.
","Sorry, but maybe as a Polanski fan I set my hopes too high.  The scatter and senseless violence were the Polanski we all love, but just another Holocaust movie?  He is more original, and the story should be better.  Too bad, maybe he's getting older too.",5,2,5,12 April 2003
Meet Joe Black," Count me in, too long, too slow, too boring, three strikes, and all air.
","Somebody had an idea, and played all around the outside, I kept hoping they would find it, but they never seemed to.  Then they explained something in a supplement after the movie, I think I know what they said they thought they wanted to do, but didn't.Hopkins; overdone, this isn't the stage, yet he never got there, wherever it was. Yell, whisper, couldn't see either. Pitt; where did he see this simpleton stuff? Theatre 101?  Forlani, I know she was supposed to be a naive daddies girl, but, but, I'd like to see he do something good.If you like these two guys, see the movie.",4,1,2,29 August 2003
Love Actually," Deep & provoking? Shallow & stock?
","What !! ?? Started up muddled, and after much patience, maybe it became a little more solidified by the end, but then, just as, well, it was over. In the beginning it was probably a good idea, maybe even should have made a good movie, but? More just disappointed from the let down though.Always knew the Brits had a mixed up view of love and relationships, it must be the total mixed bag of cultures, as it doesn't always mix and that confuses them.'You could spend ages just trying to work out where the various connections between the story lines actually were.' Humm? I expect to use my mind a bit, as formula is hollow, but I truly believe at least the director should know the answer to this issue. The commentary leaves it a real issue. Maybe he shouldn't have cut the hour out; then again maybe he should have cut another hour out. A few scenes and moments only makes me more frustrated with the rest of the mess.I don't mind the syrup, nor the Gordian thing, but it moves through a façade, pretending profound, then you realize how shallow, maybe stock. Oh well onward.",6,0,2,1 February 2005
Ben-Hur," Aged well, dated, Yes-But
","12 deserved Oscars, how can it be topped, at least as a percent of those available?     Now they give them for best toenail decoration, on an animated character, in an original screen play etc. etc.     When they can't find someone, they give it to some 'Political Correction' from last year.Lets hope in almost 50 years we have improved our movie making and acting.  Not by much though, especially considering the money, animation and technology.    At best they can try to copy smidgens.    This is real movie makin', in the hay day of movies and it still has at least two best scenes in the history of movies, that can't be equaled, despite Heston's over acting.    Three cheers.",10,0,2,10 April 2004
