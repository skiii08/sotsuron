Marie Antoinette," Critics are too harsh
","I read reviews only AFTER i see movies because I hate critics. This time what I saw was no different, I loved this film. The more I think about it the more I liked it.The only reviewer that I would even consider reading before a go to a movie would be the Onion's AV club. The only reason is, is that I'm used to what they say and I can sift through all the crap. Although I did not read the AV club before-hand, they do make light of the really notable things about the movie, such as Sofia Coppola's directing skills, but they weren't thrilled about the movie as a whole, being too much like a normal period piece that has to check off every major point in the history of Marie Antoinette. But this wasn't what concerned me, All over I have been hearing the complaints about the rock, punk, and new-wave soundtrack laying on top of the film. It frustrates me, because this only means that Sofia Coppola took a creative way to express pretty much a child queen. And I didn't think that it was in any way too distracting from the movie.Another reason why critics lower this movie is because of Kirsten Dunst's role. I did see how they could have thought that her 'flat line-readings' took away from it, but it felt as if that feeling went away after at least 10 minutes into the movie.",9,4,7,20 October 2006
