Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Excellent tribute to 70s martial arts movies AND classic westerns...
","Great movie with little tributes here and there to movies Tarantino's seen in the past.  Camera shots from John Ford, theme music reminiscent of Sergio Leone, character names  showing his influences were as varied as Budd Boeticcher  and whoever did 'The Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz'.He combines these all with the crackling dialogue and full-out bloody action you expect from Tarantino, 'Jackie Brown' not withstanding. Granted, I am a fan and thought 'Pulp Fiction' was a fantastic film. This may not be a date movie, unless you are dating one of those strange roleplaying women who dig violence. If you are, then go to town and enjoy...",10,1,2,16 April 2004
