Come and See," A Paralyzing View
","This film aims to show you the perspective of an uncorrupted young boy who initially dreamed of the heroism in fighting World War 2. A type of unreal-realism that makes you question human nature, giving you a first hand view of the ugly impact war has on civilians. The protagonist is dropped at the center of the alarmingly morbid war, where he immediately witnesses death again and again. A paralyzing view which shows the unpublished secrets of the war, and the side most important and compelling amongst the madness; the innocent. After coming out of this movie you can't help but feel exposed to the true curse of war. Raw and symbolic, there is no sugar-coating to be found.",10,1,1,3 August 2009
