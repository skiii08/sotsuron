Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't listen to the critics
","There were a lot of negative reviews of this film.  I don't believe any of them and neither should you.  Of course the effects were amazing, but the actors were just as good.  When I saw Ewan McGregor, I swore that he was a young Alec Guinness.  He was that good.  Jake Lloyd, who took a lot of heat, played exactly what he is; a ten year old boy standing on the brink of something so great that he is just awed by it.  Even Jar Jar made me laugh! THe fight scenes between Qui-Gonn, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul are classic.  In short, the critics dropped the ball on this one.  Everyone in the theater thought that is was a worthy beginning to the legendary saga.",9,0,0,22 May 1999
