United 93," War between the evolved and the unevolved
","Throughout the 4 million years of human evolution the higher plane of our species has exterminated or 'bred out' the lower plane. Right now we are in a war with over 100 million extremists who want humanity to forever live in the 15th century from a social standpoint. These extremists will lose eventually because they are smaller in number and less intelligent than the more evolved of our species who view civil behavior as being defined by it's ability NOT TO HIJACK planes and kill innocents to convince people of the legitimacy of their point of view.This movie was excellent. It shows the events of that day and lets the viewer make value judgments based on their own intellectual/emotional abilities.On a side note. If you read the reviews on this page you will find 1 or more people beginning their review with (paraphrasing), 'So I gotta crank out 10 lines when all I wanna do is shout a single sentence of profanity to show everyone how I, and the hijackers, have something in common. Neither of us can critique something without engaging in verbal violence.' I just find it strange how many reviewers on IMDb start their review that way, never understanding how they've lost the audience before the end of their first sentence. They obviously don't want to sway anyone, they just want to intimidate people, knowing that their arguments come from a diseased mind that needs to be relegated to the land of the extinct.",9,6,12,17 September 2007
American Sniper," A great movie and a reminder there are still men yearning to be heroes
","First off why does IMDb insist on trashing this movie by posting the most infantile and inane reviews on the title page of this movie.This movie was better than The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty. And I thought both of those movies were excellent.I think Bradley Cooper is at his zenith right now, and he combined his talent with a director at the zenith of his powers.Together they have created a war movie to stir your mind, your heart and your soul.War is hell, we all know that. But as long as evil and righteousness combat each other, we will call upon heroes like Chris Kyle to defend us against those who believe that making a video of themselves cutting off a girls head with a knife is a sign of true manhood.Kyle is a hero. Iftekhar Tanveer, is just another ISIS loyalist who should be fed to the crocodiles.",10,12,29,28 January 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Enjoyable action flick
","Many reviewers will be turned off by the politics. In other words, anything pro-American is looked at with disdain. It's why Superman was changed in the 2006 and 2013 reboots. The 'American Way' is now looked upon by Americans with even more revulsion than that felt by foreigners. Not sure when this self-hating strain became a tsunami but I think the 60s would be a good guess for it's genesis.This film should be rated higher than 6.8. It's a nice little WW2 movie spiced up with sci-fiction and spy movie action. It brings forth some old-fashion ideas that have fallen out of favor while also embracing some old-fashion values with have not fallen out of favor.Watch the movie without the veil of politics screaming at your brain and you and your gal can enjoy some popcorn and soda along with your big budget Hollywood entertainment.",10,1,6,6 June 2014
Captain America: Civil War," DC fan with mental illness issues
","Giving it a 1 star is way too generous. A minus 1 would be more apt for this travesty called a movie which should have definitely been nominated and won the raspberry award that year. There is not much by way of plot. As usual, there is an overload of unnecessary useless 'comedy' at inappropriate times that made me roll my eyes everytime. And the villain.. where do i even begin!! Its almost 4 years and i still dont get why he was IN the movie in the first place. Anyone having an iota of common sense and self respect can give this movie a very well deserved hard pass. I pity the people giving this movie a 9 or 10. For the love of god there are better movies that deserve to earn more money than this garbage.^^^^^^^ safricarr -- author of the sewage you see above. It's depressing this person can vote and procreate, helps explain the world as it is today.",9,0,1,13 May 2020
Lincoln," 'I have several advanced degrees and can handle didactic films' - Captain Elite
","It's an important film more than it's a good film. Steven Spielberg said while promoting the film: 'It's funny how the republicans and democrats have switched places since 1865.'
I don't think it is funny and it certainly isn't true. The democrats are still in favor of slavery and a society divided into 'elites' and 'slaves'.
Democrats (slavery-jim crow-KKK-antifa-dependency-moral & financial bankruptcy - internment camps)
Republicans (defeated slavery in 1865 and then lost their spinal cord a few years later and have never regained it - they should've destroyed the party of evil and they didn't. And history will judge them harshly for that)
This movie does a good job of showing Lincoln as a man. It's easier and more fun to think of him as superhuman. Ya know why we think of him that way, because everyone else in comparison doesn't measure up. This movie helps you understand why that is true.",10,1,2,25 February 2020
Sicario," Benicio is the star
","He is brilliant in this movie.Emily, as always, is horrible. How she gets work is mind-boggling. I guess whenever Hollywood needs an unattractive, shrill, entitled actress, they can turn to her.Josh Brolin ain't bad, but this movie is a showcase for BDT and boy does he deliver. He is a gem in a Hollywood filled with hacks and duds.The movie deals with the reality and the geopolitics of two borderless countries with different ideals and priorities.There's plenty of intrigue with just the right amount of action. It has an intelligent and brutally honest script. It deals with narcoterrorism and the feckless way the USA and Mexico deal with it.It also delves into the internal politics that govern both countries law enforcement establishment. I want to compare it to 'Blow' and 'Traffic', but it is honestly better than those two movies. And I thought those two moves were great, so that should tell you how good this movie is.",8,1,3,26 April 2017
Hercules," One of Disney's best
","Walt himself said: 'I believe the best learning happens when something is presented in an entertaining way.' Walt was right of course, and Hercules teaches a little while it entertains a lot. The opening gives kids a window into ancient Greece and it's fables designed to impart lessons to the masses.The movie itself has some A-list entertainers and is fun and well written. Obviously it's aimed at kids, but the grown-ups will find plenty of laughs and lots of tender smiles. The thing that has always captured the publics imagination regarding Disney classics is the power of the heart and the struggle between good and bad (or righteousness and evil in this case). I won't be redundant and share the plot with you. Quite frankly if you don't know the story of Hercules this movie is a pleasant primer. Maybe it will inspire you to go to the library and learn more about Hercules and Greek Tragedies in general. The Tragedies predate many spiritual works and probably provided much of the motivation for theological and philosophical works to follow.Just sit back with your kids or someone you luv and enjoy 90 plus minutes of light hearted fun with a timeless message. It's better than anything on TV or cable if you need a justification, but you wont.",10,0,4,8 June 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Fail Mode
","Wow. Just wow. If you thought that director Michael Bay was going to take a gentler approach to the third film then be prepared for a surprise. Dark Of The Moon is huge both in action and in the amount of CGI. This time the decepticons have a very transformers-like plan to take over the world. Who stand in their way? Only a small number of autobots and humans. How good is the film? It's somewhere between the first and the second films. It has only two things going for it: the fantastic CGI and the impressive 3D presentation. For a film like this Bay has given up such things as character development, a coherent story or tight direction. Dark Of The Moon is a mess, but not as much as Revenge Of The Fallen. Characters come and go for little or no reason. The humor is awkward, lousy or disgusting. Some scenes are underdeveloped or unnecessary. The acting is bad or passable. The score is loud and generic. The American patriotism is, once again, over the top. A shocker is in store for viewers concerning the American space program. But the worst thing is that Michael Bay still hasn't learned (or decided to ignore) why the transformers cartoons were likable. The transformers themselves were real characters, and they looked different and interesting. In this film it takes some effort to see who's who when they're fighting. Dark Of The Moon is a money-making product at its simplest. It's meant to lure audiences with its predictable combination of humor, action and special effects. It's passable entertainment, but I wouldn't watch it a second time. Like the previous two transformers films Dark Of The Moon is a true product of the Bush era.^^^^^ Why does IMDb tolerate political rants masquerading as reviews? The hissy-fit above seems to serve only one purpose: A cry for help from the mentally ill.",Null,1,6,18 July 2011
The Birds," Not a 10, but close
","Hitchcock is one of the best directors ever. The special affects will make you cringe. But you'll probably forgive that because of other elements like: script, cinematography, location, thought-provoking eco-commentary, etc.
Why did I give it such a high rating? Because in the hands of another director this story would've come across like Plan 9 From Outer Space.
I also like the fact that the movie spends as much time making you think as it does tapping into your primal fears.
It's my favorite Hitchcock movie. Is it his best? That's for others to decide.",9,1,1,22 March 2020
