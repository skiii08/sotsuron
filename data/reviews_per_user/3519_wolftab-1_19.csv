Changeling," Another Gem by Eastwood and a Powerhouse Performance by Angelina Jolie
","Once again, Clint Eastwood gives us a thought provoking and deeply emotional film. The Changeling. It was much better than I expected. A true story of an LA woman in the late 1920's, who's son is kidnapped and the LAPD decides to substitute another child and demonstrably makes the woman believe it is her son, despite her protestations. Angelina Jolie does a great job as the mother, Christine Collins in an emotionally gut wrenching role. I loved how she was living out her imaginary circumstances. Powerful stuff. John Malkovich portrays the Rev. Gustav Briegleb, who is on a crusade to bring the LAPD's corruption and wrong doings to light. I heard many reviews citing that character is being manipulative and using Christine Collins for his own gain. Not sure of the actual story, but in the film, I disagree with that assessment, I think the Reverend was portrayed as a hero and the lone voice in the wilderness that would listen to Christine Collins and do what he could to help. Malkovich is as fine as ever.As for the LAPD, excellent performance by Jeffrey Donovan as the cold and heartless Captain Jones, who torments Christine Collins. Primarily a television actor, Donovan was very good as a man you love to hate. Colm Feore, portrays Police Chief Davis in a somewhat lesser role but did a decent job as well.The sub plot to Changeling is equally riveting. A kidnapped Canadian boy forced to helping a serial killer slay children and somehow this all gets enmeshed in the Christine Collins story. I was impressed by Jason Butler Harner as Gordon Northcott. I have never seen him before. Another predominant television actor, but he has good chops and I enjoyed his performance.And of course the film would be nowhere without the talents of Clint Eastwood. Time and again, he keeps showing us what a remarkable film maker he truly is. As an actor's director, I would love to work with him some day, if I am fortunate enough. Changeling is hard to imagine being a true story, considering all that goes on in the film. I am surprised it has gotten little Oscar recognition, especially Angelina has been practically written off in pre Oscar balloting. But, she excellent and a lot better than Kate Winslet in The Reader. I give Changeling 4 Stars. Check it out.",8,4,6,18 February 2009
Frost_Nixon," Ron Howard's Metaphoric Attempt at Putting Bush in the Hot Seat
","A fine rendition of the play of the same name. Michael Sheen and Frank Langella reprise their roles from the play as David Frost and Richard Nixon in a story about one of the most famous political interviews in the history of television where a struggling English talk show host, David Frost scores an interview with then former President Nixon and gets him to admit wrongdoing in the Watergate scandal. At times it has the typical clich√©d feeling of the underdog-going-up-against-the-champion type story but it was entertaining. However, I felt like Mr. Howard was using Nixon as a metaphor for President Bush and wanting to put Bush in the hot seat for all of his wrongdoings as President, with himself as Frost. The portrayal of Nixon was fairly pathetic, but then again, there is no version that of him that is flattering, especially Anthony Hopkins version in Oliver Stone's 'Nixon.' What was interesting is how much of a money grubber Nixon is shown to be, ie; always wanting more money for doing the interviews. Not to mention being delusional, as in not recalling a drunken phone call to Frost a few nights before their final interview.Parts of the film are a little slow and oftentimes too grandiose for a story of this kind. But the climax is a huge payoff and Langella does an incredible job of portraying the desolation, the anguish and loneliness of Nixon. However, I liked his nonverbal emotions to his vocal inflections better. Sheen does a admirable job as the partying playboy Frost. You can see how he feels about his difficult circumstance and how everything he had was literally on the line with the success of this interview. The supporting cast led by Kevin Bacon, who goes back to his cold loyalist part he played similar to A Few Good Men as Nixon's chief of staff Jack Brennan. It works for Kevin and he is good at it. Oliver Platt also plays his typical sardonic, caustic witted type character as Bob Zelnick. Sam Rockwell plays the whiny, revenge filled James Weston who wants nothing more than to make Nixon pay. Rebecca Hall plays Caroline Cushing, in a not much to do part except smile, look pretty and be strong for her man, role. However, she conveys good compassion when called on. At the helm, Ron Howard, who's direction seems a bit rushed and distracted at times, especially when he is showing who David Frost is. I didn't have a strong feeling for Frost one way or another but it was a good attempt.",7,0,2,24 April 2009
Star Trek," A Solid Prequel
","The eagerly anticipated reboot of the the Star Trek series finally has arrived with (technically the 11th film in the series) the self titled Star Trek by the popular new action/drama wunderkind JJ Abrams at the helm. In full disclosure I need to point out that I have been a huge Star Trek fan (mainly Next Generation) for a long time. When I heard they wanted to give a much needed jump start to the franchise by making a prequel, I was skeptical. I mean, c'mon, do we really need to see a movie of Kirk and Spock Go to Starfleet. But, for all intent and purpose, JJ Abrams has done a pretty good job of making a younger, slicker and action packed Star Trek that introduces us to the beloved characters that have been satirized and joked about for decades.The film straddles the two worlds of hardcore Trekkies and non Trekkies alike by exploring the origins of the two main characters...James Tiberius Kirk and a half human/half Vulcan named Spock. Unbeknown to them, they share a common bond of family tragedy in their lives. We meet them both as precocious children in their own right. The rebellious Kirk and the ever logical Spock. But, what I liked is they give Spock more freedom of expression than what we would see in the original series and the subsequent first 6 films. Mercifully, we are quickly taken through their days of Star Fleet and how they came to join the Academy. Their paths of getting there were similar in its guise and it is here that we also are introduced to Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy who quickly befriends Kirk. All this while, the evil Captain Nero of the enemy Romulans is wrecking havoc on the galaxy and it is up to our young and inexperienced heroes traveling in the newly christened Enterprise to save the day, which you know they will...it's Star Trek.Before I get into what is good about the film let me say what I didn't like about it. Aside from the usual predictability and necessary suspension of disbelief. I was not at all interested in the evil Romulan threat, it wasn't interesting enough. And of course, in Star Trek world, when in doubt throw in a time travel plot line. I also felt JJ rushed through the introductions of the characters and giving some of them like McCoy cute dialogue that is representative of how we have come to know these characters in the past. The climax was also quick and clean, without any real suspense. I'll get into the acting soon enough. What I liked about the film was the special effects were fantastic, seeing Leonard Nimoy again as Spock. He certainly still remembers the characterization very well. Trekkies will love bringing in Captain Pike but he seemed to be an afterthought once we are settled on to the Enterprise As for the acting. First of all, before I get slammed with angry messages, let me just say that Star Trek is not a story that demands stellar acting. However, as an actor, good work is demanded of you at all times to make the story truthful. Chris Pine who portrays the iconic James T Kirk grows on you. He embody's the characteristics we know about Kirk, a horny, rebel who plays by his own rules. But, except for one occasion he made Kirk his own with no trace of William Shatner and I applaud him for that. Zachary Quinto (Sylar from Heroes) brought emotional depth underneath all that logic and I thought he was the best of them all. The great Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead himself) was pretty funny as Scotty and I welcomed his comic relief. As for Karl Urban as McCoy. He was highly irritating. He essentially mimicked DeForest Kelley's work as McCoy and although you hear imitation is the finest form of flattery, it's not in this case. Create your own character. Same goes for Anton Yelchin as Chekov, he just mimicked. Walter Koenig. Some found it cute. I didn't. John Cho did a decent job as Sulu, we certainly see a new side of him. Zoe Saldana as Uhura also decided to create her own character and even though she is essentially filler, she made the most of her scenes. There is an interesting twist to her love life from the original series that's for sure. Finally, Eric Bana as Captain Nero was boring and completely devoid of interest for me. He was indicating badly to the point of annoyance. Great Star Trek villains like Ricardo Montelban as Khan, Christopher Plummer as General Chang and Alice Krige as the Borg Queen all made me feel something about who they are and the reasons why they did what they did. I hope JJ takes note of that in the next one.Overall, Star Trek is entertaining with all it's faults (there are gaps in the writing). I would rate it the 4th best in the film series. It's not a great film but it exceeded my expectations. As far as prequels go, this was one of the better ones I've seen. Yes, it's is even better than Star Wars Episode 1. However, I would recommend in the sequel that JJ take his time and not rush through sequences and make the villains have more depth. I give Star Trek 3 stars and is out now in a theater near you.",7,2,12,9 May 2009
Public Enemies," Disappointing Bipic, but don't blame Johnny Depp
","Michael Mann's much anticipated biopic about notorious bank robber John Dillinger (played expertly by Johnny Depp) comes up short. The story of John Dillinger and how he became a notorious bank robber who liked living the good life while eluding the newly formed FBI all the while laughing at them as they kept coming up short in trying to catch him. And when they did catch him, no prison could hold him. This sounds like it would make a pretty interesting story, unfortunately, Michael Mann didn't see it that way. Public Enemies is in a word¬Öslow. The pacing is deliberate and more importantly for a character driven drama, I didn't find much clarity in what made John Dillinger, John Dillinger. The film doesn't have any back story to Dillinger, as it takes place in 1933 after a daring prison break. We are shown that Dillinger is a man of few words, has a cool confidence, thinks big and when he wants something, he will aggressively pursue it, whether it be knocking off banks or going after women. But, one woman in particular catches his fancy, Billie Frechette, (Marion Cotillard) a hat check girl he becomes smitten with at a club. On the flip side, are the 'good guys' of the FBI. J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup) is tired of all these glorified gangsters, forms a task force to get them, led by Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). Dillinger is listed as Public Enemy #1 and Hoover tells Purvis to do whatever it takes to bring in the popular bank robber.The film has a strong cast but many of them prove to be uninteresting, there are of course exceptions Johnny Depp does a very fine job as Dillinger. He played the character with strong convictions, bravura and was a likable crook. Mr. Depp seemed to know what made Dillinger tick, but aside from a few brief clues, it was not clear to me. Unfortunately, without that clarity, his character wasn't permitted to have an arc, so I was left feeling ambivalent about him and what he stood for. His acting was unforced, honest and truthful. He is fun to watch. Marion Cotillard (who was fantastic as Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose) does an admirable job as Dillinger's moll and she had a good connection with him and their relationship looked genuine. Billy Crudup does a very nice job as Hoover. He certainly had his mannerisms and speech patterns down. It is a shame we didn't see more of him. Which leads me to Christian Bale. He seemed at a loss as to how best to bring his character to life. Judging by a fact we discover at the end, it would seem that Purvis was a conflicted man but Mr. Bale seemed to just play him with one note throughout¬Östoic. Not really sure how he felt about Dillinger, except for a few glimmers of dialogue. His brief scene with Depp was bereft of tension. Depp clearly had more going on. Mr. Bale seemed tired to me and who could blame him, filming this amidst The Dark Knight and Terminator: Salvation. He did seem to realize this was Johnny Depp's film and to his credit he doesn't try to outshine him. Lili Taylor makes a brief appearance and it was not a memorable one, for such a fine actress.Michael Mann puts forth an earnest effort but alas this is not one of his best work; either with screenplay or direction. The film lacks suspense, drama and more often than not feels like it is going through the motions. He does a lot of research that brings a rarely seen realism to that era, especially when we see early wiretapping. The film really falls apart in the last 1/3 and the climax fizzles. Despite several good scenes scattered throughout, the film falls flat.",5,8,26,25 June 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Fairly Predictable But Entertaining
","The summer blockbuster movie season is upon us. After months (seemingly years) of endless promotion Wolverine...X Men: Origins, has finally slashed its way onto the big screen. Let me first start out by saying that I have not read any of the Wolverine comics, never was the biggest fan of X Men. But Wolverine is a pretty cool character and so I wanted to see where he came from. We find out where he came from all right, but it is not very clear as to how someone who is born in the 1840's is alive and kicking today. We understand that Wolverine has regenerative powers (only from previous X men films and if you hasn't seen those, you would be lost) but regenerative powers does not longevity make, or so I thought. He has all this longevity and can never die as well, except for cutting his head off. (If you just read that and think he's a vampire, I sympathize but you would be mistaken). I understand, it's a comic book movie and therefore you need more than the usual suspension of disbelief. However, that is a pretty important plot point to clue the audience in I would say. We learn all of this in a good montage in the opening credits where our hero Logan aka Wolverine played by Hugh Jackman (as if you didn't know by now) who's power is having his bones jut out of his hands like knives and his half brother Victor who also has the same longevity and regenerative powers but has claws and acts like a big cat and who's name is Sabretooth ( although they never say it, again you have to have watched the first X Men film for that) played by Liev Schreiber are seen fighting in the American Civil War, World Wars 1 and 2, Korea and Vietnam. The funny thing is, they are Canadian. Setting aside, nationality and historical semantics for a while, we also learn that Victor is a pretty sick cat (pun intended) and that Logan has to constantly remind him to chill. But, as fate would have it, Victor goes too far in Vietnam, which causes both him and Logan to be executed by a firing squad. Surprise, they don't die and are sent to a stockade instead. Enter, Colonel William Stryker (Danny Huston) who recognizes their powers and entices them to join his secret team of mutants to go on missions.From here, the film becomes fairly predictable. We meet the team of mutants, including Wade, who is the most sarcastic of the bunch (played by Ryan Reynolds, who can't seem to play anything else and note to Ryan it is not cute, it's annoying as hell). They go on a certain mission in Africa which rubs Logan entirely the wrong way and he quits the team. Although, hasn't he learned from other action films, that you just can't quit a military operation without consequences. So, Logan becomes a lumberjack in British Columbia, meets and falls in love with a school teacher when his past comes calling. Obviously he turns it down, but when tragedy strikes, Logan is hell bent on revenge. Victor is back to his old killing tricks and it's up to Logan to take him down. But, Logan needs an edge in killing his older brother, so Stryker convinces Logan to let him experiment on him by injecting an indestructible metal (Adamantium) onto Logan's skeletal structure. Hence, the metallic claws are born. Here, Stryker wants to erase Logan's memories to make him an obedient soldier. Logan overhears this while underwater and decides he wants no part of it. He escapes and the adventure truly begins.From here, the film descends into predictable Hollywood formulaic action plot twists about Logan being double crossed and going after both Victor and Stryker and meeting other mutants along the way, including a fan favorite...Gambit who for some reason was not in the previous 3 X Men films. They did a good job with the ending, which helps explain why Logan, in the other X Men films, doesn't seem to remember who or what he is. There is a pretty comical sequence with The Blob (Kevin Durand).Wolverine is a typical action film, so I will not be overly critical of the acting but I give Hugh Jackman a lot of credit. This is his 4th time brandishing Wolverine's claws and he didn't phone it in and still gave a lot of life to his character. Liev Schreiber did a good job as the villainous Victor and Danny Huston was also pretty good as Stryker. They all seemed to understand their characters and lived out their imaginary circumstances fairly well. The writing for the most part was better than the previous X Men films but for some reason the folks who write X Men films, have a terrible time with catchy one liners (see Halle Berry in the first X Men for probably the worst one liner ever). Aside from that, Gavin Hood did a good job with the directing. If you are a big action buff, you will not be disappointed. For me, the Dark Knight is still the new gold standard for comic book films and Wolverine is not in its league and it's not supposed to be and that's alright. Wolverine is a good popcorn film.",6,3,7,3 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Lots of Plot Holes But Great Effects
","Another summer blockbuster is upon us with McG's Terminator Salvation. A prequel set in the future to the Terminator series. To those familiar with the Terminator story, the film takes place in 2018, years after the military computer system called Skynet has become self aware. Having deemed humans a threat and in what humans call Judgement Day, Skynet launches a nuclear assault wiping out most of mankind. The rest are hunted by machines called Terminators. However, there is hope for mankind in the form of the legendary resistance fighter, John Connor(Christian Bale). The film centers around the resistance to the machines. Connor is tasked with finding a teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin, who is our hero from the first Terminator who, as you recall, traveled back in time to save John's mother Sarah Connor) who, like Connor is targeted for execution. Into the mix is a mysterious 'man' called Marcus, who in 2003 was executed but donated his body to Cyberdyne Systems (and for those Terminator fanboys and girls, we know who Cyberdyne is) and resurfaces after 15 years. But is he friend or foe? It is a race against time for the resistance against the dreaded machines.Now, I'm a huge fan of the Terminator series, except for the terrible TV show. I had always been curious about what a film would be like that explored the time of John Connor taking on the machines in the future. However, I was skeptical when I heard McG would be the one to show us this future. But, he does a pretty decent job. The action is really good and the effects are fantastic. The first half of the film is exciting and keeps your interest. Unfortunately, it cannot sustain itself as holes in the plot become apparent and there is suspension of disbelief that is just too unbelievable to the point of laughable. There are some clever references to the previous Terminator films and a very special surprise in store. You will recognize the catch phrases, although one made famous by Arnold Schwarzenegger is force fed into the dialogue that it is just too contrived.As for the acting, a lot has been made of Christian Bale's meltdown on the set that became viral several months ago and I for one have been very critical of Mr. Bale for doing that. But, he does a good job as John Connor. He did not play him with any Hollywood swagger, but a believable soldier who is in a very tough spot, he is reminiscent of the way Michael Biehn portrayed Reese in the first Terminator. All business. But, Bale does it with more finesse and frankly is a better actor. He was living out his imaginary circumstance with truthfulness and is effective. Anton Yelchin, (certainly has a good agent, getting the job as Reese and also portraying Chekov in Star Trek) does an adequate job as Reese but is fairly forgettable. Sam Worthington as Marcus is a worthy partner for Bale and they seemed to play off each other fairly well. Rounding out the cast are veterans, Helena Bonham Carter and Michael Ironside who also do a good job in their respective limited roles.",7,2,4,25 May 2009
Milk," Not Lactose Intolerant for Milk
","It's hard not to watch Milk and think it is not a labor of love by Gus Van Sant. Great care and attention to detail was taken to make this film and it shows in every shot. But, that is not to say it is a great film but a good film nonetheless. For those who are not aware (like myself), Milk is the biopic of the first openly gay City Supervisor of San Francisco, Harvey Milk. He was assassinated in November of 1978 in City Hall. The film shows his rise and tragic murder. Harvey Milk stood up for Gay Civil Rights and put himself on the firing line to make his voice and opinions heard and he became a martyr for his cause.But, unlike great biopics of martyrs like Gandhi, Malcolm X (I am still waiting for a definitive look at Martin Luther King), Milk does not have a strong arc to make us become more engaged in his story. By all accounts, Harvey Milk was a regular, ordinary guy. But, like many at the time, he was closeted for presumably a long period of his life before he came out and at 40 started a whole new life to make a difference(as a new member of the 40 club, I took notice of that). Yet, we only hear a reference of him not wanting to come out and upset his family. There is a point in the film where he demands young gay men to come out to their parents and thrusts a phone in one of his friends face to call them immediately. At another point, he was arguing with his would be killer, Dan White about why this was personal and not just another issue for him. To make his arguments about why gays should come out would've made the film more compelling if they would've showed his struggles with secrecy in his early life. Instead, we see Milk, (played well by Sean Penn) having one note throughout the film. There is no arc to his character. Not many changes occur and as a film lover, I want to see those arcs. It makes for better story telling.Harvey Milk was a politician and one of the main segments of the film was devoted to his being against Proposition 6 (the attempt to ban gay schoolteachers from public schools) which did not pass. It's hard not to be reminded of the current controversial passing of Prop 8(the restriction of marriage by same sex couples) as its backdrop. Sean Penn in his acceptance speech railed against it, but I found it odd that he was not in the DVD extras talking about playing Milk. And speaking of the acting.Sean Penn in the lead role, certainly looked the part. His dialect seemed to go in and out at times into areas that reminded me of his character in I Am Sam. Overall, he did a good job but at times, it was hard to sense how he felt, as it seemed he was focused too much on mannerisms than emotions. I think Sean Penn is an excellent actor, but I did not find this to be one of his strongest roles and was saddened he lost the Oscar to Mickey Rourke. Others in the cast include James Franco who was solid as Scott Smith, Milks' long time lover and first campaign manager. However, Emilie Hirsch was sorely out of place as the great advocate Cleve Jones (who was the creator of the AIDS Quilt). I found his performance to be over his head and at times, he seemed to be play acting. I had no feeling about him at all. It was as if he didn't take the role seriously enough, at least to my perspective. Diego Luna plays Jack, the jilted, abandoned lover who goes over the edge when Harvey does not meet his excessively needy demands for attention. This role has been done many times in many films and nothing new was really added to this type of role. It seemed to have just been thrown together to add some form of angst but I didn't buy it. Josh Brolin does a decent job of Dan White (Milk and Mayor Moscone's assassin) but I did not find him to be utterly believable or his role as being clear either. However, I did find the character of State Senator Briggs, played by Denis O'Hare to be truthful and someone that exuded disgust which was palpable. I was expecting better performances from an Oscar Nominated Best Picture contender. Just makes me bitter that Synecdoche, NY was not given much consideration.Gus Van Sant does a good job at directing. I still think his early works like Drugstore Cowboy and Good Will Hunting (my personal favorite of his work) to be much stronger films. But, Milk is a good film to watch. It always feels good about seeing someone fight for equality and basic civil rights that are guaranteed us all. The world is a better place for people like Harvey Milk to have been in it. http://tbreviewer.blogspot.com/",6,7,12,12 March 2009
Watchmen," The Watchmen Has a Lot of Promise But Ultimately Can't Live Up to Expectations
","Zach Snyder's ambitious rendering of Alan Moore's brilliant graphic novel The Watchmen has a little something for everyone but left me ultimately dissatisfied. That isn't to say the film isn't visually stunning. It is, and considering Zach Snyder made 300, that aspect shouldn't surprise anyone. However, the film is not the socio-political, apocalyptic statement that I was hoping would bear some resemblance to the graphic novel on which it is based. There is a reason that Alan Moore refused to have his name associated with the film.In a nutshell, the complex, multi layered stories-within-stories plot is about an ex superhero who is murdered and one of his ex partners, a masked inkblot named Rorschach sets out to track his killer by trying to enlist his former superhero friends, who were known as Watchmen. The film is enjoyable to watch for the first 2/3 and then it descends into camp and clich√©d dialogue and circumstance. Not unlike other comic book films. From an acting perspective, there are 2 standouts. Jeffrey Dean Morgan who plays the ironic and cruel Comedian and a really well portrayed sociopathic but justice bound Rorschach played by Jackie Earle Haley of Little Children. I found that the Rorschach character was the most short changed out of all of the em and he was my favorite. The cast also features: Malin Ackerman as the sexy but troubled Silk Spectre II (who is the unlucky girlfriend of Dr. Manhattan); Patrick Wilson as the awkward and shut in Night Owl II; Billy Crudup as the very Blue, time and space bending unemotional Dr. Manhattan; (excellent cgi on Doc, right down to being anatomically correct) and Matthew Goode as the smartest person in the world but at what cost, Ozymandias.Each Watchmen's origin is explored, some more than others. They represent the anti-superhero. Completely distinct from Batman and Spider-Man. They are incredibly flawed and dispense justice as they see fit. Some Watchmen are no different from common vigilantes. The film, like the novel is set in an alternate reality in 1985. Where Richard Nixon is still president, the US wins the Vietnam War, with Dr. Manhattan's help and the threat of nuclear annihilation is close at hand with the Soviet Union. For the most part, this is one of the more faithful books to screen adaptations I have seen, but they made some major tweaks to the climax, which I didn't have too much trouble with but true fanboys will hate it. Some of the more memorable lines from the novel are featured which made me smile, especially from Rorschach. But the other characters appear wooden and their dialogue for the most part is uninteresting. Dr. Manhattan as in the novel for me is the most sympathetic character as he was a noted physicist who is turned into the blue doc, due to a experiment gone horribly wrong, where essentially his molecules are turned inside out, blown apart and then reassembled. But, along with the other Watchmen, I found I didn't have any feeling about any of them and their circumstances, as their stories were thrown together. Again, I can't fault Mr. Snyder or the screenwriter Alex Tse too much. This was a herculean feat that they pulled off, where many visionaries like Darren Aronofsky and Terry Gilliam failed. However, it plays too much to the crowd more interested in violence and sex than good characterization and even good acting. I can't count how many times I was asking the characters how they felt about their circumstance, particularly a scene involving Manhattan and Silk Spectre II on Mars. The only clarity came from Rorschach and Comedian. Kudos to Mr. Haley and Mr. Morgan in that regard.Overall, fanboys, I predict will enjoy their long awaited masterpiece but will be ultimately disappointed. And for those who are unfamiliar with the novel will like it even less and will undoubtedly get lost in the intricacies of the plot.",6,8,16,6 March 2009
District 9," These Illegal Aliens Can Stay
","For most of the year there have been trailers and promos for a unique looking film called District 9 that is produced by Peter Jackson. A buzz was rightfully generated as the trailers show a colony of shrimp looking aliens that happen to appear over Johannesburg, South Africa and end up in a slum designated as District 9 and the problems that ensue because of the visitors. But would the film deliver? Boy, does it ever. Forget Transformers, Harry Potter, (I wouldn't go near GI Joe). District 9 is the original sci- fi hit of the summer. It's the best film next to Hurt Locker, Julie and Julia for an otherwise average selection of summer movies. Feels like the summer of 2008 was a long time ago.District 9 takes place 20 years after the aliens (which are derogatorily called Prawns) appear. They do not live in harmony with humans as a nice montage of the past 20 years shows us. It's actually a great metaphor for the immigration problem and more directly for South Africa itself...Apartheid. But, a government agency called MNU (Multi-National United), has decided to uproot the aliens and put them in a more confined area, more akin to a concentration camp. Leading the efforts for evicting the aliens is a dorky kind of bureaucrat named Wikus van der Merwe. While going from shack to shack Wikus gets exposed to a strange alien chemical substance that is concocted by the alien protagonist Christopher Johnson. Here the film turns into a Kafkaesque adventure where Wikus with the help of his only two 'Prawn' friends, Christopher and his son are in a race against time to put things right...for both species.District 9 comes to us from unknown Director, Neil Blomkamp, who also hails from Johannesburg, South Africa. He certainly has a great love for sci-fi films as all through District 9, you can spot homages to such films as Aliens, RoboCop, Star Wars, Independence Day, etc. He keeps the action steadily flowing in the all too prevalent documentary style of shooting, which is a lot kinder to the senses than Cloverfield. A pleasant surprise was the acting of also unknown actor Sharlto Copley, as Wikus. He truthfully brings out the imaginary circumstances that he is under without forcing or doing much indicating. He displays a nice range of varying emotions throughout the film as his character has a very interesting arc. For the most part, the rest of the acting is well done. The film is not without it's flaws and one certainly has to suspend much disbelief but despite the films' flaws, the story remains solid and the end result is science fiction fun that I highly recommend.",8,3,6,29 August 2009
Gran Torino," Dirty Harry Tells Kids to Get Off His Lawn
","Clint Eastwood's last performance as an actor (so he says) could've been worse. Gran Torino is not on par with his other recent masterpieces like Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby or Changeling but it has heart. Clint as Walt Kowalski looks and acts like Dirty Harry in his golden days yelling at kids to get off his lawn, but with much more of a mean, bigoted streak. But, slowly he changes his ways thanks to a Hmong family that has moved in next door, being terrorized by a gang of Hmong thugs. He especially takes to Thao, their teenage son, whom he catches trying to steal his prized Gran Torino. Clint's character arcs in a positive way and although he maintains his racial epithets, we find they are terms of endearment. He uses them on everyone he knows. Clint's acting is sharp throughout the film, this isn't exactly a new character for him, only more seasoned and willingness to be open. A good metaphor for society in general. Not sure if the Hmong actors are new but they are rough around the edges. The best of the bunch is Sue (Ahney Her). Aside from predictable moments, it is a good film.",7,1,7,11 June 2009
The Hurt Locker," A Worthy Depiction of Being on the Front Lines in Iraq
","There have been more then several films concerning the Iraq War and most of them are forgettable. But Kathryn Bigelow has given us a worthwhile film about an elite bomb squad in Baghdad in 2004. After their team leader is killed trying to defuse a roadside bomb, the men of Bravo Company must learn to deal with their new charming, but reckless team leader Sergeant James, who instantly becomes an irritation to Sergeant JT Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge as he shows his new team a different kind of urban combat.Miss Bigelow takes us into the lives of these men who risk their lives every day in a hostile environment where you don't know who you can trust and all you have is each other, regardless of your differences. This is not your typical all testosterone driven war film that glorifies war, nor is it a heavy anti war message film. Although, there is a scene where there clearly is alpha male competition going on which looked truthful and had the right amount of comedy that wasn't over the top. The film simply is an effective depiction of life on the front lines, forming a tenuous camaraderie, trying to connect with your humanity and what happens when your rotation is over to some of these brave soldiers.There is very good acting in the film and some interesting choices for cameos. Guy Pearce has a small but important scene as the first team leader, Sergeant Thompson and his scene makes a point of showing the difference in his leadership style and bomb disposal method as opposed to James. David Morse has a brief but charismatic stint as a Colonel Reed, who's confrontation with James leaves you guessing. Ralph Fiennes even shows up as a no nonsense military contractor in the field. But the 3 main actors, Anthony Mackie as Sanborn, Jeremy Renner as James and Brian Geraghty as Eldridge form a distinct trio. Renner is an atypical squad leader with a subtle intensity. His bit of business about the souvenirs he picks up along the way gives his character clarity. Mackie plays Sanborn as a tough, by the book sergeant who has a lot going on under the surface and his frustration and even his envy is quite clear. His underlying question of does he have what it takes is a driving force in his characterization and his heartfelt speech about the state of things is well done. Geraghty as Eldridge is not as strong as his compadres but his characterization as the emotionally fragile, unsure of himself specialist is decent enough and it works with the story.With the Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow's realistic depiction of the lives of Iraqi soldiers is poignant and harrowing. She keeps the action flowing, even during the 'down' time periods. I wish she would've shown a little more of the guys after their deployment ends, except for just a brief albeit telling scene with James. But, that didn't take away from the effectiveness of her spot on direction. I predict she will be recognized come Awards season.",8,2,5,9 August 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A Wonderful Fable That Doesn't Excite Enough
","This week, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button has come out on DVD and Blu Ray. David Fincher's tale of a man who ages backwards and the adventures and lessons that he learns along the way. Based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald and adapted by Eric Roth (who also wrote Forrest Gump which I'll get to later). Benjamin's story is told through his diary to Daisy (Cate Blanchett), an elderly woman on the verge of death by her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond). This film looks like a labor of love by Fincher and Brad Pitt who stars as the backwards aging Benjamin. We share Benjamin's life from his birth as an old man, all the way back to his infancy. What we experience is an unconventional love story that is held together by Cate Blanchett's superb work and Brad Pitt's lack thereof. There are other great performances as well by Taraji Henson, Tilda Swinton and briefly, Elias Koteas. But they are not enough to make this a great film.There are a lot of metaphors incorporated through the film and they all seem to be centered on the affect that time has on all of our lives. I found the prevailing themes of redemption and live life to its fullest as the primary message which could be construed as corny but I found comforting. The ever present refrain of 'You never know what's comin for ya.' is spoken throughout the film and is a warning to us all. Hurricane Katrina is also a very visceral metaphor in the film and it seems to embody that mantra. Essentially, nothing lasts, but it's choice as a metaphor for this film is...well...curiousA lot of great special effects were used to depict Benjamin from birth until about half way into the film when the real Brad finally shows up. All throughout, Benjamin's voice is narrating to us, sharing his adventures and his simple wisdom for us all. It is because of this that the film has a Forrest Gump like quality and especially Brad's accent and voice inflection is very similar to Tom Hanks who played Gump (I've seen Forest Gump and you Mr. Button are no Forest Gump). Whether it was a conscious or unconscious choice is irrelevant, I personally thought it sounded forced and as we like to say in the acting world, indicated. That is not to say that his acting is bad overall but he seemed to focus too much on his accent and not enough on his the spine of his character. But, to his credit, there are times when he does a decent job of finding the emotional reality of the character, except for a few scenes which his lack of emotion is glaring. The scenes with Julia Ormond staying with Blanchett as she is dying didn't do much for me. I enjoyed Blanchett's elderly characterization but I found Ormond to not have clarity about her character which left me feeling nothing about her relationship and how she really felt about her dying mother. The Cinematography by Claudio Miranda is outstanding. I just love the way the shots were framed and the wonderful use of color. One of my favorite shots is in an elevator with Tilda Swinton...sumptuous.The film deservedly received 3 Oscars for Art Direction, Visual Effects and of course, Makeup. I agree that it should not have won Best Picture but the film's message of seizing life was beautiful and especially as I am entering a turning point in my life, just passing 40, the point is quite powerful for me. I commend David Fincher, (who is a great director) for creating a modern fable and trying to bring magic back into movies. I just wish there was more magical moments to enjoy. But, I was still entertained overall and I give Benjamin 3 out of 5 stars.",7,0,2,8 May 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Getting Dragged to Hell is an Awful Experience
","Drag Me to Hell written and directed by Sam Raimi is to put it bluntly...Awful. I have to say that when I heard Sam Raimi was taking a break from Spider Man to go back to directing his first true horror film since Army of Darkness, I was looking forward to it. Then when I saw the trailers and now the film, I feel like telling Sam to stick, with Spider Man for now because he's lost his horror movie directing edge.A tale of bad things happen to good people is taken to the extreme when a sweet, innocent loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) fails to give an extension on a mortgage to a decrepit gypsy woman Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver), Mrs Ganush decides to put a hex on sweet little Christine whereby a demon will come to...you know, the title gives it away, unless she can find a way to reverse the curse. She sets out doing this with the help from her ever so accommodating boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long) and a psychic medium Rham Jas (Dileep Rao).The film is boring, full of horror clich√©s that are not scary and the laughs are not that funny. There is one scene featuring embalming fluid that was pretty funny, I'll give it that. The key ingredient missing in this film was Bruce Campbell not having a cameo, which would've provided needed comic relief. The acting is sorely lacking. Alison Lohman just doesn't live truthfully under any of the given and imaginary circumstances that befall her. She certainly didn't have a feeling about what was happening to her. Don't get me started on Justin Long. He simply looks clueless and I am just not sure why he is so popular. He looks like he is sleep walking through the film. I will say that Dileep Rao brings some sort of depth to his character as the medium and there are times when I felt something from him. Lorna Raver does a good job as the hexing gypsy woman but unfortunately neither she nor Dileep can save the film.As for Sam Raimi, I was expecting more from the horror maven. This is a boring and sloppy film. I felt cheated. He essentially rigs up a lot of the same cheap gimmicks from the Evil Dead series into this mind numbing story. It was disappointing because it feels like Sam just needed something to do while waiting to make Spider Man 4. If you are a fan of mainstream horror that lacks any depth or thrills than this is the film for you. Otherwise, save your money.",2,4,12,1 June 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A Little More Than Meets the Eye
","Those pesky transforming bots are back in Michael Bay's sequel to the successful Transformers. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. This time, the Decepticons are on a mission to kidnap Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBouf) when after a freak accident, Sam discovers the truth about the origins of the Transformers as they plot to find a sacred energy source and use it to destroy Earth;s primary source of energy. It is up to Optimus Prime and the Autobots to once again save the day with a little help from their human friends.Michael Bay is roundly criticized for the all action fluff he makes and a lot of it is deserved (Pearl Harbor anyone). But, with the Transformers series he has made heavy action laden films that are pretty decent. Teen and pre-teen boys will absolutely go crazy over this sequel. It is loaded with amazing effects and loads of action sequences. Not to mention Megan Fox, who is all sex kitten but at least she knows that is what she is there for. This is not fine art we're dealing with when the producers are Hasbro, so there is a lot of suspension of disbelief with this film. There are an awful lot of plot holes that Mr. Bay seems to be content with letting go. Like, how did Shia get medical attention in the middle of the desert for his broken arm. And, if the whole world is threatened, why is it just the US who takes on the Decepticons? If you can get past these 2 of many examples of plot holes and take the film for the popcorn friendly action flick it is meant to be you will be entertained. Clocking in at 144 minutes, I was surprised at how entertaining it was, with minimal boring moments.Shia LaBouf is slowly transforming (no pun intended) into a solid actor. He plays the part of Sam truthfully and really lets us believe he is experiencing these extraordinary things that happen to him, with honest responses. It is refreshing to see a young actor not go through the motions in a CGI effects laden film. John Turturro is good as usual. He reprises his role as Agent Simmons and has some genuinely funny moments. However, there is also a major plot hole around him as well. Also, reprising their roles are Sam's parent's. Kevin Dunn who plays Sam's dad does a good job connecting with Shia and in one specific moment, you really believe he is afraid for his son. The same cannot be said for Julie White as Sam's mom, except for a cute sequence on Sam's college campus. Ramon Rodriquez stars as Sam's college roommate Leo, who is a conspiracy nut and a fraidy cat and he plays that up pretty well and he does provide some needed comic relief. All the soldiers do a decent job of being truthful in their circumstance as well. Reprising their voice overs for the main Transformers are Hugo Weaving as evil Megatron and Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime. Both sound good as ever.The love scenes between Megan and Shia are the only thing that feels strained at times and thankfully there attempt at love scenes are kept to a minimum. Mr. Bay knows what the audience wants and rarely disappoints delivering the goods. There also seemed to be an homage to Gremlins which was silly and the relationship between Megatron and The Fallen oddly resembled the Sith in the Star Wars series. 2 new twin Autobots were introduced which have been getting criticized for being racially tinged as they jive talk and always get into scraps and one confesses to not being able to read. I think they were harmless. At times they fell flat but other times they were funny. All in all Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is action packed decent fun.",7,37,69,25 June 2009
The Reader," The Reader Was an Emotionally Manipulative Snoozefest
","Former Nazi SS officer learns that reading is fundamental. That should be the tag line for The Weinstein Brothers Oscar nominated film: The Reader, featuring Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes. It is the story of an emotionally constipated man, Michael Berg (Fiennes), who cannot open up to anyone and it is all because of an affair he had with an older woman, Hannah Schmitz (Winslet) when he was 15 and she broke his heart. The affair was torrid and in between sex romps, the boy would read to the woman and it acted as a kind of aphrodisiac for her. The affair lasted one summer in the late 1950's in W. Germany. The film than moves on to the meat of the story, when several years later, the young man goes to law school and he is taken on a field trip to see a trial of former SS guards from Auschwitz who are on trial and it turns out Hannah is one of the guards on trial and he is shocked. With Hannah's fate in the balance, will she make a decision to protect her pride rather than her life. Michael has information that could affect the outcome of the trial and will he use it to protect his long lost love. These are the supposed harrowing questions that we should be made to care about. But I for one did not.I was bored watching this film. There's no guts to it. The courtroom scenes were slow and contrived. Too much talking. I can only say Director Stephen Daldrey is to blame. Film is a visual medium afterall. I can go on but I'll just finish the review discussing the acting. I was uninspired by Kate Winslet (who is a very good actress) and after all the Oscar talk about her being a shoe-in to receive the Oscar for Best Actress for this performance, I couldn't wait to see ho much better it had to be than Revolutionary Road, which I believe she should've been nominated for instead (also a boring film by the way). I felt she didn't really believe in her character. Her accent was uninspired and at times she would give a glimpse of emotion but it was fleeting, particularly one scene in the courtroom. Granted this is a provocative role, especially with the sex scenes with the young Michael but her character, like Michael is stunted emotionally. I didn't feel she had much going on underneath to make her stoicism palatable. Neither did I find Ralph Fiennes (another excellent actor) performance all that good either. Actually, the only actor I enjoyed watching was Lena Olin who plays a Holocaust survivor. Bruno Ganz who plays Michael's law professor was equally disappointing. I usually like Bruno's work, but I felt like he was indicating and forcing his lines. So, we have a pretty sound cast, in a wasted effort. The whole film feels contrived and emotionally manipulating due to its subject matter. Once again, we have a film that forces German guilt on to us. I have a strong feeling about this, after vacationing in Berlin last spring and seeing how much the Germans still berate themselves for the war. The nation should be prescribed Prozac in my opinion. The Holocaust was a tragic, horrible and an unthinkable blight on humanity , but the fact that substandard films about this subject continue to be revered by the Academy virtually every year grows tiresome to me. The fact that The Dark Knight or even The Wrestler was passed over for The Reader is ridiculous. I am hoping Meryl Streep or Angelina Jolie gets Best Actress next week.",3,18,36,18 February 2009
The Wrestler," Acting Doesn't Get Any Better Than The Wrestler
","Darren Aronofsky's latest triumph, The Wrestler, is a poignant tragedy about a man who can only function inside of a wrestling ring and not in the real world. Mickey Rourke portrays 'Randy the Ram' a once was on the wrestling circuit 20 years past and he is still trapped in the 80's. As many have accurately reported, Rourke, gives a tour de force performance that eerily seems to mirror his real life. His acting is top notch, relaxed and unforced. A great example of this is a scene where the Ram is working in a deli counter at an Acme supermarket. Marissa Tomei, who plays Cassidy, a veteran stripper who is re evaluating her life and career choice. Marissa also is making a comeback of sorts like Mickey and she too, plays Cassidy with stark realism and honesty. Not to mention, she does not use a body double in the scenes in the strip club and she looks fantastic. Evan Rachel Wood, rounds out the cast as the Ram's estranged daughter Stephanie. Wood plays Stephanie, who is abandoned by Ram, who is trying to get back into her life with the right degree of hostility but there is a moment where I felt the relationship was not believable, but it was a fleeting moment.Overall, I absolutely Love this film. I loved the parallel relationship between the Ram and Cassidy, where both are characters in a fantasy world and seeing the Ram ironically, not realizing that and pursues Cassidy strongly, when Cassidy refuses to cross the boundary of dating customers is sad to watch. It is also interesting to see the juxtaposition of the Ram who plays the hero (or the Face) in the ring turns out to be a heel when it comes to his daughter, but still it is hard not to root for him, because he is a nice guy. However, what was the most compelling to me was when the Ram is forced into making a life change working at Acme after suffering a severe heart attack after a particularly grueling match, (which is brutal to watch and expertly filmed by Mr. Aronofsky) in a parallel with his wrestling days, he is seen walking through the back of the supermarket as we slowly hear the build up of a cheering crowd and he stops to pause in front of the (heavy plastic) curtain and when he enters the deli, the noise suddenly comes to a halt. It just makes the tragedy that much clearer.Darren Aronofsky continues to shine as one of America's top film makers. The Wrestler, his 4th feature is shot in a gritty, true independent cinema verite style, which feels like we're watching a documentary. I give The Wrestler 5 stars and urge all to go see it. And for you actors out there, you will really appreciate the performances.",9,0,0,18 February 2009
Defiance," A Good Film About a Lesser Known Story
","Defiance is a good adaptation of a little known story of Jewish brothers hiding out in the Belorussian forests fighting Nazi's and their collaborators. All the whole, they save the lives of escaping Jews. Starring Daniel Craig (taking a break in between Bond films), Liev Schreiber (so good to see him in something more substantial than Wolverine where he clearly looked like he hated that experience) and Jamie Bell as the fighting Bielski brothers.It's not a great film, as it is fairly predictable at spots and Daniel Craig generally playing one emotion for the majority of the film. It is effective and it is nice to see a film about the Jews in World War 2 who are not just lambs for slaughter for a change. I did enjoy seeing the struggles of the fugitive Jews to retain their humanity while hiding out in the forests. Edward Zwick does well in his direction. I give Defiance 3 out of 5 stars.",7,5,11,4 June 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Not as Good as All the Hype...But Good Nonetheless
","Slumdog is a good film overall, but I did not understand the massive hype surrounding it. It is not one of my favorite films from 2008. However, in terms of all the Oscar nominees it was the Best Picture of that group. The film centers around Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) who is accused of cheating while being a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. He is sent to police headquarters where he is subsequently tortured into revealing who helped him and why (apparently in India, you are treated like a terrorist for cheating on game shows). This leads to Jamal regaling his captors with stories from his past that coincide with each question that he answered correctly. As a child, Jamal befriends a beautiful girl Latika (Frieda Pinto) and he falls in love. However, his brother Salim, who doesn't hesitate to betray Jamal at every turn keeps ruining his chances with Latika and makes her vanish from his life. But Jamal vows to find her and save her. One of the main reasons he becomes a contestant on the show, so he hopes she will be watching. The film culminates with Jamal being released from police custody to go and try to answer the final question for 20 million rupees, where in an attempt to phone a friend, gets the surprise of his life.There are some aspects of the film that are clich√©d and confusing to me. My favorite parts of the film were the sequences of the main characters as children and the horrific things they have to endure to get by on the streets of Mumbai. Danny Boyle is an exceptional director and once again he does a good job with the source material. The acting was decent as most of the child actors I believe have never been actors before, so they did a pretty good job. It is worth seeing but again, I don't think it was earth shattering.",7,2,5,4 April 2009
Valkyrie," A Good Film but Not Great, Thanks to Tom Cruise
","Valkyrie, available this week on DVD and Blu-Ray is based on actual events concerning a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler at the height of WWII by his own officers. Bryan Singer's film is a fast paced suspenseful thriller that feels like a plot from Mission Impossible. The star studded film keeps the action going and even intriguing even for those that know the history of the failed assassination attempt. However, it's not enough to try to kill Hitler but you also have to plan to take over the government and here is where some of the finer scenes of the film take place in the frenetic chase between the conspirators and the loyal Nazi party members eager to stamp out the traitors. The film does a good job of being clear as to why these particular men wanted to overthrow the Nazi regime and restore Germany's tattered reputation in the world.The main problem for me is the lack of German accents or language in the film. We are basically seeing the whole internal battle of German soldiers/politicians and their Nazi counterparts all played by mostly British and American actors, led by Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. Now, a lot of negative feedback has been given about Mr. Cruise's performance and I cannot disagree with a lot of it. He appeared to be a boy surrounded by men and was certainly not the strongest actor of any scene he was in when compared with Kenneth Branaugh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson and Terence Stamp. OK, he was better than Eddie Izzard, but not by much. He seemed to just be reciting his lines with no connection or feeling behind them and when feeling did come out, it felt forced and rarely could I feel him having clarity about the person he was portraying, who happens to be a German hero. All these fine veteran actors were living out their circumstances meaningfully. I was not impressed by the few lines of German spoken by Mr. Cruise at the opening of the film but then we hear good old English the rest of the way. I mean why bother? There wasn't even any German accents, with the exception of two; David Bamber as Hitler and Thomas Kretschmann as Major Otto van Remer.Aside, from that, this is a good film that is worth seeing. The writing was crisp and engaging, while Bryan Singer's direction was sure and confident. It's a pity that Tom Cruise could not catapult this film to be great, but then again, that is a rare occurrence.",7,1,3,21 May 2009
