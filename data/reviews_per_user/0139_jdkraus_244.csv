The King's Speech," Though bio-pic films tend to hog the Oscars, I hope this film does well at the academy.
","Every year, there seems to be a wide release of bio-pics which tend hog the Academy Awards attention. They almost always become a default for winning the big awards. Just look at the last five years of Oscar history. Without a doubt, 'The King's Speech' is certain for Oscar bait. I initially went to view this movie so to see if it is really award worthy material. From start to finish, my eyes were glued to screen. This movie is excellent on so many levels. The performances are simply phenomenal. I have never had the privilege in seeing a movie with Colin Firth. His role as King George VI is sublime. Not only does he pull off a good stutter and deliver his lines well, but he puts intense emotion in the character he portrays, whether it be the unyielding fear that he experiences in giving speeches to the anguish he faces within the various tragedies of his family. No doubt, he'll get Best Actor, and rightfully so. Helena Bonham Carter provides warmth and humor as King George's wife. The real genius though is Geoffery Rush. I've seen his mesmerizing work for Shine, and I consider him to be among Europe's most versatile actors. Every second he is on screen in this film, he creates an illumination, whether it be the witty dialog or the advisable council he delivers to the King. I'd give him my vote for Best Supporting Actor. Addition to the brilliant cast, the story itself is unique and the fact that it is based off of diaries and notes from the actual people that are depicted in this film is incredible. David Seidler will definitely get his award for Best Original Screenplay. The film-making talent in this film is flawless. One aspect I can't help but admire is the work of the cinematography. Each shot in this film is composed and lighted beautifully. The costumes and production design is exquisite, the editing crisp, and the sound perfect. Alexandre Desplat's score adds a pretty tune to the film, but the real impact is the use of classical music, which is particularly significant towards the end of the film where the King gives his first WWII speech over the radio. And the directionÂ…shall I continue? If I have to say one negative thing about this film, it is the pace. The two-hour film moves more like a three hour film. This is a common thread in bio-pic films since only so much can be covered in a limited time, which makes it hard to choose what to keep and what to toss while trying to keep the audience entertained. This is a hard feat to pull off; nevertheless, my eyes were focused on the screen the whole time. I have not seen many great films this year. 'The King's Speech' is one of them. Though bio-pic films tend to hog the Oscars, I hope this film does well at the academy.My rating: ****/****",10,1,3,24 February 2011
The Avengers," What I want in a super hero flick!
","'The Avengers' is not an average action flick. In fact, it is an excellent one. The success of this film relies not only on the spectacular visual effects and sustained action sequences, but mostly on the characters and the interactions between them. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, the Hulk, and Hawkeye are treat to watch as they kick ass, exchange clever one-liners, and desperately work together to fight off Loki and his minions. Each actor portrays their character with zeal and believability. We don't just see Robert Downey Jr. sarcastic nature or the ripped biceps of Chris Evans. We see Tony Stark/Iron Man and Captain America saving the world from certain demise. As a result, we find ourselves cheering them on! This is what makes a great super hero flick! RDJ does get most of the lines, but he does not steal the show entirely from the other characters for they have a chance to develop too.For nearly a 2 hour and 30 minute film, 'The Avengers' flies by. The action scenes are not just big explosions and blatant CGI (one sequence in particular is reminiscent to the destruction of Chicago in Transformers: Dark of the Moon), but there are several one-on-one fights with the super heroes and the villain. Not trying to give any spoilers, but the fight between Thor and The Hulk is a true, visual effects feast and a well-choreographed sequence. Some of the action scenes are very long, but unlike the last few Michael Bay films, I found myself begging for more. The plot is nothing special or too memorable. However, it is easy to follow Anyone who has not seen some of the other action films (ex: Thor, Captain America, Iron Man) will not be confused, for the scriptwriters made 'The Avengers' a film of its own, and not a crossover of the other features. It is worth noting that the writers also pack a lot of witty and sometimes unpredictable humor into the mix. To sum up, 'The Avengers' is the best super hero flick I have seen years. It has everything I ask for in the genre.",10,1,4,4 May 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," I liked it as much as its prequel
","Most movie sequels aren't as good as its prequel. My original expectations for a sequel to National Treasure were not very high. To my surprise, National Treasure: Book of Secrets was every as good as the first one.The all-star cast returns as the lovable and heroic characters. Nicholas Cage is back as the determined treasure hunter Benjamin Gates. Justin Bartha is Cage's sidekick as the amusing and comical computer geek Riley and Diane Kruger is the attractive, but estranged Abigail Chase. The rest of the supporting cast was also a nice addition to the film, including: Jon Voight, Harvey Keitel, Ed Harris, Bruce Greenwood, and Helen Mirren.Like the original one, there are great car chases and suspenseful journeys into the location of the new treasure. It was a great popcorn loving film; however, like the first one, the story was unbelievable and unrealistic. It was interesting, but I couldn't help but find it all silly. Nonetheless, I liked the two hour diversion. I can now see these movies as the modern-day generation of the next Indiana Jones'. 8/10 There's evidence at the end of this movie that there could very well be a third National Treasure. I will be looking forward to it.",8,1,3,3 January 2008
Angels & Demons," Despite its flaws and alternatives from the book, it delivers
","Probably like the millions of people worldwide, I read Dan Brown's novel 'Angels and Demons' after reading and seeing 'The Da Vinci Code.' Both novels are excellent and Ron Howard's adaptation off of 'The Da Vinci code' is probably among the best I have seen. Impressed by 'The Da Vinci's Code' success, I expected an equally as a great film for its prequel.'Angels and Demons' is accurate to the novel, but not nearly as I hoped. The book would have made for a three-hour film and I am glad that the filmmakers were able to fit it into a 2 hour and 18 minute film, which flies by. Nevertheless, because it is a movie, it leaves some important twists and subplots out as well as a significant character from the book and an alternate beginning and ending. I don't mind the additions, they were okay, but in my opinion, they did not fit the story as well as the book. For one, not giving too much away, the assassin, who's going on the rampage against the Catholic Church, played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas is a far different villain than in the book. Yes, he's a cold-blooded killer, but he lacks the venom to make a believable villain. I did not despise him like Paul Bettany's wonderful work as Silas in 'The Da Vinci'. The villain's comeuppance in the movie is also feeble compared to the novel, which in the book is quite intense.The other performances in the film, however, are great. Tom Hanks dazzles as Professor Langdon, Ayelet Zurer is both gorgeous and stunning as Victoria, and Stellan Skarsgard, as usual, plays a real hard ass as Commander Richter. But the real genius that drives the movie is Ewan McGregor as the Camerlengo. I have a feeling that he won't receive an Oscar nomination, but I'll keep my fingers crossed. It's also nice that Armin Mueller-Stahl is in another film. He's up there in age, but he delivers his lines fluently and brilliantly, as he does in every film I have seen him in. Salvortine Totino's cinematography is beautiful and Hans Zimmer's score is awesome. I will point out that the score has a little bit of 'The Da Vinci Code' rendition, but it nonetheless delivers. The other visual works such as: costumes, set design, and visual effects are also lavish. But like many people on the IMDb board, there is the question on its PG-13 rating. Having read the book, it would have made a solid R. Yet, the movie does not cut out much in terms of violence from the novel. I'm not a squeamish person, but much of the violent content in this film was surprisingly shocking and gruesome. I wonder if the MPAA has become lazy when it comes to the rating system. Then again, 'Angels and Demons' has hardly any swearing and nudity, which often makes an immediate R versus just containing violence. I don't know, but in my opinion, it deserved the R rating, and I've seen movies that are rated R for violence and they are nowhere near the leagues of this film. Despite its flaw and alternatives from the book, it delivers. My rating: *** out of ****",8,1,3,18 June 2009
Black Swan," Aronofsky+Portman=...I don't know what
","Two names drew me to this movie. Darren Aronofsky and Natalie Portman. Aronofsky has made some very unique films and Portman is a fine actress. But that does not mean both will be a great movie. The story is simple. It is about a ballerina (Portman) who is obsessed with being the best performer, or in this case, being the Black Swan. Full of out-there characters, strange camera techniques/special effects, bizarrely, disturbing hallucinations, and a character driven to self-destruction, this movie reeks as a masterpiece by Aronofsky. What could go wrong? The problem? There are many. For starters, it is too reminiscent of Requiem for a Dream. About a third of the movie is nothing more than the ballerina's crazy delusions of her flesh and nails peeling off, faces in pictures mocking at her, and even conversations with other characters that never happen. While I enjoy such off the wall stuff, it is in excess and feels out of place for the film's plot. It is as if Aronofsky wanted to throw in craziness as a means to entertain or rather shock the viewer. The artsy film fans will love it but it is a put off for the average viewer. I don't mind it. It is just overbearing. It makes sense for such bizarre delusions to occur in a film about drug abuse like Requiem for a Dream, but not about a ballerina dancer. After awhile, you cannot help wonder if Portman's character is a psychotic. The second problem with this film is that it lacks characters we care to see succeed. Aronofsky pulled this off marvelously in The Fountain and even Requiem for a Dream to an extent, but this is non-existent in The Black Swan. Third, supporting number 2, the performances were not that encompassing. Portman won the golden globe, the BAFTA, the Screen Actor's Guild, and the Oscar for this film. In all honesty, she acted mostly with a tear-stained face that is as memorable as a girl about to killed in a b-horror movie. I am not a Natalie Portman basher. I love her work. But she was not that good in this movie. The fourth problem, it has many scenes that have no relevance to the overall plot. Among them is a love lesbian scene between Portman and Mila Kunis. While this might work in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, it feels contrived for simple shock value (and perhaps maybe an excuse to get young male viewers excited to watch this movie). I could go on and on, but I'll spare you the pain of reading anymore. It is not a complete disaster though. Like all Aronofsky films, it has a haunting score and exquisite cinematography. The dream sequence in the beginning where Portman dances with a male performer that morphs into a monster is a spectacular feat. It is only a three-minute scene, but it is something for me to remember about the movie. The choreography is also very beautiful. Vincent Cassel as the ruthless play director is also very amusing to watch as he grills Portman and the other girls to do better. He delivers as the chauvinistic pig very well. I tried to watch this movie with an open-mind, but it is not my cup of tea.",4,3,7,25 May 2013
Changeling," Potential for Oscars
","Changeling' is almost what the trailers reveal; a woman (Angelina Jolie) comes home one day from work and finds that her son is missing. Several months later, he is found by the LAPD, but the boy is not her kid. When she tells the police that the kid is not her son, they say she's crazy and then she is tossed into a mental institution. This though is only a thin slice of the cake. The film is a study of the 1920s on police corruption as well as ties in a disturbing true event that happened in California around this time period. Clint Eastwood captures this era wonderfully with the aid of authentic set designs and a muted color tone, (which reminds me much of Conrad L. Hall's cinematography for 'Road to Perdition'), which also aids much depth to the look of the time period as well as the dark mood of the story.The performances give a certain illumination to the film, bringing it to life. Of all the movies I have seen, Angelina Jolie gives her best performance that is definitely not shy of an Oscar. She was very engaging and believable, enough for me to feel her character's anguish. John Malkovich also gives a noteworthy performance as the local activist Gustav Briegleb. More great additions come from the children actors. I always find most child actors to be either too rehearsed or just plain bad, but all of them in this movie were very moving and captivating in their roles.The other genius in this film is Clint's direction. I always found him a better director than actor, and he definitely proves that in this film, particularly when it comes to capturing emotion. I won't give away the ending, but I have to mention that one of the most brilliantly directed scenes in this movie is the execution scene. To make the tension believable, he uses a lot of POV shots on the man who is about to be hanged as well as with the victim's family members, which not only drags out the scene to build the suspense, but it also builds emotion. Even though the guy who is about to be hanged is evil, I still feel pity for him. Not many directors could do this, but Clint pulls it off magnificently. The only problem I had with this movie was the pace. The first hour and a half is pretty good, but the remaining forty-five minutes just seemed drawn out and lifeless. The conclusion is inevitable, but in my theater seat I felt it should just get there quicker. Overall, this masterwork by Clint Eastwood has potential for some Oscar recognition.",9,6,10,1 December 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Another fairly decent installment of the 'Pirates' franchise
","One may think that another 'Pirates' film would be terrible, specifically the fact that there's no Keira Knightley or Orlando Bloom, there's a different director, and the idea in it of itself seems insane. Despite these discrepancies, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides', proves to be another decent installment of the series. Once again, Johnny Depp dazzles the screen with his humor, charm, and wit as Captain Jack Sparrow. It's impossible to resist the man in a pirate's outfit with the flawless gold teeth and eye make-up. Geoffrey Rush is simply better than ever as Barbossa (who doesn't need much makeup for the role I might add). Kevin McNally returns as Gibbs as does Keith Richards as Jack's fatherâ€”but only for a mere, somewhat out of place cameo. It may seem disappointing that some of the old faces are gone from the first three films, but the new ones blend in perfectly as replacements. Among them is Penelope Cruz, as Jack's old flame, and Ian MacShane as her evil father Blackbeard. Both do exceptionally well, though Blackbeard is not as up to par as a villain like Davy Jonesâ€”he simply lacks the menace. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides', also proves to have some very memorable action sequences, particularly a chase scene in London (which takes place during the first half hour of the feature). There is also a bit of clever humor that made me laugh almost as hard as the first 'Pirates' film. Rob Marshall proves himself to be fit for the role as the new director of the Pirates films, too. The other technical aspects of CGI, production design, and make up are impeccable.One technical feat that seems lacking is the lighting. It is understandable that it is to be dark during the night, but it did not have to be so dim that I can't tell what is happening on the screen. The plot also did not hold up as good as the earlier films. For instance, I was expecting a big finale like in any other feature. There is one, but it is not long enough, nor is it very memorable. There are also a couple of things left hanging that made me feel confused. Overall though, for a multi-billion dollar series, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' does a pretty good job. It is better than the slow-paced 'Dead Man's Chest', but it is not a masterpiece like the original film. When you have nothing better to do, go see this feature on the big screen. ***/****",8,1,2,22 May 2011
Men in Black 3," Fun to watch, even if it is the third M:I:B
","The success of the first 'Men In Black' mostly relied on the wonderful chemistry between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. The second M:I:B wasn't that great, but the magic between the two actors was enough to keep the film together. A third M:I:B makes one wonder whether another collaboration between Jones and Smith could deliver another nice flick in the series. The answer is yes. The one-liner exchanges and witty humor that the two share is once again fun to watch. This 'Men In Black' does not just rely on the wit of the two stars. There is a surprisingly good story that involves time travel, the 1960s, and a Young Agent K. Josh Brolin plays Young K to the hilt; his mannerisms and blunt attitude are dead-on. Jemaine Clemente does a tour de force as the villain, Boris The Animal. He is a mean, deranged nutjob that kills without a thought and shows no compassion. Like with the Bug in the first film, the make up artists make his appearance look all the more grotesque and menacing. The master in this movie is Michael Stuhlberg as the alien Griffin. His performance reminds me of a savant that is very gifted in foreseeing things. It is hard to not like his character. He has a wit and mild sense of humor that he delivers flawlessly. Like the other M:I:B films, there are good special effects, comedy in the face of destruction, and a new vast array of alien species. The only problem I had with this M:I:B is the gratuitous violence. It is nothing that surpasses the PG-13 rating, but the body count and amount of destruction is much higher than both of the other films combined. And there are some pretty unpleasant scenes involving aliens, specifically in regards to food. This is just a fair warning in case anyone brings popcorn or sodas to their viewing of this movie. You'll never think of fish and dough the same again. M:I:B 3 is a treat to watch. It is better than the second, but it is sacrilegious to say that it beats the original.",8,0,3,8 June 2012
The New World," Look at the scenery, because that's all there is!
","This is probably the most boring movie I have ever seen since A Space Odyssey. I almost fell asleep during the film. The story wasn't carried by the actors; it was shown by pretty images of water and landscapes. I felt like I was looking at a screen full of pretty pictures of nature with the stereo turned up. I do have to admit that many of the shots of nature and the work of cinematography were quite amazing, but that doesn't make a film. A film requires film-making talent, acting, and plot. There is no plot or acting. Yes, there are some famous actors in it like Colin Farrel, Christian Bale, and Christopher Plummer, but they were lucky to say a hundred words. Whenever they got a moment to talk, there voices would trail off and the music would overflow the dialog, making it nearly impossible to hear what they're saying. By the time the movie actually develops story, which is pretty much the love relationship between Pocahontas and John Rolfe, I was already in apathy. The one battle sequence, which is maybe ten minutes long didn't even get me interested. In fact, I found it rather dull compared to the intense action in that Terrence Malick marvelously directed in his The Thin Red Line. This was an art film, fully focused on the scenery and the director of photography's talent. I don't like bashing movies unless it is really horrible. Some people I know like this movie, others don't. I certainly do not like it, but it isn't the worst thing I have seen. because of the cinematography and images, I give it a generous 3/10. -Look at the scenery, because that's all there is!",3,10,15,17 February 2008
Scarface," 'Scarface' is a classical gangster flick, but there is much more to it than meets the eye.
","This is not what many people have built this movie up asâ€”a violent, intense, foul-mouthed, classic gangster picture. 'Scarface' is more than that. Without giving too much of the plot away, the movie is about Tony Montana, a small time crook who dreams of making it to the top. The film very explicitly follows this man's life as he starts in the slums of Florida as a Cuban immigrant with nothing who ends up climbing the ranks to a big drug dealer that owns a mansion. The morals of the plot are the American DreamÂ…for a gangster and how it tears a person apart. 'Scarface' is in a sense a tragedy. A man who gets everything only to destroy what he truly loves. People have regarded Tony Montana as Al Pacino's greatest role. I was somewhat skeptical about this role. I mean, an Italian actor playing a Cuba? C'mon. Yet, he pulls it off brilliantly, even retaining the proper accent. Pacino is completely over the top as Tony. He is brutal, selfish, paranoid, even an addict of the product he sellsâ€”just complete filth. Nevertheless, it is easy to sympathize with his character. No other actor could pull off Tony Montana as good as old Al. Though Pacino makes the movie, he isn't the only great actor in the film. Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Mary Elizabeth Mastratonio make the characters their own. It is easy to either like or despise the characters. Giorgio Moroder's score is simply breathtaking. As soon as I heard his score blast during the opening credits, I knew I was in for a ride. The cinematography by John A Alonzo is very unique; when a scene takes place during the day, it is bright, when it takes place at night, it is very dim. It seems that only natural lighting was used except for the indoor scenes, in which case the only lights present in the scene were used. Some may call this sloppy, but I think it fits the film perfectlyâ€”almost giving it somewhat of a low-budget look. De Palma's work as director could not have been better. This is the perfect film for him to direct, and he did so with finesse. Oliver Stone's script is also excellent. The other aspects of editing, production design, costumes, and even sound are sublime. If I had to say one bad thing about this film, it is the pace. Scarface is a slow moving film with little actionâ€”most of which is saved for the big, bloody finale. This does not make the film boring. The plot and the characters interactions with each other is more than interesting enough to keep the movie going. I thoroughly enjoy this film, and I can definitely see myself viewing it multiple times in the future.My rating: **** out of ****'Scarface' is a classical gangster flick, but there is much more to it than meets the eye.",10,1,4,25 March 2011
Frost_Nixon," Brilliantly executed
","I did not grow up during the Nixon era, so I only know what the history books say. I know about the Watergate 'break-in' and that President Nixon resigned himself from his position due to a 'cover-up' rather than face an impeachment. In a sense, history views him as a crooked politician. The movie 'Frost/Nixon' to my surprise shows almost an unbiased view towards Nixon.The film, as the previews reveal, is about the duel interview between David Frost and Richard Nixon. The movie presents both men as two individuals who seek this interview as an opportunity to broaden their career and credibility. Both have a team of people, made up of brilliant characters who support them and want the one to conquer the other.The duel itself, is very interesting, particularly with the up-close shots that Ron Howard captures wonderfully, as the actors convey their emotions. As I read from reports, the film accurately portrays it for Nixon gives very long answers, trying to dodge the questions while Frost tries to pry and make him say something foolish. In the end, as everyone knows, Frost proves the victor. But it's not the kind of victory where you want to open a bottle of champagne and celebrate. Nixon is flawed, no doubt about it, but he did what he thought was right with both the Vietnam War and the political activism at home. No one knows what went through Nixon's head, as he was president. The film presents him as almost a tragic hero, who tried hard to keep a nation afloat but failed miserably. I personally enjoyed the performances by Sam Rockwell as James Reston Jr. and Kevin Bacon as Jack Brennan because both of them portrayed characters on opposite ends of the spectrum on their view of Nixon and they are willing to go the limits into their political beliefs. Bacon is a stark Republican while Rockwell is a liberal who thinks Nixon should pay for his sins but neither get satisfaction from the interview's result. As for Langella and Sheen both give excellent performances. Langella may very well have given the performance of his life as Nixon. He may not necessarily look like Richard Nixon, but he fills in the role magnificently. I think he is a front row contender for the Oscars. Sheen may also very well earn at least a nomination for actor in supporting. Adding to the film's brilliance, Ron Howard, not a favorite director of mine, captures this film wonderfully whether it is the intense facial up-close shots or even the hand-held camera work during the scenes of tension. Salvatore Totino's photography and Hans Zimmer's score add depth and drama to the film. I also give congratulations to Peter Morgan for his brilliant script. I am disappointed that this had to be rated R. If they took the four f-bombs out as well as the unneeded scene of a naked guy running into the ocean, it would have had a better rating so more people can see this great film.",10,3,7,3 January 2009
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A more action-packed Holmes
","'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadow' picks up where the prequel left off; Holmes is tracking down Professor Moriarty, a man he believes is responsible for a series of bombings and mysterious deaths around world. With the help of his pal Watson (off to be married soon), and a gang of gypsies, which includes The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's Noomi Rapace, set out on a game of cat-and-mouse to find the schemes of the sinister Professor.Though there is an element of mystery in this film, it is not as in-depth as the first film. Rather the focus is on the action sequences and clever humor. This is not necessarily a bad thing though; in fact it helps move the plot along. The first film suffered because the story was slow. In this Holmes though, there is not one second that drags. The story itself is not special, but its pace is what counts. Walking out of the theater, I felt refreshed and glad that I saw this movie. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are once again a true treat to watch as Holmes and Watson. Their chemistry and interactions are perfect; it's easy to tell that both had fun with the script and with each other. Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty gives a solid performance, as a cold, manipulative, power hungry villain. Unlike Mark Strong in the first film, he is a believable antagonist. Noomi Rapace is a nice flavor as Madam Sim. The set and costume designs are exquisite, bringing to life of what Europe was like in the late 1800s. I smell Oscar for these departments. The sound and editing is crisply done, and the music is top-notchedâ€”Hans, you're truly the best. The visual effects are mostly good, but some scenes were a bit over the top and borderline ridiculous. One of many examples include a woman being thrown from a fast moving train into a river, without sustaining injury or even dying. This is impossible. Then again, it's Hollywood. The filmmakers aren't doing their job if a sense of the ridiculous is not thrown into an action flick from time to time. 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadow' delivers as a great, action-packed, and a rather humorous, popcorn loving flick. Note: the dog dies again.",9,143,246,16 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," Surprisingly pretty good...
","People told me not to see the 2003 release of 'The Hulk' and so I didn't see it. I expected the same news for this release, but I was told to see it. Having not seen the '03 version, I anticipated this would be a sequel and I wouldn't like it since I missed the first one. To my surprise though, 'The Incredible Hulk' was no sequel, rather its own take on the character Bruce Banner and the Hulk.Unlike some other superhero movies that I have seen, this had a plot that I found interesting. Rather than just being about a giant, angry green man who unleashes massive destruction, it's about the real man underneath who wants to change. Such a unique idea shows that the lead actor Edward Norton, who helped wrote the script, is more than just an ordinary thespian.Norton was a great choice for Bruce Banner/The Hulk. He's believable, engaging, and at times funny. Liv Tyler (still beautiful as ever), is another a good addition to the film as Banner's romance. Together, Norton and Tyler made the film even more intriguing. It was also nice to see Tim Roth, who later becomes the Hulk's archenemy in the movie. I've only seen him in a couple of other films, but he always played a decent villain as he does in this.Like with all other superhero movies, there's a lot of CGI. I won't say I was impressed by it like I was with 'King Kong' or even 'Transformers', since it's almost in every action flick, but the fight sequence between Hulk and Abomination at the end was quite a feast for the eyes.But there were several things that left me hanging at the end of the film. I'm not going to say what they are, but I found them rather bothersome. Then again, this leaves room for a sequel. I will say though that the last scene in the film has an appearance of Tony Stark from Iron Man. This leaves clear evidence that 'The Avengers' is underway for the big screen. 8/10",8,2,3,28 June 2008
The Monuments Men," The Monument's Men is not monumental
","'The Monument's Men' feels almost like a heist movie set during WWII. A group of 'art collectors' are recruited to steal back valuable art pieces that the Nazis have absconded from invaded countries. These individuals are called 'The Monument's Men' hence the title. A-list actors play these men: John Goodman, Matt Damon, George Clooney, Jean Dujardin, Bill Murray, Bill Balaban, and Hugh Bonneville. Based on a true story, this film seems like a fun one to watch. The trailers played it out as a comedy thriller with spurts of action. However, in watching it, the film is anything but that. Also in the director and writer's chair, Clooney takes the approach of seriousness, dates, and a timeline of facts. The focus is more on how the art pieces are found rather than the individuals who achieved these actions. In this regard, the movie wanders from one event to another, without giving the audience enough flamboyant characters. I relish that Clooney has made a WWII picture, but it is dull. I love all the actors in this film, but they don't do a thing here in entertainment. Clooney and Damon are bland. Goodman and Dujardin are incredibly limited. Murray tries to act serious, but just looks sleepy. Balaban has the only energy present as the mousy private. A misleading trailer and cast simply going through the motions kills it. In an attempt to add an emotional impact, there is a scene where a Christmas song plays at a military base where soldiers are wounded and dying. What could have been an engaging moment delivers as a failed method of moving the audience. Alexandre Desplat's score is meant to be moving but feels shallow and hokey. The rest of the movie runs into this problem. I want to take it seriously, but I can't. How the monument's men searched and found the art pieces is the only thing that keep this movie going. This was enough for me to sit through it. I really wanted to like the movie. The Monument's Men is not monumentalÂ…it is average. Nick Clooney gets a good cameo at the end by the way.",5,0,0,2 August 2014
Captain Phillips," Excellent movie-making with great performances by Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi
","Hollywood loves to sensationalize true stories as major motion pictures. They have been doing so for decades and it sells tickets. Fiction over fact is much more enjoyable and dramatic than the often hard, dull truth. That does not necessarily mean all events depicted are false. In the case of Captain Phillips, we as audience members will never know the real experiences that man went through psychologically, emotionally, and to some extent physically. All we really know is that his cargo ship was 126 miles off the Somali coastline and it was boarded by Somali pirates. He was then taken hostage in a lifeboat where he remained captive for three days before the navy and the Navy SEALS (with their clever marksmanship) were able to save him. However, filmmakers can give us an assumed 'dramatized' glimpse of the events by driving our emotions and putting us on the edge of our seats. The movie 'Captain Phillips' does this with gusto and success for two core reasons.The first is the talent. Tom Hanks, one of the best actors a director can ask for, plays the role as Captain Phillips. He depicts him as a mild-mannered, by-the-book captain who does anything and everything he can to not only survive, but help his crew make it out alive. He proves himself a very witty individual that cannot be helped admired. After all, the real Captain Phillips is a hero of sortsâ€”not the kind who wears a cape, but a real-world brave person who is vulnerable and can be hurt. Tom Hanks plays this to the tee. For the two hours and fourteen minutes, Tom masterfully displays a wide variety of emotionsâ€”defiance, fear, bravery, shock, and sorrow. For the last twenty minutes alone, Tom Hanks truly gives a performance audience members will remember. Newcomer Barkhad Abdi as the head of the pirate boarding-party turns in an equally brilliant performance. The writer was very smart in making his character not a one-dimensional villain. Instead, he is a man plagued by the ungodliness of the human conditionâ€”uncontrollable hate and violence yet full of boastful pride. The smug sneer on his face and his sarcastic, repeated phrase, 'Everything will be alright Irish' (his nickname for Phillips) adds further to his character's sardonic personality. Bill Ray's solid writing highlights the depth of these characters; nonetheless, it is still the actors who bring his words to life. The second reason for the movie's success is the technical works of the crew. Paul Greengrass is an auteur of the action/thriller genre and his visual style has been repeated over and over again in the mainstream action flicksâ€”hand-held camera, natural lighting techniques, quick cuts between action, strong emphasis on field sound, etcetera. While this style has been seemingly overdone in many movies, it works well for this film. The type of camera angles put the audience right into the scene unflinchingly. Both the fast edits and the heart-pounding music heighten the tension. I sense Oscar nominations for cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, editor Chris Rouse, and composer Henry Jackman. Even though we know what happens at the end of the movie, the people behind the camera are able to make the audience suspend their disbelief, and have them crave the suspense, thrills, and action that this ride has to offer. In a nutshell, 'Captain Phillips' is a fun, intense film that excels in entertainment and characters. 10/10",10,0,5,12 October 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas can do better than this!
","I remember seeing Star Wars at age five. I was addicted to Star Wars. I was wondering how The Phantom Menace was going to do. I thought that it was going to be a triumph like the other three, but I was proven wrong. It was an o.k. movie, but the story itself was weak. It filled some of the details, but not all. Also Lucas did a mistake in that movie. In The Empire Strikes Back, Obi-wan says to Luke, 'Go to the Degobay system. There you will find Yoda who TRAINED ME!' Master Yoda was the master of Obi-wan, not Qui-gon Jinn, but I have to admit that if it wasn't from Liam Nelson for being in this film, the film would have crumpled. The effects were phenomenal, there was more humor, and a few good action sequences. That was another problem with the film, there was only two real good action sequences, which were the podrace and the battle at the end including the duel with lightsabers, which I thought was awesome, because in the other 3 films, there wasn't much into the duels, except a flip in Episode VI by Luke Skywalker to dodge a blow taht would have cut him in two halves. Another problem was how hokey and corny the film was with some of the creatures including the flying blue thing at the shop, and Sebulba, the podracer, nemesis of Anakin. The other problem with the film was that the dark jedi, Maul was not much of a character. To me, he was an object. You could not hate him or like him, and he didn't talk except five lines, and what was with the horns on his head? He looked like the devil! However, I do love the music of the great duel at the end, which increased the suspense in your body. I give this film a 7 out of 10. Lucas could do better than this. He needs to use more interesting ideas.",5,2,4,7 March 2004
3:10 to Yuma," One great western!
","I've always enjoyed the western genre and to a disappointment Hollywood has not made any westerns for several years. With the release of this movie, I just had to see it. And I have to say, this is a darn good one.I was a bit surprised that Russell Crowe was the lead role (I never imagined him as a cowboy). But yet again, he delivers a grand performance as the captured outlaw Ben Wade. Christian Bale was another fabulous thespian in this film as the protagonist whose duty is take the outlaw (Crowe) to the 3:10 train that leads to Yuma. Bale's in another serious role like his previous ones for Batman Begins and The Prestige. But he seemed more believable and a bit more mature, particularly with having a beard and portraying a war battered character that only had one leg.The other supporting cast members were also great, including Peter Fonda, Logan Lerman, and Ben Foster, who was a real hellion. The gunfights and chases were splendidly done and very long with defiant violence and a shaky camera, which pulled me deep, into the action sequences.Despite the elongated action scenes, which indeed are long, when one goes away, the movie drags until a new one arrives. Other than that, I was satisfied with this western. It's a good shoot 'em up, bang up, with great actors, a good story, and a high body count! 9/10",9,1,3,17 September 2007
The Sound of Music," The mother of all Musicals!
","Ever since I was a kid, I saw 'The Sound of Music' and considered as the best musical and one of my favorite movies. Now as a young adult, it still remains as one of my favorites. First of all, it has Julia Andrews's best performance. I enjoyed her role as Mary Poppins, but she flourishes and illuminates the screen as Maria, the cheerful, witty, and funny want-to-be nun. She brings to life some of the most memorable songs that drown out all others such as: 'Do-Rei-Mei' and 'The Sound of Music.' Second, the magnificent score of Irwin Kostal adds to beauty of the music. It uplifts my soul to levels that hardly any other music can surpass. Third, the wonderful shots of the landscape (on location) add to the authenticity to the film's story that not even Terrence Malick could dream up. Fourth, the supporting casts (particularly the seven children) make believable performances. Even the serious Christopher Plummer shines a new light on his character as the widower Captain.Fifth, the story itself makes a great film. It's not elongated or filled with plot holes, but unique with many individual subplots at hand such as the romances between Liesl and Ralph, and later Maria and The Captain. Sixth, for a movie in the 1960s covering events in the 1930s such as: the lighting, sets, art direction, and costume designs make it all feel real.There are some people that I know says this movie is too 'sugar-coated' or even unrealistic to the time period. That's a load of manure. This is the perfect feel-good musical ever made. There's only six other musicals that I have seen that I consider grand, but this beats them all. 10/10 If you have not seen this movie, even if you don't like musicals, you're missing a whole lot!",10,2,8,19 May 2008
The Expendables 2," More destruction, more death, more laughs, more fun
","You'd think a sequel to something like 'The Expendables' would be nothing more than a repetitive rendition of the originalâ€”endless shootouts, big explosions, cool fight scenes, and wisecrack one-liners. To be honest, it is. This does not make the movie bad at all. In fact, it is an improvement from the first one, specifically with the technical aspectsâ€”the hand-held camera is removed, night scenes are kept to a minimum, the dialog is clearer, and the quick cuts of action move much more fluently. In short, Director Simon West brings us a more visually pleasing film to watch versus Stallone (sorry Rambo).The plot is simple: the expendables take on a job that results in the death of one of their own and they go on a destructive journey to seek revenge. There are some cute tie-ins of this film and its predecessor, but the story is presented as its own. A viewer can watch this without having seen the prequel. What I really enjoy about this Expendables more than the first one, is the extension of the cast. There are some new faces: Liam Hemsworth and Nan Yu are the new team members of the expendables. Both add subtle diligence to their respective roles, especially Hemsworth, who in one scene relates a story about how his last tour in Afghanistan went to hell in a handbag. For an action film, this is very poignant. Chuck Norris makes two big appearances, and they still show that he is the man to blow stuff up. Scwarzenegger and Willis's roles are vastly extended from mere cameos. It is humorous to watch as they exchange spoofs on themselves as well as unleash mass destruction in an airport while driving a very small car. Jean Claude Van Damme plays the villain, whose character is coincidentally named Villain. It is neat to see him be the bad guy for a change. His thick, dark jacket and stunning sunglasses gives him the appearance of a villain in one of his past movies, but his suave way of talking and his cold-hearted behavior says otherwise. The only downside is that he does not have enough screen time to be a truly great villainâ€”its almost as if he is intentionally kept at arms length, like Blofeld in Bond. The screenwriters at least had the courage to give him a final showdown with Stallone. The man can still jump high and make a mean kick (at least on-camera). 'The Expendables 2' is violent, intense, and moves quickly like the characters in a battle zone. There is a higher body, more explosions, more laughs, and more actors at play. In conclusion, 'The Expendables 2' is more fun.",9,4,8,22 August 2012
Skyfall," Bond continues to be the world's hero of entertainment
","James Bond has always been my favorite action hero. I have read most of the books and seen all of the movies. While the '06 release of 'Casino Royale' revived Bond and 'Quantum of Solace' proved a mediocre sequel, 'Skyfall' gives Agent 007 a new clean slate. It holds a story of its own, pays homage to other Bond flicks, and introduces characters that all of us Bond fans have come to love over the past years. Daniel Craig is back as Bond and once again, he embodies the soul of the man. He kicks ass, does the impossible, and even steals the hearts of some hot babes. Pure Bond. Judi Dench is perfect as usual as M. Ralph Fiennes, Naomi Harris, and Albert Finney give decent performances in their respective roles. Finney is particularly amusing. But in any James Bond film, the antagonist is what helps make the movie really memorable. Javier Bardem proves a true genius as 'Skyfall's' villain. He plays a good psychopath (without relying on any reference to No Country for Old Men), and adds strong levels of flamboyance, wicked humor, and even devastating emotion. It may seem a bit odd that Sam Mendes, a master of dramatic films like 'American Beauty' and 'Road to Perdition' would direct a Bond. Even so, Mendes does a stand up job of combining both character drama and stunning action sequences. In addition, his technical team helps him craft such a success. Thomas Newman delivers a lush score and Roger Deakins beautifully photographs each scene with care and precision. The only downer about this Bond is the overabundance of CGI. While some effects were photo realistic, others were blatantly awful. Agent 007 has entertained us as the world's greatest secret agent. And he has done so for 50 years. No other franchise has achieved such an accomplishment. Of 23 movies, 'Skyfall' is one of the best. Let us hope that he continues to be our hero with installments of Bond 24 and 25.",9,12,24,11 November 2012
Iron Man 3," A great start for the 2013 Blockbuster Season
","May is the starting month for summer blockbusters. 'Iron Man 3' is the first one for this season and it does not let down. Rather than being a tie in to the other 'Iron Man' films and 'The Avengers,' this Iron Man stands out completely on its own in merit. To summarize the overall plot of the new Iron Man, it is basically about the champ down on his luck who needs a comeback. Tony Stark's new nemesis is a mysterious terrorist known as the Mandarin, played in an out-of-character role by Ben Kingsley. After obliterating Stark's home and crippling his iron suits, Stark is forced on his own to survive and try to figure out a way to thwart the enemy's plans. We expect Stark to win and we know he willÂ…he's Iron Man after all. Nevertheless, we want to see how he will triumph over his foes. A frequently overused plot device, it still somehow works and makes an intriguing movie. Things are often predictable (as in most superhero flicks), but there are also some nice surprises. I thank Shane Black for his contribution as both writer and director for the movie. Jon Favreau is still in the picture as producer and Stark's trusting bodyguard Happy Hogan. Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow reprise their roles as Colonel Rhodes and Pepper Potts. Paltrow particularly breaks the norm from the typical damsel in distress and makes a stand with a fiery intensity. Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall step in as new characters, and both seem to be just having fun with their roles (perhaps too much in some scenes). The film moves at a steady pace. The action and humor is abundant. The VFX is meticulously impressive. The characters are solid. There is nothing more I can ask for in the big budget Super hero flick. 'Iron Man 3' kicks off the summer season so far with a smashing success. I hope that 'Star Trek Into Darkness' does as well later this month.",9,1,8,5 May 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Sheer Excellence!
","'E.T. The Extraterrestrial' has always been a favorite movie of mine since I saw it as a kid. There are many aspects as to I like this film, but the biggest reason is the character E.T. a diminutive, mushroom-shaped headed alien with two big eyes.To briefly put the plot of 'E.T.', it is about a boy named Elliot who finds and befriends an alien who has been left behind. The movie pulls me into it like a melodrama. Rather than focusing on dialog, since E.T. doesn't speak, his/its pair of big eyes and human-like facial expressions grasps me through the many emotions he/it expresses. When he/it does speak, it is minimal and rudimentary-almost nonverbal like a parrot and his words are from the heart. The fictional character E.T. touches and brings gladness to my heart every time I see it, and every time I think about him/it. It fills my heart with innocence, hope, and good cheer. The movie reminds of the imagination I had as a child, as well as the innocence. In addition, the film's 'feel good' attitude has outstanding visual effects, beautiful cinematography, and John Williams' ultimate score (second to 'Star Wars'). Henry Thomas's performance as the boy Elliot is among the best I've seen in a child actor. He doesn't sound rehearsed or coached like so many other child actors are; he is sheer excellence and believable as a kid who wants a friend and gets his wish. This movie also has some of Steven Spielberg's most brilliant direction, an individual who can tell a unique and great narrative, supported by awe-inspiring camera shots and angles, (particularly with the bicycle sequence). 'E.T.' is a movie that is to be seen for all ages. It will make you laugh, tense, and even cry. 10/10",10,0,1,11 October 2008
Chinatown," The film itself is a master achievement
","There are not many modern-day movies I have seen that totally blow me off my feet. I've heard much high-praise from Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown'. When I finally got a hold of the movie through my library, I sat down and was totally captivated for all of the two hours and ten minutes of the film.Jack Nicholson was always one of my favorite actor's because of his sense of humor, cynicism and charm. He was himself in Chinatown, but he wasn't the typical Jack like in 'As Good As it Gets' or 'The Bucket List.' He made a more serious and grim character that I found amazing.I've never seen Faye Dunaway in many movies, but this is the best one I have seen her in. Her character is seductive, gorgeous, and mysterious. Her and Jack really spun the movie as one of the best mysteries I have seen. The Oscar-winning script by Robert Towne is witty and classic; when I think I've figured the story out, I am wrong. However, it' real brilliance was made by Nicholson and Dunaway.This is the only film I have seen by Roman Polanski. Despite the allegations and hell of a life he's lived, he's one fine director. He added to the mystery of the film by his unusual and sometimes suspenseful camera angles that are in the league of a Hitchcock film. 10/10",10,1,2,28 June 2008
Gravity," Alfonso Cuaron's eye of terror in space
","Space. The place where there is no sound. No life. Nothing. Alfonso Cuaron's new hit film is set against this backdrop. Simply calling 'Gravity' a big-budget a space film does not serve it justice. The focus is on two astronauts, Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) who are on a mission to repair an old satellite. With a ten-minute single shot introduction, Cuaron introduces us to these individuals, revealing their personalities via comical banter and progressive dialog. Stone is on her first assignment, a little jittery while Kowalski is a veteran and an easygoing kind of guy. This scene would be boring for any other movie besides this one. The visuals and fluid camera movements from one character another is so mind-boggling that you find yourself feeling like your floating in space with them. Seeing this in 3D really helps this perspective. Characters and items drift right into you! This more than extraordinary intro is interrupted with a violent flow of debris from a destroyed Russian satellite forcing the characters into a game of gliding survival. Anything can happen to these individuals and one bad thing after another follows. Will the characters die? Or will they make it back to earth in one piece? That is the fun for us with the remaining 80 minutes. Many fellow critics have more or less criticized this film for its constant defiance of physics. Yes, Cuaron pushes the boundaries of what would really happen in space. There are times where the audience, along with myself chuckle at the limitation that push the suspension of disbelief. Even some clichÃ© plot devices of the film survival genre are utilized. Putting all that aside, 'Gravity' excels on so many other levels. The most prominent is the visuals. It is more than a guarantee that this movie is going to win for Visual Effects category. They have depth and are photo-realistic. You really feel like that you witnessing space and earth from a distance. The cinematography, both CG and real-life is beyond words. The movements and lighting techniques evoke the darkness and sudden bright light of the stars and sun. Another gold statue. It would be a crime if it did not win.The second aspect that makes 'Gravity' spectacular is the usage, or rather no use of sound. After all, there is no sound waves to travel or reflect off of in space. Many scenes only record the voices and grunts of the actors when things are growing perilous. The sound effects that are manufactured for the film are cool when used. They add that deep space, sounding element (if there is such a way to put it). A neat method used to emphasize the magnitude of the situation is Steven Price's score. His music, flawlessly mixed with synth and orchestra, captures the direness and intensity of the movie. It grows loud, often overtaking some moments to the point of bombastic levels. The ending piece adds a new element of uplifting hope. Another gold statue. The third thing that works for this film is the story. I do not praise the creativity of it. There really is not too much to offer in this regard. However, the spin that Cuaron takes with this movie is unique. He makes a simple idea of survival and broadens it into a terrifying and unimaginable scenario. Many sci-fi films often are about survival, ex: Alien, Prometheus, and The Thing. But no other feature has done so purely in characters gliding in space. He does so without making it dull (which is a big trap with this kind of film) or pretentious. No real story is ever original. Just ask James Cameron with 'Avatar.' However, like Jim, Cuaron made a fun alternative with it. The fourth factor is the acting. Sandra Bullock as Stone is pretty much in every minute of the film. She has unfortunately gotten sort of a bad rap from the kind of movies she has made. Nevertheless, I always considered her a fine actress. Here, she gives perhaps her most humane character ever. She is forced into perhaps the most terrifying situation imaginable and reacts with all the ingredients of any sane person: fear, anxiety, agitation, depression, submissiveness, and ultimately defiance. She does so with believability, with and without the astronaut helmet. One scene in particular, she evokes complete, empathic helplessness. The audience's reaction? Silence. Her accolade nominations are more than understandable and deserving. George Clooney does not reach the same level. Rather, he takes the back seat on this one, acting more like his charming, funny self than anything.The final thing that makes 'Gravity' a great film is Cuaron's direction. This is not only seen in the visuals and the acting, but in its delivery. Every shot captured in this film is done so with perfection. His eye of terror in space has set a new standard in science-fiction that has not been seen in about 20 years. He gives us a vision that is something to see, hear, feel, remember, and above all experience. I find it almost an injustice that this movie will be converted to online viewing and Blu-Ray. This movie is meant for the big screen and in 3D. I really hope that this majestic edge will not be lost because of the small screen compression.Mr rating: 10/10",9,1,3,20 January 2014
Lone Survivor," A powerful film that demands our attention to its characters, story, and above all its dignity towards our brave US servicemen
","'Lone Survivor' has the makings of any great war picture. A likable band of brothers fighting against impossible odds. Bloody gun battle sequences. And even some hidden messages. What makes this film more unique than most others is the fact that it is based on a true story. Set in 2005, the movie follows SEAL Team 10, whom are sent into the perilous grounds of Afghanistan to take out an important Taliban leader. When their mission becomes compromised, they are forced to abort with an entire army hot on their trails. There were four members of SEAL 10. Only one lived to tell his story, hence the movie's title.There are three things in this feature that have left me in deep thought and personal reflection. The first is the reasoning behind the mission's failure. A small group of Afghan shepherds stumble upon SEAL Team 10. They are detained and the SEALs decide what to with their prisoners. Rather than simply killing the sheep herders, which is against the rules of engagement to kill unarmed prisoners or unarmed combatants, they release them. In turn, the herders flock to the Taliban, giving the SEALs whereabouts to them. Incidentally, this leads to most of SEAL 10s deaths. Morally, releasing the prisoners may have been the right. Logically, this was definitely not the situation. I really should not judge out of respect for the fallen, but this decision sheds the all too familiar light that the US enemies share no compassion and give no quarter--which goes against the American ideology. This action of SEAL Team 10 makes me think upon myself on what I would do in such an ethical conundrum. Deep down, like many, I would not have been so pleasant. The second factor is that this movie ruptures the stereotype that all Afghans are wicked, barbaric, American haters. Without giving too much more away, the film shows that there are some good-hearted and brave individuals that live in Afghanistan. See, people will walk into the theater, anticipating another shoot 'em up, bang 'em up war flick. 'Lone Survivor' has its sustained moments of violence, but its roots are in the goodness of humanity. The final thing that works uniquely for this film is the characterization of the members of SEAL Team 10. All the actors wrap themselves into their characters, making them good, heroic men to admire. We smile at their daily banters and grow depressed as many of them are brutally killed. Wahlberg as Marcus Luttrell delivers one of his best works in years. He displays so many emotions with perfection. Ben Foster turns in equal brilliance and stark ferocity. This man needs some more great dramatic work on his resume.All these aside, people will probably remember this feature most for its visual pleasures. A little bit of the Jerry Bruckheimer effect is at work--slow-motion shots for dramatic emphasis, hand-held camera in the heat of the action, and music on a gallantry scale. Yet, it feels more like a documentary. The opening credit sequence is archive footage of SEALS in training, and the ending is a montage of pictures and videos of the men who had fought and died on this mission. In addition, voice-over narration is utilized and base names and locations appear to fill in the geographical gaps. I give kudos to the sound effects editor and mixers for their Oscar nominated work. They truly make the audience feel like they are in the middle of a war zone. Peter Gabriel's song 'Heroes' presents as one of the most uplifting songs in film that I haven't heard in years.The final thing I will mention before I conclude is the audience's reaction to at my viewing. Once the feature had drawn to a close, it was silent. Actually, through the entire film, the crowd was quiet. A pen could be dropped and heard. No applause. No sniffling of tears. Nothing. The only other film I had this experience at was 'The Passion of the Christ.' I can only surmise that everyone was stunned and engulfed by the film's powerful impact. It was a privilege to see this feature on the big screen.",8,2,10,17 January 2014
Star Trek," A feast for the eyes in almost every way...
","My knowledge of Stark Trek goes as far back as the 1980 film release 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture'. So, having not seen the original television series in the 60s, I did not know what J.J. Abrams was going to pull off. So far, from the work he has done, I've been impressed. With an open-mind, I went to see the film.For starters, I will call it a feast for the eyes. The CGI is outstanding, and the photography plasters the scenes throughout the film beautifully. The works of the production, set, costume, and make-up design are exquisite. I evenly thoroughly enjoyed Michael Giacchino's epic score. In addition, J.J. Abram's use of hand-held camera and unique camera angles add to creativity of the film. The cast, to a huge surprise, meshed into their roles perfectly. I'll be honest, I've never heard of most of the actors in the film before, but each of them is close to flawless. I will mention though that Zoe Saldana as Uharu was a disappointment. She has a great figure, but her acting is paper thin and rather annoying. Not giving too much of the plot away, it was a bigger let down that Kirk does not get the girl.This maybe considered a good twist since it is typical in most modern-day films that the good guy gets the girl and rides off in the sunset with her, but I think the scriptwriters' choice of romance in the film was a mistake. There are other things in the film that I found rather jarring, such as some of the character traits introduced in both Kirk and Spock. In the 1980s films, William Shatner stood as a guy who always won a fought, well, in this Star Trek, Kirk may throw the first punch in a brawl, but he then gets close to being dead many, many times in which some external force ends up saving him. As with Spock, well, I'll just say that I never imagined him as being such a jerk, but then again, the scriptwriters eventually make the two characters develop a respect for one another. The remainder of the story was fine for such a big sci-fi epic. It's nothing Oscar worthy, but it stands as being creative, holding my interest from start to finish. Overall, Star Trek is a wonderful film that has brought back hope into the Star Trek franchise. If they make a second one, which I think the filmmakers will, I'll definitely be attending at a theater nearby. My rating: ***1/2 out of **** Don't wait for DVD, see it on the big screen!",9,1,8,10 June 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Violent as hell...but I think Quentin Tarantino has made himself another good one
","I wouldn't call myself a die-hard Quentin Tarantino fan, but I appreciate his work and the stories he tells in his movies. 'Inglourious Basterds' is a true Quentin Tarantino film. It is another great film of his, but it is not his best.When I say 'Inglourious Basterds' is a true Tarantino film, it is a story made up of a bunch of other stories that are related and tied together for one big finale. This maybe considered a boring approach to a film, and yes, the movie does drag quite a bit, but it's still interesting.Also, like in his other films, the characters conversations are made up of small talk and BS. In fact, there's scene halfway into the movie where several Americans are undercover, secretly discussing their plans while surrounded in a basement full of drunken Nazis. What seems to be a boring scene is intense, because you don't know if one of them might say or do something that might start the next 'OK Coral Shootout'. Adding more authenticity, the characters that are German speak German. Those who are French, speak French. It gets somewhat tiresome in keeping up with the subtitles, but I personally like that Tarantino did this in his film. It makes the movie feel more realistic, while other Hollywood directors take the shortcut in having everyone speaking English. In addition, the characters rarely tell the plot; rather it develops through the characters actions and their solitary schemes. This really helps humanize all the characters, most of which are quite despicable but you still love them and it hurts to watch many of them die horrible deaths. The Nazis are depicted as the 'bad guys', but somehow Tarantino magically makes them people you can both pity and even respect.The best performance in the whole movie, in my opinion, belongs to Christoph Waltz, who plays Colonel Hans Landa aka 'The Jew Hunter'. He doesn't just deliver his lines, he makes them flow in such a way that it complements his character. He's a guy to hate, but also one to respect. He's not a bumbling idiot, a stereotypical Nazi like in The Indiana Jones films, but a cruel, charming, and intelligent German soldier. I've never heard of Christoph Waltz before, but I hope at the very least he gets an Oscar nomination. All the other actors are superb because they become their characters. The other two noteworthy performances belong to Melanie Laurent as Shoshanna and Brad Pitt as Aldo Raines. I've never heard of Melanie Laurent, but to me, her character, Shoshanna is the one I like the most. I consider her the 'femme fatal'. She's stunning gorgeous, but because of what the Nazis had done to her, she becomes a schemer who plots to kill Nazis but is marked by a complete, unanticipated downfall by her hatred. I hope she gets an Oscar nom in the supporting category too. As with Brad Pitt, I consider his role as Lt. Aldo Raines as one of his best. He maintains a good 'hick' accent, and he delivers some of the funniest lines ever while keep a straight face. It's easy to say he had a blast making this film. He probably won't receive a nom, but I'd keep my fingers crossed. Overall, script, performances, direction, editing, and cinematography all excellent. I even enjoyed the music that Quentin Tarantino uses from the old 'Spaghetti Westerns'. It is somewhat ridiculous, but it actually blends into the film nicely. But there are two things that prevent this film from getting a perfect score. One is the pass. There is some action in it, but most of it comes at the very end of the film for the big bloodbath. Some of the dialog was too drawn out and unnecessarily long. When a movie is over two hours, my butt starts itching in the theater seat. And the other thing is the violence.I know that when I walked into the theater, I was in for a violent movie. In his past films, Tarantino over-exaggerates his violence, almost to the point that it is comical, like in the 'Kill Bills'. Some of the violence in 'Inglourious Basterds' is rather comical, but most of it comes to the point that it is unbearable and sadistic. Tarantino has no limits in what he shows in his films, but I do. Some people can handle it, many others can't. It became too much for me. In fact, I found it distracting from the story. I get the idea that Nazis are getting mowed down with machine gun fire, but it doesn't need to go on and on and on. I like this movie, but it becomes too much towards the end.",10,4,12,29 August 2009
Iron Man 2," A more character driven Iron Man
","I enjoyed the first 'Iron Man' because it was just a great action flick with interesting plot and characters. This 'Iron Man' is very much like 'Spiderman 2' (though better) in that the film focuses on the main character and his problems, as well as his flaws. Tony Stark is still egotistical, selfish, and loves hitting the booze, but he faces worse challenges than before. Though unofficially bringing world peace, power hungry senators and his competitor, a weapons man whose way over his head wants Stark's technology. A crazed Russian wants to kill Stark for he claims that his family was responsible for ruining his. On top of that, the power circuit, or whatever you call it, he uses to keep himself alive is intoxicating his blood, killing him. Needless to say, Stark is under a lot of pressure and is in a midlife crisis. Rather a near death crisis. This film shows us a darker and weaker side to the main character, which humanizes him from the invulnerable, stereotypical super hero. In addition, more of Stark's past as well his father's past is revealed in this film, which opens some skeletons in the closet, as well as making the film all the more interesting. The movie also contains some thoroughly decent roles from all the actors. Robert Downey Jr. once again illuminates as Tony Stark. Gwyneth Paltrow brings some comic relief to the table as Pepper Potts. Scarlett Johansen shines with beauty and fierceness as the Black Widow. Sam Rockwell makes up as the annoying, whiny little pipsqueak Justin Hammer, in which we all love to shut up. Mickey Rourke is perfect as Ivan Vanko, with his tattoos and wicked grin. Even Don Cheadle as Terrence Howard's replacement of Colonel Rhodes wasn't a bad pick (though I do prefer Howard in the role).As I mentioned earlier, there's a unique story and secrets are revealed about Tony Stark. There isn't as much as action as there was in the first film, but that isn't a negative. I will add that the effects have seemed to improve from the previous film. How so? I don't know. I thought the first one was impeccable in that department, but this almost makes it seamless, blending into the film perfectly. It's almost hard to know what's CGI and what isn't. Though I enjoy this film, it's not the greatest thing I have seen. Unfortunately the movie drags, particularly in the middle section of the film. A couple of times I had to look at my watch, wondering when the film was going to wrap up. Overall though, it's something you viewers who love superhero films shouldn't miss.*** out of ****",7,4,10,26 May 2010
Mississippi Burning," Hackman makes the film!
","I saw this movie several years ago, and it is a good film. It is about the powers of racism and prejudice in the south during the 1960s. It sounds like another film about civil rights that most would say o.k., but Hackman brightens it and makes something worthwhile; he's performance is outstanding and believable, as well as the other tidbits! It has been tragically overlooked (Rain Man won everything), which makes me sad.So, the story is about three African-Americans who go missing, presumably dead. Agents are called in to investigate a possible clan that gathers in this town, which murders African-Americans for fun. Agent Anderson (Hackman) and Agent Ward (Dafoe) are the lead investigators. Their suspicions grow around the deputy (Dourif). His wife (McDormand) hides secrets that must be told which leads to a dangerous but vital path for everyone! Everything is good: the script, the music, the cinematography, the set-decoration, the view of an unforgotten south and the acting, especially by Gene Hackman. Due to its long length, I give it a ****1/2 out of ***** See it, it is an important film that teaches us all that we are all indeed human!",9,3,4,24 April 2006
The 13th Warrior," A great Vikings film
","As a John McTiernan fan of his previous films such as Die Hard and Predator, and a studier of Norse mythology, I decided to see this film. I may have come late, but I have to say that once again Mr. McTiernan has delivered another great film of bloody and gritty action, and some surprisingly well incorporated Norse mythology.The Thirteenth Warrior is based off of Michael Crichton's novel 'Eaters of the Dead' and the true story of Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad (try to sat that three times really fast). The story explores an 'ancient evil' that is not named, known as the Wendol (pronounced with a v) that are cannibals whom are described as having 'teeth like a lion, figure of a man, and a head like a bear with claws' that slaughter anyone who comes across their path.Ibn (as I call him), an Arabic ambassador, is chosen as the thirteenth warrior to accompany a band of a dozen twelve brave vikings. They are sent to the north to assist the ravaged villages and defeat the Wendol.This is a great film that explores both action and heavy Norse mythology (as stated in the first paragraph). It may sound comical that Antonio Banderas plays an Arab, but he gives a very descent performance as a man of politics who transform into an unexpected hero. Vladimir Kulich also gave a very strong performance as the head of the twelve vikings, Buliwyf. The rest of the cast was simply good as well, giving off both humor and testosterone. The camera work was both thrilling and dangerous, which reminded me very much of the intense camera angles in Predator.The scenery and cinematography is superbly crafted, the heart racing score of Jerry Goldsmith (may he rest in peace) was both haunting and moving. the battle sequences were smaller, (no where in the league of Lord of the Rings) but they were exciting and intense with plenty of bloodshed. And I also have to mention that the make up job was very well done from the wigs to the scars that the warriors gained and held throughout the film.However, the first half hour of the film was somewhat hard to follow, due to the fact that the dialog was in different languages and hard to follow while other cast members such as a surprise appearance of Omar Sharif, was trying to interrupt the happenings to Banderas' character, as well as to the audience. The film I might add was a bit too short, and over way to quickly, making it more of an action flick rather than an epic like Braveheart or Gladiator, and a few intermediate stories were not solved fully.other than those flaws, i was deeply satisfied. 4/5",8,1,1,7 February 2007
The Impossible," It demands our surrender to its bold-stroking energy, its characters, its film-making, and above all its tear-jerking take of survival, humanity, and hope.
","'The Impossible' is one of those movies that will move you to tears. Not necessarily just from sadness, but for hope and humanity. Based upon a true story during the horrific disaster in Thailand eight years ago, this movie follows the journey of a family that is torn apart and forced to both survive and look for one another in the face of impossible odds. Naomi Watts plays the mother, Ewan McGregor the father, and their sons are played by Tom Holland (Lucas), Samuel Joslin (Thomas), and Oakie Pendergast (Simon). Juan Antonio Bayona crafts this film intelligently and with confidence. For the first ten minutes, he creates an earthly paradise for this familyâ€”a nice hotel room with a view of the beach, a flying lantern contest at night, and a swell swimming pool to attend. Then, the wind starts to blow violently and the ground shakes. Thunderous sounds of water, people's heads turnÂ…a tidal wave crashes through the hotel, tossing debris and people around like toysâ€”ultimately separating this family. The next hour of the film centers on the mother and her eldest son Lucas as they try to survive through the elevated water and disaster. Fortune eventually seeks them at a hospital. The second half of the film focuses on the father's perspective as he tries to find and unite the rest of his family. The conclusion is predictable, yet the performances and the filmmaking quality not only puts us on the edge of our seats, but also draws us into the emotions and traumas of these characters. The actual disaster sequence is short, but told only from the character's viewpoint. There is no wide shot like in 'Hereafter' where the film shows a flood washing away buildings and people alike. This does not mean that there aren't any visual effects. There are used sparingly and are very impressiveâ€”like 'Titanic,' it is frightening to watch as water overwhelms the characters in a scene. No movie could ever fully capture what really happened, this movie certainly peers into the gates of this hell and devastation. The sound effect designers do a phenomenal job of emphasizing the terror of the tsunami as well as the more subtle scenes. I can close my eyes and picture exactly what is happening on the screen. What really succeeds in this movie is the cast. Each actor makes the character their own and they display a versatility range of emotions. Many people, especially fellow Hollywood actors have praised Naomi Watts' performance as Oscar-worthy. She is a true genius. When it comes to expressing pain look no further than her role in '21 Grams.' Here, she combines both agony and hope into a solid mixture. One scene that particularly comes to mind is when her character is alone with her son Lucas. He goes on, ranting the rest of their family is dead. The look on her face in this moment is beyond words to describe. While Watts is worthy of a gold statue, Ewan McGregor gives an equally compelling performance. Unlike Watts, his character drove me to tears, especially when he makes a phone call to his folks at home. Tom Holland stands out the most. He starts as a typical preteen adolescent, but grows larger-than-life as he overcomes perilous obstacles and helps bring other people together. Some accolades for his performance would be amicably. Sam Joslin and Oakie Pendergast are adorable as the younger kids and they do a great job.After seeing this movie, it is safe to say that this is one of 2012's best movies. It demands our surrender to its bold-stroking energy, its characters, its film-making, and above all its tear- jerking take of survival, humanity, and hope.",10,3,6,6 January 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," More 'in-depth' with the story, but lacked the 'pirates' feeling
","The first Pirates of the Carribbean was excellent. it had everything a swashbuckling film needed. i was looking for the same thing, if not better than the previous film. it was not what i expected (excellent). At my first screening it made no sense, but the second time around is always the better round. So, the story goes that Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) owes a debt to the cursed Davy Jones, and thus becomes a marked man. he and his band of sailors must find a way out of the debt before he is eternally damned along with Jones' crew. meanwhile, Will (orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (keira Knightley) are on their way to be married, but are cut short when both of them are arrested for releasing Sparrow. In order to be free of charge, Will must obtain Jack's compass for a weasel named Lord Beckett for an unknown reason.Yet again, Will and Elizabeth are sent on another misadventure with Jack. it sounds great. The story is much more in-depth, and answers a lot of questions from the first film, but it also left some questions that needed to be answered, unanswered. However, there is rather a difference with the film, due to how the story is chopped up, for the film drifts from one scene to another without clear explanations (I had to pay close attention even more so intently for the second round of seeing it). Another difference in the film from the previous one was, was that it very dark. The first film had its sugar-coating humor that made it a popcorn-lovong film, but the 'sugarcoating' humor was absent in this film. it maybe a PG-13, but some images (I'm not a squeamish person) made me cringe a bit. The film had humor in it, but i have to say, it still lacked it. The film lost the whole 'pirates' feeling of humor that was what made the previous one fly. But, Johnny Depp still holds his charm (even though it wasn't enough), to hold things in order, as well as some other punchlines here and there. I also have to admit that the film was rather slow, and dragged. But on more positive notes, the action sequences were amazing with eye popping visual effects that conquers over its prequel. And it was also nice to see some old faces from the prequel that were needed to keep the characters likable. there are new villains, and they were simply great. Bill Nighy played an excellent role as Davy Jones, and I look forward to seeing him in the next film. there was also some twists here and there too.it was good, but not grand as the first. it is worth seeing, but not for the youngsters (there are some frightful images in it). it was good entertainment but it's not a great film like the first one. 4/5",7,1,3,8 July 2006
Argo," A bit of history that most of us don't know about makes a great feat of movie-making
","In 1979, the Iranian people overthrew their government and stormed the U.S. embassy, taking hostages. For 444 days, these people were held in captivity. During this time, the news headlines filled our TV sets with on-location coverage as well as speculations on how this terrifying event could resolve itself. As our eyes were drawn to the fate of these 52 men and women, 6 Americans had managed to escape from the embassy and found shelter in the Canadian Ambassador's house. It was only a matter of time in which they could be caught, killed, or even remotely rescued.Ben Affleck's new film focuses on both the persons and the covert operation that the CIA undertook to rescue these 6 people. Affleck plays Tony Mendez, a CIA 'extractor,' who concocts the plan to pose as a Hollywood producer of a science-fiction film called 'Argo.' The idea is to land in Terhan and then convince the 6 Americans to assume the identities of a Canadian film crew for the movie, and thus fly out of the country. He is assisted by his CIA boss (Bryan Cranston), and relies on award-winning make up designer John Chambers (John Goodman), and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin) to green light both the script and the publicity of the filmâ€”as a means to make it credible.In part what makes 'Argo' a great film is its nostalgic feeling of the 1970s, such as the clothing, the glasses, the vehicles, and even the graininess in the film. The inter-cuts of real footage and photographs of the 1979 Iranian rebellion is a real bonus in selling the story's authenticity. 'Argo' also does well in regards to holding the audience's attention. The story is well thought out and there is room for humor, drama, and suspense. While I found myself laughing a lot of the film, I was also put on the edge of my seat in the last 30 minutes. The use of hand-held cinematography and crisp editing adds to the intensity of the film. But what really makes 'Argo' a great film is the cast. Each actor adds diligence and personality to their characters. This is particularly noteworthy with Alan Arkin and John Goodmanâ€”both practically steal the show with their clever delivery of lines and levels of sentimentality towards their shared goal of saving the 6 Americans. Affleck seems a little indifferent in his performance, but as seen in the movie, that is part of the character he plays.As shown with 'Gone Baby Gone' and 'The Town,' Ben Affleck knows how to direct good movies that engage us with good characters and story. 'Argo' is another film to add to this list. In this year's coming Oscars, I hope 'Argo' gets nominated for Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Editing, and supporting actor for both Goodman and Arkin.",10,1,5,14 October 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Johnny Depp turned an OK film into a masterpiece swasbuckler!
","Johnny Depp brought the film ALIVE!!! I thought this film was a typical advenure shooting banging up, cutting up swas buckler. Ifn't wasn't for Johnny Depp, this film would not have done half as good. He should have won the best Actor award for this film, but had to lose to Sean Penn, because it was a Clint Eastwood film, and it was a drama. This film would fit well for all ages both kids and parents. However, the skeleton pirates look freaky like the dead in The Lord of the Rings Part III. This film should have also won best Make-up art for Johnny Depp. The only problem with this film was some corny bits, and some parts that should have been added. This film was an out of an ordinary swas buckler than Treasure Island or any other film. The action sequences were descent, the humor was non-stoppable from Johnny Depp, Orlando bloom was the real good guy hero, Geoffrey Rush was he hateful, and slow thinking villain, and the girl was a real hotty and cuty! this film is an honesty triumph over The Lord of the Rings Part III! It is ranked among the top five best movies of the year!",10,1,3,17 April 2004
Star Trek Into Darkness," You can't go wrong in seeing 'Star Trek Into Darkness.'
","J.J. Abrams's first Star Trek picture managed to take the familiar characters that die hard fans have relished for decades and bring them back to life with greatness, as well as present a new twist in the Star Trek universe. With 'Star Trek Into Darkness,' can Abrams and his team of writers make a sequel that is as good, perhaps even better than its predecessor? The answer is yes. This success is not necessarily just from the reappearance of all the characters from the previous film. Nor is it even from the photo-realistic visual effects and action sequences. Rather, it is revealed from its clever story and one of the best Star Trek villains ever brought back to the big screen...Kahn. The film picks up a year after the events from the prequel. Kirk has botched a mission and is demoted from his position as captain. When a series of events follow suit, including mass destruction and a death of a close friend, Kirk is put back in the captain's chair and sent on a mission to capture Kahn, the man responsible. But like with all J.J. Abram films and TV shows, there is more to it than you would ever anticipate. What is so good about this Stark Trek, is that it is quite unpredictable. Characters die sudden and unexpectedly. The story makes twist and turns, elements that are enough to put me on the edge of my seat at times. There is never a dull moment in this film. What is also so good is the amount of references tied in from other Stark Trek films. Not trying to give much away, but there is a scene re-adapted more or less from 'Wrath of Kahn.' It is a beautiful and poignant scene that many past Star Trek fans will find amusing and touching. English actor Benedict Cumberbatch takes the mantle as Kahn. For those of you who remember Ricardo Montalban in Wrath of Kahn, an old man with bad make up and a fake chest and biceps, well, Kahn is not like this anymore. His intelligence and strength are strong enough to make him more than a formidable enemy for Kirk and the Starship Enterprise's crew. His performance, loaded with blank facial expressions and lifeless eyes almost remind me of a young Anthony Hopkins playing Hannibal Lector. It would be interesting to see the two play a game of chess.J.J. Abrams has out done himself again with his new installment of his Star Trek series. It is blockbuster success in terms of fun, entertainment, action, humor, story, and above all a great villain. You can't go wrong in seeing 'Star Trek Into Darkness.'",10,14,26,9 June 2013
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Magnificentin its making and storyline, but disappointing in its acting by the kids
","For five years, since I've read this book, I've been waiting to see this film. Finally, after five eager years, it has arrived with an almost smashing success.The story is unforgettable and childlike; the plot is simple, four kids are sent away to an old man's mansion, and shortly after arriving there, they find a wardrobe, and when they step into it, they enter a fantasy world called Narnia, filled with awesome locations and talking creatures, both the good and the bad. The story goes on about a wicked Witch who turns everything into winter and ice has ruled the world for the last hundred years. But hope arrives with Aslan, a giant and computerized, but fabulous looking, giant lion, with the aid of the talented and tame voice of Liam Neeson. Together, they must defeat the witch, before the world is destoryed by evil.So, almost everything was great in this film, from the stunning visuals that are in a comparison of King Kong and Star Wars, the uplifting score from Harry Gregson-Willams (Kingdom of Heaven), the settings, costumes, make-up, and storyline. But the acting from the four kids almsot made me laugh.Why? First of all, the girl who played Lucy reminded me of an annoying little sister that had the look of Chucky. Then, the teenage girl who played Susan, was dry, boring, and an overall pain throughout the film, and the kid who played Peter, was just as equally as dry as Susan. However, the kid who played Edmund was great, and seemed not rehearsed like the others (if they were). The actress who played Witch was probably the best cast member, because she was so evil, that she is good comparison to a female and fair version of Darth Vader. And ironically, her servant was an evil Humpa Lumpa with a beard.My bottom line is that the good guys were grand, and the villains were very evil and wicked. I honestly have to say that this film should not have been PG, instead, it should have been a PG-13, due to its scary images. Anyway, it's hard to do good battle sequences with a PG rating, not that I mean the film should've been violent like Alexander or Gladiator, but needed, in my opinion to at least have some intensity like The Lord of the Rings films in terms of violence, to have more feling, and making them more intense and realistic.I enjoyed this film, that's the truth. About buying it? I probably won't because it's not an everyday movie, except for children. So, my rating is a ****1/2 out of ***** Parents, if you wnat your kids to see it, watch the film first, for some material is a bit disturbing for young kids.",8,0,0,29 December 2005
Public Enemies," One of Mann's and this year's best!
","Praying that Mann wouldn't mess up like he did with the film 'Miami Vice' I went to see his 'Public Enemies' today. As soon as the movie started with the opening prison breakout my attention was held from start to finish. It felt nice to see Michael Mann at his brilliant best again. I will admit that 'Heat' will always be his landmark crime saga, but 'Public Enemies' is an excellent follow-up. Like all of his movies, Mann jumps right into action without any dull monologue, or having a character explain the story as it goes along. It is clear enough to know what's going on and who's who. The 1930s crime spree is not my specialty in history, but I checked up on some of the characters that are portrayed in the film and many of the accuracies are right on, particularly with John Dillinger. Adding to the film's trueness to its time period is some wonderful costumes and set designs as well as music that fit not only with the era, but also to the story. When there's an emotional peak, it hits it, when there's suspense it picks up on that too, without getting bombastic. But the one thing I had difficulty with this film is the sound. Probably for the first half hour of the film, the dialog is very low, its volume focused on the sound effects and gunshots. Michael Mann is known for this, particularly in the big gun battle in 'Heat' but it stands out very noticeably, and is very disappointing. Another thing is the hand-held camera. I have no problem with hand-held, but at some scenes it seems out of place. There are also no huge lighting techniques that are used in this movie like in 'Road to Perdition' or 'Changeling.' Instead, it seems the cinematographer chose a wider aperture, or opening to let more light in. People on the IMDb board have complained about this, but I personally like it. I think one of the most well done scenes with this technique is a gun battle that takes place at night. You can see what's going on, but at the same time it is hard, like it would be at night. The only source of light used is from artificial sources that take place on the screen. Performances wise, they were great all around, though I wouldn't consider any Oscar-worthy. Depp, as always, gets into character and becomes John Dilinger. He's easily a guy the audience can sympathize with, but this doesn't necessarily mean all the bad guys are depicted as heroes. Some of them are pretty bad ass while others can be likable. This is the same way with cops. Several I absolutely despise while others I respect. Bale is one that is not necessarily the one to sympathize with, but is a guy that can be deeply respected as a hardboiled crime fighter.Marion Cotillard, who I now appreciate for her mesmerizing work in 'La Vein Rose' is gorgeous, and pulls off an okay accent. Personally though, her voice seemed a little out of place for her character, but nevertheless, she's great. In fact, there's an intense scene, in which I won't spoil, that delivers very powerfully. I doubt she won't get a nomination (that'll probably come around for her upcoming film 'Nine'). Overall, 'Public Enemies' is a great film. It's not the best I've seen, but one of Mann's best and this year's best. Overall rating: **** out of ****I will point out that there is hardly any swearing which is nice, but it is very, very violent.",9,4,8,3 July 2009
Elizabeth," One of 1998's best Pictures
","After seeing how bad 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' was, I did not bother to see this movie. However, my cousin saw it and told me it was pretty good. Now that I have seen 'Elizabeth: The Virgin Queen' twice, I thoroughly enjoyed it.I was never much of a Cate Blanchett fan, in fact I find her to be very overrated, but her performance in this is absolutely mesmerizing. Throughout the film, she has four men in her life. Her lover (Fiennes). Her defender (Rush). Her adviser (Eccleston). And her guardian (Attenborough).Each plays their part well and ultimately changes her character from start to finish as a naive, innocent princess to a ruthless and determined leader. She not only has the appearance of Queen Elizabeth, but also delivers her lines with emotion and intelligence, gradually showing these changes. How she did not get the Oscar for this is beyond my understanding. Then again, she was an unknown in 1998 versus Paltrow (who won that year). Nevertheless, I will always remember this movie as her best work.The accomplishments of the costume designs make up, and art direction doesn't just make the time period of the 1500s look realistic, but it also adds to the creativity of the film as well as an unforgettable time in Europe. I also enjoyed Remi Adefarasin's sweeping cinematography and David Hirschfelder's haunting yet beautiful score.Shekhar Kapur's direction is breathtaking. One of the most amazing scenes in the film is in the beginning where three so-called 'heretics' are burned. Rather than focusing it blatantly on the victims or on the shocked crowd, it shows the whole scene through an aerial view with slow 360 degree twirls. It may sound like it would make you dizzy but the camera is steady and captures the whole thing marvelously.The only thing I have against this movie is that some of the plots and conspiracies get confusing and hard to follow. Some of the character motives I felt were not broadened enough nor had enough time to be built up. Other than that, I really liked this prequel. 9/10I'm disappointed that this only got on Oscar in 1998, since this is one of two movies that were nominated for Picture I liked that year.",9,1,2,19 July 2008
Spider-Man 2," I waited patiently with restraint, and what do I get? ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!
","This movie is so slow moving. I have never seen a movie so slow. I can't believe this movie is on the top 250. That's ridiculous. This movie is o.k., but several things are against. Immediately, the length is against it. Another thing, the villain, he is so not evil! i honestly liked him, not hating him. I think he could have done more efort like Willem Dafoe did in the prequel. i also hated the darkness of spider-man, his friends against him, losing jobs, having his lover engaged, and his aunt in money crisis. What sucks the most is is that he is unmasked. The effects were great, a 10/10 for those, the action sequences were excellent, and the ridiculous humor was laughable. the cinematography bothered me of being so dark. As i said, the hero should be positive, not negative. Also, the additional was bad, and the dramaitc motion images of him changing his life. Otherwise, an o.k. film. The prequel was much better.

127 Hours," It's hard to do a great film about one man's survival
","The story of Aron Ralston is as incredible as is foolish. Aron is a lover of canyon climbing and the outdoors. Back in 2003, on one of his trips to the Utah canyons, he got stuck when a boulder fell on his arm. He was immobile for 127 hours until he made a bold decision of cutting off his arm. He never informed anyone where he was going much less brought a phone. We cannot entirely blame Aron for thisâ€”bad things happen to people, especially when alone in the mountainous wilderness.This film by British filmmaker Danny Boyle goes in-depth with this remarkable yet ludicrous true story. James Franco plays Aron as a happy-go-lucky, charismatic guy. Even in peril, he knows how to make the audience laugh, cry, and even move them. This performance is definitely Franco's crown jewel and his Oscar nomination was well earned. The style of story and filmmaking is perfect for Mr. Boyle. The use of choppy editing, jump cuts, overexposed lighting, time lapses, and occasional bursts of loud sound effects and music is reminiscent of his past works. It fits well for this kind of movie. The majority of the film takes place in the canyon where Aron is trapped. To keep it going, hallucinations and flashbacks are added as Aron struggles to survive. This works for a while but after an hour it becomes dull. No doubt it is hard to do a movie about one man's survivalâ€”look no further than Tom Hanks in 'Cast Away.' The problem with these kinds of films is that it goes on longer than necessary and incoherent flashbacks are used as an excuse to add sympathy for the character. I am not saying '127 Hours' is a bad movie. It is a decent one. But for 94 minutes, it drags on like a three-hour film. This may have been intentional to emphasis the seemingly endless time that Aron suffers. But when I start to see subliminal cuts of Scooby Doo and Gatorade commercials, I have reached my limit.'127 Hours' is not a movie for everyone. The big critics love it and the mindless masses find it distasteful. In my opinion, it is neither. It is good, but not great. I will forewarn that the amputation scene is one of the goriest moments I have ever seen in cinemaâ€”and I sat through 'The Passion of the Christ'. This is definitely not for the faint of heart.",7,0,1,3 July 2012
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Choppy but good
","From the three X-Men films that have been made, I've shared mixed feelings towards them. I thought the first was good, the second excellent, and the last one poor. To catch up on what filmmakers have decided to do with another X-Men, I went to see it. Personally, it was not a bad film, nor was it amazing.I've never read the comic books, but I found the movie's take on Wolverine's story to be very interesting, particularly with how the open titles run as Wolverine and his brother Victor Creed fight together during the different wars, beginning with the Civil War and into Vietnam. The visual effects and the work of the cinematographer made this sequence stunning, turning what would be a boring part of the film into an important aspect of it. The one hour and forty-seven minute film did fly by, and the plot did feel choppy, but it managed to hold together, covering a lot about Wolverine's life as well as tying in some things that were left in the dark about the other films. I wish the movie was longer so to go more in-depth about his life, but then again, it's an action flick, not an action drama. The overall performances were good. Hugh Jackman, once again, is fearless as Logan/Wolverine, and Liev Shreiber, as his brother Victor Creed is equally as stunning. Lynn Collins as Silverfox is also a nice addition. But the other supporting characters did not do much for me. They were there, but before they could be developed, they are either killed off or are not shown again. In fact, some of the supporting characters had no real point to the film, for an example, Gambit. All he does is fight in one meaningless battle against Wolverine and flies an airplane at the end. And for a movie that has plenty of great CGI, the effects used on Patrick Stewart in his surprise appearance is absolutely horrible. I know he's getting up there on age, but using visual effects to make him look younger was a horrible idea. Other than these few quagmires, I found myself enjoying the film. My rating: *** out of ****",7,1,2,3 June 2009
Alexander," A Bold and Authentic Alexander: the Cut
","I first saw this film in theaters on opening day and I thought I wasted three hours of my life. But when Oliver Stone claimed that there would release a Director's cut version of Alexander, I was willing to give it another try. And I have to say it, I actual enjoyed it. It is hard to depict such a man as Alexander. This film, did the near impossible. In my opinion, it does not really have one specific genre, but multiple ones. I mean, the film had multiple story lines from Alexander's personal thoughts, his family, the journey, and his friends of warriors around him. I am totally impressed that Stone has squeezed this all in within three hours and forty minutes.So, the film is done in past tense with Old Ptolemy, forty years after Alexander's death, telling the tale of him to a scribe, for historical purposes. So, the narration of Old Ptolemy played by the wonderful Anthony Hopkins, begins it with important, but non interfering information.The film reveals (as the original) his two parents. His mother, Olympias brutally ambitious and rather paranoid, played by Jolie, (whom still could have had some make up to make her look older), and his father Philip, who was a one-eyed, drunk, and did not give into affection easily, played by the famous Val Kilmer. Both of these two cast members in my opinion were wisely chosen and helped the film greatly, making it believable.The film jumps around from the young Alexander learning the cruelty of the myths and the wisdom of Aristotle, played by the ancient Chris Plummer, the adolescent who faces the trouble of not having the crown as king with his father, and the adult Alexander, played by Colin Farrel, who starts off already years into his campaign to rule the world meeting King Darius of Persia at the Battle of Gaugamela, one of the best battles I have ever seen! The film follows Alexander with all of these events, leading him from Perisa, to Bactria and India, marrying Roxanne (Rosario Dawson) and his relationships with his friends and comrades, especially his lover Hephestian (Jareed Leto) whom loses faith and question his purpose of his journey.With this, I have to mention though there are frequent flashbacks that show his adolescence occurring during his adulthood. Many people criticze this for making the film choppy, out of order, and off topic and even confusing, but I find each flashback exactly timely and not confusing at all; for they usually occur after a serious event that has happened in his adulthood, bringing forth Alexander's past memories as an adolescent (which has been neatly placed together in the director's cut). Even more so, these flashbacks hold some powerful scenes that expresses the true natures of his parents, particularly the manipulation and deceit that Angelina Jolie played very well.With this at hand, Stone reveals a more in-depth and psychological version of Alexander, who lives as the naive young boy who 'puruse his dream heading east' and bases his glory off of the Greek myths, which were well incorporated into the film, expressing the 'suffering and eternal glory'.A studier of Greek mythology myself, I found this to be fascinating of how well it aided in the ambivalence that Alexander felt. Unfortunately though, not everyone understands the morals and importance of myths and tragedies, especially Greek. Bottom line, I have to break some hearts, this is not a 'popcorn loving' film like King Arthur or Troy, but more of a thought-provoking film (as was the original cut). And I also have to add that the homosexuality remains. This easily was another criticism upon the film, but I have to say that I found it rather touching and more emotional than before, (since Alexander had a male companion), it felt more realistic for the film, no let down there. Everything in this new version held its true beauty, especially with the pretty and enhanced music of Vangelis, the colorful cinematography, (especially the India battle of turning red, revealing death and bloodshed), the costumes and settings were grand, and the acting was more believable (Colin Farrel still gave gave an actual adequate performance). And the few battles in the film were absolutely outstanding and longer. They are in the league of violence as Gladiator and more strategically based, rather than a bunch of men charging into their deaths as in Braveheart or Sparacus. because of the strategy and 'choppyness' as the negative critics call it, makes them more exciting and intense than any battles I have seen since The Lord of the Rings films.However, I wish the film expressed more with his journey, such as the Greek Nations and Egypt, but it is hard to do for such a grand epic in a specific amount of time, and the time of the film itself drags in places, making the film slow. Otherwise, i was deeply satisfied.****1/2 out of ***** Thumbs up Stone! It disappoints me of how people can't just appreciate such a film.",9,1,3,2 February 2007
Troy," The Direcotr's Cut: Improved, but still not perfect
","Now that I have seen Troy: The Director's Cut four times, I have come to my conclusion of whether I liked this version over the theatrical or not. Most directors' cuts improve the original release such as: Blade Runner, and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I enjoy this version of Troy more than the theatrical, but only slightly.The story is the same. The following morning of the peaceful pact between Sparta and Troy, Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) loves Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger) and decides to take her with him to his home Troy. Her husband Menelhaus (Brendan Gleeson) learns about this betrayal and decides to go to war with the Trojans, aided by the support of his power hungry brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox) who recruits the greatest warrior of the world Achilles (Brad Pitt) to partake in the war that launches a thousand ships. King Priam (Peter O'Toole) and his eldest son Prince Hector (Eric Bana) must defend their city from the Greeks onslaught.Compared to the theatrical version, which to me was just a big budget action flick, there are scenes added in the film that help develop the character's revealing their motives. For instance, there's an added scene where King Priam tells his son Hector a story about him as a baby when he was sick. He told him he prayed to the Gods and made a promise to them that if they saved him, he would dedicate his life to them. When young Hector's health improved, Priam says, 'Since then I've dedicated my life to the Gods. I've worked thirty years for peace.' The reason why he fears and respects the Gods so much is explained. There are several other scenes like this that makes the characters more believable and more understanding.There are other scenes that may not have been extended, but rearranged via editing. An example would be in a scene where Briesis first meets Achilles, bound by the wrists in his tent. Rather than cutting back and forth between Achilles talking to her and her talking to him, the screen focuses only on her. The scene is not longer, but it draws its main attention on her. In the theatrical version of Troy, I found the battle sequences to be very entertaining, but at times unrealistic with the sometimes bloodless slashes, choppy camera angles, and occasional overuse of CGI. I was surprised it got the R rating. But this version rubs the battles in your face, very much like Mel Gibson's Braveheart. The blood/gore fans will enjoy this very much. There are several other things that have been changed in this new version. The colorization is brighter than the theatrical version. The statue of Apollo is a gold rather than bronze. This also makes the blood stand out more. The score by James Horner is broader, adding more drama and emotion to the film. It is very similar to the theatrical version, but the pieces are rearranged and a little bit of a Gabriel Yared feeling (the original composer for the film) is added to it. This had quite a positive effect on the film. However, the music during the duel between Hector and Achilles is totally different. Rather than a solo drum supporting the suspense of the fight, an entire group of drums and other instruments are at work, drowning the scene rather than allowing the fight on the screen do most of the work. As I've said earlier, many scenes added make the movie better. But there are also scenes added that had no purpose to the film. There's an added scene following Paris ecstasy with Helen in which hector confronts Paris. He questions him about who he was sleeping with. Paris lies but Hector doesn't buy it. Instead, he grabs him by the face and tells him that if he ever messed up the peaceful pact with Sparta, he would 'rip his pretty face from his skull.' This gives the implication that he knew about his brother and Helen, which does not add the surprising revelation on the boat in the theatrical version. This also shows that Hector knew about the affair, yet he didn't straighten it out. I found that to be weak on his part, particularly as such a wise and honorable man who would do anything for his country.I also found the rearrangement of Hector's funeral to be unneeded. Rather than Horner's score flourish, an annoying female soloist sings her heart out, sounding like a chicken being choked. Every time I come across this scene, I skip it, because I might just scream.Overall, the director's cut is better, but it is still flawed. Nonetheless, out of Wolfgang Peterson's effort to make such a compelling story, I give it a 9/10. The myth by Homer will always be the best version.",9,2,5,5 April 2008
Spotlight," Powerful and thought provoking
","'Spotlight' is about the Boston Globe's investigation into the allegations of child abuse by some of the priests in the Catholic Church. In a similar style to 'All the President's Men,' we follow the newspaper's team as they uncover awful truths and cover-ups. The story presents a bit more of a personal touch for the main characters as we observe how they are affected, and ultimately impacted from what they discover. In part, this is what makes 'Spotlight' such a compelling and thought-provoking film. The scenes where the victims share their stories are powerful and heart rendering. Even though the investigation keeps the movie's plot moving steadily, it is the performances that make the film memorable. Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo stand out in particular. Their characters are opposite ends of the spectrum. Ruffalo is passionate and intense as Mike Rezendes whereas Keaton is more reserved and calm as Will Robby Robinson. Both mold into their roles so well that I failed to see them as actors. The rest of the cast is sublime, even Rachel McAdams as the emotionally attached Sacha Pfeiffer.'Spotlight' is a great movie. It is engaging, powerful, compelling, and thought provoking. The film will leave you with much to think about, especially if you attend an organized religion.",9,2,3,1 January 2016
Terminator Salvation," At least I saw it...
","Even though 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines' was a bomb, I still had faith that Hollywood could resurrect the Terminator series into something great again. But when thirty minutes into the film, with a script that is mainly made up of the phrases 'big explosions', 'futuristic car chases', and 'machines attacking' there's a problem. 'Terminator Salvation' ran into the same issue that 'Quantum of Solace' had, first-class special effects and action, but a poor script. I personally did not like 'Terminator 3', but I find that, that is a better film. It at least had a plot, not a great one, but it had one. Salvation just has one big action sequence after another. Hooray for the technical people, but boo for the scriptwriter. Acting wise, the only actor who was at work was Sam Worthington. He's a good protagonist, one that could be cheered on, but he alone can't carry a film. Christian Bale, one busy actor with one success after another has led me to wonder how he even volunteered for this film. His acting, which he can be pretty good at, is over-dramatic and bland. It was also nice to see Michael Ironside in a film again, but for the few minutes he's on screen, he seemed bored, as did the other cast members. And I will point that I liked the Arnold cameo towards the end of the movie. What 'Terminator 3' did to the series is damage it. What 'Terminator Salvation' did was pulverize it, but at least I saw it. My rating, a generous * out of ***.",3,3,5,3 June 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," A stupid disaster film that is too modern for world events!
","Most disaster films are lame, but have great action sequences of disaster, especially Independence day, which is probably my favorite. this would be an enjoyable disaster film, but it is not so. the reasons way are so many. one reason is because there was not enough destruction shown like in Independence day, the film was too predictable of what was going to happen, unlike Independence day, for me. The film was also too realistic with politicians, which we do not want to here about anymore with the upcoming 2004 election. Especially of having an actor as the vice-president who looked like Dick Chenny, showing a bad influence on the republicans, and plus of having the death of the president. i was interested though of how the next ice age was to form, but after the first hour of the flooding of new York, and the wind storms of L.A. I was bored. it was purty much after that a survival story. I think that Dennis Quaid should have died. I'm kind of tired of him. After the Alamo was released, i was less interested in seeing him act. plus, the film itself was lame, not making much sense. Great effects though! 4 out of 10 from me.",4,0,1,5 June 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Just amazing!
","I have to say right off the bat that this is the best of the Pirates trilogy. The first half hour is a little odd and unclear, but when Johnny Depp arrives on the big screen, he once again is the witty Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp once again lights up the show with his charm, but also with a more serious and unusual split personalities.The rest of cast was outstanding! A new darker light is shined upon them, from despicable villains such as the heartless Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) to the overachieving and irritating Lord Becket (Tom Hollander). Orlando Bloom as Will Turner is no longer an 'all good boy' like the previous films, but more deceptive and cunning, and Keira Knightley as the flamboyant Elizabeth Swann makes herself stand out from being a typical damsel in distress to a heroic pirate leader. The appearance of Keith Richards, Chow Yun-Fat, and many other faces were also grand.The near three hour film flew by rather like a two hour film, with more intense action sequences, supported with some of the most unique and best CGI effects I have ever seen. Along with this, the film holds a good plot, revealing many secrets, a few twists, and ties many of the plot holes that the second film left off. But the very ending is left as a cliffhanger, leaving room for another pirate film.And if you thought the second pirate film was not so 'sugarcoated', well this one doesn't have much sugar to it. There is a substantial amount of good humor, but the film is darker with a more mysterious plot and powerful score by the ultimate Hans Zimmer. There are no complaints I can give this film.This is the first 10/10 I have given this year! Don't wait! See it!",9,3,7,2 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Good, but not great...
","The first Spider-man was simply great. But I felt the second one slacked off a bit. So, I was not sure if this one would deliver like the original or flop or the second one. It's neither horrible nor great. Here's why.The Good: For starters, I was again impressed by Tobey McGuire's acting talent as Peter Parker/Spider-man. It was even more exciting to see a 'darker' look at Spider-man, from the mysterious 'black suit'. I honestly thought Tobey would not be able to pull off being bad, but he filled it in; despite the fact it felt slightly awkward for such a hero to turn evil, even if it was temporarily.-I never really thought of James Franco as a good actor. To me, he was like a bland, three-dimensional individual. But in this film, he redeems himself not only as being a better actor, but also shows a villainous side of Harry Osborne, henceforth, the New Goblin. The fight between both Parker and Osborne was a strong point to the film that was quite satisfying.-Thomas Hayden Church (who reminds me of Lee Marvin junior) was a very good villain as the ill-tempered Sandman. There's a sense of feeling for his character, which he delivers as a quite ambivalent individual who is stuck between right and wrong, but is given an unlikely power. Basically, he's not a stereotype villain; he's not all evil or all good.-The CGI is triumphant over the first two films. I haven't seen such good visual effects since Peter Jackson's King Kong! It was not stylized like the previous Spidey films, but more on the cooler and a bit on the realistic side. It did not look fake at all. With the help of such great visuals, it broadened the action sequences very well, making them intense and glamorous to watch on the big screen.-In the mix of the film, there was some good humor put forth extremely well by J.K. Simmons. He was flat-out hysterical, once again as J. Jonah Johnson.The Bad: The damaging flaw to this film is the story lines. Yes, it holds to Spider-man fighting 'the evil within', but the film leaves plenty of plot holes as to where the 'black suit' came from. There's no explanation to this mystery. Even more so agonizing was that the screenwriters and the director tried to cram so much into the film, including: Sandman, Harry Osborne/the New Goblin, the 'black suit', Parker's strained relationship with MJ, Gwen Stacey, and Venom. It all grew very tiresome after the first hour. It did not mesh together at the end in an organized fashion.-Added to this, the film had the tendency of not only dragging, but also choppy, jumping from one side story to another. It was a headache, and to a disappointment, the action sequences were relatively few, making the pace even slower. The two hour and twenty minute film felt like a three hour film. Even if the director wanted to make a four movie of this, it still would not have turned out right. It needed to be two separate films all together (some of which could have been added to the second Spidey).-Topher Grace right off the bat was a wrong choice for Venom/ Eddie Brock. Instead of being a vicious character, he was an annoying laugh riot. Every time I saw him on the screen, I wanted to laugh, because his acting was so lame. Even worse was some of the most important aspects of the film were rather corny and poorly done (which I will not mention), while other scenes, particularly at the end were left hanging and needed to wrap-up the film.Overall: I liked this Spider-man. It had a potential, but it was nothing spectacular. It lacked the knots needed to tie all the plot(s). It's a good popcorn-loving film. But Spider-man fans, don't expect a triumph like the first one.7/10",7,0,0,15 May 2007
Zodiac," It felt more like a made for T.V. special on PBS rather than a real film
","When it comes to making a film based on an event like the 'Zodiac killer', there comes a question in which most filmmakers ask themselves, 'Should the film be more factual or more fictional?' Hand's down, this movie is by far more fact than fiction! David Fincher, best known for 'Seven' and 'Panic Room' brings to life the chain events, covering over a twenty year time frame, of the five vicious murders that happened in the four districts of Western California. The movie goes in-depth with police detectives who investigated the crimes, and the reporters who queried and tried to seek the actual killer. The ensemble cast of Mark Ruffalo, Jake Gyllenhall, Robert Downey Jr., and Anthony Edwards are excellent.The combination of the accurate stories and the cast members make a great film, but 'Zodiac' needed more than that. It needed a thrilling pace like 'Panic Room'. The first hour of the film was steady, but after that, the film dragged and drifted from different scenes about prank callers, kooks on the street who claim their the 'Zodiac killer', and far-fetched theories that both the police and the news reporters try to figure out with absolutely no luck.I grew very bored. For awhile, I felt like was watching a 'made for T.V. special on PBS' rather than a movie. However, the last twenty minutes of the film followed into the suspense that Mr. Fincher is very well known for and he managed to tie a fair amount of the knots at the end, leaving some plot holes. I honestly felt there wasn't enough mysterious drama or suspense to make the movie a real good thriller.7/10",7,0,0,5 August 2007
The Prestige," There is more to it than meets the eye...
","I saw this film this afternoon with an open-mind, having no clue as to what it was about it. Seeing a few of Chris Nolan's movies, I knew it was going to be good. Boy, it blew me way away! i'll try not to give too much of the story away, (for it is so cunning and amazing with scheming). It's about two magicians in competition (Jackman) and (Bale) who try to gain fortune and glory, but also learn and reveal to the masses of the ultimate magic trick. both set off in a face/off of lies, deceit, obsession, greed, pride, and murder that can lead to serious consequences. That's all I'm going to reveal of the story, for it is so cunning and amazing with scheming that when yo think you've figured it out...think again! It has a powerful all-star cast. Hugh Jacman and Christain Bale were an awesome couple of foes, who deserve some recognition in the Oscars. especially Jackman, for he plays a very ambivalent character; not to mention the rest, Scarlett Johansen was both good-looking and had talent, Michael Caine was absolutely fabulous, which he always was, and a surprise guest star of Andy Serkis was also really decent in his role.The film-making was mind-blowing, with realistic looking visual effects, that didn't look CGI, even though they probably were, the set-decoration and costume design, was vivid, and the music score gave a very depressing, but moving feeling, that made the film flow even more. However, the film made unexpected changes from scene to another with a lot of choppy editing, which came very untimely, making the film very confusing and hard to follow. The pace was also relatively slow, for the two hour film felt more like three hours.otherwise, this is one of this year's best films! it has pretty much everything a good film needs, acting, story, and film-making quality. Chris Nolan has pulled it off again! ***1/2 out of **** See it, it is worthwhile!",9,1,1,28 October 2006
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A great comeback!
","Is it just me or does it seem that many sequels these days are better than the original? X-Men 2, The Dark Knight, Chamber of Secrets, Prince Caspian, to name a few. 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army' is one of them.I liked the first Hellboy, but it didn't blow my shirt off as a great fantasy/superhero film. Hell-boy 2 however is a great comeback. The action sequences are bigger and better. The CGI is amazing. And the story is wittier.I like all the good guys, and they're more alive and enjoyable to watch in this sequel. Ron Perlman as Hellboy is funny and a good hero, but he's also a character drawn between what to do with his girlfriend and sidekick Liz (Selma Blair) who has some secrets of her own. This adds a little bit of humor to the movie. Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) is not just a smart 'fish man' who likes listening to classical music and has the unusual power to see and sense things in the past and future, but he's also a hero who has trouble putting business before pleasure from the damsel in distress Princess Nuala (Ann Walton).The movie also introduces a power driven villain Prince Nuada, played wonderfully by Luke Goss and has annoying yet rather funny new sidekick Johann Krauss (voiced by Family Guy's Seth Macfarlane).Unlike most action flicks, this film has a creative director and screenwriter (Guillermo Del Toro) that has the ability to bring an imaginary world to life. So, Hellboy 2 is a movie to see by fans and even for people who aren't. The only people who would not like this movie are those who either don't like fantasy or have no imagination. 8/10",8,0,2,24 July 2008
The Hateful Eight," Merely decent
","A winter storm sweeps through the mountainous Wyoming valley as eight individuals shelter in a log cabin. Each person seems upfront and friendly, but not all of them are who they claim to be. The characters include John Ruth (Kurt Russell), a bounty hunter bringing in Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) a crazy little minx, to hang; Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), also a bounty hunter collecting some reward money, a town sheriff (Walter Goggins), the town's hangman (Tim Roth), a former colonel (Bruce Dern), and the cabin's caretaker (Damien Bicher). In a 'who done it' storytelling fashion, the characters figures out the hidden truths and turn on another one.Writer and director Quentin Tarantino approaches his eighth film like a play. He takes his time unraveling the story as the characters engage in idle conversations through the blustery storm. QT is a master of witty dialog and has a talent where he can have his characters talk endlessly about irrelevant matters to the movie's plot, yet remain entertaining and enthralling. While this worked flawlessly in 'Inglourious Basterds' and 'Django Unchained,' in 'The Hateful Eight' it drags the story out longer than necessary. After awhile, the dialog feels very long-winded. If Tarantino wanted to emphasize the boredom of being secluded in a cabin during a storm, he certainly achieves that. There are still some very well written scenes though, such as a reoccurring gag where each character asks John Ruth why he is bringing Daisy in alive when it is just simpler to shoot her in the back. The punch line, 'It's too much work to bring 'em in alive' will go down as a classic Tarantino movie line.Without giving too much more away, the 'surprise' twist is very predictable. In Tarantino style, people die gruesomely. Shot, stabbed, hanged, poisoned, bled to death, take your pick. Unlike other QT movies where the violence seems justified, 'The Hateful Eight' depicts violence just for the sake of it. The last on-camera death specifically displays a disturbing act of pure sadism. I never really felt uncomfortable watching a Tarantino movie. This one actually bothered me a little.There are some more worthwhile factors that 'The Hateful Eight' offers. Shot in 70mm film, the landscape shots pay homage to the old Westerns. Cinematographer Robert Richardson has once again shown his talent as one of Hollywood's greatest DPs. Ennio Morricone's score is haunting to say the least, but also has the soul he created from the Spaghetti Westerns. Both are probably in luck for some Oscar nominations this year.To sum up, 'The Hateful Eight' is merely decent. The acting is good. The technical skills are phenomenal. But the story is weak, but fortunately has some of the flare QT that audiences have seen before, just not enough to make another masterpiece.",8,0,10,7 January 2016
We Were Soldiers," Sad, brutal-yet a very well-made war picture...
","I was reluctant to see 'We Were Soldiers' at first because I thought it was just another bloody war picture about heroism like 'Saving Private Ryan.' More than six years after its release, for the heck of it, I lent a copy from my local library. This movie is much more than about heroism and patriotism. For the first time I saw in a war film, the story focuses not only on the battlefield, but also on the men's families and wives, as they face fear of the knock on the door from a cabbie, telling them that their husband died in combat. This added a great deal of emotion to the characters of the film. I don't feel just sorry for the soldiers receiving gruesome deaths, but for their wives and children that they'll never see again. In a sense, this makes the film an anti-war picture. There maybe courageous acts and bravery in war, but it always comes with a heavy price.The lead and supporting actors were all diligent in their roles. Mel Gibson is not the typical action hero that I had expected from 'The Patriot' or the 'Lethal Weapons'. He's a man in a hellish war in which he focuses not just on his own survival, but also for his men. I rank his performance in this as one of his best. I'm disappointed that he didn't at least a golden globe nomination in 2002. Director Randall Wallace, who helped Mel with 'Braveheart', is wonderful as a director. He captures some intense and brutal battle scenes that are amazing, yet at times hard to watch (particularly with the napalm sequence). Dean Semler's photography is sweeping, plastering beautiful surroundings that are swamped by war. Nick Glennie-Smith's score has a triumphant sound, but at the same time is haunting. This develops a grim mood for the film. And lastly, I was thoroughly impressed with the sound effects editors. From what I saw on a documentary, all the gunshots and explosions were recorded after filming. They did a hell of a job making the audio fit the video. Bravo! 'We Were Soldiers' is a superb film that reminds everyone not only the horrors of war (both on the battlefield and at home), but also the courage men in the past and today are willing to take for our nation.",9,5,9,22 September 2008
Crash," Best of 2005!!!
","There haven't been many impressive films of 2005, but this one is beyond exceptional. Moving! Captivating! Engaging! Tear-jerking! Extraordinary! I can give nothing but high marks for this film. It covers a thirty-six hour range of every day individuals of different ethnic backgrounds and day-to-day struggles, who knock in and out of each other's lives. It is an exploration of a roller coaster of emotions involving racial tensions and poverty, (which play a big part in the film and in our society), personal, conflicting inner struggles of what's right and wrong, and the violent actions that lead to consequences. The story starts with an aftermath of several people who are involved in a multi-car accident. From that point, the film goes back thirty-six hour before the crash, revealing the lives of several characters, and the problems each of them encounter during that day. An LAPD cop (Matt Dillon) is trying to get medical help for his father, but he is having problems with a black HMO clerk who won't give his father permission to see another doctor. He in turn takes out his frustration on a black couple during a traffic stop (Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard). A socialite (Sandra Bullock) and District Attorney (Brandon Fraser) are carjacked at gunpoint by two black teenagers (Ludacris and Larenz Tate). Sandra takes out her anger on a Mexican locksmith (Michael Pena) who is changing the door locks to their home. Later that night, the locksmith is again robbed of his dignity by a Persian store-owner (Shuan Toab) who decides to take matters into his own hands. Many of the characters switch from being bad-person-to-hero in ways that are surprising and shocking. All these little plots and many more blend together and kept me interested for the two hours. It made me laugh, cry, and sometimes paralyzed. It is unlike any other movie I have seen. The all-star cast made the film believable, unlike a soap opera which was my original expectation of this film.The music score was haunting and emotionally driven (very much like Michael Mann's Heat). The script of the movie is brilliant. The movie jumped around a bit, but the editing is done very creatively, not making me confused at all. The cinematography is beautiful. And above all each cast members' performance made the film on a major success! Crash is easily the best film of 2005! Underneath our aggression, wickedness, and sarcasm, we are all human, and no one is higher or better than another whether by race, belief, or class. ***** out of *****",10,2,6,30 October 2007
The Expendables," Exactly what I hoped for.
","I haven't seen a really good, hardcore, shoot 'em bang 'em up action flick in a long time. When I went to see this movie with a couple of buddies, that's what I was hoping for. My wish came true. As a kid, I have grown up watching the big action heroes portrayed by Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Statham, Li, and many more. Seeing close to a dozen action stars together in one movie is a real treat. All of the actors do not just deliver classic one-liners, brutal action sequences, and plenty of testosterone and macho attitudes, but they also immerse themselves into their characters. It's easy to love the tough good guys and hate the cruel bad guys. Unfortunately, Schwarzenegger and Willis only receive mere cameos, but at least they were present in the film. I will note that Schwarzenegger, however, gets the best intro and exit of any character in the movie. The action sequences is another thing worth noting; they're not only great, but the immerse CGI adds a somewhat stylized/cartoonish look to them. There's a somewhat 300 style to the violence in the excessive blood splatter, yet no slow motion is used. Instead, all of the action is very quick and crisply editedâ€”this makes it hard to keep up with the body count I might add. In regards to plot, do not expect much. I predicted it all from the beginning, but there is a nice twist that I didn't see coming at the end. I don't hold this against the movie though, because plot is not its purpose. The film's goal is to provide mindless actionâ€”the perfect escapism. That's what I like about this film. When this comes out on DVD, I'll certainly pick it up and if Stallone decides to do a sequel, I'll definitely go see it on the big screen. The one thing that I did not like about this movie is the sound design. My buddies and I noticed that the music and effects were very loud, but the dialog was real quiet. I have nothing wrong with loud explosions and gunshots in a film, but I do not appreciate quiet dialogâ€”which is supposed to be the most important aspect of sound in cinema. Other than this, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. If mindless, bloody, hardcore action with tough guys as the heroes is your fetish, then go see this movie!",8,12,22,15 September 2010
MASH," People call it a classic, I call it just okay
","I've never seen the television show, so I did not know what to expect from the movie. First off, I have to say this could have easily been mistaken as a film about Vietnam. The men are busy chasing nurses, doing drugs, spreading humors and innuendos, armed with the 'free love' hippie attitude, and wearing flashy clothes. The only thing that gives a hint that this is the Korean War was the line on the screen by Eisenhower, 'and then there was Korea.' Perhaps this is because the release was in 1970, during the Vietnam War. Umm? People call this movie a classical American comedy. It is not the kind of comedy that I anticipated and relish like the slapstick humor of the Three Stooges or the satire of Monty Python. The humor is aimed for an adult audience; I understand the humor and got a few chuckles out of it, but I did not laugh to the point I was choking or crying. I also understand the big deal people made out of M.A.S.H, since it promoted the humor that is in Wedding Crashers and in most television sitcoms. Compared to those though, the ensemble cast is brilliant.MASH is a good diversion and will be remembered for a long time. But, it is not quite my favorite cup of tea. 7/10",7,3,7,22 March 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Tim's unique vision is brought to life with Logan's script and Depp's performance!
","I've never seen the play so I did not know what to expect from Sweeny Todd. Directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp, I had a feeling that it was going to be something out of the ordinary. Now that I have seen the movie, it was unusual and even bizarre; however, I really got a kick out of the two hours.Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a simple tale about a man named Barker (Johnny Depp) who is wrongfully accused of a crime he did not commit, which was plotted by an evil judge (Alan Rickman) who wanted Barber's wife for his own.Fifteen years later, Barker returns with the alias Sweeney Todd and seeks vengeance for the man who wronged him with the help of his landlady Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bohman Carter).The direction by Tim Burton and the script by John Logan deliver a sheer genius movie with vivid characterization and a fresh tale of murder, vengeance, and implications of cannibalism. This is a very dark and gruesome movie; it is definitely not a one for the squeamish. Sweeney at ease slits the throats of his victims and drops the bodies down a trapdoor, leaving them for his accomplice so to get rid of the evidence.Simultaneously though, I found some of the violence rather comical. The blood squirts and sprays profusely in gallons at a time from the slit throats as if a bottle of red cool aid was cut open. It was overdone in a funny, but a disgusting way like in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Nonetheless, it was bit of the top for me, particularly at the tragic ending.The set-decoration, costumes, and make up were absolutely exquisite. The cinematography set the dark and grim atmosphere of the tale of vengeance and the music was downright fantastic. It flowed with the film's plot and shaped its tone. Unlike The Sound of Music, which carried the same cheerful and uplifting sound, the music for this film had several different tunes to it. It was haunting, dramatic, suspenseful, and even at times upbeat. I enjoyed all the songs, particularly 'The Worst Pies in London' and 'Pretty Women'.Once again, Johnny Depp shines as among one of Hollywood's most influential actors. Honestly, there has not been a role of his that I did not like. But I have to say though that this a bit of a different role for Mr. Depp. From the movies I have seen him in like the Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy he plays the guy that is lovable. In this, I liked his character not because he was a hero or funny, but due to how scary he was. The intense and insane look in his eyes as the vengeful Sweeney gives me memories of Jack Nicholson in The Shining. He is brilliant as Sweeney, a guy who no one would want to cross.However, since this is a musical, Depp reveals that he wouldn't be the next star on American Idol. Rather than singing, he speaks and shouts with the melody. At least he tried though. The other really impressive performance was by Helena Bohman Carter as Mrs. Lovett. Her character is the exact opposite of Depp: likable, very humorous, and has a pleasant singing voice. Alan Rickman was also another nice addition to the movie. He's always played a great villain, and he was definitely a good one in this movie.I'm highly impressed with this movie. But I give it a 9/10 due to Johnny Depp's lack of singing talent and the over the top violence.",9,3,5,4 January 2008
Malcolm X," The Denzel Washing Show
","Malcolm X is considered one of the most influential and brave individuals recorded in history. After being dead for more than twenty years, he has been brought back by a stunning and electrifying performance by Denzel Washington. Not only has Denzel proved to be one of the best actors in Hollywood, but he also can make any person believe in him.The movie is well-researched and well captured by Spike Lee. It covered a whole lot in the three hour and twenty minute film from Malcolm's youth to his assassination. The costume design by Ruth E. Carter added much to the authenticity of the time period. The work of editing and cinematography was also a nice addition to the film.Despite such authenticity and a performance by Denzel, it does not make it a classic. Even though much is covered in the film, it got boring. The first hour covers his youth as a pimp, gambler, drug abuser, and sex addict. Nothing really exciting happens until he is sent to prison and learns of the Muslim religion. From there on, it kicks off.But after awhile, even his role in politics gets dull. As I said, Denzel is powerful in his performance, but yet I can't help but see him as a shouting figurehead in when he delivers his speeches. I've seen documented footage of Malcolm X, and he did have an accelerated voice. Denzel really made the movie, but he kind of went a bit over the top.It's not a bad movie, but not great either. 7/10",7,2,6,24 April 2008
The Town," The contemporary Heat
","'The Town' is very much the contemporary 'Heat.' The story is pretty similar; a crew of four men who take down scores, all the while with law enforcement hot on their tails. Yet, there's a new flavor to the plot. One of these members (Ben Affleck) romances a bank manager (Rebecca Hall) from the last score they took down. This addition to the story makes it more interesting, for it adds both romance and tension. Will Ben Affleck's character say something that will take him and his crew down because of this woman? Will the woman figure out who he is? Will he come clean and tell her who he is? All of these questions make for a great movie. The performances are solid. The actors make the sympathy lie with the robberies and our disgust with the police, especially with Jeremy Renner as the loose cannon Jem and John Hamm as the lead FBI investigator. I even liked Ben Affleck in this movie, whom I'm not a big fan of. He proves himself both a decent actor and a witty director. The only problem I had with this film is some of the plot holes and the lack of common sense in some of the characters. For instance, why do the robbers stay in Boston and not hit other cities to help trip up the police? When the feds are closing in, why don't they tap the phones of the robbers? They very easily could have caught them all before the big, bloody finale. Then again, this is Hollywood. As viewers, we have to suspend our disbelief for two hours when seeing a movie. Even so, little things like these nag me throughout the movie. Nevertheless, 'The Town' is a good movie to watch. It has enough humor, action, violence, suspense, and drama to make it move at a solid pace.My rating: *** out of ****",8,0,0,3 September 2011
Shutter Island," Another great film by Scorsese and his team, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece
","For starters, I'll say that 'Shutter Island' is not a horror flick that the trailers have painted it as. Rather, it is a psychological thriller. I won't delve too deeply into the film's plot but I will say that it is unique, and from what I've heard, is pretty accurate to the novel by Dennis Lehane, (whom I was blown away by his novel 'Mystic River'). What makes the movie so unique is that you don't know what's coming (unless you've read the novel), very much like 'The Usual Suspects', but without Keiser Soze. Needless to say, it makes the movie interesting, but you know, I just have to get this off my chest, about half way into the film, I guessed the ending, and sure enough, I was correct. This isn't a bad thing, but when you have feeling on how the story is going to end, you want it to get from point A to point B without dragging it out. Other than this personal feeling, I enjoyed the movie.Once again, Leo Dicaprio has proved himself a talented and awesome actor that illuminates the screen. It was also nice to see other, coming of age actors such as Max Von Sydow, Patricia Clarkson and Ben Kingsley dazzle on the screen. Even Mark Ruffalo, whom I'm not a huge fan of, did a great job. And the technical aspects, such as the beautiful, low-key lighting, cinematography, haunting score, visual effects, and a dim set design adds more to the flavor of the dark, disturbing, and intense atmosphere of the film's plot. I could also tell that this was definitely a Scorsese film, even without his name plastered on all the television previews by the sharp quick pans and edit cuts, the attractive static shots of buildings, and the sudden low and high levels of sound effects and music pitches. That is Scorsese's style, and I love it, though the musical score could have been turned down a notchÂ…it does not need to be blaring. We know it's a suspenseful movie, don't remind us. 'Shutter Island' is another great film by Scorsese and his team, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece like 'Goodfellas', 'Taxi Driver' or even 'The Departed'. And be forewarned, this is not a movie for everyone. Though it's not a horror flick, there's a lot of disturbing content throughout the film that is not for the faint of heart. Then again, every other film by Scorsese isn't for the faint heart, but it's much more shocking to see in this movie, because it's not a typical mafia shoot em up bang em up that Scorsese is prone to making. ***1/2/****",9,1,4,19 March 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Stands on its own with merit
","Spring is the best season for movies. The romantic comedies and popcorn loving, super hero action flicks flood the theaters. Many times they succeed at the box office. The question for the millions of viewers that flock to these movies though is whether if they are any good--or rather are they worth the price of admission. 'Captain America 2: The Winter's Soldier' is without a doubt a fun, enjoyable movie that takes us deeper into the character of Captain America. It also introduces us to new villains and threats that the hero must overcome. Rather than the cut and dry plot line used in the first 'Captain America,' this one is a mostly well thought out flick. As Captain America achieves greatness in stopping terrorists and more or less bringing world peace, he faces a new challenge that is more subtle and sophisticated. This grows more dire as the head of the organization S.H.I.E.L.D is killed and Captain America himself becomes a target of the organization that he once thought was a friend. Forming an alliance with Black Widow from The Avengers, both seek out the reasoning for this betrayal and who has compromised the organization. Adding additional problems, both are tracked by the deadliest assassinÃ‚â€¦The Winter's Soldier. The movie makes twists and turns, creating a feeling in the viewer that anything can happen to these characters. They are vulnerable and are pitted against odds that would put Iron Man and Thor in a world of hurt. While the film writers of the Marvel Comics Universe do a good job in making an interesting story, they once again have the tenacity of giving us some information and then throwing more questions at the audience. Without giving anything away, more factors are unresolved than completed. This grows very annoying. The biggest problem though is the lack of connection to the other Marvel Comics characters. I understand that each Marvel Super hero requires their own storyline, but that does not mean disregarding the whereabouts of the other characters. I half anticipated Hawkeye and The Hulk to appear as supporting heroes. But no, Captain America and Black Widow are left alone to fight these problems. This is something that I feel needs to be addressed in further Marvel Universe movies. It is unfair to the hero and the lovers of the comics.That all aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this addition to the Marvel Comics Universe. Chris Evans is once again effective as the main protagonist and Scarlett Johansen is sexier than ever as Black Widow. The presence of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury is always an amusement and adding Anthony Mackie as Falcon is a smart plus. Robert Redford takes the mantle as the main villain, which almost seems out of character given his past work. He is more comical than evil. In one scene, where he is disturbed by his housekeeper, he casually tells her that she should have knocked before entering and then kills her. Though intended to be an example of sadism, the delivery of the scene is tongue and cheek. From his deadpan, condescending tone, it is hard to take him seriously. Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier, however, stands as a menacing, calculated bad-ass. He slaughters anyone who gets in his way without a blink of an eye. He is the Terminator meets Darth Vader. His character is much more plausible than Redford. The choreography of the fight scenes are very impressive and do not feel unrealistic or dull. The hand-held camera adds to the chaos of the action, but it grows a bit overburdening on occasion. In the back of my mind, I couldn't wonder if this was an attempt to conceal Chris Evans's stunt doubles. The visual effects are very well done, removing the obvious hints of actors running around on a green screen. Henry Jackman's score is adrenaline pumping and epic. His mentor Hans Zimmer would be proud. 'Captain America 2' may not hold up to the grandeur of The Avengers, but it stands on its own as a decent part of the super hero franchise.",8,3,6,10 May 2014
Life of Pi," Visually and mentally mesmerizing
","'Life of Pi' is unlike any other film about survival that I have ever seen. The film starts with Pi Patel, an adult who is being interviewed by a Canadian writer who wants to write a great book. Told in flashback, Pi reveals his story, starting with his family, his pursuit of studying different religions, and the animals that his father cared for, including a 450-pound Bengal tiger. His family decides to move to Canada to begin a new life. They hitch a ride on a boat that gets caught in a storm. Surviving the sinking, Pi is forced adrift on a 26-foot lifeboatâ€”with an orangutan, a hyena, a zebra, and the Bengal tiger. While the story seems simple enough, there are many deep, religious and philosophical undertones thrown into the mix that puts the viewer in a position to think and wonder. Part of the beauty of this film, is that it can be interpreted in many ways. What I see as the underlying message or theme maybe different than someone else. It is not only a movie worth seeing, but it is also worth discussing. With a great degree of ambiguousness and thought-provoking undercurrents, 'Life of Pi' is supported by magical feats of movie-making. It is a stunning film to look at with breathtaking cinematography, visual effects that are near perfection, and an emotionally driven musical score. The cast is mostly made up of unknowns to the American audience, but they work well in their given roles, specifically Suraj Sharma as young Piâ€”he gives us a character to care for. However, the character I cared for the most though is the Bengal Tiger. It may seem bad to favor a CGI animal over a human actor, but the SFX geniuses of Rhythm & Hues have given us a being to admire and awe. This movie has been a privilege to see in cinema. I am afraid though that it will lose its impact once it is converted to DVD and Blu-Ray, for to truly appreciate its power, 'Life of Pi' is a movie that must be seen on the big screen.",10,4,8,19 December 2012
Ocean's Thirteen," The gangs are all here, yet again...
","The gang is back for a third round. After stealing from Mr. Benedict in 'Ocean's Eleven' and then having to pay him back in 'Ocean's Twelve', what's next? This time, it is not for the money or the girl, but for vengeance.Their next victim is an ego driven hotel manager Willy Banks (Al Pacino). When one of Ocean's eleven players, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), decides to do business with Banks, he cuts him out of a heavy deal, which lands Reuben in the hospital from a sudden heart attack. So the players join together to rebuild Reuben's share of the hotel with what they know bestÂ…a multimillion dollar theft from Bank's hotel.Once again, it is the 'nice guys' against the 'mean guys'. I wouldn't call it 'good guys' vs. 'bad guys' because Ocean and his players are thieves, but they are pleasant people. Helping out a friend is not a common characteristic of a normal thief, and besides, they're charming, hysterical, and handsome fellows.Watching Ocean and all his players again on the big screen was a hearty joy. Observing their various schemes and how they pull off the heist was very entertaining, making a satisfying two hour film go by quickly. The momentary moments of Andy Garcia on the screen as Mr. Benedict were also fun. Although, a new light of Al Pacino as Banks was shown on the screen as a ruthless and heartless 'butthead' surprised me. Perhaps I haven't seen enough movies of Al. He was still excellent as he always is in his roles.However, I missed the appearances of Julie Roberts as Tess, and Catherine Zeta-Jones from 'Ocean's Twelve' as Isabel. It was all the guys this time. And there was one thing that bothered me at the end of the film.After their victory, all of them pulled out cigars and puffed away. Okay, I know having a cigar after doing a deal is a common thing that guys do, but why glamorize it, especially in theaters, which can promote youths to smoking? Which is even worse is the fact that after Reuben recovered from his heart attack; he too was puffing away with them, as if saying 'Okay, give me another heart attack.' That's a slap in the face to the cardiologist! Cigarettes maybe banned from commercial advertisement, but having movies, like this restarts, this advertisement showing cool guys puffing away. It was an entertaining film and a good second sequel. Finale statement, it was better than the second, but not nearly as good as the first one. 8/10",8,2,3,16 July 2007
Interstellar," Creative. Brilliant. Original. The Best of 2014?
","Christopher Nolan's latest film 'Interstellar' is set in the near future where earth is facing an apocalypse. Blight has wiped out much of the planet's food supply. Dust storms ravage the landscape like the Depression-era's Dust Bowl. The only hope is a new home for humanity. Nolan and his brother John take an interesting structure on how to reveal their story to the audience. We are first introduced to Cooper (Mathew McConaughey), a widowed, former pilot and engineer turned farmer, who takes care of his two children Tom (TimothÃ©e Chalamet) and Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and lives with his father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). He has a knack for chasing down surveillance drones and idealistic thoughts of space travel. He is a character that thinks very much outside of the box in terms of earth's future. Rather than being a 'caretaker' for earth, he dreams of exploring new horizons. The Nolan brothers give us almost an hour's time to digest and comprehend all the characters. The film itself feels very much like a family drama with a gentle hint of science fiction. We are later introduced to NASA and learn that there is a program, which hopes to achieve planet relocation for humanity. The catch is for Cooper to partake in a journey that involves a wormhole and a severe space time continuum that may result in him not being able to return home, much less save earth in time.The movie shifts gear to space, where three fellow astronauts and a walking, talking computer with sarcastic tendencies accompany Cooper. They explore new worlds, encounter perilous situations, and discover hidden truths that could ultimately determine the fate of humanity's survival. The last twenty-minutes alone is a masterwork that feels like a contemporary version of Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey.' For a first time viewer, the ending maybe a bit confusing or deep. Several people in the theater with me began uttering phrases like 'What did I just watch?' or 'I don't get it. What happened?' Like Nolan's 'Inception,' this is a film that warrants multiple viewings. This reason may not necessarily be for audiences to help understand the events of the plot better, but rather to find concealed levels of sophistication in this multi-layered film. 'Interstellar' is a movie you can watch once and be entertained. It is also one that can be viewed many times as a method to catch all the little details that Nolan has thrown into his film. Like a good, thought-provoking film, every shot and every bit of dialog is important and has a reason. However, unlike a great intricate movie, there are moments in the plot where elements do not make much sense. Others feel forced and rushed. This may sound odd since it is almost three hours long. There are some moments that deliver as incredibly fast, such as Cooper saying good-bye to his family in one scene and then suddenly appearing in space with three characters that the audience had not been fully introduced. In this way, the movie feels almost like two films in one, the first with his family and the other as an epic space adventure. I can picture what Nolan wanted to achieve with his filmâ€”a sci-fi masterpiece with three-dimensional characters and a unique story. Sometimes it takes a long time to tell a story in its, entirety. 'Interstellar' never feels long. As an audience member, I could care less if this movie was five hours. There were transitions and scenes that needed explaining.The film has many great things going for it. McConaughey turns in a truly believable and outstanding performance as Cooper. We can feel the pain he emanates from missing his family and accept that he is a family man. He moved me in this almost as much as he had in 'Dallas Buyer's Club.' The supporting cast fades in the background compared to McConaughey, but they do all right. Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, and Matt Damon are among the A-list actors in this movie. They all fit their parts. The visual effects, cinematography, and production design set a futuristic setting without it looking too much like a traditional sci-fi movie (ex: Star Wars, Star Trek, Aliens, Blade Runner). Rather the look is kind of gritty and it doesn't feel glossy, sharp, or overly polished. The technical attributes are convincing and look photo-realistic, especially the robot TARS. Never did I feel like I was watching a movie surrounded with green screens. The choice of using some practical effects helps in this regard. The musical composition by Hans Zimmer is hypnotizing. It put me in a trancelike state and mesmerized me beyond words. It's his best work since 'Time' from 'Inception.' 'Interstellar' is overall a very good movie, perhaps even a great one. Yet I would not call it the best movie of 2014, nor would I hoist it up in the likes of other science-fiction movies. There is the issue of the sound mixing that is worth addressing. While I could hear the majority of the dialog, the mixer artists put the sound effects at top priority over the dialog in some instances. Though many people complain about this, it is really not a surprising technique that Nolan has chosen for his film. 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight Rises' had the SFX and music mixed at a higher level than the dialog. This creates a realistic dynamic range. Just think, when you're flying a spaceship that is crashing and you're trying to yell over the malfunctioning controls and engines, your words would not be heard clearly. It is only bad during one pivotal scene where there is no SFX present. Whether by aesthetic, error, or the director's choice, it is very indiscernible and only frustrates the viewer.This is a movie worth seeing in the theaters and I can picture myself seeing it several times. Buying it on Blu-ray though, that's debatable.",9,1,5,2 December 2014
Pacific Rim," Kaijus versus Jaegars...Guillermo Del Toro's big budget dream
","A friend of mine described this feature as being so corny that it is enjoyable. He is not the only one who thinks this. Director and writer Guillermo Del Toro was not trying to accomplish anything inventive or groundbreaking with this movie--like with 'Blade 2' and the 'Hellboys' he was going for pure entertainment. In this arena, 'Pacific Rim' excels. It is jaw-dropping and awe-inspiring to watch on the big screen with deafening surround sound and beautiful visual effects that should steal the golden statue. The plot is simple and basic. Monsters have come to invade from another world and humanity has to defeat them before the planet is obliterated. The monsters are known as Kaiju (Japanese word for monster) and the machines that the humans have built to fight them are called Jaegars (in German means hunter). Combined with a ten minute intro by the main character, which brilliantly sets up the story without being too technical and daunting, followed by a remaining plot that progresses without boredom makes what could have been a dull clichÃ© intriguing. The characters at first glance seem to be the generic types in this type of a movie. A hero who lost his brother to the monsters (Hunnam). A quiet, modest Japanese girl who wants revenge (Kikuchi). An aging badass leader who is the glue that keeps the company going (Idris Elba). A couple of quirky scientists (Day and Gorman). And even a dog and a slimy black market dealer (Perlman). But as the movie charges forward, such common characters are forgivable for all the actors make their performances their own without being overly emotional or wooden. They manage to make the audience laugh and we have the tendency to cheer them on as they kick the Kaijus' asses. All in all, 'Pacific Rim' marks as a great fun movie, even if it is about man machines beating giant reptiles to a pulp with their bare hands. Visually stunning. Meant for the big screen. Go see it before it goes into the DVD and Blu-Ray shelves at Walmart.",8,21,34,1 August 2013
Empire of the Sun," A movie that swept me off my feet from its wonderful film-making, story, and performance by Christian Bale!
","Steven Spielberg always had the power to sweep an audience into a movie's story and wonderful film-making talent. I had just seen 'Empire of the Sun' and I have to say that it is one of his most underrated films. Like Schindler's List, Hook, and E.T., I was captivated by the film's look of an unforgettable time period, seen through the eyes of a young boy.A very young Christian Bale plays a boy, Jamie Graham, who lives with his parents in China during the Second World War. As the Japanese invade, he and his family are forced to leave. However, they get separated and young Jamie is forced to survive on his own. He later befriends a couple of American merchants (John Malkovich and Joe Pantoliano). They later end up in a Japanese internment camp of where Jamie is put to the test to endure the horrors of war and hold onto his imagination and sanity.The plot itself is remarkable, believable and highly emotional. There are many tear-jerking scenes, delivered wonderfully by John Williams moving score and Christian Bale's performance. How Bale didn't get an Oscar nomination is beyond me. The work of costume design, art direction, and cinematography is outstanding, probably making it hard for the Academy Awards to decide whether this or 'The Last Emperor' deserved the Oscars.'The Last Emperor' was the winner of those Awards and more in 1987 (in fact all its 6 nomination were given to The Last Emperor). I could understand that, since The Last Emperor was a biography drama of Emperor Pu Yi. It was a good movie, but not engaging. In addition, John Williams score was a triumph over Ryuichi Sakamoto's, Cong Su's, and David Bryne's score for The Last Emperor. The marvelous work of Michael Kahn's editing, and sound is also better than The Last Emperor's.'Empire of the Sun' is an excellent film that swept me off my feet from its wonderful film-making, story, and performance by Christian Bale, which is all something beyond Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Last Emperor' capability. 10/10",10,0,2,5 July 2008
American Sniper," Cooper's performance is the glue that keeps American Sniper together
","'American Sniper' is a movie that can be very easily interpreted as American propaganda. The use of the word 'American' in the film's title is enough for some to make this claim. The motto 'God, country, and family' rings true to mind in what this film depicts. In actuality though, 'American Sniper' is a feature that takes a patriotic individual, hoists him up as a legend and then brings him back down to the harsh level of a haunted soul. Clint Eastwood is a master director who knows how to show the flawed and imperfect nature of humanity. Just watch 'Unforgiven,' 'Mystic River,' and 'Letters of Iwo Jima.' With US Seal Sniper Chris Kyle, he is portrayed as an unsophisticated character. From youth, we get to see his life grow from a god-fearing hunter who dreams of being a cowboy to the deadliest sniper in American history. In response to 9/11, just like many American men and women, he enlists in the Navy to serve his country. We watch as he endures four tours of active duty in Iraq and tries to readjust in the safe confines of suburban America. Writer Jason Hall molds him as a sympathetic and likable person, whom is determined to eliminate the enemy and protect his home. It is Bradley Cooper's deeply expressive performance that captures the essence of this simple yet larger-than-life person. As an actor, Cooper has acquired a power to display in both voice and face great emotion. Without him even uttering a word, we can comprehend the thoughts going on in his head. His performance is nothing short of deserving an Oscar nomination. Clint Eastwood smartly keeps the camera on him for the majority of the film, allowing the audience to empathize and understand his character. He also gives us a parched, desolate, desert landscape plagued by violence and cruelty. The amount of dedication in the cinematography and production design give viewers a gritty look of Iraq, which rivals Kathryn Bigelow's 'The Hurt Locker.' The war sequences are quite brutal and intense. The final action scene alone is truly marvelous as a sandstorm blankets the battle-stricken Baghdad.'American Sniper' unfortunately falls short on many other aspects, dragging what could have been a great movie down to mediocrity. While the focus is on Kyle, other parts of his life are introduced and then just as quickly dismissed. We get to see his younger brother join up the marines and then we never see him again. Likewise, the relationship between his strict father takes precedent in the first ten-minutes, and yet it goes nowhere afterwards. His war buddies appear, disappear, and then reappear usually for a plot device. As a viewer, we barely get a chance to know them like Kyle. When they are killed off, we really do not feel any emotional engagement or loss. The added subplot of a Middle Eastern sniper targeting US Soldiers feels clichÃ©d and a poor attempt to draw a main antagonist for the lead character. Even the relationship between Kyle and his wife is limited in time. We are left with following a great American patriot consumed with torment. The frequent jumps between war and home grows old very quickly. An entire movie could have been just based upon one of Kyle's tours and it would feel like a more completed film. In short, this movie left me wanting more than the 132-minutes had to offer. That is the sad problem with most biographical films. They are spread so thin that they actually show too little in too much time. I'm probably in the minority on this one, but 'American Sniper' is a slightly above average film, and that is mainly because of Bradley Cooper's performance. I wanted to love this, but I cannot. Regardless, I still appreciate the people who brought Chris Kyle's story back to life.",6,9,34,10 January 2015
Glory," The Greatest Civil War movie!
","I'm a person who doesn't get impressed easily with most movies, particularly with war films. But after seeing this film, I was left paralyzed with awe. I had never seen such a powerfully driven war film that comes close to as grand as this (save for Braveheart). Based upon the inspiring true story of the 54th Massachusettes, of 600 colored men whom are hired as Union soldiers to fight in the war that divided the American nation, the film had everything darn near perfect.The film had a powerhouse of performances: Mathew Broderick, Denzel Washington, and Morgan Freeman. People rip on Broderick for being sleazy as the 21 year-old Gould Shaw, but I differ, for he gave a preference that was so moving, that it makes me nearly cry that he did not get at least an Oscar nomination.Denzel Washington by far gave the best performance as the conflicted, young, runaway slave, Private Trip, whom is driven by rage, sarcasm, and pride. Every single shot of him on camera shines with these bursting personalities and also revealing a hidden character of courage and honor who seeks dignity and respect (representing the true spirit of the 54th Massachusettes). The Oscar he won was truly worthy, and never have i seen such a grand performance as his in years.Lastly, Morgan Freeman, once again proves to be one of the best actors alive. He plays the quiet, but compassionate Rawlins, who earns the rank of Sergeant Major in the regiment. With his persuasive voice and words of wisdom and comfort, he holds the entire regiment together from breaking apart, as he demonstrates in a confrontation, later in the film, with Trip, saying 'We need to getty up and kick in like men!' Freeman was simply amazing! The rest of the cast, including Cary Elwes, Andre Braugher, and Jihmi Kennedy was also highly believable and stellar in their performances.The music score by James Horner was gripping, and should also have gotten at least an Oscar nom for. The cinematography was beautiful, the set-decoration was authentic, and the sound and sound mixing in the battle sequences were realistic. But on a downside note, the battle scenes lacked the ferocity and intensity as Bravehart held; the violence was no different than Gettysburg, for it looked more like an reenactment rather than actual war. The staging and some of the choreography was a bit hokey. Nonethless, it had some graphic moments to it, that pushed for a meager R rating. Even though it lacked the brutality of war, the battles were still intense and emotionally moving, which was aided by James Horner's magnificent score. And another note to add, throughout the film there are many laughable mistakes from historical errors to 'sight gags'. Other than a couple of these flaws, the film gave a strong, solid soul. Glory remains and always will be on my top ten favorite lists of movies, as well as the greatest civil war film ever. It is film that defies prejudice and oppression and shows that no matter what race you are or the color of skin you have, you are a living person.**** out of ****",10,1,2,7 February 2007
American Hustle," Best of 2013
","According to the trivia section of the IMDb Page for 'American Hustle,' it states that director David O. Russell said to Christian Bale, 'I hate plots. I am all about characters, that's it.' Whether this is a true fact or not is debatable. In viewing this movie, however, this trivia statement seems thoroughly factual to Mr. Russell's intent with his new feature. There are five characters present and each of them have one common trait...they lie. With the backdrop of the 1970s, two con artists, Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) and Sydney Posser (Amy Adams) work with an FBI agent (Bradley Cooper) to take down a corrupted politician (Jeremy Renner). The sting could all fall apart from Irving's unpredictable wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). The plot is simple enough. Any half-decent writer could come up with this idea. But what sells its excellence is the characters. These individuals are not necessary persons you would want to meet or perhaps even feel sympathy for. Yet, they are so sophisticated and intriguing to watch on the big screen as they lie, seduce, and back-stab one another. In a way, it is the ultimate soap opera feature. The ensemble cast is nothing short from what I expect from a David O. Russell film. He molds them to deliver the best of their ability and then some. Bale once again physically and mentally transforms himself as Irving Rosenfeld. Sleazy, crooked, yet compassionate and nice--all that is needed in humanizing a con man, and Bale does so with finesse. Amy Adams as his partner is equally brilliant. She portrays her character with seductive ingenuity, and cunning wittiness--a real manipulator and con artist. She is truly an underrated actress who desperately needs accolade recognition.In comparison, Cooper and Lawrence play their roles with more fun than seriousness. Cooper is determined and over the top as the ambitious FBI agent Richie DiMaso. He practically lights up the screen with his wild energy and off-handed sense of humor. Jennifer Lawrence is a real screen stealer in her small part. It is more than apparent that she watched 'The Real Housewives of New Jersey' via her thick Jersey accent and snobby attitude. Yet she pulls in elements of a woman who is a force of nature like in the old 1930s screwball comedies. I see a bit of Katherine Hepburn from 'Bringing Up Baby' in her depiction Rosalyn. She could very well earn a second consecutive Oscar and I will not complain. Jeremy Renner is unfortunately dwarfed by his acting counterparts. He still makes a good character as the politician who is on a path of building greatness to his city.The bigger budget to this film has improved the visual style of David O Russell's new film. Hand-held camera work is replaced with smooth steadi-cam and dolly shots, creating a believable period piece of the 1970s. The sets, props, costumes, hairstyles, even choice of music redevelops this lost era of fun and disco. Some of the techniques of editing and voice-over narrative are a bit of a knockoff from a Scorsese film. For instance, a freeze frame is used on a character as another character explains who the significance of this person to the audience. This really isn't terrible, but it feels too much like 'Goodfellas' when this movie is supposed to be a David O. Russell creation. Aside from this minor critique, 'American Hustle' is a great character-driven film with little action and phenomenal dialog. I will go so far as to call this the best movie I have seen this year. My rating: 10/10",10,5,11,30 December 2013
The Bourne Ultimatum," A nice wrap-up for the Bourne Trilogy
","Like many other people that I know, I really enjoyed 'The Bourne Identity'. When I went and saw 'The Bourne Supremacy' three years ago, I was disappointed due to the out of control shaky camera and the death of Franka Potente's character. So my feelings for a third movie of The Bourne trilogy were not so high. Now that I've finally saw 'The Bourne Ultimatum', it was a pretty good comeback and a nice wrap-up of the trilogy.The film directly picks up off of the events of the last one in Moscow. Bourne (Oscar winner Matt Damon) escapes with his life and begins the crusade of finding his past identity as he deals with some violent flashbacks which could be key as to locating who he really is. The movie really jumps around from a lot of different locations around the world for the first half hour, which really left me confused for a bit.But after this setback, the story picks up and Bourne once again has to dodge deadly assassins and a ruthless CIA director (Oscar nominee David Strathain) whose sole purpose is to make sure Bourne dies. Meanwhile Pamela Landy (Oscar nominee Joan Allen) soon uncovers the truth of an operation called Blackbriar and becomes Bourne's ally.I was impressed with this film. It had great suspense, amazing car chases, and plenty of stylish hand-to-hand combat, particularly on Damon's part. The direction by Paul Greengrass, (who directed the previous Bourne), really captures the story as well as the nonstop action. The camera is still hand held like most of his movies but it wasn't out of control to the point that needed some anti-nausea pills.All the knots are tied in the end, leaving a good close for the trilogy. If you're a Bourne fan, this is the one you should definitely see. To be honest though, I didn't like this one as much as the first since the original is always the hardest one to beat, but I still liked this one nonetheless. 8/10",8,4,6,8 October 2007
Rush," Character drama+F1 racing=A Very Good Movie
","Ron Howard's movies can be a hit or miss. They are either really good or not very memorable. Nonetheless, he is a director that will try anything. That reason alone makes him very versatile. Each of his movies looks and feels different than the other. His new film Rush is set during the 1970sâ€”about the Formula One racers. Its center focus is the rivalry between Englishman James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Austrian Nicki Lauda (Daniel BrÃ¼hl). What could have been a bland sports action flick is an interesting and thorough character study of two men after glory. Both share the same goal of winning the championship yet they are both polar opposites on their outlooks in the game.James Hunt is depicted as a charismatic playboy type. He sleeps around with women, drinks, parties, and lives purely for the moment. Lauda on the other hand is an individual who sets himself to be the best. He takes his driving so seriously that he spends all nighters perfecting his race car, not even bothering to associate with his fellow acquaintances. One cannot help but wonder if he is an 'a--hole' as most characters call him, or if he is just treating racing as an occupation. Hunt displays a persona that is easy to like and admireâ€”he is a bit of a showman and likes to have fun. Lauda is the opposite. He could care less about his looks or images and he is hardly ever seen elated. Seeing these two completely different personalities marks great character drama that gives the audience a purpose to watch the filmâ€”unlike Days of Thunder, which was only fun because of the races and crash sequences. While the movie is well written by the great Peter Morgan, the soul rests on Hemsworth's and BrÃ¼hl's performances. Hemsworth scores his best work as James Hunt. It is nice to see him break away from being Thor and doing something that requires a bit more depth. Perhaps this can be a shift away from the superhero schtik. Spanish actor Daniel BrÃ¼hl had more of a challenge to develop with his character. One of which is the fact that he had to portray an Austrian racer. Though bilingual, his Austrian accent feels fake and overdone. That does not necessarily mean he is terrible. Acting wise, he is very good. He truly shines following the crash that almost leaves his character dead. He marvelously pulls off a touching scene in which he tries to fit a helmet over his head, but he can't due to the pain. Both the physical and emotional agony he endears of fearing he may never be able to drive again is borderline heart wrenching to watch. Many people are talking Oscar buzz for him and he might very well earn a nomination. The other factor that cannot be overlooked is the technical marvels that Ron Howard and his crew put togetherâ€”the fact that cameras were mounted on real F1's going 180 miles per hour is incredible. The type of camera angles and techniques are fascinating. We get to visually experience what it is like to be on a fast ride. As director of photography, Anthony Dod Mantle truly went all out on this picture. The sound design is equally top-notched, some of the best I have ever heard in a movie theater. The editing is crisp, appropriately building the plot's tension. The visual effects are sparse but effective during the crash sequences. Hans Zimmer's score is low-key for the drama and adrenaline pumping for the racesâ€”a fitting mix. Most of all, the make up and prosthetics used for Daniel BrÃ¼hl in the second half of the movie is shocking and realistic. The real Nicki Lauda saw this movie on its premiere in Europe and he even said after his viewing of the recreation of the crash sequence and his subsequent injuries was an authentic and intense experience for him. Rush is more than above the average sports flick and it is not watered down to the PG-13 rating. Aside from swear words and graphic race car-related injuries, the sexual appetite and drug/alcohol abuse by James Hunt is a strong force in the movie. Such things can happen to men in a dangerous occupation like F1 racingâ€”they often choose to live a wild lifestyle. As Hunt says in the movie, 'The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live.' Do not be discouraged by the rating. Rush is a very good movie. 8/10",8,2,3,6 October 2013
Burn After Reading," Another great dark comedy by the Coen Brothers.
","The Coen Brothers make very unusual, yet good movies. 'Burn After Reading' is a definite exception of their work. They capture the quirky yet likable characters fluently and deliver a pretty witty script. For such a big ensemble cast, I was well-pleased by each of the actors performances. But I think the real geniuses are Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, J.K. Simmons and Brad Pitt. Especially Pitt. He had to have had a blast making this movie. He is so irresistibly funny, making it hard at times for me to breath. Frances McDormand has excellent chemistry with Pitt, and also with the other actors she gets involved with. As with John Malkovich, he's his own character. His fits of anger get so intense that it is hard not to laugh at. J.K. Simmons, although only in the film for five minutes, delivers clever lines one after another that make me want to fall out of my chair with laughter. 'Burn After Reading' is a strange, yet brilliant dark comedy that any fan of the Coen Brothers should see. But be warned, like some of their other work, there's a fair amount of swearing and sometimes gross sexual humor.",8,4,9,14 September 2008
Watchmen," Visual Splendor+Plot=Success!
","I had never read the graphic novel by Alan Moore so I did not know what to expect. It piqued my interest, particularly being directed by Zack Snyder. I knew this movie was going to be a feast for the eyes. Yes, this film has a lot of excellent visual effects, probably the best I've seen since 'Transformers', but the grand CGI does not make this movie, but the plot. I enjoyed '300' for the visual splendor, but it lacked a great plot. 'Watchmen' makes up for it. Since the graphic novel was written in the 1980s, the story revolves around the Cold War. It almost makes the statement, what would have happened if we had superheroes on our side? How would the world be? Rather, how would the Cold War turn out? For one, it takes a historical event like the Vietnam War and combines it with the advantage of the superheroes (primarily Dr. Manhattan, who helps the U.S. take over Vietnam in a week with his super powers). Despite the fact that there are superheroes on the American side, the film depicts the nation as a dystopia, the masses are driven by violence, and the politicians are corrupt and power- hungry (I personally love how the movie portrays Nixon-who has been in office for 5 terms) who use the superheroes to their advantage, such as muscle work on the rioting population and the production of weapons of mass destruction to use against the Soviets. But when one of the superheroes is brutally murdered, hell breaks lose and the heroes wonder who is targeting them while trying to maintain some form of stability in the world. Without giving too much more of the plot away, the movie almost holds an anti-war message. It is understandable that this wasn't released some 20 years ago (for one the visual effects issue), but also the fact that it depicts the world what it was back in such a time, as well as what it could have led up to. This film could also be considered a satire on the Cold War, the fact that it exaggerates certain things, specifically the depictions of the politicians.As with the cast members, all of them added diligence to their roles. Even though Billy Crudup was probably in a green suit for the majority of the movie as Dr. Manhattan, he delivers his lines fluently. But the real genius in acting is Jackie Earle Haley. I cannot recall in seeing him in any other film, but he makes himself into the mysterious character Rorschach. If I were the academy, I would definitely consider him for a nomination in the actor in supporting role. His acting though isn't the only driving force about his character, but how the director portrays him. By his clothing, with the hat and heavy coat, Rorschach is a pure superhero image of the incorruptible film noir detective. The use of the deep shadows and unique camera angles (as well as Haley's voice-over narration) adds more to the film noir genre. The only thing missing is the dramatic music. Snyder also squeezes in other genres and their elements into the particular characters in the film such as science-fiction for Dr. Manhattan, romance with Silk Spectre II, and drama with Nite Owl II. Each character also has their own unique story, which add layers to themselves as well as how they play their part in the plot, leading to the big finale. The other works such as: photography, editing, sound design, costume and set decoration were all well-crafted and taken into considerable care to make such a unique film. These talents are perfectly shown during the opening titles, in which there is little dialog, shown through visuals that illustrate the events that happened from the 1940s to the 1980s, including: archive footage of the Vietnam War, and a reenactment of the J.F.K assassination. There is so much told in this opening that it is both incredible by its visual splendor but also of reminding us what had happened in the twentieth century. There was one thing though that I did not anticipate in this movie, and that was its depiction of violence. It does say rated R for 'strong graphic violence' but I only shrugged thinking that it'll be stylized and unrealistic like in '300'. Yes, some of it is very cartoonish and even at times comical and over exaggerated, but also much of it is quite disturbing such as: a graphic rape scene, beatings and killings of innocent people (including a pregnant woman- though off screen) and other forms of brutality. Such material may have been in the comic book or thrown in for shock value, but in either case, it seemed random to me, and did not benefit to the story. If anything, it seemed to distract from it. I am not a squeamish person, but some of the stuff in this film bothered me. 'Watchmen' is a great movie, and I would see it again, but it's not for kids nor is it for those who can't handle violence. Because of this, I give this movie a solid 9/10.",9,1,4,24 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The greatest fantasy tale brought to life!
","I've read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and absolutely love them. I never thought that such a fantasy could be brought to life on cinema, for it is such a challenge to film a movie off of one book (three in all) that has so much story, exotic locations, epic battle sequences on grand scales, and most importantly, strong character development.For those of you who don't know of Lord of the Rings, it is a simple tale of good vs. evil of a dark lord named Sauron, who has lost his powerful ring, which falls into the hands of a hobbit, Frodo (a creature that is small, cute, and furry feet), played by Elijah Wood, who gives a very powerful performance as the confused and determined hobbit, who sets out on a quest to destroy the evil ring and bring peace into the world. He is guided by a wise wizard played by Sir Ian McKellan who is a pure image of Gandalf (just like in the books).Peter Jackson, a well known, New Zealand director, not only captures the story, but brings to life. it is simply amazing. I have not seen such a beautiful and awestruck film ever for a very long time. The director brings the world to life with amazing production design, costumes, and visual effects that triumph over all other films to date. He also includes some awesome camera angels, which brings you, the audience closer to this magical world.The cinematography used was so astonishing, that it gave an intense feeling of emotion, that was incredible, reminded me very much of Braveheart, particularly with the fight sequences that were intense and highly action oriented, but it still holds a hint of blood and gore to it, but minimized it to a PG-13 rating. The score also gave this emotional feeling, especially with the characters that helps describe their moods which is: sorrow, courage, power, and above all engaging.it is an amazing, rare feat of movie-making that I have not seen in a long time. The film is: inspiring, enchanting, breath-taking, and captivating. Peter Jackson, as well as the rest of the crew has turned an ordinary fantasy tale into a unique film.Rating **** out of ****",10,0,0,17 December 2006
Man of Steel," Man of Steel delivers from the black hole that Superman has vanished into
","Let's face it folks, there has not been a great Superman movie since Christopher Reeves soared the screens in 1978. With a new reboot of the Man of Steel, we can anticipate it as either being very good or really bad. The big critics seem to agree with such a notion. They either liked it or hated it. There is no middle ground. For me, the revived super hero film is something to admire again with a fresh slate. Many of the strengths of this new Superman is its imaginative creativity on how it focuses on both the hero's struggles and his origin. The opening sequence of Krypton is simply a stunning visual feast that puts the compacted ice cave from the past Superman films to shame. Here, Zack Snyder and the VFX team has given us a world with spaceships, monsters, people, battles, and ultimately life and destruction. In other words, the beginning sets the tone in plot and action, like any good superhero flick should. The rest of the film is dedicated to how the protagonist learns of his past and how he evolves from an outcast with special abilities to something more. While this sounds familiar, writer David S. Goyer gives us more back story, filling factors that were never really explored in other movies of the franchise. One such example is rather than jumping ahead with the famed Lex Luthor villain, this movie's plot introduces an antagonist that has seemed to slip into oblivion...General Zod from the home world of Krypton. Like with the League of Shadows for Batman, this establishes the hero's first and most important villain that has come to haunt him...a blast from the past so to speak. Zack Snyder as director has an eye for stunning visual effects and knowing how to form a wide scope of imagination (just watch 300 and Watchmen). He also knows how to create action sequences worth remembering. Believe me, they are abundant in this movie, but they are not overbearing like in a Michael Bay film. There is a reason to them for the plot. The one thing that I seem to enjoy about the most of this movie is Hans Zimmer's musical composition. While it is unfair to say that it is better than what John Williams did in 1978, he makes something memorable and uplifting. Though doubtful, it would be appropriate for him to receive some accolades for it. The cast in this movie is full of big names and stars. They range from the popular Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, and Amy Adams to the small players like Christopher Meloni, Michael Shannon, and Laurence Fishburne. Each appear to fit their parts well, but some are greater than others. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane turn in some subtle and believable performances as Superman's human parents. Whereas Russell Crowe seems to be playing Maximus from Gladiator more or less as Jor-el and Michael Shannon as General Zod has the overgrowing tendency of swelling up with anger like a child who's toy has been taken from him. Amy Adams is a little older than what I imagine for Lois Lane, but she is still lovely and plausible. Henry Cavill as Superman is the man who carries the film. He is gentle in his role and plays the outcast side of the Man of Steel well. As a superhero, he appears a bit emotionless. Then again, Superman was not known for showing much emotion.Though I kind of have mixed feelings about the casts' performances, I am bothered the most by the style of storytelling. In comparison to the linear story method used in the 1978 film, this movie jumps around from different scenes in the first hour that seem not to relate or make sense. The accompanied flashbacks thrown in of Superman's childhood on earth makes it even more perplexing. Fortunately, the second half of the film makes up for the confusion that the first act and a half make. All things considering, 'Man of Steel' has started a potentially promising new restart for Superman.",9,2,4,23 June 2013
Knowing," Interesting and great...until the end
","I read Ebert's review on this movie, and he gave it four stars. He doesn't hand out four stars easily and neither do I, so I sat down and watched this movie to see how good it really is. For starters, I'll say that 'Knowing' is not the typical science fiction film with big explosions and overwhelming CGI like much of this summer's blockbusters. It is a movie that draws a fine question: Is there a purpose to life or do things just randomly happen?The performances are rock solid. Nicholas Cage takes on many odd roles and once again he proves himself to be very versatile as the depressed John Koesteller who's left alone with his estranged son Caleb (Chandler Canterbary), who starts having visions of the end of the world. A fifty-year mystery is unraveled at Caleb's school as he finds a piece of paper that has coded writings, which predict events that have happened in the past and in the incoming future. I won't go too much further with the film's plot, because (a) it would ruin the film for those of you who haven't seen it and (b) it would take a book to try and explain it; Knowing is one of those film's that you have to see from start to finish to get the gist of. For the whole two hours, I was interested and wanted more when it ended.The cinematography is beautiful, the editing is crisp, and Marco Beltrami's score adds depth of mystery, suspense, and beauty to the film. I'll also note that the visual effects are not overdone or overused. They look and feel real. But when I mention that I wanted more when the film ended, I wanted more plot and answers. Now I hate to give too much of the ending away, but I have to say that I was very disappointed in it. In the last twenty minutes of the film, it felt that the screenwriters did not know what to go for in a good resolution as well as a point to the film. Was it a look at fate? Selflessly acting to save lives when gifted with special knowledge? Or finding faith, better late than never? And since aliens were involved, who enabled a young girl to predict the next fifty years of disasters, yet stood idly by while such prophecies was wasted in a time capsule, providing no one with such knowledge? No one except one man, far too late to change anything at all, who would merely 'know' that the end was too soon? What good was there in his knowing?If the screenwriters had chosen a route regarding God and faith, it might have made sense. If they had stuck with a sci-fi view, with aliens, it might approach something like 'The Day The Earth Stood Still', and made some sense. If they had merely wanted a commentary on fate, destiny, or another one of those 'the universe holds many mysteries' interpretation, they could have worked with that too. Instead the resolution is meaningless disaster.My point being is that the screenwriters could have worked something more interesting for an ending and a message. The movie was a great film, until the very end. Things are left unanswered, up to the audience to decide what the message is. I guess this works on some viewers, but in my opinion, when a filmmaker makes a sci-fi film, all knots need to be tied and there should be a point, even if it is as ridiculous as a Paul Verhoven film. My rating: ***/****",8,1,3,27 December 2009
Hugo," Movies are our special place...
","Martin Scorsese doing a family movie? Really? After a spew of some of the most violent gangster movies ever made, one could possibly think that Scorsese has gone daffy for taking such a vast turn in another film genre. I eventually overcame this bafflement and went to see 'Hugo' this morning. Having the entire theater to myself, I found myself having an ultimate experience in movie magic.I had the assumption that this movie is about an orphan named Hugo (Asa Butterfield) who wanders endlessly in a train station and finds something magical about it. I'm only partially correct, there is an orphan and he lives in a train station, but there is no actual magic per se in this movie. Rather the focus is on the orphan's late father (Jude Law) and a toyshop owner (Ben Kingsley). Somehow there is a connection between the two. All the while he meets some friends and desperately avoids a dimwitted, yet cruel train station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen). The plot in it of itself is relatively simple, but the level mystery that Hugo uncovers about the toyshop owner keeps the film interesting. The movie does not fly by; it feels like a two-hour movie. Yet not one single minute is dull.The cast is very good, especially Sacha Baron Cohen. I can't help but compare him to the child catcher in 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.' He's well groomed, has a whip, and even has a vicious dog. All he needed was a net to catch children in. Ben Kingsley at first comes off as a grumbling, cranky old man, but as the story progresses, he becomes a thoroughly likable character. I am also very pleased that Christopher Lee plays a significant part in this film. The actor is going on 90 years old and he is still in moviesâ€”simply outstanding! The child actors though are what keep the movie together. Asa Butterfield does not have many lines, but he delivers them with the appropriate emotion with each scene. Much of his acting talent comes from his facial expressions, for he is able to portray sorrow and despair very well. Chloe Grace Moretz outshines Asa though as the more outgoing and steadfast Isabelle. What I enjoy most about this movie is the production quality that the filmmakers put into it. The set and costume designs are some of, if not the best I have ever seen in a movie (leave it to the imaginative geniuses of Dante Ferretti and Sandy Powell). They certainly help shape the film's time period. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is stunning and Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is flawless. Howard Shore's mystical score adds another dimension to the film. It's nice that he created an entirely different sound for 'Hugo' and did plagiarize off of himself, unlike some more prominent film composers. I imagine this must have been hard for Shore to pull off, after doing such inspiring work for 'The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.' 'Hugo' is a well-crafted, well-acted, enjoyable movie that is both humorous and sad, and it pays a wonderful homage to the silent film era. As Hugo says in the feature, 'Movies are our special place.'",10,3,6,17 December 2011
The Shining," The Shining Shines with Terror!
","I'm a person who usually does not get frightened by movies easily. However, when seeing this, as an adult, I have to say this was the first movie that really frightened me since seeing the original Alien when i was a child! It sent shivers down my spine, and makes my heart rate pound like an athlete in a marathon. This film does not scare in the typical horror fashion of blood and gore and unrealistically CGI effects like most modern-day films.Yes, there is bloody violence, but instead of being about aliens running around in spaceships or a lethal epidemic spreading through the world, the film is psychologically disturbing on the standpoint that the mere thought of a devoting, subtle husband (played by the ultimate Jack Nichlson) who turns into a disillusioned crazed man that seeks to savagely murder his wife (Shelley Duvall) and his telepathic son (Danny Lloyd) is much more intense and realistic. In other words, the film was not designed to only give nightmares for children, but also to adults. Based off of Stephen King's bestselling novel, the film was excellent. It captured and brought to life the terror and horror of insanity and isolation.Stanley Kubrick brilliantly brought this film to life with both captivating up close shots and distant camera angles. The variety and creativity of the use of camera angles makes the film feel real. In other words, the viewer would feel inside the film, rather than a member of the audience. From the aerial shot of the car traveling in the beginning to the suspenseful, climatic chase in the maze, they were all gripping and thrilling. It was also supported by the dreamy setting of the massive, but creepy hotel, and the pumping classical music, along with the 'wierd 80's style of music' (that gives me premonitions to Blade Runner), it all added to the suspense and thrills in the film.This movie also holds one of Jack Nicholson's finest performances. He delivers not only one of the most memorable scenes in movie history, but also one of the best lines ever. He shouts, 'Heeeere's Johnny!' as he hacks his way through the bathroom door with an ax to maim his wife. this is one of many captivating scenes. He was both coldly humorous and very chilling as Jack Torrence. Every single scene of him was simply fantastic! Shelley Duvall was also very good in role as the pampered, delirious wife; as was Scatsman Crother as the cook who is a bit limited in the film, but is great nonetheless. The other great performance was by Danny Lloyd. He also gave a very compelling performance as the sensitive son who sees haunting images and croaks the word 'redrum', and writes it in lipstick near the finale, only to spell the word 'murder' backwards. This is another scene that even thinking about it now gives shivers down my spine. I was never a fan of Kubrick, nor of the horror genre, but The Shining, by far is the father of all horror films. Any horror film ever made needs to be measured in comparison to The Shining, which shines wither absolute terror! **** out of ****",10,1,2,24 March 2007
The Alamo," The three D's. Dry, disappointing, and drawling.
","This film was a total bomb! No history war fan should see this film. It is so bad. I even told my history teacher not to take the challenge kids as a field trip to see The Alamo. When I mean the film was dry, I mean, there wasn't much to it. There was only one mini skirmish and nightly cannon bombardments throughout the film till the end. there just wasn't much to this supposedly fantastic film. throughout the film I had to use my watch to see how much was left of this film. My dad was thinking also when this film was going to end. I was eager to escape the theater. When I mean it was a disappointing, the action level was low. There were only two battles at the end. the casting did a descent job though, which was probably the only reason why I didn't depart the theater, and to see the finale. When I mean the film was drawling, I mean it went on and on for ages. Nothing was to the film! i should e-mail the director and tell him he had made the worst war film in movie history. I was surprised Another probably with the film was that the violence was so intense for a PG-13. It should have been rated R. I give this film a 3 out 0f 10 because of the casts' performance for a lame film, the effects, and the battle sequences. I wrote this comment of The Alamo.",3,1,7,17 April 2004
Wanted," Unrealistic, bloody yet it's worth the money
","This marks the fourth movie I have seen that stars James McAvoy. Like the other three movies, I enjoyed his performance. He plays Wesley Gibson, an average day American who has a job he hates and a girlfriend who doesn't respect him. One night, as he walks into a store, a mysterious called Fox (Angelina Jolie) walks up to him and tells him that his father was an assassin who was killed on top of the metropolitan building. She then saves his life from a ruthless assassin and introduces him to a secret organization called The Fraternity, led by Sloan (Morgan Freeman).There he learns about his true past and follows his father's footsteps as being a trained killer. However, things are never as they seem. 'Wanted' is an action flick with an R rating. Nothing much more. There's plenty of blood and gore in it, many times in slow motion, showing the bullets tear through people and making unpleasant exit wounds. Much of the time I felt like I was watching the present-day version of 300. This made the action at times boring.In addition, many of the action sequences are stylized with unrealistic circumstances. For instance the first action sequence, it has a man jump through a window, pull out again, and shoot the bad guys on the building across from him, never missing a hit, then reaching the other building (which is probably a block away from the one he jumped out of) without an injury from the glass that would have torn him to shreds. Uh? The other thing I found almost comical was the idea of the assassins curving bullets. Okay, you just fling your gun, pull the trigger, and pray to god that you hit your target? Come on. In some instances, when two guys do this, and fire their weapons simultaneously, their bullets collide. Another impossibility. Maybe I just like the Bourne Ultimatum too much or I like The Matrix so much that anyone else copying off of the Wachowski brothers' ideas makes me laugh.There isn't a whole lot of dialog said in the movie, save for James McAvoy who also narrates the movie, adding some offbeat humor to the film. Morgan Freeman wasn't too bad in his role, and Angelina Jolie was a sexy killer that wasn't fearful of showing her butt. I like that. I liked the action sequences even though they're extremely impossible to do. It was a good for the seven dollars, which it cost me, but I won't give it anything else. 7/10",7,1,3,24 July 2008
Salt," The female version Jason Bourne, but lacks plot
","The trailers built this movie up as the female version of Jason Bourne. After seeing it, 'Salt' is the female Jason Bourne. She kills armies of bad guys, knows martial arts, and is even capable of jumping from one tractor-trailer to another on an interstate. Like Matt Damon as Bourne, Jolie makes her own character as Salt. However, this film lacks a solid, structured story, and even some character motivation.One minute Salt is a loyal CIA agent. The next, the CIA turns on her as a Russian in an interrogation room tells the agents Salt is a Russian spy. Really? Believe the Russian in the interrogation room over a loyal agent? And guess what, she is a spy. Later on she fulfills killing her target and then she turns on her own comrade-in-arms and saves the world for destruction. Uh? I'm confused. It seems that the screenwriters can't make up their minds. Liev Schreiber being a villain is also obviousâ€”it has come to the point of being a clichÃ©. Despite all of the mindlessness in plot and Salt's sudden twist of loyalty, betrayal, and loyalty, the movie wasn't too terrible. Why? The pointless action was enough to satisfy me. My rating: 2.5/4If there's going to be a sequel, it should be titled 'Pepper.'",6,2,4,1 March 2011
The Patriot," Great in the first hour, but a swift change afterwords
","I saw this in theaters, and remember it very well. I have heard all the criticisms aimed at this movie, and I somewhat agree. This is a good film, but not great.The film takes place in 1776, the start of the Revolutionary War. Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) is a patriot who fought in the French and Indian war, and is haunted by it. He does his best to raise his seven children, and owns a farm with some slaves. He decides to remain neutral and already foresees the disaster to come in the war, but he never expected it to come his way.Two years into the war, a British army ends up on his front porch, and through his own eyes witnesses the horror of it, and the brutality of it, led by a vicious Colonel (Jason Isaccs). Because of his share of tragedy in the war, he joins the war effort with his eldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger), and Harry Burlum (Chris Cooper), and has his French assistant played by Tckey Karyo, releasing his ultimate fury, which can only be done by Gibson.Everything is great, until after here. The film changes from brutal vendetta, to sudden coolness by Gibson and rather ridiculousness with the formation of the militia, bringing in new characters,and a whole new story of fighting for freedom, versus vigilantes. In fact, the film doesn't become an R again until the end of the film, with the climatic battle.So, the film jumps to a sudden change, which leaves me disappointed, but the cinematography is truly beautiful and an artwork, which follows Gibson through the film, showing his darker side. The scenery is lovely and very authentic, and the score makes the pace go by fast, only delivered by the legendary John Williams. The battles are well choreographed, showing a fair amount of blood and maimed bodies, and a few very disturbing images (keep the children out).I recommend this film not to history buffs, because there is no real accuracy to it, save for its brutality and that there were gatherings of militia that helped turn the tide of the war, but mainly to popcorn lovers. This is a good popcorn loving film, and I was entertained. It was good, but not grand like Gladiator or Braveheart. it does have an emotional impact in it, unlike most modern-day epics, but the great stuff in the film is in the first hour. don't be too disappointed by it.",8,5,7,27 February 2006
Van Helsing," Special effects versus storyline...uhm?
","No doubt Stephen Sommers knows his special effects for his films. Usually, his stories don't seem to have a descent storyline. i honestly think The Mummy returns was a lame film, but i respect the effects, the cast, enjoy the action/humor. This film is not a disaster though as some or many may saw. It is three times better than The Alamo, which i rank on the top ten list of worst films of all time. here's the psitives and negatives. Positives: The visual effects the action sequences The idea of a story The actor Hugh Jackman the villain was a well actor too the grunt creatures, very cute the actor who played the goofy side-kick Negatives: the female vampires behavior (totally stupid) Some of the creatures (Frankenstein, total retard) The length of the movie The ending (hated it!)i still give this film a 7 out of 10. Watch out for pouncing werewolves, running grunts, and screeching vampires!",8,0,1,27 May 2004
Monsters vs. Aliens," Saw it in 3-D, I enjoyed it!
","This has been the first 3-D movie I have seen in the last 15 years. Despite the cost being 11 dollars, I thoroughly enjoyed the film, specifically when everything seems to be coming at you, but what made this animated movie a success is not necessarily the 3-D animation nor the plot (which isn't that great), but the cast, particularly on Seth Rogen's part as B.O.B., the mindless blue matter who has the attention span of a goldfish. Hugh Laurie is excellent as Dr. Cockroach. I'm so used to seeing him in 'House' that I thought he could not pull off any other role, but he does in this. In fact, he changes his voice which is so different from 'House', that he is almost like a totally different person. Rainn Wilson as Gallaxar also delivers his line brilliantly, as a power crazy alien whose intent is to take over the world. Reese Witherspoon, Keifer Sutherland, Will Arnet, and Stephen Colbert deliver great voice acting to their characters as well. In addition to a brilliant cast, the film contains plenty of satire and parody against the government that most of the time I felt like I was going to fall out of my chair laughing. Overall, 'Monsters vs. Aliens' is a great film that is not aimed at a specific audience like many of the other animated films out there are, but to the general public. There is some irreverent humor, but it isn't over the top. When it comes out on DVD, you better check it out. My rating: *** out of ****",8,0,0,3 June 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Purely mature and well executed; it draws our attention to its craft, characters, and story
","'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is based off of the international bestseller of the same title, as well as the Swedish movie that was released in 2009. I have not read the book nor seen the Swedish film, so I did not know what to expect. Even so, I am drawn to this movie because of the name David Fincherâ€”the master of mysterious thrillers who brought us 'Seven' and 'Fight Club.' As a film, Fincher's 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is not so much focused on edge of your seat suspense or thrills, but rather two individuals who lead very different lives that end up paired together and entangled in a murderous case that involves a wealthy family. Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist that is facing a lawsuit over publishing a libelous article. He is hired by a wealthy land baron (Christopher Plummer) to solve the 40 year-old disappearance of his niece Henrietta. He is teamed up with Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), an antisocial Goth computer hacker that is a ward to the state. This all sounds like the makings of a great movie, but not enough to make a 158 minute feature.The first hour of the film is mostly spent on developing the characters Mikael and Lisbeth. Mikael is presented as not a very nice guy. He has an affair with his publicist. His personality is that of sarcasm and skepticism; he is surrounded by a world full of corruption, yet he can't outdo it. He only takes the land baron's job because he needs the money. Nevertheless, Daniel Craig's performance carries a solid, defiant confidence that can be seen in his past work as Agent 007. He never gives up and gets the job done at any means necessary (even at the expense of breaking and entering).Lisbeth is not a perfect individual either. Unlike Mikael though, she is someone to both admire and pity. From the very start of the film, she is depicted as a person who is trying to survive on her own. Her apartment is small, unkempt, and she eats anything she can get her hands on (this includes Happy Meals). Little is known of her past, but what is shown in the film is a young woman that is engulfed by loneliness and sexual abuse. Her short temper and cold, blank stares are not a means to depict her as evil. Rather, they show her as a sympathetic, tormented soul that seeks to be loved. Rooney Mara performs this character flawlessly. Every second I saw her, I cannot help but feel her pain and I felt helpless that there was nothing I can do about it. Simultaneously, I applauded her for the brave actions she delivers in the second half of the film. Her Oscar nomination is well deserved.David Fincher's technical team of people does a phenomenal job of putting together such an impressive film. The sound designers put a heavy use of SFX to help build scenes of tension. Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography is made up of fluid tracking shots and low-key lighting, which creates dimly lit sets that reflect the dark world that the characters are trapped in. Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross's music score creates a very eerie atmosphere that helps put the viewer right into the situations that the characters are in. Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter's editing (which both won Oscars for) is crisp, clean, and to the hilt with perfection.However, what 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' lacks is story structure. It's not an issue of too much plot, but rather a story that feels rushed. For instance, the relationship that builds between Mikael and Lisbeth happens very quicklyÂ…in fact so quick that it is almost ludicrous. In one scene, Lisbeth recoils when Mikael leans his arm over her. Ten minutes later in the movie, the two have aggressive sex. There is no breathing room for the characters to grow attracted to one another. Then again, it could be just a casual sex relationship, but I never got that assumption between Lisbeth and Mikael. The ending also runs into this problemâ€”it is almost as if the screenwriters were running out of time and they tried to compress as much as they can in as fast as possible.'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' does not drag in its pace, so the additional time it would have taken to fix these issues would not have damaged the overall film. It is better to have a three hour film that is not compressed in terms of plot than a 2.5 hour one that is squeezed tightly. Even so, I am glad that I have a copy of this movie and I will watch it multiple times. It is worth noting that this is a very disturbing film. It's not violent like a slasher flick, but it deals with graphic depictions of rape and torture. This is purely an adult movieâ€”and a great one at that!",9,2,7,24 March 2012
Shrek Forever After," Though not the best, 'Shrek Forever After' is a good wrap-up for the series
","I didn't see this in theaters, fearing that it would be lame like 'Shrek the Third'. Learning that my cousins had rented 'Shrek Forever After', I thought why not kill an hour and a half. To my utter surprise, I found myself laughing on almost all levels as in the first two Shreks. The Disney spoofs, sense of ridiculous (such as bringing back the gags of exploding birds and frogs being blown up as balloons), and a good villain is all present.The cast is there, delivering witty lines at their brilliant best. Will Dohrn as Rumpelstiltskin tops all of them. I've never heard of the actor but he should definitely consider doing more work in voice talent. His inflection brings life to the petite, annoying, and menacing Rumpelstiltskin. In short, the voice fits him perfect, like John Lithgow as Lord Farquaad in the first Shrek.The animation is brilliant in all aspects, ranging from the intense action sequences to the emotions that the characters display through their facial expressions. Well done. And once again, the humor is there and clever. But what this Shrek lacks is a witty plot. It falls into a ripoff of 'It's a Wonderful Life.' If I could live without my family in existence, what could possibly go wrong? Only trouble. We've all heard the same mumble jumble. The ending does lead to one dark direction, but it pulls off a surprise happy ending. It makes sense for this, I mean, it's Shrek. He has to win.In short, though not the best, 'Shrek Forever After' is a good wrap-up for the series. Let's hope this is the last Shrek.My rating: 3 out of 4",8,0,0,16 December 2010
Collateral," A true scary, nightmare thriller for cab drivers!
","i really enjoyed this film. it is of the better of most films made these days, on the top ten best of this year's best! The two performacnes of Jamie Foxx and tom Cruise are extreme! all the movies i've seen of Cruise, he has a played a hero who can be a wimp. However, Collateral and The Last Samurai are two of his best films. these films changed my thoughts about him dramatically from dreadful, to awesome! I honestly have never heard of Jamie Foxx, but this film proved he is useful. Now director Michael Mann, i never thought he would do this kind of movie, but no one better could have done it than the Mann. His crime film HEAT however is still slightly better than this film, mainly because do of actors. Cruise, Foxx, and Smith saved the film, the rest I don't care for. I enjoyed the action sequences, the talks of philosophy, the music, and the story itself of two totally different personalities colliding into an act of violence. 9/10 for Collateral! Watch out cab drivers for a scare!",9,0,0,9 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Alfonzo has directed the best Harry Potter film ever!
","I honestly thought that this film was going to be a failure, but I was proven wrong. It is better than the first two films! Not necessarily a triumph over the others though. The prisoner of Azkaban was always my least favorite of the series. To me, the book was too dark. the movie was dark though too. I say the first two films are based upon the magic of Hogwarts while the third is about the true, present darkness of the wizard world. I will not say anymore, so I won't be considered a spoiler! the film is also different for many reasons and the same. here's a list of differences and similarities.Same:                                    Differences: 1.) cast members                        1.) New Dumbledore 2.) Music theme                         2.) New locations 3.) location                            3.) More maturity/teenage like 4.) A child film                        4.) Darker cinematography/story 5.) An unsolved mystery                 5.) New teachers/clothing The differences are more approving than the similarities. however, it has amazed how much the cast as AGED!! Snape has aged, Neville is thin, Harry, and his two friends. Also Malfoy has a RIDICULOUS haircut, and is more of a 'pussy'! (Watch the film, witness what happens to him.) I also noticed more things happened in the background, more moving pictures, creatures and entertainment. the actor who played Dumbledore did not do a bad job! He did well, but his beard looked RIDICULOUS! the music was more teenage like, the action was more intense, the humor, more hilarious, and the grounds of Hogwarts was a lot more explored, which i was most glad about!",8,0,0,15 June 2004
Ratatouille," A new look at animation
","Since 'Finding Nemo' and 'The Incredibles', I haven't' seen a highly dynamic 3-D animated film. I entered the theater with an open-mind for 'Ratatouille', and I have to say that this animated film has redeemed the name of animation.The quality of the animation was absolutely awe-inspiring! The details of the characters were very creative and authentic; the fur on the rats looked like fur rather than computer-animated figures and the humans were in a very retro-styled fashion, matching Brad Bird's past 'The Incredibles'. But the thing that fascinated me the most with the animation was how well the action sequences were choreographed and how amazing they were to watch, especially with the scooter chase with Skinner and the rat Remy.The voices were distinctive and talented; having no feel of a celebrity's voice being attached to them like Shrek. The story is on the childish side of the irony of a rat having a sudden, but beautiful passion of being cook of fine food, but like all other Pixar films, it has a good moral to it. The approximate time of the film maybe almost two hours, which is long for an animated film, but it, does not drag.But the thing that bothered me with this was that it had two unnecessary scenes of guns. Personally, for a G-rated film, that's a bit over the top. And there were also some minor scenes of unpleasant death threats that some of the character's made to each other, as well as some inappropriate innuendos. It should have gotten a PG rating in my mind.Otherwise, great fun and 'wow' to Pixar animators. 9/10 -I'd be a little suggestive for your younger kids parents.",9,4,6,28 July 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man," Like a fly in a spider's web...
","Another 'Spiderman' film? Really? Only five years after the third one? Hollywood has shown time and again of reinventing original stories, including comics, and hoping for the best. Many have failed and a few have succeeded. 'The Amazing Spiderman' reworks the rise of Peter Parker as the super hero, vigilante. The plot is essentially the same as the 2002 release of 'Spiderman,' but the mystery of his parents is included (though unresolved at this time) and the CGI has vastly improved. There is also a new villain and cast. I personally find Tobie McGuire to be a bland actorâ€”even as Spidey. Andrew Garfield has taken up the new mantle and does an exceptionally better job. He physically transforms himself from the sympathetic Eduardo we have seen in 'The Social Network' into a socially awkward yet fun Peter/Spiderman. It is obvious that he is enjoying himself every minute on camera, especially when he encounters a car thief about to hijack car. As the thief pulls a knife, Spiderman cowers and says, 'Oh no! You've found my weakness. Small knives!' Then, squishÂ…squish-squish-squish-squish! He incarcerates the man in webs.The other actors in this film are not of the same caliber as Andrew Garfield, yet they add admirable diligence to their roles. Among them is Martin Sheen as Peter's Uncle Ben, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey (no Mary Jane this time folks), and Denis Leary as the cop destined to capture Spiderman. The film itself moves at a steady pace and covers a lot of ground, but not enough to totally satisfy me. Things are still unresolvedâ€”no doubt intentional for a sequel. Yet again, another super hero franchise has caught my attention. I am trapped like a fly in a spider's web, curiosity still getting the best of me. Like millions of others, I will have to wait for the next film to learn the untold story of Peter Parker.",8,2,5,23 July 2012
The Lego Movie," Everything is awesome
","K-NEX and Legos. Those were the building toys I grew up on. They were awesome. A Lego Movie did not sound awesome. It actually seemed ridiculous and just overall bad. It took a bit of persuasion from a friend to see this movie. Only 10 minutes into watching it, my verdict was immediate awesomeness. The story itself is really not that great. It's orbital protagonist is Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary guy who is considered to be 'the chosen,' who will obtain a mystical item called the 'resistance piece' and vanquish Lord Business (Will Ferrel), who has enslaved just about all the people in Lego World into a strict, scheduled, totalitarian government. He is aided by some other fellow lego characters and is mercilessly pursued by Bad Cop (Liam Neeson). This all sounds like a clichÃ©d plot.But, what makes 'The Lego Movie' awesome is all its other recipes. The animation, combined with both CG and stop motion, is flawless and glorious to watch. I recommend viewing it on a big TV screen (I did not see it in theater, so I can only imagine its fun magnitude). The colors and animation are beautiful. The voice acting cast is perfect. Additional names include Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Morgan Freeman, and Charlie Day. Arnett and Neeson steal the show as Batman and Good Cop Bad Cop. I never would have taken Neeson for comedy. He does two interchanging voices so well that I can't take him seriously, as intended for the movie of course. Perhaps the best part is the overall fun that the movie delivers. It gives a nostalgic look back on childhood and parodies so many other games, movies, characters, and toys to the point that I was laughing non-stop. Batman, Superman, The Green Lantern, Abe Lincoln, Han Solo, Chewbecca, Gandalf, Dumbledore, and Unikitty all make hysterical appearances. I can't think of any rating other than a perfect score to give this movie. It's not the best movie ever made, but just like the song in the beginning of the movie, 'Everything is awesome.'",10,0,2,30 July 2014
Aliens," A sequel that is better than the original
","The first film was impressive, scary, and had my heart racing with adrenaline. This film carries the same intensity as its prequel, but this film broadens with not only its spookiness, but also with its amazing grandeur of of a new leap in visual effects. In its time, the first film had great effects, not to judge, but it was a bit on the hokey side. But with this sequel, even in my opinion till today's standards, it has awesome visual effects.The director, James Cameron, easily among the most inspiring directors of all time, captures such a story like aliens with a combination of horror, and visual effects that look real and captivating. Sigourney Weaver, plays once again as Ripley, delivering an even better performance than the first, which she received an Oscar nom for.Awakening 57 years after the events from the first film, she learns that colonists have lived on the alien planet for sometime. But when humans loose contact from them, Ripley is sent in to lead a high-tech squad of soldiers to find what had happened to them. She is followed up with an all-star cast, such Bill Paxton, Michael Beihn, and other cast members as the hot-headed, overachieving, and rather humorous band of soldiers, and Carrie henn plays the adorable and cautious Newt, who is the only surviving colonist.With her case, she and Ripley develop a strong and believable, relationship, of similar individuals in similar circumstances. Once again, the Aliens films prove to be among the most intense sci-fi films ever brought to life. It's a great sequel that towers over its prequel. People may differ with this, but I certainly don't.",10,3,5,16 December 2006
Dallas Buyers Club," An ultimate character study that shows us how one man can evolve and live with dignity
","'Dallas Buyer's Club' is about Ron Woodroof, a man who works as an electrician and moonlights as a rodeo rider. To say in the least, this film is a character study. The opening scene sets the standard for what type of guy Ron isâ€”a sleazy drug abuser and alcoholic who enjoys threesomes with beautiful girls. He is your typical white-trash Texan hick. However, when he turns up HIV positive, or as he calls a 'faggot disease,' this puts him in a situation of desperation. He heads to Mexico in hopes of obtaining a new experimental medication. He later befriends a modestly polite trans-gendered man named Rayon and starts a business with him, which involves smuggling non-FDA approved drugs for AIDS patients and selling them, dubbing this business as The Dallas Buyer's Club. While Ron's character is anything but admirable, his actions prove otherwise. He goes above and beyond to what was initially only helping himself into an individual who cares and assists for those he once discriminated. He evolves and becomes a passionate and larger than life character. Facing imminent death either brings out either the best or worst in us. It is the former with Ron. It's more than comprehensible as to why McConaughey has earned the recognition he has been receiving for his performance. He immerses himself into this person's persona with flawless perfection and he carries the film with bold energy. Viewers might as well forget about the dreadful movies he has made in the past years. This is a new, reborn actor altogether. To make me enjoy a character that I would not normally like in real life is awe- inspiring. Bravo Mr. McConaughey. Bravo!Jared Leto as Rayon takes acting to a new level. Who would have thought that an actor who has not been in a movie for four years could transform his appearance, voice, mannerisms, and personality into a unique character like Rayon? Perhaps even the sturdiest method actors could not master this challenge and Leto does so with finesse. He is a real screen stealer and he plays his character with stark empathy and even a hint of pity. He gives us someone we can care about. I honestly could not get enough of him. I wish he had been given much more screen time. Jennifer Garner fills in as a backseat rider, playing the doctor who tries to help Ron and Rayon. Though she does not achieve greatness as McConaughey or Leto, she does make a likable and emotional character.The visual style relies heavily on a documentary-esque techniqueâ€”mostly hand-held filmed under natural lighting conditions with field/on-location audio recording (note: making some of the dialog hard to hear at times). The cinematographer captures the film's plot with tight close- ups and other claustrophobic-like angles, forcing the audience into the uncomfortable, emotionally intense situations of the characters. The editing progresses the story relatively decently, but it feels rushed in some subplots and overly drawn out in others. The high-pitched frequency sound effect used to emphasis the progressing illness/AIDS symptoms and growing disorientation of the main character adds another measure of subliminal feeling.'Dallas Buyer's Club' is not a movie meant for everyone, especially for people sensitive towards homosexuals and perhaps even die-hard neo-conservatives. Nor is this a fun one to watch on a day-to-day basis. This is a film that stands on goodness and shows us that despite all circumstances, one man can change and try to make a positive difference for others who cannot. It also shows us that people like Ron Woodroof will not go down in death without dignity or a fight. 9/10This is one of the best films of the year.",9,2,2,7 February 2014
The Exorcist," Unforgettable
","I've heard of this movie through my entire life, but I had not seen it until a few a weeks ago. For a movie that is almost forty years old, I'm still thinking about it. There are many words that can describe 'The Exorcist'. Enchanting. Brilliant. Frightening. Intense. Powerful. Creative. Disturbing. Shocking. These are just a few words that come to mind. The story is simple enough. Innocent girl possessed by a demon. But what makes 'The Exorcist' different from any horror film is that it's not about blood and gore like most slasher films, and there are characters we care about, rather than just a bunch of airheads in which we tend to find ourselves rooting for the villain to slaughter them. Yes, there is plenty of disturbing scenes throughout 'The Exorcist', but it's a character-driven film. That's what I really enjoyed about this movie.All the performances are brilliant. Ellen Burstyn perfectly conveys the tension and fear a mother would experience during such a horrific supernatural event. Max Von Sydow (who's only in the movie for about twenty minutes) gives a performance that should've won him an Oscar. He conveys the sense of hope in the film. His words, 'The power of Christ compels you!' still rings in my mind.Jason Miller expresses the sadness and imperfection that every person experiences, which is particularly unique since his character is a priest. And I can't forget Linda Blair as the little girl who's possessed. Even though Mercedes McCambridge did the voice of the demon (a voice that I will never forget), Blair's facial expressions and actions throughout the film as she transforms from good to evil is nothing short of perfect. And the fact she did this role at such a young age should've also garnered her an Oscar.The other aspect I cannot overlook in this film is the technical feats. As an individual whose just finished learning video production, I found the works of cinematography, editing, and sound design to be top-notched, even by today's standards. I mean, the filmmakers made a bed float in the air before the invention of CGI! That cannot be beaten. And the whole 'Exorcist' sequence, well, I'll just say I could not keep my eyes off of the screen. I've now have come to appreciate William Friedkin as a legendary director for pulling off such a brilliant film.This movie won 2 Oscars back in 1974 for adapted screenplay and sound. Yet again, another superior film has been screwed over by the academy. I try not to put much stock in awards, but 'The Exorcist' is a rare jewel that should not have been so sourly overlooked. This may be a horror film, but it's not like any other one. There's plot, characters, symbolism, and important messages of self-sacrifice and the presence and triumph over unimaginable evil. Of all the words I've used to describe this film, there is one that can sum it up. Unforgettable.****/****",10,3,5,19 April 2010
Gandhi," Almost perfect
","For a long time I wanted to see this movie, but the rental stores doesn't have it, and it's always checked out at the library. This movie had to be either really good (since it's a winner of 8 Oscars) or my luck is short. Either way, I finally got a chance to see Gandhi. After seeing it, I can understand why it was always checked out of the library.I always found Richard Attenborough to be a good actor, but he's better at directing. He captures many wonderful scenes in this movie during Gandhi's life, particularly his thought-provoking speeches that left me speechless and the Amritsar Massacre that left me shocked. Not only did Attenborough's direction capture the film, but also with Ben Kingsley's performance. I've only seen him in two other films and he was great in both, but this is his trademark role. I did not see an actor, but Gandhi himself.In addition, the cinematography pulled me into the film with its beautiful colors and photography of the landscapes. The score (although small compared to John Williams for E.T.) adds a touch to the film's story as well as the Indian culture. The set-decoration and costume design makes an authentic look to the time period and location as well.But there's one thing that this film lacked, an emotional impact. I will admit that Ben Kingsley delivered lines that sent chills down my spine and wisdom to my ears, such as, 'An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.' However, the actors don't make me cry or moved. It seemed that was left for other departments such as: the director, composer, and cinematographer, but they can only do so much. Compared to 'The Extra-Terrestrial' I found myself crying with Drew Barrymore when E.T. dies and when E.T. says, 'I'll be right here' before he leaves to go home. That's power Gandhi does not have enough of, which I anticipate for a multi Oscar-winning movie.I may sound biased since E.T. was a movie I grew up with as a child, but it is a stronger film than Gandhi. Nonetheless, I am glad that Kingsley and Attenborough got the Oscars for actor and director, but picture should have most definitely been given to E.T. 9/10",9,1,2,7 June 2008
Pearl Harbor," A Jerry Bruckheimer failure!
","A not so triumphant film! The cast is well, the effects were fantastic, and the battle sequences pass, but the story itself, is a failure. A love story in war, i don't think so. this movie rants and raves as a girl flick of a love story. Pearl Harobr was not a love story. It was a story of over 2,000 Americans being bombarded by the Japs. the girl i think was unattractive. but thank the lord that Ben's girl was not in that film. Ben Affleck should have died in that film like josh Hartnett. That was the only real part i liked besides the huge battle. i can't believe people like this film. it is a loss. Michael bay made this film by accident. the battle in fact was cartoonish. Planes could not fly that low and not be shot down. those planes were ten feet long and wide, and wight thousands of pounds. ridiculous. If you like this film, go shoot yourself! 5 out of 10 because of effects, cast members, and an o.k. battle sequence.",3,0,2,1 June 2004
Tropic Thunder," Great characters make a great comedy...
","I had no idea what to expect from this movie. Was it going to be horrible? Hysterically good? Or just lukewarm? For starters, I'll say 'Tropic Thunder' is not a movie for everyone. It contains a substantial amount of swearing, some unpleasant gory images (used for comic effect like Monty Python), and even contains some material that people may find indirectly offensive, but I like it.The reason why I like this movie is because of the characters. Stiller, Black, and Downey Jr. lead an ensemble cast of Hollywood big shots trying to make a Vietnam War picture. Nothing seems to go right, so the director, with the advice of a Vietnam veteran (Nick Nolte) decides to take the actors out into the middle of the jungle so they can face the 'real deal'. However, things get out of hand, and what the actors thought of as a movie really isn't.As you can see, the story isn't that special, but each character is unique and funny in their own ways. Ben Stiller is the action hero, a complete spoof off of Sylvester Stallone, Arnold, and even Willem Dafoe (from Platoon). Jack Black is the comedian, a satire off of cheap comedies that Eddie Murphy would star in. And Downey Jr., is the award winner, a spoof of all the great actors ranging from Russell Crowe to Marlon Brando.In addition to these guys, there are many excellent cameos, including: Tobey Maguire, Jon Voight, Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Cruise (strangely dressed up as an obese, bald, Hollywood producer). Every actor in this movie is great and funny. They turn an okay plot into something worthwhile. In addition, there's also a lot of action and nonstop satires against other movies and Hollywood itself.The one thing I have to note, is that people have criticized these movie because of the multiple uses of the word 'retard'. It is used, but not as an insult to the mentally handicapped, but aimed at one of the characters.I enjoyed every moment of this film, from the opening trailer satires to the closing credits. 8/10",8,2,6,17 August 2008
Quantum of Solace," Action over plot...still a Bond though
","With the success of Casino Royale, I just couldn't wait to see its sequel 'Quantum of Solace.' I had heard many negative reviews of this movie and I simply ignored them. I mean, it's a Bond film it has to be good. After thirty minutes into the movie of little dialog and all action, I shrugged thinking, well, there's going to be a plot somewhere. Then an hour went by, and it was still pretty much the same. Only then did I understand why the big reviewers like Ebert were bashing this movie. Sure, a James Bond film is supposed to be action-orientated, but not to the point that, that's the entire movie. Even though I didn't have a stop watch to time the action, I estimate that well over an hour of the film were action and maybe a half hour of plot. Since there were so many action sequences, I easily got bored with the film and could not keep up with the wandering plot, which has as many holes as James Bond's car in the opening car chase/shoot-out. And to be honest, I was not that impressed with the action sequences. Director Marc Foster relied too much on the hand-held camera. I will say that I am biased against hand-held camera movies, but even Paul Greengrass's 'United 93' and 'Bourne Ultimatum' was fairly easy to see and understand what was happening compared to this. This was really bothersome in the Opera shoot-out, where the film constantly cuts back in forth like a montage between Bond killing bad guys and the opera. Again, I could not see what the heck was happening. Perhaps this was the director's intent? To make me feel nausea? MmmÂ…As with the new villains and girls, they were alright. I will admit that Olga Kurylenko is stunningly gorgeous as Camille, and her character is rather unique for a Bond girl (since she's on a private mission of her own, as well as doesn't play around with Bond in bed). Mathieu Amalric plays a good villain as Dominic Greene, although I think he needed a more sinister name to make him sound more evil like the names Goldfinger and Le Chiffe. He won't go down in history as the greatest Bond villain, but nevertheless he is believable (although at times a wimp). However, Gemma Arteton's character is very annoying, but thankfully she's only in the movie for about 10 minutes so I should not complain too much there. I enjoyed the appearances of Jeffrey Wright and Giancarlo Giannini as Felix and Mathis-who adds some comic relief to the film. Judi Dench is once again herself as M and Daniel Craig, well, I'll just say he's the new Bond and he should be for the next few years. Yes, the film has its flaws such as having action scenes overwhelming a wandering plot, as well as a lame opening song, a 'Goldfinger' rip off, no explanation to the significance to the title and the gun barrel sequence being replaced at the end of the film versus the start, but overall it is a Bond film and without a doubt, a new series will be emerging for the next several years.",5,1,5,19 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," Well done...except for the ending
","If I can sum up 'No Country for Old Men' in a few words I would call it a movie of violent consequences. Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon an aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong. Amidst the dead bodies and heroin, he steals a suitcase that has over $2 million in it. Little does he know what lies ahead of him and what kind of people are after him, including Mexican drug dealers and a psychopathic hit man named Anton Chigurh who likes leaving a trail of dead bodies. With this in motion, the town's sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) discovers the drug deal aftermath and later comes to realize the players behind the slaughter as well as Llewellyn. Can he save Llewellyn and stop the bloody trail?By far, on Javier Bardem's acting as Anton Chigurh, he performs among the most monstrous and frightening villains I have seen on the big screen. He's not like a hit man in a Quentin Tarantino film who smiles, smokes, and dances, wears flashy clothes and is often predictable in his actions. Instead, Javier as Anton is more along the lines of Norman Bates. He's quiet, at most unpredictable, smart, cunning, and emotionless. There is no doubt he will get the Oscar for actor in supporting. If he doesn't, that would be a real shame. In addition, the screenplay by the Coen brothers is brilliant as is their directing talents of making suspense, thrills, and drama. I was on the edge of seat throughout the film. What was nice about this movie is that it does not rely on music to build a suspenseful moment like an M. Night Shyamalan film. Instead, the camera angles and the actors' talents made it intense. The only music I remember hearing in the film was for the ending credits. Josh Brolin is a pretty good protagonist. He's does not play superman-like character, but a man who is just like anyone else, but in a situation that no one would ever want to be in. Woody Harrelson was only in the movie for about a half hour; he still holds to his sense of humor and charm. But the weak line I felt in this film was Tommy Lee Jones. He starts the film with an introduction and for the first ninety minutes of the film is a supporting character. With the last half hour of the film, after the unexpected death of the protagonist, Tommy Lee Jones jumps in as the new good guy. He figures everything out at the end, but doesn't try to track down the bad guys, leaving them to escape Scott free. I almost felt like I was watching a totally different film in the last thirty minutes. The suspense diminishes and it drags with Tommy Lee Jones looking tired and depressed. He then closes the film by mumbling some lines about a couple of dreams he had, which reflects his failures of protecting Llewellyn Moss and his wife, and then the film fades to black.There was quite a few murmurs of disappointment in the theater that I was in. There's no resolution at the end. Maybe this was the directors' doing or if that's how the book ended. Either way, I wanted to know what would happen next. However, the ending gives the implication that the world is full of wicked and crazy people like Anton, but there are also people out there who try to track them down. Unfortunately the hero doesn't get him in this film. As I said in the first paragraph, this film is about violence. It was every as bad as Martin Scorsese's The Departed if not worse in some scenes. There's nothing pleasant or stylish about it like in 300. In fact, several people in the theater with me gasped by the graphic depiction of the violence. When it means 'rated R for strong graphic violence', it means it. I will say this was a very well done movie, but not the best film of the year. I won't be surprised if this wins picture and director at the Oscars, but my vote is for There Will Be Blood over this one. There's a more solid story there. 9/10",9,4,9,11 February 2008
District 9," A unique surprise but still flawed
","Many science-fiction films I have seen are about aliens taking over our world. What 'District 9' has in store is not the same nor the opposite, but the idea that an alien species lands on Earth and are at the mercy of us. After seeing this movie, it makes me wonder, if aliens ever land on Earth, would we be so cruel to them? Would we only keep them alive for our advantages in weapons and technology? This main concept of the film, in my mind, is what makes it unique. I appreciate the filmmakers in keeping this film quiet until its release today, for it is quite an interesting surprise. The film itself is presented like a documentary, with a lot of hand-held work and characters talking directly to the camera, explaining to the audience the story about these aliens. This really helped in developing the plot, but it wasn't enough. There were several things left unexplained and felt rushed. I don't want to give even more of the story away, but I have to mention two things I found awkward.One, the movie does not explain how the aliens understand our language, much less how we would understand there's (which is made up of deep clicks by the way). There are many scenes throughout the film where a human would talk to an alien, and it would understand them and vice versa. The other thing is how poorly the government enforces the isolation of the aliens from humans.It is made very clearly that humans do not want to be around them, yet Nigerian gang bangers somehow live alongside the aliens in the slums, selling them food and weapons, as well as scamming them. Why would the government allow this? This leads to another issue on the barbarism and witchcraft, in which these gang bangers believe eating aliens makes you have their 'special powers'. This added no relevance to the story whatsoever.There is plenty of blood/gore in the film, especially at the end where there is more firepower occurring than any of the 'Rambo' movies combined together. It's almost as if Neill Blomkamp wanted to sicken the audience even more, showing us how messed up people, particularly ones who live in Africa, really are. It is understandable for shock value. I'll admit that this movie would have been pretty hokey if it were a PG-13. The R was needed, but it didn't need to go Paul Verhoeven on us. A final remark I'll make about this film is the choice of actors. I didn't recognize any of them but they all did a swell job. It proves that it doesn't take a big Hollywood star to sell a movie. 'District 9' is not a movie for everyone, particularly for little kids. The aliens in some instances may look cute but there is plenty of 'bloody violence' and 'pervasive language'. This movie will probably receive mixed reviews, but I find it to be a decent one, though not spectacular.",5,4,15,14 August 2009
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Fun, cheap style over earthy substance...Peter Jackson, what has happened to Middle-earth?
","I am probably in the minority who love 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.' Yes, it does not have the same epic feeling that Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings Trilogy' has nor does it have the flawless combination of old-style effects and CGI, but it is still fun, large in scope and imagination. And besides, who cannot despise the magical world of Middle-Earth? In loving the first Hobbit movie, I had high hopes for Smaug. A more promising Metacritic score of 66/100 appears to boost both the hype and my anticipation of this film. Within the first 10 minutes of the feature, I knew I was in for a ride...and not necessarily the one I was expecting or hoping for.This Hobbit film unfortunately does not have a real plot like 'An Unexpected Journey.' Rather, it is a series of events based around Tolkien's book that are then meshed into a completely different concept. First, there is the Hobbit Bilbo and the company of dwarfs who seek the reclamation of their lost home Erebor, overtaken by the dragon Smaug. There is the wizard Gandalf, who suddenly abandons his post as a guide to the dwarfs in order to set off on a more vital matter, which foreshadows to the enemy that is present in 'The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.' There are the elves, Legolas and Tauriel, who pursue the dwarfs to stop their quest, only to stumble upon something that is even bigger at stake. Lastly, there is Bard, a fisherman turned smuggler that aids Bilbo and the dwarfs, who is destined to become an unlikely hero. This is a lot of ground covered in the 161 minute film. At times, it becomes discombobulating as each story jumps to and fro. With so much information happening, characters are quickly thrown in and then some are just as swiftly forgotten--often left without further reference. In some instances this works whereas others, it just feels like bad writing. I have read the book twice and Tolkien did this with some of his characters. I understand his reasoning for that. In the movie, however, I do not. Making matters worse is a love story that is thrown in between an elf and a dwarf. This has absolutely no meaning or purpose to the overall story arc. It is just a lame way of drawing in the young, female viewer demographics. Peter Jackson has drifted so far off from the original novel, that this is something entirely different. This surprisingly does not bother me so much though. I expected him to add padding for cinematic effect. He did the same thing for his first Hobbit film. What bothers me though is that cohesiveness in storytelling is no longer present. The ending in particular left me cold and without any closure or sense of a resolution. It feels as if Peter Jackson has decided to turn his movie into a simple marketing stunt for money rather than give us an enjoyable, plot and character-driven narrative that we have seen from his first trilogy. I feel kind of bad writing this, but it is honestly true. Another big drawback to this movie is the visual effects. Some scenes are very impressive, specifically with the dragon Smaug and the Necromancer (both miraculously voiced by the awesome Benedict Cumberbatch). Most other scenes are lower quality, like out of an XBOX game console. The CGI orcs and the famous barrel sequence are like something out of a 3D cartoon rather than a big-budget movie. The soft focus and dim lighting on Orlando Bloom as Legolas is really bad--no doubt a cheap method to make him look younger. Multiple times, I found myself groaning inside. 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' is not a complete loss. I was still entertained. No boredom kicked in. Indeed, it is a very fast-paced movie. The action is fun despite its corniness and lack of photo-realistic detail. The other elements of a big budget such as make-up, costumes, and elaborate set pieces are great enough to bring a sense of realism to Tolkien's world. The city of Laketown is really noteworthy in terms of its production values. I have no real regrets in seeing the movie. I just wished Peter Jackson held up to his marvelous magnificence instead of sink down to the level that Lucas did with his 'Star Wars Prequels.' My final comment: Peter Jackson, what has happened to your creation of Middle- Earth?My generous rating: 7/10",8,2,4,24 December 2013
Batman Begins," The ULTIMATE Super hero experience!!!!!!
","This is truly the best super hero film I have seen since the 1989 Batman! This rocked! I was not bored at all from start to finish! I also have to say that when I watched this film, I felt like I was inside the film with the characters! I have not had that feeling at all this year from any of the films I have seen, besides Cinderella Man and Star Wars.This is much better than the average comic book film that is usually so stylized, that it becomes stupid like the last two Batman films, directed by Schumacher. This film is basically the start of Bruce Wayne, becoming batman, in a whole new, alternate version.Yes, his parents were slain before him, and feeling that he must seek justice and vengeance against the evilness of Gotham city, he disappears to China, of where he meets a man (Liam Neeson), who helps fulfill his quest. From here on is the action-packed film that starts an unforgettable tale of good vs. evil. The villains are hateful and dark in this film, the film itself is dark, and there's unpredicted twists and guest appearances of well known actors.The two and a half hour film flew by for me! There's a lot of up close in your face action, especially the brutal hand-to-hand. I warn fans now, it is much darker and intense than the average Batman flick, but it is also much better!!! Truly, the ULTIMATE super hero experience. 5 out of 5 stars. See it, it is truly worth it!",10,2,4,19 June 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Peter Jackson has brought us back the magical world of Middle Earth and it is still as entertaining, fantastic, and magical ever
","After seeing the 'Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' back in December 2003, I could not help but wonder when Peter Jackson was going to make 'The Hobbit.' Sitting in my theater seat yesterday afternoon, with dozens of other patrons, I found myself with all smiles through Jackson's release of 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.' Many things happen in the book, and it is wise on Jackson's part to split it up into multiple films. This movie ties in important events that lead up to 'The Lord of the Rings Trilogy,' incorporates parts of Tolkien's fifth 'The Simallarion,' and displays different perspectives of the world Middle-Earth. No doubt, much of this may come off as needless padding so to make the film longer and expand the novel into three films. Nevertheless, all of these additions help carry the film's plot along; it helps rather than hinders the story. Similar faces return the screen, such as Ian McKellan as Gandalf the Grey, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, and Chistopher Lee as Saruman. In addition, there are many new faces. Michael Freeman plays a younger Bilbo Baggins and Richard Armitage is the Dwarven king Thorin. While McKellan, Weaving, Blanchett, and Lee simply reprise their roles, the new members to the Middle Earth world give us characters we care for. Freeman plays Bilbo to the teeâ€”an arrogant, reluctant protagonist who at first seems wrapped up in his little hole in the ground, but becomes a small fella we admire and watch as he triumphs over seemingly impossible odds. Armitage appears a little distant in his character, but this grows apparent as the film's plot progresses, and with good reason. The other actors do a fine job as bringing the novel's characters to life, especially Sylvester McCoy as the crazed, mushroom-eating wizard Radagast the Brown. What impressed me the most about 'The Hobbit' is that Peter Jackson has brought us back to the visually mesmerizing world of Middle-Earth. This is his world, and I am glad that he is in the director's seat instead of Guillermo del Toro. Jackson has that strong attention to detail, which makes him such a great director. And when he directs, he is never at arm's length with his subjects or methods of storytelling. He makes it his goal to make the viewers appreciate the wonders of this fantasy world he has presented to us on the big screen. In other words, when I watch this movie, I am not busy paying attention to the cinematography, the set pieces, the costumes, the make up, or even the effects and actingâ€”I am focused on being sucked into the marvels of imagination. A movie is not just a movie; it is a flawless form of escapism. That is what I love about 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' and director Peter Jackson. No other filmmaker could do this with Tolkien's world. If I had to make one criticism about this film, it would be the CGI. While the 'Lord of the Rings Trilogy' was abundant in this department, it did not overuse it. The fight scenes were choreographed with actors in make-up and costumes. However, in 'The Hobbit,' all of the monsters are computer-generated. While this works in some places, it turns other scenes into a cartoon rather than a realistic fantasy. This may have been done as a means for the film to be converted into 3D, but it sacrifices the movie's look. Even so, I refuse to give 'The Hobbit' a lower score over this discrepancy. This movie is among the best in the fun, entertaining, and fantasy arena. I hope it earns many accolades in the technical department. 10/10",9,6,17,24 December 2012
Non-Stop," A good thriller with a great actor
","Enter Liam Neeson. From the opening shot of him sitting in a car alone, with the most devastated expression imaginable, we clearly understand the character he will be portraying for this movie. In 'Non-stop' he is Bill Marks, an air marshal. He is burned out, struck by tragedy, and an alcoholic. His already harsh life gets worse when he gets a text message from an unknown individual, claiming that if he or she does not receive $150 million, he or she will kill a person within every 20 minutes until the demand is met. Matters grow worse when he is targeted as a scapegoat from the terrorist's antics. Bill has to battle the clock to disclose this person's identity, protect the passengers, and even save his reputation. This is just another adventure for the past middle-aged action star. What differentiates Neeson from other formulaic, action stars is his capacity to deliver excellent performances. Single-handedly, the opening scene supports his acting caliber. He can display so much without uttering a word. That is reason enough for me to consider him a favorite. He does more than well as Marks. The screenwriter for the film thought out the story decently. There are twists, turns, unpredictably, and full-blast intensity. The viewer feels the paranoia of the central character as he desperately searches for the culprit. I tend to guess tend to guess in the end who is the bad guy, but not for this one. It is a roller coaster that shifts one direction for a moment and then takes another. When the revelation arrives though, it falls flat and feels downright pretentious. The ending is particularly rushed and pushes belief a bit too far. 'Non-stop' is a good thrill ride with a great actor. It warrants a viewingÂ…two in my case.",7,0,1,2 August 2014
Saving Private Ryan," My point of view...I'm not sure to cry or vomit!
","I still remember seeing this film almost five years ago, and I was never so sickened by any film in my life! Why? Because Spielberg gave us a hell of a view of war!!! This film is not that of history, save for the opening, gore fest battle that contained more than blood and missing limbs like previous war films like Platoon or Glory. I can easily understand that war is hell, which I'm glad Spielberg revelaed to the world for a change. I'm not a gore lover, but this really caught me off guard since I'm used to such violence from films as of Braveheart and The Full Metal Jacket. However, I have to confess that all I got from this film was blood and guts.So, after an agonizing thirty minutes of constant brutality, the film picks up with a story of about a band of four brothers, three of them are already dead, and only one remsins. So, a small force of eight men, including portrayals of popular stars such as Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore, who didn't do much except shoot Germans with machine guns. They are to find this man, retrieve him before he is killed, which would result in the devastation of a his family. A very selfless task it is, but as the man Ryan is found, after another hour and a half of no character development with these eight men, no feeling for them, or tears and grief...at least from me, and Ryan says he refuses to leave.I laugh and the only reason why this is so is because Spielberg wants another bloody mess, feeling he hasn't shown enough killing! So, another battle happens, with more deaths of both Germans and Americans, leaving this whole film into a usless flashback. So, that's the whole film in a way.I may sound to hate this film, but I don't, but I'm tired of people claiming this is the best war film ever! Heck, other films I've listed above are better than this for goodness sake! However, the realism was well depicted, the music was haunting, and sad, but I had no feeling, except for wanting to lose my lunch in the pit of my stomach, and the usage of sound mixing, editing, and cinematography was truly Oscar worthy. So, since Spielberg put effort into this film, I give a generous ***1/2 out of *****.Seriously, I got nothing accept horrible images, and yearning for a bucket in this two hour and fifty minute film.",8,3,7,6 January 2006
The Pianist," A movie that should not be forgotten nor overlooked by audiences everywhere.
","I was reluctant to see this movie at first because I thought it was going to be a copycat off of Steven Spielberg's 'Schindler's List'. Since he was among the first to depict the inhumanity and horrors of the Holocaust, I thought 'The Pianist' would be weak in comparison. After more than five years of its release, I finally decided to sit down and watch 'The Pianist'.Since seeing Polanski's 'Chinatown' (earlier this summer), never have I been so captivated by a movie. There is no comparison between this and 'Schindler's List'. Both are two totally different movies. After saying that, 'The Pianist' is about the life of musician Wladyslaw Szpilman, who works at a radio station during WWII.Adrian Brody is subtle and marvelous as Szpilman. I've only seen him in a couple of movies, and this is his best work. The uniqueness of his character is that he's an ordinary man thrown into hellish circumstances. He gets separated from his family; he survives the termination of the Warsaw Ghetto, and the many battles that erupt in Poland. Everything is shown from his viewpoint. It is very disturbing and shocking, reminding me and audiences everywhere what had happened only sixty years ago.Roman Polanski captures these scenes unusually. He doesn't just throw them in your face, but keeps them in Szpilman's point of view. For instance, in the Warsaw Ghetto, there's a scene where a family is massacred because they're awake during curfew. Rather than showing it up-close, it keeps it is at a distance in the apartment of where Szpilman is hiding. This adds to the fear you feel for his character and safety. The works of the score and cinematography adds to the film's mood and plot. Of all the scenes in this film, the one that moved me the most is when Szpilman is forced to play the piano by Captain Hosenfeld. As he plays the piano, the expressions Brody reveals are tear-jerking. He's sad for what he has witnessed and the losses he had suffered, yet also he is happy because he's playing the piano, his one true love. As those emotions collide, they reflect not only how passionately he plays the piano, but also on his character's demons and struggles that he shows through indescribable facial expressions. I personally feel this is why he got his Oscar, which is very fair.'The Pianist' is a movie that should not be forgotten nor overlooked by audiences everywhere. The only disappointment I have toward this movie is that it did not get Best Picture for the year 2002. 10/10",10,0,0,15 August 2008
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A comic masterpiece of cinema
","Wes Anderson is a filmmaker that I consider an acquired taste. You either like his movies or you don't. His style of humor ranges from being strange and shocking, off-colored and off the wall, to intelligent and witty. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' takes this trio of humor and blends them into a masterpiece of comic cinema. The story is so simple that I can write a book about it. It's central figure, a Lobby boy at the Grand Budapest Hotel, tells his story about the concierge Gustave H and the adventures he shared with him. These include but are not limited to murder, creepy assassins, prison escapes, ski chases, war, an all out shootout, a girl with a Port wine stain that is shaped like Mexico, and a painting of a Boy with an Apple. One funny scenario after another happens with these two characters as they carry out their journey. Many gags are thrown in just for laughs while others require more thinking, specifically the reoccurring spoofs on past cinema genres. Aspect ratios change through out the film, key lights turn on off, a blade is referred to as 'the throat slitter,' and even Adrian Brody walks in slow-motion after a potential victim with a tensed-filled soundtrack. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a movie to enjoy simply because of its frequent gags and well-timed one-liners. It can also be enjoyed because of its great cast. Wes Anderson went all out on the type of actors he chose for his movie. Ralph Fiennes, Adrian Brody, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, F. Murray Abraham, Owen Wilson, Saorise Ronan, Willem Dafoe, and Jeff Goldblum are only some of the names in this film. Surpassing all of them, who would have thought that Ralph Fiennes as Gustave H could deliver such excellent comic timing? He gives us a character that is sophisticated yet memorable. His character is not someone to like in real-life. However, the audience cannot help but adore and cherish his personality. Gustave H is a manipulator of sorts and as such a character, Fiennes charmed the theater with boisterous laughter. I now see Mr. Fiennes in a whole new light. Voldemort, whom I've nicknamed him for a long time, can be hysterical. The rest of the cast members turn in good, quirky performances, but it is still Fiennes who steals the show. As already stated, the plot is straightforward. Nonetheless, it is fun. Every passing moment grows better and better. As the movie draws to a close, I feel as if I had experienced a comic journey that I want to relive some time soon. This is a rare film in which I can picture myself watching this movie over and over again and notice something new that is hysterical. Indeed, the gags go by fast. While I laugh at one, I may well have missed the following one. 'The Grand Budapest' is a comic masterpiece of cinema. The average Joe can like it as well as the artistic minded moviegoer.",10,3,12,21 March 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Another great installment to the M:I series
","Walking into the theater I was expecting a good action flick, even if it is the fourth installment of the Mission Impossible series. Seeing this on IMAX, I was not disappointed. The action sequences are intense, fun, and very memorable. One in particular that I cannot help but be enticed by are the scenes where Tom Cruise climbs up and runs down the Burj Khalifâ€”the tallest building in the world. This is truly a beautifully shot and crafted sequence. I will note that for those who are afraid of heights might not want to sit through this part of the movie. The plot is basic, but it has the charm and wit of the other M:I movies, such as the occasional quirky dialog and the new gadgets that IMF uses. There are even a couple of twists thrown in, especially a good one towards the end. The cast is mostly decent, but I had a problem with Michael Nyqvist as the villain. His character is not developed at all nor does he pose as a hateful bad guy. He's merely a two-dimensional figure that has a Russian accent to make him seem more menacing. Voight, Dougherty, and Hoffman were so great in the other M:1 features. This new guy though, not so much. There are also some relatively hokey scenes that deem Tom Cruise as invincible; in real life, he would have died soooo many times. Then again, Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt; he can do whatever he wants and not die or sustain serious injury.Overall though, this is a great installment to Mission Impossible series. It's fun, at times intense, and has some stunning visual effects and cinematography. Note, Tom Cruise is going on 50, and he has looked the same for the last 10 years. He either has a really good makeup artist or he has some sort of secret that he's not telling us.",8,6,9,18 December 2011
Foxcatcher," A great movieÂ…falls a little short on the ending
","While 'Foxcatcher' is inspired by real people and events the film's roots are in a psychological examination of its lonesome and disturbed characters. Channing Tatum plays Mark Schultz, the 1984 Gold Medalist in Men's Wrestling. Going nowhere with employment and training, he receives a chance of a lifetime from being recruited by John E du Pont (Carrel), a reserved and awkward multi-millionaire, who wants America to win the gold again in the 1988 Olympics. At Du Pont's mother's farm, he organizes the new US wrestling team for the International games. Their relationship becomes the basis of this film and how it rises and then ultimately deflates. From the first five minutes we are introduced to Du Pont, he is presented as a wealthy, charismatic individual with a peculiar way of speaking and an even more peculiar nose. Progressively, we get to see the type of man Mark has befriended as he spirals out of control, engaging in drug abuse, guns, and irrational behavior. Carrel has performed a role at first glance may seem hard to swallow. However, he portrays his character in such a style that it is truly terrifying. Beneath the hours of make-up, he can display absolute nothingness, uncontrollable rage, and even pure narcissism without even speaking. Director Bennett Miller relies heavily on non-verbal scenes, allowing the silence between the actors on camera to create tension and intriguing interactions. This is a tough accomplishment, and he hits it head-on at every point. The screenwriters supply the actors with straight-to-the-point, yet brilliant dialog, and the cast carry the weight of their characters superbly. Who could have imagined that Channing Tatum or even Steve Carrel could deliver such vulnerable and sophisticated characters? Mark Ruffalo is extremely limited in screen time but he is up to par with his leading co-stars as Mark's caring brother. The only setback 'Foxcatcher' has is the ending. The first 100 minutes are electrifying and engaging, but the final 20-30 minutes kind of meander and depict a series of events that feel woven together. Too much of Carrel and Tatum looking depressed make a snail's pace for the final act. I wanted more character interaction and an actual conclusion that ties in with the violent tragedy of Dave Schultz's murder. It merely happens and Du Pont is arrested. No trial. No final face-to-face showdown between Mark and Du Pont. Not even a moment where Mark mourns his brother. Nor is there a clear motive for Du Pont's crime. As a viewer, the ending is quite cold and rather withholding. 'Foxcatcher' is a great movie. I would definitely buy it when the Blu-Ray hits retail stores. Yet I don't think it is as great as some of the other movies released in 2014.",9,5,11,25 January 2015
Beasts of No Nation," Compelling and PowerfulÂ…but not the best
","This is the movie that made me join Netflix. The trailers looked very promising, and the film does not disappoint. The plot is told from the perspective of Agu (Abraham Attah), a child growing up in an unnamed African country. The first fifteen minutes provides a sense of calm and general happiness, emphasizing the childhood innocence of this boy. He has a loving family and a wild imagination. The story takes a dramatic turn when war breaks out in Agu's homeland, resulting in the separation from his family. Agu is forced into the army as a child soldier. While films like 'Blood Diamond' and 'Lord of War' scratch the surface on child soldiers in Africa, 'Beasts of No Nation' takes you down to its core level. It is brutal, dark, and inhumane. As viewers, we watch as Agu transforms from an innocent boy to a brainwashed killer, under the manipulative powers of the Commandant (Idris Elba).Director Cary Joji Fukunaga does not sugarcoat the barbarity. There are several moments intended to make the viewer uncomfortable, including a harsh scene where a young girl is stomped to death while a group of child soldiers laugh. Despite the graphic violence, Fukunaga does not demonize the children. The director provides us moments where the child soldiers are simply children. They play games and question what their futures will bring. It cannot be said that we necessarily like them, but given their circumstances and the lifestyle that has been forced onto them, they are understandable characters.While Idris Elba has been receiving nominations (including a Golden Globe & SAG) for his role, it is Abraham Attah's performance that makes the movie. He has a talent that most child actors, and many adult-aged actors lack, the ability to convey powerful emotion without uttering a single word. Though unlikely, I hope he secures an Oscar nom for his performance. Idris Elba is convincing as the manipulative and despicable Commandant, but his British accent breaks through on several occasions, pulling me out of several key scenes. The technical skills and Fakunaga's direction are nothing short of remarkable. Fakunaga acted as his own cinematographer for this movie and he does an incredible job. In some instances, he seemed to shadow Terrence Malick's work from 'The Thin Red Line' with his selection of beautiful landscape shots, close-ups of nature, high saturation and natural lighting. The voice-over by Agu adds another layer to this compelling film as he reflects on his past experiences as a soldier.While this is a very good movie, it is not without faults. The last act feels drawn out, making it longer than necessary. The conclusion is particularly weak and withholds any catharsis from the character. A more glaring problem was the thick African accents. They made the English dialogue very hard to understand. It would have been more appropriate if all the characters spoke in their native language and then subtitles were added after the fact. The first fifteen minutes were mostly subtitled, as the rest of the film should have been. 2016 has not been the best year of movies. However, December is the month where the greatest films are usually released. 'Beasts of No Nation' is a compelling and powerful film, and marks one of this year's best. But I would not rank it as one of the best of all time.",8,2,3,12 December 2015
Gone Girl," A twisted, crazy, yet nicely executed mystery...
","When a director crafts a mystery thriller for the big screen, he not only has to be able to spin a good story from his scriptwriter, and show that story with the editor's prowess, and have it performed to ripeness with his actors, but he also has to carry the capacity to intrigue the audience enough and push them beyond their boundaries of excitement and discomfort. David Fincher is a master of these powers and that makes him an awesome filmmaker. He knows how to make a movie stick with you and he takes his viewers to some of the darkest places of the human mind. 'Gone Girl' is one of those good mystery thrillers that do not rely on suspense, thrills, or even a big twist at the endâ€”all the typical makings of such a genre. In fact, I found myself guessing the remainder of the film's plot 30 minutes in. What kept me focused was the brilliantly written dialog and performances by the ensemble cast. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne, a down on his luck writer whose wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) has mysteriously vanished. As time of her disappearance grows longer, he becomes the prime suspect of her possible murder and the center of a media circus that is out for blood. The only solace he obtains is from his hipster twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and a well-known attorney (Tyler Perry), who has a $100,000 retainer. The first hour of the film sets itself up as a realistic mystery, but then switches gears to a psychological drama that borders on horror when the truth behind Amy's disappearance unravels itself. This sudden revelation to a pseudo-film critic may seem like a Brian De Palma/noir femme fatale knockoff, but it actually is a bit of a study on how a terrible marriage can lead to psychopathy. The events that further transpire are messy, twisted, disturbing, gross, and yet exactly what it needs to keep the film going. Without giving much more away, I will mention that ending is quite good and gives the viewer something to think about. Once again, David Fincher has surrounded himself with a great team. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography evokes the natural lighting look combined with deep bluish hues to emphasis the bleak atmosphere. Kirk Baxter's editing is sharp and to the point in showing the plot's progression. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score adds an eerie atmosphere to the film. Fincher's direction displays his ability to capture exceptional performances from his cast. Rosamund Pike makes the movie as a very complicated, multi-layered character that we think we can understand, but we never really can comprehend. Carrie Coon fits in nicely as the supportive sister of Nick. She ranks as probably the most ordinary and down to earth character in the whole film. Even Ben Affleck delivers a fine performance. I never thought of him as much of an actor, but he plays an individual that is trapped in a horrific situation with plausibility. The sound mixing unfortunately lacks quality, making the dialog difficult to hear at times. It feels very much like a rough cut versus a final product. And while I like the ending, there are certain elements that seem to be overlooked or blatantly ignored if the events in the movie happened in a real scenario. In short, 'Gone Girl' proves itself as another great addition to Fincher's impeccable resume and may make the 2015 Oscar season.",9,0,5,9 November 2014
Django Unchained," Take it for a grain salt folks, it's a movie...and a fun one
","Set in 1858, a slave named Django (Jamie Fox) is freed by Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz), a bounty hunter who is after a gang of brothers. Taken under Shultz's wing, Django learns the trade of 'killing white folk and getting paid for it.' Things take a turn when Shultz vows to help Django free his wife (Kerry Washington) from a ruthless plantation owner named Calvin Candie (Leonardo Dicaprio)â€”a very sweet sounding name. Rescuing her though proves much harder than it seems. Breaking away from Quentin Tarantino's normal form of storytelling, 'Django Unchained' is broken up into 3 main acts. The first is the relationship between Django and Shultz, and their adventures. The second is about the Candie plantation and the mission to rescue Django's wife. The third act is the final conclusion. Tarantino does a masterwork with the first two acts. But by the last 40 minutes, the final act drags on much longer than necessary for Tarantino gives us 2 bloody shootouts vs. the typical one. The ending result is obvious. The extended ending and extra carnage is pointless to the overall story. 30 minutes could have been cut from the time length. No doubt Tarantino did this on purpose since he felt his audience had not seen enough death and destruction. When people die in this film, they not only bleed, they spray out gallons of blood and scream as loud as possible. While over the top, it borders on unwatchable. Shootings, beatings, whippings, torture â€”every thing but rape is present in this movie. If it weren't for Quentin Tarantino's name, this film would have probably garnered an NC-17. Tarantino does make up with witty conversations and comical situations that poke fun of the South as a means to lesser the sadistic, violent load. What works exceedingly well in this movie is Tarantino's choice of actors, especially Christoph Waltz, who practically steals the show. In comparison to his Oscar-winning work for Inglourious Basterds, Waltz gives us a surprisingly likable character that has a moral compassâ€”unlike most Tarantino characters. He is a man to admire and his mannerisms as well as the witty script makes him deliver a wonderful performance. Leo Dicaprio's portrayal of Calvin Candie, however, is the polar opposite to Waltz's. One minute he is charming and the next he explodes like dynamite. Dicaprio has truly broken his norm of playing good guys and he does so with panache. Jamie Fox seemed a little apathetic in the start of the film, but as the plot progresses, his character flourishes and his anger becomes more and more understandableâ€”and we root for him as he takes on the racist southerners. Samuel L. Jackson makes a surprise appearance as Candie's adviser Stephen. It is more than obvious that he is just having fun with his role; he incorporates as many black stereotypes as he can. The only downer is Kerry Washington. 90% of the time she either looks terrified or screams. No doubt, much of this is to blame on her poorly developed characterâ€”she's just a victim, nothing more. After while though, her ear-piercing shrieks of pain grow very nauseating. Much of Quentin Tarantino's visual works well for this filmâ€”especially him hiring Robert Richardson as the director of photography. Richardson's use of natural lighting, slow motion, and unique camera angles is something to admire. I particularly like the fast zooms on actor's faces during scenes of tension and quick cuts to reveal flashbacks and violent action. Other trademarks of Tarantino though do not work so well. Blaring hip hop/rap music and pop culture references may work for films like 'Pulp Fiction' and the 'Kill Bill's,' but it feels a bit out of place with a film about the south prior to the Civil War. There are a lot of ways people may interpret this movie. Many will see it as a controversy to due to its graphic violence and depiction of racism. Lesser mind people may see this film as offensive and deems all southerners as evil individuals. Others will see this as another, mindless gore fest. Some may even see it as a satire of slavery, plantation owners, and the South in general. For me, I see it as another fun movie by Quentin Tarantino. So, bashers and offended persons, take this movie as it is, a movie. Unfortunately, his usual trademarks and references are hit and miss, and his story drags unnecessarily long towards the end. 'Django Unchained' is far from a masterpiece, but I appreciate that Tarantino has made another movie.",9,3,9,3 January 2013
Frozen," Merely good
","Disney goes back to its roots of princesses and magical lands in its latest release of 'Frozen.' The main characters are two sister princesses, Anna and Elsa. Anna is a young, cheerful, optimistic protagonist who seeks the love and attention of her sister Elsa. Elsa, is a quiet, introvert that possesses the power of creating and ice snow, which she cannot control, and thus keeps secret from her sister as a means to protect her. The secret becomes exposed and Elsa inadvertently traps the kingdom in an endless winter. It is up to Anna to bring back summer and save her sister from herself. On her journey, she meets a collection of entertaining characters: Christoph, a struggling ice merchant, Sven, Christoph's quiet yet dog-like reindeer, and Olaf, a happy-go-lucky Snowman. One advantage to this new animated feature is the fact that it breaks the norm of many passed Walt Disney shorts. There is no wicked Witch or any evil antagonist in the likes of Ursula from 'The Little Mermaid' or the Queen from 'Snow White.' The core of the story is the relationship between these two sisters and how one of them is willing to cross wintry lands and climb high mountains to save what she preciously desires. This makes a rather unusual plot device and is no doubt a decent attempt to break away or let go from the old clichÃ©s. Simultaneously, the Disney writers throw in plenty of references from past movies such as a true love's first kiss from 'Snow White,' a ballroom dance sequence inspired from 'Cinderella,' and anthropomorphic characters like 'Beauty and The Beast.' Paying homage to past films can be a breath of fresh air if done well, however, they can be overburdening. For much of the film, I kept seeing too much of these past Disney references. I felt like I was watching Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and Snow White compacted into one. The first thirty minutes alone feels like a contrived musical version of all these movies put together in a bundle. It really is not until the forty minute mark when things become really intriguing with the introductions of Sven, Christoph, and Olaf. They are the ones who make this movie interesting. Besides, who can resist a reindeer with a dog-like personality, a carefree, talking Snowman, and a handsome underdog armed with love advice? Without them, the movie would have been a dull chick flick. The animation is breathtaking. The music is beautiful. The song 'Let it go' is something to remember for the ages (Idina has quite a vocal range). 'Frozen' is a movie that I like, but I don't love. It is merely good.",7,1,4,21 March 2014
2012," Roland's last disaster movie...a good one.
","In my opinion, director Roland Emmerich has not had a good streak of movies lately, such as '10,000 B.C.' and 'The Day After Tomorrow'. But on a day I had nothing better to do, I decided to go see his '2012' on the big screen just for the kicks and to my surprise, I enjoyed this movie, and not just for the visual effects. The screenwriters didn't just write page after page, 'big explosions' and 'humans running for their lives'. There's some breathing room for likable characters and a somewhat interesting story. Yes, the story is unrealistic, but it is somehow believable, like it was in 'Independence Day'. And the fact that I cared for the characters, even feeling sad when many of them died, makes it a good film. But the one thing that this film made me wonder is, if the world was coming to an end, would our government tell us? Unlike in 'Independence Day', where the nation's government is depicted as the leading protagonist in the fight for survival, they are depicted as deceitful liars who only care for their own skin. The protagonists in this film are a combination of ordinary people: a middle-class family, a wealthy Russian and his mistress, two Jazz performers, an Indian Scientist and others. I found this rather interesting, the underdogs are where our sympathy lies. Overall, '2012' isn't a bad movie. I wouldn't be antagonized by the 2.5+ hour length, for the film flies by. There are great action sequences, thrills, an interesting plot (though I think some more back story to the whole Mayan prophecy would've helped a bit), and the majority of the cast did a decent job. Each actor made themselves a character, and above all, they each express the fear of trying to survive and its uselessness against complete world destruction. My rating: *** out of ****Roland Emmerich says this his last disaster movie. If it is, it's a good ending.",7,0,0,29 November 2009
Good Will Hunting," A great film!
","Good Will Hunting is a great movie. Of all the films I have seen Matt Damon in, this is the best one. His character isn't an action hero like in the Bourne Trilogy, nor is a comical thief in the Ocean's series. He plays a youth in south Boston, driven by his fears of abandonment and a lack of trust in people. However, his unique math abilities are discovered by a college professor (Stellan Skarsgard) who gives him an opportunity to change his original lifestyle from a street punk to someone of value and good qualities.He later sees a therapist (Robin Williams) and finds a girlfriend (Minnie Driver), who become the two benefactors that ultimately makes him into something more than he ever thought. Besides Matt Damon's Oscar nominated performance, I found Robin Williams to be fascinating. Rob won an Oscar for his role and it is rightfully deserved. He made me laugh and at times put me close to tears from the talks he has with Damon about life and change.The additional performances by Minnie driver, Stellan Skarsgard, Ben and Casey Affleck are all wonderfully. The script by Ben and Matt is both entertaining and genius. The score by Danny Elfman was also a nice addition to film. But I give this move a 9 out of 10 because there was so much unneeded foul language. I'm used to hearing bad words, particularly in the likes of an Oliver Stone and a Martin Scorsese film, but not for something along the likes of Good Will Hunting. I guess Matt and Ben felt they needed f-bombs and other sexual dialog to make the film more real. The film would still be real without them.",9,0,1,29 March 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," As good as its prequel
","In the Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Two Towers was my favorite, but it is as good as the prequel. Peter Jackson won his major triumph again! The thing about the Two Towers is that, it makes everyone wondered what was going to happen, the fellowship was broken and the dark lord is winning over middle-earth.The Two Towers explained the path of the hobbits and the king. The film follows its prequel as did the book as Frodo and Sam make their way towards Mount Doom to destroy the ring of evil. They encounter a new creature called Gollum that is bound to the ring, and claims he knows the route into Mordor. Is he a friend or foe?it then shifts to Merry and Pippin who are held captive by a band of Uruk-hai. the Uruk-hair get destroyed in a battle against humans, and Merry and Pippin flee into the forest of fangorn. There they meet the most beloved character in The lord of the Rings books, treebeard, a creature that is a walking, talking tree that must gather the other trees for an inevitable battle against Saruman. And lastly, there's Aragorn, and his two friends Gimili, a dwarf, and Legolas, an elf. They follow the Uruk-hai, till the damned creatures meet their miserable fate. The trio encounter a band of human riders from a country called Rohan, which tell them the direction of the uruk slaughter, which leads the trio into Fnagorn forest, where they meet an unexpected friend, and learn that the folk of Rohan are being attacked by Saruman, and must make a stand against an army of 10,000! Can these three gatherers change the fate of middle-earth in the little time they have? Peter Jackson has proved himself of filming great battle sequences, unique special effects, a great storyline of an unforgettable tale, and moral lessons all people must learn. 5/5",10,2,3,6 March 2004
Schindler's List," Captivating!
","Truly, the best movie ever made! I movie that everyone should see if you don't like this movie, you should see a head doctor! it is a fabulous cinematic, that is winner of seven academy awards, including Best picture and director! Warner spoilers! This movie takes place in Germany, in the mid 1930s, before the Jews are being forced into the concentration camps. it is about a German wealthy citizen named Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson), who bribes many German officers to help him with his cause to make money. from all of his bribing, he ends up with a clever Jewish accountant named Stern (Ben Kingsley) who helps start his factory of making pots and pans.The plan succeeds, having over 350 Jewish workers, but suddenly the peace is ruined by a corrupted and ill-minded German officer named Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), who sends his Nazi goons into the ghetto of where Schindler's and countless other Jews are held. This is among the most powerful scenes of where the little girl in the red jacket is witnessed. for more than fifteen agonizing minutes, the Jews are rounded up, taken from their homes, and mercilessly shot, and among the captured is Stern (Ben Kingsley).Oscar witnesses the horrors of the Nazis against the Jews hatred, and feels obligated to save them in any means necessary to rescue as many as he can, not just for money, but for life! Truly, a magnificent and powerful film that reveals our inhumanity to one another and how much evil and hatred consumes this world. it is captivating and powerfully moving. It is among my top five favorites list of films I have seen in my short life. The ending, I guarantee will leave many in tears...",10,9,13,8 May 2005
The Incredibles," The Incredible!!!!
","Personally, I never really liked Walt Disney or Animated films, except Shrek, but, this movie was highly INCREDIBLE!!! What made this animated film so great was not just the graphics but the characters and the storyline. It is a typical action/adventure film, but it is animated. The various abilities of the heroes were fantastic, the humor was unstoppable, including some inaapropiate as I say 'fat jokes', and brief sexual dialogue. But I love this family film, understanding the PG rating though. This movie is better than Nemo, Ice Age, and Monster Inc., but the two Shrek films in my opinion remain the best. this is a great family movie, filled with action, humor, and amazing animation!10 out of 10! it is totally INCREDIBLE!!!!",10,0,1,13 November 2004
The Elephant Man," One of the greatest movies I have ever seen!
","Based on a true story, 'The Elephant Man' is about John Merrick, a man who suffers from a congenital disease. He is so horribly disfigured that the only place he can find a niche is the circus. Despite his condition, a Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) finds and brings him to the hospital of where he's doing research on such unusual diseases. Here, John develops a friendship with Dr. Treves and regains his dignity for being a human. John Hurt as John Merrick a.k.a 'The Elephant Man' gave one of the most memorable performances I have ever seen. I can understand why Robert De Niro won for Raging Bull since he's a more well-known actor than Hurt. But underneath the hours of make up, John Hurt is not a screen robber like De Niro, but plays a troubled and unloved individual who wants to be accepted. His performance in several scenes almost moved me to tears. Anthony Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, and John Gielgud are equally as wonderful as Hurt. Even though this is the only movie I have seen by David Lynch, I was immediately pulled into the film. His direction is simply wonderful, particularly with the limited shots of the Elephant Man. His body was never fully shown, until John Hurt developed the character. Because of this, rather than being frightened by The Elephant Man, I felt sympathy for him. The work of the cinematography by Freddie Francis is marvelous. The black and white not only made the Elephant's Man appearance less disturbing but it also set the tone of the time period during the late nineteenth century. The movie would not even been as good if it wasn't for the black-and-white. In addition, the score by John Morris adds to the gloomy atmosphere of the film. The Elephant Man is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It is sad and depressing, yet it is brilliant and very moving. It makes you cry for John Merrick, not just for pity but for sympathy. It makes you realize that we are all human, despite our disadvantages. It also makes you realize that one man knows that despite his condition, he knows he's all right. It is a shame that this did not get any Academy Awards. 10/10",10,2,2,24 April 2008
I Am Legend," Smith Success!
","I Am Legend kind of has a Cast Away feeling. It is about one man isolated and trying to survive. But the circumstances are different. This time the main character has a small arsenal, a dog Sam to keep him company, mannequins, and an entire city to live in.He spends his days active: exercising, hunting, and seeking for a cure to a disease (which he is immune) that has wiped out and turned most of humanity into zombies. His nights are on the lookout, barricaded and ready for the bloodthirsty monsters.Once again, Will Smith shines as one of Hollywood's most influential actors. He is his usual self, funny, energetic, and overall entertaining. However, his character is not an ordinary protagonist like he was as Jim West in Wild Wild West or Agent Jay in Men in Black. His character is vulnerable and imperfect. He is not a super hero, but an ordinary, everyday person in a nightmarish situation. Of the movies I have seen him in, I have to say this is one of his best. The story is not cheesy; it's rather engaging and sometimes emotional with the well-timed flashbacks.The action sequences were well-done, particularly with the scene in the beginning of where Smith chases after a pack of deer in a fast sports car. The camera angles and the computer-generated deer were amazing. Additional to the action, the movie had several suspenseful moments. There was one scene of where Smith goes into a dark room to find his dog. Each move and turn he makes put me on the edge of my seat, as I wonder what could pop up on the camera and scare me.But unfortunately, my expectation of a quick pace was not as I hoped. The 101 minute movie felt more than two hours long. I also felt that some of the moments of where Will talks to the mannequins to be a little off. Other than that, I really liked this movie. 9/10",9,3,6,23 December 2007
Amadeus," A Marvelous Motion Picture!
","I never knew much about Mozart, just only his music. Despite the inaccuracies I have heard about this movie, it sheds a unique and brilliant light upon the man. Tom Hulce is simply wonderful as Mozart. He's clever, ingenious, funny, eccentric, and even naughty. I'm very surprised that he did not get the Oscar for Best Actor.F Murray Arahams is great in his role as a selfish, envious, competitive, and career driven colleague of Mozart, but I did not find him to be as believable as Hulce. Neither were well-known actors back in Amadeus's release, but it is fair that one of them won. On a side note, I think this movie would not have been good if it had a well-known Hollywood cast.Director Milos Forman, famous for 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', captures the film astonishingly, specifically with the opera sequences that pan back and forth between Mozart conducting and the actors on the stage performing. In addition with the opera sequences, the art direction, costume design, and the work of the cinematography is exquisite to the point that I felt like I was seeing Mozart conducting in the 1700s.This movie has it all. The Man. The Music. The Madness. The Magic. Marvelous! The Oscars were right on what this film earned. 10/10",10,1,2,6 May 2008
Unknown," Despite his age, Neeson still has it in him
","Multiple people have compared this to Neeson's 2008 release of 'Taken.' Both have a similar concept; Liam goes on a fast-paced journey to retrieve something special that has been taken from him. This time it is not his daughter; it is his mind. Unlike 'Taken,' 'Unknown' is more of a suspense mystery than an action flick. There are some chases and fight scenes, but that is not the main focus. The movie's plot is focus and it is unique for it is unpredictable. We are confused like Neeson's character and there are times we don't know if he will succeed. There are multiple twists and unlike most mystery thrillers, it took me more than half through the film to figure it all out. In short, 'Unknown' is a fairly decent mystery thriller. Good performances. Good story for a mystery. Good music. Good cinematographyâ€”I particularly like the whole gray, dreary atmosphere that reflects the film's location's bleak weather. Good twists. Good suspenseâ€” the sound mixers must've had a kick in adding emphasis on sound effects to startle the audience. The one thing I will note is that Liam Neeson is really showing his age. This is not necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary, it helps his character out. It gets tiresome that Hollywood always uses the generic 30-something year old actor with smashing abs who is tossed into a terrible situation. It is nice to see an aging actor play an upper middle-aged man who has perhaps lost his mind while running away from people trying to kill him. My rating: ***/****",8,148,178,1 March 2011
Gran Torino," It goes out with a bang
","I saw this movie on opening day and the theater was packed and loud, but when the movie openedÂ…silence. When the 1 hour and 56 minute film ended, the silence was gone and there was some applause. My point, 'Gran Torino' is a captivating film. It's not the typical shoot 'em up bang 'em up like a lot of Eastwood films, nor is it about emotional intensity (even though there is some of both in the movie).This movie is about a single, aging man, looking out at the world from a cynical viewpoint. He's estranged to his family and can't stand his neighbors who happen to be all Oriental. Yet when a young boy tries to steal his Gran Torino, he develops a unique relationship with him. I know this sound like the previews, but there's much more to it that I won't give away.But I will mention that Clint, who I think can relate a lot to the character he portrays, gives probably his best performance since 'Unforgiven.' I am shocked and disappointed that he didn't receive an Oscar nomination. I was also impressed with the other cast members, particularly with Ahney Her as Sue. She stands as a comic relief in the film as well as someone you would want to befriend. As with Bee Vang as Tao, he's decent, but there are times in the film where he seems to be just reading his lines rather than putting oomph in his character.I also enjoyed the song that Clint wrote and performed at the end of the film 'Gran Torino' which was nominated for a Golden Globe, but is robbed of an Oscar nomination. The other uses in the film such as editing, directing, and music all added substance to the film. And surprisingly for a picture by Clint Eastwood it has a lot of humor (most which is racial), and also some sad parts to it. If it's true that this is the last film Clint will star in, then he made an excellent farewell with a bang. My rating: ***1/2 out of ****",9,3,7,28 January 2009
Hero," Gorgeous artwork with a provocative storyline
","Most Asian films are done with all visuals and artwork, which in a sense can tell a story. But what makes this film so amazing is the fact that not only does it tell the story through mere imagery, but it also tells it to you with a solid plot and dialog. It took me several times to see this movie over a few years period to fully understand it. And now with a conclusion to my mind about it, the film is fascinating with its two main aspects: film-making and storyline.The Film-making: It holds a beautiful and haunting film-making quality that ties with the prior 'Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.' Whether it was from the top-notched action sequences, such as 'the duel in the autumn leaves', holding strong symbolisms of blood, death, and downfall, which is expressed through the various shades of vermilion, scarlet, and crimson and 'the fight on the turquoise lake', which shows the emotions of hate, love, mercy, and grief. Additional to the phenomenal action sequences, the set-production and costume design was amazing to look at, giving me memories of the artworks of the late Akira Kurosawa. Director Yimou Zhang is simply brilliant with oriental artwork.The storyline: Instead of having a story of a handful of warriors who fight against a tyrant, which the previews led to believe, it is about how a few individuals can change the heart of one man who can change a blood spilled country into a solid nation, rather than the suffer the brutal chaos of an all-out war. In a way, the film can be viewed as either an anti-war propaganda, or even a bit on the idealistic factor. But nonetheless, the moral of peace over violence creates a better world.**** out of ****",10,1,2,9 May 2007
Shrek the Third," Not in measure of the first two, but still fun...
","Like millions of other viewers, I absolutely loved the first two Shrek films. With the magic that the first two films held, I dearly wanted to see the third one despite the negative reviews I have read about it. And after seeing it, I don't necessarily agree with the 'bashing reviews', nor do I call this Shrek in measure of the first two films.Story wise it doesn't too bad. It didn't have a strong storyline as did the first two, but it was no disappointment. In fact, I found it quite humorous like the previous films. It basically picks up from the second film, of where King Harold the Frog of Far Far Away dies, and Shrek is the next in line for being king. Once again, Shrek is in a situation he doesn't want to be part of, and the only alternative of him not being king is to find the other heir in line, Arthur or 'Artie'. As this happens, Prince Charming decides to make a 'happily after' for himself and the other unhappily after characters by invading Far Far Away.Yet again, the unforgettable characters such as: Donkey, Puss n Boots, Fiona, Shrek, and many other protagonist characters flourish on the big screen, which was very pleasing. There are also a couple of new faces, including Merlin and Arthur. The voice of Merlin by Eric Idle was simply comic genius, giving me memories of his Monty Python humor (which was quite a bit in the film). But the voice of Arthur or Artie by Justin Timberlake was feeble. I'm not a fan of his, and to be brutally honest, his voice is not meant to be in an animated film like Shrek. It just wasn't animated or humorous like the works of the other cast, including: Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphy, or even Antonio Banderas.The other problem I had with this film was that it wasn't as comical as the first two. It didn't have the ridiculous sight gags or fantasy satire like the previous two. And even worse, there was some humor in it that I found very inappropriate for a PG film, including many sexual innuendos and other related things. When I was in the theater loaded with children, I didn't hear a lot of laughter from them.Instead, they began talking through the film out of boredom. Bottom line, it was fun, but not in measure of the first two films. 7/10 Note to Parents: This may not be a movie for your kids if they are under the ages of eight. I suggest you see this movie ahead of time, and see if you think it is appropriate for them.",6,0,1,2 June 2007
The Hurt Locker," A taste of modern-day Iraq through the eyes of our soldiers
","'The Hurt Locker' has been one of the hardest movies for me to find. It didn't come out to any theaters in my area. Now that it has been nominated for three golden globes, and has received mostly positive reviews, I just had to see it. I finally watched it today, online, and I have to say it was no disappointment. I really didn't know what to expect from this movie and I'll not that it isn't the typical war movie that's either pro-war or anti-war, nor is it about honor, duty, respect, or isolation and madness. To sum up 'The Hurt Locker', it is about the modern-day life in Iraq, shown through the eyes of three members of an EOD team. They are put to the test as they spend the remaining 38 days of their 'rotation' together as they encounter some impossible odds and try not to lose it both from the horrors of war and the tension between each other. I did not recognize many of the actors, which seems fitting, because if an actor like Mel Gibson or Nicholas Cage starred in it, I would expect a full-blown action flick. 'The Hurt Locker' is not an action movie, but a drama thriller. The film felt more real because of this. Each actor did an impressive job in their roles, never overacting or just blandly reading the script. Jeremy Renner as SSgt. Will James may portray the typical war hero, cocky, hotheaded, and reckless, but even so, his character is not perfect, and as his service in Iraq continues, he becomes vulnerableÂ…realizing he is just a man. Renner displays this wonderfully. I'm surprised he didn't get a golden globe nom. In addition to the performances, Barry Ackroyd's cinematography is sweeping. He makes the movie in such a way that it almost feels like a documentary made by someone who was actually there. This includes a little bit of the 'shaky camera syndrome', quick zoom ins and outs, and occasional focus issues. This may seem like sloppy camera work, but it is intentional, and it helps put the viewer right in the center of Baghdad. I also give kudos for the film editor and sound designers who add in helping make such an intense and realistic film. On top of that, the music, which is seldom, helps out in adding suspense, and is never overdone. Regarding director Kathryn Bigelow, I've not seen much of her work, but she has talent and balls (specifically for the fact that this movie was shot in Jordan, just miles from Iraq) for making such an intense, suspenseful, and gripping war film that is not preachy nor is about a moral lesson. She shows the war as it is in Iraq, which includes the chaos of gun battles, the paranoia and racial tensions between the U.S. soldiers and the innocent Iraqi civilians. Though I thoroughly enjoy 'The Hurt Locker', I have to say that it has become a common trend that some director has to do a film about the war in Iraq every single year such as: 'Jarhead', 'In the valley of Elah', and 'Stoploss' to name a few. This movie really isn't anything new. I will honestly not remember this movie for years to come like 'Avatar' or even 'Inglourious Basterds'. But because this film is so well done in acting, film-making, and pace, I won't damage it's score. 4/4",9,5,15,21 December 2009
Meet Joe Black," A good movie, but did it have to be 3 hours long?
","I've seen this movie a couple of times on television, but only bits of pieces of it. Now after finally getting a chance to see it all the way through, and at my own pace, I have to say this is a good movie. I liked all the actors performances, each of them add diligence to their characters. Even though Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt were the leads, I felt Jeffrey Tambor and Claire Forlani did the best jobs as the comical Quince and attractive Susan.The story maybe a little unrealistic (since it is about the Angel of Death wanting to be a human), but it has some moral lessons, such as enjoying life to the fullest, because it is too short. Thomas Newman's score sustains much of the mood and somewhat mystical feeling to the film. But the problem with this film is the length. Three hours. Sure, there's a plot going on, but does it really need 3 hours to develop? A bit too long for my taste. 7/10",7,1,3,7 September 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Impeccable acting with flawless film-making quality...
","Most of the movies I have seen, I can sum them up in a few words. 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is one of those couple of films that I can't explain real well. If any word can define it, I would use the word unique, for everything in this movie is. Plot wise, the film is a romance story, similar to 'Titanic' in the aspect that it is told through flashback from a dying old lady named Daisy (Cate Blanchett wonderfully disguised in make up and with a fluent Southern accent) to her daughter (Julia Ormond) about her long lost love. Even though she tells the story, Brad Pitt narrates it and like Cate, he has a fluent Southern accent that he pulls off magnificently. I won't bother in giving the rest of the story since the movie trailers nail it down very well, but that doesn't give it the excuse not see it.When I think the movie would end, it continues. This is not necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary it makes the movie unique. For a film that is almost three hours long, I was engulfed by it from start to finish. I will admit though there were times when I had to adjust my seating position.Most of the romance films I have seen are great because of the chemistry between the male and female roles. This movie definitely has that, particularly on Brad Pitt's side. I'm not a huge Brad fan but I loved his powerful work in this film. People have criticized his character as a protagonist who doesn't do much and lets things pass him by rather than taking advantage of the moment, particularly in a scene where he has a chance to sweep Daisy off her feet but fails to do it.I personally liked this about his character. He's a different kind of protagonist; he's passive, shy, yet humble and nice, often not sure how to react in certain situations when things are at stake. To me, that makes him all the more believable. What's also nice about this film is that Brad and Cate don't steal the show like Gosling and McAdams did in 'The Notebook.' For a long movie, it's not all about them, there's breathing room for other characters to develop and enter the lives of the two leading roles. All of the actors, even Julia Ormond, who's only in the film for maybe fifteen minutes, add diligence to their performances. Besides the acting, the technical aspects of the film were amazing. It was well photographed, edited, scored, and directed. The one thing I couldn't help but notice though in this film was that often, in wide shots of objects, such as people would be blurred like a 1920s/1930s movie. I don't know if this was the cinematographer's/director's intention or if this was the fault of the film projection at the theater I was in. In any case, this added an authenticity to the time period that film took place in. David Fincher, (who I can't help but admire his work for 'Fight Club') was the perfect choice for this film as the director. He uses so many different techniques that capture the film amazingly. I was particularly captivated by the long tracking shot he uses in a scene where a WWI battle unfolds. It is captivating to watch, especially when it all happens backwards, literally. I also enjoyed the visual effects used in the film. It may seem that there aren't many, but believe me, there is and they are all subtle, like in 'Forrest Gump'. They are there but you can't notice them because they're that good. There is also some excellent costume and set- designs throughout the film, adding more to the authenticity of the time period, and the make up design, a definite Oscar there. It not only transformed Pitt and Blanchett into old people, but it made them become their characters. I have not seen such good make up since 'The Elephant Man.'Despite the amazing acting and flawless film-making quality, I felt the story could have been much more. It was interesting that Benjamin was raised by a black family, (who ran an old folks home), yet there was no racism. In addition, when Ben was a kid, there was never a scene in which he tried to befriend other boys, just Daisy when he was eleven (even though an old man). I also did not understand some of the symbolism that was used throughout the film. Overall, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is a unique, yet marvelous film that is a definite contender for the Oscars coming up in February. I don't give too many 10s, so I give this 9.",9,0,1,17 January 2009
Transformers," An action spectacle well worth the admission ticket price!
","Transformers were one of my favorite action figures I played with when I was a kid. As being much older now, I would never had expected Hollywood to make a movie based off of them and if they did, I had the strong sense that it would flop. But now I have seen it, and my judgments were proved totally wrong.First off, I have to say that 'Transformers' has the best; I repeat the BEST visual effects ever created, towering over 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. The visuals were so authentic and awesome that they did not even look like computer-generated robots, but real ones. In the theater, I felt right in the movie with the robots as they fought each other against impossible odds.Now, most movies with great action sequences and spectacular special effects seem to focus just on those two things and forget the actors and script. Unlike those kinds of movies, 'Transformers' has a decent list of cast members from the significant roles of: Shia LeBeouf, John Duhammel, and Rachel Taylor to the smaller roles, including: John Voight, Bernie Mac, and John Turturro. Of those thespians, I have seen Shia LeBeouf in the fewest of movies. However, he was a great lead, especially for an action flick like 'Transformers'.The story was very unrealistic, as expected, but it was interesting. Although, it did not have a corny feeling of heroism and emotional effect like 'Spider-man' or 'Fantastic Four' has; it did not feel like a 'comic book based' movie. On the contrary, I was interested in the story, and it had a hint of emotion for the 'good guy' robots. But it does not have a strong moral tale like 'Batman Begins'. Overall, I was highly impressed with this movie. There is no doubt that this should win Best Visual Effects in the Oscars! 9/10 -This is not quite a kid's movie, due in part to the hearty and sometimes adult/sexual jokes.",9,1,4,7 July 2007
Lincoln," Thank you Mr. Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis for making this movie.
","From what we know about Abraham Lincoln, he had a very hard life marked by tragedyâ€”his immediate family died when he was a child, and two of his own sons lost their lives at very young ages. Despite his hardships, he was a brilliant man when it came to law and politics. For his four years as president, he saved the United States from complete obliteration and he altered history by opening better opportunities for African Americans. He had accomplished much in his life, and to do a film on such a man would be both an incredible and a challenging feat. I do not lack any confidence in director Steven Spielberg. He has done many masterpieces and very few failures. Walking into the theater, I did not know which avenue Spielberg was going to take with this film. Trying to cram the entire life of Lincoln in 2 hours and 30 minutes would be impossible. So would focusing on all of his four years in office. Fortunately, Spielberg and his team zero in on the last four months of Lincoln's presidency. With a comprehensive and focused plot, the movie gets a chance to explore the White House war room, political negotiations, Lincoln's family, and the issue of trying to pass the 13th Amendment within the House of Representatives. The movie comes off as a political dramaâ€” not an action flick, which is a good thing for Lincoln never saw the actual battles, only the bloody aftermaths. The film also truly shows the mindset of the North against blacks. Just like in the South, there were bigots who opposed the idea of freeing blacks and giving them the right to vote, as well as abolitionists who only wanted the amendment to pass as a means to cripple the South's manual labor source of slavery. Unfortunately, the film romanticizes Lincoln's true views on the subject. He is depicted as a man who wants equality for all. This is far from fact. Hollywood is a master of fiction, and this is appropriate for Lincoln in this movie. Who would want to see Abraham Lincoln as a racist on the big screen?In regards to Daniel Day-Lewis's performance as Lincoln, it is easily the best of the year (thus far). It is hard to say that this is Lewis's best role, because every performance he delivers seems to be his best. What is particularly unique about this portrayal is that Lewis is subtler and more relaxed with a calm confidence. He gives us a down-to-earth, gentle spirited, and soft-spoken individual that is simple for us to admire. The assistance of great make up design helps him look like old Abe, but in all honesty, I think without it, he could still embody the soul and heart of the man. I vote for Lewis to win his 3rd academy award for this flawless portrayal of Abraham Lincoln.Lewis is not alone in great performances. Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Jared Harris, and Hal Holbrook (to a name few) make a standout cast, each adding diligence to their respective roles. Tommy Lee Jones specifically warrants attention for another Oscar nomination as Thaddeus Stevens. His tough, no-nonsense, and deadpan delivery of lines suits him perfectly. Like all of his films, Spielberg gives us a technically sound piece of work. John Williams score is gentle, often creating a mood that relates to what is happening on the screen. Janusz Kaminski's use of imitating natural light delivers a beautiful and old-fashioned looking film. The production design, costumes, editing, and even sound mixing meshes together in a solid mix of perfection. What I like most about this movie is how it sheds light on an important part of history while keeping our attention and interest without an ounce of it getting dull or pretentious. In all honesty, 'Lincoln' is Spielberg's best movie since 'Munich.' With a great cast, great production values, great plot, and great pacing, I cannot complain about this movie at all. 10/10",10,4,10,21 November 2012
Children of Men," Dark, depressing, and disconnecting...there's no soul!
","I was really, really looking forward to this film. It looked like the next, modern-day Blade runner, loaded with a combination of action and story, at least that's what the trailers looked like. But unfortunately, it was major disappointment. To put the film in simpler terms, instead of focusing on the story, in which the trailers showed was about an ordinary man named Theodore Faron (Clive Owen) who accompanies Juliane Taylor (Julianne Moore) to relocate a pregnant woman that can save humanity from self-destruction.No, this is not the case with this film, instead, Leftims propaganda is rubbed in your face. It's no surprise that the Leftist sympathizing critics loved it; it had all the things they fantasize about or dread: - Fascist Totalitarian State - Lynch mob in the form of the all male, all white state police - CoOp Farms are safe, Capitalistic cities are dangerous -white rich people who have mindless and spoiled children - Discrediting of the Christian religion/bloodthirsty Muslims- Celebrity worship - Concentration camps - Deportations - Beirut/Baghdad style street fighting - Crooked cops smuggling drugs and people into Prisons - State torture of political activists - massacres of innocent civilians See what I mean? Even more so, the depiction of the world that Alfonso Cuaron created gave me memories of what eastern Europe became after the Berlin Wall fell. This includes: pollution, trash every way, and everything/everyone is filthy.So, the story was left to rot, leaving plenty of plot holes and unclear explanations. The film did not get involved in any of characters nor grew in deep with the story, as to how the world ended up in the way it is. Instead of developing characters, they were killed off almost as badly as Scorsese's 'The Departed', but much, much quicker. So, there is no real feelings for these characters as they face either their demise or success in this 'screwed up' world, nor are their motivations and inner struggles revealed.The three good cast members: Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Michale Caine were great, but were only in the film for a limited time. No chemistry was built up in the characters they played. Even Michael Caine, who was strangely dressed up as a 'crazy hippie' was deeply limited, as was the lovely Julianne Moore (who was only in the film for ten minutes). The rest of the cast was incompetent for the film (if you call it a film). They're acting was weak and at most wooden. Particularly the actress who played Kee. All she did was whine, complain, and hide behind people's back as they were blown to pieces by lead (which happened frequently).Bottom line, this film had no soul; there was no flow to it (just propaganda); the trailers were very misleading. Instead of a combo of action and story, the film delivers depression, darkness, and disconnections in a leftist dystopia. What was worse was, that the camera was 'hand held'. There's no big deal with that, but when the camera shakes violently as if it was near the tremors of an earthquake, it gives a very out of control and unclear view as to what was happening. I felt like I was watching a B movie, like Mad Max. And not to mention the action sequences (which were few), were like this, and I was forced to look away, because I had such a headache! So my point of view, do not see this film, unless you're a Leftist or believed in Leftism.A generous 1/4 if you do see this movie, take some anti-nausea pills, for there are guarantees, you may get motion sickness.",3,5,12,18 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," No female rocky!
","Truly, one of the best films of the year of 2004 and one of Eastwood's best! I had an impression this would be just a female rocky, but I assure you, it is not. Hilary Swank won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance and Eastwood got well earned Oscars for director and picture. The acting, especially Hilary Swank is superb, including Freeman, who is in supporting this time (who also won). The music was haunting but great, there's offbeat humor, and some of the most important lessons everyone should learn. The only probably with this movie was the last thirty minutes of the film. I don't want to spoil the ending, but it seems to drag on and on. My overall rating: 9 out of 10.",10,4,6,19 May 2008
Dumb and Dumber," The Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels Show
","Dumb and Dumber is pretty much about two idiots who do stupid things every day. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are perfect in their roles as Floyd and Harry. Both are obnoxious and crude, but they are also unique in the different types of humor they deliver. Jim Carrey, as in all of his movies, is the energizer bunny of weird noises and facial expressions. Jeff Daniels is the one who delivers the hysterical sight gags and one-liners.This is definitely not a comedy for everyone. Many people call this movie stupid. It is stupid. But it is so stupid that it is funny like The Simpsons. I have to admit though that nothing can beat the comic genius of The Simpsons. However, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are the comic masters of Dumb and Dumber. No one else could make the characters they built. 7/10",7,1,3,28 March 2008
The Imitation Game," An exceptional film
","'The Imitation Game' is a movie that makes known a part of classified history during World War II and it shows that even then, people 70 years ago were thinking ahead on how technology can impact and eventually alter how wars can be fought. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician who has a mind for the future. At the peak of the Blitz, the British government recruits him to crack the Enigmaâ€”a type of code that the Germans used to communicate their naval positions. Discovering that it is humanly impossible to decipher the code, he brainstorms the idea to build a machine that could break the Enigma and save lives. To put it quite plainly, Alan Turing is the man who founded the first computer. His journey of working with a team to build this game-changing device is only part of the film. The movie also explores the man and his personal struggles of being a homosexual in a society that outlaws such 'behavior.' This subject matter is handled with tact and is never in the viewer's face in regards to say, showing sexual situations. With Cumberbatch's pro-gay advocacy and him personally seeing Alan Turing as an idol no doubt made him the perfect candidate for the role. Putting aside all of these matters, there is no other British actor who could portray this man and his struggles. Interestingly, the film depicts Turing as a bit of a recluse and exhibiting Asperger's tendenciesâ€”he says things bluntly and has no social graces whatsoever. He fires two employees out of merely 'slowing everyone else down' and he does not understand or bear the time for diplomatic solutions for his fellow code-breakers. At first blush, he can be quickly seen as an egotistical jerk. While the film progresses though, we clearly can comprehend his problems, accept his brilliance, and even feel empathy for him as a human being. Cumberbatch has given us a complicated, multi-layered, yet honorable performance. Graham Moore's witty dialog has supplied Ben with plenty of ammunition for his character as well as add flare for both funny and serious moments. Moore makes a front-runner for the Adapted Screenplay category. The remaining actors in the film are merely good and never reach Cumberbatch's level. Keira Knightley though does have some great moments, particularly in a scene where she tries to help a depressed Alan back on his feet again. 'The Imitation Game' is an exceptional film. It has a stellar performance by the lead actor. It is well rounded and explains character and plot in past, present, and future settings. It is supported with an emotionally charged score by Alexandre Desplat and has beautiful set pieces from the production design team. The ending is a little fast, but suitable. It is not a pure Oscar bait film. It is really an award-worthy one.",10,4,11,25 January 2015
The Piano," Brilliant film-making and top-notched performances, but too much sex.
","'The Piano' is a love story set in the 1850s. A mute pianist Ada (Holly Hunter) has been arranged to marry Alisdair Stewart (Sam Neill). With her daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) and her piano they travel to New Zealand. Shortly after they arrive, Stewart sells her piano to his neighbor George Baines (Harvey Keitel). Tormented with grief over the loss of her piano, she would do anything to get it back. She soon learns that she can get back from Baines through lessons that have some unpleasant attachments to it. After much gross sexual conduct, he gives it back to her, but inevitably, Ada falls in love with him, which sets them up with emotional and sometimes violent consequences.'The Piano' is a very well-made film. Director Jane Campion captures every scene with great care. The work of the photography and music is captivating, blending the film into a beautiful, yet creepy artistic value.As with the performances, they are some of the best I've seen. Holly Hunter is very unique in her role. Unlike some other great actresses who rely on bold speeches to give them Oscars, she relies on her face that expresses so many emotions that it's almost heartbreaking to watch due to all the torture and hell her character goes through. Anna Paquin, who I know most for Rogue in the X-Men Trilogy, is young, cute, and adorable as Flora, however, she adds power and a little bit of humor that goes a long way for an actress at her age. Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel also add some diligence to their roles.But the reason why I give this movie a 7 instead of a 10 is because of the subject matter. I felt antagonized by the explicit scenes of gross sexuality and related material. Of course, I have no problem with nudity, but not the sexual fantasies of Harvey Keitel's character.",7,0,6,7 September 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," From Spaghetti Western to Old Japanese films to Matrix visual effects equals a cool, bloody, action-packed movie!
","Warning!!! Spoilers!!!As the title reads, it truly tells the whole guidelines of the film. This film is a cross mix between Segio Leone's spaghetti westerns and Akira Kurosawa's old samurai films, and Matrix visual effects are added. Uhm...interesting. Well, here's what I have to say. This is truly one of the best action flicks that I have witnessed. This film may be filled with excessive blood and gore, that is quite unrealistic, but it is a impressive piece of work. This is the first Quentin Tarantino film I have seen, and i love it! The film starts off black-and-white, with a blood soaked bride who begs not to be killed, but is shot in the head anyway. Four years pass, and she's in a hospital, awaking after a gunshot wound to the head. (This film is totally out of order, like Pulp Fiction but this is how it should be in order). She gathers herself together to realize what has happened and escapes the hospital. Meanwhile, after escaping th hospital, and now fully gathered herself together,r she has a quest of vengeance to kill a list of people who have slaughtered her wedding. One by one, she picks them off with her special fencing and karate abilities, making unbelievable action sequences, comical, and intense. The story unfolds from hear on, her quest of revenge, only armed with a sword that speaks for her violent temper! Quentin Tarantino is a fabulous director. he knows his humor, his drama, and blood-soaking action/violence, and unexpected twists. Truly, Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors ever! Uma Thurman is totally an outstanding actress! My overall rating, a definite 10 out of 10!",10,6,12,14 March 2005
Clash of the Titans," Release the CGI, because that's all there is!
","Years ago, I took a mythology class. We went over in-depth the different gods, goddesses, and heroes. I have probably heard of all the Greek mythical tales, but not of Perseus. I was thinking this would be a treat, as I am a lover of mythology, but the negative reviews pushed me away from seeing it on the big screen. I found it online. I'll be honest, I'm glad I did not spend seven dollars or more to see it.This movie has run into the same issue as many Hollywood films do, effects over story. I should take it for a grain salt, since I had no idea what the myth is about, but even in the story itself, there were little plot holes that just made me chuckle. I won't bother even mentioning them, for I could write a several-paged essay on them. The other let down was the acting. Thoroughly impressed by Sam Worthington's role in Avatar, I thought he would be a good lead. But in this he was dry, uneventful, and even at a point of where he was supposed to express great emotion, I found myself laughing instead of being moved.The only actors who seemed to have fun with this movie were Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades. Yet still, Neeson was dry and Fiennes, who pulls off an eerie, raspy voice is almost unintelligent in his dialog. On top of that, the 96 minute film also felt slow. But the one thing the filmmakers put their moneys worth, was in the effects. The ten-minute sequence involving the Kraken is shear brilliance, and so are the other creatures in the film. I will note that the encounter with Medusa was not as creepy as I later saw in the 1981 version of 'Clash of the Titans.' Yes to effects, no to substance. I was at least entertained for the time I devoted to this film, but memorable, not really.**/****",3,1,1,26 May 2010
Black Hawk Down," Visually gripping...it will leave you thinking about it
","Years ago, I read Mark Bowden's novel Black Hawk Down. I found it engaging, powerful, and emotional. What made the novel such a successful was how well the author described the perspectives of the men who fought that long day battle in Somalia. Though it is usually unfair to compare the book to the movie (since the book is generally better), the film Black Hawk Down is a visually gripping adaptation. Like the novel, the sum of movie's story is about how things go to hell in a handbag. This film is unlike most other war pictures. There is no hidden, anti-war propaganda like in Platoon. Nor is it even about heroism like Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Instead it is about trying to survive from the gates of hell, and working as a team to do so. It is 1993. The Somali leader at the time holds an iron fist over his people. 123 soldiers are sent to capture a warlord and his lieutenants. The operation is supposed to take no more than an hour. The mission immediately goes wrong when one of the soldiers falls from one of the helicopters. Medics rush in to take the injured soldier out of action. As this happens, the entire city turns on the US ground troops. Within less than an hour of fighting, two helicopters are shot down. It then becomes a game as to which platoon of soldiers can reach the crashed choppers and rescue any potential survivors. The phrase 'No man left behind' took on a new meaning for me as more and more soldiers attempt to rescue these survivors as well as the dead at the expense of their own lives. In the end, the 19 American soldiers are dead and another 70 are wounded.Like the novel, the movie has the tendency of jumping around a bit, from one character to the next. This is intentional, for as the battle gets worse, the divisions of soldiers become separated and lost within a sea of hostiles. This puts our confusion with the characters. We feel for them for we don't know what's going to happen next. Most of the time, we do not even know where they are within the city. The lack of radios and walkie talkies make it harder for the soldiers to communicate with another and the limited gear, such as no night vision goggles, body armor, or canteens, makes it all the worse. Cinematographer Slawomir Idziak gives us the grittiness of the situation. The use of the hand-held camera makes you feel as if you are right with the soldiers as bullets and RPGS whiz by. The various color filters used throughout the movie reiterates the grim and sad experience of death and destruction. For instance, the opening sequence of the dead and dying Somalis has a tungsten (blue) setting. This is an unusual filter to use for a desert location. It would seem more suitable to use bright, highly saturated colors. However, the use of the bluish tint creates a very forlorn, almost dreamlike experience. The green tint that is used during the night fighting in Mogadishu is not only reminiscent to night vision goggles, but it also creates a chilling feeling as the American soldiers desperately fight to survive. The sound design puts a heavy emphasis on the gunshots and explosions. When an RPG is fired, you know when it is time to duck. The movie does not shy away from bloodshed either. Though not nearly as bad as Saving Private Ryan there are many grisly images. One that still sticks to my mind is when a soldier is blown in half by a RPG. Worse, the man is still alive when he shouldn't be. This was vividly described in the novel and it is more alarming to see on a TV screen. Scenes like these are not meant to make us feel nauseated, but rather it depicts the inhumanity of war. It is an emotionally draining experience as we watch such brutality. The final shot of the film shows all the caskets of the soldiers who lost their lives. This poses an important question to the audience. Why? Why did this happen? Why didn't the strategists plan for such an ambush? Why were we in Somali in the first place? By the end of the film, you cannot help but think of the lunacy as to why all these men were maimed and killed.",10,2,3,19 January 2012
Prisoners," Not a fun movie to watch yet a very good one...
","Prisoners is not the average thriller that some reviews and most previews build it up to be. Rather, this feature is a dramatic exploration of the darker side and evilness of humanity. Set in suburbia Kentucky, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a devote family man and Christian, faces a parent's worst nightmare. His daughter goes missing. A young detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned the case, which quickly becomes nearly unsolvable as the only suspect; a RV driver with an IQ of a 10 year-old (Paul Dano) is dismissed from lack of evidence. Keller takes matters into his own hands while the small town gradually begins to fall apart and the most disturbing of secrets from behind closed doors are unveiled. I cannot say that this is a film I enjoyed. It really is not one too enjoy. It is dark and violent, but not violent in the gory senseâ€”in the realistic and psychologically one. We first hand get to see helplessly in how Keller progressively loses his soul and sanity as he continually tortures a man to desperately find any information on his missing little girl. As onlookers, we get to observe how the Dover family slips into a deep depressive state. We watch as the young cop becomes more and more flustered, agitated, and violent as he tries to close a case that he cannot fathom. Director Denis Villeneuve knows how to make the audience feel uncomfortable from depicting a mature subject matter so well and with using such a great cast. Each performance by the actors is raw and real. Hugh Jackman fits the persona of an enraged father pushed beyond his limit. We understand his motives and can accept, but not necessarily condone his brutal actions. Jake Gyllenhaal creates an interesting character that we too can feel and comprehend. He is so natural in the role. It almost seems that he is just the character and not even acting. Paul Dano plays the simpleton well, and he manages to squeeze in his trademark of embodying a whimpering wimp. None of the characters are inherently good or bad nor are they cut as black and white. They are submerged in a vat of grayness and ambivalence.Cinematographer Roger Deakins helps capture the bleak and dejecting atmosphere of the filmâ€”bland, washed out colors in the day and eerie, nightmarish shadows in the night. Shot on a digital camera, the visuals are simply breathtaking. I honestly don't think this movie would have been as impactful if it had been shot on the standard 35mm film. Though sparse, the music supports the dark, foreboding mood. While the film has sublime performances and a great visual style, it falls flat on bits regarding the story. Some subplots are not finished, forcing the viewer to try and connect the dots in a somewhat intricate story. Other elements feel drawn out unnecessarily to the point of boredom. The constant transitions of fading to black during the final act comes off as a gimmick and removes any potential for suspense or energy. The ending particularly leaves the viewer cold and without solace. Then again, as previously stated, this movie is not your traditional thriller. It focuses on drama versus thrills and chills, which supports the blah atmosphere. A little of excitement though could go a long way in spicing things up for the film's concluding act. Prisoners is a film that is not fun to watch, but it is a very good one. The two and half-hour length is not something to be disheartened over. In fact, more could have been added to complete the plot in its entirety.",8,1,2,22 February 2014
Silence," A powerful meditation on faith and the human spirit
","The year is 1640. The Catholic Church has spread all over the world, yet one nation has been labeled a danger. That is Japan. Two Jesuit Priests, Father Rodriguez (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (Adam Driver) receive word that their former master Ferrerira (Liam Neeson) has apostatized. Believing this a lie, the two priests embark on a journey to the foreign land, hoping to discover the truth of their teacher. The Priests' quest proves more burdensome than they had expected, putting their lives in danger and faith to the test.Dubbed as his passion project, Scorsese explores many deep, philosophical questions in Silence. Is there a God? If so, why does he permit so much suffering? Is it mere arrogance and selfishness to hold onto one's faith at the expense of other people's lives? There is much to meditate and reflect upon in this film. At times, Silence is very hard to watch. While not particularly bloody, unlike some of Scorsese's other movies, the brutal acts depicted feel very real.Aside from the controversial subject matter, 'Silence' is an excellent character study on Father Rodriguez and Garupe. We get to see how they change and ultimately follow two different paths. Andrew Garfield turns in his best work as Father Rodriguez. Adam Driver is equally brilliant. Liam Neeson has minimal screen time, but delivers one of his finest performances. He can convey so much emotion without speaking. There is more to his acting capability than Bryan Mills from Taken. Isse Ogata is evil and manipulative as the Japanese Inquisitor. He can be charming one moment and vile the next, a sort of Doctor Jekyll/Mr. Hyde persona. The rest of the supporting cast are also great in their respective roles.Like most other movies by Scorsese, the production values are top-notched. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is simply stunning. Each shot is a work of exceptional art, whether it is a close-up on an actor's face or a beautiful landscape image. Prieto has a phenomenal eye for composition and lighting, proving himself as one of Hollywood's best DP's. The production and costume designs are exquisite, capturing a lost era. The make-up design accommodates the ugliness and lack of personal hygiene people had centuries ago. We don't see actors with pearly white teeth or unblemished skin. The use of sound or rather lack thereof is particularly unique. There are moments where it is completely silent. The visuals take priority, allowing the audience a chance to absorb the character's emotions. This technique works very well. The fact Silence does not have a music soundtrack makes it even powerful. So many films rely on music to convey an emotional response in the viewer. The visuals, performances, and story do this for the movie. The only criticism I have is the pace. The first two hours move steadily but the ending drags a bit. It is almost as if the screenwriters wanted to add more to the story than it needed. In my opinion, a shorter ending would have given the film a much stronger resolution. With such a huge filmmaking career that Scorsese has developed over the years, it is hard for me to rank this as one of his best. He has made so many excellent movies. Silence is a great one. That's for sure â€“ one of 2016's best.",9,5,11,21 January 2017
The Dark Knight," Dark. Gripping. Emotional. Thrilling. Action-packed. Ledger. Bale. Everything needed for a superhero feat!
","Rarely have I seen a sequel that is as good as or even better than the original one. 'The Dark Knight' is a complete draw with 'Batman Begins' as the best superhero film ever made. Unlike many other sequels, this Batman has a unique story of its own with great, intense action sequences, some philosophy, and an unforgettable villain.Easily, 'The Joker' is the performance of Heath Ledger's life. He does not copycat off of Nicholson who was more humorous than anything. Ledger as The Joker, although having a wicked sense of humor, is more of a believable villain. He makes up all the ingredients as a sinister, cunning, and even psychotic antagonist. I did not recognize him at all in the role. Even his voice is unrecognizable. He is The Joker. I would not be surprised if he gets an Oscar nomination for his performance.Once again, Christian Bale is in the seat as Batman and is great at it. I found his character in this movie to be more ambivalent like Tobey Maguire was for Spider-man 2. The hero is drawn between whether he should continue his mantle as Gotham's hero, or let the law to take control with the new D.A. Harvey Dent.Aaron Eckhart, to my surprise, was excellent as Dent, who later becomes Two-Face. Like Bale, he demonstrates a character that has an internal struggle on what is right and what is wrong. In the end, it leads to tragedy.As with the plot, it circles around the original theme of good vs. evil. However, as good as a hero maybe, evil has a way of breaching walls and making the hero vulnerable which this movie demonstrates clearly with an unexpected death of a main character. As Michael Caine says in the movie, 'Some people just like to see the world burn.' Nonetheless, there's a bit of hope, as Eckhart says, 'We are in the darkÂ…but the dawn is coming.' These simple lessons add much to the uniqueness of the film.'The Dark Knight' is a dark movie more so than 'Batman Begins'. The behavior of the villains are ruthless and the violence at times is intense, but it is not overdone enough to be an R rating. For action lovers and Batman fans, this is the sequel you've been waiting for! There's plenty of hype to it! 10/10",10,4,9,19 July 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Don't get it; don't care for it...an ultimate waste of time
","I honestly don't get what is so great about this movie. Sure, it covers controversial topics like evolution and A.I., but it is all done through images rather than dialog. Many people that I know like this film from that very reason; well, no offense, but when I see a movie, I look forward to actors acting, and a clear storyline.Visuals are great to have, which this movie certainly fulfills, but it is not enough. All it took was classical music and a green screen to make this movie. I can understand it was a big deal in the 1960s but come on; any fool can do that. This is all I got out after seeing this movie: -The first five minutes are of blackness with blaring classical music. The next twenty minutes of the movie is nothing more than apes jumping around and using bones to beat one another senselessly.-When this FINALLY ends, the next five minutes is a distant shot of a modeled space station that the camera zooms incredibly slowly towards it with some pretty music. After this, there are actually PEOPLE in this movie. WowÃ‚â€¦it only took a half hour to see some people! -So these people are on some sort of mission, which makes up the next thirty minutes of nothing more than boring dialog (at least there was some talking). Then all of the sudden, they all die for no reason. The next hour of the film is the introduction of the ACTUAL story with the protagonist Dave and the computer A.I. Hal. Predictably, Hal malfunctions and decides to kill everyone, forcing Dave to be the hero.-Now that two hours have passed, I sleepily wonder what the rest of the film is. Well, I'll just say that the next ten minutes is what John Candy quoted from Spaceballs, 'They have gone to plad.' Following that, the remainder of the movie is an old man in robes eating at a table in a white room muttering to himself, and then a swift change to an alien baby sucking its thumb.I did not get a single point from this movie, just a borefest of pretty images that I can find in any Terrence Malick film. There was nothing captivating or enchanting with this movie. I wish I could get the two and a half hours I lost from watching this waste of a so-called 'classic science-fiction film'. 1/10 -If I was able to, I would give this a fat zero.",8,11,29,11 November 2007
Blood Diamond," Powerful in every way
","I have to admit that I am a natural fan of Edward Zwick, particularly with The Last Samurai and Glory. Again, Zwick proves to deliver a very compelling film.To start off, the film is about an ordinary fisherman named Soloman (Dijmon Houson) who has a perfect family and perfect life in South Africa. It is all disrupted from rebels who raid his village. His family manages to escape (later captured), but he is held captive and is forced to dig in a mine for diamonds. In his time there, he recovers a diamond that he found and hid it away. He is later taken to prison as the mine gets raided by the South African government.Meanwhile, a South Afican weapons and diamond smuggler named Danny Archer (Leo Dicaprio) makes another one of his deals, but is caught red-handed. As fate has it, both men end up in the same prison. Danny soon learns that Solomon has a diamond and wants it. Both settle a deal: Solomon is to give Danny the diamond, and Danny will get Solomon's family back for him.The two set off on a dangerous and deadly path of finding this diamond with the help of an eager, stubborn journalist (Jennifer Connoly) to get the diamond and reunite Solomon with his family.Hands down, this is one of the best films I have seen this year! Everything was simply great. Dicrapio has proved himself again as being a decent actor and Dijmon Houson gives an absolutely powerful and believable performance of a struggling father who would do anything to get his family back. Dijmon is simply magnificent and deserves an Oscar for his performance. Jeniffer Connoly was great as well in her role.The story was griping and easy to grasp. It was highly emotionally driven, particularly with the philosophy talks of modern-day vents about bloodshed and the problems of the world. Also to note, the scenes of brutal violence left me paralyzed. To add about the violence, the director rubs it in your face and is not afraid to show families and children getting blown away by lead, and people getting tortured, giving an authentic atmosphere of the war driven African continent.The film-making quality captured all of this from the cinematography, use of sound and music, which was all well done. The pace may have been a little slow in a few parts, but the pace is not to be complained about, for I was captivated by this film.easily **** out of **** Among this year's best films!",10,1,2,9 December 2006
Elysium," Filled with clichÃ©s and a pretentious message
","'Elysium' takes place in the year 2154. The wealthy live on an utopia ring-shaped space station where their is no poverty or sickness. This is Elysium. On earth, resides everyone else. One man, who has little time left, embarks on a journey that could create a bridge between both societies. Elysium after all is the place where to postpone mortality. Millions desire such an option. The concept is interesting but its delivery and undertones rub me the wrong way. Why? All the people who live on Elysium are Caucasians led by a power-hungry Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster). The majority of the people depicted on earth are poor, disheveled, crime-ridden Latinos, except of course for Matt Damon's character Max. Coincidence or planned by writer and director Neill Blomkamp, this seems to be a futuristic retelling of the US and Mexico immigration problem gone awry. I am sure I'm not only person who notices this. 'District 9', Blomkamp's 2009 breakthrough film is not so much different than 'Elysium.' Instead, of white people and Latinos, it was oppressed aliens and violent Africans. Either way, immigration gone wrong and the inhumanity towards different races is a common theme for Mr. Blomkamp's movies. It is a noble topic to explore, but it is delivered in a such a way that it feels demeaning and pretentious. The figures that run Elysium are depicted as caricature isolationists that are willing to kill in order to preserve their perfect society whereas all the poor suffering earthlings are all good people who have no choice but to result to thuggery in order to survive. The movie runs into the clichÃ©d scenario of rich versus poor. Even more clichÃ©d are some of the later plot devices and characters. Jodie Foster plays the typical stuck up witch and Sharlton Copley as her crazy henchman revives the badass head mercenary from 'District 9'. Diego Luna plays Max's caring friend to the tee, and Wagner Mourna, the high-tech sidekick, is like a mastermind with too many television sets and too much red bull. As for Damon himself, he does fine. Playing a feeble anti-hero in the first half and then a heroic ass kicking fighter in the second half works to his advantage. After all, he played Jason Bourne right? The performances aren't all that bad, just not that memorable. I get the vibe that the actors were hired to have more fun with their roles rather than take them seriously.What works for 'Elysium' is the gritty raw visual style that Blomkamp has brought for us to the screen. Sure, the movie feels like the unofficial sequel to 'District 9,' but it is still fun. I can never get tired of exploding human bodies, cuts between jerky hand-held and cool slow-motion, or even trashed invested regions. The Visual Effects are another positive addition. When it came to the action scenes, the lines between CGI and animatronics for the robots became blurred. The VFX is that good. While I do not much care for the underlying tones for Neil Blomkamp's new movie, I cannot deny that I found it entertaining.",6,3,6,16 August 2013
Once Upon a Time in America," I wanted to enjoy this film, but I can't...for so many reasons
","Without a doubt, Sergio Leone is one of the greatest directors of all time. And Robert De Niro is among Hollywood's finest actors. Though both worked together in this film 'Once Upon A Time In America', it is awful. The idea of five childhood friends joining together to start an empire of crime is an interesting ideaâ€”which pulled me into viewing this nearly 4-hour feature. So, what makes this movie so bad? Mostly, it is the direction of how the story unfolds. The film's primary focus is on David Aaronson, nicknamed Noodles. The movie jumps around a bit, starting in 1933 (when Noodles is an adult); then jumping 30 years to 1968 (when he is an old man), going back in the 1920s (when he is a kid) and so on. The theme that Leone tries to display to the viewer's is about a man filled with regret and remorse from the way his life turned out, as well as the fate of his friends. I like this. But Leone throws in so many scenes that aren't relevant to the plot. One, is the numerous amounts of sex sequences. Within the first hour of the film, teenage boys are seen doing an obese teen prostitute. How is this pertinent to the movie? It isn't. Later on, there are two very graphic rape scenes. Immediately, this puts me off. What's worse is, is that Noodles commits these. They are very painful to watch and they have no purpose to story at all. Ten minutes right here could have been cut. Perhaps though, these instances are thrown in to show how despicable Noodles and gangsters really are.They are despicable, yet other Hollywood features such as 'The Godfather', 'Goodfellas', and even 'Scarface' somehow hold the magic of making thugs the people to care about. In 'Once Upon A Time In America', there is no one to like or care for, except for the innocent bystanders that get murdered or horribly maimed through the duration of the film. This is what the movie lacks; a reason to sit through the film. Without a character to care about, what's the purpose in watching a film? I guess Leone wanted the viewers to see the ugly side of nature, and not so much of an epic story about loss and regret. In addition, there are other scenes that drag the film to the point of a bore fest. One is a three-minute scene of a kid tempted to eat a desert that he was going to original use to impress a girl. Another is an elongated sequence of a phone ringing. Another is a young gal wondering in a dark room to find a lamp to illuminate the set. Again, what's the point in these? Leone is a master of making scenes move by at a slow pace. This is good for his westerns when the good and bad guy square off for a final duel, but not for a kid wanting to eat a desert. Scenes like this divert from the story, making it dull and hard to pay attention to. Leone may have well have added a 5-minute scene of Noodles sitting on the toilet, grunting. In contrast, important scenes and characters are left merely implied. One that comes to mind is Joe Pesci's character. He's such a great actor, but he's only in 1 scene and disappears from radar completely, and you'd think he's the type of character you'd see again. Another is the whole bank job that the gang was going to pull off. It was a setup, but it would've been interesting to see how it unfolded, rather than merely told by a character in the feature. The acting is not too bad; I was thoroughly impressed by the child actors. Unfortunately there is an awful miscast, Elizabeth McGovern as Noodles love interest. She looked bored through the whole film. Hearing her talk is like listening to nails on a chalkboard. Even Noodles makes the remark to her later in the film, 'You're a lousy actress.' I chuckled at that, catching a little inside joke there. I may come off as seeming to hate this movie. Believe it or not, I don't. The cinematographer pulled off some sweeping shots of New York City. The sets and costumes are exquisite, and I love Ennio Morricone's score. I'll admit that at times, Morricone's score was over sentimental and bombastic in some key scenes. The gangster flick is a genre I enjoy, but 'Once Upon A Time In America' is not qualified as a great one in my book. It's too bad, because this was Leone's last film, and I hoped this was going to be his best. If you like Sergio, stick with his old westerns.",3,4,12,27 July 2011
Taken," Liam is the driving force in the movie
","I did see this movie on opening weekend but I have not gotten the chance to sit down and write my review for it. Now that I finally have the chance here it goes. I won't bother in mentioning the plot for the trailers show plenty of it (but not necessarily all of it). This movie is an action flick, and I love action, but that is not the main reason why I enjoyed it.Over the years, I have seen Liam Neeson in many movies and even if the film is horrible, he makes something out of it. He gives an exceptional performance. His role his rather unique, because I'm not used to him as a leading action hero, nonetheless, he pulls it off and adds both humane and grim layers to his character, which I love (you'll see what I mean by this when you watch the film). The rest of the movie is solid, ranging from the excellent car and on-foot pursuits, to the gun battles, hand-to-hand combat and the interesting plots and surprising emotional impact. It's good, but Liam is the driving force. I rooted for him throughout the movie. Overall rating *** out of ****",8,1,2,18 March 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Beautifully done yet it runs into a big clichÃ©
","I watched the old 'Alice In Wonderland' cartoon when I was a kid and I found it both weird and scary. Every single creature Alice encountered, it seemed to either taunt her or intended to due her harm. Heck, even the part when Alice broke down and cried, I sobbed along with her. Though a traumatic event in my childhood, I couldn't resist the temptation of Johnny Depp teaming up with Tim Burton once again for their take on the frightening, bizarre, and disturbing tale of 'Alice in Wonderland'. Now I expected this movie to be a remake of the 1950s cartoon, but instead it is a sequel. Alice, now 19, is forced into a marriage by her mother but as fate would have it, she sees a white rabbit with a ticking clock and chases after him into an endless hole, which then follows into another series of unfortunate events, somewhat like before, but yet with a totally different plot. This time, Alice has a purpose in Wonderland, to conquer the Red Queen and her fierce servant, the Jabberwocky.The cast for this movie is impeccable. Beneath the top hat and make up, Johnny Depp, probably one of the most versatile acts of our time, is simply brilliant as The Mad Hatter. Helena Bonham Carter, as the Red Queen is likewise irresistible. Her figure, demeanor, (and with the help of the wonderful make up design) makes her into her character. I can't help but smile as she shouts, 'Off his head!' Mia Wasikowska as Alice and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen are also decent in their roles, (I particularly love Hathaway's stark contrast from the Red Queen as a loving, yet somewhat quirky character), but the real geniuses are Depp and Carter and the remarkable voice talents of Michael Sheen (the White Rabbit), Alan Rickman (the Caterpillar), and Stephen Fry (the Cheshire Cat) to name a few. The visual effects, costumes, and set designs are all beautiful, and there's some pretty cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. His work somewhat reminds me of Andrew Lesnie's mesmerizing work for 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' in that it is colorful but at the same time a bit desaturated, which helps add the dark mood that looms in Wonderland. His work is very noticeable in the locations of the Red and White Queen's castlesÂ…one brightly illuminated, the other, dark and haunted. Danny Elfman's score adds another layer of darkness, mystery, and beauty to the film, though at times it seemed a bit bombastic.Despite all of this greatness to the film, it runs into a problem. Like most fantasy films nowadays, it all leads to a big battle sequence, which we have seen in almost every other movie. It has almost become a clichÃ© that all fantasy epics most end in a big battle sequence. And on top of that, the movie feels rushed. The movie's pace is excellent; I was interested in it from start to finish, but 1 hour and 40 minutes seems a little short to cover all the details that are contained in the movie's story. Nevertheless, this treat by Tim Burton is a good film, thought not for the whole family, due to some surprising grisly images that should have made the rating at least a PG-13. The atmosphere on top of that isn't child oriented either. This then makes me wonder what was the audience Tim Burton was aiming for. It's certainly not a kid's movie, but it's not necessarily a movie that most adults would go see. Then again, the whole Alice in Wonderland concept really isn't a child's story either. I'm not sure. Anyway, I'm glad I got a chance to see this movie.***/****",7,0,1,25 March 2010
Avatar," James Cameron has risen from the ashes victoriously!
","After going off the face of the earth for over twelve years, James Cameron, one of the great directors of our time, has risen from the ashes victoriously. The CGI is magnificent, and is no doubt the best I've ever seen since Peter Jackson blew the world's mind with his 'Lord of the Rings Trilogy'. The motion capture on the actors' bodies looks so real, that it took me to another dimension, almost another world. This grandeur was not only captured through the character animation, but also with the different CGI location shots of the different creatures, the forest, the trees, and the whole world he has created. This world reminded me very much of the 1992 release of 'Ferngully', but in 3-D. Now regarding the plot, it is James Cameron simplicity-a paraplegic soldier (Sam Worthington) is given the opportunity to take in part of a mission on the planet Pandora. There, he learns that a greedy corporation intends to drive out the planet's inhabitants, the Na'vi, so to retrieve millions of dollars worth of minerals. In exchange for a spinal surgery that'll fix his legs, he gathers information for a military unit, led by a bloodthirsty Colonel (Stephen Lang) while simultaneously attempting to infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an 'avatar' identity. As time passes and tension increases between the Na'vi and the humans, he is drawn between his orders and what he desires. The plot sounds simple enough, yet I can't help but notice all of the undertones that James Cameron throws into his film. Without giving too much more of the story away, it made me think of how the U.S. government bullies people into what they want, particularly with the Iraq War, which is a fight over oil, at the cost of innocent Iraqi lives. I don't know if this was Cameron's intent, but this movie gives a pale reflection of our modern government and big corporations. It also reflects on our issue with planet life. Cameron paints the marines as bloodthirsty villains who lust for destruction, but the Na'vi on the other hand, are deep lovers of nature and peace. This reminds me very much of the cowboy and Indian scenario depicted graphically in films such as 'Little Big Man' and 'Dances with Wolves', the white man's inability to make peace with both nature and different races. The Na'vi themselves remind me much of the Native Americans, despite the fact they're blue with pointy ears, and with golden eyes.Overall, there is much to look forward to in 'Avatar', and not just in the visual effects department. The actors all did a great job but I don't expect any of them to be nominated for an Oscar. On a personal note though, Stephen Lang as the gung-ho Colonel and Sigourney Weaver as the peace loving Scientist gave the best performances, and not because both are at the opposite ends of the spectrum, but with the fact they immersed themselves deeply into their characters so magically. And for a 162-minute film, it flies by. There's no way you can be bored with this movie. James Cameron has once again made another excellent film that I'll declare as 2009's best film, and I'm considering in adding 'Avatar' on my personal favorite list of movies. This movie has everything, effects (both visually and emotionally), believable characters, an interesting plot, and a fast pace. And trust me, at the end of the movie, you'll be cheering for the Na'vi.",10,11,19,19 December 2009
Chariots of Fire," This did not deserve Best Picutre for 1981
","After finally seeing 'Chariots of Fire', I now understand what all the fuss is about it. Vangelis' score is simply brilliant, a well-deserved Oscar. The costume and set-decoration add to the authenticity of the film's time period. The work of cinematography gives the dramatic feeling of the film. The screenplay and actors are good. But of the other nominees for Best Picture in 1981, I found this to be a feeble win at the Academy.Unlike 'On Golden Pond', the movie does not develop great characters nor does it have memorable performances like Henry Fonda and Katherine Hepburn delivered. The motives of the two runners, Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) are understandable. Both are competitive individuals and with such a competition, they push themselves harder and harder. But they both come from different religious families.Harold, who's Jewish, feels it is his obligation to make himself the best, for fame and to escape prejudice. However, there is no external conflict shown in the movie that makes him feel so determined to be the best. For most individuals, it takes something from the past to spark someone's heavy interest in such a thing. A person just doesn't wake up one morning and say I'm going to be a runner. I felt his character wasn't developed, just thrown into Cambridge, running laps, saying, 'I need to do better than this' to the amusing Ian Holm.It is also the same with Eric. As a catholic Scot, he feels it's his job to win for God. Well, why? Sure, the film shows that he has a religious uptight family, but the story does not broaden off of that. The movie doesn't even bother to develop his relationship that diminishes with his significant other. So, I am left as a mere observer rather than being pulled into the film.The only thing that pulled me into the film was Vangelis' score which made the movie. I enjoyed the slow-motion images of the runners running, but it got very tiresome after awhile, particularly at the end of the movie with the Olympic Games. I couldn't help but laugh at the actor's faces as they ran in slow-motion. It almost made me think of the different expressions Bruce Banner would make as he's mutating into the Hulk.In addition without strong character development, the accents are very thick. I have no problem with Brits, but when I have to put subtitles on the DVD in order to understand what the people are saying, it becomes a real hassle. It's not a bad movie, but nothing that deserved close to Best Picture. 7/10 If you won't great movies of 1981, see 'Raiders of The Lost' or 'On Golden Pond'.",7,5,10,4 April 2008
The Artist," A pleasure to watch
","'The Artist' is most likely the first silent film for many Americans. I have seen the works of Charlie Chaplin as well as Mel Brooks's 'Silent Movie,' and they are very entertaining films. What helps 'The Artist' excel so well is its nostalgic look of old movies. The sets, costumes, cinematography, music, opening titles, special effects, and even visual humor takes me back to Chaplin's 'City Lights.' The magic that director Michel Hazanvicius creates for this movie is not limited to its visual style. The plot is very originalâ€”a silent film star reaches the top of his game only to be replaced by talkies and new faces. Many silent actors faced this and fell into oblivion. In Hazanvicius's world, George Valentine is such a person. His downward spiral is filmed in such a unique way that it is both dark and mystical. In one particular scene, George sits in a bar, in a drunken stupor. He begins to hallucinate and sees a miniature version of himself on the bar table, jeering at him for his failures. Other grim scenes like these are mesmerizing to watch.Though there are dark moments in this film, it is generally a light-hearted flickâ€”I had a smile on my face for the majority of the movie. The performances by Jean Dujardin as George Valentine and Bernice Bejo as Peppy Miller range from over the top to subtle. Whenever they are on-screen together, it is easy to tell that they adore one another. As the audience, we too enjoy their presence. It is particularly interesting that there is a romance between the two, yet they never kiss or make loveâ€”Hazanvicius avoids this typical plot device that is seen in almost every romance flick, and it is a nice break. Dujardin and Bejo aren't the only ones who steal the show. The great supporting cast is made up of John Goodman, James Cromwell, and Uggio, as Valentine's dog. Uggio, in particular, has his comic moments.Probably the biggest advantage for 'The Artist' is the music. It is such a great soundtrack that it emphasizes the mood on the screen to perfection. When George Valentine is at the top of his game, the music is uplifting with a kind of 'doinky-doinky' sound. As Valentine deteriorates, it grows bombastic and ominous.Though a very well-crafted film, 'The Artist' has problems. Some subplots involving the characters are not resolved or further explained. There is also the tendency that there are lengthy discussions between characters without any title cards. This became very annoying, for I began to focus on trying to read the lips of the actors rather than view the movie. It would have been more appropriate for the editors to either cut these scenes down or add more cards. To say that 'The Artist' is a better film than any of Chaplin's works is sacrilegious. But to say that this film is overrated and uneventful is far from true. Winning five Academy Awards and earning over $45 million in limited release alone is a well-earned achievement.",9,0,2,23 July 2012
Invictus," Inspiring and uplifting!
","Originally, I thought this movie was going to be a biopic on the life of Nelson Mandela. To some degree, it is a biography on Mr. Mandela, but the film's main focus is on his idea of inspiring a country that is drawn to crime, violence, and poverty (after years of Apartheid) to a glimpse of hope via the nation's rugby team. Without a doubt, this is the perfect role for Morgan Freeman. I will note that his accent comes and goes throughout the film, but he nails the role down. He is not overly dramatic nor does he just read the script. He becomes the man. Morgan Freeman is easily one of my favorite actors because he never plays himself. He always makes himself into the character he's assigned to. He'll definitely receive the Best Actor nom, and hopefully, Morgan can finally win the Oscar he so desperately deserves.Regarding Matt Damon as the rugby coach (Francois Pienaar), he too immerses himself into his role. He even maintains a solid accent. However, the sympathy of the film is aimed towards Mandela than it is to Francois. The other cast members (none of which I recognized) also gave decent, believable performances. As with the plot, it is predictable, something we've seen beforeÂ…underdog overcomes impossible odds, yet screenwriter Anthony Peckham throws in many important themes that may seem all to familiar, but is nonetheless eye-opening such as: forgiveness, unity, and determination to do what is right. Racial tension between the whites and blacks is dominant in the movie, particularly between the black and white security guards, but the film's point, as well as Mandela's goal, is to put our differences aside and work together as one.The movie isn't just about a rugby game, but rather organizing a nation to a success. It may be considered a wise political move on Mandela's part, but as Morgan says to his aid, 'It is a human calculation'. People need inspiration in order to change and to do good. These themes are what make it a good film. It also makes it a different kind of sports movie. Tom Stern's cinematography is wonderful, and this time, he doesn't make the movie all sepia tone like in 'Letters of Iwo Jima' or 'Changeling' and I congratulate the editors Joel Cox and Gary Roach once again for making each shot beautifully seamless and well structured for the storyline. The music by Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens is not just a pretty tone that plays along with the movie, but it adds some oomph and emotion. I particularly love their choice of African vocals, for it not only makes the film feel more real, but it is absolutely beautiful to listen to. Clint Eastwood has done another great movie. Not only has he captured the themes of the story, but also the poverty of South Africa as well as the intense rugby sequences. There are some powerful scenes in this movie, as well as some intense and suspenseful ones, and even ones that'll make you smile. For the first time in a movie for this year, I actually cried. Not because of sadness, but from joy.'Invictus' is an inspiring film. Some back-story could have been added to the characters and the first act could have been faster, but overall, I enjoyed this film. 'Invictus' proves that it doesn't take special effects and big action sequences to make a great film. It is excellent to see one of our great old directors to recognize this, and display it so wonderfully without being preachy about it.",10,90,112,11 December 2009
Super 8," Super 8 is the reason why I see the movies
","Super 8 is not what the trailers build it up asâ€”another science-fiction end of the world scenario. J.J. Abrams has something much more unique and surprising in mind. Abrams focus is not the visual effects; they are actually kept to a minimum, but rather the characters and the plot. I did not recognize any of the actors, but all of them perform flawlessly, especially the kids. They are so amusing to watch on the big screen, as well as engaging. When they laugh, you laugh with them. When they are in danger, you feel that anxiety. When they are in pain, you feel itâ€”and it hurts. If there was a best ensemble cast award, this feature should win it. If I had to pick the best of all of the actors, it would Elle Fanningâ€”though very unlikely, she deserves an Oscar for her performance. I will admit that J.J. Abrams seemed to borrow some elements of other films, such as: E.T., War of the Worlds, The Goonies, Signs, and Transformers. Even so, this film stands as its own and it is not a ripoff, like some of the more newer sci-fi releases. It is a creative and a special film to watch. Abrams even ties in some powerful symbolism and themes into this film without getting preachyâ€”I will not give these or the story away, for they are that good. One thing that some people may not like about this film is how loud the sound design is. It is really loud, particularly with the jump moments and a train crash sequence. I personally don't like deafening sound in theaters, but this technique by the sound designers and editors fits the film perfectlyâ€”the movie would not have had such an impact without this approach. In short, 'Super 8' is the reason why I see movies. It has believable, compelling performances, sublime film-making, a creative story, and it is well-paced. There is also plenty of action, suspense, drama, and humor. This film is also beautifully photographed, with awesome sound, and Michael Giacchino's best score to date. If you have lost faith in Hollywood's release of movies, see Super 8. J.J. Abrams has a shot to revive the film industry from the dumper that it has been heading in for the last decade.

The Last Samurai," A film that demands our surrender to its film-making, acting, story, and above all its romantic vision of a forgotten world!
","This film was no doubt the best film of 2003. It is totally underrated and cheated in the Oscar academy! It is a film that actually has talent and beauty to it from its story to its vision of ancient Japan that has been swept into modernization.the film is about two men. there's Kotsumoto and Nathan Algren. Kotsumoto (Ken Watanbe) is a samurai leader who witnesses his country being overtaken by modernization which leads to a change in the whole country from the new rising power of the Emperor Meiji, who took power for himself over Japan. Kotsumoto and the other samurai feels this is immoral and a disgrace to the motherland of Japan and pollutes the traditions and cultures of Japan. he and the other samurai must restore it to where it originally was before the Americans arrived.Meanwhile, across the Atlantic Ocean, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a drunken, ex-war veteran who drinks to relieve himself from a massacre he was a part of against the Native Americas. By fate, he meets a war friend (Billy Connoly) who found a job for the both of them, which is to train the Japanese army against the samurai, and was arranged by Nathan's old, cruel commander he has a score to settle with (Tony Goldwyn), and a greedy Japanese political figure named Omara.Here, Nathan goes on a journey into the modern rising Japan. As he trains the army without much of a success, they are set on a mission to wipe out the samurai in the mountains. They are ambushed, most of the imperial soldiers are killed, and Nathan is captured by the samurai. Here he meets the samurai leader Kotsumoto and develops a strong relationship with him based upon the samurai code, the meanings of life, and their fates and destinies.The Last Samurai is a powerfully moving film with some of the best acting i have ever seen since the film Gladiator. Ken Watanbe deserved the Oscar for his role of Kotsumoto. The cinematography was beautiful, and depicts the reality of japan's beautiful views of land. the costumes and set-decorations were fabulous, the battle sequences were well choreographed and intense, the story was gripping, and above all the score by Hans Zimer uplifted the film to a scale of grandeur. Easily a **** out of **** If only more films were like this one. This is why we see the movies!",10,1,3,29 May 2006
Life Is Beautiful," A humorous, romantic, and passionate film at its best on a grand scale!
","This is one of the few movies that have been made that is not an action flick or a special effects film. Sometimes, filmmakers need to make some descent films that aren't so action-packed or have a bad storyline like a slasher flick. The film is both humorous and sad. The only problem with the film was some of the corny parts of showing the holocaust unrealistically and some of the sets were like a B movie. Otherwise it was a great picture.I really enjoy the character Guido from his unusual taste of humor. I liked the romance between him and the attractive Dora, and the passion he shows by making his own life a sacrifice for his son's. I think the best part in the entire movie was the ending when the son gets the chance to a ride on an army tank, following the embrace of mother and son. I am glad this film won three academy awards, including Best Actor.",10,2,4,1 April 2004
Up," Two Thumbs Way Up for Up!
","I originally did not plan to see 'Up' fearing that it would not be any good. Then again, Pixar has done well the last two years with 'Ratatouille' and 'Walle'. For the heck with it, along with some friends, I went to see it last night. The theater was packed, specifically with parents and their little ones. From start to finish, there was hardly any noise in the theater, except for the constant laughter. What I'm saying is, is that 'Up' delivers.What's nice about 'Up' is that it is not only great for kids, but also for adults. I've been noticing lately that Pixar has been incorporating mature themes in their films. Without giving too much away about the plot, 'Up' deals with things that every person encounters, the loss of a loved one, and the sense of helplessness it brings. Heavy subject matter, but it doesn't make the film too mature nor does it make it syrupy. The message the film delivers, the ability to go fulfill a childhood dream and go on an adventure, if even you think you've outgrown it is brilliant. Watching this movie made me feel like a little kid again. Well done. The voice talent is wonderful. I did not recognize many of the cast members' voices, which I think is a good thing, because a big celebrity like Eddie Murphy or Mike Myers can divert from the intended story. The animation isn't corny nor is it over the top like in 'Happy Feet.' Michael Giacchino's score adds a whole new level to the film. It helps propel the story. When the movie hits a sad moment, the music makes you want to cry. When it hits a suspenseful moment, it makes you want to grab onto the edge of your seat. Rarely do I give a perfect, but 'Up' deserves one from me. Two Thumbs Way Up for Up! It makes you feel sad. Makes you feel exhilarated. Makes the time fly by. It makes you laughÂ…a lot. My rating: **** out of ****",10,2,5,22 June 2009
National Treasure," Good fun, and entertainment, but a bit on the pointless side.
","i enjoyed this film. It is a good popcorn movie to enjoy with the family. there is no swearing i found, a couple of violent and scary images, but that's it. I rather enjoyed this film, but i was expected something else of the gang traveling across the world when it's only across the U.S. the acting was okay, with a comic relieve, dumb bad guys with a typical mean villain portrayed by the wonderful Sean Bean, and relentless action sequences, that is adrenaline. National Treasure is a cute movie. i did find it on the pointless side, knowing that this oculdn't happen and how cartoonish eve3rything seemed, with obvious chaos and mayhem, but, that's the story of a race between good and evil. **** out *****. Descent entertainment, but i prefer Pirates and the Incredibles.",8,0,0,24 November 2004
How to Train Your Dragon," Good voice acting, Great Animation, and a Wonderful Score
","'How To Train Your Dragon'? Really? Come on! You can sense my skepticism about this feature by simply mentioning its title. It sounds quite ridiculous, yet it fits perfectly. The story is simple. With a Viking setting, a boy who wants to be a warrior befriends an injured dragon and develops an unlikely friendship with it. The plot does not provide anything new, yet the animators do a swell job of making the audience fall in love with dragons. The combination of character's facial expressions and animation makes this feature among the best I have seen. The voice talent is exquisite, especially Jay Baruchel as the lead protagonist. What adds another flavor to this animated feature is John Powell's score. I knew it was not going to win at the Oscars, yet I was hoping it would. I have listened to all of the scores nominated at the 2011 Oscars and this was easily the best. Though a seemingly a simple tune, the music erupts into a fantastic orchestra, which takes the story to a whole new level; like what John Williams did for 'Star Wars'. When watching this on a DVD player, I just had to crank up the volume as I found myself conducting to the musical composition. Sorry for sounding absurd, but John Powell has created a gem that cannot be topped and it has truly touched the essence of my heart. My rating: 3.5 out of 4If you have not seen this animated feature, you are really missing out.",9,0,0,10 September 2011
Pulp Fiction," Different, Intense, Violent, Funny, Philosophical, overall a Quentin Tarantino Picture!
","People that I know call 'Pulp Fiction' unique but one of the best movies ever made. I've only see two films by Quentin Tarantino, and they were both of the Kill Bills. I liked both movies as the 'popcorn loving' action and dark comedy junkie that I am. So I expected something along that line for 'Pulp Fiction'. It is far from it.The best way I can describe this film is a non-chronological list of stories combined together with roller-coaster circumstances. Yes, there is some action. And yes, there is a lot of wicked humor. But what held my attention was the brilliant script by Quentin Tarantino (who won the Oscar for it in 1994). Even more so, the all-star cast flourished it with some stunning performances. John Travolta shed a whole new light on his acting ability as the cynical hit man, Vincent Vegas. Bruce Willis as the boxer, Butch is in a sense a protagonist, but also a man determined to do whatever it takes to get what he wants, even if it means killing. Uma Thurman is simply marvelous as the amusing drug addict Mia. Also included is: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, and Harvey Keitel are all nice additions to the film.Of all the performances, I found Samuel L. Jackson's to be the best. I always remember Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus in Die Hard 3, but as Jules in Pulp Fiction, he is larger than life. He's cool and funny, but also philosophical and the only character that changes his values towards the end of the film. He was snubbed at the Oscars. I was so captivated by the film that I did not even bother to realize that the movie was over two and a half hours. I can't help but say this is a great film. It is not my favorite, but I will agree that this should stay on the top ten at IMDb's top 250. 10/10",10,1,2,14 May 2008
Les MisÃ©rables," A very good musical, but it has its hiccups
","Les Miserables is such a good story that it has been made into dozens of movies, Broadway plays, and even a musical. Having seen the Liam Neeson and Richard Chamberlain versions, the plot is very familiar to me. Watching the musical Broadway version brought to the screen by Tom Hooper was something refreshing and new. The conventional musical is driven by a plot with long scenes of dialog, followed by intermittent musical numbers. The great old classics like 'The Sound of Music' and 'West Side Stories' were in part successful because of this. This technique gives the audience time to anticipate and enjoy the singing and music as well as comprehend the movie's plot at the same time. 'Les Miserables' on the other hand breaks this well known method. The entire film is true music; each musical sequence follows the other without a break or a chance for any dialog. This is a very unique and creative technique. However, it presents a double-edged sword. From the positive, it presents solid entertainment. There are no dull scenes or elongated monologues by the characters. You can close your eyes and see exactly what it is happening without even watching it like listening to a CD. The negative, it may annoy and confuse the audience, specifically individuals who seek the typical musical movie style. Even worse, the movie can deliver an incomplete story that makes no sense. There are scenes in this movie that quickly jump from one thing to the next without any explanation, much less giving the viewer enough to digest the information from the prior musical number. The plot becomes jumbled and incoherent on several occasions. While the music and singing is beautiful, some of it is very soft-spoken, which makes it even harder to understand. In already knowing the story of 'Les Miserables' though, these hiccups do not affect me very much. Through the whole movie, I fondly watched each moment with a gentle smile on my face.The wisely-chosen cast is what really make this film successful. Each actor and actress immersed themselves into their roles. The prominent ones are Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway, who give the performances of their lives. Of the two, Jackman no doubt had the more challenging role. He not only had to sing for the two hours and thirty-seven minute film, but he had to undergo physical transformations for his character. On top of that, he had to act with powerful emotion. Within the first ten minutes, I can tell he put everything he had into this role. He became Jean Valjean in body, mind, and soul. His golden globe win and Oscar nomination was well worth it. I would very much like to see Jackman break his action hero norm more for some dramatic performances. Being in the movie under twenty minutes, Anne Hathaway delivered one of the most devastating performances an audience can ask for as Fontaine. Like Jackman, her physical appearance is changed, but her solo 'I Dreamed a Dream' is enough to make a sensible viewer weep. It is amazing that one five-minute scene can win someone an Oscar, a golden globe, a Screen Actor's Guild, and a BAFTA. And she deserved it. While the rest of the cast is decent, they are dwarfed in comparison to Jackman and Hathaway. Even the great Russell Crowe as Javert does not stand very strong in comparison to the intensely passionate Hugh Jackman. Neither do the quirky Sacha Baren Cohen and funny Helena Bonham Carter make an equal to the powers of Jackman and Hathaway. A big shocker indeed. They all have a very good singing voices. Crowe has a band after all. Both Carter and Cohen starred in Sweeney Todd together (bringing some elements of those past characters to life I might add)'Les Miserables' is a very good movie. Great music. Great singing. Great cast. Great costumes and set pieces. But if you're expecting a musical with a great story, it will not be found here. Many things are left implied. It will better that you know the story in advance before viewing this film.",8,1,1,9 June 2013
The Da Vinci Code," Very Impressive, but the book is better...
","Like millions worldwide, I've read the book and found it amazing. I waited anxiously to see this in theaters. i saw it opening weekend, and I have to say that I was impressed with the film. It followed very closely to the book. I honestly have to say that over 90% of it followed the book, which is very rare to most films based off of books.For those of you who don't know what the Da Vinci code is about, it is a controversial tale of the fact that Jesus was married, and that there was a bloodline that ran to the modern-day.The film, like the book opens with a savage murder of a clergyman in Paris, France. A specialist in religion and mythology, Rob Langdon (Tom Hanks) is called in to help with the investigation. Unfortunately, the truth be told, he's under investigation for the murder. But as fate has, a French detective, Sophie Nevereu (Audrey Tatou) believes his innocence, and thus begins the quest in search for the holy grail.I don't want to say anymore, for I'll spoil the film. But basically, these two go on mission that involves the biggest, religious cover up in history. The film has an all star cast such as: Sir Ian McKellan, who is flat-out excellent as Teabing, Paul Bettany, who gives a creepy feeling of the albino monk Silas, Capt. Fache (jean Reno), who is also great, and many more faces.This film was excellent. As previously said, it follows the book very closely, it's acting is superb, and i also have to add that the film-making quality was great too. the cinematography use of blended colors gave an eerie, religious feeling, the music by the ultimate Hans Zimmer, had the same effect as the cinematography, and the other technical uses and set-decoration was fabulous.After saying all that, there was some negative sides to it as well. first off, it was a slow movie. The book was a page-turner, but the film didn't have that quick pace as I thought it would, and also some of the story was left out, especially at the finale which made me feel disappointed. I know most producers feel that they have to rush the end of film's, but that's no exception for a film like this! Besides those two problems, the film was fantastic in my mind, and is one of this year's best films. overall rating ***1/2 out of **** I have to warn, it is controversial on religion, and many maybe offended by it. To me though, it is just entertainment that flew very well.",9,1,2,18 October 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Real magic! A fantastic magic film!
","Harry Potter was honestly the best picture of the year 2001. It was funny, scary, mysterious, magical, vivid, non-stopped action sequences, magnificent effects, and awesome! The movie rules over the book, for the book was slow moving and got kind of dull for me. The director Christopher Columbus was the right choice for directing the fantasy film, who also directed my family fun films the Home Alone series. Plus, I honestly was not sure what I was reading. However, the only problem with the film was it was hokey in some places, including the troll scene in the girls bathroom. Otherwise it was well done. The second was also equally good, but I have a feeling the third one is going to be a failure to Harry Potter fans.",8,0,0,1 March 2004
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Visually stunning, but a choppy storyline...
","The fourth book of the Harry Potter series is my favorite of all the books. The story for me was gripping, exciting, and the whole climax of the tale of Potter. The film however had somewhat of a different aspect.First off, I'll say the film's visuals were stunning, the sets, costumes, music score, and acting was top notch, especially with Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, who was the best cast member of this entire film, even though he was only in it for ten minutes. Depsite all of this, the storyline was very weak and choppy. Technically, the director threw scene after scene into the viewers' face, making the story rather hard to make sense of and of course leaving plenty of plot holes like the last film! So, the story, cutting over sixty pages out, starts off with Harry already at the Weasleys' house. The Weasley family and Harry, with Hermione happening to be there, head out to the Quidditch cup, a major sporting event in the Wizard world. The first fifteen minutes fly by with not much of an explanation, and it cuts out the biggest action sequence in the whole darn book! Then, after the match being over with no game being shown, a gang of Voldemort's followers attack the location of the Quidditch cup.The story continues on with rumors of the dark lord rising, with his spies within the wizard world both in the ministry and in the school of Hogwarts. As this goes on, two new schools arrive, for it was the year of the Trizward Tournament. There are supposed to be three contestants, with one from each school, but a fourth is chosen, inevitably...Harry Potter. The film thickens, and finally becomes juicy and entertaining with the game of life and death.Little does Harry know that a close friend of his is a secret vassal of the dark lord! So, I loved everything of this film, except for the storyline, which is critical to any film or book. So, I generously and deepest in my heart give this film a **** out of ****** Truly, this is better than the other films. Not perfect, but adequate.",8,0,0,24 December 2005
The Happening," Interesting...
","I saw this movie yesterday and I have to say that this was a good movie by M. Night Shyamalan. It's not his best but definitely not horrible or bad like 'The Village'. Instead of focusing on science-fiction and fantasy that he has done in the past, his eyes are on Mother Nature.The film opens with Mark Wahlberg's character Elliot Moore instructing a class about the honey bees' populations that are dramatically decreasing across the world. I've never heard of such a case, but after doing a little inquiring and research, I learned that this is known as CCD or Colony Collapse Disorder. It is unknown why this is happening. If the bees go instinct, it could very well cause the extinction of the human race.The film's plot brings in the question: What if plants and nature can turn against us by our abuse and hate? As an airborne toxin sweeps through the Manhattan, making people kill themselves, Elliot Moore, his wife (Zooey Deschanel), his friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and his daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) are forced to flee Philadelphia and travel cross country to avoid the toxin.'The Happening' is a very interesting movie that captures suspense, mystery, drama, and character development that is well in Shyamalan's capability. He once again proves to be one of Hollywood's most daring and unusual directors. The score by James Newton Howard is haunting and the work of the cinematographer helps plaster the landscapes that bring the winds of destruction.Sure, 'The Happening' may seem unrealistic like many Shyamalan movies are, but is it? Could nature turn against us? I'm probably one of the few who appreciate this movie, but again, it is not Shyamalan's best work partly because of the R rating. It was rather shocking to watch the explicit scenes of violent suicides and murders that made me jump and at time gasp. To me, it did not seem like Shyamalan's style since all his other movies are PG-13 or lower. The other thing I did not like about this movie was its pace. The film seemed to go by too quickly. There is some character development but not enough to make it moving like 'Signs' or 'Lady in the Water'. I was also hoping for Shyamalan to make his appearance in the film like he does in his other ones, but he doesn't. 7/10 -Give it a chance; it's better than what most critics say.",6,2,8,17 June 2008
The Godfather: Part III," It isn't a bad nor is it 'an offer that can't be refused'
","I love the first two 'Godfathers', but this one did not have the caliber of the first two. There are things that make this movie feel like a 'Godfather' but there are also things that don't. Starting with the good, I found the plot to be very interesting. More than twenty years after where the second Godfather left off, Michael Corleone seeks to make his family legitimate by buying up part of the organizations in the Vatican. Things don't go as he had planned and once again he is pulled back in to fight off new foes and reinstate his family in the mafia with the help of a young protÃ©gÃ© that loves his daughter. It sounds pretty good, but much of the old cast is gone from the original two films. It would make sense for some of their characters to die off over more than a twenty year range, but many of the new faces aren't competent, particularly Sofia Coppola. I can understand Francis Ford Coppola would want his daughter in production to start her career. She's good-looking but she is bland and uneventful.Eli Wallach seemed to enjoy himself as Don Altobello, the clever backstabber. Joe Mantgena as Joey Zasa was all right, I guess, but he gets killed off before he even gets a chance to develop his character. I have to add that, none of the Corleone family's enemies are developed, nor are their motives clear for why they want to kill Michael. This may have been intended since greed is a common thing that drives many people, but is there anything else? The film seemed to focus on what gruesome death the other mob bosses get rather than explain their characters' motives. Talia Shire was a nice addition to the film. Her character has changed from the abused wife in Part I, to the pitiful widow in Part II, and to a cunning mastermind in this one. She's one of the few well-developed characters. Of all the Godfathers, this one has my favorite performance by Al Pacino. His character was youthful and cunning in the first two but now he is an old man that is haunted by his past demons and wants forgiveness from the things he has done as a mob boss. His silent scream at the end of the film is priceless and moving. I'm surprised he did not an Oscar nom for his performance. Andy Garcia was also great as Sonny's hotheaded son Vincent, who later becomes Michael's protÃ©gÃ©. But what disturbed me was the unwanted development of his lust for Michael's daughter. Incest is something I don't look forward to in a mob film, particularly a Godfather. Like the first two films, it has beautiful production design, costumes, and grim cinematography. It has the original score that Nino Rota composed wonderfully for the Godfather Part I & II but unfortunately Nino died before this one was in the making. So a new composer takes his place and adds some music to it that makes the film feel hokey. The music reminds me of something that would be in a cheap soap opera. It gets too dramatic in a scene of suspense and too melancholy at an emotional part. It isn't a bad nor is it 'an offer that can't be refused'. 7/10",7,0,1,6 May 2008
The Fountain," Bewilderment...
","First off, I have to state that in order to explain this film, you have to see it yourself. it is almost impossible to write this review, for the film had so much wonder that left me and the audience bewildered and speechless. It is a highly unusually film that could be seen in many different views. That said, a lot of previous reviews of this film that I have read are quite different and off key, at least from the way I viewed the film.To put this film in simpler terms, it is about the whole topic of death. Which includes spirituality, reincarnation, loads and loads of symbolism, specifically with trees, henceforth the tree of life, and also various time periods. The story is about a couple Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) and Izzi Creo (rachel Weisz). It ends up that Izzy has cancer and is near death. Tom does everything in his power to stop her from dying.meanwhile, back in the 1500s, the same two people are in the same circumstances, and Tom, known as the Conquistador is sent to South America to locate the Tree of Life. Both stories intertwine and bring together neatly and dramatically with surprising ends. both are great pieces to the story.However, the third story is very confusing, which is the story 500 years from modern-day, and it is when Tom is an astronaut, who is bound to a tree that is dying, supposedly representing his ill wife. he travels in a bubble to a star that suppsoedly gives you rebirth and life. This story, in my mind, pulled away and created diversions from the original two stories. It took a long time to explain what the story stood for, and it at least gave some explanation at the end of the film, which was no more than mere implications, which left me hanging saying 'Okay, now what?' Another thing about the film was that the director used the same scenes throughout the film, as if to warn the audience, 'okay, it's time for a new scene'. This grew very annoying, and only slowed the pace of the film, making a 95 minute film feel an hour extra longer. These delays also caused some damage to the end, which was left hanging, instead of totally resolved. in other words, there was to be more of the film at the end, but was cut short, and left almost like a cliffhanger (previously stated earlier in the paragraph).Besides these flaws, the film was great. The director uses a lot of up closes and different camera angles compared to the average Hollywood director. Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackamn gave powerful performances, but neither of them were Oscar worthy. The visual effects were flat out amazing, and beyond the works of Lord of the Rings, not to mention the use of beautiful cinematography that gave a feel to the film, as well as other small details such as: costumes, set-decoration, and a moving music score by Clint Mansell.It was a great film that was unfortunately flawed, but still held a strong lesson that tells us that we're all going to die someday, but it's what we do in our life that defines us.*** out of **** Not the best thing, but a decent film",8,1,2,26 November 2006
The Departed," Awesome!
","Okay, I'm not a huge Scorsese fan and entered the theater having possible thoughts that this film was another cop and criminals film. It is a cop and criminals film, but done in a very rare feat of movie-making that blew me away! The film is based off of a previous film made in China that explores both sides of the law through the eyes of two men. both of them are moles who are in deep, seeking out information for the other. Billy Costigan (Leo Dicaprio) plays a hot-headed cop who hasn't graduated the academy yet. he is assigned to go undercover as a henchmen for a ruthless gangster named Costello (Jack Nicholson).Meanwhile, Costello has a mole inside the police department, Det. Sullivan (Matton Damon) who is ambitious and who worked his way quickly through the department to get a high position in the police force. As the story progresses, both sides of the law learn they're being watched and leads to a very violent and shocking conclusion.The acting was top-notched and believable. I'm not much of a Leo fan, but he was flat out excellent and deserves some recognition in the Oscars. Nicholson was pretty much himself with his charm, wicked humor, and psychotic facial expressions. i don't need to mention the rest of the cast, for they were all equally as great, despite the fact that Alec Baldwin stole the show a bit.the story was in-depth and ad a lot of character development, as well as twist and turns and occasional plot holes that were meant to be. The film-making was excellent, especially with the use of old rock'n'roll music such as Pinkfloud and the Rolling stones, the editing was tastefully done, as well as the cinematography, and the pace of the film flew by, feeling like a ninety minute movie versus a two and a half hour film! Despite all of this, I have to say that this film is not for everyone. especially for those who are squeamish to blood, for there is plenty of graphic blood spray, which never really bothers me, but made me gasp and say 'Oh my GoD!' in a few scenes, and there was boat load of swearing that was as bad, if not worse than Bad Boys II.nonetheless, I loved this film, and I think it is the best film of the year, and as well as Scorsese's best film. It was awesome. It had offbeat, and sick humor, action, acting, story, fast-paced, and above all shock value. there is no doubt that this film should get some Oscars!**** out of **** If you are a Scorsese film (which I now am because of this film), and can handle a great deal of violence and swearing, it's for you!",10,0,0,5 November 2006
Psycho," It still has its power as it did in 1960
","Alfred Hitckcock is the master of suspense and mystery. I have now seen four of his movies and I have to say that Psycho is not only among his best of film, but also among the best of the horror genre. Hitchkock's direction was simply marvelous in the 1950s and 60s, and still is today. From the intense facial close-ups to the distant and unusual camera angles, it is impeccable. The music by Bernard Herrmann also adds much to the suspense to the film. I was on the edge of my seat with every beat of the score.Anthony Perkins is simply remarkable as Norman Bates. He isn't the full scale, murder, blood-seeking type of villain that most Hollywood villains are depicted in modern-day horror flicks. He appears as a normal person but has a secret and dark personality. He's creepy and disturbing but yet subtle and calm. He can be pitied, but also feared.Janet Leigh, I will never forget her scream as she faces her inevitable death in the shower sequence. She was also superb in supporting as Bates' first victim. But in my opinion, I felt the shower scene was a little corny. I kind of felt myself laughing at the chocolate syrup that was used for the blood, which I expected to be in more quantity like in Raging Bull. Perhaps I'm just to the blood/gore of the 1980s and modern-day cinema. Then again, it was common for most movies in the 50s and 60s for people on camera to die without spraying an ounce of blood. Despite this little opinion of mine, I loved the movie. It still has its power as it did in 1960. 10/10",10,3,5,20 January 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Not as good as the first one, but still WOW
","There are only rare occasions, in which the sequel is better than the original. In the original 'Transformers' I thought the visual effects could not be topped, but its sequel certainly does. The CGI, sound, and sound editing design is amazing, the best I've seen in any movie. However, this doesn't necessarily mean its better in other aspects. If you're expecting an award winning script or Oscar-worthy performances, this is not the movie for you. The story is interesting, not a bit corny, which is something I give congratz for the writers. The majority of the actors do a decent job. Shia LaBeouf is still amusing as Sam Whitwicky, Megan Fox is sexy as usual as Sam's girlfriend, and John Tuturro is basically himself as the disgraced Agent Simmons who now works in a meat shop. The film also introduces some new characters, both human and machine. I've heard a lot of criticism aimed toward the new autobots, particularly Wheelie and Skids, both of which supply as the comic relief. Yes, they do speak jive, making it hard to understand what they are saying at times, but it adds to their characters. I personally found them hysterical. There is also new villains which are both frightening and appearance and menacing.But if any character is considered annoying, it is Leo played by Ramon Rodriguez. He tries to act like Shia in the horny aspect, but for the rest of the film he whines like a baby. At least Shia makes up as a decent protagonist, which Leo doesn't. I was hoping his character would get his comeuppance, which unfortunately doesn't happen. But there are some other things that I found jarring to this movie. There is a drug reference that is used for a comic effect, but it is way out of proportion to the film. It had no purpose. And there are several unneeded sexual situations that I felt were way too intense for a science-fiction action flick like 'Transformers'. The movie is supposed to be about stuff getting shot up and blown up, not college kids gone wild. That's the 'Animal House' department thank you very much. And I couldn't help but notice that Michael Bay seems to like showing animals and robots humping each other as well as humans. Again, no purpose, very unneeded. Ten minutes of the film could have been saved from all of these things I have mentioned. This movie is far from perfect, but it is not horrible as so many people call it. This is not one for everyone. It has great, long action sequences, big explosions, and the best CGI a person could dream up of (at least for now). If you are looking for this in a movie, you are sure going to enjoy it. If not, that's your call. If there is going to be another 'Transformers' which I think there will be, I'll be in line for it on its opening weekend. My rating: *** out of ****",7,15,26,26 June 2009
Zero Dark Thirty," Subject matter over character and plot
","Bin Laden. Dead. Killed by the US government. Celebrated all over in the Western nations. Why not make a movie about it? So soon too. 'Zero Dark Thirty' is the answer, at least according to director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal. The subject matter is enticing and ambitious, enough for the US critics to give it an automatic 95/100 score on MetaCritic.com. That is a higher rating than 'Schindler's List' and 'The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.' Is this movie really that good? After having just finished the movie not long ago, I cannot but help think what is the fuss all about. Sure, the concept is neat, however, that does not guarantee a spectacular film. 'The Hurt Locker' is a much better film, but I don't hear as much praise for it. The problem with 'Zero Dark Thirty' is that it is a very daunting film. This is not shocking since this 157-minute movie tries to cover an 8 year timeline leading up to Bin Laden's assassination. The first 90 minutes alone are dedicated to how the CIA found the compound that Bin Laden hid out in. Much of this time is full of failed government plans, gratuitous torture scenes, and technical babel. While this set up is important for the sake of the movie, it is very uninspiring and at times confusing for the viewer. The movie itself feels more like a documentary than an actual movie. The style of hand-held camera throughout the film's duration helps attest to this. It is as if writer and director were more interested in trying to show the behind-the-scenes of a great manhunt rather than telling a good story with memorable characters. Very little character development is formed, especially with the lead CIA analyst Maya, played by Jessica Chastain. While she delivers as a determined, even obsessed worker, her character shows minimal emotion like a robot, except for the instances where she flips out over the government's incompetence (which is frequent). It is not until the very last moment of the movie where we finally get to see some reaction other than anger from her. Her character is not well developed or written. With the material she had though, Chastain made it her own. The way she talks back at the dimwitted government officials is amusing (I just hope there are more people like her working in the US agencies). It almost becomes a running gag in which seems to be the only one who is taking her job seriously.The whole famous raiding the compound sequence is a mild disappointment. Shot with bad lighting and unpleasant cuts between night vision and darkness replaces tension and excitement with perplexing confusion. If the entire scene was filled with just the night vision goggles, it would have made it easier to see and know what the hell is going on. 'Zero Dark Thirty' really is all not that great. I don't think it is awful either. I feel people like this movie just because of its topic and not its delivery. In all honesty, I can't help but wonder if Kathryn Bigelow pounced on this project just so she can win two more Oscars. Thankfully, it did not win any big awards. Paul J.N. Ottosson's sound editing was at least a very good win. On a final note, it grew very vexatious to see how stupid the US government employees (at least in this movie) were in terms of their decisions. The words 'Pearl Harbor' ring to mind.",5,1,3,31 July 2013
War of the Worlds," it's nice to see Spielberg back into science-fiction...
","I was never a fan of the creative and unusual author H.G. Wells, but this wonderful depiction of The War of the Worlds, brought to life by the talented and unforgettable Steven Spielberg was truly grand! This is one of the better films this year so far, but this is not the best. It has eye-popping and amazing visuals that should be nominated for an Oscar (I think Star Wars will win though). The film itself was stunningly vivid, scary, intense, captivating, and even bizarre with some of images. The aliens are in fact freaky looking, but if I had to describe them, they are a cross mix between the creatures in Stargate, and what the Queen alien looked like In James cameron's aliens. The story is simple. An averaged man named Ray Ferrier (Cruise) who is divorced and has 2 kids he hardly knows are stuck with him for the weekend. As the average man who is resented by his kids, is involved in a terrible situation of tripod alien ships that are invading earth, which seemed to have been buried under the ground for many centuries before terrorize Earth, showing no mercy. He is forced to protect his own kids, instead of saving the world, like Master chief in Halo, at all cost.I might add that the first action sequence with the tripod rising from the ground was truly a Spielberg masterpiece. So, from here on is all about survival. It is even more amazing how well Spielberg reveals humans selfishness for their own survival, versus working together as a team to live on. Spielberg shows our reactions in deadly situations quite accurately. Anyway, the two hour film was slow in places, but it was full ride, and I actually felt like I was in the movie! it was so freaky, but not as freaky or intense as I hoped, like Aliens. The acting on the otherhand was crap. Especially by Fanning, who screamed the whole time, giving me a headache and Cruise was not a superhero like i expected, (I was never a fan of his, but he has shown himself worthy in acting). the real actor was Tom Robbins, who played a crazed man that lsot everything and wanted vengeance agaisnt the aliens.And I might add that the fairy tale like ending was a bit ridiculous, but still it is worth seeing, and Spielberg has DEFINITELY pulled it off, unlike A.I. or for me Minority Report. Overall rating, 4/5. This is not an invasion, its an extermination-Tim Robbins",8,2,6,2 July 2005
12 Years a Slave," An important film that studies the human condition in order to survive against America's most violent ages
","'12 Years a Slave' follows the story of Soloman Northup, a free African-American abducted and sold into slavery. The movie's center is not so much the journey as it is about the man and his struggles. He faces unimaginable odds and ultimately triumphs after 12 harrowing years. Many words can be used to describe this film. Cruelty, and man's preference to bondage and brutality. Complete despair. Yet hope, compassion, and emotional power. This film is a true experience that is brought to life with bold energy and performances that will burn deeply into your memories.Chiwetel Ejiofor as Soloman Northup delivers the greatest performance of the year. He evokes a man of torment and sadness so perfectly that I could feel his suffering in my soul. He gives us a character that can tell us what he is feeling and thinking without uttering a word--his facial expressions and voiceless body language is that good. Not many thespians can achieve this rare talent. Lupita Nyong'o as his fellow slave Patsy achieves equal acting capacity. I have never seen a character that I felt such pity and sympathy for. She exemplifies the thousands if not millions of persons whose voices have gone unnoticed over the centuries from the inhumanity of slavery. Having won the SAG award, she could very well go on to win the Oscar for supporting actress. Michael Fassbender in contrast does not convey as such a strong or in-depth character as Ejiofor or Nyong'o. He acts more like a three-dimensional villain than an actual believable character. He does play the drunken, psychotic, inhumane slave owner well though.The technical accomplishments are something to admire. Director Steve McQueen relies heavily on extreme close ups on both his actors and to emphasis important details during a sequence. He also utilizes long takes with few cuts, allowing scenes to progress without interruption. The cinematography is pretty decent with its ominous low-key lighting at night and the use of natural lighting during the day shots. The costumes and set pieces, though sparse, help add to the authenticity of the period. Hans Zimmer's score is mainly a two-note, slow-paced melody, exemplifying the passing of time. While simple it is subtle and moving. He does squeeze in some of his loud, bombastic moments. This movie has achieved just about everything I had desired and expected from it, except for one little thing. And that is the movie's focus. I understand the humanizing of Northup, and the cruelties of slavery, but that is all the film really examines. I anticipated more of a recreation of Southern slavery in terms of how they lived, their way of life and daily activities, and how they engaged and coped with the trials of the days. (Note: the book goes more deeply in these regards) Plenty of barbarity is shown in this film. Enough to make the audience members of the theater I attended to gasp and utter the occasional 'On my!' Focusing only on the violence is just one part of the bigger story. I understand that so much can only be covered in a two-hour film, but the cup does not feel full. The ending in particular feels rushed, not giving enough information to view 12 years of a man's life. No matter, this is a very good filmÂ…even a great one. I add it on my Best of 2013 list. However, this is far from the likes of other masterpieces created over the years.",9,5,9,18 January 2014
There Will Be Blood," Best of 2007
","I've only seen Daniel Day-Lewis in three other films and I loved his work in each one of them. Of the four movies I have now seen him in; There Will Be Blood is by far his best one.Daniel Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview. His character starts out as an ordinary man in the late 1800s that is in search of oil. The first fifteen minutes or so of the movie is very interesting for it has no dialog. Rather the film is expressed through the thunderous score by John Greenwood and the actions of a group of men including Daniel who dig deeply into the earth to find oil. With an accidental drop of a heavy metal object, they find their price.The film then swiftly turns to the turn of the twentieth century. Daniel Plainview has become quite a businessman as an entrepreneur of oil. He gets a tip about an earthquake oil in the middle of nowhere. He checks it out and discovers that he has located a new place to expand his oil empire. Persuading the towns' people with the promise of money, he gets them to leave from their land. He then meets his contender; a young man named Ely (Paul Dano) who claims to be a prophet. Ely grabs a hold of the towns' people to follow his church while Plainview digs his wells. Ely then soon learns that Plainview is not going to keep his promise of giving the people their money, but to keep it all for himself. Ultimately, it turns into a game between these two men as Ely turns the people against him and Plainview tries to stabilize his power, wells, and reputation. Daniel's dream of finding oil slowly turns against him as he realizes that he can't get enough of the oil and the wealth it can make him. He slowly passes into madness and becomes a cold-blooded murderer against those who stand in his way, hence the title There Will Be Blood. Daniel Day-Lewis is simply brilliant and nothing short of Oscar worthy. He plays a very frightening character as someone who seeks for riches, but then transforms into someone that anyone would not want to be. He would do anything to get his way, even using his own son H.W. Plainview as a prop to get some sympathy as a 'family man'. He speaks with a dry monotone, but his eyes hold a cold disdain towards others. As he says straightforwardly to one of the main characters in the film, 'I look at people and see nothing worth likingÂ…I don't want anyone else to succeed.' Paul Dano plays two roles in the film. Although neither character is in a scene together, he does an excellent job. He is almost the comic relief as Ely, particularly when gives his sermons that are so corny that make me want to roll over with laughter. I'm surprised Paul kept a straight face in some of his scenes he performed in the film. To me, most movie that are over two and half hours are very long. Well, this movie does not drag one bit; I was engrossed by it from start to finish. Director Paul Thomas Anderson captures the film wonderfully from the distant landscape shots to the intense facial up-closes of the thespians. The works of cinematography, art direction, film and sound editing were all marvelously and worth the Oscars nominations each are given. But the one thing I did not like about this movie was the music. I often felt it drowned the film, particularly in the beginning when Daniel raises his hand up covered with oil. The music was so loud that it reminded me of a tornado alarm going off. Perhaps this was caused by the surround sound in the theater I was in.Otherwise, I was very impressed with this film. I give this a 10/10. This is the best movie I have seen for 2007. -This movie has been nominated for eight academy awards including Best Picture.",10,4,9,26 January 2008
Edge of Tomorrow," The ultimate analogy of Tom CruiseÂ…he can never die
","'Edge of Tomorrow' is the ultimate analogy of Tom Cruise's career. He cannot die. He'll just keep coming back to kick butt in movie screens around the world. The new action hero he plays is Cage, a cowardly military officer that is forced into the front lines against an alien invasion. Lacking any real combat experience, he makes up for it in attaining an ability to relive the same day over and over again simply by dying. The idea is reminiscent of the Billy Murray comedy 'Groundhog's Day.' While a similar concept, the movies are vastly different. An interesting, science-fiction, explanation is given for the reason of the daily recycle. It has something to deal with blood--that's all I can say. With each restart of the day, his character becomes stronger and more equipped to vanquish the aliens. He teams up with Rita, the poster soldier (literally) for killing aliens, and who had once shared the same capability as Cage. The additional cast members are decent. Bill Paxton appears as Sergeant Farrell, an uptight military commander with a short mustache and an even more curt way of saying things. It almost feels out of character for Paxton to play a tough guy. He has developed the reputation of portraying wimps, as seen in every James Cameron movie (going as far back as Aliens). In 'Edge of Tomorrow,' he completely breaks away from this typecast and he does so with stark believability. Brenda Gleeson takes a smaller role as General Brigham. With only two scenes, he instantly gives the impression of a determined military leader. Not many actors have this strength or capacity like Gleeson. While the movie's idea is anything but original, it still is a fun ride for the masses. There is plenty of action, impressive visual effects, and well-timed moments of humor. There is never a bland moment in this film. It is always on the run. The film also proves that Tom Cruise, now at age 52, still has the charm, wit, and agility of being an action star. I can feel and sense that there will be many more years for Tom Cruise as a blockbuster hero. Like with his character Cage, he cannot be killed (figuratively speaking of course).",7,0,2,8 June 2014
American Gangster," Not Ridley's best, but still pretty good 8/10
","I love director Ridley Scott, for his movies blow me away with his creativity and unique movie feats that deliver brilliant stories and top-notched acting such as: Gladiator, Blade Runner, and Black Rain. Since I'm a huge fan of his, surprisingly, I did not like this movie as much as his previous works. Maybe it's because of only seen his major successes. I'm not saying that I don't like 'American Gangster' or think that it is a flop; on the contrary, I actually did enjoy it, but not as much as I hoped I would.The story of the uprising and reign of Frank Lucas was really interested. I am no expert in the history of gangsters nor have I ever heard of Frank Lucas, but the movie really got in deep about his life and how he and his gang got pure heroin, nicknamed 'blue magic' into the U.S. from South East Asia and onto the streets of New York City unnoticed by the government or the police for several years. I almost felt like I was getting a historical education on how dealers in the late 1960s and early 1970s got their drugs produced and sold on the streets.Acting wise, Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe once again prove they are among today's Hollywood finest actors. They shine the screen with their performances as drug dealer and narcotic's detective. It was moving to see how different their character's personalities were, but somehow they were the same. Both were honest in their line of business. Both had violent lives. Both were good at what they did.They aren't in any scenes together until the end of the movie, which really puts their acting skills to the test as their characters finally confront one another for the shocking climax. Now I don't know if they'll get any Oscars or even the nominations for it (since both already have at least one Oscar at home), but it would be fair enough to give either of them the Golden Globe award for Best Actor.On a negative side, this movie is no action flick. There are no car chases and there is only one intense shootout at the end of the film. There are some stakeouts, but they aren't action-oriented. I'm not imply that this movie is boring because it lacks the car chases and numerous shootouts, but it did not have many plots going on or have the speed to make it go by quickly like Scorsese's The Departed.Even though it does not have a boat load of action or an incredibly high body count, nonetheless, Ridley Scott does not shy away from inhumanity. It was violent for me to cringe in a couple of scenes, but it was not as bad as some of other gangster films I have seen. And the foul language wasn't as much as I anticipated. Overall, it was a decent gangster film, but it needed a quicker pace. The two and a half hour film felt longer than three hours for me, and I don't find most movies to be slow. 8/10",8,0,3,18 November 2007
The Mission," An earthly paradise
","'The Mission' is a movie about the events between Spain and Portugal in the 1750s. There's much at stake as one country rules the South American colonies with the purpose to convert the natives and make peace while the other has the view of slave laboring and genocide. They decide to make an agreement; the Spanish sells the colony to the Portuguese putting many natives' lives in danger.Two character's are thrown into the mist of it, a Jesuit priest (Jeremy Irons) whose in construction of building a mission with the natives and a Spanish mercenary (Robert De Niro) who seeks freedom from his past sins. The story contains many controversial topics such as: redemption, salvation, forgiveness, murder, discrimination, peace, and war.The story in my opinion was overall decent, but pretty much anything I have seen, such as: The Last Samurai and Dances with Wolves. Robert De Niro in my opinion is no more than the action hero. I love De Niro's work, but his role in this was nothing as grand as some of his other works with director Martin Scorsese.The real genius was Jeremy Irons. I have only seen him in a handful of movies, but this is by far the one he gave the best performance for. One of the most compelling scenes I found in the whole movie was when he first encounters the natives. He gets surrounded by an army of angry Indians; instead of retaliating he sits calmly on a rock and plays a beautiful tune with his flute, leaving his audience bewildered and tamed from seeking his blood.But the main reason why I give this movie a 9 out of 10 was from its captivating film-making. The shots from the beginning of the waterfalls to the ending passage on the river were amazing. The cinematography by Chris Menges (who won an Oscar for the film) was far by excellent, adding a heavenly feel to the atmosphere. In addition, Ennio Morricone's score not only supported this beautiful vision of an earthly paradise, but it also made it feel real. How he did not get an Oscar for this, is beyond me. I felt like I was pulled into the film, as if I was there. Taking my eyes off the screen was nearly impossible. This is not my favorite film, but it is certainly a wonderful one.",7,1,3,10 February 2008
The Wrestler," Rourke can carry a film with believability
","Professional wrestling. Fake. It is about putting on a show between a good guy and a bad guy. The bad guy often cheats and seems to have the upper hand, but the good guy comes in and scores a victory. The hero is then showered with cheers and applause. Randy 'the Ram' (Mickey Rourke) is such a hero. What's real about professional wrestling is the event and glory that gets both the wrestlers' and fans' hearts' racing. So is the years and injuries. Randy 'the Ram' has been a pro wrestler for nearly 25 years and his age and body is finally catching up to him.The real reality for Randy is that he is past his prime. The film centers on this harsh aspect as well as the struggles he faces outside of the ring. These include trying to build a relationship with his estranged daughter (Rachel Evan Wood), working part-time at a super-market under an unwelcoming boss (Todd Barry), and seeking a friendship with a stripper (Marisa Tomei). To sum up, Randy is quite a lonely man. His only real enjoyment in life is in the ring. For him, that is his reality. This perspective in the story is what makes 'The Wrestler' a good movie. As the viewer, we get to understand Randy, his motives, his pains, and his desires. The success of such a character is clearly through Rourke's performance. Any person can look up Rourke's past life and see that it strongly reflects the character he plays. No doubt this works in his favor. He delivers a fine, honest, subtle, yet real performance. He lives and breathes as Randy on camera (and probably a bit off-camera). That is truly admirable of an actor, and not many can do it so truthfully. Marisa Tomei is the other person who glimmers in the movie. Her character is not so much different than Randy. She is reaching the end of her years for her profession as a stripper and she needs to move on. Unlike Randy, she has reasons and desires to press on to other things after wards. Randy has to live in the moment like a true showman. The interaction between both actors on-camera is fascinating to watch. We get to see them play characters that feel real and down-to-earth. They have excellent chemistry and mesh a unique friendship throughout the movie. The use of hand-held camera work adds authenticity to the film, giving that documentary feel. Unfortunately, this leads to some badly lit night scenes that go on longer than necessary. Overall, Arrenofsky has made a very good movie with wisely chosen actors. I'm not sure if Rourke will ever play a character to the caliber he has done with 'The Wrestler' again, but he has proved that he can carry a film with stark believability.",8,0,0,3 June 2013
Dark Shadows," Dark Shadows feels like a Tim Burton/Johnny Depp flick, yet it does not deliver as one
","I have not seen the TV series 'Dark Shadows' so I cannot make a comparison. What I can say is that this film is very Tim Burton-esque. It is filled with pitch-black nights, fog, haunting scenarios, ghosts, witches, magic, Gothic architecture, a hint of wicked humor, and oddball characters. By the previews, this movie could go no wrong for Burton and Depp have made some very wonderful movies together: Ed Wood, Sweeney Todd, Sleepy Hollow, and Edward Scissorshands to name few. 'Dark Shadows' plot is very simple. In the late 18th century, Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is cursed to an immortal life as a vampire by the witch Angelique (Eva Green) over a case of jealous love. He reawakens in 1972 to find his manor in near ruins as well as his thoroughly dysfunctional, distant family facing bankruptcy. With the help of his very odd and indifferent family, he tries to rebuild his family's name and seek vengeance against Angelique. The performances are great all around in this movie. Each character is given enough screen time to develop both a personality and a desire to be either liked or despised by the audience. Eva Green poses as the great, seductive villainous Angelique that can be hated yet adored by her stunning looks. Chloe Moritz once again plays the bad girl, as the rebellious teen Carolyn. Johnny Lee Miller passes off as the dimwitted dad who is out for himself. Gulliver McGrath plays the creepy little boy David that is only a couple of notches shy of Damien from The Omen. Helena Bonham Carter and Jackie Earle Haley pass off as the wacky drunks Dr. Koffman and Willie that supply some comic relief. The only character that seems to have any sanity in this movie is Elizabeth Collins, portrayed wonderfully by Michelle Pfeifer. Then of course there is Barnabas Collins. Depp does not play Barnabas as over the top as I had seen him as Ed Wood or Sweeney Todd. Instead, he is very subtle in his performance. His mannerisms and fluent delivery of lines gives the feeling that his character is a misunderstood and misplaced outcast, like his work as Edward Scissorhands. He does have his intense moments though.In addition to a solid cast, the sets, costumes, make-up, and SFX make Dark Shadows look like a very nice film. Though 'Dark Shadows' has the cast and production value, it is not that great of a movie. Most of this is because Dark Shadows tries to be funny and scary at the same time. Sure, there are some funny moments, but none of it had me rolling with laugher. Unfortunately, a bit of the humor is on the risquÃ© side, which I did not desire or expect in this film. In regards to horror, the elements are there: ghosts, curses, and witches, but none of it is that frightening. In fact, there are not even any jump moments as a lame effort to be scary. Adding more fuel to the fire, there are also some story flaws. Bits of dialog are thrown in at the final sequence to sheepishly explain some of the back-story that could have been explored much earlier in the film. The biggest problem I had with this movie was the music. Danny Elfman is a wonderful composer, but his music is almost non-existent in this feature. Instead, old 1970 rock songs like 'Nights in White Satin' are played throughout the film's pivotal scenes. I understand that this was used as an attempt to create a nostalgic feeling of the 1970s, but it does not work at all for a Tim Burton flick. I want the magic of Danny Elfmanâ€”not the Moody Blues. Dark Shadows is not a terrible movie. It had a lot of potential, specifically with a solid cast and great production values, but it falls flat on everything else. It feels like a Tim Burton movie, but at the same time it does not.",6,0,2,2 June 2012
Hancock," An enjoyable, fast-paced, 'popcorn-loving' movie
","The movie cost 150 million dollars to make and is only 92 minutes long. Uhm? Either the movie is that good or is another poor investment by Hollywood producers. For what I saw on opening day, it was well worth the admission ticket price. Will Smith as he always is makes a funny, likable, heroic, and believable character Hancock. Ninety minutes of Will Smith can usually make a great movie, but he has some assistance with Oscar-winner Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman. Both thespians help make this an enjoyable movie that adds a little bit of character development and likeness to their characters.As with the rest of the movie, it went into the amazing CGI. Like 'Transformers' and 'War of the Worlds', visual effects have proved to be awe-inspiring and captivating. As unrealistic as the plot and superheroes are, CGI makes it real.'Hancock' is an enjoyable popcorn loving, fast-paced action flick. But there are some things that I did not like in this movie, particularly the prison scenes. I found the prisoners and other criminals throughout the film to be disturbing. Even more so the scene where Hancock stick one inmate's head up another's anus unneeded. It's funny, but it's also something I don't need to see after I had eaten. I liked the movie, but it could have done without some inappropriate scenes as well as some of the violent nature of criminals. I wanted to see a movie that's about escapism, not reality. 7/10",7,2,7,5 July 2008
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," It entertains well, despite its flaws, and there are many.
","The final stretch of The Hobbit Trilogy possesses visual awe, energy, and a darker tone to Peter Jackson's vision of Middle-earth. Picking up directly from his previous film, Jackson grips our attention with an intense CG fire-show, as the dragon Smaug sets the fishing port, Laketown ablaze. The sequence is so fun, that one quickly understands why audience members go see the movies. We can now know why Peter Jackson has forced us to hold our breathe for a whole another year for this big showdown. It was well worth the wait and is a witty method to catch the audience's attention for the first ten minutes of the movie. With the desolation of Smaug being used as an introduction, the remainder of the film centers on its descriptive title, 'The Battle of the Five Armies.' Elves, dwarfs, men, and orcs on a scale that rivals the grand siege of Minas Tirith from 'The Return of the King' face off and battle at the gates of the newly reclaimed city of Erebor. Though there is an abundance of action and subplots that are put to work simultaneously, the essential focus is on Thorin Oakenshield. Richard Armitage in the role as Thorin captures the essence of an individual consumed by greed in a very frightening manner. He becomes paranoid thinking that one of his fellow dwarfs is withholding his precious jewel, the Arkenstone, from him. He barricades the old city from all other races, despite his promise of sharing his wealth with the people of Laketown. He even threatens to kill his own fellow companions if they get in his way. Like the 'Lord of the Rings Trilogy' with Sauron's ring, the Arkenstone corrupts the mind of the hero. Interestingly, Bilbo Baggins takes more of a supporting role. Martin Freeman, who captured so well the transition from a character that was out of his element into a clever protagonist is unfortunately limited in screen time. He is not given a chance to add more depth or significance to the movie. Including 'The Hobbit' in the title is sort of misleading. Only until the end do we think, 'Oh wait! This movie is about Bilbo. Not Thorin.' For a 144-minute movie, the film is quick, but it feels too short in comparison to the other Hobbit films. The ending is particularly rushed and important details that are introduced earlier in the film are either not concluded or are completely disregarded, which as a viewer, made me scratch my head and think, 'Wait? What happens now to this elf character or this dwarf character, or even this human character?' Whether from the studios, time constraints, or just bad editing, the movie does not come off as entirely finished. Scenes of Ryan Gage as the witless Alfrid could have been replaced with much more substantial material. Hopefully the Extended Edition will help resolve these problems. The mightiest flaw that 'The Battle of the Five Armies' faces is the lack of emotional engagement in the characters. Several important good guys die and while their deaths are unpleasant to watch, they never feel sad. The heightened musical score and slow-motion cinematography during these scenes are dull and a clichÃ©d attempt to drive the viewer into an emotional state. It would be easier and more shocking for an important character to die quickly and suddenly versus being drug out like a dramatic opera performance. 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' is not a dreadful movie by any means. Neither is it epic nor is it memorable. It does serve a purpose. It entertains well, despite its flaws, and there are many.",7,2,4,26 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A Magnificent wrap-up for the Star Wars series!
","It was predictable of what would happen, but it was so well done! Lucas'last two films did not do to well for me and many other fans, but this was MAGNIGIFICENT!!! It was slow and dark...yes but that did not hold back its' triumph! The film starts off with a battle over the planet Coruscant (a planet that is one city). The clones, under Obi-wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker send a rescue mission against the droid army, to retrieve the chancellor from being captured by the ruthless Count Dooku. The two Jedi reach the ship of General Greivous, who is the leader of the Trade Federation army, and rescue the Chancellor, leaving Grevious to escape. In my opinion, General Grevious was an o.k. villain, but not as good as Dooku or Vader, but better than Maul. He was evil, but there wasn't much to him (he kept running away like a James Bond villain). Anyway, after these events, Anakin is filled with confused thoughts of love for Padme, who is pregnant with everyone knows who, his friendship with the Chancellor, and his frustration with the Jedi.From his heroic work, Anakin is placed on the Jedi Council as a representative of the republic under the Chancellor, but Anakin does not hold rank of Jedi Master, which angers him, leading him to betray the Jedi. What I like so much about Anakin in this film is how he changes from good to evil. The character development was great. Hayden is truly a wonderful actor. the Phantom Menace lacked this about Anakin. In the episode I, all you saw was a cute little boy that had big dreams. Meanwhile, Obi-wan is on a mission to capture or kill the General Grevious, who has fled to a planet called Uptau. Master Yoda is sent to a planet called Kyassh to help aid the wookies who are in a revolt against the droid armies. (Finally, you see Chewbecca!) As these events unfold, the downfall of the republic begins, leading to disaster after disaster, leading to Yoda to be placed in exile, Obi-wan to leave Luke with his relatives on Tatooine, Leia lives on Alderaan, the Chancellor becomes the absolute dictator of the galaxy, and Anakin is consumed by hatred and anger, leaving him to be the most unforgettable villain in film history...Darth Vader! Truly, a great wrap-up! I doubt this will win any Oscars, but lets' have our fingers cross. This is not the best in the trilogy, but I rank it third of the six films! it has great visuals, fantastic battle and light saber sequences, and strong character development! But take warning for young kids, this film is very dark, disturbing, and more violent/intense than the other films. It is worthwhile, as Lucas finishes his wrap-up of his grand series of sci-fi! Overall 5/5!",9,3,7,21 May 2005
Shooter," A Great action flick!
","Impressed by Mark Wahlberg's role in 'The Departed', in which he was nominated for an Oscar, and with Antoine Fuqua as the director, I immediately chose to see this film. I have nothing to say but high marks about this movie.It had everything an action film needed. It had a great action hero, in which Wahlberg glimmered in. The appearance of Michael Peno as Wahlberg's sidekick was great, but the best performances were the surprising re-arrivals of Danny Glover and Ned Beatty, as the greedy and notorious villains. The other actors, both as the good guys and the bad guys were well-suited in their roles, without a hint of being hokey or wooden.The film also had a strong, flowing story that had no flaw to it, which even held a bit of a moral. The movie also had an Eastwood style to it, along the lines of the 'Spaghetti Westerns', which made the movie better than the average action flick, in which nowadays bases off of Jackie Chan and James Bond films.The action sequences of shoot-outs and car chases were intense and cool, but a bit on the violent side (since Mr. Fuqua is unafraid to show violence from his previous films). The film dragged a little in the middle section, but there are no other complaints I found in the film.As an 'action junkie' I was deeply satisfied. Not the perfect film, but deserves a 9/10!",9,1,4,14 April 2007
Inception," It seems that everything Christopher Nolan touches turns to gold...this is another gold piece
","The trailers that I saw for this movie built it up as another CGI-invested, sci-fi action flick. I'll be honest, I did not know what to expect when stepping into the movie theater. After a fast two and a half hours, I could not even begin to think of what to write about. Following two viewings now, all I have to say is that this is one of Christopher Nolan's most brilliant works, probably his second best behind 'The Dark Knight'. Unlike 'The Dark Knight' however, 'Inception' is not just a pure action flick (there are some great action sequences by the way)-there is a unique plot that really drives the film. As basic as I can explain, 'Inception' explores the idea that people can get into a person's mind and steal his most precious ideas. Don Cobb (Leo Dicaprio) is a master at that, but his new assignment is to do the near impossible, plant a new idea. Similarly to 'The Matrix', Inception's story borders on reality and the dream world, but unlike the Wachowski Brothers feat, this movie disorients both, leaving the viewer to wonder what's real and what's not. That's why I had to see this movie twice. Even after my second viewing, the film leaves the viewer to interpret it all. In addition to the brilliant storyline, which Nolan spent years putting together; the movie has a kick ass cast who all deliver as likable characters, even if they are the thieves. Leo Dicaprio is particular worth noting. Over the years it seems that he has not only become a more versatile actor, but he is able to successfully deliver ambivalent characters that are plagued by a flaw or a sense of guilt from a haunted past. He probably won't receive an Oscar nomination for his role, but as Don Cobb, it marks as one of his best roles. I also love the works of Marion Cottilard and Ellen Page, the two women that try to influence Leo's character. Both don't exchange many lines with one another, but their mannerisms toward each other show the tension that affects the main character deeply. Unfortunately though, Michael Caine does not have a whole lot of screen time. The five minutes he has though reveals himself as the wise old man we've seen in Nolan's Batman films. Pure magic I say. The technical feats are flawless. CGI is nearly a common thread in cinema nowadays, but 'Inception' has more than big explosions. I mean, a city folds itself over like a sheet of cloth! The cinematography, set design/art direction, editing, and sound design are all perfect; especially Hans Zimmer score. Some critics may call it bombastic (it is quite noticeable) but it adds to the dreamlike and disoriented atmosphere that makes up the film's essence. I'll also add that there are a lot of slow-motion techniques, similar to 'The Matrix'. Unlike 'The Matrix' though, it is not used to emphasize kung fu fighting, but to drawl out the effect of time in a dream state. My final notes, 'Inception' is an excellent film, and in my book, goes down as 2010's best movie, thus far. It seems that everything Christopher Nolan touches turns to gold. I just hope that he finally gets the Oscars he so deserves. If you haven't seen this movie yet, get off your butt and go to the nearest theater. ****/****",10,1,6,8 August 2010
Defiance," Not Zwick's nor 2008's best but overall good...
","Edward Zwick is one of my favorite directors because he captures stories brilliantly whether it is about the 54th Massachusetts in 'Glory' or an American in Japan with 'The Last Samurai.' With 'Defiance' he captures a story that I had never heard of during WWII but it makes it interesting. His movies always border on the issues of morals, survival, and emotional melodrama, yet I felt somewhat detached to this film. The acting was good, particularly on Liev Schreiber's part who is absolutely fearless. Daniel Craig also pulls in the best performance of his career. The contrast between the two characters is great to watch. Schreiber's character is driven by vengeance and tactics while Craig's character is more about trying to keep things organized and a strong believer in discipline. The other actors are all right, making good characters, but for some reason I did not care for them as much as I did with the previously mentioned films above by Edward Zwick. I did not feel moved by the movie more or less cried. James Newton Howard's score added some oomph to the film in emotion, but music can only go so far. The movie also kind of developed a stereotype of the Nazis as evil, invaders that 'we do not speak of' that must be avoided in the forest like in Shyamalan's 'The Village'. I was also surprised that this received the R rating. Most of Zwick's films are R rated and for good reasons but this was rather tame. I don't deny the high body count though. I guess it got the rating over Schreiber's occasional f-bombs. Anyway, 'Defiance' is a good film that explores a unique story that maintained my interest for all 2 hours and 17 minutes. It has exceptional performances and some promising action sequences/shootouts, but it does not hold up as one of Zwick's nor 2008's best movies. My rating: *** out of ****",8,2,5,28 January 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Amusing and thoroughly entertaining
","I've never read the original series of 'Sherlock Holmes', so I did not know what to expect walking into the theater. To make things more complicating, I've read reviews that said it was far different than the novels. As an avid moviegoer, I was thoroughly impressed by this movie. There's no boring dialog or voice-over narration that trumps the opening, rather it puts the viewer right into the action, like a James Bond film, and then progresses to a big climax. There is a lot of action in this film, but there's also a lot of mystery in it, like a detective show. Robert Downey Jr., who I've come to appreciate as a decent actor, immerses himself into his character so well that he becomes Holmes. Not the one from the books as fans of the novels would say, but rather his own take on the character. He's sophisticated, smart, and charming, but also one hell of a brawler and a risk taker. Downey Jr. though doesn't make the show alone. Jude Law as his sidekick Watson is also wonderful. He's like Holmes in many aspects, but he's the more organized, and well-groomed hero who doesn't take as many risks. Downey Jr. and Law make a great pair, or as I like to call the new Batman and Robin. The other actors fitted their roles well, but I felt Mark Strong as Lord Blackwood was a weak villain; there was no depth to his character and his motives for why he wants to 'rule the world.' He does have an appearance of a good villain, but he doesn't really deliver as a great one. But what makes up in this loss is the witty plot, which keeps you guessing throughout the film, and at the end throws a sudden, unexpected twist, leaving a cliffhanger for a sequel. The viewer is behind Holmes who pieces everything together, like Patrick Jane in 'The Mentalist'. Adding to the plot is some of the most beautiful sets and costumes, I haven't seen in a long time. In watching the big screen, I felt like I was in London during the late 1800s. Adding to the authenticity of the sets and costumes is the sweat, dirt, and filth that was packed onto the streets and inside the buildings, which gives a taste of poverty that seems long since forgotten in London. The dim lighting, and deep shadows, (as well as excellent camera shots/compositions), gives the film a very dark and mysterious feel to it, like an eerie mystery should. I'll note that Hans Zimmer score however contradicts this tone with an uplifting tune that sounds very much like 'Pirates of the Caribbean.'Overall though, Sherlock Holmes is a witty, fun, dark, mysterious, action-packed, funny, and surprisingly good movie. For you fans of the novel series, put the books aside and enjoy this film!",8,2,7,26 December 2009
WALLÂ·E," The first film that I've given a 10 for 2008
","There are many reasons why I like this movie. For starters, the animation is absolutely amazing. 'Toy Story' may have begun the 3-d animation genre, 'Finding Nemo' may have added more details in the scenery, and 'The Incredibles' may have introduced the retro looking characters. But 'Walle' brings a whole new look at animation. It took only the opening sequence shots of space and the acceleration towards a dusty, abandoned, futuristic, and trashed earth to make me say 'Wow' on how good its animation quality is. The second thing I like about this movie is the characters. Walle, a lonely and curious robot does not say much, but he easily makes a lovable character. His friend and later sidekick Eva is likewise a fun character. It amazes me that it doesn't take a lot of dialog to make enjoyable characters. What was so interesting about these two machines is the friendship and the length they are willing to go to save one another as well as the humans from a total apathetic state. This then leads to the third reason why I like this film, the plot. It may sound too corny or even far from the truth that 800 years from now, we would be living space. However, much of what the social situation that the humans live in is very close to home, for instance: 1.) The earth being a total waste by the lack of care for the environment, by pollution and improper waste disposals. 2.) The humans overweight (with fast food styled meals), busy talking to one another on their screens, and floating in portable chairs. 3.) The heavy reliance on technology and computers rather than doing it ourselves.Does any of this ring a bell? It sounds like us doesn't? Who knows what can happen in 800 or even 10 years. The film is great entertainment with also a grand message. No doubt that 'Walle' will win the Best Animated Film Award for next year's Oscars. It could also very well be nominated or even win for Ben Burtt's wonderful sound and sound effects editing used for all the machines and other characters. I also hope that Thomas Newman gets a win for his wonderful score that sets the emotions in such an excellent movie. 10/10",10,1,2,5 July 2008
The Good Shepherd," A very good spy movie...
","To give a head's up, this is not the James Bond film of where there's shootings, car chases, vodka martinis and gadgets. This film delivers a different and more old-fashioned version of spy films, which is: mystery, deception, manipulation, and murder.After saying that, the film follows the birth of the CIA (Hollywood's version of course). It ranges from the late 1930's to the early 1960s, following one man's life, Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), whom starts off as a graduate from Yale, and ends up being recruited in a new, secret organization, developed by an aging General (Robert De Niro). With the help of his friends, (John Tutorro, Billy Cudrup, and Will Hurt-to name a few) and professor (Michale Gambo) they become the first members of the CIA.It follows them, particularly close with Edward, their journeys from the London air raids in WWII, to the tensions of the Cold War within the U.S., and the Bay of Pigs. With all these events in history, it also holds a romantic story, with Edward's two flames, Laura a simple, friendly deaf woman (Tammy Blanchard), and his later pampered and sensual wife Margaret (Angelina Jolie). The film explores Ed's personal fears and inner turmoils as being an agent who is taken with his job and successful at it, but at the same time has a downslope of a family life, in which he pushes away and lives in fear.To wrap things up, the film was simply a good spy film that covered a lot of detail and background, giving a very authentic feeling and look of the early CIA. De Niro captures the film very well with camera angles that make you feel inside the film, with characters, as well as giving suspenseful and intense moments. Matt Damon delivered a riveting performance as Edward, who is an ordinary man that is concealed with secrets that leads him to paranoia and no trust in anyone, save himself, and is also in tight struggle between family and country, demonstrated very well at the climatic ending. Even more interesting in the film is parallels between religion and government, the 'skulls and bones'. The rest of the cast was great from the large roles like Angelina Jolie and to even the smallest roles in the film, which names I can barely remember. The costumes and set-decoration were great, the score was gripping, and above all, the direction by De Niro reveals that he has a future of being an excellent director. Desptie all of this, there was some damaging flaws.it sounds like the perfect film, but there were two errors that harmed the film. One, it was choppy and very difficult to follow and understand properly. Second, the pace was painstakingly slow, nearly putting me into an unconscious state. Yes, there's not much action, but it doesn't take a lot of action to make a film go by quickly. Save for these flaws, it was a decent film, and among the better films of this year.*** out of **** It's an adult film; message for parents, leave the kids home and see this movie.",8,3,4,27 December 2006
Arrival," Visually awe-inspiring with a profound story
","While most modern-day sci-fi flicks focus on extravagant CG set pieces and mindless destruction, Denis Villeneuve's film 'Arrival' offers the viewer something much more profound and thought-provoking. As twelve canoe-shaped spaceships touch down on earth, linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and scientist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) are recruited by the US government to investigate the purpose of the newly arrived extraterrestrials. The plot focuses on how Banks and Donnelly attempt to communicate with the aliens and understand their mission. Rather than this process being tedious or even boring, screenwriter Eric Heisserer constructs an interesting and well-crafted story, built on mystery, tension and intrigue. As a viewer, I wanted to know about the aliens identity, their mission, and whether humanity will go to war or if a compromise could be made. The tension is astronomically well done. I kept guessing till the end and was pleasantly surprised with the final outcome. The creativity of the alien language and the use of linguistics help make the film even more plausible. Without giving too much away, it is amazing how a simple set of words could easily be misinterpreted or construed. That's one of the several underlying themes of this movie, how people make quick judgments without fully comprehending the meaning of another individual's, or in this case, an aliens' perspective. Language can be a powerful weapon.The visuals and aesthetics of 'Arrival' are simply astounding. The sheer scale of the alien spacecrafts is terrifying and unique. Even though the aliens resemble large cephalopods, they pose as a powerful and foreboding force. Bradford Young's cinematography consists of dimly lit interior rooms, sometimes only lit with computer screens, and overexposed exterior shots. His choice of lighting and camera angles makes the movie feel real, almost like a documentary versus a studio lit scene from a soundstage. But the component I enjoyed the most was the sound design. Some scenes are deathly quiet and then bang, something loud happens. This technique made me feel like I was part of the movie. Johann Johannson's score takes the film's sound to a new level. He conveys something intense, magical, and above out of this world (I hope he wins an Oscar). Max Richter's piece 'On the Nature of Daylight' adds an additional layer of emotion to this great film.The final highlights of what makes 'Arrival' an excellent alien contact movie are the performances. Renner is solid as Donnelly, determined to a find scientific way to communicate with the aliens. It is nice to see him take more dramatic roles rather than playing Hawkeye from 'Marvel's: The Avenger's.' Amy Adams as Dr. Banks could easily receive her sixth Oscar nomination. Her performance is based on subtlety, particularly with her movements and facial expressions. She can express so much emotion without uttering a single word. Instances like these are what can make an actor either really good or bad. Adams is simply wonderful. 2016 still has quite a few movies left to hit the theaters. So far, 'Arrival' is the best one I have seen.",10,12,27,30 November 2016
The Terminal," A little syrupy, but thoroughly enjoyable
","Like in all the other films he's in, Tom Hanks puts a lot of effort into his character. Once again, he proves to be one of Hollywood's most talented actors. I will admit though that his Russian accent was a little ridiculous. The supporting cast also adds diligence to their characters. I feel though that the other great talent came from Stanley Tucci (the potato chip scene he delivers is so darn hilarious) as the security manager. My only complaint though is that the movie seemed to drag a lot, but it did keep my interest. The atmosphere in the movie also is rather syrupy and silly, I mean, the idea of keeping a foreigner stuck in an airport over an incident in his country? Sounds a little far-fetched to me. Other than those few things, 'There terminal' is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.",9,0,2,25 October 2008
Rango," High marks in the animation and voice talent, but it is too long
","This animated feature pretty much has everything that I hoped for when I walked in to the theater. The character design, modeling, lighting, texturing, and animating is flawlessâ€” almost photo realistic while retaining a cartoonish look. Much of the humor is aimed towards parodies of old westerns such as: the Spaghetti Westerns, High Noon, and Once Upon A Time In the West (to name a few). Even music from old Westerns is used, as well as some famous classical music pieces. Sight gags, one-liners, and even the sense of the absurd in some of the animation sequences are all incorporated into the film. The voice talent is simply brilliant. Johnny Depp's voice fits perfectly for the chameleon Rango. Ila Fisher follows through well with a southern accent as the lizard Beans. Abigail Breslin's adorable, young voice provides cuteness as Priscilla the Possum. Ned Beatty and Ray Winstone are great villains, but neither is as up to par as Bill Nighy for Rattlesnake Jake. He did a phenomenal job as Davy Jones in the Pirates films; here he is just awesome. I wish his character had more screen time. Unfortunately though, Rango runs into a big problem, the film moves too slowly. Usually, most animated features are no more than 90 minutes long. When they go past that point, they get boring. In rare cases, features such as 'The Incredibles' move by quickly, regardless of the length. Rango does not have this talent. Part of this problem is due to the plot. The story is simple and nothing really unique, but it goes on way too long. Fifteen minutes needed to be cut. Another thing worth noting is that 'Rango' is not a kid's movie. Though there are some sight gags, the fact it is animated, the humor is aimed more towards people who like the western genre. I grew up watching the old western pictures, so this movie is a real treat. People who are not familiar with the western films may not like this feature. In addition, some of the humor is adult oriented (some of it a bit much for a PG movie). Rango is a very good movie in my book, but it is not a major triumph like past works of DreamWorks and Pixar. My rating: 3.5/4",9,2,4,25 March 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Part avant garde. Part black comedy. Part satire. Part super hero fantasy. All excellent.
","'Birdman: or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance' follows both the actions and the mind of washed-up movie star Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), who is famous for his past role as Birdman. He is introduced in perhaps the most avant garde way imaginable. He floats above the floor in deep meditation as a gruff voice talks, reminding of the mess he is in and that the room he has now called home 'smells of balls.' The voice, like a poisonous Jiminy Cricket, is no other than an extension of Rigganâ€”the Birdman. The line of fantasy and reality is blurred for him. The reality is that he is almost out of cash and his last hope of renewed fame relies on the success of a Broadway play that he's directing, writing, and starring in. His illusions and dreams will always be the fame of the Birdmanâ€”which is what he hopes to break away from. The film shows both him and the audience that reinventing oneself for a comeback is never easy. Right from the start, Riggan loses an actor to a freak accident, which he replaces with an egotistical and unorthodox Method actor (Edward Norton). In every twisted way possible, he causes carnage for both the cast and Riggan. Likewise, his former drug-addicted daughter (Emma Stone) battles him every which way she can. He even has to fight a snobby, stick in the mud play critic (Lindsay Duncan). The only characters that help Riggan are his two female co- stars (Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough), his loyal publicist (Zack Galifanakis), and his supportive ex-wife (Amy Ryan), who sort of becomes the voice of reason. 'Birdman' can easily be interrupted as the iconic role of Michael Keaton. After all, he is most popular for his roles as Batman in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since then, he has more or less vanished from the spotlight. Whether Keaton achieved catharsis or personal reflections in himself as Riggin, none of us can know. However, it is fair to say that this role was meant solely for him. He gives us an honest portrayal of a man who is at wits end to accomplish one last act of remembrance. He brings his flare of humor that has been seen from 'Nightshift' and adds a new element of drama that audiences have never seen in him before. The supporting cast shares their moments of greatness, particularly Norton and Stone. Both of their chemistry on screen lights up sparks. But, it is Keaton who keeps the show moving ahead. Alejandro Inarritu's visual style for this film matches the one Alfred Hitchcock pioneered in the film 'Rope,' using only 7-8 long takes as the camera moves around from one location of the set to another. This gives the audience an incite of the various actions that happen behind-the- scenes of a stage play and it helps propel the story forward in an interesting way. This method of camera work, meticulously and flawlessly crafted by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, creates a feeling of real-life performances, where anything can happen spontaneously. The editing between scenes are carefully done with CG and time lapse effects to help master the seamless camera motions between cuts instead of simply shifting from one moment to the next. The set and production design imitate a grungy, old theater that looks real, almost disproving the notion for the viewer that the film was shot on a sound stage. The technical prowess of this film makes you feel like you really are part of the show. 'Birdman: or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance' is an outstanding film. It breaches the conventional story method and pushes the boundaries on how far a movie can go in terms of visuals and acting. Part avant garde. Part black comedy. Part satire. Part super hero fantasy. All excellent.",10,9,18,16 November 2014
The Big Short," One of this year's best movies!
","Though marketed as a comedy, 'The Big Short' covers some very serious issues. Based off of the book with the same title, the film goes in great depth of the reasons behind the 2008 economic catastrophe. The focus is on a group of individuals that foresee the economic bubble burst and decide to take advantage of it. Among them are a savvy, but socially awkward hedge fund manager (Christian Bale), a short-tempered, no-nonsense trader (Steve Carell), a banker seeking a huge payday (Ryan Gosling) and two young investors that want to make it big (John Margo & Finn Wittrock) â€” who enlist the help of a retired trader (Brad Pitt).The plot jumps from one group of characters to another, covering nearly every angle possible of the behind-the-scenes financial industry that most everyday people do not know or understand. Even though the multiple subplots and some of the technical jargon in the dialog may prove confusing or daunting for the viewer, director Adam McKay and screenwriter Charles Randolph break the subject matter down enough so that the audience can follow along. Often times, they blend humor (such as characters breaking the fourth wall with one- liners or using a chef to explain CDOs) to get their explanations across. The controversial topic that the movie captures is insanely well-written and the actors perform brilliantly in their roles. Christian Bale went so far into his character that he wore the clothing of the man his performance was based on. However, it is Steve Carell who steals the show. With his disheveled hair and East Coast accent, he is unrecognizable. Like with his work in 'Foxcatcher,' Carell once again shows that he can do drama. His character has a lot of passion as he tries to make sense of the impending economic disaster. In a way, he becomes the voice of the viewer, wondering how capitalism can spin so far out of control.The only gripe I have with this movie is the heavy-handed message. Like the 2010 documentary 'Inside Job,' 'The Big Short' paints Wall Street and the banks as the main culprits responsible for the economic ruin. As a result, this gives the audience someone to vilify. Besides this personal opinion, 'The Big Short' is an exceptional film and one of this year's best. I am probably in the minority here, but I think this is better than the new 'Star Wars' movie. It is a film that both entertains and makes you think.",9,3,6,1 January 2016
Prometheus," Dazzling, impressive, unique...it stands out as its own but it's not a classic
","I anticipated that 'Prometheus' was going to be about the xenomorphs that we had seen in the Alien series. Yes, there is a tie in (for this is the prequel), yet 'Prometheus' is not so much about the origin of the xenomorphs. Instead, this film's central plot is the search for the origin of human life. In a similar tradition to Ridley Scott's 1979 'Alien' a group of explorers land on an unknown planet. They search for answers and uncover a mystery that is terrifying and it leads to a race for survival.'Prometheus' is dazzling on the big screen with its awe inspiring special effects, exquisite set pieces, foreboding lighting, and graphic make up design. The story is interesting and it keeps the film going. We learn who our makers are; the movie clearly shows that life is no more than a genetic mutation. However, many questions are still unanswered and it leaves the audience anticipating a sequel. I will note that I have just re-watched the original 'Alien' film and many dots are tied in now.'Prometheus' is really a completely different film from 'Alien' in regards to theme and plot. Even so, I cannot help but compare the two of them. The success in Scott's 1979 film is the terror of the monster, the long moments of silence that suddenly burst into violence, and the strong character developments of Ripley, Dallas, and Parker. 'Prometheus' relies more on its visual style and unique story. This movie simply lacks the fear that we saw more than 30 years ago. In addition, the characters are not given enough time to flesh out. When most of them die, we merely nod our heads, expecting the imminent carnage. I am not saying the cast is bad. In fact, they are good. Michael Fassbender gives a terrific performance as the android David. Idris Elba is particularly amusing as the ship's captain and Charlize Theron plays a good, unbecoming overseer of the expedition project. Noomi Rapace is a decent actress and she is okay as the lead scientist Shaw. However, she does not deliver the intensity that I have seen in Sigourney Weaver. Though 'Prometheus' does not have the horror and characters Scott has been able to deliver in the past, this sci-fi adventure is still impressive. It hurts me that so many people in my theater scoffed at this movie. Then again, most of them were teenagers who do not understand that there are other sci-fi films that do not involve death rays and stuff getting blown up. This feature has left something for me to think aboutÂ…in a good way.",9,2,8,9 June 2012
Halloween," The perspective of a serial killer...true terror
","The film opens with a hand-held, one shot sequence of a person's POV. This person lurks outside a house, watching as a teenage girl makes out with her boyfriend. The individual then runs around the house and enters through an opened back door. Casually, the person walks into the kitchen, retrieves both a butcher's knife and a mask of some sort. As the teenage girl's boyfriend leaves, the person climbs up the stairs, enters a bedroom, and viciously stabs the teenage girl to death. Walking now down the steps into the street, this person is revealed as no more than that of a 6-year old child. This whole opening is about 3 minutes long and it gives us both a perspective and insight to this character, who will be later known for seven films and a cult following. This is Mike Myers. Is he a deranged nutjob or just pure evil? John Carpenter leaves that for us to judge.'Halloween' works so well on many levels for a B-movie horror flick; the types of camera angles, the deep shadows and dimly lit night scenes, and ominous/suspenseful music. 'Halloween' is not just another low-budget slasher film; it established both John Carpenter's and Jamie Lee Curtis's movie careers and it shows wannabe filmmakers what can be done successfully with few actors and little money. Many amateurs have tried and failed miserably at what Carpenter accomplished with this film, but this is only because Carpenter, the auteur that he is, knows how to make a great movie. For 92 minutes, he gives us two strong lead characters, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and Laurie (Curtis) that we enjoy and care for. He knows exactly what specific composition and lighting to use for each scene to set a mood. He knows when to pace the action (When will Myers kill his next victim? He's staring right at her!) He even knows when to cue the sound effects and music to heighten the suspense. The fact that he both directed and scored this film is nothing short of remarkableâ€”the music fuels the film's emotions beyond believe. Who would have thought that a simple walk from home to school could be so eerie, or a murder be even more terrifying? I have seen my fair share of B horror flicks and slashers. 'Halloween' tops them all. For an R movie, it's quite tame in terms of blood and gore, but the fear that the man in the mask instills is more frightening than dismembered bodies or evisceration.",10,1,2,12 February 2013
Despicable Me," A funny, entertaining film...and that is not all
","Being honest, I did not see this feature in theaters because it looked dumb. A short while back, a relative received a copy of it from Netflex and we watched it. It has been two months since I lost saw this movie and I cannot help but keep thinking about it. 'Despicable Me' is almost purely a funny movie. The humor does not just come from the sight gags (particularly from the light bulb shaped minions); it also comes from the ridiculousness of the plot itself. Going even further, the characters have a retro appearance that take me back to days of Pixar's release of The 'Incredibles.' The main character has a bulky figure, but thin legs. The antagonist looks like a nerd from the show 'The Big Bang Theory.' The mad scientist looks like an older Chris Lloyd from 'Back to the Future'. You get where I am going with thisâ€”blatant caricatures. The film even incorporates violence to the point that it is classic slapstick.But what really make this animated feature so good are the story and the emotions it brings to the table. Without giving any of it way, the movie brings up the question: Can a criminal mastermind develop love for orphaned children? There is such strong development and emotions in the characters that they almost brought me to tears. What I am trying to say is, I really care for characters. When I see them happy, I feel happy. When I see them sad, I feel sad. When they are danger, I fear for their lives.This feature really shows that it doesn't take a famous animation studio like Pixar to make a really good animated film. There are two things that bug me about this feature though. For one, the adoption agency is shown in a negative light. This may offend some people, particularly individuals who have been adopted. Second, some of the humor is a bit inappropriate and crude for an animated feature. The Shrek films incorporate fart jokes, no biggie, but 'Despicable Me' includes some innuendos and even a scene where characters scan their butts for amusementâ€”this is unnecessary for a family-oriented animated film. This is a good film, but some of the quirks I listed above drag its score down some. It is obvious that Toy Story 3 would win for Best Animated Feature and it did (rightfully so). However, this should have received an Oscar nomination.My rating: *** out of ****",8,0,0,24 March 2011
Taken 2," They should have left Bryan Mills alone
","'Taken' is a fun movie. It introduced Liam Neeson as an action hero and it shed light on one of Europe's bleakest and most disturbing crimes. 'Taken' also presented itself as a stand-alone movie that did not leave any evidence or room for a sequel. If another Taken were to be made, it would either be a simple rendition of the previous film or something completely different. 'Taken 2' fulfills the former.Following the events of the first film, a father of one of the Albanian traffickers that Bryan Mills (Neeson) tortured and killed seeks vengeance upon him. On vacation with his ex-wife (Famke Jansen) and daughter (Maggie Grace), the Albanians strikeâ€”kidnapping Mills and his ex. For the rest of the movie, it becomes a deadly game as Mills fights to save his family from the Albanians. The story is pretty straightforward and as the audience, we anticipate the outcome. However, we still enjoy the ride as the hero takes on 20 or so bad guys. There are some things that are better in this Taken. For one, there is a solid villain, played well by Croatian actor Rade Serbedzija. He is known in Hollywood as portraying evil Russians and he is up on his game in this movie. Even so, he seems to have more leeway in his performance than any other role I have watched him inâ€”for his character requires a bit more on an emotional level. He is not entirely bad nor is he good; he simply wants to avenge is family, which is understandable. Maggie Grace is given much more screen time and pulls off well as a brave heroine in the face of impending peril and death. There are also some thoroughly entertaining action sequences that seem to dwarf the originalâ€”one particular sequence has Mills and his daughter zooming through Istanbul in a taxi, all the while being pursued by police cars and baddies; narrowly missing death on multiple occasions and wreaking havoc on a city wide scale. 'Taken 2' certainly fulfills the entertainment department, yet it is not as fun as the original. This maybe because the first film is a one of a kind in the action/revenge genre. In my opinion, it is due to Neeson's performance. He was so intense, passionate and meticulous in the first film, that we rooted for him to slaughter the bad guys. Though the same character in 'Taken 2,' he is not as much of a driving force. He seemed a bit distant and a little too complacent, as if he was acting at arms length rather than immersing himself into his character. For me, this is a downer. Director Olivier Megaton runs into the issue of overdoing the hand-held camera. While this can be tastefully done, the videography was a bit a dizzy in most of the hand-to-hand fight scenes. This may have been done to maintain a PG-13 rating and hide Neeson's stunt double, but for an action junkie like myself, it ruins the fun. I like to see gritty fights and not have to be left in a haze of wondering who is getting their face punched or neck broken. 'Taken 2' is not all bad nor is it up there with the original. In all honesty, they should have left Bryan Mills alone.",7,0,1,18 October 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Phenomenal!
","I may have come late in seeing 'Silence of the Lambs' and now seeing it, I can only give high marks of praise.The Acting: I was never really a Jodie Foster fan, but seeing her in this, I was blown away by her acting talent. She was smart, emotional, and I have to say figuratively and literally beautiful as Clarice Stirling. Anthony Hopkins shines the film as one of the best villains in Hollywood history as the cannibal, Hannibal Lector. He was simply brilliant: cunning, intelligent, and cruel. Whenever these two thespians were on camera, even though they were in only a handful of scenes together, they brought the film to life at an engulfing level that made me feel inside the film! The other cast member that was also amazing was Ted Levine, who played the lunatic Buffalo Bill. He also shined the film! The other cast members were also well-suited and believable in their roles.The film-making: This is now doubt Johnathan Demme's best and most memorable film. From the opening shots of following Clarice accomplishing the FBI training grounds, to the intense talks between Dr. Lecter and Clarice, and to the climatic finale in the dark basement of Buffalo Bill's lair, the film pumped my heart and soul with excitement. The haunting score by the famous Howard Shore also added to the suspense.Other remarks: The film flew by with no time for dillydallying like many other films have a tendency of doing, and the story was solid with no plot holes. The editing was a little choppy in the first half hour, but there's no room for complaints there. Overall, this film, I consider is among the best movies ever made. It is not only a physiological thriller, as many believe it is, but it also holds secrets and other genres to its own.'The Silence of the Lambs' is one of my top ten favorite movies. 10/10 If I could, I'd give it an eleven or twelve!",10,1,2,26 March 2007
X-Men: First Class," Potential for redeeming the X-men
","This is the fifth X-men and one may think that 4 following the original are too many. I originally would think this, but X-men First Class redeems the series. Unlike the previous two X-men's, this one is not rushed nor is the CGI the main goal. There is actually a very interesting plot, likable characters, and it is well paced. This X-men is particularly special because it explores how many of the mutants have become the way they were in the other features, such as how Xavier opened up his school and how Magneto and Mystique ended up being villains. The cast is very good. James McAvoy is simply a great actor, and he pulls it off swell as Dr. Xavier. The actor who played Magneto (I can't remember his name) is flawless. He embodies the tortured soul of his character very well. It is inevitable that he becomes a villain, but even so, I still root for him. Jennifer Lawrence is also a nice and a sexy addition as Mystique. Kevin Bacon plays an excellent villainâ€”he needs to be the bad guy more often. I even smiled at the little cameo that Hugh Jackman performed as Wolverineâ€”though it is very short. The story, well, it is purely a work of fiction, but it incorporates some historical events that somehow blend into the film's plot perfectly. The technical aspects are mostly great, but some of the CGI sequences seemed to bother me. One in particular is when a submarine crashes into a beach, destroying a boatload of trees in its path. I don't know why, but it seemed fake to me. Perhaps this is because I am pursuing a potential career in 3d animation and I always tend to analyze the work of the visual effects artists more carefully than most viewers. Then again, the whole premise of mutants living amidst society is a bit silly and cartoonish. Anyway, X-men First Class pretty much summed up my satisfactions of a great, blockbuster hit: acting, story, solid pacing, and mostly decent film-making. If there is another X-men, the writers and filmmakers need to make one with the ingredients I listed above. If this is the last one to be made, Hollywood has made a great close to the series.My rating: 3.5/4",9,0,2,14 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Overall Excellent
","'The Dark Knight Rises' is 2012's most anticipated summer blockbuster. There have been several great movies this year so far and Christopher Nolan's third installment of his Batman trilogy certainly adds to this list. The movie starts eight years after the events of 'The Dark Knight.' Gotham is at peace from crime and Batman is still dehumanized as a villain. Things change when a terrorist named Bane (Tom Hardy) puts forward a horrid plan that unleashes havoc and anarchy into the city. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), now a crippled recluse must rise for a final battle that puts him to the ultimate test, hence the movie title. Each of the Batman films that Nolan has made are a bit different from the other. The first one focused on Wayne becoming Batman. The second one took a darker turn, focusing on the violent action and the mind of a psychopath. This one zeroes in on wrapping everything together and tying up some knots from the first two films. As a result, there is a very effective plot. It does not get in the way of the action scenes, for they are great and plentiful. The climax in particular is fun. However, they are not nearly as long and abundant as 'The Dark Knight' or 'Batman Begins.' This does not hinder the film though. The nearly three-hour film is well paced.Like the other flicks, the acting is thoroughly good. Christian Bale is more fleshed out in this Batman. He is not just an action hero like in 'The Dark Night.' Instead, his character goes through both a physical and mental struggle, like he did in 'Batman Begins.' I did not have much confidence in Anne Hathaway as Cat Woman, yet she is nearly as flexible and seductive as Michelle Pfeifer in 'Batman Returns.' There is a certain element that she lacks though. She does not have as strong of chemistry with Bale as Pfeifer did with Keaton. The way Pfeifer talked and licked her lips (like a cat) as she taunts Batman is flawless. This type of interaction between Bale and Hathaway is non-existent in 'The Dark Night Rises.' Tom Hardy as Bane marks as a great villain. Unlike the Joker from the previous film, he is not a nut case. He is methodicalâ€”he has a feasible objective. He also relies on his brutish nature to crush people's heads and fracture vertebras. The addition of his altered voice through his breathing mask gives him a more menacing persona. At times though, this makes it hard to comprehend his dialog. To say that Bane is a better antagonist than the Joker though is unfair. Both are completely different. The Joker uses his clever wit to try and outdo the superhero. Bane uses his body power and men to overpower the good guys. In regards to the supporting cast, they mesh well into their respective parts. These include: Gary Oldman as the aging Commissioner Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Joseph Gordan-Levitt as the hotheaded, rookie cop Blake, and Michael Caine as an overly sentimental Alfred. The technical pieces of this Batman outdo the other films. There are a lot more special effects and they are very impressive. The set pieces and cinematography add more exquisite layers to the world of Gotham. The score by Hans Zimmer is very prevalent and pushes the viewer into an adrenaline rushing adventure. The 'Bane Chant' alone is simply breathtaking to listen. If I had one criticism, it would be about the sound mixing. In some scenes, particularly the action bits, the music becomes overbearing to the point that it overrides the dialog. I love the music, but it needed to be tone down some. My final words: 'The Dark Knight Rises' is an excellent conclusion to the Batman trilogy. The final moments are especially touching.",10,2,9,20 July 2012
Iron Man," Better than I had expected...
","From all the hype I heard about this film, I decided to see it. I thought this would be another superhero movie disaster that has too much CGI and no plot, but I was proved wrong. Most superhero films don't have an academy award winning script, but 'Iron Man' pulled off with a decent story that has no holes. I was very impressed by it, particularly with a surprising anti-gun/war message delivered nicely by Robert Downey Jr.To my surprise, Downey did a pretty good job as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He's funny, entertaining, and a hero that could easily be liked. Terrence Howard as the amusing Jim Rhodes and Gwyneth Paltrow (beautiful as ever) as Iron Man's assistant are pleasant additions to the film. Jeff Bridges wasn't a bad villain, although I did not find him to be in the caliber of Jack Nicholson as 'The Joker' or even Willem Dafoe as the 'Green Goblin'.The one thing that I did not like about the movie though was the lack of romance. Whether it is Batman or Spider-man, the good guy always had a girl. Gwyneth Paltrow's character can be considered a damsel in distress at the end, but the relationship never grows between her and Iron Man. I'm not trying to sound like I am a lover of chick flicks, but in my opinion, a good superhero should always have a girl, or at least someone to love.Overall this is a great film with a solid plot, decent acting, and wonderful CGI that is not overdone. For you popcorn lovers, this is your ticket. 8/10",8,7,10,16 May 2008
Tombstone," Great performances, but lacked the 'western soul'
","Okay, I'm a 'natural fan' of the western genre, enjoying the likes of Silverado, the Spaghetti westerns, Pale Rider, The Magnificent Seven, and Unforgiven. After seeing all of these, I finally got a chance to sit down and watch 'Tombstone'.The Story: It was a decent, typical tale of an ordinary man, Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russel) and his family including his opium addicted wife, and two brothers Virgil (Sam Elliot) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) decide to live a leisure and peaceful life in the west. But when a band of thieves and ruthless murderers called 'the cowboys' lurk in the town and go about their business 'scott free' of the law, the three brothers and their friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) decide to bring 'law and order'.Now, it sounds all good, but the way the film delivered it was at most the pace of a snail. There was plenty of character development, and intermittent brief tales of each individual, but the entire first hour is made up of this, with only one gun battle in the start, occasional fist fights and one or two, here-and-there murders. The film did not even feel like a western, more like a soap opera as the 'good guys' and 'bad guys' deal with their delusions of obsessive gambling and alcohol intakes, and their lust for using their testosterone. When the first hour ends, the REAL story kicks in with the famous 'shootout at the OK Carrol'.Henceforth comes the gun battles and merciless killing. The action though did not have the exciting camera angles that Sergio Leone had in 'The Good, Bad, and the Ugly', nor did it have an uplifting score as 'The Magnificent Seven'. The action sequences were very stiff and bland, lacking creativity and thrills. Even the 'Ok Corral' sequence was a bit dull and long lasting, in which only three guys were killed in, when it looked like a dozen or so were shot. The violence in this film was brutal and cold-blooded like Spielberg's Schindler's List. Perhaps the director wanted to make a more realistic look at the film (since it was based on a true story), but even by that time, I was numb from sleepiness. Unforgiven did not have as much action, but it flew by! What's up with that?The acting: It was very good. Val Kilmer gave quite a performance as Doc Holliday, with his one-liner clichÃ©s, deep philosophy of life, and armed with his two pistols. Kurt Russel was also very decent as the hero who is drawn between what to do right, and what to do for himself. He performed a very ambivalent character. The other actors were great too, even the villains who were both laughable and insane.Overall: The film had good characters and a decent story, but it lacked the pace. With this movie, do not expect much action till the second half of the film. Critics call this the 'last great western', but that's one fat lie. When I mean it lacked the 'western soul' I mean it lacked the the thrilling action, the music, and the adventurous pace and story. Because of this, it did not feel like a western, at least to me. This is possible, since I'm old-fashioned when it comes to a western film (good vs. bad, saving the damsel in distress stuff). Basically, it does not follow 'the traditional western.' It is an okay film, but it lacks the speed and proper soul of a western. I had to give it some credit since it was based off of true events. 3/5",6,3,5,26 March 2007
Casino Royale," Bond Redeemed!
","The last few bonds were let downs. For sure I thought Bond was over with for good, but when this new bond was relased, it gave a new and refreshed look of Bond! First things first, the new Bond, Daniel Craig, was extremely good. he may be blonde and short, but he has the Bond charm, as well as the skill and talent. Furthermore, he's better than Roger Moore could have ever been, but still, Connery is the maker of Bond.This Bond film follows the rise of Bond as becoming 007. This means that there's no gadgets or Q, and no Moneypenny. The action in this Bond though is more realistic with a lot of shootings and on-foot chases. There is one car chase, but you Bond fans shouldn't be disappoitned, for the action sequences are spectacular and eye-popping! I have to note though that this Bond is nothing like the 1953 book, for it is modern-day, not Cold War, and is action-packed, while the book is not so.Like the book, it does follow Bond's first love Vesper Lynd, played very sensually by Eva Green, who is well suited for the role, follows her betrayal and traegdy.Then there's the villain Le Chiffre, (Mik Maddsen), whom Bond hunts down and encounters him during the famous card-playing scene of poker! This Bond was not only great for it's action, and the new guy, but also because it gives Bond a better and new look of realism and character; it also gives birth to how he forms into an alcoholic,gambler, womenizer, and action hero.Unfortunately, the fun doesn't last forever, despite it's lack of speed in places, but it's for sure that there will be a sequel that pick up after this one.Overall ***1/2 out of **** If you are a Bond fan, this is the Bond you have been waiting for!",9,1,2,26 November 2006
Toy Story 3," Toy Story 3 is funny, action-packed, suspenseful, and for some, it will bring tears.
","Like millions of others, I was a little kid when I saw the first 'Toy Story' in theaters. I loved it. A few years later, I saw the second one, and I was not impressed. I did not plan to see this movie for I believe that every great original follows terrible sequels. With friends who kept telling me to see this movie, I finally gave in. I just finished watching it and I was blown away. I should say that 3d animation films have become a common thing, yet somehow the animation seems to be getting better and better. As a student pursuing a potential career in 3d modeling, I was flabbergasted by not only the detail in all of the characters but also how the animators added personality to them in their walks, mannerisms, and specifically with their facial expressions. This movie probably would not have been possible back in the release of the original 'Toy Story'. The characters are easy to love (and some are easy to despise) and the voice talent is superbâ€”I can never get tired of the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. But what I really love about this animated feature is the story. To sum it up briefly, Andy is going away to college and the toys accidentally end up in a daycare, which is hell in a handbag. The remainder of the story is made up of them trying to get back home. It sounds simple enough for an animated film, but like the last two films done by Pixar, there is an underlying, emotional feel beneath it.Watching this movie, I can't help but think back to my childhoodâ€”playing with my toys, letting my imagination run wild. This movie brings back old memoriesâ€”as it does with the character Andy. I can relate a lot to his character, and at the very end (not trying to give too much away), he passes the mantel on to another child. For the first time with an animated feature, I actually cried. Not with sadness, but with an inner happiness. Like Andy, I can never go back to my childhood. This film has also fueled my imagination to continue my goal into getting a career 3d modeling.Pixar has made another triumphant feature. Toy Story 3 is funny, action-packed, suspenseful, and for some, it will bring tears. Who thought that toys could bring tears? Apparently this is the magic of Pixar.4/4",10,1,1,17 October 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Each Ice Age seems to be getting better and better...
","The first 'Ice Age' was good but a bit depressing. The second one made me laugh so hard that I almost fell out of my seat. This one did not only supply witty humor but has some brilliant, awe-inspiring action sequences for a feature-length animated film. They are every bit as good as 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' and that's saying a lot. Watching this film on the big screen is a real treat. The voice cast did an exceptional job but the real genius was Simon Pegg as the adventurous, and somewhat crazy Buck. Though he makes some good Johnny Depp impersonations of Captain Jack Sparrow with his voice, he still makes a character in it of himself. He made more of the film than any of the other characters. I'll admit though that Scrat, the squirrel who can't get his nut, has his moments, constantly pursing his new competition Scratte. Surprisingly, the two squirrels fall in love, but their love affair has a predictable ending. Now having seen this film, it makes me wonder if a male and a female squirrel would fight each other over a nut like Scrat and Scratte do. Mmm? Each 'Ice Age' seems to be getting better and better with each new release. 'Ice Age: Dawn of Dinosaurs' is an animated film that I think the whole family could enjoy, but it seems more aimed toward the adult audience in some of its humor, which is wasted on the kids since they don't understand it.",8,1,3,2 August 2009
La Vie En Rose," A film in which the actress becomes the star...
","'La Vein Rose' took home two academy awards in 2008. One for make up and the other for Best Actress. I was disappointed in the Academy that year, because all of the acting awards were given to non-American actors and with the fact that they keep nominating movies that I either (a) I can't find in theaters or (b) never heard of. I never heard of 'La Vein Rose' until I saw the academy awards that night. And I've never heard of Marion Cotillard. Now that it's on DVD, and finally available at the library, I checked it out along with 'A Very Long Engagement' another film that Marion Cotillard is in. I've seen her in three movies now, this marking the most recent. When I started watching this film, I was captivated by the brilliant camera cues and splendid work of the cinematographer. In addition, the voice of the real Edith Piaf brings a sense of joy to my ears. The first two acts are interesting, developing Edith's disturbing childhood and cutting between her as an old lady, delivering one drunken bout after another, yet I was still intrigued. Flying into the third act, the movie gets very interesting. From the director's point of view, it seems that Edith was a poster for abuse. Her parents neglected her and her so-called 'friends' treated her like a piece of 'dog wet meat'. But I'm still intrigued. I've seen many movies and many great performances. Not many female lead performances touch my heart, however, Cotillard has a magic about that.Her work reminded me very much of John Hurt's as the 'Elephant Man' in the aspect that she is covered in gallons of make up and limps around, but underneath all of that self-pity and despair is a person. Her eyes tell so much about her character. I love her, yet I pity her. She's charming but also cruel. In it of themselves her eyes tell a story. What I'm trying to say is that I did not see an actress at work. I see a character, a person who was real. That's what I call brilliant acting.Being a drunken drug abuser, singer, and limping around is easy to do, but Cotillard is not all about imitations. She becomes the character. When she smiles, I smile. When she cries, my heart sinks. Cotillard's work is pure genius. I don't like it when the academy decides to give all the awards to foreign films, but Cotillard's Oscar was very well deserved. I will go so far as to say that her performance is not only a personal favorite of mine but also among the best a woman has ever delivered. The technical work for this film is also desirable, but Cotillard makes the film. 'La Vein Rose' is far from a favorite film of mine, but again, Cotillard's performance will be one I'll never forget it.My rating: ***1/2 out of ****",9,2,5,3 July 2009
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Apart from the artwork and Miss Blanchett...it is nothing spectacular
","With an exciting historical topic and a very influential all-star cast including Oscar winners Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush, this movie looked like the next grand epic since Kenneth Braughn's 'King Henry V'. Despite the many negative reviews I have read, I still wanted to see this movie. I usually agree with most film critics, and unfortunately I have to agree with them one this one. 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' could have been a spectacular achievement, but it falls short on almost everything of which makes a historically epic movie.The first hour of the film was nothing more than men trying to woo pretty ladies of Queen Elizabeth's court. The movie felt like a chick flick. The acting is even drier in this section of the movie. Clive Owen is no more than a chick magnet and a typical action hero, and Geoffrey Rush seemed bored with the movie itself, and just went with the flow, following Blanchett's lead. Miss Blanchett though seemed to enjoy herself, bossing everyone around as queen, wearing pretty costumes and make up, and getting all emotional over every little detail; she would be happy in one scene and totally mad in the next. I have to admit though that this made her quite an ambivalent characterIn the midst of all this, the movie tries to develop a conspiracy in which one of the Queen's distant relatives wants to assassinate her. This conspiracy is hard to follow; no names are given, so I don't know who is who, much less who ends up murdered and why. When this conspiracy quelled, the remaining hour is made of a wannabe action flick. For no apparent reason, the King of Spain, who is no more than an annoying figurehead that jabbers quickly in Spanish, wants to take over England. This then leads to the big, epic battle in the North Sea. It takes forever to get to this sequence, and then it delivers as one of the most boring battle scenes I have ever seen. There's not enough explosions, death, and fighting to make it enjoyable. As far as my history goes, the naval battle in the North Sea was among the grandest and largest battles in world history. There are a lot of ships present, but there's not much happening with them. When this is all over, the movie wraps up with a happily ever after ending. I may sound that I absolutely loathe this movie, but I don't. This film had some of the most beautiful cinematography and costume designs that I have seen since 'The Curse of the Golden Flower.' The set production and make up design was also as equally amazing to look at. And the score was very pretty, although it was a bit bombastic in the start and end of the film, occasionally overriding the dialogue. It's not the worst movie I have seen, but it is certainly not the best. From the elegant artwork and the 'ambivalent' performance by Miss Blanchett, I give this a 4/10.",4,4,5,3 November 2007
Beowulf," A huge let down on all aspects of what makes an epic tale
","Beowulf is among the greatest and most well-known epic tales of Norse Mythology, but it only took me five minutes into the movie to realize that this film was not even close to as something grand. Why? To my surprise and disappointment, this movie was animated. Sure, animation isn't a big deal for a film along the lines of Shrek or Ratatouille, but not for a story like Beowulf. Beowulf is a very serious tale that covers many topics such as vengeance and forgiveness, cruelty and mercy, curses and revelations. I admit, this movie has some of those aspects, but it rather focuses on a corny, stylish animation work.The action and animation itself reminded me of a teen-rated video game rather than a masterwork. However, there were a couple of scenes in the movie of which some of the up closes of the actor's face in certain scenes look real rather than animated, particularly in the scene of where Beowulf encounters Grendel's mother. I don't know if this was digitized or not, but either way, I felt like I was brought back to a normal film in these scenes versus a silly cartoon.As with the story, rather than beginning with King Hrothgar murdering Grendel's father, it opens with the King having a party of drunkenness and very inappropriate nudity, particularly for an animation film. Then the party is suddenly raided by the giant Grendel. After this raid, which is quite bloody (especially for an animated film) and long ends Beowulf is finally introduced.Now, the movie does not explain why Grendel keeps attacking Hrothgar. In the myth, it was because he was responsible for Grendel's father's death. There is no sign or even an implication of this. As for Grendel, well all I can say is he looks like a giant mummy from The Mummy Returns and loves to yell at the top of his lungs. I felt no pain for him, rather an urge to say, 'Shut your gull!' I don't want to even bother in trying to explain the rest of the story. It is mainly a combination of Beowulf's two great tales smashed together in under a two hour film.Since the story wasn't really developed well, the actors did not have much breathing room to really act. The monsters were evil and the good guys were heroes. Ray Winstone as Beowulf is pretty much like Gerard Butler was as King Leonardis from 300. He has a muscle-bound figure, loves to kill things, occasionally tries to be civil in politics, loves to walk around butt naked and shout drunkenly, 'I am Beowulf!' I can't help but think of, 'This is SPARTA!' Anthony Hopkins, as great an actor as he is, is an old, senile, drunken fool who can't stride from one chair to the next. Angelina Jolie, well, she's Angelina Jolie. She has a great body and speaks smoothly with her accent from Alexander. There's nothing worthwhile in this film, just a wasted epic that relies too much on the CGI department and has vivid images of sex and violence. I'm even more surprised that the great director Robert Zemechis of Back to the Future and Forrest Gump would direct this garbage.-1/10 I wish I can get my money back.",1,48,80,24 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Yippee-ki-yay!
","I have grown up with the 'Die Hard' films. Seeing a new, modern-day version of 'Die Hard' is fantastic. Bruce Willis once again is the charismatic John McClane whose life motto 'at the wrong place at the wrong time' fights against a technological-driven terrorist organization who is more interested in hacking into the government files rather than blowing buildings up or holding hostages like the original three. As an 'old-fashioned' hero, his sidekick is a hacker freak named Mathew Farrell, wonderfully played by Justin Long. And McClane's new arch enemy is Thomas Gabriel (Matt Olyphant), an overconfident and evil-mannered manipulator.This unusual difference from the usual 'Die Hard' villains' scheme does not dishearten the Die Hard spirit at all. In fact, it makes the movie all the more interesting, supported by intense CGI effects, which delivers cool action sequences of car chases, shoot-outs, and countless explosions. The visual effects are not overdone; they look very realistic rather than being cheesy. There is also a fair amount of great stunts in the midst of all the non-stop action. There are no complaints in that field.And it is no mistake that this is a PG-13. I was surprised when the rating came out, since the other ones were R's. This means the violence is toned done and McClane does not deliver his F-bombs. But he still manages to get his famous 'Yippee-ki-yay' in it. As a Die Hard fan, I was very impressed. The first one and third one though are still the two best ones. 9/10 So, 'Yippee-ki-yay!'",9,4,7,7 July 2007
Thor: The Dark World," Not as Character driven, but it makes up with better action sequences
","'Thor: The Dark World' does not so much pick up on the events following its predecessor for it tells its own separate story. The focus is on another old enemy of Asgaard, the Dark Elves who possess a long since lost artifact called the Eatherâ€”which grants virtually indestructible power to a living host. While Thor brings peace and attempts to unite the 9 worlds of the universe, the Dark Elves arise and plan to blanket everything in darkness. Breaking away from a simple rehashing of the first film's plot is refreshing and advantageous, for it introduces a new perspective of this universe that non-Marvel Comic savvy persons like myself are unfamiliar with. At the same time, the movie retains all the characters and their personalities from the previous flickâ€”Thor, Jane Foster, Dr. Selvig, Odin, Frigga, Heimdall, and even the science intern Darcy and Loki.New faces are added too. Jonathan Howard plays the intern's intern Ian. And Chris Eccleston plays Malekithâ€”the leader of the Dark Elves. Both are effective in their roles, however, their purpose to the overall story is rather vague. Ian is pretty much a sidekick of sorts, but he doesn't really achieve much as a character, other than flipping a car on some dark elves and making out with one of the girls. The motives for the Malekith character are left unanswered. So he is a villain who wants to rule the universe. Okay. Why? Revenge? Insanity? There is no explanation. The only conclusion I can come up with is from him floating around in space hibernation for 5,000 years. I guess the solitude finally got to him. More meaningless actions brought questions to my mind during the film's progression, such as why the Asgaardian soldiers brought spears and shields to a laser rifle fight or how F-18s suddenly appear to try and destroy the enemy spaceship on earth. I'm probably taking this film too seriously when a movie such as this is anything but that. Nevertheless, some plausibility has to be present in order to suspend the viewer's disbelief. Unfortunately, this movie fails a bit here. More amusing is how the movie tries to be technical and intelligent about the sciences behind the Eather, the space portals, and the 'convergence' between the different planets. Science fiction is fun but it needs limitations for the viewers' sake. What does make 'Thor 2' memorable though is the action sequences. They are abundant, long, gigantic in scale, and over the top entertaining. The Dark Elves onslaught against Asgaard is particularly fascinating to watch on the big screen. I enjoyed myself despite its ridiculousness and I can never resist the charms of the cast, especially Stellen Skaarsgard as the crazier than average Dr. Selvig, Kat Dennings as the quirky Darcy, Natalie Portman as the adorable Jane Foster, and Tom Hiddleston as the deceptive Loki. I also liked that Stan Lee and Chris Evans deliver minor comedic cameos. Characters and action is what this kind of movie needs and 'Thor 2' has both. Too bad it is not nearly as character driven as the original Thor, but the ending makes up a little with a good twist. So pay close attention.",7,0,1,15 December 2013
RED," A fun, entertaining, suspenseful, funny action movie that is driven by great, enjoyable characters
","If I had to sum up this movie in one sentence, it would be a fun, entertaining, suspenseful, funny action movie that is driven by great, enjoyable characters. Sure, there's an all-star cast: Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren, but every one of them makes a character of his/her own. Willis, whom over the years has come across as a seemingly ordinary guy, but when messed with, he comes off as a tough, no nonsense, clichÃ© one-liner hero. He follows this formula perfectly. His initial appearance is a quiet, simple, lonely middle-aged guy who lives in suburbia. Everything he does is routineâ€”he wakes up at 6 a.m., works out in his basement, eats breakfast, you get the picture. But when his idyllic home is blown to hell (literally) from mysterious men in black outfits, armed to the teeth with machine guns, he reveals himself as a gifted fighter and marksmenâ€”the old Bruce Willis is back and better than ever. If you're looking for humor, look no further than John Malkovich. He often plays nutty roles, and this is one of his best. His character paranoid and somewhat delusional, but he holds a charm that makes him probably the most lovable character in this film. His delivery of lines is priceless and the demeanor he carries for his role is perfect. Perhaps he can get an Oscar nomination for his role (maybe unlikely, but I sure hope so). Morgan Freeman (whom I never thought of as an action hero) holds himself as the old wise man that he always portrays in movies. But beneath the age, he always has a card up his sleeve in case of a deadly situation. Helen Mirren is the similar, but she has a taste for the dangerous, always wielding a gun of some sortÂ…just in case. And for someone her age, she is gorgeous. Other great roles are delivered by Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfus, Karl Urban, Mary Louise-Parker (whom I've never seen before), as well as multiple others. The editing, sound, music, camera work, and lighting are all flawless. The pace is moderate. The 1 hour and 51 minutes did not fly by, but I wasn't bored at all. The story was mostly good, but it could've been better, then again, it's an action flick. Story is not the main goal. For an action flick, this movie has it all. Humor. Explosions. Gunfire. Even a brutal martial arts fight and a sense of the ridiculous. And once again, brilliant characters. 3.5/4",9,1,2,1 November 2010
Unbroken," Everything looks great but it is still missing something
","'Unbroken' is the story of Louis Zamperini. The events of his life are beyond unbelievable and present the vision of a great bio-picture. Growing up in the poor slums of New York as an Italian-American, Louis participated in the 5,000 meter race at the 1936 Munich Olympic Games, fought as a bombardier in World War II, crashed landed in the Pacific Ocean only to be captured by the Japanese navy, where he spent two years as POW under the ruthless supervision of a Corporal Watanabe. There are so many fascinating components of his life that no wonder Angelina Jolie chose to shoot a film about him. The under dog story of his success, his defiance against both death and the brutality of the Japanese are the makings of an Oscar bait bio-pic. What I really liked about 'Unbroken' is how Jolie depicts Louis with the dignity and respect of a newly found iconic figure and war veteran. There are times where he seems to be displayed as almost a perfect, god-like individual. He is but a man, yet the movie makes him more than that. Great legends and stories are often molded from such feats of humanity. Jolie has also surrounded herself with some of the best geniuses in the business. The Coen Brothers wrote the script. Roger Deakins captured the cinematography. Alexandre Desplat composed the musical score. Nothing could potentially weight this movie down with such a great team. While technically sound and backed with an intriguing character, 'Unbroken' fails to engage me on an emotional level. Never do I really feel like applauding or rooting for the hero. I never feel like crying over his hardships or his loss of friends from the war. There is no 'oomph,' nor is there really any soul in the film. It is almost as if simply because we see Louis achieve greatness we are supposed to feel empathy for his character. Though I applaud the real man for how he had triumphed, I cannot do the same with Jack O'Connel in the pivotal role. His acting is quite flat and uninspiring. The other characters feel more like caricatures of the time versus actual people. There's the evil Japanese corporal who has it out for Louis. There is the friend who is weaker in will that relies on Louis to survive. There's the older brother who helped guide his life. There is his dad who wants to keep the family united. There is the mother who does nothing but cry when she is on camera. Get the picture? All one-dimensional personalities. The story structure does not help much either. The bulk of the plot centers on Louis's World War II experience, with intermittent flashbacks of his childhood and career as an athlete. Any one part of his life can be turned into a solid feature. Cramming it all in together is okay, but it suppresses other details of his life. In fact, the film ends abruptly as he returns home from WWII. His journey back home is just as important as the other parts of his life. Then again, only so much can be covered in a feature film. When it exceeds the 2.5 hour mark, it gets dull. Fortunately, 'Unbroken' is not a boring movie by any means. It just takes certain parts of his life precedent over other ones. I am sad that Louis Zamperini did not live to see the final product. I am sure he would have felt some catharsis and personal self-reflection if he had viewed this film. 'Unbroken' is not a bad effort by Jolie and her team. It's just not the masterpiece that it could have been.",7,3,11,30 December 2014
Kagemusha," Kurosawa in color!
","I have to admit, I'm a natural fan of Akira Kurosawa; seeing a film of his in color is simply amazing. With color, Kurosawa had the ability to create imagery and crafty art that was vivid and beautiful; good enough to tell a story through his images.After saying that, master filmmaker Kurosawa's tale is about a thief (Tatsuya Nakadai) who is hired as the role of the king of the Takeda clan, after the king is killed. The film follows his personal, inner struggles as maintaining the role of a king, which is demonstrated very well by Mr. Nakadai. One of the best lines he delivers is 'I'm not a puppet!' there are countless others as well, revealing his pains from living a life of bitterness and misery, into a life of luxury and comfort.During his reign, other major clans decide an all-out war against one another, which causes the peace to falter in the lands of feudal Japan, and puts this thief to the test as being a rightful ruler. Additional to this, the director explores the change from old traditions and customs to modernization (premonitions of the Last Samurai), in which leads to the downfall of the old clans, and into the rise of the new clans.Once again, Kurosawa has created another astounding film that explores: philosophy, reality vs. illusion, war, and ambivalence. the supply of Japanese actors were all great, specifically with Tatsuya Nakadai. The set-decoration and costumes were beautiful, the cinematography is vivid with color, and the music score is both haunting and triumphant.However, the pace of the film was a roller-coaster. In some places it gets fast and in others it drags. Another thing to note is that the action sequences in the film are relatively 'weak.' The battles were long, but were mainly off-camera or implied, lacking the excitement and action needed for a real battle scene. Particulalry with the ending battle. There are hundreds of extras on horse and foot charging towards an infantry line, and the camera pans away from the battle, and all there is, is gunfire and screaming. And in a siege, again, off-camera, and the way it is filmed, it looked rather hokey, showing the actors and fighters on a sound stage rather than a battle field.Maybe I'm just used to his action films like 'Seven Samurai' or even 'Ran', but his battles were feeble compared to his past films. This was a let-down to some degree, but this was still a decent film. Because of this, I rate it a ***1/2 out of **** It's not his best, but a creative piece of work!",9,1,5,6 January 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A Phenomenal Achievement!
","The first two Lord of the Rings films were: enchanting, moving, astonishing, and above all spectacular. Peter Jackson delivers the third and final chapter to Lord of the Rings trilogy with a phenomenal closing! The film has it all from a great, believable story to the high film-making quality, and it contains a powerful cast.The story: The film picks up on the events from the second film. It follows the hobbits rodo and Sam, who are guided by the cursed creature Gollum, who leads them to either the depths of Mount doom to destroy the evil ring, or to their demise. During this expedition, Middle-earth may have won their first victory over evilness, but the armies of Mordor, beyond count, march to the last defense of middle-earth, the city of Gondor, in which the Wizard Gandalf the White must defend, and Aragorn the Dunedain Ranger must become the new king of his people, and lead them to salvation. These two prime stories are captured amazingly, showing who will be saved and who will be sacrificed, particularly the Frodo and Sam relationship, which is strained by the wickedness of the one ring.The film-making: Once again, Peter Jackson provides us with spectacular and unusual camera angles (the left to right technique), as well as bringing to life with eye-popping and 'ahead of its time' visual effects. The CGI effects are used for both enhancement of the cities and structures of the settings, additional to the marvelous production and costume design and the epic battle sequences, in which armies, of thousands of both man and beast clash, astonishingly on the screen, giving ferocious intensity and thrills. Along with this, Howard Shore delivers another powerful and uplifting score.The acting: The acting was magnificent. Especially with Sir Ian McKellan is just well-suited and fabulous as Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen, Hugo Weaving, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, and John Noble to name a few are all likewise well-fitted and 'believable' in their roles (most movies nowadays have very unbelievable actors). But the single best perofrmance is by Sean Astin. He gives a gripping performance as Frodo's friend Sam, who does anything and everything in his power to protect and help him destroy the wickedness that tears his friend apart. the line that he delivered that was tear-wrenching was 'I can't carry it (the ring) for you, but I can carry you!' This movie, (as stated before) has everything. The director's cut only broadens the film and makes it even more enjoyable. Unfortunately the entertainment doesn't last forever, for when the film ends, you'll be begging for more. Although, some folk have criticized its length, but there is much covered in the three hour and twenty minute film. (it is pointless to complain about the pace)Overall rating 4/4 It deserved all the 11 academy awards it won, is the best of the trilogy, and is among my favorites of movies!",10,1,3,6 January 2007
Munich," Violence is what makes us lose our souls as well as our minds...
","'Did we accomplish anything at all? Every man we killed has been replaced by worse.' The lead character Avner (Eric Bana) makes this statement at the end of this thoroughly engaging film. This phrase relates to the basis of the war that has gone on for nearly a century between Palestine and Israel. In part, it also relates to this movie. Based off of George Jonas's novel 'Vengeance,' 'Munich' explores one of the Israeli teams assigned to take out the 11 masterminds behind the 1972 Olympic Massacre. Like the book, the story is seen through the eyes of Avner, the head of this Israeli team.When approached by Golda Meir for his assignment, he is at first reluctant. He eventually signs up, feeling it is his duty to serve his people. He also needs the money to support his very pregnant wife. When he and his team track down their first target, he at first hesitates and then kills him. After this first hit, the violence almost becomes second natureâ€”more and more people die. It is not until Avner starts losing people that paranoia starts to infest inside him and his inner self begins to deteriorate. This is particularly reinforced with only bits of information of the Munich massacre being shown at a time throughout the film. This eventually builds into a final climax on how the violence has turned him into a target as well as disturbs him. Among the most important scenes in the film is when one of Avner friends informs him, 'We are supposed to be righteous. That's a beautiful thing. And we're losing it. If I lose that, that's everything. That's my soul.' This goes back to the meaning of Avner's line at the end of the film. What had they accomplished in killing 7 men? Only more and much worse people will take over, and it is at the expense of his friends and his soul. This message alone is what makes 'Munich' such an excellent film. I have read George Jonas's novel and it is one of my favorite reads. It is written like a documentary, but it reads as an espionage thriller. In the film 'Munich,' the use of archive footage on TV sets, a dramatization of the horrific events, and even the use of hand-held in the heat of the action attest to a gritty, accurate take of the novel. Simultaneously, Spielberg and his team master a breathtaking feat full of thrills and violence. Janusz Kaminski's grim and de- saturated color schemes create an ominous mood. John Williams heart-pounding and occasionally sorrowful score adds additional elements of emotion. The sets and costumes assist in making a realistic look of the 70s in Europe, America, and the Middle East. Michael Kahn's style of editing creates tension within the story and helps push it forward with perfect execution. To add more positives, this film has a great supporting cast, which includes: Geoffrey Rush, Cirian Hinds, Daniel Craig, and Michael Lonsdale. The real magic though falls on Eric Bana. I never imagined him as a lead. Even so, he embodies the Avner character well. Much of this is accomplished through his non-verbal cues. One scene that stands out is when he tears a room apart, looking for any potential bombs or booby traps. You can tell this man is not only paranoid, but is afraid of dyingâ€”just like the rest of us. 'Munch' was nominated for 5 Academy Awards including Picture and Director in 2006. It did not win any of them. There was a lot of competition that year. In my opinion, 'Munich' is one of the most deserving of movies in '06. It is engaging, powerful, intense, and extremely violent. Forty years after these events, Israel and Palestine still has not learned anything. It has been privilege to finally see this movie.",10,1,1,3 July 2012
The Truman Show," This is one of those inventively original films that pushes creativity to whole new level
","There are many entertaining films. Fewer are great ones. Even fewer are ones that are memorable and push the limit in terms of inventive creativity and pure originality. 'The Truman Show' is such a tour de force. It is a film that is hard to describe. It is not quite a comedy though it is funny. Neither is it a drama though there are dramatic elements to it. 'The Truman Show' can be a genre of its own: fantasy, science-fiction, comedy, drama, adventure, thriller--all fit into this movie. It is that unique. As a feeble attempt to explain the plot, this movie is about a man who lives a seemingly ordinary, middle-class life in suburbia, who happens to be filmed from every angle imaginable. The catch, he does not know about it. As bizarre factors begin to take place, he starts to question his identity and life around him. Like the millions of viewers who turn in to see Mr. Truman, we too are fascinated as to what he does next and 'how it will end.' Jim Carrey as Truman turns in perhaps his greatest performance (although Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was pretty good too). His trademark humor is left out and he becomes this individual trapped in a world that is beyond his control. The supporting cast is very solid, particularly Ed Harris as Christoph, the man behind the curtain so to speak. However, it is Carrey who steals the show, I mean, it is about him after all. Besides the acting, Peter Weir's direction is sublime, the visual effects are impressive, the editing is well-paced, and the score is simply astounding. If I had to make one criticism about the movie, that is its abrupt ending. That aside, I consider 'The Truman Show' to be one of the most creative films ever made and one of my favorites. Way better than 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Shakespeare in Love.'",10,0,1,14 July 2013
The Matrix," An eye-popping experience!
","Most sci-fi films over the years have been the same: good vs. evil, space, monsters, etc. But The Matrix gives a mix of none of that. It's simple why the Matrix is considered among the best sci-fi films ever made. It defies the ordinary science fiction film, turning it into something out of this world. It is a combination of kung fu (martial arts) styled fighting, shootouts, future controversy of Artificial Intelligence, and amazing visual effects. With this combination, the film is impenetrable.It is loaded with non-stop action, contains a great storyline, and has some of the best and highly unusual camera angles ever used in modern cinema. the casting was well chosen, particularly with Keanu Reeves as the hero Neo and Laurence Fishburne as the wise mentor Morpheus whom are both underrated. This is an awesome film that could never be forgotten. easy **** out of **** If you haven't seen this film, you're missing a lot!",10,0,1,16 December 2006
Heat," A cool masterpiece from the Mann
","Miami Vice was no doubt the best cop show every brought on television. I may have come late from seeing this film, but I have to say that this is an excellent feat of movie-making.it is the typical cops chasing robberies story. Al Pacino plays an obsessive detective who is 'on a downslope of a marriage' with his third wife (Diana Venora). The other side of the law is a tough, 'never miss' thief Neil McCauley (Robert de Niro). Both men collide when Neil's crew of thieves steal $1.6 mil, from an armored car, executing all three guards. From here on, the tale explodes like I've never seen before.It is a different form of cops chasing robberies film, simply because the film not only focuses on the action, which was a fair amount in the film, but also the lives of affected by these men and many other lives. The movie gets in deep with the character's and their families and personal struggles, which is captured brilliantly. And Michal Mann does it swell, with a cool taste of music, unforgettable action scenes, including the famous street shootout, and as well as intelligent and compelling actors.The cast illuminates the film and story. This maybe a three hour film, but it flys by, and when it ends, I want more. This is no doubt my favorite Michael Mann creation, besides Vice. Simply a great film that has everything from entertainment value, great stars, such Jon Voight, Val Kimmer, Ashley Judd, etc., drama, and above all strong feeling of saga. 4/4",10,4,8,9 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Father of the sci-fi genre!
","This is easily the best movie of the science-fiction genre. I not only state this because I am Star Wars fan like millions of others around the world, but for many other reasons. Star Wars: A New Hope brought Hollywood up to a new level of visual effects. From the aerial views of Mos Eisley to the battle of Yaven, it's a masterwork in special effects.Additional to the visual works, the cast members were phenomenal in their roles. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker is the perfect protagonist. Harrison Ford is awesome as the funny and cocky Han Solo. Carrie Fisher is simply great as Princes Leia. But the two best performances were Alec Guinness as the wise Obi-wan Kenobi and James Earl Jones as the chilling voice of Hollywood's most infamous villain Darth Vader.Star Wars has an original story of good vs. evil, but it is unique. It follows closely to the hero cycle: an unknown individual who loses everything becomes the galaxy's unlikely hero. The ultimate score by Hollywood's best composer John Williams not only sets the mood for the story, but it also makes it believable and uplifting. Also the other departments of editing, costumes, set-decoration and sound effects editing were all tastefully done.The movie maybe 30 years old, but I hold it as the father of all science-fiction movies. There's no way I can give this less than a 10/10.",10,2,5,29 December 2007
Cloud Atlas," A feast for the eyes that did not fulfill my appetite
","There have been many movies that pushed the envelope in storytelling. 'The Fountain' gave us a love story that takes place over a 1,000 year period. 'Babel' juggles four plots that happen over 3 continents. The only thing these 2 films have in common is that they revoke the typical, chronological order of storytelling. 'Cloud Atlas' takes these concepts further by giving us six stories that occur over many years between themâ€”an 1849 diary of an ocean voyage, letters from a young, naive composer to his friend, a thriller about a nuclear power plant's dark secrets, a farce about a publisher in a nursing home, a clone that takes part in a rebellion during futuristic Korea, and the tale of a tribe living in post-apocalyptic earth in the far away future. Every single genre you can imagine is crammed into this three-hour movie. There is humor, action, drama, mystery, suspense, fantasy, romance, and science fiction. This movie is certainly unique with the wonderful production values of a big budget Hollywood picture. It does not fail with its stunning cinematography and visual effects, exquisite set pieces and costumes, close to spot on make up design, a marvelous musical score, and an all-star cast that includes: Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Jim Broadbent, Keith David, Doona Bae, and many others. Interestingly enough, each of these actors play a character in each of the different story segments of the movie. For me, it is a film that is hard not to like, for I am drawn to all its talents, yet I cannot consider it as revolutionary or even a masterpiece. The non-linear story structure was not the problem. If anything, it helps the film's pace. It's the fact that there are so many plots and there is no solid conclusion to draw all of them together. Some of these stories clearly relate to one another while others seem to be a fluke to the overall movie. The best that I can assume in my viewing is that since each actor is in each subplot, it is a human evolution or reincarnation of the same person, either succeeding or failing in their individual story. This is a novel idea, but (a) it becomes humorous to see actors play different races with incredulous accents (it's particularly bad with Hugo Weaving as a Korean and Doona Bae as a red-haired Caucasian) and (b) it makes the overall film nothing more than a pretentious, unresolved mess. I am aware that this movie is based off of the book and I have not read it, so I cannot make a comparison. But from experience in reading books that have been adapted into movies, it is more enjoyable to read a 500-page book with 6 or more plot devices than viewing a three-hour film trying to do justice to such a novel. If this movie were even 4 hours long, I think it still would not be any better. It would have been more of a success if each segment were turned into a separate flick rather than trying to throw all of them together as a whole. 'Cloud Atlas' is not for everyone. The story structure and lack of resolution may put people off, as could the gratuitous sex and violence. It was a feast for my eyes, but it did not totally satisfy my appetite.",7,6,14,26 October 2012
300," Quite satisfying: Great action and visuals without the real history
","Based off of Frank Miller's graphic novel, 300 is about the spartan warriors who fought and gave their lives at the battle of Thermapolye against impossible odds of the 1,000,000 man Perisan army. For starters, this is not, I repeat not a documentary or historically correct to the battle, for it is based off a comic book.Now, after saying that, the film gives a very bizarre, but creative new look of movie-making. Having not seeing Sin City, (which was the creators of this), I was both flabbergasted and impressed by its unusual feat of movie-making. Instead of just having regular color and a realistic look, the picture has a high quality of tinting, especially of the background scenery. For instance if the film was st nighttime the colorization of the film had dark colors flooding the screen, and when it was bright in the day, the coloring was bright. The color also had this affect in the buildings and landscape as well throughout the film. Personally, this gave a very godlike and mythical look of the film. It was amazing to even look at! Also added to this amazement, the film has some of the best CGI and animation I have seen since The Return of the King. The visuals were great in both the battle sequences and in other places, throughout the film. Along with some great make-up jobs of the variety of creatures (which were many), to the artsy production design. Even more exciting was the battles.It took about a half hour for them to arrive, but when they come, there is no end to the action-oriented gallons of blood and maimed bodies that filled the screen (sorry for the squeamish). Although there is much slaughter in the film, it maybe exciting to the blood and gore fans, but the violence is depicted rather unrealistically like a video game, for each Spartan seems to kill hundreds and hundreds of Persians without even receiving a single injury. It is rather cartoonish and stylized, but at least holds a hint of reality to it. Basically, expect much blood, that doesn't even look real, its more computer generated blood splatters and hacked off limbs flying around in slow-motion, like Kill Bill rather than the horror of Braveheart or Gladiator. It is action oriented, and not too painful to watch, but rather long lasting.The acting was very good. Gerald Butler, once again proves to be a talented actor as the courageous and bloodthirsty, but humane and moral King Leonardis. There weren't too many other recognizable faces, but they all did equally as well, bringing forth likable and believable characters that fight and face their doom without fear.However, its flaw was the story. It was a simple story of war, courage, and destiny, but it did not broaden too much, nor did have a strong, emotional effect like Braveheart. It still held some emotion to it, but not much. Besides, there isn't too much dialog to the film and it also holds some hokey elements that drifted from it anyway. It's an action flick with great effects/cinematography and amazing battle sequences with a pounding a hard core rock soundtrack. There's no heavy history to it like Alexander, nor it has a heavy moral tale like Gladiator.It's a great diversion that left me satisfied. ***1/2 out of **** When you want an action film that satisfies the need of a diversion, I highly suggest 300!",9,4,10,10 March 2007
Ran," A glamorous Shakespearean achievement!! Kurosawa is truly one of the best directors!
","The film Ran is based upon the Shakespearean tragedy of King Lear with a Japanese feeling, and some samurai tales added to it. The film is about an aging war lord named Hidetora who leads a clan called the Ichimonji and has three sons: Taro, Jiro, and Saburo. he decides to split his rule into thirds with his eldest as the leader. Everyone who hears the news is outraged, and his youngest son Saburo speaks agaisnt his father, only to tell the truth nad is thus banished from the kingdom, as well as his advisable councilor Tango.His two other sons soon become corrupt with greed and power, which takes up about the first hour of the film, which is rather slow paced and filled with Shakespearean like dialogue. it sounds o.k. from here. Then, without a warning, a huge battle sequence explodes on the screen started by his two sons! The battle is depicted in a very horrific but beautful sense that shows to other war films that filmmakers don't need visual effects and blaring music to fulfill the battle.because of this betrayal, Hidetora is forced into insanity and escapes the battle alive, while is eldest Taro dies, and Jiro takes the throne of the clan. As fate comes, Tango and his court jester Kyomi, who is wonderfully portrayed by Peter; Tango leaves to find Saburo who seeking him out, who has hidden hismelf with one of the other clans.here the film jumps between the story of Hidetora and Kyomi, which swtich roles beautifully from king to fool, to fool to king, and the manipulating power of Lady Kaede who seduces Jiro leader the Ichimonji clan. the film goes on with a gradual, but necessary pace for a two hour forty minute film.it is a film of tragedy, betrayal, and the powers of greed and deception. The most magnificent thing about this film is the cinematography that shows the mood of the story very explicitly. the costumes and set-decorations are fabulous and well made, the acting is grand, the music is haunting, and the story tells us that we should not fall for our desires, but fall for the goodness in life. 5/5",10,0,3,10 October 2004
The Thin Red Line," Beautiful and enticing but yet not perfect
","There's no doubt that Terrence Malick is a lover of nature. I learned this from his painstakingly long The New World. Although this was almost a three hour movie, it held my interest from start to ending. This is not an action flick, but that's not the thing that kept my interest in this movie. This film draws a solid line between God's beauty of the earth and nature, and man's inhumanity and destruction of it.There are many attractive shots of the Guadalcanal landscapes, hillsides, beaches, and animals at work in nature. In the mist of such a gorgeous place, man's destruction of WWII engulfs it. This maybe no Private Ryan in its depiction of war, but seeing the casualties of both American and Japanese soldiers is more saddening and painful to watch. Why? This movie has some of the most powerful battle sequences I have ever seen. From the bombardment and slaughter on the hillside to the grisly hand-to-hand combat in the fog, they're captured brilliantly. The cinematography by John Toll and score by Hans Zimmer absolutely capture the tone and pulled me right into the gates of Hades.Compared to Saving Private Ryan, which is a patriotic film, The Thin Red Line is an anti-war picture. Most of the characters are young men who don't want to fight, die, or even kill. They only fight because they're ordered. There are no heroes which Private Ryan depicted. There is no patriotism.There aren't many popular actors in the movie either, at least ones that weren't popular in 1998. Adrian Brody, Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin and many other faces lead the movie. I have to say though that it was a bit difficult to know who was who since all of them are: young, wearing helmets, and smeared with dirt and blood. They're voices even sound the same. This got on my nerves a bit when each of the actors would give their share of narration. I would often ask myself: Which character is now narrating? Actors John Travolta and George Clooney are minimal in the film. The only actors that really stood out for me were Sean Penn, Elias Koteas and Nick Nolte who really shine the screen.Because of the hell these soldiers go through, their lives ultimately change. The question of the film brings us this question: How can such a beautiful world be consumed by such inhumanity and madness? People probably dismissed this movie of even existing in 1998 and its 7 Oscar nominations. Personally, I found this to be a more engaging movie than Ryan. I felt for the characters, I did not for Private Ryan. We're all human.Now I'm not saying that this is the best war film ever made. I felt the characters' narrations were overused, overdone, and confusing. I also felt that the director had way too many shots of nature; I'll say again they were all beautiful, but they distracted the movie from the plot. I felt that there was much more to the story than was shown. Perhaps there'll be a director's cut or an extended version. 8/10",8,3,7,20 January 2008
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Well this was worth the price of admission
","I saw this at a drive-in. There were multiple 'technical difficulties' and the movie did not start on time. Even with these discrepancies, 'Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted' proves to be the most entertaining animation this year. It outdoes its predecessors in so many levels.Bored with their time in Africa, Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Gloria the Hippo, and Melman the Giraffe make an effort to get back to the Big Apple. They end up getting pursued by Europe's most notorious animal catcher, Chantel Dubois. To evade capture, they hide out with an animal circus that is traveling Europe. Here they meet new friends and attempt to work their way home. A huge advantage to this Madagascar over the others is the story. Sure, the plot is simple, but it is effective. The fact that there is a villain helps push it alongâ€”unlike the other Madagascar films. These movies have always been known for going over the top. This one takes it to the extent that it is ridiculously funny. The penguins clean out casinos with the help of the monkeys in human disguise. A tiger can jump through a circus ring that is smaller than a doorknob. King Julien falls in love with a bear that wears a tutu and rides a bicycle. The animals drive a car in a chase that nearly destroys Monte Carlo. And all of this is just within the first half hour. The voice talent from the previous films return at their very best, which scores some points. However, the new voice actors outshine the original cast. Martin Short delivers cleverly as the idiotic Italian Seal Stefano. Bryan Cranston pulls off a marvelous Russian accent as Vitaly the Tiger. Jessica Chastain sells as the adorable Gia. The one who tops them all though is Frances McDormand as Captain Chantel Duboisâ€”the movie's antagonist. She makes a good French accent and enunciates her words with a sly, devilishness. In addition, her character design and the animators make her capable of anything. She can dodge vehicles in a car chase, crawl on all fours like a spider, and even sing her minions to perfect health. If an animated character could win an Oscar, it should go to Chantel Dubois! I enjoyed every minute of this movie and I will buy it when it hits the retail stores. As Skipper says, 'Well that was worth the price of admission.'",9,2,4,3 July 2012
Sin City," Tribute to film noir with a mesmerizing visual style
","Film noir. A genre often about violent men stuck in a corrupt, crime-ridden city filled with menacing thugs and succubusses. The main character's situation is often a result of past mistakes, current mistakes, or just plain bad luck. This genre has been revamped over and over again, but not with such a strong flare as 'Sin City.' The movie itself is not only an example of the popular genre, but it is also like watching a comic book brought to life. Based off of the short stories from Frank Miller, 'Sin City' is a unique tribute to the good old crime films combined with the visual style that Zack Snyder and 'The Spirit' has copied from--desaturated tone, with strong emphasis on bright colors like red for blood, blue for eyes, and yellow for well...the yellow bastard. To explain the story of this movie would be like trying to read its outline aloud. It is not necessarily complex, on the contrary, it is straightforward. The best way to put it is a collection of four stories spread out through the two-hour film, and they are somehow tied together. Sounds very similar to Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction.' This is not surprising since he was a 'guest director' for the film. That aside, the pace and various plots are never dull or pretentious. Each separate plot stands on its own yet has the magic to relate to the movie's whole picture. All very good I say.The all-star cast makes this movie very impressionable. Mickey Rourke stands out very strong. The hard-ass he plays feels so in character for him, like with his wonderful work in 'The Wrestler.' It may seem unfair to mention Rourke first. However, each actor, no matter their length of screen time, fits their characters with sublime perfection. Willis, Owen, Wood, Duncan, Dawson, Alba--all of them match Rourke's caliber in this film. In short, 'Sin City' is a great movie for people with an acquire taste for comic books and film noir. The down-to-earth people who like to stick with romantic comedies and conventional action flicks may not like this so much. 'Sin City' is not meant for everyone. It is full of gratuitous sexual content and bloody, stylized violence that ranges from cartoonish to borderline sadistic (cannibalism and castration are actions that are explored). As a viewer who relishes such debauchery put to the extreme though, I love it. A fun, visually gripping, and on occasion ridiculous, 'Sin City' succeeds. It is unfortunate that Rodriguez did not take home an Oscar for Cinemaotgraphy.",10,3,4,31 July 2013
Gangs of New York," Totally Underrated!
","For me, most of the films in 2002 sucked hard, but this film grasped me completely with a sense of amazement and darkness. i have not seen many Scorsese films, but of the ones I've seen, this is his best! The film is based on the brutal, depressing, and savagery of New York before modernization. It goes back in the 1800s before and during the Civil war. it was the time when gangs ruled the streets, the cops were outnumbered and corrupt, and the majority of people suffered.The story follows a man named Amsterdam Vallon (Leo DiCaprio), who as a child, in the beginning, witnesses his father, Priet Vallon (Liam Neeson), brutally murdered in a vicious and highly intense brawl of hundreds of men slaughtering one another when the streets and the snow in 1846. He was murdered by a man named Will Cutting, or has he was known as Bill the Bucher, outstandingly played by Daniel Day-lewis.After sixteen years of the fight in the streets in 1846, Vallon returns as a young man to find the man who killed his father, and seek vengeance. he returns to the New York City which has only grown deeper into a city of sin to find Bill the Butcher. He encounters many obstacles including a young woman, they call a 'turtle dove' (Cameron Diaz who pick-pockets for a living.He later on finds Bill, and instead of seeking immediate vengeance he develops an unusual father-and-son relationship that makes the film all the powerful. Amsterdam, head-on learns the true nature of New York and how to survive in it with victory. But when Bill learns Amsterdam's intentions, he is banished and therefore he builds an army to take on Bill and his gang of the Five Points to rule New York City. little does everyone know that the war is worsening, and it'll outbreak in the city itself, creating chaos and inevitable destruction.Winner of ten academy award nominations, the film truly deserved all of them; at least a lot of them. the costumes and set-decorations were authentic and pretty, the cinematography explored the mood of a forgotten city, the music was dark and rather vacant, but above all, the acting by Daniel Day-Lewis was truly Oscar worthy! But this film isn't for everyone. the film is depressing and dark, people, especially woman are portrayed as whores in it, and the violence in this film was deeply brutal. I am not much of a squeamish person, but this film was bad enough to catch me off guard and make me say 'oh my God!' literally, there's blood and bodies flowing in the streets in the start and the violent climax.For me, it was probably the year's best film. Everything was great, besides the gritty violence, but also the pace dragged in places. it not only depicts its gritty and violent nature, but also the power of manipulation. 9/10 It's not the best film I've seen, but the best of 2002.",9,0,1,27 May 2006
Windtalkers," Unrealistic, but still fun
","It's okay for American soldiers to run over open fields and not get wiped out by artillery and heavy gunfire. It's possible that one man can take out an entire Japanese army with a Thompson submachine gun. It's definitely accurate for Japanese soldiers to only shoot at U.S. troops when they're only fifteen feet away. And it is realistic, when shot twenty times to keep screaming and bleed a quarter of bright orange or pink blood. Uhm? This sounds more like a M-rated video game rather than a war picture.'Windtalkers', directed by one of my favorite action directors John Woo, delivers this versus something along the lines of 'Enemy at the Gates' or 'Private Ryan.' He definitely holds to his stylish action of slow-motion images, CGI, and fireworks-like explosions, with a slight feeling of the mayhem of war, which leaves me, satisfied enough to sit through the two hour and fourteen minute 'popcorn loving' film.Despite this cartoonish feeling, the film has some decent performances, particularly by Adam Beach and Roger Willie as the two Navajo Indians and the hot-headed Christian Slater. Nicholas Cage is his typical self as the impenetrable hero (as exaggerated in the first paragraph). And the historical look of the Navajos and their unbreakable code was mildly interesting.I was entertained through the film, but I got nothing out of it. It's just another unrealistic action flick with a World War II setting. 5/10",5,0,1,5 August 2007
Braveheart," The Best film of all time!
","There are many criticisms about how inaccurate this film is to the real William Wallace. But i have to say to the by-the-book historians to shut up and enjoy the greatest film ever made! Braveheart is obviously about William Wallace's tale against the English in the medieval days. Mel Gibson's direction is beautifully done, with countless aerial views of the fair land of Scotland, which pulls the viewer into the film's romantic vision of a wonderful land and gives them all the background information you need to know about the land, with the help of the cinematography by John Toll. The music composed the famous James Horner fits the vision with a powerful flow that deepens the story into something amazing. Now, Mel Gibson plays the legendary role of Wallace in such a believable performance that is up there with Russel Crowe's for Gladiator. The accents may jump around with his tone when he speaks, but his voice is firm and strong for the role, as is the rest of the cast which were all excellent. Patrick McGoohan portrayed Longshanks very viciously and as a hateful villain. Sophie Marceau is the stunningly attractive, but naive lady who is drawn between country and what she truly believes in.The best part about the whole film though, is the two epic battle sequences that are not choppy, nor has the shaky camera like so many other films nowadays do, avoiding all the blood and gore a battle really contains. This movie surely rubs it in your face, and is needed to make what these men believed in, for what they were fighting for...freedom! it had to be as realistic as possible, and not to mention the slow-motion images again by John Toll, the sound mixing, and the uplifting score of James Horner, which makes them all the more intense and moving.And last but not least, the film, despite all the art it values, it has a great story that is powerful and stands strong alone. it is easily my favorite film, and is the best one ever made. I am incredulous that IMDb holds it at #93 on the top 250. It should be at least on the top ten. If only more epics were made this way, Hollywood would not be in the mess they are in.",10,15,27,12 July 2006
Happy Feet," Great animation, but not animated in other aspects
","In this film, I expected every other animation film has had in the past: humor, a good story, talented voices, and great animation. This film, right of the bat has some of the most excellent animation I've ever seen on the big screen! Even more superb was the use of real-life footage of actual people moving around in the background, later on in the film. It was just fantastic.Another aspect the film granted was a good morale story of a penguin named Mumble, who is isolated from his fellow penguins because he can't sing, which leads to his journey of exploring the icy slopes and landscapes of Antarctica, coming across very unusual obstacles, which leads to the battle between nature vs. man (I don't want to give away more of the story).But what damaged the movie, in my mind was the lack of humor, and the film lacks it because the story intervenes with it. The story is so mature, that it invovles politics, global warming, and the whole deal with humans starving the animal kingdoms (the penguins in this case). This blackened the film, which looks like an ordinary kids film to a film of controversy that is not meant to be. And not to mention the talented voices, which were honestly nto that great. Okay, Robin Williams was his usual self, but to break some hearts, he was extremely limited in the film, not as funny as he usually is, despite the fact that he does two very talented voices. Some other cast voices were good like: Hugh Jackman and Nichol Kidman, and the singing lyrics were good, but it involved a lot inappropriate inneuendo (the penguins talking abou sex, even though its left implied, but you get the idea of how physical they act around one another.) IT all felt weak compared to recent films like Madagascar or Over the Hedge. Previously said, the humor was limited, and since it was limited, it wasn't that animated. (Even in the theater, I noticed kids dosing off because they weren't seeing any action.) Since this was all absent, the film dragged on and on, and my butt starting itching.it was an okay film, but lacked the entertainment of making an animated film. my rating **1/2 out of **** this movie is not really for kids. The penguins may act all 'cute and cuddly', but they aren't over the top hysterical.",5,3,6,9 December 2006
Her," Not only a wonderful film, but one that makes us reflect upon ourselves...
","As strange as Spike Jonze's movies may be, 'Her' is the most personal film he has ever made. It explores a very well-known topic in a unique style and setting. Taking place in the not so distant future, writer Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) finds himself in a life that has no purpose. He wanders each day in a trance, reading out letters at his job and recalling loving memories of his soon-to-be ex-wife (Rooney Mara). He buys himself an advanced operating system who later goes by the name 'Samantha' (Scarlett Johansen). The two develop a romantic relationship. The premise of the movie is very out there, and probably the average moviegoer may see the previews as dumb and pretentious. Fortunately, the movie is not so weird as to be blatantly stupid. Instead, there is very strong subtexts and deeper meanings that make the feature very thought provoking and enjoyable. Spike Jonze does throw in satirical bits on society's obsession with social media, video games, and even sexual vulgarity. Beneath all that, he gives us very complex and well-written characters that many of us can relate to--especially ones who are currently going through divorces and break ups. The irony that plays so beautifully in 'Her' is that people seek devices, like email, Facebook, and online dating sites to engage in friendships, yet we are never really there with those people. Our relationships, if we dare call them that, is nothing more than a computer that we preserve as viable. Watching Twombly follow a similar path with his OS (as millions do today) is not only intriguing, but it is a reflection of ourselves in terms of isolation and compulsions towards media. 'Her' is simply a wonderful film with great performances. Joaquin Phoenix once again transforms himself into his character as the introverted Theodore. He is a guy to care for, understand, and even relatable. Scarlett Johansen, whom I never really thought much as an actress, does a stand-up job as the voice of Samantha. I never would have imagined her deep, sultry voice would make such a fun character. The other supporting cast members do well, however, it is Joaquin and Johansen who carry the film. The muted color scheme and cubic set designs add the flare of a futuristic society and the CGI when used is impressive. The music by Arcade Fire is another good, emotional touch to an otherwise great movie. The ending may leave a bad aftertaste for some people and the film drags on occasion, but neither of these are a real hindrance. The golden globe that Spike Jonze won was well earned. I hope he goes on to win the WGA and the Oscar for what he has done with this film. Fingers crossed, let's hope Joaquin Phoenix gets another academy award nomination.",10,1,4,13 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," One of this year's best pictures!
","I'll be honest, I did not even hear about this movie until I roamed around on the Internet and found it at IMDb. Seeing that it had a high rating and being nominated for 4 golden globes, I chose to see it. After the two-hour movie flew by, I couldn't help but think how amazing it is. 'Slumdog Millionaire' is about an orphan who grows up in the slums of Mumbai. It is told through flashback by an 18-year old boy named Jamal as he is questioned by the police of the crime of cheating on the Indian version of 'Who wants to be a Millionaire?' The movie does follow the typical rags to riches scenario, but it is made creative by the Indian performers who I thought were well excellent in their roles. Dev Patel as Jamal is on his way for a very promising career. In addition to the cast, Danny Boyle's direction not only tells the story but also makes it alive. The way he filmed it made me feel like I was in the slums of India, right in where the people sleep in trash heaps and poop in little outhouses that are right by the river. His use of wide and master shots makes this magic believable. Such use of camera shots, as well as quick editing and close ups helps build the tensions in the scenes throughout the film.At the same time, he captures another India of the wealthy. He reveals the real, modern-day India, unlike films such as 'Passage to India' or 'Ghandi'. One thing I couldn't help but notice about this film is the work of the photographer. The cinematography is different than any other movie I have seen. There's something very 'surreal' and vibrant about the lighting and color in the film, as if the sun is the primary source of light (which to a degree is in the outdoor sequences). However, I noticed that in the indoor scenes, this surreal look is still present, particularly based on light sources within those scenes. In addition with the cinematographer, the sound editors put a lot of emphasis on the background noise. This adds more to the authenticity of the film. For instance, when a train goes by at a train station in the movie, it is very, very loud, as it is in real life. But the one thing that is always louder than the field sound is the thunderous and heart pounding score by A.R. Rahman. I will note that his love theme at the end of the movie is very touching and moving. Overall, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is a unique film that explores a world that no one would want to be apart of, yet millions of people live it. There is some very good humor at times and there are some very shocking and disturbing scenes. Not the gory kind like in a war picture, but rather the depictions of starving kids running away stealing and lying to earn money and get food maybe emotionally intense for some people. It is a hard film to watch, but it is a very good one. It's not one for everyone, but I love it and I consider it to be one of this year's best pictures!",10,4,10,30 December 2008
Gladiator," One word...Spectacular!
","I heard plenty reviews of excellence about this film, and I wanted to see it for myself. When I saw it, i couldn't keep my eyes off of it, for I was so captivated by it! The key that makes this film so great is how the story flows:A general who becomes a slave. A slave who becomes a Gladiator. A Gladiator who defied an emperor. The General: The film is based off of the time when the Romans were conquering the known world, and it follows the life of a loyal Roman general named Maximus (Russel Crowe). After winning a victory over the Germanians, he is asked for an unusual duty by the dying Caesar Marcus Aurellius (Richard Harris). Maximus learns from Caesar that the politics have been corrupt, as well as his son, Commidus, heir to his throne (Joaquin Phoenix), a coward, more or less.Caesar begs Maximus to be 'the protector of Rome' and to return the power to the senate for democracry versus dictatorship that has ruled Rome since the late Julius Caesar. Maximus refuses, and thus leads to his punishment. Caeasr's jealousy son murders Caesar out of jealousy, and has Maximus executed, who escapes, but suffers a deeper punishment when his only son and wife are brutally killed by Commidus, his so-called brother. (The film carries a strong father atonement with Maximus, who is no richer than farmer, with Caesar who loves him over his own son, who has no virtues.) The Slave: The film changes when Maximus is swept into slavery, and is forced to fight for his life in the entertainment games of gladiators, including the Battle in Chains. He then develops strong relationships with fellow fighters for the vulgar crowd, and his master Proximo (Oliver Reed). Proximo sees Maximus' greatness in being a Gladiator, and beings him, with the other worthy gladiators, to Rome.The Gladiator: Maximus then must fight against impossible odds including the tiger fight and the Battle of Carthage. Each battle he fights for the people brings him closer to vengeance against the ruthless Commidus, and forces him to follow the dream of the late Marcus Aurellius...a free Rome.Gladiator has the strongest storytelling since Ben-hur! Each event is a cause-to-affect that leads to one final conclusion of a war of brothers. One noble, the other a coward. Flat down, i have to say Russel Crowe's performance was excellent and Oscar worthy. The costumes and set-decorations were phenomenal, and gave an authentic and artistic view of an unforgotten Rome, especially with the Colosseum. The cinematography by John Mathieson was beautiful, especially with the usage of blended colors and vivid photography of the scenery of the lands that are traveled in the films' story. Joaquin Phoenix was also excellent as his role as Commidus; critics hate his role for pouting all the time, but he was just fabulous in his role of a jealousy son who wanted to be loved by a father who didn't love him, but at the same time a vicious villain. The rest of the acting was simply great as well.The visual effects were awesome, the battle sequences were very action oriented and contains the bloodshed needed to be realistic, and the other strong element was the powerful score of Hans Zimmer that was deeply cut from the Oscars. The music did not follow one theme like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dargon (which won), but many themes that are uplifting, sad, and very moving. Overall, Gladiator is an epic on a grand scale, that most filmmakers can't follow, because they focus on visual effects versus the story and acting. It is an all time favorite of mine! An easy 5/5 This is no doubt Ridley Scott's (who deserved the Oscar for director) best feat since Blade Runner!",10,1,2,24 July 2006
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," 'Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon' is not as remarkable as the original 2007 release, but it is still so much fun to watch.
","Many critics who hated the second 'Transformers' movie will probably shout about this movie, 'Go away Michael Bay! We don't want to see you and your big-ass explosions again!' Personally, I like Michael Bay's films. 'Transformers: Dark Side of the Moon' is not as remarkable as the original 2007 release, but it is still so much fun to watch. There's much to mention in this review, so I'll be direct.Like the other 'Transformers' films, there are big explosions, sweet action sequences and CGI. However, unlike the prior films, they are more memorable, much longer, and more awesome. I mean the city Chicago becomes a massive war zone between Autobots and Decepticons. For this sequence alone, my eyes were glued to the screen. Michael Bay's ability to put a viewer into this scene as well as with the aid of the outstanding visual effects by IL is purely astounding. Though purely a work of fiction, the screenwriter delivers a comprehensible story. I like how the film's plot ties in the NASA landing on the moon as a 'cover up' to retrieve data from a crashed Autobot ship. This is pretty clever. To push this conspiracy theory attitude, the editors throw in archive footage of the moon landing, and of Presidents Kennedy and Nixon. Much of the cast is the same, yet they are different than in the previous films. There's less humor and more drama. Instead of running and screaming for 2 and half hours, Shia LaBeouf actually does some butt kicking. He even takes on a Decepticon all by himselfâ€”Sam's really grown up. John Tuturro as former Agent Simmons, now a very successful published author, provides much of the comic relief. He's such a character. As usual, Tyrese Gibson and Josh Dumahel kick butt as soldiers. Julie White and Kevin Dunn as Sam's parents deliver clever one-liners, but they are kept to a minimal in this film, which is a good thing since they hogged up too much in the second feature.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley replaces as Sam's girlfriend. She does a better job than Megan Fox. She is both more attractive and delivers better as a more believable character. John Malkovich jumps on board as Sam's boss, playing his eccentric self. Warning: he does not like the color red. Frances McDormand joins too as the new government official that oversees the Autobots. I honestly did not recognize her until the credits rolled; this just shows how well an actress can transform oneself. Even so, Malkovich and McDormand seem out of place in this film. They're characters have no purpose. The only actor whom I consider annoying is Patrick Dempsey. He's a handsome guy with charm, but this not a film for him. He needs to go back and do romantic comedies and chick flicks. The robotic villains are not as up to par either. Shockwave and his snakelike partner appear within the first fifteen minutes of the feature, and then disappear for nearly two hours. Starscream doesn't do anythingâ€”then again he never did much. Likewise, Megatron is very inactive until the very end. In addition, the humor is sparse and much of it borders on juvenile sexual innuendo and stereotypes. Innuendo isn't an issue for me, but I don't need to see African-American stereotypes in the middle of a 'Transformers' film, specifically during an action sequence. The film's ending is also very abruptâ€”there's hardly an epilogue following the forty plus minute war scene. Now I'm getting nitpicky. For big action lovers like myself, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is a wise choice. Michael Bay mentioned he will not do a fourth film. In fact, the ending leaves it so that there won't be another one. If God forbid there is another 'Transformers' movie, I'll be in line to see it. My rating: *** out of ****",7,0,2,1 July 2011
Born on the Fourth of July," An intense film made by Tom Cruise and Oliver Stone
","I always felt that Tom Cruise was a great actor because he puts his heart and mind into all of his roles. In 'Born on the Fourth of July', he illuminates the screen intensely as Ron Kovic, a young man who feels that it is his duty to serve his country in the war against 'communism'. After being paralyzed from his second tour of duty, he quickly develops a change of heart as he sees how the war has affected the nation from violent protests and his memories of combat haunt him. In the end, he learns that war brings nothing but sorrow and becomes an anti-war activist. I'm very, very surprised that Tom didn't get his Oscar for this.Another huge factor that helped make the film's power was the cinematography by Robert Richardson. The battle scenes are tinted red, symbolizing blood. The dreams are in white, representing peace. The visions and other scenes of sorrow are blue. All three colors coincide with the American flag. I'm disappointed that this did not get Mr. Richardson his first Oscar. Uhm? The screenplay by Oliver Stone is pretty good, but his powerful direction makes the film more gripping. The score by John Williams is haunting, although some of it reminds me of The Patriot. In addition, the editing and sound was well-equipped.The lack of character support by Willem Dafoe, Frank Whaley, and Kyra Sedgwick did not harm the film too much; however, I felt the movie left some side stories that could have been developed more like Ron's relationship with his girlfriend Donna. But I what bothered me was the unneeded f-bombs. There was hardly a swear word in the first twenty minutes. Then as soon as the war scenes come along, every character has a bigger mouth than Eric Cartman. I also felt some of the scenes of drug use and sex could have been left out. They added nothing to the story, just an increase of the R rating.Nonetheless, I was captivated by this work of Oliver Stone and Tom Cruise. This is the sixth film I have seen made by Oliver Stone. Of those half a dozen movies, I find this to be his second best, right behind Platoon.",9,0,2,22 March 2008
The Social Network," Fincher, Sorkin, & Eisenberg=a very good movie
","I initially did not see this film because it looked like a contemporary Animal House with a little bit of Facebook thrown in the mix. No, director David Fincher and Academy-Award winner screenwriter Aaron Sorkin had something much more interesting in mind. Yes, there is partying and the film explores how Facebook was invented, but the film's true goal is how low Zack Zuckerberg sunk in expanding his website as well as the prices he paid in doing so. Without giving much of plot away, Zuckerberg not only made one of the most popular websites out there, but he betrayed and practically sold his soul to shady characters to fulfill his dream. Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg is astounding. He depicts his character as a genius, but also as a cold hearted, callous jerk. This though is mostly likely due to his lack of social skills, perhaps a little Asperger's Syndrome? Anyway, Jesse Eisenberg is what makes The Social Network such a fun film to watch. Though he becomes the youngest billionaire in the world via an organization that brings people together, he can never have a solid friendship, much less a relationship. It is quite pathetic, but I also take pity on his character. One scene that is quite engaging to watch is at the end where he adds an ex-girlfriend, whom he humiliated and insulted on his blog, adds her as a friend on Facebook. Every few seconds, he keeps refreshing the page, waiting. He knows what he really wants, but he can't have it. This is what's so unique about Fincher's film. Fincher does an excellent job as director. He puts the viewer right into the film, making it engrossing. Aaron Sorkin's Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for this feature was well deserved; though there is much technical dialog, particularly by the fast-paced Zuckerberg, it is broken down to simplicity for even the most inept computer users to understand. Well done. The dim lighting, deep shadows, and green color tone of the cinematography added an almost atmospheric mood to the film. The editing is clean, crisp and well timed; another well earned Oscar. Trent Raznor and Atticus Ross's score is both haunting and beautiful to listen to, specifically with the combination of piano and synthesize, though I would not scream Oscar. There were much better choices at the 2011 Oscars. The Social Network is a very good film, I would not mind seeing it again, but I am honestly glad that this did not earn Best Picture. Eisenberg for Best Actor however, it is a tough call. Personally, he did as good, perhaps even a better job than Colin Firth in The King's Speech. Again, a tough call. There were a lot of good films in 2010. This is one of them, though not the best.My rating: ***/****",8,0,0,15 June 2011
Goodfellas," A well-crafted gangster film! One of Scorsese's best!
","I finally saw this movie and it still has a little bit of a spell on me. I can't really compare 'Goodfellas' to 'The Godfather' because they're two totally different films. Goodfellas is shown and told through Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) whose only dream was to be a wise guy. The movie follows his journey from starting out as a youth who ran errands to the mob, to being one of the mob's closest members, and his eventual downfall.To cover many of the details in the film, there's much voice-over narration. In many movies, I find that a lot of narration is irritating and at times makes me loose interest in a film since I like to be shown what the film is about, not told. But the narration is a definite exception to this movie because it not only reveals the film as a past event, but also gets into the thoughts and feelings of the main character Henry. His girlfriend Karen (Lorraine Bracco), who later becomes his wife, also has her share of voice-over. An essential part to the film is both of their narration since it not only reveals their thoughts in a given scene, but it also develops a strong bond between the two, which later spirals.Scorsese's direction (who I think can relate a lot to the film, as person who grew up in New York City) is a key driving force in the film. There are many excellent shots in it that I could probably write a book on them. The one that stands out the most for me is in a scene where Henry takes Karen on a date. The camera follows them from the car, past a line of people at the entrance, down a flight of stairs, through a kitchen, and into the restaurant where a few waiters set up a table for them to be in the front of the floor show. This is the power of the mob, but everything that has a beginning has an end. I won't give the end of the film away, but the main man Ray goes from a real somebody to a nobody, which plays in the irony of the film. He gets it all, but then loses it.Another main ingredient in this film is Thelma Schoonmaker's editing. I have come to call her the greatest film editor of all time, and her work of freeze framing scenes, as well as clean cuts in between scenes are priceless. When it comes to the acting, all are great, but Joe Pesci is the real master. I recognize him mostly for being in the Lethal Weapons and Home Alones, but his skills are put to the test in this film as the likable, yet psychotic Tommy. His Oscar was well-deserved (the academy got it right for once).'Goodfellas' though is not a movie for everyone. There's a lot of language (mostly said by Pesci) and some strong bloody violence that may shock and disturb viewers. Other than that, 'Goodfellas' is definitely one of the greatest gangsters films ever made as well as one of Scorsese's best!",10,0,0,22 November 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," It makes me dizzy nd makes me sad/disappointed!
","This movie is totally out of control. the film editing, and the cameraman knows how to give the crowd a headache! The camera made the film so blurry. i could not find a spot in the film when the camera does not move. especially the fighting sequences! i was also disappointed about the film, of what happened to his girlfriend, what he did in his haunting past, and the film seemed to drag. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ! IT was not a terrible film though. It is a descent action film, has a few surprising twists, better acton scenes, and better new characters, like Pam. nothing is what it seems in this film. i did like the very ending and that Damon has once again improved his usage as Bourne. Overall rating 7 out of 10. It is an o.k. film, but not as good as the prequel!",6,0,1,28 July 2004
Valkyrie," A great suspenseful thriller that sheds light on an unforgettable event in WWII history
","'Valkyrie' as the trailers reveals, is about the last assassination attempt made on Hitler's life and the attempted overthrow of the government. The trailers though depict the movie as an action thriller. There is some action, but it is minimum yet that does not make the movie dull at all. Even though the outcome is predictable as I read in my history books, the film moves a mile a minute with suspense and drama. I was not impressed by Bryan Singer's last movie, 'Superman Returns', but in this, he pulls the audience into the depth of these brave characters' plots and schemes. Their motives may not be fully explained, but they are still believable and easy to sympathize with. I personally found Kenneth Branagh's and Tom Wilkinson's performances the best in the supporting category. They are two characters of the opposite spectrum. Branagh's character wants to see this mission through while Wilkinson's character is afraid and on the fence, willing to do anything to cover his butt. As with Tom Cruise, he gives an electrifying performance as Claus Von Stauffenberg. I will admit that I think he needed to work on a German accent to make him more fit for the role. Then again, the majority of the actors in the film were either British or American.I have no problem with that, but some realistic German accents would have made it more authentic like with the English speaking Germans in 'Battle of the Bulge'. I shouldn't complain too much though, since the film starts off with Cruise speaking fluent German and then transfers to English so the audience don't have to read too many subtitles. Overall, 'Valkyrie' is a suspenseful thriller that sheds light on an incident in history, which reveals the courage that men were willing to take, to save a nation from destroying itself.",8,3,5,31 December 2008
The Simpsons Movie," I loved it!
","I've watched 'The Simpsons' for nearly a decade and in that time, I always wondered whether they'd make a Simpsons movie like its competing shows 'South Park' and 'Family Guy'. As a Simpsons fan, I was deeply satisfied with 'The Simpsons Movie'.As always, Homer makes a stupid mistake that puts the town Springfield in a crisis. This time, he pollutes the town's water supply with a silo of 'Pig Crap', which leads the EPA with the option by President Schwarzenegger (which was a laugh riot) to encase the town with a gigantic dome. Once again, Homer and his family must stop the EPA from destroying Springfield before it is too late.Homer is a true Homer in this supported with his sight gags, one-liners, and obvious, laughable stupidity. All the other characters, including: Bart, Lisa, Marge, Maggie, Itchy & Scratchy, Moe, and Flanders (to name a few) were all their typical selves.The plot was a bit on the corny side, but it flowed and was not as hokey as it could have been. The hour and a half film flew by with no slow spots.But to a disappointment, the movie only focused on a few of 'The Simpsons' characters, mainly on Homer and his family. It did have all the characters, yes, but they didn't have a lot of screen time. I was really looking forward to more of Mr. Burns, Smithers, Apu, etc. as well as more of their comic genius. Otherwise, as a Simpsons fan, I loved it! 10/10",10,2,7,11 August 2007
All the President's Men," An average film with too good of a concept and topic.
","In the wake of Watergate and President Nixon's resignation, All the President's Men marked itself as a controversial and compelling film for a nation in a tumultuous time. It was hailed as a masterpiece by critics and it won 4 Academy Awards. Looking back nearly 40 years, the movie is really an example of intriguing subject versus great storytelling. This does not necessarily hinder a decent film, but it also doesn't guarantee a master work either. The pivotal force is centered on the perspectives of two young and eager journalists Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) and Bob Woodward (Robert Redford). Their mission is to uncover the facts about the Watergate break-in. Instead of investigating a simple burglary, they find themselves in government cover-ups, witnesses that will not talk, and even names that do not exist. A story so juicy and fruitful cannot be overlooked. For two hours and eighteen minutes, the audience observes as these men try to get to the bottom of this rabbit hole. While the substance is good and it reflects one of America's darkest times, the pace and delivery is cut and dry. Nothing exciting happens in this movie. The character interactions between Bernstein and Woodward are bland. No acting chemistry is present. They are just two guys who happen to work together. There are no memorable moments that these great thespians share together on camera. The supporting cast is equally uninspiring. Jane Alexander, who received an Oscar nomination for her performance, is only in the movie for 10 minutes and acts as if she has a nervous twitch and seems more than happy to walk off the movie's set ASAP. Jason Robards, who did win an Academy Award for supporting actor, appears in a sleepy trance throughout the film as the head of the newspaper organization. The amount of times he sets his feet up on a table and leans back in his chair, I half expected him to take a nap. Frankly, if this is what it takes to win some accolades, sign me up. Jack Warden as Bernstein and Woodward's boss and Hal Holbrook as Deep Throat are the only actors that unveil some infliction and power in their performances. Unfortunately, Holbrook's prowess is hidden in the shadows by cinematographer Gordon Willis, intentionally adding the secretive nature of his character. I could very well be judging this movie a bit too harshly. I did not grow up during the reign of Nixon, so I cannot comprehend this movie's power at its release. However, I can look back at history from a nostalgic perspective and determine whether I like an older film. Taxi Driver, Network, Rocky, and The Marathon Man were all released the same year as All the President's Men. All of them are excellent films that can never grow dated or lose their entertainment values. 'All the President's Men' is linked to the past and purely documents a single event in time. It relies too much on facts and details that it forgets to tell an engrossing plot. This is the main reason why I cannot accept this movie as a masterpiece. The subject matter did get me through the film once, but I can never see myself viewing it again. The highlights that I do give this movie is the dedication that the set designers put into the recreation of the newsroom, Gordon Willis's lighting style for the night scenes, and the sound mixers accomplishment of overlaying land line phone calls with meticulous perfection. In short, this is an average film with too good of a concept and topic.",6,3,6,20 September 2014
The Soloist," A very good drama that'll be sourly overlooked
","Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to see this in theaters because it was in and out very quickly. I finally got a chance to see this, a couple of nights ago and I was thoroughly impressed. Jamie Foxx (who plays Nathaniel Ayers) and Robert Downey Jr. (who plays Steve Lopez) are not my favorite actors, but both fit their roles very well. They have excellent chemistry, and I deeply care for their characters. I also enjoyed how the film depicted schizophrenia. It isn't shown, as something the character understands like with Russell Crowe's character in 'A Beautiful Mind', but rather a dark, mysterious presence that drives Nathaniel into violent mood swings and actions. It's hard to depict in film on what's going on in someone's mind, but the randomness and unpredictability of Nathaniel makes it unique. Though the movie's focus is on Nathaniel, our sympathy lies on Steve, as he at first sees Nathaniel as a source for helping his career, but later ends up caring for him as a friend. He has his limits and at times loses it, but it is something we can relate to, trying to aid someone in whom you don't know how to help and then lose patience due to that.Aiding in the performances is some very beautiful cinematography by Seamus McGarvey (who helped Joe Wright with 'Atonement'). His choice of colors, lighting, and camera angles add a dark and abstract feeling to the film, which reflects the mind of Nathaniel. The film also has beautiful/authentic looking sets and crisp clean editing and Dario Marianelli's choice of music is mainly pieces of classical music, but like the cinematography, it reflects the mood and emotions of Nathaniel as well as the story.We've seen this plot many times, as of the likes in 'Rain Man' and 'A Beautiful Mind', in which the Oscars love to bait, but 'The Soloist' is unique and different. It isn't syrupy or over-dramatic. It is a rock solid drama that is both enjoyable to watch and grabs your emotions. It also sheds light on one of this country's biggest problems, the injustice of the homeless. And I'm disappointed that this film hasn't received any golden globe noms and it will be unlikely to be nominated for something for the 2010 Oscars. Though I enjoy this movie, the film ended too quickly and I felt it could have explained more about Nathaniel's condition. Yes, I love the technical aspects on how it reflects his mood with the cinematography and music, but it needed more plot to explain how he got it and how it affected his family. We know how it has affected him, but it doesn't show a whole lot of the damage it has caused the people around him, which have forced him to live on the streets of L.A. Despite this small gap in the story, I consider 'The Soloist' as one of this year's best films. I haven't seen too many spectacular ones this year, but this one is very good. ***1/2 out of ****",9,1,2,30 December 2009
The Fighter," The only regret I have about this film is that I did not see it in theaters.
","Though 'The Fighter' presents itself as another boxing movie, it has much more to offer. The story's focus is Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), who dreams of winning a boxing title. The plot includes the relationships with his bartender girlfriend (Amy Adams), his brother Dicky (Christian Bale), his mother (Melissa Leo) and the remaining members of his family. Despite Wahlberg being the lead, the supporting cast steals the show. Both Bale and Leo won Oscars for their performances. Having seen this, both thoroughly deserved them. I've seen Bale in many movies, dating back to when he was a kid. He has really grown up and engulfed himself into his character, which goes on a path of drug abuse, prison, and later redemption. His character is a jerk to the core, yet he builds sympathy for his character. He's hard not to like; he's funny, charming, and knows how to throw a good punch. Like Bale, Leo adds quite a few layers to her character. Rather than following the one- dimensional villainous mother, she comes off as someone to pity rather than despise. She does what she thinks is right for her son Micky, but she's so blinded by this that she fails to realize what he really wants. 'The Fighter' could very easily have fallen into the category of a soap opera (and to a degree it is), but it so much better and more believable via such powerful performances. David O. Russel has made a well-done masterpiece. 'The Fighter' will make you laugh a lot. It will engage and move you. And it may even make some cry. The only regret I have about this film is that I did not see it in theaters. Even so, I am glad that I viewed this film, and I will definitely watch it again in the future.",9,0,1,3 September 2011
Up in the Air," A witty story and brilliant performances makes 'Up In The Air' an excellent film.
","Hearing all the hype and praise for this movie, I had to go see it. I anticipated another romantic comedy that George Clooney is known for doing. Yes, there is some humor, mostly dark, and there is romance, but that doesn't make it a romantic comedy. In fact, it is a rather serious film. Basically, the movie follows Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who works for a company that fires employees from bosses who are too cowardly to carry out the task themselves. This includes Ryan traveling around the country, over three hundred days out of the year. He loves his job and sees it as a service. In fact, this is all that he has in the beginning. But he quickly becomes intimate with the sexy Alex (Vera Farmiga) and has to take a new employee Natalie (Anna Kendrick) under his wing to show what his job is really like. This pretty much sums up the first half of the film. But the second half pursues a more interesting storyline. As Ryan develops his relationships with these two women, he begins to change. A man who has been isolated by his job, and thinks that an ordinary life of love, marriage, and kids is malarkey attends his sister's wedding and begins to see that he desires companionship. He wants love. Now I won't give away the ending for it is both surprising and emotional. The screenwriters make it good without getting all syrupy, nor melodramatic. This plot may seem simple enough, but the controversial topic of companies firing their employees is a big part to this film and the collection of shots used of actual employees reactions when they hear the news that they are 'let go' is priceless and scary, especially when it hits home.Regarding the acting, it is top-notched. I think no other actor but George Clooney could have pulled off the role of Ryan Bingham. He's golden globe nom is well deserved. Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick are both equally brilliant in their performances, but I think Miss Kendrick has a better chance of winning than Vera, for there is more sympathy towards her character. On a honest note, I've never seen a Jason Reitman film, but this movie shows that he has talent. The editing is clear-cut and sharp, and there are some great camera angles, specifically with the aerial shots of the cities and the sky. If this film gets any Oscar, which I'm sure it will, writers Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner should win for Best Adapted Screenplay. They make a simple story into a unique film. This movie proves that it doesn't take an overload of CGI to make a movie enticing; it flew by without a pause. A witty story and brilliant performances makes 'Up In The Air' an excellent film.My rating: **** out of ****",10,0,4,8 January 2010
Atonement," Like reading a book; you need to decide on it for yourself
","I waited several months to see this movie. After finally seeing it, it was hard for me to decide whether I really enjoyed it or not. My expectations, as the advertisement built it up as if it were the next English Patient. To a degree, it has some similarities with the flashbacks and romance but instead of the story being told by the lovers, it is told by a third party. In 1935, 13-year-old apprentice writer Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) and her family live a life of wealth and luxury in their enormous mansion. Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), the family's grounds keeper, has feelings for Briony's older sister Cecilia (Ms. Knightley). He hopes she has similar feelings towards him. All it will take is one spark for this relationship to illuminate. When it does, Briony who has a crush on Robbie is compelled to interfere, going so far as accusing Robbie of a crime he did not commit. Cecilia and Robbie declare their love for each other, but he is arrested. By Briony's false witness, the course of three lives is changed forever. Later on in life, Briony comes to her senses and realizes what she had done and seeks for atonement.An interesting aspect to the film was how well it showed different perspectives. For instance, there is a scene where Robbie and Cecelia stand and talk near a fountain. It first shows a 13 year old Briony looking at them through a window, wondering what they're talking about. Right after that, the film shows the same scene through Robbie's and Cecelia's viewpoint of what they actually said and did. The editing was unpredictable at times and made me somewhat confused, but the more I thought about it, the more interested and engrossed I felt about the movie. It was like reading the original novel, leaving the audience to ponder on what'll happen next and how everything would be tied together. The 130 minute film was not set at quick pace, but the character's different stories and viewpoints made it an enjoyable and deep thought movie. The direction was absolutely breathtaking. One of the most amazing scenes in the movie was when Robbie entered Dunkirk. The camera has one aerial shot, and then pulls to his viewpoint of the chaos and tragedy. The cinematography was beautiful and suited the tone for the time period. The score by Dario Marianelli really set the mood for the film. When something sad happened in the film, the music was sad. When something suspenseful happened, it was uplifting. However, I felt sometimes that the music may have been overdone in a few scenes. The performances were wonderful. Keira Knightley is brilliant as Cecilia. There's no doubt that she'll get a second nomination for Best Actress. James McAvoy, whom I felt was perfect in The Last King of Scotland, was astonishing. Of the many scenes he was in the movie, the one scene that moved me most was when he comes upon a group of dead school children. It was a very emotional scene, but the tears in his eyes were even more moving. He should definitely get the Best Actor. I can't forget to mention the supporting cast either. The three actresses who played Briony from Saoirse Ronan at 13, Romola Garai at 18, and Vanessa Redgrave at old age were all amazing. Of the three, I feel that Saorise Ronan did the best job. Unlike many child thespians, she was not rehearsed. I could easily understand her feelings and motives. Overall, this was an excellent movie. This has not been the best year for movies like the last few years, but this is the best I have seen for this year. I can see at least ten Oscar nominations coming its way, including Best Picture. 10/10",10,5,8,29 December 2007
V for Vendetta," A Great combination of action and story!
","I watched this film with an open-mind, having no idea what to expect. After the two hours passed by, I experienced true entertainment, and a sense of truth and awe.The film depicts the graphic comic book about the vigilante who goes by the name of V. It takes place in the near future, with England and other nations under a Nazi like, dictatorship that rules over everything. It is led by the Chancellor. This ideal form of government is supposed to suppress all forms of terrorism and make everything peaceful.But V sees things in a different light and has a plan of his own. People may criticize and compare the character V as Darth Vader for he wears all black, has similar political views of Michael Moore, and wears a top hat with a Guy Fox mask. I strong disagree with this comparison or even criticism, for V is character of his own (perhaps not too many reviewers have read or known about the comic book) and he is portrayed very wonderfully by Hugo Weaving. Even more criticism is aimed at the political views in the film. For instance the Chancellor, played by John Hurt, portrays a pure image of Adolf Hitler (even though he was no more than a shouting figurehead). To a degree I agree with this criticism, but there is no intention of propaganda in this film. there maybe controversy, but it is not out to bash the Leftists. Now after saying that, the story goes on with V meeting a woman named Evy (Natalie Portman) who seeks the truth one night as she's mugged. He rescues her, and the two develop a relationship that revolves around the corruption of the government and what life was once like before it fell into the Fascist like dictatorship. To formulate his scheme, he needs her help, in which leads to a tale of darkness, destruction, misery, and well needed peace and freedom to save the world. This movie was extremely well done from the dark and grim cinematography that explores the tone of the story (R.I.P. Adrian Biddle), to the fabulous set-decoration and script, and the awesome fight sequences developed by the help of the Wachowski brothers. The film tells and questions country's government's of their true intentions which makes this film all the more controversial. However, the two hour film dragged a little, making me feel a bit uncomfortable in my seat in the theater. There's also much mature content including some disturbing images in the film that needs shielding from youthful eyes. It deserved a solid R rating. It's a great film that has excellent action as well as storyline/controversy. Overall ***1/2 out of ****",10,0,2,27 May 2006
The Godfather," Puzo+Coppolla (multiply) Brando= a classic!!!!
","I have read the book years ago, but never saw the movie. I heard it was the greatest movie of all time and there was no criticisms. i saw this just last month, and it is a near perfect film! I have never seen such a powerful, believable, and moving movie since Schindler's List and Braveheart! The film captures the classical viewpoint of the best-selling novel by Mario Puzo in a very dark, but epic way, revealing the mafia as a manipulating and greedy domain of not just villains, but also of their families. The film is almost a family film in such a way that it is about family, the power of it, and that it should be loved and honored. Taht is one of the main reasons why this is such a glamorous film! The story takes place in the 1940s and 50s, and is about a mafia family called the Coreleone's who came from Sicily. They're a very powerful mafia in New York city led by an aging, persuasive man, Vito Coreleone played by the ultimate Marlon Brando.The story kicks off with the issues and members of the Coreleone family. When Vito Coreleone is gunned down by another mafia family, all hell breaks loose, bringing together the family from the hot-tempered Sonny (James Caan) who is the runner up for leading the Coreleone family, Michael (Al Pacino) who does everything in his power to not join the mob, and Tom Hagen (Rob Duvall), whose the advisable councilor.The story follows these individuals and even more towards the history of this family, with its comings and goings of friends and foes, and issues and solutions.The acting top-notched is excellent, especially by Marlon Brando who well deserved the Oscar. The story is gripping, the settings and costumes are vivid, the cinematography has that gloomy and dark feel, the pace is moderate, the score is dramatic, and the director was well chosen for this film!
