Gremlins," Gleeful anarchy
","A bunch of grotesque reptilian monsters wreak all kinds of crazy and destructive havoc in a heretofore sleepy small town around Christmastime. Director Joe Dante and screenwriter Chris Columbus use the premise to poke wickedly nasty, yet still hilarious and positively infectious fun at such worthy targets as schmaltzy Spielbergian/Disneyesque family fare, small town American life, the film medium and the way people watch movies (the definite gut-busting highlight with this particular aspect occurs with a gloriously raucous screening of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarves'), traditional notions of heroism (the cops prove to be completely ineffectual in a crisis situation, so it's up to some ordinary working class guy to ultimately save the day), and the hokey sappiness of the yuletide season. Moreover, since we're talking Joe Dante here, naturally there are knowing winks and homages to many classic movies sprinkled throughout.Zach Galligan makes for a likeable hero as average schmoe Billy, Phoebe Cates looks absolutely radiant and gets to relate an uproariously appalling story on why her character Kate hates Christmas, Polly Holiday has a field day as mean and greedy old bat Mrs. Deagle, Frances Lee McCain as Billy's feisty mom has a great sequence in which she fights back against the gremlins in her kitchen, and Dick Miller has one of his best roles as crusty Mr. Futterman. In addition, amongst the familiar faces in colorful small parts are Scotty Brady, Keye Luke, Harry Carey Jr., William Schallert, Belinda Balaski, Edward Andrews, and Kenneth Tobey. The practical special effects hold up remarkably well while Gizmo is simply adorable. Jerry Goldsmith's robust'n'wacky score hits the rousing spot. Nice polished cinematography by John Hora, too. An absolute blast.",9,0,1,18 December 2019
It," Very creepy and effective
","This adaptation of Stephen King's mammoth novel works exceptionally well because of how vivid and sympathetic the misfit main characters are: One really believes that these oddball kids are true friends who care about one another and have each other's backs. Jaeden Lieberher, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophie Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Glazer, and Wyatt Olaf are all uniformly fine and credible in their roles while Bill Skarsgard makes for a supremely frightening Pennywise. Moreover, director Andy Muschietti offers a flavorsome evocation of the late 1980's period setting (the News Kids on the Block reference is spot-on sidesplitting!), grounds the fantastic premise in a plausible everyday small town reality, and generates plenty of nerve-rattling suspense. Better still, the spooky supernatural evil of Pennywise is nicely contrasted by such chilling real-life horrors as vicious town bully Henry Bowers (a perfectly hateful portrayal by Jarred Blancard) and Beverly's repellent pedophile father. The special effects are likewise sound and convincing, the gore is generous, but never excessive, and the overall atmosphere tense and eerie throughout. An on the money scarefest.",9,7,13,16 September 2017
Unbreakable," A different kind of super hero film
","Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan wisely eschews big splashy special effects and elaborate action set pieces in order to bring a more low-key, thoughtful, and even melancholy sensibility to the concept of the super hero. Average blue collar security guard David Dunn (a strong and subdued performance by Bruce Willis) miraculously survives a train wreck that kills everyone else on board. David is encouraged by physically frail, but extremely persistent and fiercely intelligent comic book aficionado Elijah Price (superbly played with sharp wit and quiet intensity by Samuel Jackson) to question exactly why he didn't perish in said disaster. Shyamalan grounds the inspired and intriguing story in a plausibly drab and gloomy everyday working class reality. Moreover, Shyamalan uses the fantastic premise to smartly explore the provocative themes of realizing one's heretofore untapped full potential, the need to know precisely why you were put on this earth, the burdensome responsibility those endowed with special abilities have to use those powers for good, and how the forces of good and evil tend to be total physical and spiritual opposites. Willis and Jackson do sterling work in the lead roles; they receive sturdy support from Robin Wright as David's estranged wife Audrey, Spencer Trent Clark as David's awestruck son Joseph, and Chance Kelly as a train station custodian who does home invasions on the side. Kudos are also in order for Eduardo Serra's sumptuous widescreen cinematography and James Newton Howard's majestic orchestral score. An excellent movie.",9,3,5,27 February 2018
Train to Busan," One hell of an intense, exciting, and emotional ride
","A motley assortment of passengers on a train going from Seoul to Bosun are put in great jeopardy when they find themselves caught up in a sudden zombie outbreak both on said train and in the outside world as well.Director/co-writer Sang-ho Yeon keeps the gripping story hurtling along at a breathless breakneck pace, takes time to develop the characters, ably builds a tremendous amount of nerve-rattling tension, maintains a tough take-no-prisoners tone throughout, and stages the attack scenes with rousing go-for-the-throat gusto. Most importantly, Yeon and co-writer Joo-Suk Park bring a surprising pronounced element of pathos and humanity to the premise which in turn ensures that there's plenty of genuinely moving heart to go along with all the harrowing horror. The excellent acting by the tip-top cast further keeps the film on track, with especially stand-out contributions from Yoo Gong as negligent workaholic dad Seok-woo, Su-an Kim as his estranged daughter Soo-an, Dong-seok Ma as the brave Sang-hwa, Yu-mi Jung as the pregnant Seong-Kyeong, Eui-sung Kim as selfish business tycoon Yon-suk, Gwi-hwa Choi as a scared homeless guy, and Sohee as perky cheerleader Jin-hee. The infected folks are extremely ferocious and frightening. Proof positive that there's still some invigorating life left in the zombie horror genre.",9,1,1,6 November 2019
Monster," Charlize Theron is amazing as the notorious Aileen Wournous in this hard-hitting film
","Charlize Theron, barely recognizable with blotchy sunburned skin, stringy unwashed hair, a dumpy figure, smoldering near black eyes, and dentures, delivers a remarkable Oscar-winning portrayal of Aileen Wournous, a bitter, disaffected and down-trodden prostitute who hitchhikes in order to pick up customers and eventually resorts to murder so she can support both herself and her naive lesbian companion Shelby (well played by Christina Ricci). Writer/director Patty Jenkins and Theron do a commendable job of making Wournos a pitiable figure without ever glamorizing her and her infamous exploits. Jenkins offers a fascinatingly stark, bleak and gritty look at the seedy underbelly of America's lower class while pointing out how Aileen's lack of a proper education and past history of abuse made her ineligible for regular employment (the scenes where Wournos makes fumbling attempts at gaining a legitimate job are both funny and heartbreaking in equal measure). Theron holds the picture together with her bravura intense and riveting acting as Aileen; she astutely nails the burning rage and underlying despair Wournos feels about her lowly and miserable station in life. Moreover, there's a poignant doomed love story between Wournos and Shelby amidst all the harshness. While Theron clearly dominates the movie with her powerhouse work as Wournos, the bang-up supporting cast also deserve kudos for their praiseworthy contributions: the always reliable Bruce Dern is typically fine as Aileen's scruffy, sympathetic Vietnam veteran friend Thomas, Lee Tergesen makes a chilling impression as brutal john Vincent Corey, Pruit Taylor Vince has a touching cameo as another stuttering john, and Scott Wilson has a small, but memorable part as Wournos' nice guy last victim Horton. Steve Bernstein's bright, polished cinematography comes through with several striking images. BT's spare, melodic score likewise does the trick. While it's every bit as grim, seamy and depressing as one would expect, this movie is still worth seeing just for Charlize Theron's first-rate mesmerizing performance as one seriously troubled and damaged soul alone.",9,0,2,1 January 2009
The Impossible," Harrowing and touching film
","2004. A family spending Christmas vacation in Thailand are split apart after a tsunami hits the place.Director J.A. Bayona relates the gripping and gut-wrenching story at a constant pace, maintains a stark serious tone throughout, and astutely captures both the staggering beauty and brutality of nature as well as the equally startling chaos and damage wrought by a sudden catastrophe. The ace acting by the top-rate cast rates as another substantial asset: Naomi Watts totally deserved her Oscar nomination for being put through the ringer both physically and emotionally as a wounded, yet resilient mother, Ewan McGregor does terrific work as the father determined to reunite his family, Tom Holland impresses in a difficult role as the oldest son who must stay strong for his mom, and Geraldine Chaplin has a nice cameo as a kindly old woman.Most importantly, director Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sanchez wisely keep the narrative grounded in a very intimate and hence easily relatable level by putting the key emphasis on the tourist family, which in turn gives this film a considerable amount of poignancy and resonance as a moving tribute to the durable human spirit in the absolute worst of circumstances. The special effects are frightfully convincing. Kudos are also in order for Fernando Velazquez's spare score and Oscar Faura's sumptuous widescreen cinematography. The sequence with the big one occurring is downright terrifying in its ferocity. An excellent and affecting film.",9,2,2,11 September 2019
12 Angry Men," An outstanding courtroom drama thriller which benefits greatly from tight direction, a literate script and superb acting from a first-rate cast
","A teenage Puerto Rican boy from the slums is on trial for allegedly murdering his own father. Eleven of the twelve jurors are certain that he's guilty, but one token odd man out dissenting juror (beautifully played with subtle understatement by Henry Fonda) has his doubts. The juror gets everyone else to question their motives and more heavily scrutinize every last minute detail of the seemingly cut and dried case.Director Sidney Lumet, working from Reginald Rose's smart, literate and incisive script, further aided by Boris Kaufman's sharp black and white cinematography and Kenyon Hopkins' spare, unobtrusive score, works wonders with the simple premise, placing a keen and intimate emphasis on the exceptionally colorful and distinctive dozen characters. The uniformly marvelous acting from a bang-up ensemble cast qualifies as a substantial sterling asset: Fonda and Lee J. Cobb are both terrific as radically opposing guys who are at continual loggerheads with each other while Ed Begley (incredibly fearless as a despicable racist jerk), Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney (simply lovely as the old man), George Voskovec, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, John Fiedler, Robert Webber, E.G. Marshall and the criminally underrated Edward Binns all lend top-drawer support in equally meaty roles. The twelve individual jurors serve as a very revealing and insightful microcosm of our justice system in particular and our society in general, representing all the various flaws, strengths and quirks of our culture which range from blithe indifference (Warden's boorish baseball fan, Webber's slick advertising executive) to cold pragmatism (Marshall's prissy intellectual) to meek passivity (Fiedler's soft-spoken wimp) to foul prejudice (Begley's unforgettably odious hatemonger, Cobb's seething ball of roaring rage and resentment) to true blue responsible patriotism (Fonda's calm voice of liberal reason, Sweeney's supportive old man, Voskovec's proud adopted American immigrant). Kaufman's gorgeously crisp photography tremendously heightens the considerable tension, palpably evoking a sweaty, uncomfortable and claustrophobic sweltering hot atmosphere that's as gripping as it is convincing. In the hands of a lesser cast and director the story could have been flat and stagy. But Lumet's tight direction and the seamless ensemble acting from an amazing cast effortlessly blend together to create a crackling sense of absorbing drama and rip-snorting energy that's constantly engrossing and exciting throughout. An undeniable classic.",10,1,2,30 July 2006
Hostel," Brutal shocker
","Hearty party animal Paxton (a solid performance by Jay Hernandez), his wimpy friend Josh (likable Derek Richardson), and their happy-go-lucky Icelandic buddy Oli (a lively and engaging portrayal by Eythor Gudjonsson) run afoul of an underground murder for profit business in Slovakia while backpacking through Europe.Writer/director Eli Roth's no-holds-barred ferocious and unflinching cinematic kick to the stomach not only serves as a trenchant cautionary tale on the perils of ugly Americans happily indulging in all kinds of crass behavior abroad without thinking of the potentially severe consequences until it's too late (for example, the protagonists go to Slovakia with the specific goal of getting laid), but also offers a profoundly disturbing commentary on how people are willing to pay big money in order to act out their worst, most base, and downright cruel impulses simply because they can. Moreover, Roth deserves extra praise for showing just enough of the torture set pieces so that the viewer gets the basic idea without being too grossed out. The grimy subterranean setting projects a potently unsettling sense of dread, isolation, and vulnerability. In addition, there are chilling contributions by Jan Vlasak as a blithely sadistic Dutch businessman, Barbara Nedeljakova as the enticing, yet dangerous Natalya, and Rick Hoffman as a jaded, but still eager and excited American client. Nerve-shredding stuff.",8,1,3,5 April 2016
Cloverfield," Super intense creature feature
","A group of young folks find themselves in considerable jeopardy after a vicious giant monster suddenly attacks New York City.Director Matt Reeves, working from a tight script by Drew Goddard, takes time to develop the characters, grounds the fantastic premise in a believable everyday reality, and generates plenty of nerve-wracking tension. The total absence of a music score and the expert use of a shaky hand-held portable camera give this picture a bracing, riveting, and above all extremely harrowing sense of immediacy and intimacy that basically puts the viewer in the thick of the terrifying action just like the hapless people in the movie; the acute feeling of blind panic and complete chaos is frighteningly well captured. Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas, T.J. Miller, Michael Stahl-David, Mike Vogel, and Odette Annable are all credible as the imperiled protagonists. The scenes of destruction -- the Statue of Liberty's decapitated head rolls down a street, the Brooklyn Bridge gets demolished -- are quite potent and startling. The grim ending also packs a shocking punch. The special effects are convincingly done. An on the money nail biter.",8,1,3,6 December 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Please no fighting in the war room
","Stanley Kubrick's wickedly hilarious end-of-the-world black comedy gem about an impending nuclear war caused by human error straddles a fine line between being fiercely funny and genuinely chilling throughout: As evident by the gross behavior and arrogant attitudes of various high-ranking officials in positions of power that they are neither smart nor mature enough to properly handle, the greatest threat to mankind's safety isn't the existence of nuclear weapons; instead it's such all too real and unavoidable human foibles as pride, stupidity, and incompetence that we should all be more worried about.The savagely mocking script by Kubrick, Peter George, and Terry Southern pulls zero punches in its no-holds-barred satirizing of said foibles and offers numerous uproarious moments of inspired dark humor: The meek and ineffectual President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers in one of three bravura performances) informing the drunken Soviet premier over the phone about the nuclear strike, the hysterically loony speech made by unhinged paranoid General Jack D. Ripper (robustly played with snarly aplomb by Sterling Hayden) about preserving his precious bodily fluids, gung-ho redneck bomber pilot Major 'King' Kong (a marvelously spirited portrayal by Slim Pickens) riding a nuclear missile like a bucking bronco on its final drop while whooping it up, and the gloriously insane plan for survival that batty ex-Nazi adviser Dr. Strangelove (Sellers again at his most sublimely deranged) proposes to President Muffley.Moreover, the zestful acting from the first-rate cast keeps this movie humming: Sellers pulls off a terrific troika of impressive and highly distinctive turns as Muffley, Strangelove, and uptight RAF group captain Lionel Mandrake, George C. Scott has a field day as bellicose commie-bashing hawk General 'Buck' Turgidson, Keenan Wynn does his usual sturdy work as the gruff Colonel 'Bat' Guano, Peter Bull likewise excels as the shifty Russian ambassador Alexi de Sadesky, Tracy Reed briefly steams things up as sexy secretary Miss Scott, and James Earl Jones handles himself well in his film debut as the thorough Lieutenant Lothar Zogg. Kudos are also in order for Gilbert Taylor's sharp black and white cinematography and Laurie Johnson's rousing military marching band score. Worthy of its classic status.",9,9,12,7 August 2017
Alien," Why this landmark sci-fi/horror classic still works
","There are several reasons why this remarkably taut, scary and effective science fiction/horror hybrid holds up so well to this very day. 1.) The premise ingeniously mixes elements from two separate, yet compatible genres into a strong and satisfying synthesis. The futuristic outer space setting is pure sci-fi, but the grotesque monster, ghastly gore and spooky mood are sheer gut-wrenching horror all the way. 2.) The plausibly drab and bleak depiction of a frightfully possible future. There's nothing slick or shiny about the future shown in this picture. It's truly grim and grimy, with the grungy set design, grubby costumes and rundown looking spaceship all contributing to one fascinatingly credible version of a future that seems just around the corner. The all-powerful company's cold assessment of the crew as expendable isn't too far removed from the world we currently live in -- a world in which greed and money take precedent over the basic worth ascribed to everyday human life. 3.) The gradual pace. While there are some folks who take issue with the methodically slow pace, said pace nonetheless is crucial to developing the almost unbearably substantial amount of suspense that really kicks into harrowing overdrive once the creature gets lose on the ship. It's the meticulous build-up of the first half which gives the second half of the film its considerable nerve-wracking impact and potency. 4.) The infamous 'chest-burster' scene. It's so supremely well-timed and staged, with highly believable mixed reactions from everyone involved in the scene. 5.) The uniformly superlative acting from a top-notch cast. Sigourney Weaver positively shines in her break-out star-making role as tough sole survivor Ripley, with stellar support from Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm, John Hurt, Veronica Cartwright, and the always terrific Harry Dean Stanton. 6.) Jerry Goldsmith's exceptional score. Ace composer Goldsmith chimes in with one of his most brilliantly spare and chilling scores ever. 7.) The thoroughly convincing warts'n'all human characters. The way the well-drawn characters bicker and interact with each other rings completely true throughout. 8.) The strikingly gloomy cinematography by Derek Vanlint gives this feature a supremely powerful dark'n'shadowy atmospheric look. 9.) The still quite sound and cogent special effects. Done prior to CGI, those miniatures have an organic quality to them that's extremely persuasive. 10.) That hideously vile, nasty and downright creepy alien itself. Sure, it's just a guy in a suit, but wow does that suit seem incredibly genuine and lifelike. 11.) Ridley Scott's faultless direction never wavers from start to finish, keeping the absorbing story on track while delivering plenty of jolts and cranking up the clammy claustrophobic tension to the often exhilarating ninth degree. Add all these sterling factors together and the net result is a simply spectacular motion picture that's wholly deserving of its classic status.",10,2,4,18 November 2007
Corpse Bride," A real delight
","Timid young Victor Van Dort (the always fine and personable Johnny Depp) is engaged to be married to the sweet and equally mousy Victoria Everglost (Emily Watson in peak charming form). Complications ensue when Victor accidentally weds the nice, lovely and radiant, but very much deceased corpse bride Emily (beautifully voiced with exquisite passion by Helena Bonham Carter). Directors Tim Burton and Mike Johnson, working from a bright and witty script by John August, Caroline Thompson and Pamela Pettler, concoct a deliciously quirky and inspired cinematic meditation on life, death, love, kindness, sacrifice, and mortality. Depp, Watson, and especially Carter all do sterling work as the appealing main characters; they get excellent support from Albert Finney as the grouchy Finis Everglot, Joanna Lumley as his similarly sour spouse Maudeline, Tracy Ullman as overbearing shrew Nell Van Dort, Paul Whitehouse as her meek husband William, and Richard E. Grant as smarmy, wicked nobleman Barkis Bittern. It's an immense pleasure to hear legendary Hammer horror veterans Christopher Lee as the mean, fearsome Pastor Galswells and Michael Gough as the wise Elder Gutknecht. The film further benefits from several wonderfully macabre touches like the groovy skeleton jazz band and a lovably grotesque Peter Lorreish maggot (a sublimely slimy Enn Reitel). The stop-motion animation is remarkably fluid and lifelike; Emily in particular has a genuine touching grace and sadness to her. A nice bit of irony can be discerned from how the living take being alive for granted while the dead enjoy an extremely merry afterlife. Danny Elfman's lush, melodic score, the divinely rich and vivid 19th century Gothic atmosphere, the incredibly catchy and funny songs, and Pete Kozachik's often stunning cinematography are all terrific as well. Despite the ghoulish premise, this picture proves to be strangely moving and even life-affirming. A total one-of-a-kind offbeat and uplifting treat.",9,0,0,22 June 2008
Predator," Big Arn takes on a formidable opponent in this superior sci-fi/action pip
","An elite commando squad led by the rugged Dutch (an excellent and engaging performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger) find themselves being hunted by a ruthless and relentless predatory alien (towering Kevin Peter Hill) in a Central American jungle.Director John McTiernan relates the gripping story at a snappy pace, stages the action set pieces with rip-roaring gusto, builds plenty of tension, delivers a handy helping of gore, and makes the most out of the steamy tropical setting. The clever script by Jim and John Thomas provides a hyper-masculine aesthetic that's positively dripping with testosterone along with several choice one-liners ('Stick around') and a welcome and refreshing opportunity to see a bunch of tough stomp-ass alpha male types placed in a disadvantageous situation in which they are vulnerable and getting bumped off instead of invincible and happily butchering folks. The members of Dutch's mighty team are a likable and well-drawn bunch, with especially stand-out work from Carl Weathers as the duplicitous Dillon, Bill Duke as the unhinged Mac, Jesse Ventura as rough'n'tumble redneck Blain, and Sonny Landham as expert tracker Billy. Kudos are also in order for Donald McAlpine's sharp cinematography, Alan Silvestri's fist-pumping score, and Stan Winston's superbly grotesque creature make-up. Essential viewing.",9,4,4,29 March 2016
The Hills Have Eyes," Worthy remake
","A suburban family who are driving cross country run afoul of a savage mutant clan in the middle of a remote desert. Director Alexander Ahja, who also co-wrote the hard-hitting script with Gregory Levasseur, brings a fierce take-no-prisoners attitude to the harsh and gripping premise, makes fine use of the desolate desert wasteland location, generates plenty of tension, takes time to develop the characters, adeptly crafts a few eerie moments (the crater filled with abandoned automobiles and a ramshackle house that's littered with mannequins rate as especially striking and unsettling set pieces), and delivers a handy helping of unflinchingly graphic gore. The sound acting from the able cast further keeps this film on track: Aaron Stanford as the wimpy Doug, Kathleen Quinlan as the spunky Ethel, Vinessa Shaw as the sweet Lynn, Emilie de Ravin as the perky Brenda, Dan Byrd as the sullen Bobby, and Tom Bower as a grizzled gas station attendant. Moreover, the mutants are quite grotesque and frightening, with Billy Drago as vicious patriarch Papa Jupiter, Robert Joy as the brutish Lizard, and Michael Bailey Smith as hulking beast Pluto registering strongly as the definite scary stand-outs. The startling moments of go-for-the-throat unsparing violence pack a ferocious punch. Both Maxime Alexandre's sharp widescreen cinematography and the shivery score by tomandandy are up to speed. A nice'n'nasty surprise.",8,4,6,18 October 2016
The Orphanage," A lovely, moving, and subtle Spanish horror winner
","Laura (a fine and affecting performance by Belen Rueda) and her family movie into a mysterious seaside orphanage that Laura grew up in as a child. Said orphanage harbors a deep dark secret that threatens to destroy both Laura and everything she has ever loved. Director J.A. Bayona eschews graphic gore and cheap scares in favor of delicately crafting a quietly spooky atmosphere that gets under the viewer's skin in an understated, yet still unsettling way. Moreover, the absorbing story that's set up with utmost care and precision by Sergio G. Sanchez has a tragic element to it that in turn gives this film a considerable amount of depth and poignancy. Rueda's distraught, yet determined Laura makes for a strong and sympathetic protagonist whose need to make peace with her troubled past and desire to be reunited with her missing son Simon (well played with tremendous charm and vitality by Roger Princep) ensures that this movie packs a potent emotional punch. The ending manages to be both sad and uplifting in equal measure. Fernando Cayo lends sturdy support as Laura's concerned husband Carlos. Geraldine Chaplin likewise excels as helpful medium Aurora. Kudos are also in order for Oscar Faura's sumptuous widescreen cinematography and Fernando Velaz's spare shivery score. A very touching and haunting gem.",9,0,2,29 March 2018
The Shining," An extended stay at the Overlook Hotel could cost you your sanity
","Aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson giving one of his most zestful and inspired full-tilt nutso performances) takes a job as caretaker of the large posh Overlook Hotel while it's closed for the winter off season. However, a maleficent supernatural presence in the hotel eventually drives Torrance dangerously around the bend.Director Stanley Kubrick relates the absorbing story at a leisurely, yet still hypnotic pace, makes excellent extensive use of the sprawling main location, says something profound and disturbing about the horrors of narcissism in which people are too self-absorbed to see the insanity going on in others around them until it's too late, further spruces things up with a wickedly funny sense of pitch-black humor, and adroitly crafts a powerfully intense, oppressive, and unsettling gloom-doom atmosphere that really gets under the viewer's skin.While Nicholson has been fiercely criticized for going way over the top as Torrance from the get go, Wacky Jack nonetheless deserves praise for totally throwing himself into the juicy role and provides a hugely entertaining spectacle when he completely flips his wig in the delirious last third. (It's also the key grim point of the picture that Torrance clearly isn't stable even at the beginning, but everyone else in his immediate proximity is too caught up in their own little worlds to realize the obvious about him.) Moreover, there are sterling contributions from Shelley Duvall as the mousy Wendy, Danny Lloyd as sensitive little boy Danny, Scatman Crothers as easygoing psychic cook Hallorann, Barry Nelson as polite manager Ullman, Philp Stone as the serenely pernicious Grady, and Joe Turkel as friendly bartender Lloyd. John Alcott's sumptuous cinematography boasts plenty of exquisitely fluid and elongated tracking shots. The rattling and majestic orchestral score by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind hits the spine-tingling spot. Essential viewing.",9,0,4,18 March 2019
No Country for Old Men," Almost a great movie
","Shrewd, resourceful Vietnam veteran Llewelyn Moss (the excellent Josh Brolin) stumbles across a bunch of dead bodies, a pick-up full of heroin, and a bag with two million bucks worth of drug money in it. Moss decides to take the bag. This in turn makes Moss the target of vicious and remorseless psychopath Anton Chigurh (a splendidly chilling performance by Javier Bardem), who engages in a lethal game of cat and mouse with Moss. Meanwhile, cagey, weary Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (the always fine Tommy Lee Jones) investigates and tries to find Moss before it's too late. Joel and Ethan Coen have expertly crafted a tense, gripping and understated crime thriller that for the most part works like gangbusters: the sterling performances from a sturdy cast, the bleak, fatalistic tone, Roger Deakins' crisp, striking cinematography, the startling outbursts of shockingly brutal violence, several inspired moments of pitch black humor (the scene between Chigurh and a befuddled gas station proprietor is an amusingly edgy little gem), Carter Burwell's spare, moody score, the vivid evocation of the dusty, desolate rural terrain and the everyday folks who inhabit the region, the provocative central theme about a dying code of honor and decency, and a few well-staged action set pieces (a protracted shoot-out between Moss and Chugurh in the empty dark streets of a small town rates as a definite exciting highlight) are all uniformly spot-on. Brolin, Bardem, and Jones all shine in their meaty parts, with Barden especially memorable as one seriously scary and nasty villain. Moreover, there are nice supporting turns by Woody Harrelson as cocky, amiable hoodlum Carson Wells, Kelly McDonald as Moss' sweet, concerned wife Carla Jean, Garret Dillahunt as the eager Deputy Wendell, Tess Harper as Bell's sassy wife Loretta, and Barry Corbin as crusty, crippled old coot Ellis. WARNING: Possible *SPOILERS* ahead. However, the film really falters in the annoyingly vague and meandering last third. Moreover, Moss gets abruptly bumped off in a most frustrating and dissatisfying way. That criticism aside, this is still a highly impressive and engrossing winner.",9,3,6,12 June 2008
The Princess Bride," An absolute treat
","A kindly grandfather (the always delightful Peter Falk) reads a classic fairytale to his sickly grandson (likable Fred Savage). Dashing farmhand Westley (a fine and charismatic Cary Elwes) has to save beloved fair maiden Princess Buttercup (a sweet and radiant performance by the lovely Robin Wright) from the vile clutches of evil, cowardly Prince Humperdinck (a nicely slimy Chris Sarandon). Westley is assisted by vengeful Spanish master swordsman Inigo Montoya (marvelously played with lip-smacking gusto by Mandy Patinkin) and hulking, but friendly behemoth Fezzik (a supremely amiable turn by legendary wrestler Andre the Giant). Director Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman deftly blend elements of comedy, romance, action and comedy into a charming and engaging whole that pokes warm and witty revisionist fun at the conventions of fairy tales in a winningly respectful and affectionate manner. The cast are all uniformly excellent in their colorful roles: Elwes and Wright make for extremely attractive and appealing leads, Patinkin has you rooting for his honorable vendetta all the way, Christopher Guest positively oozes smarmy malevolence as serenely wicked sadist Count Tyrone Rugen, Wallace Shawn is smug perfection as pompous sniveling intellectual toad Vizzini, plus there are terrific cameos by Billy Crystal as crotchety old magician Miracle Max, Carol Kane as his equally irascible wife Valerie, Mel Smith as an albino, and Peter Cook as a mush-mouthed clergyman. The gentle humor and pure, innocent, good-natured tone give this picture an extra irresistible kick. Best of all, there's a wonderfully uplifting and positive central message about the unbeatable power of true love. Kudos are also in order for Mark Knopfler's graceful, harmonic score and Adrian Biddle's golden, sparkling cinematography. A totally enchanting jewel.",9,3,8,9 April 2009
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Excellent and inspired horror comedy blast
","Redneck best buddies Tucker and Dale venture into the remote woods to fix up their rundown mountain vacation home. Things go horribly awry when the amiable duo are mistaken for murderous backwoods hillbilly psychopaths by a group of obnoxious college kids. Director/co-writer Eli Craig and co-writer Morgan Jurgenson ingeniously subvert and poke fun at the standard conventions and stereotypes associated with evil hicks in the sticks fright fare: The rednecks this time are hapless victims of unfortunate circumstance, the college kids are the judgmental and xenophobic villains of the piece, and the gruesome deaths of said college kids are the direct result of their own fear and stupidity. Better still, this picture makes a valid satirical point about the perils of buying into preconceived assumptions on people while still delivering plenty of tasty over-the-top graphic gore. Moreover, the fine acting by the bang-up cast keeps everything humming: Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk display a winningly loose and natural chemistry as the lovable good-natured protagonists, Katrina Bowden contributes a hugely appealing performance as the sweet Allison, and Jesse Moss brings a deliciously hateful zeal to his juicy role as belligerent frat boy jerk Chad. The crisp widescreen cinematography by David Geddess gives the movie an impressively polished and atmospheric look. The twangy'n'shivery score by Mike Shields hits the stirring spot. An absolute hoot.",8,0,0,20 June 2013
28 Days Later...," Beware of the infected ... and your fellow humans
","While this film didn't exactly reinvent the zombie horror genre, director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland nonetheless still manage to bring a feeling of jarring intimacy and immediacy to the standard premise by wisely focusing on a small handful of survivors who try to stay alive and retain residual traces of their humanity in an extremely dire and desperate situation. Indeed, Boyle and Garland handle the premise with admirable take-no-prisoners grim seriousness by showing in stark and chilling terms how easily people can degenerate into a horrible barbaric state in the wake of civilization collapsing. In an inspired cynical touch, a group of soldiers turn out to be anything but heroic and helpful as they prove to be more concerned with their own self-preservation over helping others out. Cillian Murphy makes for an engaging average guy protagonist as the fundamentally decent Jim, Noamie Harris provides plenty of spark as the sassy and ruthlessly determined Selena, Brandon Gleeson does typically fine work as affable cab driver Frank, and Christopher Eccleston likewise excels as the steely Major Henry West. A tense sequence in a tunnel rates as a definite harrowing highlight while the shots of a dead quiet and empty London are quite eerie and striking. Anthony Dod Mantle's rough digital cinematography gives this picture a gritty sense of documentary-style realism. But it's the way this film manages to keep things on a basic human level which in turn makes the horror presented herein so potent and unsettling.",8,1,3,11 January 2018
It Follows," If you do it, It will come after you
","19-year-old Jay Height (a fine and sympathetic performance by Maika Monroe) has sex with the mysterious Hugh (an effectively antsy portrayal by Jake Weary) in the back seat of his car. Unbeknownst to Jay, Hugh was being relentlessly stalked by a deadly and persistent carnal supernatural force that's now after her.Writer/director David Robert Mitchell relates the inspired and absorbing story at a hypnotically gradual pace, grounds the fantastic premise in a believably mundane everyday reality, ably crafts a potently unsettling sense of pure flesh-crawling dread and unease, and offers an original otherworldly demon which could very well represent a fatal sexually transmitted disease ala AIDS, the deep-seated fear and inevitability of death, and even the feelings of guilt and shame that the puritanical American culture ascribes to people engaging in intercourse for pleasurable purposes. Moreover, this film's strangely timeless quality adds immensely to its overall eerie and unnerving atmosphere while the fact that the demonic force moves slow, but never gives up and seems unstoppable ensures that this picture is guaranteed to really get under your skin. In addition, there are sturdy supporting contributions from Lili Sepe as Jay's concerned sister Kelly, Daniel Zovatto as the decent Greg Hannigan, Keir Gilchrist as smitten nerd Paul, and Olivia Luccardi as the gawky Yara. The crisp cinematography by Mike Gioulakis makes masterful use of the widescreen format. Rich Vreeland's shivery synthesizer score hits the pulsating shuddery spot. An on the money creepy and disquieting chiller.",9,0,0,27 September 2017
Velvet Goldmine," An excellent and exciting late 90's rock drama about the funky 70's glam-rock scene
","A dazzlingly brash and spunky work of fiction that has an engagingly loose basis in fact, this terrifically dynamic rock drama centers on the sparkling, glittery, outrageously camp and hedonistic anything-goes uninhibited lunacy of the 70's glam-rock phenomenon. It's chiefly about legendary mercurial David Bowie-like glam-rock god Brain Slade (the strikingly charismatic Jonathan Rhys Meyers), who at the peak of his popularity notoriously faked his own audacious on-stage assassination death and subsequently vanished altogether from public view. Ten years later former glam-rock fan turned successful British investigative journalist Arthur Stuart (excellently played by Christian Bale) is assigned by his editors to write a story on Slade, so Stuart tracks down Slade's old pals and associates to find out the exact reasons for his sudden disappearance.Todd Haynes' spirited direction and smart, witty, precisely etched script relate the compelling story in tricky flashback fashion, tracing Slade's humble beginnings and upward ascent to glam-rock superstardom with provocative insights into how glam-rock rode the crest of the swingin' 70's sexual revolution, glam-rock's deliberate attempt at erasing gender lines that separate men and women, the wanton bisexuality, gleeful decadence, bold androgyny, and flamboyant excesses that were fundamental components of glam-rock, and how being famous blurs the distinction between private life and public life. Gorgeously shot in loud, splashy, yet still elegant bright colors by Maryse Alberti, with a moody score by Carter Burwell and a marvelously ornate and melodic glam-rock soundtrack, the film lavishly evokes glam-rock's gloriously gaudy and theatrical over-the-top style in deliciously thorough and baroque detail. Although Rhys Meyers' spellbinding portrayal of Slade clearly dominates the picture, there are equally impressive turns by Toni Collette as Slade's bawdy, sassy American wife, Ewan McGregor as crazed, grungy Iggy Poppish garage hard rock maniac Curt Wild, and Eddie Izzard as an aggressively brazen record company executive. Intelligent and animated, 'Velvet Goldmine' works wonderfully well as a highly exciting and incisive cinematic ode to an especially thrilling and colorful 70's rock movement.",9,3,6,21 July 2006
I Am Legend," Comes perilously close to hitting a complete bull's eye
","Resourceful and determined scientist Robert Neville (a fine and credible performance by Will Smith) does his best to keep his sanity and find a cure for a deadly contagion that has either wiped out most of mankind or turned the ones who are left into murderous nocturnal mutants.Director Francis Lawrence, working from a compact and compelling script by Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman, keeps the absorbing story moving along at a constant pace, brings an impressive sense of tremendous scope to the premise (the expansive shots of an empty and desolate New York City are extremely striking and jarring), and ably crafts a powerfully unsettling mood of pure dread and despair. Moreover, the strong bond between Neville and his fiercely loyal canine companion Sam (well played by the beautiful German Shepherds Abbey and Kona) gives this film plenty of touching heart and warmth. Smith plays it serious and straight for once with remarkably spot-on results, Alice Braga lends sturdy support as soulful survivor Anna, Dash Mihok cuts an appropriately fearsome figure as the savage lead alpha male mutant, and Emma Thompson has a nice uncredited bit role as the well-meaning doctor whose cancer cure inadvertently beget the virus. Kudos are also in order for Andrew Lesnie's sharp widescreen cinematography and James Newton Howard's spare chilling score. Alas, the CGI creatures and wild animals look really cartoonish and unconvincing while the bittersweet ending fails to wrap things up in a satisfying manner. Those flaws aside, this film overall sizes up as a real on the money sci-fi/horror end-of-the-world winner.",8,2,4,10 January 2017
A Quiet Place," Silence is especially golden when it's essential to staying alive
","A close-knit family do their best to survive in a nightmarish world in which lethal monsters with acute hearing track people through sound and subsequently kill them. Director/cowriter John Krasinski puts a refreshing emphasis on the desperate sympathetic characters and ably crafts an edgy tone that's fraught with a tremendous amount of almost unbearable tension. Moreover, since the story is related on a small scale, the movie possesses a strong sense of raw intimacy that in turn gives the overall picture a surprising surplus of poignancy: The way the family all work together to keep each other alive is genuinely touching to behold and hence ensures that this film is both scary and moving in equal measure. Krasinski and Emily Blunt are terrific as the resolute parents of several children who are determined to keep them safe and out of harm's way as much as they possibly can. Millicent Simmonds contributes a remarkably expressive and impressive performance as a young deaf girl (Simmonds is deaf in real life). The creatures are quite ferocious and frightening. Charlotte Bruus Christensen's beautiful cinematography provides a wealth of stunning visuals while Marco Beltrami's rattling score hits the shivery spot. An excellent and often nerve-wracking winner.",9,26,53,10 April 2018
Ghostbusters," Still hilarious and immensely entertaining after all these years
","I first saw this film in a theater at age twelve way back in 1984. I absolutely loved it and enjoyed it a great deal. I vividly recall the audience roaring with laughter at regular intervals. Well, I rewatched this movie after having not seen it for at least fifteen years and boy did it ever hold up. It's partly because of the witty and ingenious blending of a Lovecraftian the end of the world as beget by ancient and powerful phantasmagoric beings premise with a delightfully broad and playful sense of infectiously irreverent and anarchic humor, partly because the special effects are extremely impressive and accomplished even by today's more sophisticated standards (the gluttonous Slimer in particular is a splendidly disgusting wow!), partly because the movie breezes along at a brisk clip without any dreary lulls, and mainly because it's just so much incredibly off-the-wall absurdist fun.The cast is sheer perfection: Bill Murray lands a plumb part as the lovably smarmy Dr. Peter Venkman, Dan Aykroyd is likewise excellent as the overzealous Dr. Raymond Stantz, Harold Ramis plays it suitably solemn and humorless as the deliciously dour Dr. Egon Spengler, Sigourney Weaver is simply ravishing as fetching musician and appealing love interest Dana Barret (and man is she smoking hot when she becomes possessed by the lascivious spirit of the evil, yet enticing Zuul), Rick Moranis exquisitely nerds it up as hopelessly dweeby accountant Louis Tully, Annie Potts adds considerable spark as sarcastic secretary Janine Melnitz, Ernie Hudson is quite engaging as the easygoing Winston Zeddmore, and William Atherton makes for a marvelously smug foil as obnoxious EPA jerk Walter Peck. Ivan Reitman's deft direction maintains an appropriately zany tone throughout while tossing in plenty of neat throwaway gags and culminating in one rousing doozy of a pull out all the stops crazy apocalyptic climax. Among the choice gut-busting moments are our protagonists attempting to nab a pesky ghost at a library, the Ghostbusters corny TV commercial, our boys' first assignment at a posh New York hotel, Stantz's erotic dream, and the first appearance of a giant deadly marshmallow man. Kudos are also in order for the first-rate rockin' soundtrack, with Mick Smiley's hypnotic 'Magic' rating as an especially awesome tune. Elmer Bernstein supplies a fantastic spooky and spirited score. Laszlo Kovacs' glossy cinematography makes fine use of the widescreen format. Popping up in nifty bits are Jennifer Runyon, Michael Ensign, 'Playboy' Playmate Kymberly Herrin, slinky Russian beauty Slavitza Jovan (as Gozer), Deborah Gibson, and even notorious porn star Ron Jeremy. But what really clinches this picture's status as an all-time classic 80's winner is its exceptionally inspired and energetic sense of blithely ridiculous merriment. A total treat.",10,2,3,13 September 2009
Slap Shot," A hilariously raucous and raunchy sports comedy treat
","This wonderfully wild, riotous, raucous and raunchy humdinger about the blithely amoral do whatever you gotta do in order to win hyper-masculine sports mentality was an undeserved box office bomb when it was first released in '77, but has since rightly amassed a sizable cult following which considers the film to be one of the best, funniest, most gleefully rough'n'rowdy sports comedies ever made.The Charleston Chiefs are a strictly mediocre hockey team who invariably lose one game after another. Audience interest in the Chiefs is rapidly dwindling and their no-account, conniving cheapskate owner Joe McGrath (an excellent, uproarious comic turn by the late, great Strother Martin) informs them that their current season will also be their last one. Paul Newman gives one of his finest, most enjoyably down'n'dirty performances to date as Reggie Dunlop, an aging, womanizing, chronically infantile veteran player/coach who leads the team on a sudden winning streak by inciting his crude, childish, insecure fellow players to use every last petty, loathsome, audience pleasing illegal trick in the book when playing against rival teams. Pretty soon the Chiefs are back on track and on their way to a big championship game with Reggie's formally sagging career on the up and up.Directed in a terrifically adroit and punchy fashion by George Roy Hill, who makes the most of Nancy Dowd's coarse, astute, smack dead on the money barbed script, edited with fluid swiftness by Dede Allen and shot with tremendous invigorating élan by Victor Kemplar (the bang-up all-out hockey games seriously smoke), this boisterous and often sidesplitting dilly offers a marvelously pointed and frequently hilarious critique of the puerile, silly and actually quite pathetic overgrown kid mentality evident in both the fiercely competitive athletic macho guy mentality and cheerfully dumb, maturity be damned bull-headed machismo in general. However, despite the picture's acrid edge, the Chiefs still manage to be a nice, charming bunch of idiosyncratic manly man bozos; my favorite moment is when our jock heroes occasionally make a few raw, angry comments about a soap opera they're all watching together in a bar! Moreover, the cast is uniformly first-rate: Michael Ontkean as a touchy college grad who disapproves of Newman's boorish tactics, Lindsay Crouse as Ontkean's fiery, irascible, dissatisfied wife, Jennifer Warren as Newman's patient, neglected wife, Melinda Dillon as the flighty Suzanne, who's one of Newman's many sexual conquests; Jeff Carlson, Steve Carlson and David Hanson as the moronic, barbaric, bespectacled Hanson Brothers (watching these geeky maniacs pulverize the opposing teams with their ferocious anything-goes tactics is an amazing gut-busting sight to behold), M. Emmet Walsh as local sports journalist Dickie Dunn, Swoosie Kurtz as one of the player's chatty, catty wives, Andrew Duncan as smarmy, motor-mouthed hometown sports announcer Jim Carr, and Paul Dooley as a rival team's hometown emcee are all fantastic. Ontkean's climactic striptease on the ice rink is a definite comic highlight. Brash, profane and hysterically unruly, 'Slap Shot' overall rates as an absolute hoot and a half.",9,7,9,11 December 2006
Children of Men," An excellent, exciting and above all intelligent bleakly futuristic science fiction winner
","2027: Society has collapsed into total violent anarchy and no children have been born in the last eighteen years. Glumly indifferent Theodore Faron (a superb Clive Owen) gets shocked out of his morose apathy when his underground revolutionary ex-wife Julian Taylor (the always fine Julianne Moore) enlists his aid to get the miraculously pregnant Kee (beautifully played by radiant newcomer Claire-Hope Ashitey) out of the country before the authoritarian government finds out about her. Director/co-writer Alfonso Cuaron brilliantly creates a plausibly bleak and depressing future where chaos is the dismal norm and mankind has lost its ability for hope. Cuaron wisely downplays needless flashy special effects in favor of emphasizing both the intriguing plot and equally interesting complex characters; he brings a sense of true heartfelt emotion and heartbreaking tragedy to the picture that's both poignant and powerful. The sparingly used special effects are seamless and convincing. The action sequences are fast, brutal, thrilling and harrowing as all hell. The uniformly terrific acting from a top-rate cast rates as another substantial asset: Owen delivers a very strong and touching portrayal of a man who regains his capacity to care and feel, Moore shines in her regrettably brief role, Ashitey brings a terrifically brassy'n'sassy strength and humor to her part, and Michael Caine is simply wonderful as Jasper, a blithely irreverent dippy hippie pothead who helps Theodore out when he's on the lam from the police. But what truly makes this movie so special, resonant and remarkable is its thoughtful and affecting central message about the immeasurable value of human life. A real lovely and extraordinary gem.",9,15,28,14 January 2007
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Simply delightful
","Leave it to the wildly imaginative Tim Burton to come up with the brilliant idea of combining the radically contrasting holidays of Christmas and Halloween into a single hugely creative and entertaining movie that's done with a considerable amount of genuine heart and loads of cheerfully morbid dark humor. Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, is bored with celebrating October 31st all the time. So Jack decides to take a crack at Christmas instead with predictably disastrous results. Director Henry Selick, working with a bright script by Caroline Thompson and Michael McDowell, does an expert job of vividly realizing an utterly believable and enchanting fantasy world populated with colorful oddball characters and a truly enchanting sense of pure wonder. This world and its kooky inhabitants possess a playfully macabre charm uniquely its own; the whole thing has a certain endearing quirky appeal that's impossible to either resist or dislike. The cast voice the characters with immensely infectious enthusiasm: Danny Elfman provides the glorious singing voice of Jack (Elfman also did the terrifically robust score and wrote the highly catchy and witty lyrics for the songs), Chris Sarandon acquits himself well as Jack's distinguished speaking voice, plus there's sturdy contributions from Catherine O'Hara as sweet, smitten, sensible ragdoll Sally, William Hickey as marvelously grotesque crippled scientist Dr. Finklestein, Glenn Shadix as the jolly and hearty two-faced mayor, and Ken Page as supremely mean and evil ghost villain Oogie Boogie. Inspired moments abound: Jack gamely trying (and failing) to explain the concept of Christmas to the creepy citizens of Halloween Town, a gang of wicked brats accidentally abducting the Easter Bunny, and Jack's hilariously twisted mess that he makes of the merry yuletide season. The stop-motion animation is exquisitely fluid, dynamic, and convincing. Pete Kozachik's crisp cinematography makes the picture positively beautiful to look at. Better still, we even get a relevant message about sticking to what you know and do best. Why, there's also a pleasant love story between Jack and Sally to give the film extra poignancy. A total treat.",9,0,1,15 April 2010
Guardians of the Galaxy," A total blast
","Director/co-writer James Gunn manages to deftly blend witty humor, rousing action, touching drama, and full-tilt go-for-broke imaginative fantasy into one hell of an infectiously enjoyable cinematic cocktail that not only delivers on the dazzling grand scale spectacle, but also has plenty of moving human (and alien) moments amid all the fancy CGI pyrotechnics. What makes this film so special and appealing is the tremendous feeling of loyalty and camaraderie amongst the colorful and likable misfit protagonists: They're a scrappy ragtag bunch who initially don't seem that decent or heroic, but in the long run prove they got the right courageous stuff to qualify as true guardians of the galaxy. Chris Pratt makes for an engaging and charismatic lead. Zoe Saldana likewise shines as one tough and formidable gal. Dave Baustita provides loads of brawny charm as the vengeful Drax. Vin Diesel's throaty rumble fits perfectly for gentle giant sentient tree Groot ('I am Groot'). Michael Rooker has an absolute ball as the fearsome leader of a gang of interstellar pirates. Moreover, such familiar faces as Glenn Close, John C. Reilly, Bernicio Del Toro, and Gregg Henry acquit themselves well in neat secondary roles. Stan Lee and Lloyd Kaufman pop up in amusing cameos. However, it's Bradley Cooper's exemplary vocal work as the resourceful and quick-thinking raccoon Rocket who almost steals the whole show; Cooper projects both a fierce sense of sharp sarcastic humor and a genuinely surprising vulnerability as this lovable mutant rodent. Alas, Lee Pace's petulant Ronan rates as a rather blah central villain, but fortunately Karen Gillian as the bitter Nebula compensates for this. The choice soundtrack of 70's rock gems and a wealth of inspired pop culture references -- love that Howard the Duck cameo at the very end! -- add immensely to the overall irresistibly spirited merriment.",9,2,8,3 September 2014
The Evil Dead," A pretty crude and rough, but undeniably effective little 80's splatter horror shocker
","Okay, we all know the plot to this one backwards and forwards, so I'm not going to bother with an unnecessary synopsis here. Instead, I'll just give this endearingly ragged early 80's splatter horror indie landmark all the props that it deserves. Granted, Bruce Campbell's acting leaves a bit too be desired (he's much better in the second one), the make-up f/x are pretty primitive, and the production values are a tad chintzy and cheesy, but there's no denying the sheer infectious abundance of pure brio, passion, energy and enthusiasm which permeates every last gloriously gonzo frame. Sure, money can buy slicker production values and fancier special effects, but all the money in the world can't and won't compensate for a severe dearth of heart and soul. This is the secret to this admittedly scrappy movie's remarkably enduring cult appeal and grungy charm; you can tell everyone involved in this deliciously demented delight put their proverbial all into the film. Moreover, the roughness of the film itself gives the movie a substantial raw, rattling, unrelenting power and intensity that a bigger budget and slicker execution would have only detracted from. Yeah, it's got its faults, but said flaws aside it still does the kick-you-in-the-gut jolting and startling trick to this very day.",9,3,7,17 April 2006
Black Snake Moan," Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricci are both outstanding in this strong and poignant tale of sin and redemption
","Reclusive and angry former blues singer turned farmer Lazarus (superbly played by the always excellent Samuel L. Jackson) is in a hurting way after his wife Rose leaves him after twelve years of unhappy marriage. Brassy and tormented trampy white trash nymphomaniac Rae (a remarkably raw and startling performance by Christina Ricci) sure ain't feeling too good, either. Lazrus finds Rae's battered body on the side of the road. After nursing her back to health, Lazarus chains Rae to his radiator in order to help the troubled lass overcome her demons. Writer/director Craig Brewer uses the potentially lurid and tasteless premise to spin a surprisingly potent and poignant tale of sin, redemption and the intrinsic fallibility of human nature. Rae and Lazarus are two lost and broken souls who help each other heal and become whole again. Jackson and Ricci are terrific in the leads, with equally strong support from Justin Timberlake as Rae's loyal, long-suffering boyfriend Ronnie, S. Epatha Merkerson as Lazarus' helpful lady friend Angela, John Cothran Jr. as the compassionate Reverend R.L., and onetime 70's child actress Kim Richards as Rae's bitter estranged mother Sandy. The vividly brooding and flavorsome Southern Gothic atmosphere, Amy Vincent's polished cinematography, Scott Bomar's moody score and the first-rate soulful blues soundtrack are all likewise on the money as well. As an added treat, Jackson growls out a few fantastic get-down gritty blues numbers and Ricci even sings a touchingly sweet rendition of the gospel tune 'This Little Light of Mine.' Offbeat, inspired and original, 'Black Snake Moan' overall qualifies as an extremely moving, compelling and provocative winner.",8,7,13,4 March 2007
Drag Me to Hell," Sam Raimi makes a triumphant return to the horror genre
","After spending the bulk of the decade making one overblown 'Spiderman' movie after another, Sam Raimi finally returns to the horror genre where he got his start. Thankfully, the long wait was worth it, for Raimi brings back the same sense of gleefully ghoulish fun and wickedly dark gallows humor that distinguished the 'Evil Dead' pictures. Sweet, but eager and ambitious bank loan officer Christine Brown (a fine and sympathetic performance by the adorable Alison Lohman) refuses to help out elderly gypsy woman Ms. Ganush (a marvelously grotesque portrayal by Lorna Raver) by granting her an extension on her home. Ms. Ganush, angry and humiliated, puts a curse on Christine: A powerful spirit will claim her soul after tormenting her for three days. Can Christine find a way to break the curse in time? Of course, the plot is admittedly pretty silly (the stuff with the pesky possessed handkerchief in particular is positively sidesplitting!), but luckily Raimi has an absolutely field day piling on the deliciously disgusting gross-out moments with infectiously giddy aplomb (revolting highlights include a fly going up Christine's nose, Christine suffering a severe nosebleed at work, Ms. Ganush's corpse spilling embalming fluid into Christine's mouth, and a possessed man vomiting up the corpse of a slain kitten). The PG-13 rating is pushed as far as it can go, with a pleasing amount of unapologetic in-your-face ickiness compensating for the lack of hardcore graphic gore. Better still, the cast play their parts with admirable sincerity: Lohman makes for a fetching and appealing lead, Raver is impressive as one extremely creepy and nasty hag who still elicits some pity because she's a victim of ill health and poverty, Justin Long contributes an engaging turn as Christine's loyal and concerned college professor boyfriend Clay Dalton, and Dileep Rao shines as helpful spiritual expert Rham Jas. Christopher Young provides an appropriately roaring and dynamic score while Peter Demming's polished cinematography boasts lots of wild angles and hyper-kinetic camera movements. The special effects are very effective and outlandish. The startling downbeat ending packs one hell of a punch to the gut. Okay, we're not exactly talking all-time classic here, but boy does this entertainingly over-the-top hoot deliver the blithely grody goods all the same.",8,2,6,10 June 2009
Grindhouse," A terrifically trashy tribute to cheerfully low-grade 70's exploitation cinema
","Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show. Tonight for your viewing pleasure we have two blithely low-rent Grade B items on a single hugely entertaining double bill.'Planet Terror' - A zombie epidemic breaks out in a dusty backroads Texas armpit community. A motley assortment of folks have to fight their way through a teeming mass of lethal hideous ghouls to safety. Writer/director Robert Rodriguez deftly maintains a constant breakneck pace throughout, gleefully pours on the revolting gross-out gore, and stages the nonstop explosive action with exhilarating aplomb. Rodriguez also perfectly nails the lovably shoddy quality of your standard two-cent schlocky horror splatter romp: the hilariously hokey dialogue, cheesy pulsating synthesizer score, raw, grainy, scratched-up cheap film stock, and in-your-face unflinching graphic violence are a total tacky treat to behold. The lovely Rose McGowan has a ball as Cherry, a down-in-the-dumps stripper (oops .. I mean go-go dancer) who has a leg she loses to the zombies replaced with a handy combo machine gun and grenade launcher. The rest of the uniformly excellent cast play their engagingly cardboard characters to the juicy hilt: Freddy Rodriguez as ace two-fisted survivalist Wray, Micheal Biehn as a hard-nosed sheriff, Bruce Willis as a mysterious general, Jeff Fahey as a grizzled diner owner, Stacy Ferguson as an ill-fated motorist, Tom Savini as a bumbling deputy, Josh Brolin as an evil doctor, Quentin Tarantino as an odious would-be rapist, Michael Parks as a rugged Texas ranger, and Marley Shelton as Brolin's faithless wife. This one gets an A+.'Deathproof' - Murderous misogynistic maniac Stuntman Mike (deliciously played with demented relish by Kurt Russell) gets his depraved jollies out of killing beautiful young women with his souped-up black muscle car (both the adorable Jordan Ladd and McGowan pop up as two of Mike's victims). Mike more than meets his match when he chooses luscious Rosario Dawson, fiery Tracie Thoms, and the incredible Zoe Bell as his next targets. Writer/director Quentin Tarantino starts the film out slow, ably developing the female characters so we honestly care about what happens to them. The opening third is a might dull and talky, but it culminates with a simply spectacular tire-screeching, metal-mangling, rubber-shredding lump-in-your-throat wild and exciting protracted car chase that rates alongside 'Vanishing Point' (an obvious acknowledged influence) and 'Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry' as some of the best vehicular carnage to ever roar its stirring way onto celluloid. This baby earns an B+.The wraparound stuff: The faux drive-in trailers are mighty tasty indeed. The revenge opus 'Machete' starring Danny Trejo as the titular bad hombre comes across like the greatest 70's Charles Bronson flick Bronson alas never did. Eli Roth's so-sick-it's-sidesplitting early 80's seasonal slasher spoof 'Thanksgiving' really hits the gut-busting spot. Edgar Wright's equally uproarious 'Don't' will have you howling as well. Rob Zombie's 'Werewolf Women of the SS' qualifies as a complete outrageous riot, with nifty appearances by Udo Kier, Sybil Danning, Bill Mosely, Sheri Moon, Tom Towles and Nicholas Cage as Fu Mancho (!). My sole criticism is the unfortunate dearth of gratuitous nudity in the two main features. Gratuitous nudity was a principal base ingredient of 70's grindhouse swill, so its glaring absence in both pictures is a tad disappointing. That minor quibble aside, Rodriguez and Tarantino alike still overall deliver a delightfully down'n'dirty cinematic ode to the gloriously sleazy thrills'n'spills joy and vigor of vintage 70's exploitation fare.",9,3,8,8 April 2007
The Fly," One of those rare horror films that's both touching and terrifying in equal measure
","Awkward, yet brilliant and obsessive scientist Seth Brundle (superbly played by Jeff Goldblum) creates a teleportation machine that can transport objects from one pod to another. Things go terribly awry after Seth accidentally merges himself with a housefly. Moreover, his scared, but concerned journalist girlfriend Veronica Quaife (a fine and affecting performance by Geena Davis) decides to stay by Seth's side no matter what happens.David Cronenberg brings a commendable amount of depth, gravity, and maturity to the gripping story, with the doomed romance between the two main characters giving this picture a poignancy and resonance that makes it substantially more than just another creature feature or mindless splatterfest (although it has to be noted that this movie most definitely doesn't shy away from depicting the extreme mental and physical transformation of Brundle into a hideous mutant in an often shocking and unflinching explicit manner). Better still, the central premise serves as a potent metaphor for everything from cancer to drug addiction to how the ravages of time and age take a harsh toll on us all as we get older. Cronenberg and Charles Edward Pogue's take-no-prisoners uncompromising script deserves praise for having the strength of its bleak convictions -- there's no hokey happy ending to be found here -- and further adds inspired touches of black humor to stop this film from becoming too intolerable in its grimness. In addition, it's a nice touch to have Veronica's obnoxious and unlikable boss and ex-boyfriend Stathis Borans (a deliciously odious portrayal by John Getz) come through as a sort of hero at the shattering climax. Joy Boushel contributes a memorably sexy turn as slutty barroom pickup Tawny while Cronenberg has a neat cameo as a gynecologist in a startling nightmare sequence. The Oscar-winning special f/x by Chris Walas are quite convincing and revolting. Kudos are also in order for Mark Irwin's polished cinematography and Howard Shore's outstanding operatic score. Essential viewing for Cronenberg fans and 80's horror aficionados alike.",9,3,5,19 September 2016
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Grim, unpleasant, and upsetting, but still undeniably powerful and provocative
","Northern Italy in the mid-1940's. Several wicked and decadent fascist libertine bureaucrats round up nine teenage boys and girls in a remote villa. The innocent adolescents are subjected to 120 days worth of mental, sexual, and physical torture.Director/co-writer Pier Paola Pasolini and co-writer Sergio Citti use the harsh, yet gripping premise as a means to fiercely critique the gross abuse of power and authority (the rich elite villains are a truly hateful and sadistic lot), the intrinsic foulness of fascism, the corrupting influence of evil and amorality, and the extreme lengths people will resort to in the name of the survival (some of the kids rat out their fellow prisoners under the belief that it will better their chances of living through their grueling ordeal). Moreover, Pasolini presents all the sex and nudity in a highly clinical and detached manner, thus depriving said potentially erotic content of any arousing aspects and instead depicting the horrific pain, suffering, and degradation that the kids are subjected to in an unnervingly stark and unflinching way. Indeed, the pervasive atmosphere of uncompromisingly bleakness, nihilism, and depravity proves to be much more startling and disturbing than any of the atrocities committed throughout. Tonino Delli Colli's lush painterly cinematography, the soundtrack of elegant classical music, and the beautiful sets and costumes provide a jarring contrast to the appalling cruelty the adults display to their hapless cowering victims. Gut-churning and emotionally draining for sure, but recommended viewing for those with the stomach and stamina to handle it.",10,10,16,27 July 2016
Don't Breathe," Looks like these thieves picked the wrong blind guy to mess with
","A trio of thieves decide to break to break into the home of a blind man (superbly played with fierce intensity by Stephen Lang) who turns out to be very resourceful and hence quite dangerous.Director Fred Alvarez, who also co-wrote the tight script with Rodo Sayagues, relates the gripping story at a brisk pace, adroitly crafts plenty of nerve-wracking claustrophobic tension, and throws in a few dandy sick twists. Moreover, Alvarez brings an intriguing moral ambiguity to the picture by making the blind man someone who's anything but a harmless innocent cripple. Jane Levy as the desperate Rocky, Dylan Minnette as the antsy Alex, and Daniel Zovatto as the cocky Money all do commendable work in their roles, but this film clearly belongs to Lang's impressively ferocious and frightening portrayal of a sightless war veteran loner who's quite a nasty and scary piece of work. Pedro Luque's sharp and fluid cinematography provides a pleasing glossy sheen. The spirited shivery score by Roque Banos hits the rattling spot. An on the money nail biter.",8,0,0,24 October 2018
The Descent," A smart, scary and overall superb subterranean creature feature survivalist horror shocker
","A motley sextet of spunky and adventurous young British women embark on an exciting spelunking expedition into a heretofore neglected and unexplored Appalachian cavern. Things turn sour when they get trapped deep down in the bowels of the earth by a sudden cave-in. Things go from already really bad to much, much horribly worse when the ladies find out they are not alone: there's a lethal and hungry gaggle of blind, agile and savage carnivorous albino humanoid mutant beasts who relentlessly stalk and attack the endangered group. Writer/director Neil ('Dog Soldiers') Marshall wisely takes his time setting up the characters and the situation, carefully easing the viewer into the central narrative before hitting us with all he's got. And boy does he got loads to hit us with: Besides the intrinsically taut, arresting and unsettling premise, we also have plenty of shockingly raw, gruesome and visceral violence, truly spooky, ugly and grotesque monsters, a clammy, creepy and suffocatingly claustrophobic atmosphere which steadily intensifies as the film goes on, and one corker of a startling surprise ending. Moreover, Marshall is to be further commended for not making a thuddingly obvious and heavy-handed proto-feminist empowerment chick flick; there's no sisters are doing it for themselves type preaching to be found in a single moment of this film. Instead the female characters have not only their survivalist skills pushed to the limit, but also their bonds of friendship and loyalty put to the ultimate test. Watching these women either stick by or abandon one another during their harrowing ordeal gives this movie a truly disturbing, substantial and provocative edge, clearly showing how these kinds of punishing life-threatening circumstances bring out the best and worst in human beings. Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Mendoza, Saskia Mulder, Alex Reid, MyAnna Buring and Nora-Jane No one all give excellent and engaging performances, deftly creating believable and likable characters who you genuinely care about (Macdonald especially shines as the toughest and most fiercely self-reliant member of the group). Better still, the monsters in the film aren't done with that dreadfully phony and rarely convincing CGI; the filmmakers thankfully opted for using folks in highly effective and persuasive suits. But what truly makes this a terrific fright film knock-out is the admirable and wonderful marked emphasis on the interplay between the characters, thus ensuring that there's a fabulous abundance of heart and humanity as well as the expected (and wholly terrifying) chills and thrills. A simply stupendous movie that's absolutely essential viewing for horror fans the world over.",10,5,11,6 August 2006
Rosemary's Baby," Outstanding late 60's horror classic
","Rosemary Woodhouse (superbly played with aching vulnerability by Mia Farrow) moves into a new apartment with her self-centered struggling actor husband Guy (an excellent performance by John Cassavetes). Rosemary gets pregnant and soon begins to suspect that her friendly, yet eccentric neighbors are plotting something sinister against her and her baby.Writer/director Roman Polanski firmly grounds the gripping premise in a thoroughly plausible workaday reality, makes fine use of New York City locations, and adroitly crafts a spooky, yet subtle, understated, and ambiguous atmosphere rife with dread and unease. Moreover, Polanski leaves it up to the viewer to decide if the grim events in the story are indeed actually happening or all some kind of nightmarish hallucination caused by Rosemary's mounting paranoia and troubled state of mind. In fact, what makes this film so chilling and unsettling are that the bulk of things which occur in the narrative are within the realm of possibility as well as the devastating revelation that Guy was willing to betray Rosemary by making an unholy pact with the devil in exchange for achieving the success that he desperately yearns for.Ruth Gordon won a well-deserved Oscar for her delightfully quirky and vibrant portrayal of the flaky and pesky Minnie Castevet. The rest of the cast are just as splendid: Sidney Blackmer as the dapper Roman, Maurice Evans as the amiable Hutch, Ralph Bellamy as the avuncular Dr. Sapirstein, Victoria Vetri as the ill-fated Terry, Patsy Kelly as the kooky Laura-Louise, Elisha Cook Jr. as glum realtor Mr. Nicklas, and Charles Grodin as the unhelpful Dr. Hill. Kudos are also in order for William A. Fraker's slick cinematography and Krzysztof Komeda's supremely eerie lullaby score. Essential viewing.",9,3,8,23 August 2017
Crazy Heart," Jeff Bridges excels in this lovely and moving drama gem
","The always excellent and engaging Jeff Bridges deservedly won a Best Actor Oscar for his spot-on performance as Bad Blake, a burn-out and booze-sodden washed-up country singer/songwriter whose life and career has hit the skids: Blake has hardly a dime to his name, hasn't written a song in three years, and barely manages to keep himself afloat performing in bowling alleys and seedy bars. Things perk up when Bad meets and falls in love with Jean Craddock (beautifully played with winning warmth and nuance by Maggie Gyllenhaal), a sweet single mother and aspiring reporter. Can Bad overcome his alcoholism and get his life back on track before it's too late? Writer/director Scott Cooper expertly crafts an absorbing and affecting tale of regret, failure, hope, redemption, and second chances that never resorts to either cloying sentiment or overblown histrionics; instead this low-key and subtle film trusts the credible story, authentically grimy locations, gradual pace, and thoroughly believable everyday characters to basically do their jobs all by themselves sans any needless flashy razzle-dazzle. Of course, this picture wouldn't work without Bridges' first-rate acting; he brings a totally convincing lived-in quality, scruffy charm, and mesmerizing deep weariness to the role of Bad that never rings false for a minute. Moreover, Bridges even sings a few terrific country songs in a surprisingly solid and effective twangy voice. Bridges receives sturdy support from Gyllenhaal, Colin Farrell as Bad's grateful and more successful protégé Tommy Sweet, Robert Duvall as loyal friend Wayne, and Paul Herman as long-suffering agent Jack Greene. Jack Nation is simply adorable as Jean's cute four-year-old son Buddy. Kudos are also in order for Barry Markowitz's polished cinematography and the perfectly harmonic score by Stephen Bruton and T-Bone Burnett (the latter also co-wrote the superb Oscar-winning song 'The Weary Kind'). Highly recommended.",9,1,3,20 March 2010
30 Days of Night," An excellent, inspired and supremely unsettling vampire horror knockout
","A vicious clan of deadly vampires lead by the ferocious Marlow (a positively terrifying portrayal by Danny Huston) lay siege to the remote small town of Barrows, Alaska during a month long period of total darkness. Gallant Sheriff Eben Oleson (a fine and likable performance by Josh Hartnett), his feisty estranged wife Stella (well played by Melissa George), and a motley handful of others do their best to survive this nightmarish ordeal. Director David Slade makes the most out of the ingenious script by Steve Niles, Stuart Beattie, and Brian Nelson: the gripping story unfolds at a constant brisk pace, the suspense gradually builds to a harrowing fever pitch (the protracted sequence with the vampires killing all the townspeople is absolutely bloodcurdling), the bleak wintry landscape evokes a strong sense of isolation and vulnerability, the outbursts of savage violence are truly jolting, and the human characters react in a plausible way to their impossible situation. Moreover, the stellar acting by the sturdy cast qualifies as another significant asset: Harnett and George both excel in their roles, Huston makes for a perfectly malevolent head ghoul, plus there are sound supporting turns by Mark Boone Junior as the gruff, bearish Beau Brewer, Ben Foster as the deranged the Stranger, Mark Rendall as Eben's sweet younger brother Jake, Amber Sainsbury as the spunky Denise, Manu Bennett as the amiable Deputy Billy Kitka, Megan Franich as lethal vampiress Iris, Nathaniel Lees as the easygoing Carter Davis, Joel Tobeck as the hotheaded Doug Hertz, Elizabeth Hawthorne as gutsy diner owner Lucy Ikos, and Abbey-May Wakefield as a nasty little girl vampire. The vampires themselves are wonderfully vile and grotesque: they're hideously malformed subhuman beasts with long nails, pasty complexions, super human strength and speed, and their own odd guttural language. The striking cinematography by Jo Willems offers a wealth of amazing visuals while Brian Reitzell's hypnotically chilling score hits the shivery spot. But what really makes this fright feature such a winner is its grim, harsh, no-nonsense tone: the central protagonists are forced to make some hard choices in order to stay alive, the merciless vampires spare no one from their bloodthirsty wrath, and the film stays fiercely true to itself to the literal bitter end. A splendidly tough and gritty treat.",9,3,6,7 August 2008
A Hard Day's Night," A sheer delight
","The Beatles take England by storm as they travel from Liverpool to London so they can do a live performance on a television show. What makes this movie so special and enjoyable is the way it vividly captures the Fab Four when they were still pretty fresh, dynamic, and even fairly innocent; by having the Beatles wisely just be themselves this film manages to astutely nail the charming effervescent quality that made them stand out as a group. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr all display a winningly natural rapport and a tight camaraderie that's a joy to behold. Moreover, they all deliver a slew of sharp snappy one-liners with cheeky aplomb. Wilfrid Brambell nearly steals the whole show as Paul's mischievous grandfather. In addition, there are amusing supporting contributions from Norman Rossington as long-suffering manager Norm, John Junkin as hapless lackey Shake, Victor Spinetti as a pompous TV director, and Kenneth Haigh as a pretentious advertising executive. Alun Owen's sly script pokes wickedly hilarious fun at everything from the media -- the press conference sequence is a riot! -- to television to the Beatles themselves. Directed with tremendous gusto by Richard Lester, exploding with infectiously anarchic energy, and further galvanized by a bunch of wonderful songs, there's a vibrancy and spontaneity evident throughout that's downright impossible to either dislike or resist. A total treat.",10,3,3,11 July 2018
Con Air," Super fun and ridiculous 90's blockbuster actionfest
","Noble Army ranger and reformed parolee Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage is extremely likeable full-blown macho man mode) finds himself stuck on a plane with a bunch of dangerous criminals led by the notorious Cyrus the Virus (adroitly played with lick-smacking evil gusto by John Malkovich).Director Simon West keeps the delightfully outrageous story hurtling along at a breathless breakneck pace, maintains an engaging tongue-in-cheek tone throughout, and stages the wild and exciting action set pieces with tremendous go-for-broke brawny brio. Scott Rosenberg's witty script boasts a lot of snappy one-liners along with a wickedly funny sense of self-mocking sardonic humor.This film further benefits from a colorful and entertaining array of deliciously detestable villains: Ving Rhames as black militant Diamond Dog, Steve Buscemi as flaky and philosophical psycho Garland Greene, Nick Chinlund as the surly Billy Bedlam, M.C Gainey as easygoing good ol' boy pilot Swamp Thing, and Dave Chappelle as wisecracking lackey Pinball. Moreover, there are sound contributions from John Cusack as eccentric smartaleck US Marshalls agent Vince Larkin, Colm Meaney as bullheaded DEA agent Duncan Malloy, Mykelti Williamson as Poe's affable buddy Baby-O, Rachel Ticotin as sassy guard Sally Bishop, and Steve Eastin as sarcastic guard Falzon. The roaring and rattling score by Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin does the rousing trick. David Tattersall's glossy widescreen cinematography likewise hits the impressive polished spot. However, it's this movie's giddy willingness to go totally over the top and then some that makes it such a gloriously gonzo blast to behold.",8,1,1,7 June 2019
The Cannonball Run," Pure fun
","A diverse array of colorful eccentric folks participate in a wild and illegal cross country road race. Director Hal Needham, working from a brash script by Brock Yates, relates the simple and hugely enjoyable story at a constant zippy pace, maintains an utterly engaging breezy'n'easy loopy tone throughout, and stages the thrilling vehicular carnage with his trademark rip-roaring brio. Moreover, the all-star cast have a ball with the wacky material: Burt Reynolds effortlessly projects his customary amiable charm and plays beautifully well with Dom DeLuise, Farrah Fawcett looks positively radiant and brings a sweetly daffy appeal to her character, Roger Moore gleefully sends up his own slick'n'suave James Bond persona, legendary Rat Pack members Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. display a marvelously loose and natural chemistry as a pair of bogus priests, Jackie Chan provides American audiences with an early demonstration of his considerable martial arts prowess, Jamie Farr joyfully devours the scenery as a madcap sheik, Mel Tillis works uproarious wonders with his stutter, and Jack Elam almost steals the entire goofy show with his inspired off-the-wall portrayal of a creepy'n'kooky doctor of dubious pedigree. George Furth also hits the prissy bull's eye as the uptight killjoy nerd determined to stop the big race. Better still, luscious babes Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman show off loads of tasty cleavage while Valerie Perrine has a witty uncredited cameo as a sexy state trooper. Why, we even have neat bits by such familiar individuals as Bianca Jagger, John Fiedler, and Peter Fonda and Robert Tessier as a couple of belligerent rough'n'rowdy bikers. Cool rocking theme song by Ray Stevens, too. The good-natured sensibility ensures that this picture never becomes too crude or offensive. A total blast.",8,4,4,7 June 2013
Paths of Glory," Needlessly sacrificing other's for one's own glory
","Stanley Kubrick's potent anti-war classic comes down super hard on the intrinsic cruelty and unfairness of the bleakly efficient military machine in which the arrogant top brass are more concerned about enhancing their lofty statuses and saving face with the public than they care about the grim plight of the hapless common foot soldiers who are sent to certain deaths by being forced to carry out mpossible missions for the sake of said top brass's own overinflated egos and self-advancement within the ranks: One can't help but feel infuriated when the ruthlessly ambitious General Paul Mireau (a marvelously haughty portrayal by George Macready) orders his own men to be shot when they fail to follow through with taking a heavily fortified area. Indeed, Kubrick astutely captures not only the brutality of war, but also the frequent absurdity and futility of same in both the harrowing combat scenes and at the shattering climax in which three innocent men are executed just so those in charge can prevent themselves from feeling disgraced. Kirk Douglas contributes a wonderfully impassioned performance as the idealistic Colonel Dax, who makes a game, albeit fruitless attempt to defend several men under his command when they are brought up on charges of cowardice. Moreover, there are strong contributions from Ralph Meeker as the sarcastic Corporal Philippe Paris, Adolphe Menjou as the smug and calculating General George Broulard, Wayne Morris as craven drunk Lt. Roget, Richard Anderson as hard-nosed prosecutor Major Saint-Auban, Joe Turkel as the noble Private Pierre Arnaud, and Timothy Carey as sniveling undesirable Private Maurice Ferol. Kudos are also in order for Gerald Fried's rousing score and Georg Krause's beautifully fluid black and white cinematography. Essential viewing.",9,1,2,18 January 2018
The Purge," A taut and gripping thriller
","In the near future, all crime is perfectly legal for twelve hours on a single day of the year. The affluent Sandin family find themselves in great danger on purge night when they allow a bloodied stranger (well played by Edwin Hodge) who's the target of a murderous mob to seek shelter in their home. Writer/director James DeMonaco relates the fresh and compelling premise at a brisk pace, builds a tremendous amount of claustrophobic tension, ably crafts a dark grim tone which becomes more increasingly bleak and upsetting as the harsh story unfolds towards a shattering conclusion, and pulls out all the pulse-pounding stops for the harrowing last third. Moreover, this picture gains additional potency from its sharp and confrontational exploration of how American society favors the rich and thus puts the poor at a cruel disadvantage to be easily victimized by the upper class (in an especially bold and inspired touch, the stranger is ultimately revealed as a homeless war veteran), how pent-up rage and aggression gives people a frightening capacity for extreme violence and brutality, the alarming lengths a person is willing to go to save one's own life and protect your loved ones, and how 'cathartic' violence causes more problems than it solves. The excellent acting by the tip-top cast keeps the movie humming: Ethan Hawke as straight-arrow nice guy patriarch James Sandin, Lena Headey as James' concerned wife Mary, Max Burkholder as naive son Charlie, Adelaide Kane as sulky and rebellious teenage daughter Zoey, Arija Bareikis as sweet neighbor Mrs. Grace Ferrin, and Chris Mulkey as the jolly Mr. Halverson. Rhys Wakefield contributes a splendidly creepy and smarmy turn as a calm smooth-talking psycho preppie gang leader. Jacques Jouffret's slick widescreen cinematography makes expert use of shadowy lighting. Nathan Whitehead's spare shivery score does the nerve-rattling trick. A real tense and startling nail-biter.",8,4,9,29 November 2013
Cube," Bang-up indie sci-fi thriller winner
","Six complete strangers with nothing in common find themselves trapped in an intricate hi-tech maze of interconnected cubes armed with lethal booby traps. This motley group is forced to work together in order to figure a way out before they starve to death in a few days. As their situation becomes increasingly dire and desperate, the group starts to turn on each other and prove to be their own greatest enemies. Director Vincenzo Natali, who also co-wrote the ingenious, intriguing, and unpredictable script with Graeme Manson and Andre Bijelic, adroitly crafts a strong, gripping, and suspenseful shocker that's brimming with oodles of nerve-jangling claustrophobic tension, a sharp sense of amusingly cynical humor, a few nicely gross moments of nasty gore, an extremely edgy and paranoid atmosphere, and plenty of astute insights into how a crisis situation brings out both the best and the worst in human beings. Moreover, the filmmakers keep things pleasingly ambiguous throughout: We never learn who built the cube and exactly why these six people have been dumped inside it. This refreshing respect for the audience's intelligence gives this picture an extra potent and provocative edge. Kudos are also in order for the fine acting from the able ensemble cast: Nicole de Boer as perky college student mathematics whiz Leaven, Nicky Guadagni as bitter, high-strung doctor Holloway, David Hewlett as sarcastic office worker designer Worth, Andrew Miller as mentally handicapped idiot savant Kazan, Wayne Robson as wily escape artist Rennes, and, in an especially stand-out turn, Maurice Dean Wint as tough take-charge cop Quentin. Derek Rogers' agile and vertiginous cinematography makes the most out of the cramped and confined spaces. Mark Korven's shuddery score likewise does the shivery trick. Highly recommended.",9,1,2,26 February 2010
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Max returns with a vengeance
","Shell-shocked former cop Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy in peak rugged form) and tough warrior Imperator Furiosa (a fabulously fierce portrayal by Charlize Theron) join forces to protect a group of fertile women from the vile clutches of evil warlord Immortan Joe (robustly played to the monstrous hilt by Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his vicious minions.Director/co-writer George Miller keeps the lively and wildly entertaining story hurtling along at a relentless slam-bang pace, stages the thrilling action set pieces with rip-roaring brio, and brings a staggering sense of epic scope and crazy go-for-broke creativity to the infectiously over-the-top proceedings. Better still, Miller's tightly streamlined narrative pares everything down to the exciting bare essentials which in turn ensures that there isn't a single wasted frame or dull moment throughout. This movie earns extra points for its strong feminist stance in which a bunch of women who have been relegated to the status of property whose sole useful functions are either for reproduction or providing milk take a defiant stance against an oppressive patriarchy.Moreover, Max's struggle to regain his humanity and the redemptive character arc of the misguided Nux (a sturdy performance by Nicholas Hoult) give this picture extra depth and poignancy. This movie further benefits from a colorful array of outrageously nasty villains: Nathan Jones as dim-witted brute Rictus Erectus, Josh Helman as deranged War Boy follower Slit, John Howard as the grotesquely obese the People Eater, and Richard Carter as unhinged religious fanatic the Bullet Farmer. Kudos are also in order for John Seale's breathtaking widescreen cinematography and Junkie XL's dynamic pulsating score. An incredibly ferocious explosion of a film.",9,0,5,4 July 2017
The Breakfast Club," A highly astute and affecting portrait of 80's adolescent angst
","Five distinctive teenage archetypes -- competitive jock Andrew Clark (an excellent and engaging performance by Emilio Estevez), surly rebel John Bender (an intense and volcanic portrayal by Judd Nelson), flaky misfit Allison Reynolds (a delightfully kooky turn by the adorable Ally Sheedy), stuck-up popular gal Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald at her most radiant and captivating), and gawky nerd Brian Johnson (ably played with depth and nuance by Anthony Michael Hall) -- are forced to spend detention together on a Saturday. During the course of the day the kids let their guards down and reveal their true selves to each other. What makes this film so special, touching, and resonant is the smart and insightful way writer/director John Hughes sees beyond the restrictive superficial labels that society places on people in order to reveal that every one of these familiar teen 'types' is actually a flawed and complicated warts'n'all human being. Moreover, Hughes not only firmly states that no one person easily fits into a simple one-word category, but also manages to see the intrinsic frailty and humanity of all the main characters: For example, Bender initially comes across as an obnoxious and antagonistic jerk, but ultimately gets exposed as the enraged, yet pitiable toxic product of an abusive and dysfunctional home life. The uniformly top-notch acting keeps this movie on track: The five leads all do sterling work, Paul Gleason breathes fire and finds the wounded resigned heart beating underneath the boiling anger of mean authoritarian principal Richard Vernon, and John Kapelos makes a nice favorable impression as easygoing janitor Carl. Worthy of its lofty status as a landmark 80's teen classic.",9,1,1,18 March 2018
The Birds," Alfred Hitchcock's undeniably outstanding killer animal horror masterpiece
","I finally bought a copy of Alfred Hitchcock's undeniably outstanding killer animal fright film masterpiece on DVD and rewatched it. Although I've viewed it many times, 'The Birds' still managed to creep me out and make my hair stand on end as I saw it yet again. I think this alone serves a sterling testament to just what a remarkably strong and scary movie 'The Birds' truly is. Hitchcock's extremely meticulous and thus thoroughly believable evocation of a pedestrian everyday mundane world populated by ordinary, yet engaging and interesting true-to-life characters going about their usual business that's violently disrupted by the savage, shocking and inexplicable hostile attacks by every kind of bird qualifies as his major artistic triumph here. There's a conviction and plausibility evident in this film which makes it quite powerful and frightening in comparable measure. Moreover, the performances by the top-rate cast are uniformly outstanding (Tippi Hedren in her delightful film debut, the ever-rugged and appealing Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy and a very young Veronica Cartwright are all splendid), the inspired use of natural sound and conspicuous absence of a standard score is brilliantly effective, the bird attack sequences are stunningly harrowing and horrifying (the climactic night long siege on the house is an absolute tour-de-force of nerve-wracking terror and tension), and the amazingly convincing special effects remain impressive to this very day (Albert Whitlock's extraordinary matte paintings are simply spectacular). Fantastic chillingly ambiguous ending, too. If you haven't seen this one in some time I strongly advise that you watch it again. I'm absolutely certain it will still get under your skin as well.",10,2,4,9 May 2006
Evil Dead II," The rare sequel that's an improvement on the original
","As much as I love 'The Evil Dead,' I still must admit that it's a pretty crude and rough around the edges film. Granted, it's the ragged quality of the original which gives the movie its raw power. That said, I just have to say that the sequel qualifies as a genuine improvement; it's a much more assured and polished piece of go-for-broke crazy film-making with better acting, stronger production values, more impressive special effects, and a wickedly hilarious sense of jet black gallows humor. Bruce Campbell encores as Ash, who once again finds himself trapped in a remote woodland cabin that's besieged by ferocious evil demonic forces. Director/co-writer Sam Raimi never lets the whiplash-inducing frantic pace falter for a minute, offering a nonstop roller coaster ride of beautifully bent, batty and berserk cinematic mayhem that gleefully assaults the viewer's senses from start to finish. Peter Deming's fluid, darting, hyperactive cinematography ensures that this picture is a complete dazzling visual treat throughout. Joseph Lo Duca's spooky'n'spirited score likewise hits the spot. Moreover, Raimi really pours on the outrageously excessive graphic gore (blood literally flies everywhere in several scenes). Gruesome gonzo highlights Ash being attacking by a headless body wielding a chainsaw, Ash's possessed hand breaking dishes over his head, and an eyeball flying into a screaming woman's mouth. Campbell delivers a wonderfully amusing and animated performance as the intrepid Ash; he receives excellent support from Sarah Berry as feisty anthropologist Annie Knowby, Dan Hicks as scruffy redneck Jake, Kassie Wesley as sassy hillbilly gal Bobbie Joe, and Ted Raimi as the hideously grotesque possessed Henrietta. Great ending, too. All in all, this baby sizes up as a total groovy blast.",10,2,6,30 October 2007
