The Devil's Advocate," WOW! What a movie
","This the kind of movies that I would describe as 'Intelligent'. I prepared myself to leave the theater with the impression of a déjà-vu: a classical Faust-like story about a covenant with the Devil, but the last minute of the film changes everything and makes the movie really interesting. A few questions remain unanswered: Would a lawyer sell his soul? Why did the Devil choose to head a law firm? Is there a similarity between the two (Devil and Lawyer)? Does this mean that lawyers are Evil? The film tries to give an answer but it didn't convince me. Maybe the script writers were too diplomatic ;-D Al Pacino is superb, Keanu Reeves is snobbish, Charlize Theron is, well ... (no comments). A point in its favor: the movie handles the subject without any exaggerated special effects. The film features Senator D'Amato playing himself. I recommend that you go see the movie. Make sure to stay until the last minute.",Null,0,0,11 July 2000
The Patriot," Vote Gore
","It has been proven that Roland Emmerich makes good movies. It remains to be seen however, if those movies are milestones of modern film making.The Patriot, although lengthy at parts, is a good movie. It aims to shed a light on the birth of American history. As such it contains the usual clichÃ©s: Women's opinion was heard and respected (although later on women had to fight for their rights), white people respected their black slaves and were honored to have them fight and die for their cause, etc. I believe these fairy tales are necessary for any film to be politically correct and thus make a good performance in the box office. Speaking of box office, I think the most important factor in the success of the movie is Mel Gibson. His performance here is reminiscent of Braveheart and will surely make you forget about the minor discrepancies of the movie.Finally, I would like to add a small remark. The Patriot is Emmerich's second movie (after Independence Day) whose release coincides with US Elections, and here again the movie comes to the favor of the Democratic Party. Does this mean that Al Gore will become the next US President? Let us wait and see.",Null,0,1,21 August 2000
Mission: Impossible II," My Name is Hunt, Ethan Hunt
","You cannot enjoy this movie if you are an aficionado (like Iam)  of the TV series. What made the success of the TVseries was the quiet and steady method used by Jim Phelps to accomplish the mission he chose to accept. Action scenes were kept at a minimum to enhance the suspense and illustrate the clever plot. Both movie versions of Mission: Impossible are far away from the TVseries. I guess Tom Cruise wanted to do a 007-like movieand he came out with the idea of re-modeling Mission: Impossible for this purpose.MI2 contains all the ingredients of a James Bond movie:The super-spy himself who works alone (Cruise), his bossM (played here by Anthony Hopkins); Q, the hardware guy(Ving Rhames is the alter ego of the late Desmond Llewelyn); the Bond girl (Thandie Newton who strangelyreminded me of Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment); andlast but not least the car and motorcycle chase scenes.The analogy goes as far as Nyra asking Hunt : 'Who areyou?' and the reply comes naturally: ' My name is ...'.
Both movie versions of Mission: Impossible contain a strong and powerful message: All spies are villains. In bothmovies the evil man is a member of the IMF team. I wonderwhat made Anthony Hopkins have confidence in Tom Cruise if (almost) all his spies are potential traitors! Iguess we will have to wait for MI3 to find out.The action shots of the movie are well done. The exaggerated slow motion (c.f. Matrix) is there to clearlyshow us that it is Tom Cruise himself who is doing thestunts. Even the cliche of having the villain wake up (afterhe was believed to be dead) to deal the final coup to thehero is used to illustrate the prowess of Cruise as a stuntman.All in all, it is a good spy movie with a simple plot and a lotof action. It surely has nothing to do with Mission: Impossible.",Null,0,0,28 July 2000
Gladiator," A 'modern' Roman Epic
","Ridley Scott has done to Roman Epics what Steven Spielberg did for WW II movies: destroy all the traditional cliches and bring a more realistic approach to the subject.What most impressed me was the realistic portrayal of the fights making us realize that violence is not an entertainment.The high quality of the production is reflected in every single detail: from the shining face mask of the gladiator to the giant coliseum, passing by a bird's-eye view of Rome that the Romans themselves couldn't even see, to the splendid illustrations of the atrocities of the arenas and the battlefields.The plot is just like what one would expect from such movies. The message is simple: Loyalty and honor are worth fighting for.Everyone should see Gladiator and enjoy the wonderful acting and the marvelous special effects.",9,0,0,7 July 2000
