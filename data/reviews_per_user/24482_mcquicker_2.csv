Marie Antoinette," Evidence that in Hollywood Ignorance is a Virtue
","This movie is an example of how silly ol' Hollywood should stick to creating movies about cowboys and Indians and not wander into the realm of serious history.Marie Antoinette is devoid of historical accuracy and its only plus are the sumptuous costumes and locations.Even the music makes no sense. Why would anyone score a movie about the French Queen with Italian Vivaldi and modern rock? This flick is as dull as they come, the dialog is silly and the script sillier, still.Not worth spending watching either at home or anywhere else.Peter Bond",2,1,3,15 March 2007
Disturbia," Close the Window! (Caution - Some spoilers)
","This movie is OK if you want to spend a couple of hours trying to outguess the writer or the director.As a thriller, well, it's sort of silly.What is incredibly absurd is that someone would actually go into the house of a man thought to be a serial killer. You really have to be extremely stupid or just a terrible character in a poorly written plot.------------------- Spoiler ahead? -------------- The other absurdity in this flick is that you have a fellow who is killing women right and left and yet...he allows the curtains in his house to be wide open so anyone from outside can look in! Doesn't make sense at all and for me, at least, it killed the film.",4,22,36,6 August 2007
