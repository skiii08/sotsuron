Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Masterpiece is a Masterpiece is a Masterpiece!
","I just had an emotional reaction to this film that was not crying, though you may call that physical. I have only watched three films back to back due to their unexplainable genius, two were Tarantino films, Kill Bill Vol. 2 was one of them, the other was Pulp Fiction. Every thing was perfect down to the last word, down to the last song (I mean, 'Malague√±a' wow!). Uma just exudes natural power that is so non-gender. Her acting alone had me standing on the Hattori Hanzo sword from beginning to end. But every character was amazing, even the well explained snake.I saw no error in this film, so this is all flattery, to which I hope Mr. Tarantino is susceptible to.",Null,0,1,16 August 2004
