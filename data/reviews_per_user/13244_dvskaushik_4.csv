Iron Man 3," There's only one Tony Stark/Iron Man and that RDJr
","I am Iron man - Iron Man 1 I have successfully privatized world peace - Iron Man 2 And whats the iconic dialogue for iron man 3? Before the question is answered lets see whats THREE all about.Shane Black the screenwriter behind Lethal Weapon, Last Boy Scout and director for Kiss Kiss Bang Bang along with RDJ then, once again proves his mettle along with the actor for incorporating his antics allover in the film. RDJ excels himself in the role because there's no one else. Damn he has to renew his contract with Marvel.As we have seen until now it seems that MCU is going thru the Marvel Comics Civil War comic series but i have no interest in divulging the details as the plot for the Phase 2 seems to be going very well now as the first movie for this phase has been delivered in aces. It seems that marvel is choosing its directors for this phase cleverly.damn you warner/DC GL was not supposed to suck.The story as it has been doing rounds is yes very much listed from the EXTREMIS story line and adapted cleverly but not completely. For the cast part the one person we have to commend is Sir Ben Kingsley, but please don't compare his part with Heath ledger in dark knight. Sir Ben is definitely excellent with the way mandarin had to be projected and it was a very clever choice in casting.God knows whats with the negative hype surrounding Gwyneth Paltrow guess it has to be for the marketing of the movie. Any way the rest of the cast have done their parts well and Rebecca hall is the weak link though her Maya Hansen was the strong link character in comics line.As far as Guy Pearce is concerned, damn he will always be the gem in whatever role is given to him . Other than some few twists and bloopers the movie has been delivered in aces.PS: Don't watch the movie in 3D instead watch it on IMAX screens as i am typing this review with a head ache. any way its up to you.By the the question i asked in the beginning there's no iconic dialogue instead the statement from the second movie once gain lingers in this one.I have successfully privatized world peace. But did he make the statement including / excluding himself. we all thought IM 2 answered that but in fact its in this part we understand the statement.Anyway watch the movie on IMAX instead of 3D.

Pacific Rim," Was skeptical, but hey its Giant Mechs vs Giant Monsters. Who wudn't like it.
","OK its definitely been a long time from the time its been released but hey as i have mentioned i was skeptical.So Pacific Rim the biggest ocean belt covering 45% of the world countries with their coastal belts. The first time i got fascinated with these Giant Mechs was from the 1980s cartoon ROBOTECH - and the way it was interpreted, man i have to say i dint know there were other earlier cartoons and anime like the Voltron (series) or the very first GUNDAM series.I have been a fan of Guillermo Del Toro's work for a long time and i got to say the way the story has been told there's no way anyone else could have done it. Giant monsters coming from inter-dimensional portals from the center of the earth instead of space and countries coming together to build robots to battle these monsters all seems a bit childish and out of box even under the current circumstances. But all in the hands of an accomplished storyteller who has many other fantasy works under his belt well, this has to be his best work to date. All the actors involved and their character names all inspired from famous anime series have done their part well. Idris Elba from Luther and Charlie Hunnam from Sons of Anarchy were too good in their parts. A special mention of Rinko Kikochi too who was extremely cute for the role.But why isn't the movie excellent well because its THE MOST AWESOME DUMB MOVIE OR THE DUMBEST AWESOME MOVIE ever. I mean all way the story dint have to pan out the way it was where i felt as the hero had a fake accent and Rinko sama with her weird accent. Yeah i know their story was will they, won't they format and dint quite get along. But all the way its movie that brings out our inner childhood dreams of Bot VS Monster saga on the silver screen which we needed and has been brought.Thank you Guillermo because as of now i am waiting for ROBOTECH's turn and Godzilla remake which are along the way. And by the the soundtrack of the movie is simply awesome and the credit has to go to Ramin Djawadi of Prison Break, Game of thrones, and even Iron Man as well. Man if Hans Zimmer isn't going to score for Man of Steel sequel then at least he has to be on board for the soundtrack. Believe me guys i am typing the review listening to this OST.PS: Don't watch the movie in 3D format but go for it on IMAX format if available or at least on bigger giant screens with better sound effects.",9,4,6,15 December 2013
American Hustle," The acting is top notch, its with the pacing i am disappointed.
","Alright i watched the movie in the wee hours of the night along with my cousins and yeah we did expect a bit like end of the movie showdown. Yeah i know i am a fan of David Russel's other movies like 3 kings, The fighter and yeah i did peek through Silver Linings Playbook. Some of the ensemble cast from the SLP are there as well but i will get straight to the point.American Hustle begins with ' Some of this actually happened' stuff, yeah it did, way back in the late 70s. I wasn't born back then but the world was coming out of the Cuban crisis, the oil crisis and even some cities in the US were being developed through lot of outsourced stuff ohh alright this is getting into unnecessary discussion.The real point is about the acting and hell yeah Amy and Jennifer gave their best performances till date and nobody is going to deny that. Nope.Like i said earlier in the summary the pacing was slow as i guess Russel was trying to get the audience familiarized with the characters and the way their lives were being unfolded along the way through continuous voice overs with the 3 lead actors. Christian Bale with his method acting, Bradley cooper his usual self trying to be charismatic as a FBI agent trying to run the show, Jeremy Renner as the Mayor of Camden who is trying to get buyers in developing the city. And one special mention of Robert De Niro, his was a surprise cameo. Okay i don't want to spoil much but way back then the Bureau was trying to curb the corruption with some special sting operations and they did get to arrest some people from the congressional committee and even the mayor as mentioned in the movie as well along the way it unfolds. It might have been one hell of a sting back then and lets hope for the sake of the story that operation did in fact move this slowly as well. But come on seriously some of us will be shifting through our seats and screaming in our heads what the hell is wrong with these guys, nope that was not right we have to say why the hell are we going through this stuff anyway.Now we did get to see a history lesson fictionalized which was represented well not because of the damn story but its convincing actors and for that i will give a rating of 7.That's all guys, which is what i can say, damn i should have gone to Wolf of Wall Street at least.",7,0,1,19 January 2014
Man of Steel," This is to the critics, ' Not the Superman we wanted, but the Man Of Steel we needed'.
","This review is directly aimed at bashing the critics, so here goes everything.Not many people understand that this movie is a bold undertaking in completely revamping the character as per the NEW 52 storyline. yes i am glad the red undie is gone, finally. Phew...The foremost point Superman kills in this movie, and why shouldn't he, the Richard Donner version, with Christopher Reeves was light hearted and was fun with fantasy element. Here i will call it the Snyder Version, not the Nolan version, mind it, was a bold move in fact a very different take on our beloved hero who in fact tries to find his true lineage after years of self doubt. Literally 33 years as per the movie. Anyway in Superman II the version of ZOD by Terence Stamp was cold, calculating and extremely intelligent, but here Micheal Shannon is Military bred, aggressive, through & through insanely logical for accomplishing the greater good for his home world. So when you are faced with a difficult opponent who can adapt a lot faster to the environment than you and hell bent in destroying everything you stand by going against it what would be the best way to stop him, flying away is not an option or even beating him out is not either, so he kills. But that will define the moment for the coming sequels for making our hero the one we have always cared for.The Sci-fi plot could have been handled with a 10% more care but hey this is a movie and we need to understand, they are redoing all our heroes as per the more grounded rules now a days and there's also a time limit and only so much can be shown on screen.I am glad i could understand from this movie's POV why he never killed later on but even comic versions as well show Superman has killed ZOD so i am not surprised right now.Now i would like to get the characters Honestly i liked Superman Returns with both Singer and Routh in it wished more could work out.But hell anyway this movie works for me just enough to crave for more.Henry Cavill has portrayed both the CK and Supes part well. I appreciate the effort. His voice too could be used for the DCAU versions.Amy Adams is cute, and subtle for the role of LL.But the real stand come from the senior actors.Both the Robin Hoods, Kevin Costner and Russel Crowe have given their best roles in modifying the role of Clark Kent / Kal-el.But its Antje Traue, Faora who steals the lime light from both Cavill and Micheal as the apt follower of ZOD, and i have to say she would have made a very good Lois lane as well.Dianne Lane and Ayelet Zurer both have done a commendable job.Snyder and Goyer please take a bow for your interpretation of our hero and continue with the good work.",9,0,1,20 June 2013
