Casablanca," Not bad by any means, but still the most overrated film of all time
","This is a good movie, maybe even a great one. It is most definitely not one of the best movies ever made. What it is is a perfect example of a specific style of 'Old Hollywood' filmmaking, maybe the best example there is. But if that style was the best way to make films, they would still make films like that.That's not to say I don't like this movie. I even understand why some people love it. It's a pleasant romantic film with some very iconic moments. For me, The Marseillaise scene is very powerful. Despite all that, this film fails to be a great piece of art in the way more challenging films like Citizen Kane, Persona, and The Passion of Joan of Arc are.And that's because, despite the strong story of the film, it has very little to say. Curtiz is not interested in raising any questions, but simply telling his story and drumming up support for the war. He's also not a great director, as the movie's cinematic style is overly theatrical, without any attempt to use cinematography and editing to tell the story. The acting is (as usual) is great from Bergman, and rather cheesy from Bogart.This movie is a classic, there's no denying that. But it's a classic because it's simply a good example of a style that is typical of the time. What is typical is almost never important. If the movie is worth watching it's only because of the place it holds in American culture. It's place in the overall history and development of film is almost nonexistent.",Null,7,16,12 August 2016
Donnie Darko," Tries to combine two very different types of films without much success
","The biggest problem with this movie is it can't decide whether it wants to be some Lynchian sci- fi mind bender or a high school black comedy/suburban satire along the lines of Heathers or American Beauty. There are individual scenes that might work well in each, but as a whole it comes off as jumbled and tonally inconsistent. Richard Kelly seems to think there's significant thematic crossover here, but it's unclear what he thinks these themes even are. The famous ending is actually pretty easy to figure out, but the movie insists on throwing in some poorly defined and meaningless rules to appear more complex than it actually is, and then ruining this effect by literally spelling them out on the screen. It clarifies nothing, just demonstrates that the filmmakers are terrified of people not getting that there's supposed to be symbolism and time travel elements. The use of pop music to force the mood at times is distracting and dates the movie.This movie is a sort of half-hearted attempt at Maze cinema (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Mulholland Drive, or Last Year at Marienbad for example) that tries to awkwardly marry certain elements of these quite challenging films with aesthetics and archetypes we're more used to. If it was a little more straightforward it would make a good dark comedy about a mentally ill teen. If it were a lot less conventional in its choices it might make a good art film. Instead the result is entertaining and a bit fun to ponder but ends up feeling a little pretentious. A teen movie, a political satire, and a pseudo-philosophical time travel enigma are all rolled up into this promising, puzzling, but ultimately uncertain movie.",6,1,1,9 March 2017
