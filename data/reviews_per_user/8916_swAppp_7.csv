Frost_Nixon," Review on Frost/Nixon
","Why this movie is worth watching? A few reasons can attract a person like me. a) it is up for award consideration. b) Has a director of brilliant movies such as beautiful mind or Cinderella. c) is depicting a real person. Apart from attracting a person to watch a movie, there is a question: how to keep him interested in watching movie through. Frost/Nixon has an amazing duel between to giants - politic giant and performing giant. Those together impress the audience. Movie is involving, loud, and thoughtful. The guy who played Nixon and the dude who was Frost did brilliant job. No complains on them. Sweating looked real, movie seems real and good. Maybe it will grab an award or two of some sort this or next year.",Null,2,8,9 December 2008
3:10 to Yuma," This town's gonna burn!
","First off all, this was amazing. Director James Mangold surprised me once with powerful, dramatic and Oscar winning 'Walk the Line'. I thought that it was all that i can expect from this genius. Lucky, this director has guts, as sure do the cast.Western, faked action in the past created in our days. What do we know about simulating a western? Turns out we have everything. Every detail in its place, every man with his gun, everyone giving away even their family in order to get money. Stubborn farmers, thieves who can shoot you from a mile... Surely, this movie has everything that is needed for our excitement, not forgetting good guys, bad guys and good guys that turn out to be cowards.3:10 to Yuma flushed me few centuries back from the very beginning, and merely after the end, more than anything, i wanted to be flushed again. Actors did a lot of work. Cristian Bale continued his recent success with another powerful and Oscar-worthy acting, Russell Crowe made it clear that he has his own reasons with a fabulous performance as Ben Wade...I think this movie would be one of the years best even with only those two stars in the whole movie, but others really didn't damage the view. Diferently, i would gladly give out Oscar trophy for best supporting actor - Ben Foster in role of Charlie Prince. He is describable only by one world - amazing.Concluding, 3:10 To Yuma IS REALLY A MUST MUST MUST-SEE movie. Amazing, superb, excellent.",Null,1,2,21 October 2007
The Young Victoria," Queen of your dreams
","I came across 'The Young Victoria' quite by accident, so I was not expecting a lot before watching the film. I had a faint idea that storyline was about kings and queens, and cast included the beloved Emily Blunt.The story. There is nothing completely different from other monarch's history movies in 'The Young Victoria'. There is nothing less. The experience is like passing along the history line.The Characters. I did enjoy Emily Blunt's role, just as her acting, although I noticed that the change in her looks was too harsh. Bettany acted quite well. However, not all of his motives were clear. The scenery. Every time I watch a British movie, I see lots and lots of marvelous palaces and wonderful gardens. I saw it in this movie to. Nice, delicately presented and sweet. The goal. I hope this film will help us understand more about what queens life looks like, what pressures can people face and how they react. Finally, I hope everyone who comes across 'Young Victoria' will not get disappointed, as there is no need to be.",Null,9,22,22 May 2009
The Great Dictator," Good
","This is the firs movie made by Chaplin that i watched knowing what kind of person Charlie Chaplin was. At least knowing that he was a comedian. Before, I had only watched 'Chaplin' with Richard Dawney Jr., which gave me a good perspective of what I could have expected in here. I got what I wanted. Funny moves, interesting speeches and moving story. The dictator might not be so great, but Chaplin is. The way people acted in this movie - always watching not into the camera, but somewhere above, like farther into the audience - strange, but realistic, too. Moreover, I really enjoyed hat Hungarian song played when Chaplin was a barber, cutting bears. Or the situation when he wanted to cut beard from a girl which does not have beards. Problem of treating freedom as a right and Jews as just another people made this movie interesting. The last speech - weirdly funny.",Null,1,2,7 December 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Movie with no point to exist, exists!!!
","I haven't seen any good movie for over two weeks. So i was glad that i had an opportunity to see something new. Bourne is old story for a lot of you, pupils, but this was my first encounter with Bourne. Here it goes. At the beginning of the movie, i thought - it looks like its another 'Die Hard' style movie, good guys against the bad guys. However, this was something else. In this movie, one guy thinks he is the good guy and fights for the truth. Other side, very serious agency, thinks they are the good guys and that what they are doing is OK for their country. So this movie was somehow special. There were no good guys as everyone is bad or have done something not really good. Also we cant say, that all the guys are bad as some are complaining, how terrible their colleges are. Yes, Bourne would be the bad guy, as he kills everyone in his way, however, he's not a bad guy nor good. He saved the life of the only nice girl in the movie. Concluding this, i only could clap in the end. The Bourne Ultimatum is not an usual action-romance movie, it has tremendous fights, duels and even.. charismatic actors... Go see it in the theater, believe me, its worth it.",Null,0,1,16 August 2007
Ghost Rider," A Devil's bounty hunter? No, Ghost Rider
","First of all, i didn't expect anything from this movie, but i noticed that premiere of this movie will be same as in all world, so i decided to try it and guess what. I liked it. Not the best ever, but one of the best Cage movies so far. Not boring, fast and sparkling - thats what i should say about this movie. Although some part of movie was strange, it all summed up in Ghost Rider. So, this movie was highly over my expectations and highly from lines of it genre. Totally not comedy movie becomes more laughable than most of crappy todays comedies in just 5 minutes? Well, thats really something new. It was really enjoyable that movie was pretty about Rider finding his powers, not like: Boom, hes a ghost rider, 2min after - boom, all enemies are dead. ;]All in all, this movie isn't one of those must-see, but still, worth seeing.",Null,11,23,16 February 2007
Defiance," Jews bring the chill
","I don't trust the history books, as I don't trust the reality of facts in an autobiographical book, maybe even more. So goes with movies. Just a day before watching Defiance, I discussed with a friend about whether Lenin was killed by Stalin or not. It's just a story that you can interpret very widely. Even history books interpret - we can take the creation of city Rome by Romus and Remulus. This movie gave me another of those interpretations - how true is it, I don't know, but the message in the beginning 'A true story' made me watch this while trying to think how it could really have happened.I live not far from the location used in a film. There were nothing but Jews in bigger cities of my country, and now there are barely any left. I believe Defiance gives Jews justice. I understand now, that as any other people, they didn't want to fight, but when angry or furious, they did. They fought they are different, but they certainly weren't. I want to underline that Jews are just as any other people. They do not differ from regular village person more than a black man differs from white. Edward Zwick depicted Jews that want revenge, can unite for better good, but can still be selfish in those beautiful forests.I loved the way film is directed - camera movement, strong personalities, hidden messages, and it was even long! In conclusion, I was startled by the point that Defiance is the first movie I have seen this year, it is informative, intellectual and still differs from other war movies. And we have lots and lots of those.",Null,13,30,1 January 2009
