Requiem for a Dream," Whoa!
","This is most certainly the best movie I have ever seen!! It came over me like rain in the middle of nowhere. I just couldn't move, couldn't think, couldn't do anything during it. The film really possessed me. Very very nice, recommend it to everybody! Thanks...",10,0,0,20 February 2003
