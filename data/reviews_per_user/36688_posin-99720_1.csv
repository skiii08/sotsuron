Come and See," The film is not about War. The story about how internal transforms into infernal.
","The war is background only. About how thin layer of Eurpean civilization fly off and nude a core of each person. External conditions - war, blood, corps -discover core of each own soul. Usually soviet war films are not about war adventures but about mostly shown the similar transformation inside people onder pressure of war conditions.
The film shows as civilized men without of law frames (German soldiers was freed from any legal liability for any crimes on Soviet territory by Hitler's order 14 May 1941) transform not even into animals, but demons. Without a word about the honest soldiers of Wehrmacht, as opposed to the evil SS men. No mercy for children, the elderly, women. This does not apply to human animal roots. These were hellish desires to torture people, a little covered by external manners and uniforms.
The film shows how the inner being of modern capitalism without a legal framework freed the hellish core of 'homo homini lupus est'.",9,2,2,16 February 2020
