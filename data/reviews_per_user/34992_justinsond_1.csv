Marie Antoinette," Different point of view
","I think that this movie was great...we got to see the point of view from Marie Antoinette instead of from another view. Some say this movie makes her look like a hero but I don't see this at all! It follows her point of view from leaving her comfort and almost casual lifestyle as royalty in Austria to the prude and proper royal life in France. She seems to liven up the French royal court and to enjoy life. Yet at the same time while she was enjoying life and being excessive the common people of France were hurting, and with media twists Marie was the one pointed with the blame. Overall a great film for a feel of the late 18th century in France and the culture of the royal family!",9,2,4,20 November 2006
