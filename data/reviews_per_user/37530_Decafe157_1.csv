The Benchwarmers," Very bad movie...
","Knowing that this movie was produced by Adam Sandler's company, I wasn't expecting much in terms of intelligent humor or a logical plot, but this was the first movie that I ever wanted to walk out on. It consisted of gross humor such as farting in people's faces and eating buggers. The jokes were predictable and unfunny. Heder reprises his role as Napoleon Dynamite minus the glasses and hair. I hope he has other acting abilities because his whole routine is getting very stale. There was a guy who gave himself a titty twister, someone in the stands asking for a little person as a pet, a bully coming up with the insult 'Gus Bus', and the so called plot twist of Snieder's character being a former bully was predictable from the start. I saw Deuce Bigalow 2 and thought that Rob Sneider could not be in a worse movie. Well, he managed to prove me wrong. If you want to see one of the worse movies ever made, then go see The Benchwarmers. Otherwise, save your money!",1,17,32,3 July 2006
