Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Where is all the fuss about?
","Okay, okay. I know all you Star Wars-fans out there are really 'in love' with the 'o so great and new Star Wars-movie'. Well let me tell you something. Although I liked the film it wasn't a really good script. I was amazed by the special effects and the way they filmed everything. Even the action-scenes where very good. But the story line hasn't improved. I really don't mind, but I can't believe that so many people voted a ten for this movie. I mean, it wasn't that great! And really, why would you stand in line for tickets a lot of weeks, while the film isn't out yet. Can't you wait or something? Well, anyway, I know I'm just a Dutch girl, but the movie was...eh...not really great, but not really bad.So if you liked the earlier Star Wars-movies you should see this one. Especially the special effects are great!!!!",7,4,6,22 March 2000
Pearl Harbor," An Epic Movie
","This movie was exactly like I expected. OK, it was a bit predictable. And all the historic aspects were known as well. At least, it must have been for all the Americans who have watched it. But the special effects were beautiful and it was really interesting to see everything that happened at Pearl Harbor. In short, it was a really cool movie. Not the best I've seen this year, but certainly a good movie.",8,0,2,13 March 2002
The Sixth Sense," One of the best movies of 1999!
","It was simply one of the best movies I saw this year. It was very scary at first which was really cool. And then the ending, terrific! They couldn't have thought up a better ending. What an idea! Well if you haven't seen it yet you should practically run to the cinema to see it. Have much fun with it!",10,0,0,7 March 2000
