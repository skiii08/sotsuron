The Blair Witch Project," This is the worst horror movie ever made, if not the worst movie ever made period.
","First, as a horror movie fan, I must say that it takes a really, really, really bad horror film for me to hate it. For example, 'The Blair Witch Project': The only good thing about that movie is the acting. The rest of the movie sucks!!!! 'The Blair Witch Project' pulled off something that very few horror movies managed to do: It made me hate it. In a nutshell, three college students do some interviews asking questions about the local legend of the 'Blair Witch'. After that, they drive out to the woods to solve the mystery of the Blair Witch.....and guess what? Not only do they NOT solve the mystery, but nobody survives. What a crappy film. The makers of the movie tried to go for a 'realistic' approach to a horror movie, but in doing so, I swear to god upon everything in the universe, it is the only horror movie that made me bored stiff. Again, I will say that horror movies never do that for me! Just this one! It is a complete and utter waste of time. See this movie just once just to see how bad it really is, to satisfy your curiosity, and then never see it again.",1,2,4,13 November 2005
