Child 44," Tom Rob Smith's novel is adapted fairly well.
","For me I'm afraid it's a case of never watch a film after reading the book. There are so many gaps in the film when compared to the book. It's a very dark and intricate story. It felt like an element was missing, reading the novel you get a true idea how awful life would have been for people living under the Stalin regime, you could almost taste the fear. Had I not read the novel I would have probably scored it higher. Tom Hardy without a doubt was the best element of the film, it's no surprise he's getting the volume of work that he is. His Russian accent was good, better then most of the others, it felt like some were attempting the accent and some couldn't be bothered.",6,3,6,3 October 2015
Aliens," The best sequel, enough said.
","I've enjoyed reading the many reviews of this film, and there is little I can say that hasn't been said already, for me Alien is a 9/10, and Aliens is a 10/10. This film is no near perfection it's unreal. Every single aspect of this film is perfection, the story, acting, characters, scare factor etc, there are no flaws here at all. If you haven't seen it before I implore you to watch it, but be prepared it's a scare fest. This is always the answer to the question when someone asks, can you name a sequel that was better then the original? answer yes this one!! Sheer utter brilliance. The Aliens themselves are shrouded in mystery in this film, so little is known about them, and we leave the film knowing as little, only that they are nasty!",10,2,5,3 October 2015
Macbeth," Fairly watchable interpretation.
","I found it a rather strange choice of material, most people I know are haunted by School lessons, being made to decipher Shakespeare, most often Macbeth. Not a film many would wish to see I would have thought but I went as I like Fassbender, a strong character actor, fantastic as Steve Jobs. As Macbeth he performs well, as do his peers. The problem with this production is it's very much a film you need to be in a particular kind of mood to enjoy. It is particularly dark in tone, the material as we all know is rather bleak. It's the kind of film i'd deem heavy, some of the dialogue at times was a little difficult to pick up. A film I'm sure will be the stuff of nightmares for School children.",5,5,9,28 October 2015
