Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Complaints...
","Star Wars - Episode 1 is by far the Star Wars saga's most boring film. It is more of a child's movie than a 'real' movie like episodes 4-6, and they must have made the pod race just so they could make money on the game. Not to mention Jar-Jar Binks. He is the one destroying the movie completely. OK he could be funny if you saw him in like one scene, but he is always ...argh... throughout the whole movie.. agh.. Still... 'The Phantom menace' is a real Star Wars movie. That is why I give it three out of ten instead of one out of ten.",3,0,1,10 September 2000
