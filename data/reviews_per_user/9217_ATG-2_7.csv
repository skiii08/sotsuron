Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The best Star Wars movie yet!!
",I liked this movie a lot it had a lot of cool si-fi action.  The sound in the movie was really good and the acting was also well done.  I liked the light sabor battle at the end that was the best scene in the whole movie. I think that any one who loves star wars has got to see Episode I NOW!  It is a lot better to see it on the big screen than to see it on home video.  I can not wait on till 2002 when Star Wars Episode II comes out.  I give this movie **** out of ****,10,0,0,29 May 1999
The Mummy," Definitely worth seeing!
",I saw this movie and I liked it.  It was not scary at all but it had a lot of good action in it.  I thought it was like a Star Gate movie.  The only bad part about the movie is that you can tell the mummy is completely computer animated but that is o.k. because the rest of the movie made up for that.  If you see this movie and like it I strongly would urge you to see Army Of Darkness.,10,0,0,17 May 1999
Die Hard," One of the best!
",This movie was so cool I think that it is one of the best action movies of all time.  There was a lot of shooting and stuff in the film but it was really good. I think that everyone should see this movie and if you like it then check out Die Hard II and III I know that you will like those also. I give die hard **** out of *****,10,0,1,23 June 1999
Raging Bull," The best movie of all time. A true masterpiece!
","Raging Bull puts you into Jake LaMotta's world of hopes, desires, and terrible upsession.  Martin Scorsese makes the movie a enjoyable experience that makes you understand what you need in order to get a title shot, keep it, and deal with everything else.  The powerful, memorable piece was a perfect example of true perfection.  The opening scene when it brings you to when he is a older man who gets ready to talk to a crowd about his experiences and ended right before he was going out saying 'I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss.'  Raging Bull is the most commemorating experience in American Film history.  This was an experience which will make you cry and understand that this movie is truly a perfect picture.",1,7,48,1 April 1999
The Matrix," One of the best ever!
",The Matrix was by far one of the best films that I have ever seen!  From the beginning to end I was on the edge of my seat.  It had lots of action in the movie and it was so sci-fi and weird. I loved the camera shots.  I think that every one should see this movie even if you do not like sci-fi movies.  I can not wait till this movie comes out on video so I can buy it. Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne are great!,10,0,0,17 May 1999
Gladiator," The best movie that you will see this spring!!
",I work at the movies so I get to see everything for free so I plan on seeing GLADIATOR at least 3 times I saw it once already and I was swept of my feet. The movie was so well done it was amazing.  From the quick and fast camra shots at the beging of the flim to the great dream scene at the end.  Every one should see this flim but I got to tell you that some parts of this flim are hard to watch do to the blood and gore.,10,0,0,6 May 2000
Goodfellas," One of the best bad boy films ever!
",This film was sad but the acting was really good in it.  I like Taxi Driver better. See that one before you see this but they are both good movies.by ATG-2,5,1,17,31 March 1999
