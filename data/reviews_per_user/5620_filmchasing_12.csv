Whip It," The Coming-Of-Age Derby
","This coming-of-age film rocks. And how cool is that music?! You've got your attention-grabbing ingredients: good script, good actors, and an all-around fun atmosphere that make up for the occasional odd framing choice.Along with a commendable performance by musician Landon Pigg, the original script doesn't fail to inspire with a character like Bliss (Ellen Page), who is chalked full of spirit and drive, regardless of what people think.A better choice than watching anything on ABC Family. Check this one out.7.3/10",7,1,5,29 June 2010
127 Hours," 127 Hours
","A mountain climber takes a day trip through canyons & finds himself stuck.A harrowing struggle of man vs. nature. James gives a brave, believable performance, & you're with Aron every step of his struggle. In addition, you get glimpses of his past and the building blocks that have made him who he is as a person. Gripping stuff.Fast editing choices that are signature Boyle intersperse with poignant moments beautifully shot.Universal themes on what it means to survive, endure & live.I'll never look at water the same way again.8/10",8,0,2,20 March 2011
In the Name of the Father," Disturbing Truths
","A man and his family are accused of the 1974 Guilford pub bombings.This story is a force to be reckoned with, showcasing the morality of human actions between displays of brutality and tremendous courage.As for cinematography, really excellent gritty quality that lends itself well to the mood.A powerful tale of truth and justice. There are some riveting and intense performances, especially by Daniel Day Lewis. It's impossible not to be rattled after seeing this. It is that strong of a film. I highly recommend this.9/10",9,1,3,20 March 2011
Dark City," Fascinating World of Darkness
","A man wakes to find his memory gone while being hunted by two groups of folks.It's City of Lost Children meets The Matrix meets the Adjustment Bureau. Inspiring set designs & stylized cinematography add to this scifi-mystery set in an ever-changing metropolis.Thrown into an eerie world of darkness & confronted by sinister forces, anything can happen. You're never sure what's really going on until the end. Pretty good effects one can only imagine what they'd look like today.A visual & cinematic treat heightened by a great score. Bizarre and absolutely fantastic!",9,0,2,1 May 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Scott Pilgrim Is Amazing
","Recap: Scott Pilgrim must defeat 7 evil-exes in order to win the girl of his dreams.Wow. Double-wow. This film packs so many punches into one movie that I'm still reeling from it. The style alone works ridiculously well. Refreshingly fun with killer script & characters (literally). Loved every minute of it.Video game lovers will rejoice, as will those who enjoy being really, really entertained. Great visuals, effects, music.Easily one of my favorite films this year.9/10",9,18,44,21 August 2010
Mulholland Drive," A Warped Little/Big Surprise.......
","What a film, what a strange, bizarrely awesome film. I agree with many other reviewers who have already said what I wanted to say.Great direction, cinematography, and even the acting, which at times doesn't make sense, suddenly does when you get to the end. The strange-ness of the film near the end reminds me a lot of the theatrical which just adds to my admiration, because there's just so much potential to be explored by combining those styles. I felt there was a certain energy that I've seen on the stage being transferred into the film's conclusion which is just original and refreshing to watch.To me, this film is a character tragedy involving an actress full of dreams and illusions, and the monster that is Hollywood and its surrounding bubbles of people. Disturbing, fascinating, and utterly absorbing, I loved being sucked into this movie filled with seemingly out-of-nowhere characters and incidents, because it all tied up at the end and definitely left me with a little of the creepy crawlies -- nice, unexpected surprise.I love when movies break out of the norm that is Hollywood cinema. I loved watching how David Lynch thwarted our expectations at every turn, and how he makes you want to re-watch this because there's just SO MUCH TO DISCOVER.Great film.",9,2,3,23 March 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," Big Brother is Watching
","Story of a young politician who decides to take fate into his own hands after meeting a ballet dancer.Emily Blunt & Matt Damon are electric as they fight for what they want. They each reflect something about society and how our relationships impact our lives.With danger from a supernatural force, the tension builds to create something entertaining & meaningful. Some really original prop ideas, settings, and characters, even though they could have developed it more.Although it's a little rough around the edges, it's definitely worth watching for the more unique aspects.7.7/10",8,1,2,20 March 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," Simply Amazing
","If you haven't seen HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON yet, you're missing out.Tight script, great actors with good timing, really interesting animation and cool characters (OK how cute was that night-terror dragon?). Hiccup is your average misfit that takes on the adventure of a lifetime. Lovable, dorky, and a good heart, you're rooting for him every step of the way.There's action, adventure, battles with some really crazy dragons, comedy, and lots of amazing things that you wouldn't expect from the trailer. Watch it.Possibly the best film of 2010 so far.10/10",10,1,2,29 June 2010
12 Years a Slave," A Story of Survival
","A free man is captured and sold into slavery. This film was based on a true story, so for folks like Solomon Northup, there's no escaping the memory of torment from his oppressors. All he has is hope and the will to survive, and that speaks volumes even in today's world.Brutal to watch (which is the point) but much more difficult to live out (the actors- I commend you). Steve McQueen takes you on a roller-coaster of emotions. From anger to rage to bewilderment to despair to understanding to hope. There's no sugar-coating any of it; what you get is raw, unfiltered storytelling here, and the actors grab onto it with courage and dive off the deep- end, pulling you along with it. This film will rip your heart out and hopefully stitch it back together again.8/10",8,0,2,16 February 2014
Rango," Not bad I suppose.....
","A chameleon with an identity crisis stumbles upon a desert town with a water crisis.As an animation it's pretty good. Solid story, sympathetic & fun main character, but everything else is a little too generic for my tastes. You've seen the same cowboy story a hundred times.On the plus side, there are some stunning shots of the sky, along with a few adventurous scenes with lots of devilish characters.If you like films of the animal persuasion, you'll probably dig this. Good morals at the end.7.4/10",7,1,3,20 March 2011
Amélie," One of my favorite films!
","A young woman sets out to better the lives of others & finds romance along the way.This film started my love affair with cinematography with all of its gorgeous tones & unique framing style filled with such charming, expressive and one-of-a-kind characters! There's such an energy to it!Everything about this is just good. Direction, writing, acting, set designs, you name it. Jean Pierre Jeunet and his endless well of creativity has created a masterpiece of top-notch filmmaking! 10/10",10,2,6,20 March 2011
The Fighter," And a one, two, punch
","Tale of a boxer against all odds.Raw, gritty, intense. Everything you'd expect from a boxing movie. Christian Bale really steals the show.Micky Ward's sisters add a great, humorous balance to this crazy mix of characters.With the hand-held camera & old-school effects, there's nothing picturesque about this.Only thing that bothered me was that it felt like a scene was missing at the end.Altogether? Spirited & inspiring.8/10",8,0,0,20 March 2011
