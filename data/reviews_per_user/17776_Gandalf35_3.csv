United 93," What lieth beneath
","United 93 was well done in some respects but that is only skin deep. There were subtle but disturbing things about how the movie presented things. To begin with, they really presented the terrorists in a sympathetic light. The lead terrorist is a reluctant participant who even takes the time to call home and say 'I love you' before attempting to murder hundreds of people. The facts on these terrorists do not support this in the least. They trained for months if not years. They were fanatics who willingly signed up for this. Their views told them that they were about to enter paradise (40 virgins included) and that they would even be able to have 20 select friends and family join them in the afterlife (sounds like a sweet deal to me). Video footage of Mohammed Atta (the head terrorist) shows him smiling at the prospect in his preparations to carry this out.United 93 also EMPHASIZED problems in how the government responded to this baffling and unthinkable attack. How many times did they show a lack of resources or a lack of communication (over and over). From the standpoint of 20/20 hindsight it is easy to criticize. The movie is harsh in its portrayal and hardly cuts people any slack. What president has EVER ordered a hijacked plane to be shot down? Blame blame blame the administration but portray the terrorists as sincere, devout Muslims who really only want to be true to their convictions and they still have some humanity about them. Show the terrorists briefly attack passengers with minimal blood but then show rebellious passengers bludgeon a terrorist to death graphically as they pounce on him like a pack of wolves. Show passengers pray Our Father as they face death but show the Muslims praying to their god at the same time as though there is some kind of perverse parallel or equivalence.United 93 clearly has an agenda behind it. Even the DVD documentary is telling when it portrays a woman expressing her anger, not at the terrorists of course, but at the administration for what it failed to do in this historic and unprecedented attack on American soil. I think it is sad that the makers of this film used this tragedy to foist propaganda. It is hardly faithful to what happened that day and any positives are eclipsed by the negatives of Hollywood orthodoxy.",2,2,12,11 October 2006
Cold Mountain," Civil War accurately portrayed?
",This movie was filled with tiresome clich√©s dressed up as an historical portrait of the South.To begin with it buys into the fallacy that the Civil War was primarily about slavery when it only became about that in the history books after the Union forces won. Some glaring historical facts support this such as the fact that Lincoln did not 'free the slaves' until at least two years into the war and then he only freed the Southern slaves. Ulysses Grant - general of the Union forces - had slaves during the war whereas General Lee did not.In the South blacks fought alongside the whites. Whereas in the North they had their own segregated regiment - 'eulogized' in the movie 'Glory' with Matthew Broderick - as the union men did not want to fight alongside 'darkies'.The people of New York rioted and killed blacks after Lincoln's emancipation decree - somewhat accurately portrayed in the movie 'The Gangs of New York.'All these facts fly in the face of the 'death to all abolitionists' line in the movie Cold Mountain - when in fact there were many abolitionist organizations in the South. These facts fly in the face of the seeming ignorance people in the movie have as to the battle cry of the South when one says 'last time I checked the south was a direction'. As if someone in the South - who voted overwhelmingly for succession - would not understand that the war was about the independence of states and their rights. They fought against the tyranny of the North to force their will on other states simply because they had more guns. Like most I am glad slavery died but let us not pretend that this was nobly achieved as the central cause behind the American Civil War - or more accurately The War of Northern Aggression.,1,6,14,28 August 2004
Avatar," Great SPFX but more than that needed for a great movie
","I was greatly disappointed by the content of this film. I grant that the visual effects were excellent but not as amazing as many make it sound. The plot was hackneyed and entirely predictable. I found myself repeatedly looking at my watch in the last hour and that is supposed to be the climax of the movie!This movie preaches a message of environmentalism and animistic spirituality which is not even thinly veiled. After a while, it becomes tiresome and insulting to the audience. I also found the acting too facile and often cartoonish. Supervillainous bad guys who just love profit, evil, death and destruction. Yes, there is corporate greed in the world. The irony here is that Cameron spent hundreds of millions on this for - you guessed it - profit!! I think most of the favourable reviews are coming from those who are taken with the effects but it takes more than that to make a great movie - especially one over 2 hours long. I do not think it was time or money well spent.",1,14,38,1 January 2010
