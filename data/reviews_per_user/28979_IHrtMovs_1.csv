The Blair Witch Project," slow, way over-hyped and about as scary as someone saying 'boo'
","I had such great expectations for this movie. 'The scariest movie since _The Exorcist_' and others really got me anxious to see it. I was even scared to take my wife since she's pregnant right now (I didn't want to frighten the baby).  Needless to say, we were underwhelmed. The movie was basically one hour and 29 minutes of three GenXers shouting obscenities at each other while growing increasingly irritated with each other. The final minute was less scary than a campfire ghost story. It's quite unfortunate that in this era of mass-marketing, this movie got so much press (read hype) and ended up being so inadequate. Don't believe what you hear, and don't waste your time/money on this movie.",2,0,2,2 August 1999
