","Shane Black's hilarious comic book movie spoof!
Ostensibly a Dizzee franchise sequel, the latest entry in megalomaniac capitalist Tony Stark's cybernetic journal is nothing more than a parody of what has come before, a special effects-stuffed turkey whose stale, cold leftovers would not even satisfy a porky Comic Con fan boy. The cowards at Marvel, afraid to unleash a truly righteous villain against Stark's falsely patriotic robot alter ego, dump the bin Laden-like Mandarin character halfway through this loud, prolonged video game masquerading as cinema in favor of a fey, bare-chested Richard Branson knockoff intent on destroying the world and bedding Gwyneth Paltrow, or vice-versa.The Mandarin is a phony, as fake as RDJ's waxen-faced performance, with the early scenes of revolutionary fervor and violent reaction to continued colonial oppression merely feints in a convoluted plot to - well, to get us to the end of the hopelessly overlong CGI spectacle. Capitalism rules the narrative, as it does the real world, so a tween boy's happiness spelled out in toys bought with Stark blood money is as close to a cheerful ending as this shameful cartoon can get. 
Shane Black, who promised us his last action hero a couple of decades ago, is resurrected from Hollywood no man's land to fumble his way through the pixelated panels of this comic book disaster, tying it all together in a pretty digital package with much explosion and mayhem, his 1980's modus operandi. That there is 'no there there' is as much trouble to Marvel and Black as their frightened western consumer's approach to eliminating an actual antagonist. 
Tony Stark is, and always has been, a rat of an arms dealer turned savior of the Armor-ican way. This is no more evident in the fact that he allows his hot girlfriend to be turned into a genetically altered monster, then casually 'saves her life' off screen, while in the coda he gets his heart repaired by the best surgeon money can buy: himself. This is a movie filled with such offhand adolescent irrelevancies. Adults could not care a whit about any of it.If the bottom-line overlords at Dizzy had allowed it, Iron Man should have gone metal boot to combat boot with the 'terrorist' Mandarin, and then we'd see the real fallout of Stark's first insidious armorer's holiday to the Middle East (can you say Jericho missile, anyone). As Gandalf might say, 'dealing out death and judgment' is not so easy. It certainly shouldn't be left to some smartass arms company CEO.Like the faux patriotism and plastic industrial America the movie's makers obviously worship, the CGI-blasted mayhem of the movie's climax is nothing but fake sighs and moans. All that matters is Stark gets his mojo back - and never has to face off against displaced people's anger. The Mandarin might be a 'terrorist,' but as depicted in the first half of the movie he is certainly righteously angry - and very funny. Stark, Dizzee, Marvel and all corporate goons deserve retribution at the hands of the people's chaos, but instead they sit around the board table chuckling at this prolonged SNL spoof they have concocted for the fan boys, and the millions r(e)aped in profits as yet another company boss wins the day.",1,1,3,10 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi Deserves to Die
","Star Wars - the Last Jedi is one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. It is terrible. The acting, the directing, and of course the insipid screenplay, all sink to rock bottom, even for a bloated Hollywood blockbuster. As a published film critic with many years experience, I have seldom been more angry at a Hollywood studio for producing such a tiresome, confusing and indeed boring mess. Let's be straightforward: I squirmed through the entire two and a half hours of anyone's waste of time and money, from the grammatically-challenged opening crawl to the ridiculous (and mindlessly telegraphed) anti-climax. Watching this movie was worse than having teeth pulled, it was the long, gut-wrenching and bloody agony of recovery afterwards. Above all, this Disney-produced mess was a cinematic embarrassment. At least with the absurd Marvel movies we have costumed heroes to root for, and our own world to fret about. Who could care less about the anonymous locations and bland characters of this latest assembly-line installment of the redoubtable Lucasfilm franchise? George Lucas once stated the Star Wars movies were made for kids. Watching The Last Jedi as an adult is a stupefying experience, leaving one wondering if any adult had anything to do with its writing or direction. Indeed, the movie feels as if a sugar-hyped horde of grade schoolers mismanaged the entire enterprise. A film criticism usually begins with generalities of story and character and then moves on to critique specific aspects of the production, picking out special moments and positive components while throwing in a few negative zingers to entertain the reader. The Last Jedi is so completely bad I cannot comment on a single good scene. I cannot think of one. Not one. What else can I say? I suppose the visual effects were effectively 'awesome,' but in a cinematic universe filled with black holes of plot, character and storytelling there can be no purchase. I was adrift watching this disaster - as any mature adult should be - so perhaps the only compliment I can pay to the production is 'better luck next time.' The problem with that is Jedi follows on the heels of the clichéd A New Hope remake The Force Awakens, which at least introduced new characters and planetscapes. The Last Jedi is so bereft of original thought and design, it makes The Force Awakens look like a brilliant new concept by comparison.
Still, as critic, I have a job to do -
Star Wars - The Last JediTEN WORST CINEMATIC MOMENTS10) The Korean space plumber kisses Finn. WTF???
9) Vice-Admiral Dern suddenly becomes a hero. Wasn't she supposed to be a villain? Or at least a traitor?
8) The strange little bartender from TFA makes a sad, confused, animated cameo. Again, WTF??
7) The opening crawl. I mean, really, how much did they spend on this disaster, a quarter of a billion dollars, and they couldn't hire a high school English teacher to check the language and punctuation?
6) The telegraphed meaning of the 'bloody' footwork on the red salt planet. So we can figure out Luke is not really there. A perfect example of the movie's messy confusion.
5) All those amazing dialogue rip offs from other Star Wars flicks. Kylo/Ben: 'Join me and we'll bring order to the universe.' Seriously? Bring order to your haircut, Driver.
4) Speaking of Ben/Kylo - Adam Driver is astonishingly bad in this movie. As if Francis Coppolla directed him from a trailer next door. Cinema fans know this reference.
3) The bad acting overall. At least Daisy gives it her best. Everyone else phones it in (yes, you, Benecio) or seems to have been hired right off of Hollywood Boulevard. More evidence of an absentee director. 
2) The comic relief moments that were only painful. My favorite is when the Yoda ghost chides Luke for not having really read the Jedi text. A work sacred to acolytes that is actually unreadable? Sounds like Mein Kampf.
1) I could put the anti-climactic ending here, the rip off - er, reference to - The Empire Strikes Back, with the rebels in disarray and a black-clad evil avenger on their trail, but why ignore the best of the worst? The whole casino sequence! A hapless, CGI-stuffed 'reference' to a James Bond movie, with gambling and shooting and car chases and 'SPLOSIONS - with a few alien critters thrown in for (bad) measure. So stunningly unnecessary it boggles the mind. All for a Benecio cameo.Okay, we had our fun. Now let us put blame where blame is due. They all deserve it.Kathleen Kennedy is a corporate suit with decades of producing clichéd rip-offs of better works from the past, who could care less about storytelling and character craft. Her concern is the bottom line. Period. Reducing a beloved film series to an assembly line process, and a greedy accountant's wet dream, seems to be her entire goal. Running former series characters and storylines through a crass corporate machine, allowing broken cogs and cracked wheels to work them over, is no problem for such a suit. Congratulations, Kathy, you got a Yugo. As for the man credited with 'directing' this dreadful mess, his name deserves no mention, neither praise or contempt will he receive from me for a complete absence from this production (and the fact anyone would allow such an talentless amateur to 'create' more series movies only proves Hollywood to be the artistic hell with which most of us are very familiar). Let us focus our blame on J. J. Abrams. Why? He produced the insipid faux SF TV series Lost, where a muddled mess of storyline was legendary. He ruined Star Trek with two blatantly unimaginative TV movie-style rip offs of third tier SF genre junk. His complete lack of creativity is self-evident in everything he does. The Force Awakens was a blatant remake of A New Hope, and he did not care. Perhaps he's a devil, ruining franchise after franchise, stacking up piles of shekels as he goes. Just have him move on to the Marvel universe and get it over with for goodness sakes. Perhaps he can have Robert Downey Jr. play Sherlock Holmes as Iron Man, a steampunk kind of thing. I'm sure the pork-bellied Comic Con fanboys would eat it up.Lastly, there's Disney. This big business behemoth inches forward through profitability by consuming other companies and better artists ideas. Without Grimm's fairy tales they would have been out of business way back with Steamboat Willie. Instead, they stagger onwards, spending billions acquiring Marvel and Lucasfilm, merging it all into a gargantuan postmodern corporate octopus with its slimy, Lovecraftian tentacles penetrating all of mass media. Their only concern is crass corporate survival, so they can continue to regurgitate (ie remake/reboot/re-'imagine') the same stories and movies ad infinitum ad nauseum. Selling tickets is nothing compared to hawking plastic trinkets in warehouse stores. Disney extracts their consumer 'entertainment tax' and the willing masses have no problem capitulating. Selling McDonald's happy meals is the end all of this entire cinematic enterprise. Finally, how about the fans? Many hated this movie and deservedly so, but mostly because of the way the studio suits treated the Luke Skywalker character. His story arc finished with Jedi. That was thirty-five years ago! I am quite over his character. Folks, you get the movies you deserve. You continue to pay for stinky fish, you keep getting stinky fish. It's that simple. Let's face it, most Star Wars fans don't know (or don't care) that George Lucas ripped off countless other, better fantasy and science fiction for A New Hope (which I will always refer to as Star Wars). Has any of you fanboys/girls actually seen Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress? Cinema is dead. The digital age (among other worse things, like crass mass media corporatism) killed it. As long as studio bosses and their empty suit minions greenlight assembly-line superhero movies, and the fans pay for it, nothing will change. When a movie as supremely awful as The Last Jedi makes bank, the bankers smile - and cinema never rises from the dead. Long live cinema.",1,9,14,10 July 2018
