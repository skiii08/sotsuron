Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good movie.
","The phantom menace was a good sci-fi action movie. The acting was not to bad, but please don't tell me that the acting in the first trilogy was any better. The acting was awful in star wars, but did get better in Empire and Jedi. For me people seem to have forgotten to just sit down and enjoy a movie like the phantom menace. It was not meant to be the greatest movie of all time, it was just done so that people could have a good time for a few hours and bring them in another world.As far as Jar-Jar Bink is concerned, he was less anoying than those little fur balls in Return of the jedi. The special FX were really incredible, way better than in the matrix even if it had awsome FX in that movie too, and the light saber duel at the end showed us just how lame the other duel were in the first trilogy when we look back on them today. The music was good like always, but would've preffered something better for the pod race. After all, what made the star wars movie so incredible was in part because of the music.Also I would have preffered that Anakin Skywalker would have shown a little bit of anger in him, just to remember us that he is to become Darth Vader one day. He looked to cute and innocent.So in general it was a fun movie to watch, way better than most summer movies but not the best of the serie. So far Empire is the best and one of the greatest movie ever....",8,0,0,27 March 2000
X-Men," X-Men
","X-men is a great action movie. It is an action movie based on comic book heros. And finally a good comic book heroes movie adaption. The best since batman returns. They gave the fan of the comics what they wanted to see.First of all, Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. He steals the show. He could not have been better casted. The rest of the cast is pretty good also. Except maybe for Halle Berry. Her accent is pretty lame. At least she looked perfect for the role.The action was well executed. Overall it was a fast paced movie. The jokes in the movie were not forced. They belonged in the situation. They were not placed in there just so there was jokes. There was not crappy things like the bat express card or anything like that.This movie is the foundation for a few sequels I think. If so, they need to continue to orient it for an adult audience. If they do what they did with Batman then they will kill it.",Null,0,0,14 July 2000
