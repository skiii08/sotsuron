Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why Put This Segment Down ?
","I'm going to make this quick and easy.  Cause I know how much people hate long reviews... George Lucas wrote a story back in the 70's.  He thought it was pretty good and wanted to make a Motion Picture out of it.  But as he was writing the script, he noticed that it was WAY too long.  So he divided it into three segments that we now know as... The STAR WARS Trilogy !!! Now, we all realized that it started with the 4th Segment and continued all the way through the 6th and Final Segment.  Well, now the 1st Segment has been written and released and so many people have been trashing it !!! Why ?  It is just another Segment of a HUGE Story.  Why Put This Segment Down ?  People are saying 'It wasn't as good as the other 3' or 'The Storyline sucked' or EVEN 'George Lucas did not have the Force when he wrote this'. Well, all the dumb asses who said that crap are obviously not big fans, because if they were, they'd realize that the storyline was indeed RIGHT ON !  We finally get to see how it all began. My Point... You can't look at this movie as a single movie.  But as the first segment of a story that we have all come to love.  I give this movie a 10 !!!  --Ross",Null,0,0,25 May 1999
American Pie," This is real life, my friend.
","Most movies that I see have the typical 'Guy meets girl, they fall in love, and they 'do it'. Perfect as can be.' But this movie ?... This is real life, my friend. One of the funniest scenes is when one of the guys attempts to make out with a woman but... fails. This movie is hilarious. It also shows that there are some guys out there who just... don't have the guts for it yet. Anyway, I loved this movie not because of the huge amount of comedy, but because it shows a story of four guys striving to get laid, which actually happens in everyday life. I give this movie a 10 !!! --Ross Edward Rogers",Null,0,0,11 July 1999
A Night at the Roxbury," Another SNL Hit !!!
","I've been a fan of these guys ever since the FIRST sketch with them aired. I always Prayed that they would come out with their very own movie, and then one day... THEY DID !!! I was so overjoyed, and got tickets for opening night. Well, let me say, I think they did a GREAT job in turning all those 3-4 minutes sketches into an 80 minute movie. I was reading some of the previous reviews, and I couldn't believe it when I read, 'It wasn't funny'. Well, maybe it wasn't in that person's point of view, but let me ask this person... Is that the only reason why you went to see it ? Because you thought it was funny ? Well, in my opinion, that was a mistake. I know it wasn't entirely his fault. I mean, the previews made it look funnier than it actually was. My advice, don't just rent this movie because you heard it was funny. It wasn't just a comical movie. It had action, tragedy, and romance too. My Point... Some people saw this movie as a 'Tasteless, Not-Funny Movie'. But me ? I saw it as a story about two guys who had a dream, and pursued to make that dream come true. I give this movie as a 10 !!!",10,2,2,25 May 1999
