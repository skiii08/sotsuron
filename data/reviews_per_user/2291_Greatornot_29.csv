The Hangover," It Worked
","This movie has been done to death. Bachelor Party, Bachelor Party In Vegas, The Groomsmen etc. etc. etc. You know what , this film worked. It did not pretend to be a deep movie with a script you had to graduate from an Ivy League School to understand. This was just a silly movie, with silly antics and funny gags and predicaments. There was a lot of originality in this film. It was hilariously funny from start to finish. Fine acting and even finer screenplay. One lost groom with his 3 knucklehead friends trying to piece together what happened. This film was one of the funniest films of all time and well worth anyones time. Somehow Mike Tyson was worked into this film and even his couple of scenes were outstanding. Some supporting characters along the way, most notably sexy Heather Graham and an even funnier Chinese gentleman that stole a scene or 2. The hangover from this one will be most pleasant.",9,1,2,28 February 2010
United 93," Disaster
","Absolutely horrible . I am glad I did not pay for this piece of c***. The acting , accept for David Rasche , who played the passenger with flying experience, was horrible, Incidentally , he was the only actor I have even heard of . The camera shook more than an earthquake. It was like this was made from novices. Boring tech stuff intertwined throughout the movie that basically told us nothing . Those added personal touches on those cells being passed around . Give me a break . I heard I LOVE YOU more in this movie than in a Meg Ryan romantic comedy. Absolutely ridiculous. I could have bought a store full of hallmarks. I agree with some of the other people that this may have been propaganda . I would have to say this movie is another disaster that came from 9-11 albeit belated a half decade.",1,9,26,16 April 2007
The Notebook," Pretty good but not earth shattering
","I enjoyed this film but certainly it was not magnificent. The film was for the most part a basic love story. Wonderful acting performances, wonderful vintage feel to the film with costume,settings and general atmosphere. The setting for a good film was ripe. I felt the film did become too predictable and overly sugary. This was clich√© to say the least. The movie got me gripped from the get go, which I suppose is a good thing. The film just seemed too flat at certain junctures.Yes , there were some tearful moments, but there were also moments of yawning. I do believe Noah and Allie truly did have that once in a lifetime connection that culminated in a fine story. I also believe that the writers were too safe with this script. Tastefulness is always fine, but sometimes a film can be too tasteful , and this was the case with this film. Other than some cute wooing antics, that boys will be boys will succumb , there was not much in the way of risk. This film was too vanilla. In summation, It was a good film, but never reached that higher plateau, which is quite sad. Worth a watch anyway.",7,0,1,14 March 2010
Public Enemies," Expected More From a Depp Film
","OK I admit it. I am tougher on a Johnny Depp movie because I expect Academy award greatness type of film, every time. This movie did entertain. Depp was great as was Christian Bale and Marian Cotillard. No issues with the acting . The movie though , had more of a Spoofy, Film Noire feel to it , rather than tell an in depth story of Johnny Dillinger. I googled Dillinger and I have to admit their was a strong resemblance between Johnny Dillinger and Johnny Depp. Definitely excellent casting. The film though would have been better had it focused on Dillingers complete life story, not just the last year or 2 of his life. Plenty of gratuitous action, but some of it seemed forced and unrealistic. At times this resembled more of a Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger, bad*ss movie. It was based on a true story but became hard to take seriously. It came across to me that the writer of this movie , was more concerned about having nonstop action than relaying a true story. Perhaps this was in the insecurity of the writer himself. I do not know , I am not a psychologist. I do recommend this film. It was a guys film to be sure . My advice.... Do not go in to this thinking its an elite , award film, as I did, because it clearly is not.",7,5,8,13 July 2009
Superbad," So Unfunny
","This was a movie filled with humor that just did not make me laugh. It was a very blase movie. Both Jonah Hill and Michael Cera, have to be 2 of the most overrated actors along with Seth Rogan. This trifecta of actors are ... to put it politely , overly dull, in everything they do. No personality to speak . Christopher Mintz Plase, ironically, the new kid on the block, shined as the ultimate nerd, he was very funny and kept this film from being rated a 1. These gags were all done before. The plot is about as common as the housefly. This was just a film that did not need to be made. I can only hope that this film is the last of these stupid teen wannabe love stories. Comedy is not pretty sometimes , in this case its downright ugly.",3,2,6,12 August 2009
500 Days of Summer," Tried to be Artsy
",The film was enjoyable but it tried too much to be artsy. The biggest problem I had was that the film jumped from one date to another without rhyme or reason. It had that quirky feel and was definitely different than a typical romantic comedy. I still felt the film lacked in consistency . The acting was fine as was the direction. 500 days represents the length of the the relationship. Ultimately what kept this film from being extraordinary was that it tried too hard to be different. I think by jumping around it confused the viewer of the film. It truly was a film worth watching but it could have been much more.,6,0,0,12 September 2011
Spider-Man 3," Too much on the plate
","This film was basically satire. There was no real plot. The nonsensical plot lines; seemed like there were a hundred or so, just made this silly. The way this film seemed to veer, the average joe or criminal can gain super powers just by walking out the door. This was just a very silly film that was just made to bring the spiderman brand some built in bucks. The special effects were fine, thus the 2 stars. This project was an insult to my intelligence and just another disrespectful film fed to the masses with little care for the consumer. The acting was fine , though Spiderman was made into an egotistical , unlikable young man. Kirsten Dunst was whiny most of the film. Save your 2 plus hours .",2,2,4,4 May 2011
No Country for Old Men," GPS system in 1980 ?????????
","I seem to be the only one that noticed this but WTF. The movie was awesome in first half but once I found there was GPS tracking with money , I could not take movie as seriously as when I entered the theater....MOVIE TOOK PLACE IN 1980. I knew who Josh Brolin knew to get the part. The acting was so so, with the exceptions of Javier, and Woody Harrelson. Movie was choppy with onset of Mr. Harrelsons character. It was downhill from that point. To compare this movie to a food, it was swiss cheese because there were lots of holes in it. I hope this movie does NOT clean up at any elite awards celebrations. Incidentally with my 6 rating I was a lot kinder than my girlfriend to the rating of the movie. Its the good thing shes not a computer buff otherwise there would be another 1 rating. In closing, I hope the ending of my rating of this movie was better than the lame ending of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.",6,7,16,23 December 2007
2012," A Disaster of EPIC Proportions
","This movie was too long for starters. There seemed to be way too much emphasis on showing one disaster after another, and showcasing special effects that quite frankly were not that special. The special effects resembled Cecil B DeMilles '10 Commandments', which was done over a half century ago. How sad. The acting was fine but I do not believe that John Cusack was comfortable in his role and for that matter , neither was Danny Glover as the president. They seemed kind of stiff, for lack of a better word. Amanda Peet was better than expected as John Cusacks ex-wife. Oliver Platt as the adviser to the president was OK. The best actor in this film had to be Woody Harrelson. He was terrific as an offbeat DJ ,broadcasting doom from his RV in the midst of Yellowstone. The film revolved around planet alignment causing natural disasters, wreaking havoc on the planet on Dec 21, 2012. The gist of the film was elitism vs. the common man, as far as seeking shelter from the inevitable. I saw this long film in 2 parts ondemand Starz. Took in an hr and half and than later in the day an hr., to finish the film. It gets tedious viewing this in one fell swoop. Just giving fair warning.",3,1,2,18 July 2010
The Mist," Very Uneven Movie
","Although somewhat entertaining , I felt this movie lacked . A military experiment gone awry, but never explained. Did Mr. King have a brain hiccup? The movie based on a short story is something I have seen again and again. This was nothing more than a rehashed mid 60s sci fi movie, only done on a more simple level. It was too long a movie that left out many details . The movie sort of borrowed from 'The Lord of The Flies'. As time progressed you had the stranded in the store taking a side. Go with the evangelical lady , whose dialogue consisted of biblical quotes, or side with the seculars, who just want to escape from this horrible situation. I had no problem with these scenes that portrayed this. Furthermore this film was shockingly familiar to 'Maximum Overdrive', another Stephen King film based on a short story, that was done in the early 90s...Only the villain were machines, not mutants. From an originality standpoint this film lacked bigtime.",4,2,5,23 September 2009
Gran Torino," Entertaining but not ground breaking
","This was a nice little film but it seemed forced to me at times. The ethnic slurs were rampant. OK I get it Clint wanted to make it a point that he was a bad ass Korean war patriot or something like that and he can say what he wanted at anytime. Mr. Eastwood basically played a disgruntled bitter old man wishing for the 50s to come back. He had no passion for his children nor did they for he. He seemingly was a loyal husband now left a widower with his only passion his GRAN TORINO... hence the title. Trouble brews with the Korean family next door and Clint who at first does not like these Koreans, grows to be their friend, savior and mentor. The big bad Clint comes out saves the day over and over with various predicaments leading up to a grand finale with a gang. In summation, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie but thats just it . I do not see it as an award type movie for various reasons. The ethnic jokes and other comedic situations basically told me is the movie did not know where to go, than throw in a wet behind the ears baby faced priest and you have a silly movie. I was entertained so I guess that is the bottom-line in all this . Do not expect a shower of awards from this movie.",7,1,3,11 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," OK But Overrated
","This was just a so-so film with just acceptable acting performances. From what I understand. The people involved with this film, much like the movie 'The Wrestler', another very average film, are genius marketers. In fact this film is involved in a minor e-mail scam to try and influence the Academy on Oscar night. First of all the film , did not have a real plot . Basically the description of the film , in essence , is the film. This movie would probably have been served more justice , if it were done in documentary style;Conversing with real bomb defusers,suicide bombers,locals and military in Iraq. The film was basically one scene after another of removing bombs or some other type of warfare. It was deja vu. In other words, the first scene could very well have been the 8th scene. Here and there , you had the American military socializing and even befriending some of the local Iraqi's. Ironically, I felt those scenes were more enjoyable than the actual 'meat' of the film.... The defusers in action. It is worth a watch , but definitely not an elite movie, despite the kudo's it seems to be receiving.",6,1,5,3 March 2010
Slap Shot," Caricature for sure
","This movie got bad reviews,when it was released ,way back yonder ... yes I know this. The reviewers are simple minded folk. The fact is this movie is a spoof, an enigma , simply, a caricature of hockey and sports and life in general. What a genius flick. I truly mean that . Every scene was thoughtfully done with ironic splendor. From the last scene where being nude is a MOCKERY... LOL, but shedding blood is not. Paul Newman gave a great acting performance . This movie rocks and I especially love the scene where Paul Newmans character parades into the lady owner of the Chiefs and declares they are 'human beings'.... thus human beings that are predatory animals . This movie was simple yet deep. Deep and hilarious, can't beat that. This movie was , in fact, a microcosm of life in general. This showed human emotions beyond the realm of sports and hockey of course. Simply put , a very underrated movie and a classic to be sure. The Hanson Brothers were fantastic and really the wild card of this movie. I felt this movie has stood the test of time and the fact is the critics have been silenced because this movie is a classic and one this guy can watch over and over.",9,3,5,4 July 2008
The Illusionist," Best ending ever
","Very intelligent. This movie is one of those movies you have to pay attention every second and be at optimal alertness.... Which only adds to its intelligence in my opinion. Acting was impeccable. The storyline flowed from start to finish.One minor flaw was the attention getter to start the film. I generally do not like when movies start with a scene that comes up later in the movie. I think it detracts from 'said' movie. That said, I felt movie was a nice surprise and very original. The ending totally blew me away. The magic and trickery in movie only added to it. Refreshing, original plot, great acting, great ending , great scenery, great soundtrack...need not say more- translation= epic film!!!!!",9,1,3,5 January 2008
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Should have been nominated for some Oscars
","This was perhaps the most powerful 'fiction' movie I have seen in a long time. Seriously this movie moved me in ways I expected and not. I am not going to give any spoilers, but I will say that true friendship can develop between anyone regardless of the situation or age. Perhaps our hope in this world lies with the innocence of children, perhaps not. Its OK to dream. The circumstances that arose from this movie , was done meticulously from each person in 'said' situation. The 2 protagonists in this movie were children that were wise beyond their age .... yet they did not know any better. It is a paradox to be sure , but certainly a paradox worth paying to see. Treat yourself to this wonderful movie. I give it a 9 only because it did lose authenticity points for the Brit accents. I am guessing it was low budget. Getting by the unrealistic accents... I truly believe this to be the best movie of 2008. You will not be disappointed.",9,3,7,6 December 2008
The Insider," Whistleblowers Paradise
","I guess the truth shall prevail... eventually. This was an excellent movie . Russel Crowe and Al Pacino were excellent together , especially the scenes where they were interacting. The dialogue was on target and the scenes prolific. You can tell the actors did not miss a beat and were comfortable with each other. Probably, Pacinos last exemplary performance. Wigand was a disgruntled former ex employee of a tobacco giant persuaded by Pacino to tell his story of the industry and its methods of getting people hooked on cigarettes. The details boring and irrelevant for the purpose of this review. Involved were the cigarette companies threats of litigation,violence and blackmail. CBS backed down and than we had a surprise whistleblower in Lowell Bergman- Al Pacino. Christopher Plummer was excellent as well playing '60 Minutes' anchor Mike Wallace. This screenplay hit the mark and highlighted the world of the investigative reporter as well as the News industry in general and the power the large corps have , as far as manipulating the newsworthy issues. Unfortunately, fascism is alive and well in America. Based on a true story, thankfully we still have a couple of men of integrity like Wigand and Bergman. Not exactly Woodward and Bernstein , but this film did have the feel of watergates scandal- 'All The Presidents Men', concocted a couple decades earlier.",9,5,6,28 February 2010
Friends with Benefits," Avoid this film like the plague
","I was actually embarrassed for the headline actors, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. The material was not good nor were the jokes. Justin Timberlake was bad enough to begin, as usual. Mila Kunis is normally better than this. I guess she was playing down to her material and co-star. Either way the acting was horrible as was the plot and the direction. A negative trifecta. If there were any redeeming factors to the film it was the supporting actors. All of which I felt did an excellent job with the material they had to work. Patricia Clarkson, Woody Harrelson, Richard Jenkins and even Jenna Elfman, respectively. The film was predictable which is OK in this genre. Just a sloppy project in every facet. Save your time and bypass this one.",2,17,38,14 August 2011
Taken," Buckle up !
","A fun movie though not to be taken seriously. Sure there are many unrealistic scenes and predicaments and outcomes , but thats what this movie is. It does not pretend to be anything else. After the first 20 minutes or so , the action never lets up. My GF is away and I saw this one by myself. Its a good thing because I do not believe this is a movie that ladies would like. Its a guy movie all the way. Liam Neeson was awesome and never took his foot off the throat. As the movie goes along you will find yourself clapping when another bad guy , gets his fate at the hands of a rightfully maniacal father, a former Secret Agent. I will also say that as silly as this movie is... Maybe people traveling can actually learn something . The naivety of these young ladies is probably more realistic than one might think. There you go, a fun movie and a lesson. You can't beat that for the price of a ticket.",8,0,3,8 February 2009
Crazy Heart," Too contrived but OK
","The acting particularly Jeff Bridges was awesome. Kris Kristofferson, Nick Nolte be damned lol. When you see the film you will know what I am talking about, or if you saw the film, you already understand. Besides Mr. Bridges awesome performance,as a drunk, he sang some CW numbers as well.. Very impressive indeed. Maggie Gylenhaal was fine and material overall was fine. A statuesque journalist with a little boy , inspiring a has been CW star. I particularly liked the screen play with the various settings , sprinkled over the Southwestern states and the rest of the supporting cast, Duvall and Farrel in particular were mighty fine. Now for my problem. As I have said the storyline was good, ranging from losing a boy to Bad Blake trying to reconnect with his 'now', adult son. Some tears , some laughs and holding ones interest. I rambled now heres my BUT. I thought this film was cheapened by having Bad Blake having a sexual relationship with Jean Craddock. At this point the film became a caricature , a clich√© if you will of many other films. This film could have been very special , if the relationship between Jean and Bad was simply one of platonic friends. I do not understand why film makers/book writers feel they have to make every main relationship of a film into a sexual and/or love relationship. This film would have stood on its own without the hanky panky and that is the saddest part of this.",6,1,5,15 February 2010
There Will Be Blood," Can you say AWESOME
","This was a genius film. Much better movie than NO COUNTRY. This should have won best picture. Ironically filmed in same parts of Texas as NO COUNTRY. Daniel Day Lewis gave an awesome performance as Mr. Daniel Plainview.. Early 1900s oilman. His interaction with Paul Dano who played identical twins was spectacular. Basically Mr. Plainview met his match in unassuming but sanctimonious Reverend Eli Sunday. Mr. Plainview did whatever he could , used whomever he could to get ahead. Murder, mayhem, he was a ruthless oilman, a conman to be sure. This movie was a chess match between the 2.Mr. Sunday was not exactly as pure as he portrayed himself to his congregation. One scene in particular that took place in the church is perhaps one of the best scenes I have ever seen. The closest character that came to mind to compare to Mr. Plainview was Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko . Both , ironically , won academy awards , well deserved for their roles. This movie comes to an unexpected last scene that just adds to this fantastic entertainment. Rarely do I see movies that are about 2 and half hrs that you do not want to end. This movie is one of those . You have to be at optimum alertness at all times. This is a pure intellectual film that is well written, well scripted and well acted by all. Do not miss a second of this film that will have one twist after another.",10,2,3,11 September 2009
The Wrestler," Ordinary and Nothing Special
","For all the hype this movie got it was a major letdown. It was an OK movie but seemed there was more in the way of just getting by. Mickey Rourke sounded like he was imitating Rocky . I did not sense any acting identity at all. The wrestling scenes were not realistic even by wrestling standards. It was more shock and awe than anything else. The side characters did not impress me much as well. Marisa Tormei was fine , as she always is . Her acting talents were wasted. I did like the 80s soundtrack and I feel that Bruce Springsteen was robbed by the Academy by not being nominated for his song The Wrestler. Other than the music and some shock scenes that were more inline with a B Horror flick , the movie did not have much. Whoever marketed this movie did a great job, because it seems to be getting tons of kudos. I am still waiting for Mr. Rourkes comeback , because I did not see it in this.",5,3,7,19 February 2009
Hancock," Plot Let Me Down
","Watching this film, I liked the description . It sounded interesting to me and it was on STARZ , so I figured why not. I went in expecting a certain plot , a plot that was going swimmingly for about the first 50 minutes of the film. Absolutely wonderful, I am thinking. Than the film had a certain plot twist , that totally changed the direction of the film. It turned into satire. I liked the actors and thought the special effects were done well, even though I have read other comments,from people that were unimpressed.I just thought this was ashame and really unfair to change the plot of this movie. The chemistry between Bateman and Smith was wonderful,until the unexpected plot twist in a negative direction, derailed this dynamic duo. If they stayed with the original plot, it would have been a winner because it really was creative. See this film if you must but remember you have been warned.",3,1,3,1 June 2009
Defiance," Perfection in every way
","I can not think of one solitary thing to say negatively about this movie.First and foremost the acting was superb. Though this was a true story it had everything going for it. It was a movie of perseverance,revenge, hope, sibling rivalry, survival, battle. You name it this movie had it all. I got a lesson in history and I did not know about the fugitive Russians . This movie more than covered that and with effectiveness revealed a case of true sibling rivalry and without spoiling the movie .... It was a story of family love and common goals and blood being thicker than water. Just a very enjoyable, hopeful, uplifting movie about Jewish fugitives and to a lesser extent Russian fugitives, living a nomadic life , setting kibbutz like camp, at any areas they felt safe , while always looking out for danger.It goes without saying this occurred at the height of the Nazi regime. Its a great discussion movie and as tough as their conditions were it was still better than being in a concentration camp. The relative conformity of the group helped in many ways to overcome even the most dire of circumstances. Just an excellent film and I can not believe it was only nominated for one Oscar .",10,15,34,26 January 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Robert Downey saved this film!
","Lots of action and lots of twists. That said, truth be told Robert Downey saved this film. Without Mr. Downey, this film would have been a 3 , if not a 4. This film was a silly film that went all over the place. Granted there were some twists here and there. For the most part though, this film was aimless. Wonderful costume, wonderful cinematography and lots of action , still without Downey this was a surefire dud. The actors were at best ho hum and the American actors, Downey excluded of course, were horrible when it came to Brit accents.Yes I enjoyed this film . My tip of the hat goes to Robert Downey for bringing this film to an acceptable rating. I believe the other actors in this film, including the overrated Jude Law, should cede their salaries to Mr. Downey.",7,0,5,31 January 2010
Taken 2," Sequel for the sake of a sequel
","First of all, I did give this an average rating for the acting and action. It did not put us to sleep. That said, this film was very ordinary with no twists or anything shocking . It had that feel of a romantic comedy where everything that you expect happens. The film just veered along smoothly and that was the problem. In other Liam Neeson movies, 'Taken' and 'The Other Man' come to mind; There were twists galore , which made for an exciting movie going experience. It was clear this was along the lines of the Rocky series and other brand movie series , this was made simply for a big ,guaranteed paycheck. Not much thought went into this film. It was most likely rushed to get it into the theaters for that big payday. Shame on Liam Neeson, for this project. Hopefully, he stays away from Hollywood greed like this and becomes relevant again in his next film.",5,1,1,14 October 2012
Goodfellas," 'Goodfellas' or 'The Godfather'-Why do I have to choose?
","... Loved both. Goodfellas was based on true story of Henry Hill. This film had it all. Henry Hill started as a child being enthralled with the Mafia life. His dad just a regular working stiff . Henry was seduced by the life, the money, the excitement, the risks and of course the women. Excellent acting by all. This movie , singlehandedly , brought back the organized gang movies , we all loved from the 70s. In fact, this film was a segueway to 'The Sopranos'. Lorraine Bracco of 'The Sopranos' as well as Michael Imperioli ,in a bit part ,contributed to the fine acting. Throw in the character of Morrie and a wet behind the ears Samuel L. Jackson, and this ensemble ,was even more unbelievable. Perhaps the best acted movie of the 90's. This movie really portrayed the gang life in just under 2 and half hrs. If I do have one criticism, I think the film did not truly show the ordinary parts of life , that these people have when they are with their families, as 'The Sopranos. I did not take away points because 'The Sopranos' had all the time in the world to get away with that. This film , cleverly, pointed out how even top members of organized crime are not immune from violence or even from financial failure for that matter. I liked the narration by Ray Liotta. I think that really helped educate people , as to THE LIFE and the rituals of organized crime.This movie also did an excellent job with the costumes and the film set, to bring us back to these earlier dates. Movie can be squeamish at times, but it was meant to be realistic. You really do feel that you are a part of this group.",10,0,0,24 September 2009
The Proposal," Very Clich√© but better than expected
","Yes there were clich√©s after clich√©s and we know the ending before the opening credits are done. I wont tell by the way lol. Shades of 'Sweet Home Alabama' mixed with 'My Best Friends Wedding' and 'How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days' and throw in just about every other romantic comedy. I am not a big Sandra Bullock fan but have to admit, she had a fine acting job in this film , have not seen, her Oscar performance yet. Betty White was terrific as the spunky grandmother of our assistant Andrew to Margaret the chief editor aka shrew of a top notch publishing company. Faced with deportation, Andrew agrees to marry Margaret to save her life so to speak. Everything is not what it seems as far as Andrews life as well as with Margarets life. Some laughs and some tender moments and we have a nice film , albeit predictable. Ryan Reynolds was only ordinary as Andrew and that assessment is being kind. Worth seeing , but only if its for a buck or less.",7,0,1,20 March 2010
The Soloist," Solid Film But Not Groundbreaking
","For the most part this was an enjoyable film. However, I felt there were missing segments. I know this was based on a true story. I understand that Steve Lopez and Nathaniel Ayers , became unlikely friends and formed an unlikely bond , that inspired one another. I get all this , but again , the film was just a miss. The film featured fantastic acting performances , but the lackluster gaps in this film, through no fault of the actors , I might add, kept this film from being spectacular. Nathaniel Ayers a musician, a brilliant one at that, never realized his dream due to mental illness. Being a homeless person, Steve Lopez, journalist from the L.A. Times smelled a story. Rather than being just another cold story to fill a column quota, Mr. Lopez, gradually became attached to Ayers, thus a human bond developed with true, friendship bonds and no ulterior motives for Lopez. Do not get me wrong this was a nice story and particularly the later part of the movie brought this film from being just an average film to a pretty good film. There were some heartwarming moments and tears but I never really felt a kinship toward the characters, as I usually do in some 'select' moving films. This is definitely worth a watch , for the acting performances alone. Jamie Foxx was equally as good in this film as he was in 'Ray' and of course, we know that Downey Jr. shines in , whatever he does.",7,3,5,2 January 2010
Up in the Air," Interesting, Creative Film
","This was a true pleasure. A creative, innovative effort that shined. The acting from all the characters was spectacular. George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham; A man whose life is spent traveling around the country , mostly in the heart of America firing people. In fact , He is a part of a contracted consultant team that does the dirty deeds. Bingham not necessarily a man of low morals or standards, is none the less immune to his devious chores, much like a QB knowing he is going to take a big hit every down. Mr. Bingham loves the first class travel and perks that go with his position. Enter young ,naive, Natalie Keener , hired to reorganize the Consultant company ,with objections from Bingham. They end up in the air together and both learn some valuable lessons in life . Further muddling the situation is Alex Goran, a female companion during those lonely times traveling for Bingham. This was a film that explored human emotions from every spectrum. There were some fine twists in this film . The film also shed some light on our cold culture of technology . Is it better to be fired in person? Is it better to be fired via webcam or perhaps a text? The word firing could be replaced by the words 'breaking up'. This film went beyond Binghams job and highlighted some personal relationships, involving his family and his meaning in life. Mr. Bingham the word master was a servant to his own emotions.",9,1,3,7 February 2010
