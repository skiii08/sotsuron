3:10 to Yuma," Best Western movie and story in this decade
","3:10 to Yuma. What a great Western. I was interviewed on some show after I saw it and it was almost too soon for a complete reaction. Oscar worthy, yes: for story, for costume, editing, and maybe even one for acting. Christian Bale and Russel Crowe are in a really worthy battle for the best man on and off screen.The story is so great. The pieces fell into place like a mortise lock. Unique, chambers of steel, contradicting shapes that distinctly turn from one contradiction to another. It was so contrasted from the bad to good and came together in a dance between characters that found respect and humanity in battle.What is an enemy? When did paths go apart? The subtext of family vs. outlaw & Fatherhood vs. orphan fill me up with their individual parts, essential is the parallel and the rough setting. Everyone struggles to survive and defend the deepest core values. These outcasts with these values that made them come together. Words took on deeper meaning as they were few enough in an action filled western. Fascinating ideas rolled together seamlessly into this movie.It was like a song really, with a harmony and haunting melody that allowed you to drift into identification with either main character. I was on the edge of my seat wanting, rooting for a wonderful outcome. I got it in parts, in spades and with a huge dose of loss. How can I describe a great movie without giving any of it away? Just to say go see it. It is entertaining and a great body of work. The eyes have it. They have made this a really wonderful movie. It will leave you thinking. It will leave you grateful, compassionate and disturbed.",10,5,10,9 September 2007
