Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Another great addition to the franchise
","OK, sure...at first glance you might not think that I'm a fair person to be giving such a glowing review for Phantom Menace. Yes I wear a Star Wars baseball cap. Yes, Boba Fett's on my keychain. But trust me, I wouldn't lie to you. I LOVE this movie. I've seen it a bunch of times in the theatre & a couple times on video & it still stands up. And, I'm not afraid to admit, I was a bit hesitant of the new movie. What if it doesn't live up to the first three. What if George embarasses himself with a subpar effort. But from 20th Century Fox's opening drumroll right through Boss Nass proclaiming 'Peace', I was completely & wholeheartedly enthralled. What do I say to the naysayers? Maybe they forget that these movies are made for 12 year old's. Maybe they've lost their sense of wonder & can't go to a movie, sit back & suspend their disbelief anymore. Maybe they're jaded with adulthood. Who can say? All that I know is despite some negativity to the movie, a hell of a lot of people liked it. And I hate people who pick at it for dumb reasons. They think that it's a continuity error that in Episode IV Obi Wan said that when he met Anakin he was allready a great pilot. I don't see the problem here. Lil' Anakin was a great pilot when they met. Anyway...I don't want to rant. I loved Episode I, am looking very forward to the next two, and congragulate everyone at Lucasfilm. 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,1 June 2000
X-Men," A big budget comic book movie that succeeds on all counts
","I'm an independent moviemaker in Canada that aspires to do big budget blockbuster summer movies. I'm also an avid comic book reader. But, I hate Marvel Comics & the X-Men. Have for ages. So I can't say I was exactly looking forward to this movie. And I never ever thought I'd LOVE this movie. Bryan Singer (who directed the also excellent 'Usual Suspects') & his fellow X-Moviemakers did an amazing job translating these characters to the big screen. Relative newcomer Hugh Jackman gives what may end up being a breakthrough performance as Wolverine. Only die-hard X-Fans may be a bit upset by how some of the characters are adapted to their motion picture versions (Rogue is quite different than the sexy southern bell X-readers are probably used to). My favorite thing is that they didn't have a cheesy top 10 soundtrack to accompany the movie (as they did with Mi2 & other such summer fare). When a movie comes out that's based on something that's already beloved by a large # of fans (whether it's Hamlet, X-Files, Batman or Silence of the Lambs), the key is to appeal to the worshipers AND the people who've never heard of the thing before. Rarely does this succeed, but with X-Men, they pulled off a movie that should be enjoyable to both forms of viewers. I give it my highest possible recommendation. Go see it.",10,0,0,14 July 2000
