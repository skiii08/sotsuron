The Avengers," MARVELous
","'The tesseract has awakened.' spoken in the opening scene, picks right up where 'Captain America: The First Avenger' and 'Thor' left off. S.H.E.I.L.D director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is forced to call upon earths mightiest hero's to stop the self outcast Asgardian Loki.Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk, along with Black Widow and Hawkeye, are the only hope to save the world from an invasion, and boy do they in an instant superhero classic. Possibly the best thing about The Avengers (or Avengers Assemble in the UK) is that each hero has grounded powers the exception being Thor (unless you count Hulk's strength as a super power), which makes the Marvel hero's more believable than their DC. counterparts.There's drama, action, comedy, and some amazing CGI, and thankfully doesn't fall into the same category as the not so fantastic Fantastic 4 movies. Mark Ruffalo, replacing the underwhelming Ed Norton, excels as Bruce Banner/Hulk, which is without a doubt the best on screen version of the iconic hero after the awful 2003 'Hulk' movie and 2008's slightly improved 'The Incredible Hulk', as well as Ruffalo and co star Robert Downey Jr. Playing Tony Stark/Iron Man for the 4th time, having some fantastic chemistry in a scene on-board the Hellcarrier.Chris Evans plays Captain America perfectly as the man out of time, Chris Hemsworth is believable in his role as Loki's Brother (like in Thor) Scarlett Johansson is the surprise of the movie though with a lot of the action revolving around her Black Widow, the only major disappointment with The Avengers is that Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye is underused. That being said every hero gets decent screen time to justify their appearance as well as everyone having a big part to play in the fantastic final sequence.However, The Avengers towers over every superhero movie in recent memory with the only real challengers being X-Men and The Dark Knight Trilogy, Joss Whedons hit is sure to please Marvel fans and the everyday movie goer. Next up for Marvel studios, Iron Man 3, cant wait.Best quote in the movie: Loki:'How desperate are you that you call upon such such lost creatures to defend you?'If you enjoyed watching: X-Men, Fantastic 4, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Incredible Hulk, you'll enjoy watching The Avengers (Avengers Assemble).",10,26,47,5 December 2012
Avatar," Aving a ball
","Having not made a feature length movie since his 1997 box office hit 'Titanic', James Cameron returns to the directors chair for his most ambitious movie yet, the CGI spectacular, Avatar.Origionally planned during post production of Titanic, Cameron was told the technology was simply not available to make Avatar and its easy to see why. Every scene is a visual treat, from the opening sequence to the ending credits.Sam Worthington (Clash Of The Titans, Terminator Salvation) stars as paralysed ex-marine Jake Sully, who takes up a once and a life time chance to travel to Moon planet Pandora after the murder of his scientist brother Tom. After arriving at the humans marine base Sully is quickly thrown into the world of science as he meets Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore) the scientist that went through Avatar training with Tom. From there Jake has run ins with Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) the head scientist of the Avatar Programme who is non too happy about the last second switch between Tom and Jake. Then Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) who wants Jake to use his marine skills in his alien body to infiltrate the natives home.During his mission Jake is taught the ways of the locals by their future leader Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) which leads Jake to question his allegiances and his morals, which ends in a fantastic final battle between a less advanced alien race and the gun ships and technology of the human marines with special effects that will leave you feeling like a child again, but then thats what you'd expect from a James Cameron film. despite its near 3 hour running time Avatar never gets boring.The special effects, as well as groundbreaking, are absolutely stunning, especially when you consider that its really motion capture and a lot of green screens. Also a lot of that is down to the cast who put in memorable performances both the Avatars/Na'Vi and Humans making this a fantastic journey which really makes you care for the characters. Sam Worthington puts in a breath taking and emotional performance, as well was Joel David Moores underrated performance as Norm, and it must be said Sigourney Weaver makes the slow transition of villain to hero during the movie.Helped by a supporting cast that includes; Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao and Laz Alonso, Avatar proves to be one of the best Sci-Fi in recent memory and for once a feeling of originality in the script, as well as a director passionate about his movie. Avatar ticks all the boxes as a fantastic movie, Welcome back James.Best quote in this movie:Jake:'I was a warrior who dreamt he could bring peace. sooner or later though, you always have to wake up.'If you enjoyed watching: Aliens, District 9, Planet Of The Apes, you'll enjoy watching Avatar.",10,2,4,15 February 2013
Speed," Over The Speed Limit
","If you take John McClane and put him on bus, you get Speed, and like Die Hard there's action, Comedy moments, one liners, more action, and a fantastic script. Officer Jack Travis (Keanu Reeves), off the back of winning a medal along with his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) for foiling a terrorist attack on a hotel, assumes that terrorist is dead having heard the bomb explode, only for him to be alive and already have his next target, a downtown bus filled with passengers.The reason: he wants $3million, The catch: if the bus goes below 50mph the bomb will explode and if anyone gets off the bus the bomb explodes, leaving it up to Jack to try and save the day by racing after the bus and getting on it and somehow hoping it doesn't run out of road or gas. its tense and exciting with thrilling moments, particularly a scene in which the speeding bus must jump and near 50 foot gap in an unfinished bridge. Even for a movie with such a clever script there is plenty of time for fantastic action sequences and will probably leave you disappointed that the movie isn't longerWith an all star cast including: Sandra Bullock, Joe Morton, and Dennis Hopper, along with a twist about the villain and some clever writing, Speed puts you right in the passenger seat in a fantastic action movie that has its sad and romantic moments. Speed will end up making you hope you don't run in to many red lights or traffic on your way to work.Best Quote: Harry:'You shot me, I can't believe it. They're giving you a medal for shooting me, you little prick'If you enjoyed watching:....Die Hard, Eagle Eye....you'll enjoy watching Speed.",7,0,0,17 February 2013
