The Hangover," The Hangover: A Good Hair of the Dog
","If some good, clean fun is what you're after, The Hangover is not the film for you. The film will, however, deliver two out of three (minus 'clean').Director Todd Phillips (Old School, Starsky & Hutch) offers as much raunch, wit and general shock value in his newest comedy as the typical laugh seeker could ask for, and though The Hangover doesn't quite reach the same level of true humor as Old School, it comes close.The film centers around the aftermath of a Vegas bachelor party, the events of which unfold as the celebrants – sans the missing groom to be – investigate their nocturnal circumstances in order to find their friend amidst the worst hangovers of their lives. What they find far surpasses the embarrassing photo or puke-stained clothes that usually accompany the day after woes of a night of bad decisions.Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms deliver solid comedic performances, but it's the uniquely odd yet amusing qualities of Zach Galifianakis' performance that transform the film into the laugh-out-loud movie it is. A supporting role of bubbly Heather Graham also brings the film some charm.Watch for appearances by Mike Tyson; Matt Walsh, Bryan Callen and Dan Finnerty (some of Phillips' staples); and Mr. Phillips himselfall of which add an extra 'hey!' factor to the keen observer.The Hangover doesn't breach the cosmic levels of comedic genius we always hope for, but it makes for an amusing evening. Worth full price.",7,1,3,23 June 2009
Terminator Salvation," It was loud. It was cool. Was it good? Not really.
","Terminator Salvation offers everything one could want from a film that promises continuous action and striking visual effects, except a viable plot. Director McG brings us the fourth installment of the popular Terminator series, in which Judgment Day has already occurred and the few survivors of earth have joined to form The Resistance against the machines. We see John Connor (Christian Bale) as the ever promised leader of The Resistance and Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) as a teenager fighting the machines in post-nuclear LA. The film revolves around Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), an ambiguous criminal turned hero who signed away his body to Skynet before the war.The audience is treated to the audio and visual effects of our time, which transform LA into a post-nuclear wasteland, invent terminators larger than we have ever imagined and bring the war to a new level. The audience is also subjected to an unrealistic (even for a Terminator film) storyline and, dare I say, too much actionnot to mention Christian Bale's constant guttural voice which sounds suspiciously like his Batman character.In the end, the special effects of Terminator Salvation are not special enough to mask the vapid plot or to bring it up to par with its predecessors.",5,2,4,4 June 2009
