Marie Antoinette," History buff??
","If you want to learn the history behind Marie-Antoinette, go to the library and check out a book. If you want to watch a fun little film based on the idea of Marie-Antoinette, go see this movie.I liked the movie plan and simple. I love history and really enjoyed that this was NOT a movie just about the history. The movie left me wanting to actually learn the real history of Marie-Antoinette, while loving the fun and fashion of the period. This movie brings us some lush colors and vibrant characters, some that I wish could have been explored more, but all in all I was entertained and enjoyed the movie.If you want to learn the history of Marie-Antoinette, this may not be the film for you. If you want to enjoy Sofia Coppola's telling of a legendary life that has become almost mythical, check out this movie.",8,6,10,21 October 2006
