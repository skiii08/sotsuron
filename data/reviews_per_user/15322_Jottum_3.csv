Requiem for a Dream," Shivering
","First time I saw it; my emotions ran up quite high. I first thought it was a really awful movie; but later I realised, that when a movie causes that kind of feelings, it has to be a brilliant one!",9,0,0,29 September 2001
The Fast and the Furious," Nice streetcars
",This is really a feast for the eye and ear of people that like cars. One shouldn't expect too much of the story; but hey: one does get an awful lot of extremely good looking streetcars from the beginning until the end! Recommended for car-freaks!,8,1,1,29 September 2001
Driven," The Horror
","I am a complete freak when it comes to cars.Even so, the sight of this movie was a complete horror. Ofcourse there were some nice shots from CHAMP-car races, however every accident was (from a technical point of view) a disaster. Cars spinning ten times, flying through the air, a steel-bar chassis, fuel which blew with a big explosion, CHAMPcars in the streets of Detroit, a circuit ran in Germany instead of an oval... Don't watch this movie if you happen to watch motorsport on a regular basis.",2,1,2,29 September 2001
