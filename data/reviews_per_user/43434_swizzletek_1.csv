Alien 3," What the hell happened.
","This writer completely ignored the sequal set up from aliens. he could have used these great new characters, hicks, and newt. which helped make aliens such a great success. i think they should get james cameron pretend the 3rd n 4th didnt happen and do another third starting at the end of the second and do it right. i know this cant happen but it sure as hell should. this writer blows.swizzletek",2,1,2,14 August 2003
