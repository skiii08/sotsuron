Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Best movie I've seen this year
","I went into this thinking 'Oh no, not another book to movie adaption fail!' But I decided to go in with open eyes and I was SHOCKED! The movie had great acting, an actual story - not filler, excellent special effects and entertainment! Best movie for me by far! A must see!They didn't mess around with the history too much. They showed Abe as a young boy - briefly. They moved on and showed you the strength behind Abe Lincoln and the family man. Not just the President. I found the special effects were similar to 300...which I thoroughly enjoyed.I see that this movie has an average of 6 out of 10 stars. I have no idea why. Critics are rarely right and I think there hasn't been enough feedback from people who went to this movie. I hope the movie gets the proper credit in time.",9,12,20,23 June 2012
The Revenant," This is a re-make of a movie - Not a new story.
","This movie sounded familiar. So did a little research and surprise! It's a knock-off from a movie from 1971. It's not an original story and the original was much better. Check it out yourself.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067388/ MAN IN THE WILDERNESS 1971.Quoted from the movie: 'In the early 1800's, a group of fur trappers and Indian traders are returning with their goods to civilization and are making a desperate attempt to beat the oncoming winter. When guide Zachary Bass is injured in a bear attack, they decide he's a goner and leave him behind to die. When he recovers instead, he swears revenge on them and tracks them and their paranoiac expedition leader down. - Written by Alfred Jingle'",2,13,24,14 January 2016
Split," Acting good - story bad
",I have to credit the acting. It was very well done and I have to say that they are the reason I enjoyed it to a 6. But the story was very slow and very predictable. No shock. No awe. No surprise. Just MEH. This was more of a 'drama' than an actual 'thriller'. I found A Cure for Wellness had a lot more substance and story than this one.,7,0,9,22 February 2017
Get Out," 1 hour and 8 minutes until ANYTHING HAPPENS
",I have no idea who is rating this movie so high. It has to be people who entered the theatre about 30 minutes into the movie. Otherwise...why the high rating for a movie that did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING until over 1 hour into it? The story dragged and droned and dragged for over an hour. Sorry...Not worth the time or the ratings it's receiving. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the acting was great.,4,17,37,9 March 2017
The Witch," 100% fake movie reviews
","This movie has nothing to do with witches, nothing to do with horror and everything to do with a low budget sedative. Ignore the fake reviews of rating this movie 5 or above. This is the problem with reviews...95% are lies. THIS is the truth. A majority of us claim this rubbish show is 1 - 3. THAT is the true movie rating.Judge for yourself and take the time to read the real reviews. The others are paid or they are friends and families of the actors, directors, producers, and anyone else affiliated with this crappy movie.Since I am forced to type a minimum of 10 lines of text...I will stress again...do not waste 90 minutes of your life. Don't waste $1.99 to rent it. Simply walk away and know the truth.",1,4,14,10 June 2016
It Chapter Two," Rollercoaster movie...
",This was good - in the second half. The beginning was a repeat of the old and original IT...then it started to get good...then they used a scene from the Movie The Thing (head part)...then they used a scene from Alien (Underwater). It FINALLY got good in the last 20 minutes.,5,0,0,1 February 2020
Kong: Skull Island," Kong is a hero!
",This movie is NOT - I repeat NOT a remake! It is a new story that will take your breath away and you will never see what is coming. The acting was great...the story was fantastic...there wasn't a dull moment during the entire movie! STAY after the never-ending credits...there is a surprise at the end of those...That's all I can say. GO SEE THIS MOVIE! I'm going back to see it again next week!!!,10,3,6,14 March 2017
Wonder Woman," Long and BOOOORING movie!
","I was generous giving it a 5 out of 10. There were 3 action scenes and the last scene was the best...and it was the end of the movie!Why the hype? Why the praise? It was boring for over an hour! Yes, you need story build-up...but NOT THAT MUCH! Disappointed in this so-called blockbuster when there are many better movies that are getting poor reviews!",5,31,66,7 July 2017
