It," They finally nailed it with a Stephen King adaptation
","When it comes to horror, Stephen King is regarded as being the master. Not everyone agrees with this, but there are very few people that would disagree that It knows which buttons to push. It is one of King's most recognizable works due to his play with coulrophobia, otherwise known as the fear of clowns. I've personally read some of the book and I've seen the 1990 version starring Tim Curry as Pennywise. This version had its pitfalls and unfortunately brushed over some details that would have helped it stand a bit stronger as a film adaptation. For these reasons, I was a bit reluctant to see yet another Hollywood remake for something that I wasn't sure even needed a remake in the first place. Let's take a closer, spoiler- free look at what this remake offers.The Good: All the kids played their characters extraordinarily well. Normally I'm not the biggest fan of children actors, in fact most of the time I'd prefer they not be in movies or shows. Nothing is worse than when you're in the moment of watching a good movie with a solid performance from the entire cast, then some little **** jumps in and yanks you out of it with terrible acting. For this I can say that I was impressed to see all the kids own their characters and behave like actual, non-acting kids. I was also curious to see how Finn Wolfhard of Stranger Things would follow up in It and he absolutely nailed it as Richie. He played the perfect little, wisecracking smartass that Richie is in the book which is a sharp contrast from his role in Stranger Things. Good things are on the horizon for him for sure, let's just hope he doesn't follow the road of other children actors, ahem Corey Feldman.The story ended up being vastly different than that of the 1990 version, which in my eyes is a good thing and is also kind of risky. I felt that the first film captured the spirit of the book a little better even if it wasn't perfectly executed. Overall though, I can understand why they made changes where they did. First being that the story is set in 1988/89 and the time lapse will bring us to 2016, allowing modern technologies to be a part of the story as well as making it generally more relevant to a younger audience. The key points were kept in place which made the minor changes along the way seem ultimately insignificant. The story still takes place in Derry, Pennywise is still Lord Commander of the sewers and the Barrens are The Loser Club's stomping grounds. If anything, some of the changes add motives to character's actions which I liked quite a bit (IE; Georgie's fate, which if you've read 10 pages of the book it's not really a big spoiler).As far as the horror element goes, I wouldn't really define this is being the scariest thing I've ever seen. They did a fantastic job with the atmosphere and making each scene uniquely creepy, but 90% of the scares are predictable. That's not a terrible thing because they didn't rely entirely on jump scares (although there are a few) and they focused more on building tension through the course of the film. There was also plenty of variety in the ways that Pennywise antagonized the kids, and I do love a creative villain.Speaking of which, I haven't forgotten Pennywise, the star of the show. The biggest concern most people (including myself) had was that the costuming and characterization of Pennywise came off as too menacing and therefore not in the original spirit of what Pennywise is in the books or the original film. Despite his gnarly makeup and fancy Victorian getup, he had a lot of qualities that made him friendly to na√Øve children but just creepy enough not to trust. I was not disappointed in what they did with Pennywise and I loved his interaction with the kids in the final confrontation.The Bad: I'm not one to nitpick too much at CGI since most movies have it now, but there were definitely a few moments that I felt weren't necessary to use it. It wasn't all terrible, but it was often used whenever Pennywise was around and there were some scenes that absolutely did not need it. Practical effects aren't always perfect so I'm not saying that it's the cure-all in this situation. The film seemed to rely very heavily on CGI and I'll be curious to see how this holds up down the road.As much as I like Richie, he's also probably the sole source of the R Rating. The writers tried to throw in as many F-bombs as possible and I'm not entirely convinced that it was necessary. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a solid R rated movie, but that's a rarity in theaters now because most studios are afraid to lose money over it. For this reason, every instance of 'fuck' in the movie felt somewhat forced just so that they could get the rating they wanted. Then again, most 13-year old boys usually don't know how to communicate outside of using expletives (and neither do I), so maybe it was the appropriate amount of usage and I'm just nitpicking.Check out the rest of this review and more at TheCynicist.com",9,3,5,27 September 2017
Us," Home Invasion/Thriller
","I think this movie was awesome. I think Us is the real highlight between the two that Peele has directed so far. I've seen reviews upset about the 'plotholes' because not everything was spoonfed to them, or that it wasn't scary enough, or whatever. That's fine, but to me this had most of the essential components of a great horror film and I think it'll be highly regarded in the years to come. I highly recommend watching this one.",9,0,3,17 September 2019
It Follows," Fresh, original concept for a horror movie
","It Follows is an original concept compiled into what can only be explained as an artistic horror film. It was released in 2014 but has gained some traction over the past few years and landed on many 'must watch horror' lists. The concept is that 'it' will follow whoever the carrier is, which is passed on through sex to a new carrier. Not the kind of STD that your doctor is going to write you a script of penicillin to clear up. So, buckle up and let's do a spoiler free review of It Follows.The Good: The first thing you're probably going to ask yourself while watching this movie is what time frame this is set in. The style of clothing could match the modern-day hipster or young adults that are fashion savvy. The settings and most of the technology or lack thereof (other than some weird shell e-reader thing) could also lean towards being late 70s/early 80s. It makes for an interesting approach to the overall atmosphere and according to the director David Robert Mitchell, it's intentionally filmed this way to create a dream effect (AV Club). It's a very cool spin to what is already an interesting concept for a movie.The build of suspension in this movie is phenomenal. The score is constantly building tension, as Jay (Maika Monroe) is eluding her stalking demon. The beauty of it is that half the time you never actually see the monster and when you do, it often looks very ordinary. Yet the director still manages to build a sense of dread without going in the direction of making it hokey. Like horror of old, the director created a slow, steady and unrelenting monster which will constantly keep you on edge. They could have very easily gone with an over-the- top CGI monster but I'm certainly glad they went with a far subtler approach. This movie will make you think twice about anyone slowly walking in your direction.This film is also paced very well. It Follows wastes no time in introducing you for what's to come and manages to stay consistent for the entire film. The director manages to make an almost two hour film feel like an hour. Jay and her friends are quick to start coming up with some ideas on how to evade the creature and buy some time to really assess the situation. I love when characters in horror movies play it smart by developing and executing plans that don't suck. Whether they're all successful or not is a totally different story.The Bad: Now that I went on my whole rant about great plans and execution, I have to add a caveat and say that they also had some really dumb ideas and lack of trying other approaches. I understand horror and most stories in general, at their core rely on characters failing to execute plans. I would for once like to see a horror movie try all rational approaches that a real person would try just so that the audience would feel like there truly are no other options. Throughout the film I was coming up with all sorts of different ways that I'd deal with this and I was a bit disappointed that the scope of their creativity was so limited.Some of the characters seemed either totally unnecessary or became annoying in their persistence that the monster wasn't real. Personally, if I saw a door get blown in half, I'd probably start believing the girl that's freaking out about an invisible creature stalking her. Yara (played by Olivia Luccardi) is by far the most unnecessary character as she basically has no lines other than 'What's wrong?!' whenever the creature approaches and Jay starts freaking out. Dude, you know what's wrong, stop asking.The Judgment: The flaws of this movie are minor and easily overlooked because of the great concept and storytelling of the film. I believe that this was a solid mark on the new age of horror films and showed that it's not dead yet. David Robert Mitchell managed to bring back the spirit of old horror and give it a fresh spin. I'll definitely be looking out for a sequel to this movie that may hopefully visit the origins of the demon or conclude the story in a more permanent way. I strongly recommend this film if you're looking for a solid, original horror.Check out this review and more at TheCynicist.com",7,0,0,27 September 2017
It Chapter Two," Supernatural Horror
","If you're a fan of Chapter One, chances are highly likely you'll be a fan of Chapter Two. It hits all the same beats of the first, but just hits a little harder. It can be a tough act to follow when you've already created one good movie and you're up against the reputation of a well-known series and novel, but they absolutely did it in my opinion. If you suffer the symptoms of a small bladder or have a really short attention span, I might recommend waiting to rent so you can watch at your leisure. Otherwise, I'd recommend going to see this for anyone who enjoyed the first.",8,0,1,17 September 2019
Mother!," Aronofsky stepped a little too far out of the box
","What the **** did I just watch? Darren Aronofsky is notorious for making some seriously strange movies. Mother! is no exception to the rule and even takes it to another level. Which I'm not sure is a good thing. This film is certainly geared more towards a niche audience looking to wrack their brain on allegories and I'm surprised it wasn't a more limited release for that reason. I'm not calling the general public dumb, but studios tend to shy away from releasing movies like this out of fear that they won't get return on investment. The story begins with a woman and her husband (no, they don't have names) who live in a home seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Their tranquil existence is interrupted by visitors with questionable motives. Let's take a closer, spoiler-free look at Mother!The Good: Darren Aronofsky films like to play with your senses, and that is exactly the case with Mother! This film really appeals to them as you hear every floorboard creak, every exasperated breath and even the pulse of the house. This helps build tension and set the mood for events to come. It gives you that gut anxiety feeling when you're hearing every single little noise as things around the Mother gradually become more chaotic. This makes the breaks of silence eerie in a way, because you become so used to the white noise around her.The Bad: I'm sure there are going to be people kissing Jennifer Lawrence's ass for the next year or so because of her performance. But I was bored with her character and irritated with the way she and others were written. I understand that they were all intentionally written this way to deliver a story, but the characters responses to certain situations just seemed so unnatural. If anyone showed up at my door in the middle of the night, it would have to be a seriously extenuating circumstance for me to let them stay. When others showed up, I'd probably be throwing punches. Maybe that just makes me an asshole, I don't know. I could sympathize with the Mother, but I was hard pressed to find a character that was actually likable in any way.The pacing of the film seems painfully slow and makes an already long movie seem much longer. I don't need fire and blood raining around me to be entertained but there were only a couple big moments that really got me engaged. Aronofsky has done it right before by balancing drama, suspense and even a little horror (IE; Requiem for a Dream, which if you haven't seen you should). Mother! has all these elements but they seem disproportionate, which tends to make things drag quite a bit.From start to finish, this film keeps you guessing as to what the hell is going on. The world that the mother and him (Javier Bardem) live in seems to be something out of a dream, yet it could really exist. I really enjoyed the mysterious aspect of the film but I also felt somewhat misled. The trailers made it seem as if this was going to quickly devolve into a devil baby movie, but believe me you're going to be far more confused than that.So, is too weird a bad thing? I'm occasionally down to watch an indy, artsy film but a few ride that line of being outright strange. This movie tore right through that threshold and actually made me wonder that question; is too weird a bad thing? In some cases, yes. It appears to be a cohesive story but I was constantly asking myself if any of the film is really supposed to be happening or if it's some sort of hallucination. It's not strange like goats talking or anything like that, but just the behavior of the characters and the general setting seem peculiar. In Aronofsky fashion, the last fifteen minutes of the movie will probably leave you horrified and when it's all said and done you're going to feel like you just snapped out of a dream. Nevertheless, there's a message to be gained from the movie and it's an interesting ride to say the least.The Judgment: I honestly walked out of a dead silent theater not knowing what to think or say about the film, guessing that others around me felt the same way. It took me a little bit to digest the message and make sense of everything that I saw. If sensory stuff or artsy movies irritates you, I wouldn't recommend seeing this film. If your curiosity has gotten the best of you or you're a fan of indy films, go check it out. Personally, I didn't like this movie much at all, but I've seen and enjoyed a few other Aronofsky films so I'm just chalking this one up as a fluke.",4,16,28,27 September 2017
