The Blair Witch Project," Don't bother
","This movie was not nearly as scary as the reviews indicated.  It was also almost unwatchable due to the shaky, erratic hand held camera work.  The hand held technique would have been effective if used sparingly at certain times however as a way to shot an entire movie it was annoying.  A good premise with failed execution.",Null,0,1,1 August 1999
