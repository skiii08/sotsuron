Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the top 4 greatest movies ever!!!!(along with the other 3)
","How in THE heck can some of you posters give this film a thumbs down???NO plot??? come on. You are all nuts.This movie ranks right up there with the other 3!!!! Qui-Gon Jinn is great, Obi-Wan had a purpose for being underused and Anakin did fine. The FX are the best ever. Ian McDiarmid did AWESOME as Palpatine and Sidious (Oscar worthy)!!!On to the issue about the plot. I have read alot of reviews on here saying the plot was bad. Look, I follow this stuff on the internet fans sites and let me tell you, this plot was BRILLIANT!!!Now think back to the original 3 movies. In them, the Empire ruled the galaxy, Darth Vader had killed and destroyed all the jedi knights to the point of extinction. Basically the galaxy was in the 'dark times' as old Obi-Wan told Luke in his home.Now the question with the prequels is, how do we get there?Episode 1 starts out at a time when the galaxy was in peace for the most part. The buetiful design of Naboo certainly depicits what the galaxy was like in the glory days of the Old Republic. The design of Naboo is very romantic and sophisticated looking, with beautful builings and vistas.As the movie opens the jedi are sent to the Trade Federation Battleship to negotiate a trade dispute between The Federation and the Naboo. In a few minutes the jedi are attacked and forced to flee, where they stumble upon an army of battle driods getting reading to invade Naboo. They decide that they must contact the chancellor and warn the Naboo. They then get on the trade federation landers and ride them down to the planet. Soon they finally get the capital of Naboo (Theed) where they convince Queen Amidala to go with them to the capital of the Republic, Coruscant, to plead her case to the senate. To convice them to order the Federation to stop the invasion.
Once they escape the planet and their ship is damaged they must land on Totooine for repairs where they end op meeting Anakin. This part of the story is self-explainitory. So I will not talk about this part.But as far as the political aspect is concerned, is actually a 'phantom' plot. Unless you are thinking or are up on things you totally miss out on the point of the political conflict.I'll try and sum it up:Basically what you have here is political corruption by a certain individual with his goal to rule the galaxy. The sith, an ancient cult of evil force users long believed extinct, is reimmerging. Their goal is to destroy the jedi and rule the galaxy. The master sith is Darth Sidious. Many may have though that he looks alot like The Emporer from Return of the Jedi. Well, I got news for you, that is the same charactor in his pre-emporer days. The movie also contains a charactor named Senator Palpatine, who appears to be a nice helpful senator supporting Amidala in her cause. It becomes apparent to even casual viewers that he suggests that Amidala more or less remove Chancellor Valorum from his seat as president of the galaxy. Well, there is a reason. The reason is THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON IN THE ENTIRE STAR WARS SAGA!!!!! AS most Star Wars fans know, Senator Palpatine IS played by the same actor that played The Emporer in Return of the Jedi. Let me let you in on a fact here. Senator Palpatine and Darth Sidious are the same person!!!! As it turns out, he has a masterplan, so that the sith can rule the galaxy. Its simple. Take advantage of the cowadrly Trade Federation and cause this big trade dispute with Naboo. Force the planet's queen to go before the senate to plead her case. Then convince her that the Chancellor is weak and is on the payroll of the federation. As Palpatine say, 'enter the beurocrats. the true rulers of the republic. Not to mention on the payroll of the federation I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength disapears.' He convinces the queen of this so she can oust Valorum and 'push for the election of stronger chancellor'. Obviously as mentioned, Palpatine ends up being nominated then elected chancellor. Once this happens, it marks the beginning of the downfall of The Pepublic. And it ushers in the beginning of the rise of the sith and the Empire. Sometime in Episode 2, Palpatine should reveal himself as Darth Sidious, reveal his true masterplan, and decalr himself Emporer.The negatives I have heard about Phantom Menace is that it is is pointless. Everyone knows the Empire to be the main enemy of the saga. Which is true. Episode 1 tells us the story of how things fell into place that eventaully led to the empire. The Trade Federation was used only as mear pawns in Palpatine's masterplan.If you miised out on this major plot point, then you entirely missed out on the point of the story. Its really about corruption. And what the reult can be if hate and coruption overcome compasion and love.This was the best movie of the year bar none!!!",10,8,10,12 December 1999
