Minority Report," Minor Report of 'Minority Report'
","I've never struggled as hard through a movie as Spielberg's 'AI', but 'Minority Report' is so far out, I wonder if Spielberg has had a nervous breakdown or is off his Paxil.  Used to, when a person didn't understand a movie, the consensus was that it must be brilliant.  One had to read something deep into it or find the inner truth. In my opinion, just as 'AI', the truth is this movie is boring. The supporting cast of Colin Farrell and Steve Davis is about the only good thing in the film. With all the special effects presented this year...a la 'Lord of the Rings', 'Star Wars II', 'Harry Potter', etc. was 'arm-waving' the only convention Spielberg could come up with to create Cruise's imagery of the future? It looked ridiculous. Cruise makes a fortune choosing bad scripts, substituting action and screaming scenes for acting. He's no actor...he's a screamer who likes to play anger, as does Denzel Washington and Dylan McDermott.I'm certain that Cruise never saw a TV episode of 'Mission Impossible' where a lot of characters with specific talents teamed together to form a team...BUT NOT! Cruise has to be the whole team with NO help!! Let's see...'Mission Impossible' One and Two...'Eyes Wide Shut', 'Magnolia', and now this piece of schlock...'Minority Report'. I rushed to my video store the day that it was put on sale and bought it. The next night, I went on ebay and saw dozens of idiots, such as I, putting their used copies of 'MR' on sale for five bucks.  Yeah, I sold mine too. Tom, you need a new agent and Steve, you need a new script reader. You're both WAY OFF BASE! Get back to the things you do best and forget these 'message' pictures where no one gets the message.",Null,0,0,24 December 2002
Troy," MY! MY! We've seen the film so let's knock it!
","First of all, Wolfgang Petersen did not set out to film 'The Iliad'. 'Troy' is another account of the story BASED on 'The Iliad'. I get so tired of the critical remarks on this site. People go to a sneak preview and rush home to IMDB, rarely with anything positive to say about this or ANY picture. The talent assembled in this cast and crew was enough to sell me a ticket and the film DOES deliver! Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom showed off their talents well in the given roles. I didn't expect to see a Laurence Olivier performance. I got what I paid to see. The crowd and action scenes are spectacular and did NOT disappoint. This movie ranks extremely high above the shlock of ninety minute teen pix which open every weekend and make millions and are found to be inane and unfunny. But 'Troy' is a true epic in the truest sense of the word. Because we now have access to CGI, it is better than 'Ben Hur', 'Spartacus', or 'The Ten Commandments'. Don't be misled by early criticism. Go expecting what you want the film to be and you won't be disappointed. I wasn't!",Null,5,10,8 May 2004
8 Mile," A bad rap, 'Rocky' style...
","OK, I finally decided to break down and see what all the critical hooplah was all about. Fortunately, I waited for the DVD to come out so that I could see the subtitles and read the lyrics that are almost impossible to decipher from listening to them. Wow! This was a tragic story.  A young misguided youth lives on the right side of the tracks or rather (8 Mile).  He longs to be on the other side of the fence where everything is not greener, but blacker. He writes rap music, well maybe not music, but he can rhyme connected sentences. Our hero, Rabbit, is handicapped from pursuing his goal. You see, he has the problem or rather the stigma of being white.  Poor kid! He gets his chance to compete against the King of the Rappers, but it's early in the movie. If he succeeds in winning, then the movie will only be fifteen minutes long and we can go home before we get a headache. But this film isn't ordinary. It has the distinction of being a Curtis Hanson movie. We can expect more and exciting things to happen. Surely our hero won't fall in love with the rich white girl!!! That would be too conventional. He must somehow find a way to move out of his mother's trailer which she shares with a kid about our hero's age. What can be mother's problem by dating her son's school mate. Did I hear correctly? She's angry because the mate won't perform oral sex on her when she's hasn't bathed in many a day...and there's not a bathtub in sight. Good grief! Mother is handicapped by filth and odor.Now let's get to the good stuff. I haven't read such accolades about a young actor's performance since James Dean appeared in 'Rebel Without a Cause'. Mr. Eminem is versatile. He can managed to look sad like a puppy dog or he can elevate it to one more emotion...an ANGRY sad puppy dog.  Sometimes he went from one expression to the other with such agility, I got goosebumps. I'll bet he's magnificent in still photos. like a CD cover. Oh My! Some 90 minutes later, after seeing Rabbit's best friend, blow off his testicles (with a real gun!), it's time to build the epic to a climax.The 'comeback kid' gets another shot at beating the King of the Rappers. Will he freeze as he did before? We he be able to create lyrics on the spot about things that are happening now, all with a syncopated beat which can change tempos at will, whenever he needs to? The mounting tension is too much for the average theatergoers heart to stand. If you see it, make sure you have a 'nitro' tablet handy to place under your tongue. The least you can do is to take a Xanax before the movie starts. I won't spoil the ending. You'll be thrilled at the conclusion if you've never seen 'Rocky', 'Hoosiers', 'Rudy', or countless other ripoffs.  It will ruin it for you if you can outguess the predictable ending.  Will he win, finally? Will he decide he's out of the rich girl's league? Or will he walk off alone down a dark alleyway looking for the sunset and trying how to look like a happy sad puppy dog? I can't wait for the sequel! I guess I'll have to settle for other pieces of Hollywood schlock until then...you know...movies starring Nicole, Brad, Julia, Tom, Colin, Meryl, Rene, Gwenyth, Matt, Ben, Cate, Catherine, Anthony, Mel, Bruce, and other talents lesser then Eminem in the meantime. WHAT A FILM! '8 Mile'! A landmark in cinematic history. It ranks only slightly above, 'Dude, Where's My Car?--the sequel'.",Null,0,0,19 March 2003
