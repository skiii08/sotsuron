Source Code," A Close Examination of One Scene
","SPOILER ALERT! Although the plot defied logic to me, there was one scene in particular that I liked more than any other scene in the movie. I'm referring to the freeze-frame scene near the end of the movie when the camera slowly zooms out from 'the kiss' to pan across the frozen-in-time faces of other passengers on the previously doomed train of death. Aside from my curiosity as to how technologically this shot was realized, there was a much deeper fascination that appealed to me. Here were the smiling faces of individual personalities rescued from an alternate reality where they smiled no more as the ashes from their fading faces fell to the floor. I immediately began to reflect on the many thousands of souls whose mortal bodies were unjustly destroyed on September 11, 2001 and then I began to forget about the total number reported (a cold statistic) and I began to imagine what it would be like to have really known each and every person prematurely released from this world on 9/11...appreciating the subtle intricacies of each man and woman and child (including future projections of the unborn ones from expectant mothers who were snuffed out before they even had a chance to see their babies take their first breath)...taking the time to clearly focus on each one of them as a unique (one-of-a-kind) child of God just as the glass lens in the scene from this film took its time to allow that same kind of visual perception of each person to slowly sink in. And it's worth mentioning here that there was also some dialogue about LIFE near this scene that helped lead this train of thought to wherever it was going. Life. Death. Life Again. I mentioned God already. He was in there somewhere...inside these thoughts of mine. I'm not sure what He was saying. But I think perhaps He wanted me to know that this is what their smiling faces look like to Him when He puts them all back together again on the other side. God is good at fixing things that are broken, you know.",7,1,3,28 January 2012
The Adjustment Bureau," My Thoughts
","I found this movie to be an inspirational tribute to the 'one God and Father of all, who is above all and in all' as well as being a good reminder that the sovereignty of God is unlimited. The universe was not inevitable. It is neither an accident nor some self-existent entity of ethereal proportions exploding upon the empty stage of nebular nothingness. The universe is a work of creation and is therefore wholly subject to the will of the Creator. So it is no mere poetic expression that exclaims: 'The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.' 'He removes kings and sets up kings.' 'The Most Highs rule in the kingdoms of men.' In the affairs of the hearts of men and women, the Universal Father (better known as GOD) may not always have His way but in the conduct and destiny of a planet, the divine plan prevails...the eternal purpose of wisdom and love triumphs! And unlike any documentary that may have attempted to encapsulate portions of these philosophical mysteries in a few condensed scenes featuring talking heads that move their lips in a rapid succession of lingual fireworks but who fail to say anything spiritually significant, this fun-filled flick was supremely entertaining in addition to being a cinematic fountain of intellectual fascination and cosmic enlightenment.",9,1,3,28 January 2012
The Da Vinci Code," A Code Of Lies
","This movie is a cleverly contrived character assassination targeting Jesus of Nazareth and Mary Magdalene constructing the premise of the plot upon a multi-layered foundation of lies so outrageously slanderous by their very nature that had Jesus himself decided to make an unannounced appearance at the world premiere of this dastardly flick, I can imagine more than one smart lawyer handing Him their business cards. And the producers of this cinematic spectacle of the disgraceful desecration of He Who So Magnificently Fuses Divinity And Humanity (thereby revealing God to Man and Man to God), these very same self-serving producers of carnival-like deception saved one of their biggest lies for last as the final credits rolled and this appeared on the screen: 'The characters and incidents portrayed and the names herein are fictitious, and any similarity to the name, character or history of any person is entirely coincidental and unintentional.' Coincidental? Unintentional? Do they seriously take those of us who are spirit-born students of the Life and Teachings of Jesus (and everyone else for that matter) to all be perpetually silent, unthinking puppet-fools who shall turn a blind eye to the absolute absurdness of all their blatantly false assertions, preposterous speculations and unfounded accusations that are only magnified exponentially by their unapologetic attitude regarding their profane propagation of blasphemous baloney masquerading as a work of so-called fiction?! Judas Iscariot got thirty pieces of silver to sell Him out. What did they get? An adjusted amount due to inflation minus one suicide.",1,4,7,24 June 2010
Signs," A Meaningful Pattern or Random Chaos?
","Is faith (the supreme assertion of human thought) desirable? Then must the mind of man find itself in that troublesome predicament where it ever knows less than it can believe. This supernatural thriller intricately weaves a well-crafted story about one man's journey of faith as he deals with the uncertainties of life and the vicissitudes of existence. And what I personally found to be a refreshing change from other flicks I have seen that have dealt with a similar theme is that this movie is just as entertaining as it is enlightening. It shines a bright flashlight upon the inner roller coaster of faith and yet gently illuminates in a subtle way that I found to be neither preachy or condescending. I also enjoyed the light-hearted moments in this movie well executed by a superb cast of talented actors portraying likable characters blending in just enough humor to balance out some of the more seriously intense scenes of dramatic tension. All in all, there were signs that this was going to be a really good movie from the beginning to the end and I believed them even before I knew for certain.",8,1,4,13 January 2011
Contact," Are We Alone in the Universe?
","As someone who believes that there are literally trillions of inhabited planets out there in the cosmic playground of outer space and that much about their origins and destiny (as well as those pertaining to our own planet) have been revealed and documented within the last century in a series of 196 Papers known collectively as The Urantia Papers (or The Urantia Book) that were authored by various Beings-Not-Of-This-Realm who were commissioned to bestow this epochal revelation upon our planet including translating it into the English language (since English is not the native tongue of either our local universe of Nebadon or our superuniverse of Orvonton or of the Paradise-Havona Central Universe of Divine Perfection which is the dwelling place of the eternal God and around which everything else and everyone else revolves in accordance with the superuniverse plans of evolutionary progress and spiritual attainment), I was predictably pleased to watch a movie that to me asked: Are we really all alone in the universe of universes with this vast enormity of wasted space encircling us like lifeless set decoration or are we rather a part of some gigantic undertaking that is fusing perfection and imperfection and blending science and religion into one creatively unfolding project that is beyond our mortal comprehension to fully fathom and that involves other living beings on other inhabited planets who are in the truest sense, our cosmic cousins? So when I gaze into the starry heavens at the countless suns of space, I marvel at how seemingly insignificant it would superficially appear that our planet is and yet just as this movie highlighted the important role that faith plays whether in regards to believing in a Higher Power or believing in the existence of alien beings far removed from our galactic proximity, I do have faith that our sphere (Urantia) is just as precisely administered and just as lovingly fostered as if it were the only inhabited world in all existence.",8,4,8,9 March 2011
