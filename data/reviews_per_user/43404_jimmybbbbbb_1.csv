The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," the worst film i have ever seen ..
",a total waist of 2hrs + drawn out to a painful and slow ending.. rubbish don't think anyone can sit through so much mush. story line is so weak it makes me want to cry . cant believe they can put out so much rubbish in one film 1 fight in the movie if you can call it that . which i would not . i think in future i will be staying well clear of any more of this saga Zz .to tell you the truth there ain't much between any of these films in the saga . the same long and boring films .i cant think anyone would leave the cinema feeling anything but drawn down from watching this rubbish .to complete this review i have to have ten lines . lol i could tell the sory of this film in one word. rubbish. the end .,1,8,13,26 November 2011
