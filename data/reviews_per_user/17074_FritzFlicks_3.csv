Child 44," Marginal at best
","I was really looking forward to Child 44, a movie starring Tom Hardy, with Gary Oldman supporting, does the content even matter? The answer yes, the content still matters. I'm not big on reading the book that a movie is adapted from, but in this circumstance I may have to pick it up and give it a read. Since I'm not sure whether it was poorly adapted or somehow the idea of murder in the soviet union, at a time when murder 'wasn't possible' in a communist state, turned into a boring film.The performances of Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace were uninspired and very bland, with the one bright spot of Gary Oldman turning in a solid role, as has come to be expected from him. The movie felt like 3/4 propaganda and 1/4 thriller.The child murders are brought up randomly throughout the first hour of the movie, while a picture is painted of a unstable husband wife relationship, and then a conflict thrown in to move the story along slowly. By the time the murders come to the for front of the film, and a loose connection is drawn to give an idea of who the murderer could be. By the time it all comes to a conclusion you're just hoping the movie will end given its two hour plus run time.All an all they're probably worse uses of your time, but there are certainly better options. They certainly could have done a better job of bringing the thriller aspect more and leaving everything else out.",5,11,27,20 April 2015
Ex Machina," Visually stunning and emotionally intriguing
","I was very excited to see Ex Machina because, Oscar Isaac has been on fire with the movies he's recently starred in including Inside Llewyn Davis, A Most Violent Year, and The Two Faces of January. I also was intrigued in how AI would be shown in the film and how it would compare and or contrast what was shown in Her.The film opens with some expansive views of forests and rivers and wilderness in general, which is a rather interesting setting for what turns into a high tech idealistic movie. As we are introduced to each of the three main and really only characters in the film, it sets up quite an interesting three way relationship.Ex Machina keeps you guessing throughout and you're left entertained and fascinated all the way through. The relationships set up between characters is always interesting, and the questions brought up about morality and the future are very relevant. Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson, and Alicia Vikander all turn in solid roles, and they really had to considering they are the only three who have speaking roles throughout the film.Ex Machina does a great job at showing and not telling, and allowing you to make up your own mind until the conclusion. Its always thrilling and certainly worth a view for anyone who is a fan of science fiction as its certainly a unique and original take on something that has been churned out plenty of times before. I strongly encourage people to see it, as I gave it an 8 out of 10! Happy Viewing!",8,1,10,21 April 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Cinematic Action Masterpiece
","Mad Max: Fury Road stars Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky, alongside Charlize Theron as Furiosa. Its the 4th installment of the Mad Max series albeit 25 years after the 3rd film. It takes place in a post apocalyptic world sometime after the last film Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. It was pegged as a sequel with a loose connection to the first three, and the first to star Tom Hardy playing Max Rockatansky as opposed to Mel Gibson.'In a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, two rebels just might be able to restore order: Max, a man of action and of few words, and Furiosa, a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homeland.'George Miller when asked what first came to mind for him to explain the film said its a '2 hour chase scene'. He sure wasn't joking, besides 10-20 minutes the entire film is one giant chase scene. Its non-stop action, with different beautiful real scenic shots of landscape and some death defying real stunts. From an action standpoint its perfect even better when seen in 3d, it feels like you're apart of the heart pounding action.When you dig a little deeper there are a few flaws, the big one being a complete lack of any real character development. If you saw the original three films there was a decent amount of character development, along with a polarizing of Max Rockatanskys actions, going from kind and caring to downright cruel, Fury Road lacked all of that. The second big flaw is its R rating. With minimal more cuts it could have easily dropped to a PG-13 rating and it would have been fine and more widely viewed(Don't worry anyone who's timid, its barely an R). However since it was rated R already they certainly left some possible scenes that would have made the film seem more real off the table.What I can say for sure is the best way to go into Mad Max: Fury Road is with an open mind, an expectation of great action, great landscape shots, and a disconnect from the original trilogy. When viewed in that light the film becomes so much more enjoyable, it almost made me wish its title and its main characters names were different, so this film could stand on its own merit and not be compared or likened to the original trilogy.That being said it was a solid 8/10 as a film, but based purely against action movies as of late I would easily give it a 10/10, its non-stop, and its great. Its defiantly worth seeing in theaters, as I'm sure its viewing power will decrease when not in 3d, and certainly in home theaters. Happy Viewing!",8,2,7,15 May 2015
