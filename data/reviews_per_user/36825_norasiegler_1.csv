It," Scary, Addictive and By Far The Best Movie I Ever Saw!
","While watching this movie I was terrified! I saw it 2 days ago but still I truly am obsessed with this movie! The actor that played Bill Dembrough (Jaeden Lieberher) was amazing! Even though I nearly peed myself for sure I would love to see this again! Overall I think that this by far is the best movie I ever seen! The jump scares were phenomenal (sorry if I spelled that wrong). While watching it you will be creep-ed out but by the end it will be the only thing you think about and will obsess over it. I really recommend this movie, but only if your ready to get scared because there are scenes that made me cry they were so scary. My final statement is that you will fall in love with the story, and with the actor/actresses, I recommend seeing it with a friend and or family member. This movie will make you appreciate your friends and love them so much more, plus I would be horrified if I wasn't accompanied cause really this is a hugely scary movie! 10/10 <3",10,2,4,7 October 2017
