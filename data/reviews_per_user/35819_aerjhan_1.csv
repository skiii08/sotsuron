Lucky Number Slevin," Entertaining
","This movie has humour (not hilarious), good(not impressive) acting and a story to tell. Action is limited but present and most of the characters are almost interesting. One flaw is 'OBVIOUS' though; in order to be unpredictable they have created too many twists and it shows. (Honestly, i will be really shocked if one of these days a movie is not mutilated by trying to say 'SURPRISE..., WE GOT YOU! DIDN'T WE?'. That was the weak part of the story. Still the film manages to remain enjoyable, i relate this to potential. To sum up, i could recommend to my friends watching this film if they asked because its one of the better films released in 2006 but don't expect too much.",7,5,11,24 June 2006
