The King's Speech," The King's Speech-Wonderful Film Helps Toleration for Stammering ****
","Am hoping that this film will capture the 2010 Oscar for best picture.Colin Firth gives a stupendous performance as George the VI, a man who is suffering due to his stuttering. Helena Bonham Carter gives an understated performance as his sympathetic wife, desperately trying to help her distraught husband.The film is so rich in history with the abdication of King Edward, and the coming of World War 11 discussed.Geoffrey Rush, as the speech therapist, is absolutely memorable. He not only is Bertie's therapist, the two develop an ever-lasting friendship that carries them into the king giving his pep-war speech to the British people.How many of us knew that George VI had this handicap? Firth's performance is such that you will develop an attachment and deep sympathy for him.Oscar night should be a night for people with stuttering to share in the greatness of this movie.",9,1,2,5 February 2011
Saturday Night Fever," Great Fever to Catch ***1/2
","John Travolta truly shines as dance hero Tony Monero in this wonderful 1977 production of 'Saturday Night Fever.'When Friday night comes around, Tony can quickly forget about the rest of the week, get those dancing shoes ready, dress up and head down to that Bay Ridge Disco and dance the night away.The songs from the Bee Gee's are great. Shockingly, they were not nominated for best song among the Academy Award nominations. Why not? What was the nominating committee thinking?Tony has his problems at home and frustration at work. Dancing becomes an outlet for him and what an outlet he has. Fast on his feet, Arthur Murray praised Travolta's dancing in this film;although,prudish Arthur and Katherine objected to the language.We see the lives of average Italian Brooklynites on the streets of Bay Ridge as well as the disco.Complications ensue. Tony's brother, a priest, comes home and announces that he is leaving the church. There may be homosexual implications but that is fortunately glossed over.Karen Lynn Gorney is an excellent dance partner for Tony. Usual TV good girl, Donna Pescow turns in a surprisingly good performance as a girlfriend rejected by Tony.There is plenty of excitement beyond the dance floor. That memorable scene on the bridge, where tragedy befalls a pal of Tony's, is terrifically done.Get out your dancing shoes and dance up a storm. This is sure one fever well worth catching.",9,0,1,20 January 2006
Moneyball," Moneyball Hits A Home Run ****
","This is one of the best baseball pictures that I've seen in years.We all know that the game has become one of expensive contracts for the players. Brad Pitt portrays the Oakland A's General Manager who hooks up with Jonah Hill, a definite look alike for Josh Mostel, son of the late great Zero Mostel. They really radically change the way the game is built upon. It's not just getting the so called best players and getting big money, it's based on computer analysis and all else goes by the boards.Pitt gives a wonderful performance as the General Manager. The movie goes into flashback mode to show his failure as a player.With the team slumping, he shakes things up and presto, there is a 20 game winning streak.A definite great film dealing with ethical dilemma. Philip Seymour Hoffman stars as the questioning manager. As always, Hoffman is not easy to recognize in the film.This is really baseball at its best.",10,0,1,21 April 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," This is National Misery's Book of Secrets *1/2
","Even with a stellar cast of Nicolas Cage, Jon Voight and Helen Mirren, nothing can really save this desperately pathetic film.I really thought I was in for a good civil war production on those really responsible for the assassination of President Lincoln. Instead, we go all over the place while searching for an ancient city of gold. Only through such a miserable script could Cage be able to figure out the outrageous clues that are left.As far as Queen Victoria siding with the Confederacy, forget that. Yes, it's true that the England needed the south's cotton, but the former wisely chose to be neutral in the conflict.We have chase scenes in London, England to rival that of a James Bond thriller.The problem with this film is that they let the theme go complete awry and the result is an absolute stinker of a film.",3,2,4,20 June 2009
Million Dollar Arm," *** 1/2
","What made this movie so good was that it finally presented baseball in terms of having fun and not necessarily the money angle which has become so prevalent in this major American sport.Jon Hamm was excellent in the role of the agent who goes from seeing the big money angle to the exact opposite.He goes to India to recruit prospective pitchers for the big league in an attempt to sign them at big salaries. He finds his guys and brings them back to the U.S. but after a series of disasters brought about due to the psychological, social and cultural differences between countries, he sees them fail miserably at tryouts.It is only when he comes to see that baseball is not solely an investment,that success is achieved in the end. There were times that Hamm's facial expressions reminded me of his Don Draper of 'Mad Men.' There are the usual disasters, love interests and other items deemed comical, but in the end it's the human element that allows for success to be achieved.",9,1,2,24 February 2015
Black Swan," Black Swan-The Dark Side of Dancing **1/2
","Remember when Ronald Colman copped an Oscar for going berserk as a Shakespearian actor in 1947's 'A Double Life?' Natalie Portman is about to do the same as a ballerina going off the wall in 'Black Swan.'The ballet scene, especially the showing of Swan Lake is beautifully staged. Did anyone see the similarity between her Natalie's movie mother and Anne Bancroft in 'The Turning Point?' Both gave up ballerina careers to pursue families. Of course, this 'Swan' is certainly no 'Turning Point' either.As the conflicted ballet star, Portman turns in a credible performance which will probably be honored on Oscar night, Feb. 27th.As viewers, we are ourselves conflicted. What did ballet director, an excellent Vincent Cassel, and fellow ballerina and rival, Mila Kunis both do to add to Portman's madness? Kunis, at the beginning of the film, acts as though she is a young tough right out of the gangs in 'West Side Story.' Cassel, as the driving choreographer, is excellent in the role.Portman's downhill descent into madness occurs too quickly. True, that Cassel wanted her to be more devilish in the twin role of the evil Black Swan. It's as if Portman has become the Norma Desmond of ballet. She was certainly ready for her final take, no matter how tragic that was.",5,2,6,5 February 2011
Changeling," Changeling- Strong 1920s LAPD Corruption Setting ***1/2
","Lengthy but worthwhile Clint Eastwood film dealing with police corruption in Los Angeles in the late 1920s.Angelina Jolie gives a worthy performance as the mother of a kidnapped boy, victimized by the police when she refuses to accept the child they find and claim is hers as her own son. This shows and leads to a massive cover-up of the LAPD. When the police chief commits Mrs. Collins (Jolie) to an asylum for refusing to play ball with them, we see the corruption not only of the police department but the asylums of Los Angeles during this period. I thought that I was going back to Olivia De Havilland's 'The Snake Pit' in 1948.The film is well directed as usual by Clint Eastwood. Great how she shows the simultaneous trials of the man accused of killing the son of Mrs. Collins while the LAPD heads are tried for what they did to Mrs. Collins. Getting through that asylum was almost like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'The main problem with the film is that it is too long. It could have ended at least 20 minutes to one half hour before.",9,2,5,24 February 2009
The New World," If this is New, Give Me the Old World 0*
","Very boring film which is conducive for sleeping. You will not need the sleeping pills after seeing this one.The story could have been told in about 20 minutes about colonization in Jamestown in 1607.The stereotyping is there as the natives are with painted faces, aggressive behavior and the women are practically in the nude.Colin Farrell is a renegade who escapes death from leader Christopher Plummer. The latter soon returns to England to get supplies. How lucky he is to get away from this dull picture.It is told in narrator like setting. Even the battle scenes seem contrived.Enter Christian Bale. The head of the tribe has fallen for Farrell, but thinking he is no longer here, goes with Bale, a widower. Then we see the 'My Fair Lady' come into view where the woman, who learns to speak English rapidly goes back with Bale to England married with a son. Re-enter Farrell as the film ends.The plot here is absolutely meaningless.",1,3,9,16 August 2006
Frost_Nixon," Frost/Nixon is No Icing on the Cake **1/2
","Disappointing film which chronicles the famous David Frost/Richard Nixon television interviews.The film is basically a dud since we already know how devious and vicious the late president was and Nixon was really suffered from a dull personality. Frank Langella, who portrays the 37th president, is very wooden in the part but I guess that is what you would expect.Pat Nixon's role was never able to evolve in this film and the way the interviews are conducted are unduly boring. By the time that Nixon admits that he let the country down, we may not even care about this.Gerald Ford was criticized and ultimately lost the 1976 election because of the pardon of Mr. Nixon. I can't really pardon Ron Howard for making this film. San Clemente never looked more beautiful, but that's about it.",6,1,7,30 April 2009
Walk the Line," Walking A Great Line ****
","Joaquin Phoenix gives a beautiful performance as the late Johnny Cash. Phoenix, who did his own singing, is absolutely superb as the late singer, who had a rough childhood with an abusive father whose disdain for him increased following the tragic death of his brother.Reese Witherspoon portrays June Carter, the love of Johnny's life. Ms. Witherspoon, though adequate in her acting, really has a supporting performance and why she has been nominated in the best actress category is an enigma to me.The picture belongs to Phoenix all the way. His characterization of fame, fortune, drugs and downward spiral are well done.The two sing quite well and the chemistry is great between them.",9,2,4,4 March 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat: Bring Back Censorship 0*
","After viewing this very poor imitation of a movie, I really believe that censorship needs to be enforced more so than ever in the motion picture industry.This film is a disgusting, vulgar attempt at comedy. It fails miserably. This picture is highly insulting to Jewish people. Other groups are made to look like fools as well. As someone of the Jewish faith, Sacha Cohen should be ashamed of himself in participating in such nonsense.The scene with the feces is vile. I had to run out of the room when this is shown.From the first scene, I expected a far better movie. Once he comes to America, the film goes downhill rapidly. A monumental mess.",1,2,10,14 October 2007
The Monuments Men," Monument Men-Is this Film Really A Work of Art? ***
","The film is good in the sense that we are reminded that we fought World War 11 for the maintenance of our cultural values in society.George Clooney gave a so-so performance. He spoke as if he were just mouthing his words plainly. It is only when he takes a captured Nazi criminal to task regarding the latter's anti-Semitic views that he is somewhat more powerful.In her own way, Cate Blanchett steals the film as a French woman working at the Germany ministry during France's occupation knowing full well what is going on with Nazi Germany looting art treasures for themselves. While it appears that she is a collaborator, she is supplying information to her brother, who is killed, while he is working for the resistance.Clooney, Bill Murray and John Goodman were just too old to be cast in their respective parts.",8,0,0,22 October 2014
Miracle," Miracle-On Ice ***1/2
","Kurt Russell gave an absolute towering performance as the U.S. hockey team coach in charge of getting his team to defeat an excellent Soviet team in the Olympics in this 2004 film.The picture reminded me greatly of the 1988 basketball film where Gene Hackman was also quite a stickler.Though the Russell character of Herb Brooks did ultimately have a heart, he drove his players. His making of players repeat certain items for hours on end was memorable.The picture has a back drop of events occurring in our nation from the turbulent times of the late '60s and '70s. The hockey contest between the U.S. and the USSR became one of a political nature due to the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.Patricia Clarkson plays Russell's wife. She is understanding and when push comes to shove, she stands by her man.",9,2,3,8 August 2013
Captain Phillips," Captain Phillips-America: We Have A Problem ***1/2
","An American ship bringing cargo to the African continent is hijacked by Somalian pirates. The hijacking in itself goes awry and instead of taking the $30,000.00 and fleeing, the pirates instead kidnap Tom Hanks, Phillips, and this becomes a constant film of tension with the Navy seals on hot pursuit of the terrorists while trying to get Phillips back safely.There is tension among the pirates as you can imagine. Hanks shows the right emotion of a person in such a precarious situation.It also goes to show you that the pirates will hurt their own people in order to attain their selfish ends.Hanks gives a superb performance and is well-matched by Barkhad Abdi, a former Minnesota chauffeur, who was nominated for best supporting actor as the pirate leader in this 2013 film.",9,1,3,17 May 2014
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Perks...Please Stay Introverted **
","To all shy freshman out there: You're certainly better off being introverted, especially after you see this rather odd film.Taken under the wing of two seniors in high school, our hero is a withdrawn young lad who craves for attention and is involved with his friend, better commonly known as his diary.This is certainly not your coming of age film. Dylan McDermott, as the father, and Ms. Cusack, who portrays the mother, have relatively little to do in the film.A wallflower would not have this kind of life. At least, our hero develops somewhat of a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, though it is quite weird, which best describes the entire film.After the other two graduate and go off to college, our hero breaks down and we soon can guess what really happened to his aunt and what she had down to him.His course of therapy in the film is minimized. It would have been better to focus on the problem that drove him to an institution and to see his cure develop. Instead, he is cured too quickly.",4,2,9,12 November 2013
3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 To Yuma- You Can Afford Not to Be On Time for this One **1/2
","Russell Crowe does not exactly sound western here as Ben Wade, an outlaw who is vicious and cunning.The movie becomes preachy at the end when Crowe and Christian Bale, who delivers a great performance, become too friendly. Does Crowe try to show he is a person with a conscience when he reveals at the end that his mother gave him a bible to read and then abandoned him at age 8? Does he become sympathetic to the plight of rancher Bale, who wants to bring him in to face justice so that he can collect money to save his family and ranch.The part where the sheriff and posse abandon Bale and his son represents a complete reversal of the 'High Noon' concept.Crowe and Bale are natural enemies who come to understand and even aid each other. The ending will sadden but shock you. Nevertheless, the concept that there is good even in the worst of people is cliché here.",6,1,4,9 January 2008
The Sound of Music," The Sound of Heavenly Music ****
","Despite its historical inaccuracies, 'The Sound of Music' is an outstanding film.I never forgave Rex Harrison for opening up the best actress envelope and quickly saying the winner is Julie...and then pausing. He looked right into the eyes of Julie Andrews and said...Christie for 'Darling.'Note that I said inaccuracy. As an historian, I would be remiss if I neglected to mention that Maria did not marry Georg Von Trapp in 1938 as the film suggests. They wed in the 1920s. In fact, by '38, as the anschluss engulfed Austria, the Von Trapp children were mostly grown. One son had just graduated from medical school.With this inaccuracy, we still have a glorious film about a singing family and a woman who came one summer as their governess and wound up marrying the widower.Julie Andrews is just picture perfect as Maria, the woman, who was not destined to become a nun. Christopher Plummer is excellent as Georg, who loved his children, but whose love had to be brought out by Maria. Eleanor Parker was quite effective as the baroness. She saw Maria as a rival and attempted to get rid of her. When Maria returns, she bowed out gracefully.The cinematography is breathtaking. Austria was never lovelier. The songs are staged beautifully. Who can forget I Have Confidence, Going on 16,and My Favorite Things? It's all glorious. The dancing throughout Austria was marvelously staged by great choreography.The children are just adorable and so memorable. Charmaine Carr, portrays the eldest, Lisle, at age 16. Actually, Miss Carr was 21 when the film was made and Julie Andrews was 28!Too little credit is given to Marnie Nixon, who portrayed Sister Sophia. Few people knew that she did all the singing for the nuns in the rendition of How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? She even sang for Peggy Wood in the latter's rendition of Climb Every Mountain. Miss Nixon, who sang for so many of the stars in films, was never given the credit she so aptly deserved.Norma Varden, known for playing erudite women in smaller roles, played Frau Schmidt, the housekeeper. Few people know that Miss Varden was set to play the Peggy Wood role of Mother Superior. At the last moment, Miss Varden was replaced by Wood.Go see this film over and over. The chemistry between Andrews and Plummer is terrific.Richard Haydn, as the music impresario is great. His line of 'how many men that you know confer with their children on their honeymoon' was memorable. Ben Wright made for a wonderful villain who later becomes the town's gauleiter after the anschluss takes place.A film for all occasions, never to be missed.",10,1,7,21 May 2006
The Equalizer," **1/2
","One thing that remains constant in this action packed thriller. Denzel Washington's mysterious former life remains just that throughout the movie. What organization did he work for? Who were these two people from the group that we briefly see.Settling down to a quiet life following his wife's passing, that is all upset when he meets a Russian girl, most likely a hooker, who is being harassed by her Russian gangster mates.The rest of the film is devoted to Denzel assuming a Rambo role and killing the first group, which sends others after him. All we then see are violent, horrible ways that Denzel kills his prey.",6,0,0,6 October 2015
The Longest Yard," The Longest Yard Touchdown! ****
","By far, Adam Sandler's best film as he portrays a disgraced ex-football player caught up in a point shaving scandal and sentenced to probation. When he goes on a drunken spree, he lands up in the typical southern prison-in Texas- where head warden James Cromwell is out become governor and arranges a football game between the inmates and the guards.The idea that prisoners are also people is well presented here. There is plenty of racism, not all in a comical way, that depicts life in a southern prison for African-Americans.Faced with being charged as a co-defendant in the murder of an inmate, Chris Rock, Cromwell tries to force Sandler to throw the game.",10,0,1,3 May 2014
Source Code," Source Code Proves that Terror is Terrible *
","This film needed to be decoded.I thought I was back with Mission Impossible. Actually, impossible is what best describes this film.Jake Gyllenhaal is a man on a train that is bombed on its way to Chicago. It's as if he has been caught between two worlds. He constantly goes back to the train and has 8 minutes to uncover the bomber each time. Each time the situation is different, but until he finds the bomber, the results are deadly.As if the family isn't confusing enough, we then find out that Gyllenhaal is dead. He had been killed in Afghanistan, but part of his brain was preserved so that he could thwart terrorism.Please, let's not take the real threat of terror and expose it to such inane nonsense.",3,0,8,16 May 2012
The Young Victoria," When Vickie Asserted Herself-Young Victoria ***
","Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend make an engaging Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in this interesting film. The problem that I found with it that while it is about Victoria's younger years, it should have been longer. Victoria was a champion of liberal rights, but the picture did not exactly show the reforms that she and Albert achieved in education, housing and the arts. This is merely printed before the credits roll at the end of the film.Her life was certainly not an easy one. Losing her father early and under the domination of a mother and her difficult adviser, Victoria had to put up with the regent King William, the dead brother of her father, the late king. In a brief supporting role, Jim Broadbent, a previous Oscar winner, is effective, especially in the scene where he insults his sister-in-law. Broadbent almost sounds and certainly looks like the late Art Carney.If this weren't enough, there were always political considerations in the family, which extended throughout Europe. There is a dominating prime minister and almost a calamity in a scandal involving the Queen's ladies in waiting. If this isn't enough, we have an engaging Albert ready to assert himself, and a near assassination attempt of the Queen.With all this considered, an hour and forty minutes doesn't give justice to what we're seeing.",8,1,1,10 May 2011
The Hangover," Hangover...And I Actually Liked It ***
","Ridiculous movie with one basic thing going for it: The plot is so off the wall that it actually becomes funnier as the picture goes on.Three guys take their friend for a weekend in Las Vegas from California. The guy is supposed to get married. When the groom-to-be's brother-in-law, who is totally off-the wall, drugs the other guys, the film goes into an odyssey of what the 3 guys go through trying to find their lost friend. We see them interacting with drug dealers, playing 21 at the gambling tables, meeting up with Mike Tyson and his tiger and all other forms of ridiculous adventures. Yet, believe it or not, the film is humorous.Bradley Cooper steals the show as Phil, the California teacher, who curses repeatedly and heads the group consisting of a dentist, the zany groom's intended brother-in-law and our intended groom, the latter who has gone missing through most of the film.It's rare that a zany comedy works now, but this film actually does.",7,2,4,15 May 2010
Ghost," Get Out and See It ***12
","The unexpected hit of 1990 earned a best picture nomination and a best supporting actress Oscar for Whoopi Goldberg's portrayal of Oda Mae Brown, a psychic delivering comic relief in a film.Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore are lovers separated by fate. The fate being that Swayze is murdered. Murdered by his best friend, played quite well by newcomer Tony Goldwyn, the great grandson of Samuel L. Goldwyn.There are some scary moments as the plot reveals itself. Oda Mae is hilarious at a memorable bank scene. Those devils coming out to punish Goldwyn and others are quite eerie but necessary for the plot to sustain itself.The movie discusses the fact that not even death can prevent love from being pursued. As hard as that is to swallow, you leave the theater knowing that love conquers all.",9,6,8,9 March 2006
Marie Antoinette," Sophia Coppola Bombs Again-Marie Antoinette-A Bore **1/2
","Kirsten Dunst is so stilted in the title role.She totally lacks the finesse of the 1938 Norma Shearer masterpiece. Jason Schwartzman seems awkward for the part of King Louis, which was so memorably created by Robert Morley in the '38 film.If you snapped your finger, the revolution would have passed you by. You do see the lavish living of Queen Marie and her cohorts. There is a new twist added here. Part of the reason that the people rebelled was because France was aiding the U.S. in its struggle against England. Interesting proposition.The excellent actress, Judy Davis, is wasted here as the Contesse, the head woman in charge of the manners of etiquette at Versailles. How many times do we have to view the morning curtains opening to see the royal couple in bed? Nothing has been accomplished during bedtime.Nice to see modern music intertwined in our story.In many scenes, prior to the revolution, Dunst appears that she is ready to cry. I'd join her if I had been in this sad imitation of a classic.",5,2,2,28 October 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the Lost Ark- Action At Its Absolute Best ****
","Superbly outstanding film. It has it all. A great story line, plenty of action and a historical perspective that is most interesting and possibly quite plausible.The lunatic Hitler wants the Lost Ark since he feels that with it, the German armies will be invincible.There is some irony in the film. Harrison Ford, as archeology professor, Dr. Indiana Jones is rather dull as he lectures the class. Go know that even though the first scene is action-packed, there will be plenty of action as Jones as lover played by Karen Allen, attempt to dupe and run from the Nazis all the way. I must say that the latter get exactly what they deserve at the end.Steve Spielberg filmed a non-stop action eventful film within an era of historical perspective.",10,1,2,12 December 2010
Spartacus," Spartacus! O Those Roman Rebellions ***
","A slave rebellion against the Romans led by Kirk Douglas, in the title role, is the main theme of this 1960 film.With a memorable musical score, the film details Spartacus and the near-successful rebellion that he led.Along the way, we meet Jean Simmons as his true love. They have a child but she flees at the end when Spartacus is hung by the Romans.As the head of a slave school, Peter Ustinov one the first of his two undeserved Oscars. Yes, I say undeserved. He should have won for his brilliant portrayal of Nero in the 1951 film 'Quo Vadis?'Tony Curtis is effective in the role of a faithful subordinate to Spartacus.",Null,1,3,17 January 2006
United 93," United 93 is Testimony to Profiles in Courage ****
","Outstanding film by director Paul Greenglass which depicted that awful day- Sept. 11, 2001 when America changed forever.With a cast of relative unknowns, Greenglass is admirably able to depict the events as seen by the Air-Traffic Controllers at various places while the evil plot of the day was unfolding.People viewing this masterpiece will be totally gripped by the action scenes as the dastardly plot came about. The tension is thick and well shown. You feel that you can identify with those passengers and attendants as they made those tragic cell phone calls to relatives to tell them how much they loved them.I was one who felt that it was too early to make such a movie. How wrong I was. This movie shall forever be in testament to the brave actions taken by those doomed souls on a day that will also live in infamy.",10,1,3,15 April 2007
Deja Vu," Deja Vu- Seen Too Much of this Already **1/2
","Someone should tell the writer of this film that if Denzel comes back from the dead at the end of the film, the lady who is alive is really dead because that's exactly what happened.When a ferry boat mysteriously blows up, killing over 500 people terror is rightly suspected. With terrorism on our minds constantly, this seems to be a good picture. The film virtually collapses when it becomes highly technical about using technology to get back into time. It is also very conveniently used to prevent this tragedy from occurring.The acting here is good but the problem is that these time-machine films boil down to the unrealistic. The film was often muddled as well.",6,0,2,31 May 2007
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. Really Stands for Extra Terrible-My Scathing Review *1/2
","The 1/2* is added due to the magnificent score of John Williams. No wonder Steven Spielberg used him in scoring films as well as Janusz Kaminski for cinematography. I believe that Janusz wasn't used for this awful film. Look. Even a genius such as Spielberg is entitled to a lousy film so this is the one.Who made up E.T.? He looks like Froggy the Gremlin or the gopher Marty Feldman, who was used by Mel Brooks.The film is dreadful. Doesn't the mother know what's really going on with the house turned upside down? No wonder her husband left her and ran off to Mexico, even though he doesn't like Mexico. Go figure that one out.That scene in biology class was ridiculous. What a poor teacher with that monotonous voice as our young star goes berserk and unleashes frogs all over the classroom. This is all because he is thinking of E.T.? Give me a break.Imaginary nonsense pervades this film. E.T. was pronounced dead and miraculously revives.The special effects are nice, especially the bicycle riding in the sky. However, the writing is putrid. It's just that plain and simple.",3,6,15,10 January 2010
Casablanca," Play it Over & Over Again Warner Brothers ****
","'Casablanca,' a memorable 1943 film,received the Oscar for best picture. In those years, the academy nominated 10 films. That practice would end the following year when only 5 films would receive nominations. While my favorite for 1943 was 'For Whom the Bell Tolls, I have to admit that 'Casablanca' is a film classic which will survive throughout time to come.Humphrey Bogart was phenomenal in the role of Rick, the casino owner who finds his love Elsa, so well portrayed by Ingrid Bergman. Problem is that Elsa has married Paul Henreid, who gives another excellent performance in the tradition of 'Now, Voyager,' which was the year before.Claude Rains is just great as the police official who knows that Rick is right in a setting with a pro-Nazi government.Who can forget the lines- PLAY IT AGAIN SAM, HERE'S TO YOU KID, LOUIE, IT'S THE START OF A BEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIP, ROUND UP THE USUAL SUSPECTS.Made during World War 11, the film evoked much sympathy from its audiences. An oddity in the Oscar voting was while the picture and director won, Bogart and Claude Rains, the latter in a supporting role, both lost the coveted Oscar to Paul Lukas and Charles Coburn respectively. Bergman was not nominated here but did snag a nomination that year for 'For Whom the Bell Tolls.'Casablanca has always been a sight for intrigue in motion pictures. It just continues with this memorable film.Keep playing it again Warner Brothers.",10,2,3,16 September 2006
Minority Report," *1/2*
","Sorry, but not even a minority of people could like this absolutely miserable film.With that red ball rolling down, I thought I was back at a ski ball center in Coney Island of many years ago.Pre-crime? Total elimination of crime due to the pre-cogs who can predict when a murder shall happen. This is absolutely totally preposterous, confusing, annoying and too much for the average movie goer to understand.I know that we have all aged but Max Von Sydow is totally unrecognizable here in his villainous-boss role.It takes us forever to realize that Tom Cruise's young son has been long-dead and that swimming pool scene was eerie and just a little too much to take, but that describes this film as well.",1,2,14,26 November 2016
Lifeboat," Lifeboat: Hold On to the Rafters ***1/2
","Alfred Hitchcock 1944 thriller where a group of survivors literally cling to a life-boat after their ship has been torpedoed by German submarines during World War 11.Quite a different and varied cast are on the boat. They're led by legendary Broadway star Tallulah Bankhead, who rarely made movies. She really captures the part of the writer who loses her worldly possessions little by little. As good as Bankhead was in the role, I wonder what Katharine Hepburn could have done for the part.Bankhead is ably assisted by William Bendix, a tragic figure who again shows that he has Brooklyn written all over him. John Hodiak, a seaman who find Bankhead as a love interest, and Walter Slezak, a German officer, who is also one of the survivors.After what has occurred, the picture shows little action but rather focuses on the interpersonal relations of the cast. There is talk of love, capitalism and just about everything else.",9,1,1,14 September 2013
In Bruges," In Brutal Bruges- Enjoy Belgian Waffles But Not this Stinker 0*
","After they make a hit in England, 2 killers flee to Bruges, Belgium where the violence really begins.This picture really makes absolutely no sense and eventually becomes nothing more than a blood bath.When Colin Farrell is ordered to kill a priest a young innocent also takes a bullet and for the rest of the film Collin Farrell begs for redemption for what he has done.An hour into this horrific film, Ralph Fiennes shows up as their boss and orders Ken to kill the Farrell character.We also have a Zeljo Ivanek taking a blank bullet to the eye and revenge and all other sorts of mayhem.Ken takes a plunge off a building and that's really disgusting at best.More shooting, more mayhem and we dare to call this black comedy?",1,13,43,27 April 2009

","If ever there is a real movement to curb the excess of violence in films, this should be the standard to show as an example.There is enough shooting and other forms of violence all over the place including dance halls, the church, on the street, you name it.The story in itself gets lost with all the violence that takes place. Everyone is screaming and running around while the guns are absolutely blazing.When a killer's wife dies, Keanu Reeves, the grief stricken widower, is soon robbed of his car and his beloved dog put to death by the son of a fellow gangster. As a result, all hell breaks loose and nothing is spared.This is nothing more than an overly violent film showing what killers do each other when the other is affected.",3,4,11,9 July 2015

","No wonder I detested science courses in school. Just like this film, they were boring.Sandra Bullock did an over the top performance as an astronaut caught up in space with colleague George Clooney. Bullock 'kvetched' her way to this Oscar nod and I'm glad she didn't win. Her constant moaning, though caught up in a precarious situation, became annoying. Clooney was also annoying with his charm and his stories. As you would expect, the special effects were quite good but not enough to sustain the film.After such a harrowing experience,we deserved more than walking away.",3,3,6,13 July 2014

","If you're looking for comedy, the 1983 remake of this film with Mel Brooks, Tim Mathieson, Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning is the film for you. That was absolutely hilarious. As for the original 1942 version, it is humorous, especially when you have Jack Benny playing the lead, but there are some moments of serious overtones.As the smitten lover, Robert Stack was incredibly wooden here. Perhaps, we can blame it on the fact that he was just beginning his career and given very little to say here.Sig Ruman is a standout as usual as Concentration Camp Earhardt, eagerly ready to blame his failings on Schultz. Benny and Carole Lombard provide the right chemistry as the Polish acting couple who eventually outwit the Nazis.",9,0,2,8 January 2013
Erin Brockovich," Erin Brockovich-Can't Judge A Book By Its Cover ****
","Other than 'Pretty Woman,' this was certainly the best Julia Roberts role ever and her Oscar was well-deserved.Roberts immediately comes on screen as a bimbo with a brain who has had 2 failed marriages and is really down on her luck as she struggles to raise 3 children.Fate has it that she meets up with an automobile accident and a lawyer, superbly played by Albert Finney, who she gets to hire her.Loud, common and ready to use her beauty as another Stella Dallas, Erin (Julia) soon shows her mettle by uncovering a major scandal involving the use of chromium as toxic waste with the result that plenty of people were ill from using the contaminated water nearby.Hardworking and caring, this undertaking changes Erin drastically. While she was a caring person with a foul mouth, she becomes much more mature as she works to have the gas and electric company found responsible for what has been occurring.The picture brings out that hard work with a purpose and the ability to persevere will always pay off.Besides a terrific supporting performance by Finney, Aaron Eckhardt is wonderful as her motor-cycle boyfriend who loves her and her children, but finds it increasing difficult to play second fiddle to a job that's rapidly consuming her.",10,1,2,13 August 2009

The film is terribly uneven with different characters just made to bounce around makes for a totally uninteresting affect.Yes, Cate Blanchett does give a solid performance but you just keep wondering and wondering what this is all about.The backdrops of the struggle for civil rights is lost in the absolute nonsense generated by the characters in this ensemble cast.

","What a ridiculous farce this 1998 film is. Julianne Moore is pretty funny with her Katharine Hepburn like speech. Other than that, the film is from absolute hunger as the Coen Brothers again are trying to explore the obnoxious things of life.Lebowski, Jeff Bridges, is confused with someone with the same last name, whose second much younger wife has been borrowing money all over town. When she disappears and a ransom note comes up, the wealthy Lebowski enlists the aid of Bridges to act as a go-between. Seems that Lebowski was mistaken for the other and the crooks urinated on his rug. To get even, Bridges takes the rug of the wealthier man as pay back.Of course, Lebowski and his sidekick, John Goodman, a Catholic who is divorced from a Jewish woman and has adopted Orthodox Judaism, by being a sabbath observer, feel the woman staged the kidnapping.The rest of this ridiculous film is devoted to crazy plot twists along the way.

In 1941 the motion picture academy selected 'How Green Was My Valley' as the best picture of the year and this is one person who wholeheartedly agreed with the academy's decision.This movie starring Orson Welles as the fictional Charles Foster Kane was not at all interesting, especially when it was supposedly based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. Had they spoken more about the Hearst Newspapers, his castle in San Francisco, and his affair with Marion Davies, we would have had a far better picture.The picture conveys Kane as an absolute tyrant with a whole host of people around his orbit. Everett Sloane was excellent as Bernstein.The part I liked best was when Kane thought that he would be elected governor and the disappointment that was etched on his face when this did not occur.Rosebud...",5,1,7,23 December 2007

Ricci's face shows her unhappiness and disturbance and ultimate betrayal of her lover.The film does suffer from clichés such as Wuornos's attempt to justify the killings. Raped at age 8 by her father's friend, she would be subjected to abuse by the father as well. When she is found guilty of the killings and sentenced to death, Wuornos screams that you're killing a raped girl. Does this life history excuse her from what she did?

His superb fluency in several languages, marked by his cruelty and evil facade, allowed him to give an Oscar-winning performance which was certainly well-deserved.Although writers of the film distorted history in their telling of this story, they deserve much credit for producing a what-have been motion picture.As the leader of the special unit, Brad Pitt was excellent with his southern drawl.This was a truly remarkable film.",9,1,2,5 August 2012

","***1/2 for viewing gambling as the root to all evil.Brandon knows how to pick sport winners so he is recruited by big-shot gambler Al Pacino to come to N.Y. and work for him.Brandon starts off as a Willie Stark, naive, smart and a regular guy. Pacino soon puts him through a metamorphosis of changing his name to John Anthony, and making him a general swinger-cigar smoking, with a drink in his hand kind of guy knowing full well how to use the f word. Pacino soon puts him on his cable station and John Anthony, with his football predictions and sly style, soon becomes a sensation. People will go along with his wagers and gamble heavily themselves.Naturally, we have the mob involved. When he does well, John is everyone's boy; when the tables start to turn mobster 'Armand Assante' shows how little he can regard human dignity and I'm putting that mildly.The picture though is a positive one. Showing that gambling is nothing more than suckers guessing who will win, it depicts when it's time to get out. This was one time you don't want to get out because of the usual outstanding performance of Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey, the guy who Pacino makes as John Anthony.A searing look into the world of gambling.

He receives fine support from Willem Dafoe. The latter plays a northern FBI agent in conflict with Hackman as no matter what the FBI attempts to do, they are thwarted every step of the way by a bigoted, disgusting town and local law enforcement officers up to their necks in corruption and murder.As the wife of a deputy sheriff, Frances McDormand is fabulous as an abused woman with a conscience.The film is terrific as it shows how the bigots attempt to justify their ways as appropriate to their religion.

","The film takes place in 1947 when Dodger General Manager Branche Rickey takes a big gamble by signing Jackie Robinson to a Dodger contract in major league baseball.While this is a very good film, I was somewhat disappointed by the performance of Chadwick Bosnan as Robinson. When the real Jackie Robinson spoke, it was as if pearls of wisdom descended from that mouth. His speech clearly showed the intellectual capacity he had amassed from graduating from UCLA. Bosnan shows none of that.As Rickey, Harrison Ford was outstanding and it is truly surprising that he doesn't appear on this year's Oscar nominee list for best supporting actor.The film is excellent because it shows how the Dodger players went from signing a petition against Robinson to where they coalesced around him. The shocking behavior of fans in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati are shown, and Philadelphia manager Ben Chapman comes off as a disgusting racist.A wonderful film depicting social upheaval in the United States.",10,0,2,8 February 2014

The story deals with the attempt of our CIA launching a covert action to free the 6 people in the embassy who had fled at the time of its take-over and were granted asylum in the Canadian Embassy.The plot involves a phony movie production of 'Argo,' a phony film which would be used to get the six people out of the country.Alan Arkin and John Goodman really provided comic relief by working with our government to create this false attempt at movie making so as to fool the Iranians.As the 6 prepare to leave, tension builds in some very grueling scenes, as they appear to run into roadblocks in their attempt to flee the country.",10,1,5,8 September 2013

","The film may be described as a good one due to the outstanding ensemble cast of actors in it.I found that the film is definitely liberal-slanted. Conservatives are depicted as bigoted idiots. Henry Fonda, the juror who swayed all eventually, has a liberal, creative mind. He is really able to come up with creative ideas that leads to the acquittal of the defendant. Fonda is the dream juror for every defense attorney, as well as a nightmare for prosecuting attorneys.Lee J. Cobb steals the film with an outstanding performance as a hateful juror who allows his personal problems with an alienated son to feel that the accused is guilty. Ditto for Jack Warden, who really switched his vote in order to get to that baseball game.When viewing E.G. Marshall's performance, I could not help think back about his acting in the television series-'The Defenders.' He is really the opposite hereEd Begley really spews out bigoted ideas that most of 'these people' aren't any good and think nothing of a life. We are constantly reminded about the downtrodden, the abused child, slum and poverty living in relation to crime and other factors. The film is really a good psychological-sociological drama if anything.It seems as though the violent thunderstorm signaled a break in the action. When the lights were put on, the fan worked. Why didn't someone in the court tell the jurors about the fan and the light? Especially, as it was a sweltering day.As the jury foreman, Martin Balsam is supposed to conduct the agenda in order. Instead, he really allows the other jurors to dominate.Wouldn't you love to see the reaction in court when the verdict was read? How did the accuse react? The judge?

The beast, really an enchanted prince, punished because of his inability to love, meets up with Belle's inventive father, who took a wrong turn. Luckily, his wrong turn sparked a picture right on the mark in all ways.Belle is pursued by the obnoxious, egotistical Gaston, who believes he is the Lord's gift among women. He may be handsome as they come but he exhibits an attitude and personality beyond the realm of human understanding.The late Jerry Orbach was the voice of Lumiere and you'll easily recognize the screeching voice of Wardrobe's Joanne Worley from 'Laugh In' Fame.The film is an absolute timeless treasure for all ages.

Going to a bar, he learns to pick up girls from Ryan Gosling, who sheds his usual tough-guy image in films and turns in a gem of a funny performance.It just becomes a story of coincidental love with the inappropriate people, such as your son's 8th grade English teacher-Marisa Tomei and Gosling unknowingly falling for Carell's 17 year old daughter.Everything seems to come to a favorable conclusion at Carell's son's graduation.

An admirable job is done to depict her as this, especially since she was the one who helped to wire German headquarters while working for the Dutch underground.

In many ways, he reminded me of the great star's performance in 'Hud.' Even the way he wore his cowboy hat was similar to that of Newman.The first part of the movie will be viewed by many as objectionable. It details how the 2 shepherds fall into a homosexual relationship which becomes a 'Same Time, Next Year' thing. The difference is that in the latter film, the couple could go on with their everyday lives. This picture depicts how their relationship, which was destined to go nowhere, ultimately ruins their lives.Ledger, in a low-voiced keyed performance, is terrific as the surviving partner of a relationship that ruined his marriage and leaves him alone at film's end. Jake Gylenhaal is wonderful as his counterpart. Strong-willed but realistic, he set an appropriate tone by his acting.'Brokeback Mountain' was the surprise Oscar loser for best picture. Even liberal Hollywood could not find itself in the end to vote for a homosexual based film. Instead, they chose the rather 'safe' film 'Crash,' which detailed racist problems in society.

As a drunk, daughter of a rich man who abandoned her, Ms. Laurie showed tremendous depth in a fine performance. Lonely, desperate for love, and a desire to be wanted, she depicted a memorable portrait of desperation.As a vicious hustler himself, George C. Scott turned in a powerhouse performance. How he and Jackie Gleason could have both been nominated for best supporting actor is beyond me. The nomination only belonged to Scott here.Eddie is finally shown as a man who can think about more than pool when tragedy strikes.The film is structured well. We have the pool sequence followed by a body of story development before finally returning to the game itself.Murray Hamilton and Myron McCormick both shine in brief performances, especially McCormick who tries to act in a father role to our hustler hero, but ultimately fails.",7,2,6,12 March 2006

The film, in my opinion, lacks direction and other characters are rather quite dull to say the least.For a gal who doesn't see ideal love, to up and marry someone else so suddenly was ridiculous to say the least.The ending is a real corker where our guy, on a job interview, meets a gal vying for the same position.

I was a little perplexed regarding the stepmother part of Allison Janney. When hearing the news of Page's pregnancy, she begins to exhibit religious fanaticism that we saw her do so well on a comedy level in 'Hairspray.' Suddenly, she falls into line and gives a truly compelling supporting performance.This is a lovely, emotionally paced film.",8,1,3,15 June 2008
Concussion," ***1/2
","Why wasn't Will Smith Oscar nominated for this very good film, a true story, where a doctor from Nigeria blows the whistle on the National Football League for covering up deaths of players who received concussions while playing and went on to severe headaches, loss of memory,dementia, Alzheimer's and ultimately suicide?Smith rises above the part of the Nigerian doctor who goes way above wonderful ethical and moral conduct to confront the NFL. Naturally, he faces a hostile sports organization fearing that they'll suffer at the box office, as well as fans who don't want to hear anything negative about their beloved sport.A wonderful picture and Will Smith really delivers here.",9,3,5,20 August 2016
X-Men," XMen-Mutants, Mutations Just Awful 1/2*
","Ridiculous Hugh Jackman vehicle. You can't laugh or cry. That's how bad this one is.Aren't Oscar winners Halle Berry and Anna Paquin able to find better material than this? I thought that Famke Johnson had promise. If she keeps up with trite like this, forget it. At the end, she flies in the air as if she is Mary Poppins. Miss Johnson, you are no Mary.This off-the-wall film deals with mutants who supposedly have been accepted by society. Nonetheless, a pharmaceutical concern had come up with a cure. Of course, the owner of the concern has a mutant for a son. Naturally, there is divisiveness in the mutant group. Part of the group, led by Patrick Stewart, want accommodation with the rest of the world. Stewart leads students in a gifted program. No gifted student would participate in a film as awful as this. Ian McKellen is up to his old tricks as the evil mutant with quite a ghastly crew.The special effects here are great. See a house torn up and the Golden Gate Bridge demolished as Alcatraz is invaded. Yet, the effects can't make up for bad script writing in this totally idiotic film. Is it any wonder why our youths react to the world they live in so violently when they view junk like this?",1,4,11,1 September 2007
Spider-Man 3," Spider Man 3: Caught in a Web of Disaster **1/2
","The film is adequate but in reality is a disappointment when compared to the previous two films.Tobey McGuire does have the opportunity to shed his nerd-like image when he is not the spider guy. Kirsten Dunst appears to be a lot older for the part and appears to have matured substantially, not to be in the category of McGuire's love interest.Rosemary Harris looks older and older. It is true that we're all aging, but Harris looks like Mrs. Weiss in 'The Holocaust.' ...And that was circa 1978.James Franco is fine as his third turn as the villain-still out to avenge his father's killing. It looks like he finally got the picture of what's going on but it's too late for him.There are a little too many plot twists here and the characters go from good to bad in record time.",5,0,2,7 June 2008
Match Point," Match Point Strikes A Right Balance ***1/2
","This is one of Woody Allen's best picture in years.With his usual philosophy of life and ethics, Allen is able to blend this film in with such classics as 'A Place in the Sun,' and 'Crimes and Misdemeanors.'He successfully recreates the dilemma of the emotions generated by the desire for upward mobility seen in the latter film with the ironic circumstances of the former. In addition, we have an Alfred Hitchcock ending which is just marvelous here.This is a story of a tennis player getting involved with a rich student's family and the resulting love affair and tragedy that occurs. Scarlet Johannsen is terrific as the American born woman who is disillusioned with her quest for an acting career and inability to find a mate. Dropped by the student, she begins an affair with the teacher who has married the student's sister.The aristocratic British family is shown as self-righteous, and alcoholic at best.A wonderful hard-hitting film on ethics and values. The visits of the murder victims will haunt you. That scene was poignantly done in depicting the dilemma and justification of the protagonist.",9,1,3,10 May 2006
Midnight in Paris," Midnight in Paris- Woody & His Philosophy of Life ***
","Woody Allen, as always, tries to find the true meaning of life in an upbeat way in this 2011 romantic comedy.Too bad that Allen wasn't younger, he could have easily played the part which was done quite well by Owen Wilson.A young writer and his girlfriend come to parents along with her parents, just before they are married. By a quirk of fate, Wilson is transported back to the 1920s and meets the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Salvadore Dali, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and so many others from that grand period.Everyone is marvelous here in depicting their famous people they are playing.While the '20s was certainly a golden era, the film shows what can happen when one of the people goes back to the 1890s.Reality always wins out and at least by film's end, Wilson realizes where he belongs and with whom he does not.",8,0,0,1 April 2012
A Bridge Too Far," A Bridge Too Far is Too Much **
","Even with an all-star cast and more, the film fails to deliver as we see vignettes describing the situation that the English, American and other allied troops are in with regard to trying to free bridges on their way to Germany in 1944.The battle scenes with the victims on the floor reminded me of those grave scenes in Atlanta in 1939's blockbuster, 'Gone With the Wind.' Everyone suffers.Even the old woman, whose house is taken as a refuge for the wounded, can't stand noise and even she falls victim to a bullet when attempting to run out of the house to get a 'taxi.'This attempt appeared to be a major blunder in fighting the war. Fortunately, we didn't have too much of those-otherwise, the outcome might have been different and I wouldn't be writing a review of this film right now.",4,5,15,13 July 2013
The Last Song," Last Song-The Melody Lingers On ****
","This is a perfect example of a clichÃ© movie that works so well. We have the usual themes of summer vacation and the son and daughter being sent to stay with the father at that time. Everyone is harboring some really difficult secrets.This is much more than a movie where the love of music allows Mylie Cyrus, and Greg Kinnear, who plays her father so well, to reconnect. It is a story of ultimate forgiveness and redemption after a series of mistakes.We even have the summer love, no doubt with a wealthy young man whose mother is snooty. Even the wealthy harbor a tragedy in their lives. No one gets away with everything.Kinnear is fabulous here, especially in his exit scenes. It is about the best role of his career, even better than his Oscar nominated role some years back. (As Good As It Gets?)Mylie Cyrus is just right for the part. She has the temperament for it and knows how to flow with the punches. Kudos to the young man who played her kid brother.This is a very good film. It captures the human heart and spirit. A tale of forgiveness, it is well worth viewing.",10,2,7,6 February 2011
Zodiac," Zodiac Offers Compelling Guessing Game ***1/2
","Absorbing, taut thriller about a serial killer in San Francisco and the resulting havoc that is caused.The film is a continuous guessing game of leads, innuendos, and much more as the state of California struggles with these bizarre killings which are spread over several years.The acting here is top notch with commanding performances by Mark Ruffalo, as a police inspector heading the investigation, Robert Downey Jr., a reporter, caught up in the mayhem and acting in a way that you could be suspicious of him as well. In addition, Jake Gyllenhaal is in fine form as a cartoonist working for the San Francisco chronicle who becomes obsessed with finding the guilty.There are plenty of questions, threats and intimidation along the way.While the ending offers no complete solution, this is a film that really gets you to think.",9,2,10,21 March 2007
Milk," Milk- This is the Real Thing-Far from Skimmed ***1/2
","An excellent Sean Penn's Oscar winning performance highlights this film.Ironically, this is the 2nd film in recent times that Penn falls victim to an assassin's bullet. He did it a few years ago in the disappointing remake of the 1949 classic 'All the King's Men.'In the original, Willie Stark learned to win by playing along with the system, in this film the reverse is true. You ultimately win by having the guts to stand up for your beliefs.We get an excellent dose of history here detailing the homophobic ways of American in the 1970s and early 1980s. Too many states were curbing the rights of Gay Americans.Penn totally captures the life of Harvey Milk by doing a wonderful job emulating his mannerisms. As far as social beliefs are concerned, Penn is way to the left politically so he probably had little difficulty digesting the script.What's all the fuss about the performance of James Brolin as assassin Dan White, a resigned town supervisor?'Milk' was an excellent film and should have been awarded the Oscar for best picture.",9,0,3,2 May 2009
The Prestige," The Prestige- Don't Need this Type of Honor 1/2*
","Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman have a field day torturing each other and ultimately all who see this nonsense.As two magicians, one's mistake led to the tragic death of Jackman's wife and the two spend the rest of the picture trying to outsmart the other.Interesting to see Daniel Davis show up in this film as a British judge. He received well deserved praise as Niles, the butler, in the television show 'The Nanny.' Apparently, the American Davis had such a good strong British accent on the show, he was thought of when this film was made.The film is hopelessly confusing as we go on. It is never properly explained who these Edison people were and what they were actually trying to do.The end is a joke and a mystifying one at that.Veteran pro Michael Caine is in this for the ride I guess. Don't run to see magic shows when you see this eerie film. Strange things are happening.",1,12,37,22 March 2007
Hotel Rwanda," Hotel Rwanda Meets Oscar Schindler and Raoul Wallenberg****
","Genocide is the focus at Hotel Rwanda where the former Belgian colony explodes into utter chaos. Minority groups are routinely referred to as cockroaches and are headed for extermination.It seems as if no one really cares about the fates of these poor miserable people trapped by fate.Don Cheadle, as the hotel manager, is absolutely brilliant in a worthy Oscar nominated performance. His compassion runs deep. Cold at first, he does undergo an Oscar Schindler-like change for the sake of humanity.A U.N. commission is sent in at first only to lead white people caught up in all this to safety. The scene where their bus leaves with a woman holding a dog in the back is poignant.There is plenty of corruption and despair.Will the U.N. rush in at the end and do an old western style cavalry saving of the civilians? It is well worth it to see this picture and find out.Cheadle's wife in the film is played with gusto by Sophie Okenado. Her best supporting Oscar nominated performance is worth to see, as she depicts a woman of desperation who screams at her husband when she and their children are allowed to flee but he opts to remain.",Null,1,2,8 February 2006
The Hateful Eight," *
","I just hated The Hateful 8 from when the movie begins and the plot unravels.The film is just awful at best and really disgusting the way Samuel L. Jackson reveals how he tortured the young man in the snowstorm with his private part. Don't we have any decency whatsoever left in our films of today? The vulgar description just leads to imagining the most vile picture ever.Jennifer Jason Leigh, usually a wonderful actress, is so distorted here in the beatings she takes as well as the shots and her fateful end.The violence is dominant here with just about everyone taking a bullet, even fat Minnie who asks how are big rear may be described so that she can answer yes in French.Positively, an awful film, not worth the price of electricity in viewing it.",1,10,18,31 December 2016
Dear John," Dear John-Very Wonderfully Yours ****
","What's wrong with this picture? What's with the critics. It was absolutely picture perfect, dealing with contemporary issues across the board.So many themes are wonderfully dealt with here. Abandonment, commitment, redemption are depicted beautifully in this story of love and the coming of age.We see young love; commitment to country after the 9/11 attack; maturity and life factors beyond our control.The cast is absolutely stellar.Richard Jenkins shows his merit as an actor as the depressed actor, diagnosed by a college student with autism, who survived loneliness by his coin collection. His son, an army man, proving that the army builds character and leads to maturity. Amanda Siegfried, as his college student lover, shows a rare maturity beyond her age, and both an unwillingness and later willingness to commit to someone in the face of absolute tragedy.This is a beautifully realized film.",9,1,1,6 December 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Stealing is Not for Me-Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid **1/2
","The problem with this film is a very common problem in motion pictures. We become too involved and sympathetic to those who are doing wrong.There is much comedy here but the fact remains that Butch and Sundance were robbers, and in the end, they wound up as many in that illegal profession do.Yes, it is true that there are some very funny lines. We are amused by the dedicated worker robbed by the duo two times. Announcing a hold up in Spanish with directions must have brought the house down.The audience must have also been enlightened by Paul Newman's acrobatic ability on the bicycle with and without Katharine Ross, who obviously took a much more mature role here after her 1967 smash 'The Graduate.' We really can't figure out Etta here. Did she really love both guys?B.J. Peaker's Oscar winner-Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head is wonderfully staged, but where is the rain?",6,1,2,2 December 2010
Crash," Crash Survives and Makes the Grade ***1/2
","This is not a film that will promote racial understanding but it certainly shows what can happen when we don't do this.'Crash' really refers to the cultural differences within the framework of a system that may very well be against us from our date of birth. There is redemption and miracles depicted here.The film is headed by an all-star cast. Matt Dillon, nominee for best supporting actor, steals the show as a racist cop who comes down to reality when the situation demands it. Otherwise, he is an out of control bigot, angry at the system for what it did to his father who practiced racial toleration and was victimized by reverse racism in his profession. Dillon has his moments in his emotional outbursts and could very well be walking down the aisle on March 5. On March 5, 2006 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences chose 'Crash' as the year's best picture. Thinking back, I saw a very small but important similarity to the great 1947 Oscar best picture winner, 'Gentleman's Agreement.' The two films show a similarity in that they tackle prejudice by hitting the nail right on the head.'Crash' will be a very important film as the years go on.There are other strong performances by Don Cheadle, as a savvy officer who, in neglecting a family problem, is blamed by his mother when tragedy strikes.I would have liked the Brendon Fraser and Sandra Bullock parts expanded. He is a D.A. and she is his wife. Their car is hijacked and he wants a black to be named in an important position for political purposes. Then, their parts seem to go limp.This is a film of racial and cultural misunderstanding well done.",7,2,5,5 February 2006
The Bodyguard," The Bodyguard- I'll Always Love this Picture ****
","Even with a weak acting performance by singer Whitney Houston, this is a fabulous film as it gives up everything: a wonderful plot, fine chemistry between Kevin Costner and Ms. Houston, the reality of finding love while on the job, and an Academy Award show never to be forgotten!The beautiful Oscar-winning song is sung here with perfection by Ms. Houston.As stated above, Houston's performance is lackluster through most of the film. It did pick up somewhat as the plot thickened. As for Costner, as the over-zealous agent, he was never better. What makes the film so good is the believable plot twists that are discovered. All does not seem to appear what it should be regarding a former agent as well as the woman who portrays Houston's sister and secretary. We have often heard of what happens when love blossoms in the work place and this film is no exception to that rule.",9,1,4,13 December 2009
Begin Again," ***
","The picture was somewhat hurt by the abrupt ending. We really don't know where the Knightley character is going when the film terminates.That being said, Mark Ruffalo is just wonderful as the music executive, down on his luck, who is fired from the firm he started. Meeting the singer Knightley at a bar begins a character study of the two as they forge a relationship which will eventually lead to success, or at least we hope it shall.Down on money, it is interesting to see how they form a band and make demonstrations of their music in various areas within the city.Nice to see Haile Steinfeld back in film as Ruffalo's daughter here after several years following her Oscar nominated turn in a remake of 'True Grit.'Katherine Keener, as Ruffalo's estranged wife, provides an interesting character study in rejection and ultimate return to Ruffalo's life when success is changed for the better. I would have liked to have seen her character more developed.",8,0,1,10 June 2015
The Book Thief," ***1/2
","A breath of humanity and human decency in the midst of mayhem in the 1930s Germany is realized in this excellent film.It is a tale of reawakening to what is good during times of evil.I would like to have seen Geoffrey Rush's character developed more as the anti-Nazi. He gives a terrific subdued performance as the adoptive father and Emily Watson, as his wife, shines as the strict adoptive mother who is yet caring and loving.While the history in a bit rushed- book burnings, we're at war with England, Hitler is about to enter Moscow by Nazi newspaper accounts and the ultimate bombing of German cities, this helps the story along, which attempts to show that compassion did exist during such a ruthless time in our history.",9,0,2,20 December 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Sweeney Todd- Well Worth the Cut ***1/2
",I shall have vengeance sings Sweeney. (Johnny Depp) He certainly tears into this role with a vengeance.How well he sings the music of Stephen Sondheim. The guy is an absolute natural and is equally matched by Helena Bonham Carter's terrific interpretation of Mrs. Lovett.This film reminds me of the 1968 Oscar winner 'Oliver!' due to the sets and how it brings out differentiation among the social classes of early England.The film also reminds us that revenge doesn't necessarily pay at all. What goes around comes around is so appropriately depicted here.The cast is just smashing with Alan Rickman and Sasha Baron Cohen giving excellent support in their respective roles.,9,0,2,4 April 2008
Blades of Glory," Blades of Glory is Idiotic 1/2*
",Horrendous film about 2 skaters who are suspended for life for fighting while on stage. They get around the law by skating in pairs.They run up against a vicious brother and sister team who use another system like Cinderella.The skating leaps are fun but the story line is inane. The brother-sister team will do anything to derail Will Ferrell and his partner from winning.Ferrell looks absolutely ridiculous for this film. His eyebrows are very dark along with his air. The tattoos all over him best describe what this nonsense is all about.,1,2,6,22 March 2008
Horrible Bosses," Horrible is Funny Here-Horrible Bosses ***
","Everyone in this life has had a boss that you could not stand. When 3 guys have bosses who make life unbearable, they decide to do something about it-that is, kill them. In the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock's 'Stranger on the Train,' they decide to kill each other's bosses so that nothing can be traced back to themOf course, fate intervenes and this plot will not become necessary. The film becomes one of some chase scenes and slap-stick comedy. The cast is very funny, especially Charlie Day, who is really the dimwit of the trio.Kevin Spacey is excellent as one of the tyrannical bosses and Jennifer Aniston is the female dentist from Hades.",7,0,2,18 April 2012
The Best Years of Our Lives," A Best Picture of My Life
","When I saw the title of this great Oscar winning film of 1946, I immediately thought of what our returning soldiers from the war had gone through. Who would ever guess that the title emanates from the likes of the character of Virginia Mayo, scolding her husband (a marvelous Dana Andrews.) She had the nerve to tell him that she wasted the best years of her life while waiting for his return. Actually, she didn't wait, she had Steve Cochran,in a very brief part, to wait the war out.Who can forget that scene when Frederic March returns home and is greeted by his family. Myrna Loy didn't have to say anything. The way she stood there was forever memorable.What did Dana Andrews have to do to win an Oscar? He was so good here as a returning GI but was denied a nomination. March was adequate and was rewarded with a best actor Oscar. I don't know why in a year, when Jimmy Stewart was up for It's A Wonderful Life, did March deserve the accolade.The movie was timely as the war had just ended. Other poignant scenes dealt with Harold Russell, who had lost his limbs during the war, dealing with his handicap.Unlike her undeserved Oscar for Mrs. Miniver, Teresa Wright, who died this year, was effective as March's daughter.",9,8,14,15 December 2005
The Town," The Town...It Takes A Village ***
","Taut thriller with Ben Affleck really mouthing off as the rest of the cast does. How much more profanity with the famous four letter word can we take? We realize we're dealing with some Boston low-life's, but let's use some discretion here.The tale is a good one as Affleck develops feelings for the bank employee briefly held hostage during one of his gang's bank robberies. It's a story of environment versus family ties with regard to Affleck and others. Pete Postlewaithe, who died recently, is memorable in his brief role as the gangster who tells Affleck the truth about his mother.This is a story of how someone evil tries to do something good by being with this woman.The end shooting chases were realistically done.",8,0,0,27 February 2011
Closer," Stay Far Away from Closer 0*
","A simply awful movie depicting sexual problems between two couples.If the writers of this disaster thought that they were emulating 1969's 'Bob&Carol&Ted&Alice', they must be sadly mistaken.The 4 people involved have sexual hangups. No question about that. Jude Law meets up with Natalie Portman when she hits by a cab. Jude has been seeing Julia Roberts, the latter is married to a dermatologist (Clive Owen) Some doctor! The filth that spews from his mouth is nauseating. He tells wife Roberts that he went to bed with a whore while on a N.Y.C. convention. Moments later, he says to her: 'Aren't we happy?'If this isn't crazy enough, Law uses Roberts' computer to bate Owen to come to a meeting where Roberts happens to be with a request for sex.Roberts and Owen are separated. Before he will sign the divorce decree, I'll give you a guess what he wants from Roberts. She complies.Law writes obituaries for the newspapers. He could have written one for this movie. Portman is a stripper. Owen throws money at her.Portman and Owen received supporting Golden Globe Awards for their respective performances. The Motion Picture academy happily saw otherwise.A disgusting, vulgar picture. Mike Nichols, you directed this mess. This was not 'The Graduate.'",1,7,14,11 March 2006
Suicide Squad," *
","It's almost suicide just to view this pathetic film from 2016. Will someone please tell me how accomplished Oscar winner Viola Davis subjected herself to such a miserable film.No, this is not exactly 1967's 'The Dirty Dozen,' where deviants are forced to fight the Nazis. This instead is right out of a comic book fancy with unimaginable villains in prison recruited to fight evil forces threatening to destroy the world.There is enough shooting for ten life-times. The special effects is about the only good thing in this mess of a film.My two favorite female deviants in the film were the psychiatrist who went astray due to her love for an inmate and the archaeologist who fell into the wrong underpass and had a negative life-altering experience.It becomes confusing when some of the deviants join with our crusaders.Evil was really never this bad.",1,2,4,8 July 2017
Shutter Island," Shut off Shutter Island **1/2
","Brooding plot with a wonderful atmosphere of heavy rain and doom mark this film.While the acting is good by all concerned, you just know from the eerie beginning that the tables shall be turned on the supposed investigators. Is Leo Di Caprio living in a dream world, living a tragic fantasy or being taken to the cleaners? I thought of the 1944 'Gas Light,' when Charles Boyer was trying to drive wife Ingrid Bergman insane.That's what this appeared like until reality set in.For a film regarding mental institutions, we see very little acting out on the part of the inmates.",6,2,5,1 August 2014
Capote," Capote: Boring Clunker **
","Philip Seymour Hoffman, ordinarily a tremendous actor, is downright dull in this film regarding Truman Capote's research for 'In Cold Blood.' In several ways the film reminded me of the 1951 classic 'A Place in the Sun.' While violence and death are occurring, we sing interactions among the wealthy in high society. Also, that farewell scene between Capote and the condemned killers was similar in nature to that of Elizabeth Taylor visiting a condemned Montgomery Clift.The differences were that the characters in 'Place' were more alive. The killers in 'Capote' were sadistic sickos who definitely got what they deserved. No question whatsoever here in the use of capital punishment.I was wondering if Capote used the title 'In Cold Blood' to describe what was actually done to the killers of the Clutter Family. He lies to one of the condemned murderers when they question him about the title of his book.Naturally, Capote had formed a homosexual bond with one of the killers. This conflicted him for he fully realized what this guy had done and the guy's own sister condemned him as well.Katherine Keener, who received a best supporting actress Oscar nomination, for Harper Lee is wasted in this film. Shown as a chain smoking writer, she is given little to do in the movie. Surely, the writer of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' deserved better than this. Then again, we deserved a better film as well.",5,2,6,7 April 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," Ocean's 13 - Drown It *
","Even an all-star cast can't save this misery of a movie.Danny Ocean is back with his pack ready for another caper. The original Ocean's 11 was lousy and believe me, this one is no better.I love Al Pacino's flaming red hair. At the beginning, I actually thought that Pacino's character would rival that in the wonderful Dick Tracy film. That role got him a supporting Oscar nomination. This picture he'd go absolutely nowhere. How about a little more excitement here such as terrorizing Elliott Gould?Carl Reiner looked like he was ready to attend a Brighton Beach outing in this film.Bernie Mac at the gambling table? He looked more like a super fool here. Ellen Barkin was just ridiculous in her role as Mr. Bank's (Pacino's) subordinate.By the way, what's going on here? Are our motley crew more interested in breaking the bank or getting that piece of jewelry. Even the alleged earthquake scene was dull. Old ladies in a nursing home could run out faster in their wheelchairs.A thoroughly ridiculous, poorly written film. Scrap it to the garbage dump.",1,7,12,7 February 2008
We Are Marshall," ***1/2
","The unspeakable biographical film traces a plane crash that wiped out an entire college football team, coaches, cheerleaders, parents and others,is well realized in the picture.Losing a coach that preached that winning is the most important objective, the college looks to suspend the program until they see the people in the town demonstrate for it to continue.Obviously, this is a daunting task in total rebuilding and Matthew McConaughey delivers a knockout performance, which should have been recognized by the Motion Picture Academy, as the bubbly new coach, recognizing the huge task that was before him, while stressing that coming to terms with what occurred and going on is more important than just winning. The only thing that I can say is that these films tend to become quite preachy and that is true in McConaughey's delivery.Still a very good film dealing with extremely difficult subject matter is to be treasured.",9,2,2,23 October 2015
The Grapes of Wrath," The Grapes of Wrath-Bitter But A Slice of Americana ****
","Tragedy of the dust bowl of the 1930s, the economic collapse and the resulting great depression all highlight this outstanding John Steinbeck book, which was made into a monumental motion picture.Very hard to believe that Henry Fonda's Tom Joad lost the Oscar that year to Jimmy Stewart in 'The Philadelphia Story.' Fonda gave a superb performance in the role of the Oakie son going with his family to California to start life anew.A year after her role as Aunt Pity Pat in the superb 'Gone With the Wind,' Jane Darwell won the best supporting actress award for her super sensitive but tough-minded Ma Joad. She depicted the pain felt by so many Americans during this difficult period, and won a well-deserved Oscar, despite the fact that her competition included Barbara O'Neil, ironically Scarlett O'Hara's mother in GWTW and the magnificent Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers in 'Rebecca.' What a difficult choice the Academy had.As for the 'Grapes of Wrath,' it lost the Oscar to 'Rebecca,' but picked up the director's award for John Ford. The latter had an understanding of America and he was rewarded for depicting 1930s landscape. The movie dealt with harsh reality and is a tribute to the men and women of the period.",10,1,3,5 June 2011

He is a red-neck in every sense of the word, coming from a tough minded father who gave new meaning to that term.Sienna Miller is terrific as his faithful and caring wife who could see trouble ahead.Cooper is good in the part of Chris Kyle, but Eddie Redmayne's characterization of an ALS victim deserved the Oscar gold.",9,11,14,6 October 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," This Devil Fashions Well ****
","Win or lose, Meryl Streep is sure to garner her 15th Oscar nomination for 'The Devil Wears Prada.'Not since Joan Crawford's performance in 'The Best of Everything,' have we encountered such a nasty bitch for a boss.Streep is just impossible to deal with. Cold, demanding, degrading and downright impossible are words not even adequate enough to describe her. She is a 1000% business woman. Amazing that she has married and has twin daughters! Where did she ever get the time for that?She hires a Northwestern graduate, Anne Hathaway, to be her second assistant. Miss Hathaway soon proves that she is adept at her job and starts to win favor with the hard-nosed Miranda. (Streep)Along the way, her dedication to her job leads her to a falling out with her friends and long-time boyfriend. Naturally, as part of her job, she begins to rub elbows with the biggest people of the fashion world.The film also deals very well with deceit and back-stabbing; unfortunately, so common in the business fashion world.The ending is well-timed and those who love fashion will particularly enjoy this.Along with Miss Streep, I wouldn't be surprised if Emily Blunt is nominated in the supporting category. She plays the first assistant to Miranda, a dedicated worker who thinks only of fashion week, that is, until she has a rude awakening.",9,0,1,13 December 2006
Forrest Gump," Delicious Box of Chocolates ****
","Oscar-winning film of 1994 with an amazing award winning performance by Tom Hanks. It's the story of a slow young man who just seems to be in the right place while monumental events are taking place in this nation's history.Hanks has never been better. His slowness is beautifully realized and then audiences know that he is far from the slow person that he is attempting to depict.Sally Field, as his mother, is equally superb and should have been rewarded with at least a supporting Oscar nomination. It was amazing that the Academy overlooked her brilliant performance.Gary Sinise's performance as the soldier who ultimately is crippled is also splendid.Life is certainly like a box of chocolates. You know what you're going to get. With 'Forrest Gump,' you will get the best of the best chocolates.",10,0,5,26 February 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Gone Baby Gone is Going...Going...Gone
","A story of deceit, and moral virtues marks this film.Amy Ryan is excellent as a very common vulgar woman whose illegitimate daughter is kidnapped. Morgan Freeman plays a police supervisor, who lost his own child in a kidnapping years before and is forced into retirement when the solution to the 'Ryan' kidnapping goes awry.There is plenty of corruption in the police department.The main fault with the film is the casting of Casey Affleck as a detective helping in the search for the kidnapped child. He evokes little emotion and besides, his speech is garbled.Liberals will adore this picture as it brings out the age old conflict of where a poorly raised child belongs- with her mother or outside the environment. We know this and there is nothing special when the Ryan character reverts back to her usual ways once her child is found.",Null,0,1,6 March 2008

The movie tries to show you that during difficult circumstances, one can persevere.That being said, the film is still a comedy in how these two officers go undercover to a high school to uncover a drug ring there. The results are most surprising, but in today's world anything goes.Ice Cube co-stars as a no nonsense head of their unit. Too much cursing is shown in this film.

Nevertheless, he was quite good as Howard Hughes.The film shows Hughes' life, complex as it was, totally absorbed in aviation and film making.Kate Blanchett, as Katharine Hepburn, was perfect. She really established a well authentic New England accent in playing Kate the Great. Her Oscar win was like a 5th trophy for the late Miss Hepburn herself.The film is very fast paced just like the life of Hughes himself. Tragically, the man was victimized by OCD, which invariably ruined his life.As the senator, Alan Alda received a well-deserved best supporting actor nomination. Tied to Hughes' competitor in aviation, he tried to ruin him only to have the tables turned on him. While the part was brief, Alda showed a crustiness that I never thought he was capable of. I thought I was viewing Melvyn Douglas when I saw him in his scenes-especially the luncheon scene with Hughes.An interesting biography, well-crafted by Martin Scorsese, who just can't seem to find Oscar gold.",9,1,2,16 January 2006

Every 4th word out of his mouth is the F-bomb word.Frances McDormand, a superb actress, has a really stupid part here and she looks like Carol Burnett in one of the latter's television movie spoofs.The plot is beyond ridiculous and how Brad Pitt allowed himself to be in this nonsense is beyond me. Fortunately, he takes a bullet earlier on, so he is soon out of the mix.Richard Jenkins is as dull as ever. This guy has no charisma whatsoever as we saw last year in his Oscar nominated performance.I shall not even comment on Clooney's performance simply because the film is so wretched.

All sorts of masks and disfigurement disguises are worn.This is basically a story of internal fighting within the organization and there is constant physical battling.

The film just proves that there is no honor among thieves.Charlize Theron, as beautiful as ever, portrays Sutherland's daughter. She joins in the plot to avenge her father.The film is full of exciting chase scenes. In fact, the last 20 minutes or so are all devoted to this.Evidently, the writer(s) was (were) Republicans.

","If it weren't so tragic and serious, I could see 'The Caine Mutiny' being a comedy in the tradition of 'Hogan's Heroes.'That being said, Humphrey Bogart gave a masterful performance as the mentally deranged leader of the ship. Makes you wonder how a person this ill could assume such an important position. Ask any of us who have served under various New York City principals and we can tell you why.Fred MacMurray was engaging as a heel, a part that would suit him even better, 6 years later, in the classic 'The Apartment.'Bogart's Oscar nomination was well deserved but the supporting nomination for Tom Tully was ridiculous. As would happen 6 years later, Fred Mac Murray was passed over in the supporting category again for 'The Apartment.'Bogart's in and out behavior was well done here. His distorted face and handling of his arms gave us a devastating performance of a commander who is in deep emotional trouble. We see all the signs- the emotional outbursts, asking for apologies, degrading subordinates by calling them all kinds of names, constant agitation, need for perfection, picking on the asinine so as to get a reputation as a solid leader, Bogart finally cracks on the witness stand just as Ida Lupino did in the 1942 classic, 'They Drive By Night.'E.G. Marshall seems to have made a career as an attorney. Did he ever go to law school and take the bar exam? Jose Ferrer is engaging as Barney Greenwald, the attorney for Van Johnson-accused of leading the mutiny against Captain Queeg. (Bogart.) During his outbursts, Queeg would certainly give you that queasy feeling. As for Ferrer, he even looks Jewish to match his name!I found the picture to be average, with a love story thrown in. Robert Francis, as a young idealistic officer, was quite effective as well as May Wynn.

The choice was ridiculous.The one shining spot of this horrible film was the supporting performance by Tom Hardy as the villain, who justified his evil ways by way of religion.This basically comes down to revenge and it's amazing that DiCaprio could ever survive the mauling by that bear to regain the stamina needed to track down Hardy, who had killed his son in the interim.Yes, the scenery is unusual but it best reflects the mood of the entire film.",4,4,7,22 October 2016

Frustrated by feeling that her father abandoned her, Mickey abandons her pursuits temporarily when her father's eyesight is becoming a major problem.The baseball scouts are an odd kind of entity, with each one trying to outdo the other in the baseball prospects along the way.This film is even more than about the game, it's a woman's discovery of why her father really left her, her falling in love, the hopes, aspirations and attitudes of prospective players, as well as their dreams.",9,2,4,1 June 2013

The best supporting actress winner spoke like she had marbles in her mouth. That combined with her southern drawl made her impossible to understand.Can't fathom that Kathy Baker recovered so quickly following the horrible massacre of her husband and sons. They ought to use Miss Baker as a grieving counselor in a public high school. Nice job of getting back to yourself quickly, Miss Baker, but it was inappropriate.Jude Law appeared to be able to survive anything in this grim civil war tale.

The girl has no chance whatsoever of succeeding in such a contest. Her older brother has taken a vow of silence. While on the trip to the pageant, it is determined that he is colorblind and therefore will not be allowed to fly. He goes ballistic before being calmed down by his sister.Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette play the couple in this hopeless film. Kinnear is terribly miscast. The part, if the picture had to be done, should have gone to Steve Martin. Collette's brother, a college professor, has attempted suicide over a failed homosexual relationship with another student. He has left the hospital to join the family. In addition to all this, Kinnear's foul-mouthed father has left a senior citizen group to live with the family. He has taken up heroin addiction in his dotage.While on the trip, grandpa (Alan Arkin) has the temerity to die in his sleep due to an apparent overdose but the family carts the body out of the hospital to get to California on time. To add to this pitiful nonsense, they are stopped by a state trooper who finds racy magazines but not the body.Finally arriving at the pageant, the young girl does a dance routine that shall we say is not appropriate. The family goes on stage to support her. The police are called and the family is set free on the promise that they never enter their daughter into another beauty contest in the state of California.Can you believe all this nonsense?

It would have only taken the likes of the equally magnificent 'The Sound of Music' to beat it out that year.With a phenomenal musical score played with lust and grandeur throughout the film, the movie is certainly one of historical significance. It depicts the phenomenon of the Communist Revolution and how Communists got themselves into the army to bring Russia further down and ultimate rebellion.Zhivago, well played by Omar Sharif, is a dreamer caught up in such a fiery time. Julie Christie, as his mistress, is wonderful here and this was quite a year for her as she copped the '65 best actress award for the rather undeserving 'Darling.'Rod Steiger and Tom Courtenay deliver powerful performances, especially Courtenay, as the protester driven to extremism when he is beaten up during an anti-Communist rally. Of the entire cast, only Courtenay received Oscar consideration in the supporting category and it was a shame that he lost to Martin Balsam in 'A Thousand Clowns.'With magnificent visual scenery and David Lean's masterful production, this great film remains a classic through the ages.",10,2,2,4 May 2011

","Nice seeing Will Estes, Jaime of television's Blue Bloods in a minor role in this film.I think that the film basically torpedoes itself with the constant barrage of firing. Naturally, the scenes are confined to the ships whether they be above or below the ground and this is always a disadvantage to film viewers.Matthew McConaughey plays the guy who was told by his superior that he isn't ready to head a naval ship only for the one to tell him this dies on board and Matt steps up to the helm. Notice those bulging eyes of his as he directs the men to follow his orders. Harvey Keitel plays one of the men on board who is fiercely loyal to McConaughey and urges the others to do so. Interesting to see how McConaughey tells the men that we're not running a democracy here and they're to do what he tells them to do. The film becomes essentially a cat and mouse game with the Americans over powering a Nazi submarine while attempting to get a valuable recorder used by the Germans to communicate with Berlin.",6,1,2,5 March 2016

We have an unleashing of rats and finally the man who did his dad in is killed by our hero.That's when the plot to this miserable film thickens. Turns out that the man who he killed was really his father! Naturally, as is the case with all these brotherhood related films, there has been treason within the group. It's leader, Morgan Freeman, had begun to pick out victims for his own selfish gain. When the real father discovered this, he was eliminated and Freeman chose the son to do this as he knew that the father would never shoot his own son.Despite non-stop action, the film is the perfect clinker.

Judgment at Nuremberg," Judged to Be Great
","A superb film in every aspect is the 1961 version of Judgment at Nuremberg. If only the motion picture academy would have 2 categories for musicals and dramas, this brilliant film would have certainly won in the latter category.An all-star cast is shown in the story of the trials that occurred following World War 11.We have Spencer Tracy, the head of the tribunal, playing the part with tremendous foresight. Max Schell, in an Oscar winning performance, is the defense attorney for the miserable judges who allowed their bigotry and loyalty to the Third Reich to get in the way of everything that is decent.Who can forget Burt Lancaster as one of the repenting judges? Richard Widmark plays the prosecuting attorney as if he were a holocaust victim. He was superb.Phenomenal in Oscar nominated supporting roles are Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland, Christian victims of the Nazi regime. Their testimony during the trial is chilling and shows what hate caught up in a society gone insane could produce.Marlene Dietrich, a real life refugee from Nazi Germany, is perfect as the wife of the executed Nazi army official. Knowing the wrongs that have occurred, she is nevertheless dismayed by the pictures of holocaust victims shown by the Widmark character at the trial.Stanley Kramer did a masterful job in directing a film that should be shown to students of the Holocaust and to all.",10,2,2,7 January 2006

In addition, the way that it is showed how the mother died some years after that tragedy was rather silly.

They seem to enter a time machine which propels them to Paris and other places so that they may commit mayhem.Those who investigate appear to be made absolute fools of. The plot twists are ridiculous, but that's what the whole money is essentially.",1,2,4,4 March 2014

","This film well depicts the study of racial prejudice and how best to combat it.Yes, Gandhi adhered to the practice of non-violence, but there were times, as shown in the film, that his followers didn't listen to him. This would cause him to fast.Ben Kingsley was excellent in the title role. You actually felt for him and would empathize with his pain and suffering along the way.The film shows the beginnings of the movement, demonstrations, fasts and possible redemption.How ironic that this man of peace took two bullets at the end of his life.The picture certainly depicts how miserable the British were. Whether it be in the case with India and with Israel, the British certainly had a lot of soul searching to contend with.",8,1,2,3 February 2008
Jackie," ***
","Natalie Portman gave a stunning performance of the late first lady and her diction was up to the Jacqueline Kennedy standards.The film revolves around an interview she gave with a reporter a week after the assassination. At the beginning of the interview, Jackie appears condescending and actually giving the reality that she was royalty.Wanting a funeral similar to that of Abe Lincoln, she changes her mind once killer Lee Harvey Oswald was murdered but quickly relents.While it is true that Kennedy loved the play Camelot, his life was much more than this fantasy. There were unfulfilled dreams and actions to take, especially in the field of civil rights.Jackie comes across as a chain-smoking lady and by the way, I didn't know that Robert Kennedy puffed away as well.The film is an interesting one where she has to come to grips with her husband's death so as to lead her children. Her confessions of wanting to be dead were quite shocking which she revealed to the priest.",8,0,0,29 August 2017
No Strings Attached," No Strings Attached- Cut the Nonsense **
","The problem with this 2011 film that I see is with the writing. Would you want a doctor-to-be such as Natalie Portman portrays in this film? She is a sex-driven character who has known the Ashton Kutcher character from childhood at certain interludes of their life. Imagine saying to Kutcher when they're young adults: Come with me tomorrow. Tomorrow is the place where she brings Kutcher to her father's funeral.Portman is almost churlish in her performance. She also has a dragging craggy-like voice which can become annoying at times. The lady is a whiner in every sense of the word.Kevin Kline, who portrays Kutcher's father in the film, has the best line at picture's end when he describes to his son, while hospitalized, how we fall in love.They call these things romantic comedy. To me, it's nothing more than romantic nonsense with 2 young adults determining that their relationship shall be for physical use only. The premise here is ridiculous.",4,1,2,8 January 2014
Enchanted," Enchanted is Everything and More ****
","This is a heartwarming tale. It's Cinderella revisited or better yet, Cinderella comes to modern day New York.Of course, we have a wonderfully wicked stepmother (Susan Sarandon) who can't take that her step son will marry a girl prettier than her. Enraged when he finds the love of his dreams, she dresses up as the old witch and throws the unsuspecting girl down a river leading her to Manhattan.It really becomes a riot when the prince, a queen's subordinate, a chipmunk and the Queen herself all follow her to New York.In N.Y. the animated characters come alive as our girl meets widower Patrick Dempsey with a 6 year old girl. He is ready to marry again to the lovely Idina Menzel.The merriment caused by the singing and dancing are wonderful. Everyone in the cast does so well. The ending where the wicked Queen gets her is just fabulous. You wonder why Menzel's part wasn't larger, but you come away with such a positive feeling after seeing this film for the young and adults as well.A truly wonderful imaginative idea in motion picture making. Cinderella and Snow White, you've gone modern. Congratulations.",10,2,3,17 August 2008
The Duchess," Duchess Needs More Duking Out **1/2
","Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes star in this period peace depicting the superiority of the male, who it is shown can immerse himself with other women openly but yet find it revolting when his wife basically does the same thing.No doubt about it. Ralph Fiennes is getting older. This is more of a supporting role for him, as evidenced by his supporting nomination for a Golden Globe award in the drama category. In the scenes that he is in, Fiennes is engaging. He still has that mean stare after all these years. Cold, calculated, brooding are the best words to describe his performance here.The picture is uneven at points where Knightley's mother rallies to the support of the Duke of Devonshire (Fiennes). I guess that's just the subordinate instinct that women felt in the 18th century that the writer was trying to depict. Another total about face is by the Duke's own lover in support of the Duchess when she has her illegitimate son by a rising politician who promises change. Sounds familiar, doesn't it?",5,1,4,30 December 2008
Dirty Dancing," Nothing Dirty About this Dancing ****
","A fabulous film capturing life in the Catskills for Jewish people years ago.Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey were perfectly cast as the lovers who meet by chance in the summer of 1963. Jennifer's doctor father, played to the hilt by Jerry Orbach, takes the family on a summer vacation and Grey is immediately attracted to dancer Swayze along with his group of dancers.Besides the terrific dancing and music, the acting is terrific. Yes, there is plenty of stereotyping but it's well worth it.Max, the owner of the hotel, played to perfection by Jack Weston, conveys the spirit that existed at these hotels in the 1950s and beyond.There are certainly exceptions to the usual stereotyping. The prospective doctor, who is a summer waiter, gets a girl into trouble and it is immediately assumed that the swinger Swayze is the father. Wait to you see who has committed all those robberies at the hotel. You'll laugh out loud.This is a rare gem of a film since it so beautifully captured the period of time as we discovered and evaluated our youth.You will want to dance up a storm when you see this one. Hard to believe that 20 years has gone by since the film was made. Jennifer Grey, daughter of Oscar winner Joel Grey, had such talent and potential What became of her?",9,0,0,22 February 2007

","A very disappointing film. Do you know why? As these films go on, the plot becomes extremely thin and all we get is high action. I know that the producers want to please the teens out there, but this is becoming ridiculous.Dominick Green is supposed to be interested in global warming and oil. In reality, he wants to create a drought. What does he want to do, control Poland Spring? This is never fully explained. Instead we get exciting chase scenes on roof tops, boat chases and airplane sequences. Enough is enough already.Imagine, James Bond becomes suspect here and at one point Judy Dench, as M, has him suspended. It's long overdue for Ms.Dench to withdraw from this role. Even Lois Maxwell knew when to get out. As for Daniel Craig, the man has a built in anger. He totally lacks the sex appeal of a Roger Moore or Sean Connery.

As Franco, a cocky killer, John Cassavetes received a well deserved supporting Oscar nomination. As a sadistic killer, who goes through religious rages against sex-driven women, Telly Savalas, who almost helped bungle the plot, deserved a nomination as well, but didn't get one.Lee Marvin is their faithful commander who asserts himself and then gets the guys into shape for this daring fete.The picture goes down some what as time is taken out for war games and the 12 men fooling Robert Ryan on two occasions. Ryan was always a difficult character to put it over on.The film goes back to its greatness when the guys land to destroy the castle and the German officials in it.

Gone with the Wind," A Wind for All times. ****
","The memorable 'Gone With the Wind' captures the south at its time of degradation.Margaret Mitchell's outstanding novel was made into a memorable Oscar winning film in 1939.Here we have the lovely Katie Scarlett O'Hara who will not allow the catastrophic civil war to wreck her life. We see her go through 3 husbands in record speed, while she still yearns for Ashley Wilkes, married to Melanie. (Olivia De Havilland) Despite fierce objections by Miss Mitchell, Leslie Howard was cast as Ashley. It was believed that Mitchell objected to Howard since the late actor was Jewish and she could not see him in that particular role. Whether anti-semitism played a part in her objection was unclear.Hattie McDaniel, was the beloved, sly mammy, whose strong will kept a family going despite one tragedy after another. Both McDaniel and DeHavilland were nominated for best supporting actress; the former would win.Scarlett loves Ashley but he is taken with Melanie. She marries his brother who dies of measles in the army. Frank, her 2nd husband, dies for her honor. Rhett, the real man of her dreams, becomes husband #3. Despite a wonderful life with him and bearing him a child, Scarlett can never stop thinking of her precious Mr. Wilkes.There are fireworks from the actors as well as the great civil war scenes. Atlanta destroyed; the wounded crying out in agony is memorable.We have carpetbaggers and scalawags ready to ravage an already ravaged south once the war ends.Melanie's death, in childbirth, makes it very convenient for Scarlett. She can now divorce Rhett and have Ashley. Surprise!!!! Ashley professes never loving Scarlett who runs through the fog back to Rhett. She now realizes that she always loved him. Confusing? The confusion is worth it thanks to Vivien Leigh's forever memorable performance as Scarlett. She would win a well deserved Oscar.As Rhett walks out on her, Scarlett declares that she will think about how to get him back tomorrow. This is one film to always think about. A way of life gone with the wind is an outstanding tribute to a way of life long gone but whose memories are forever etched in our minds.",10,3,6,7 February 2006

","I was terribly disappointed after seeing this Oscar winning film for 2007. Why did this picture win the best picture Oscar? It is absolutely horrendous. The Coen brothers seem to have a very warped view of life as we saw in FARGO and O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?If I were Javier Bardem, I would have been embarrassed to accept the award for best supporting actor for playing a totally depraved killer. His voice sounded as if he were on record and was placed on slow speed. While he portrays an absolute maniac, it was just horrible to see how he goes around with his gun blasting away at his victims.The film would have been much better had it been more about the drug deal going wrong. Instead, we see 2 guys after money and we know that the latter is the root of all evil.Tommy Lee Jones becomes a philosopher in the last scene of the film. Did anyone realize that the movie ended abruptly?This is a totally awful film, way too violent for my taste and others.",1,5,13,13 March 2008

The plot remains basically the same but the story line has to be updated to keep abreast of today's living standards.Meryl Streep is great here. Am surprised by her lovely singing voice. Ms. Streep is such a versatile actress. The close ups reveal a much older lady and after all, Streep is approaching 60 or so.The dancing is lively and full of life. The music by abba is rendered in a wonderful pulsating mood.Christine Baranski, though uglier than ever, is memorable here as well as the wonderful Julie Walters, they both sing and dance up a storm here.The guys taken on their roles as the possible fathers with precision. Skarsgaard is older looking, but shifty-eyed to a point. Colin Firth also shows versatility, but it is Brosnan who really captures his part as the guy who really loved the Streep character.This is really a very, very feel good movie.

His Brooklyn accent is memorable.The beginning of the film was rather boring as we get into the story. Nonetheless, the tragic death of our hero's parents was vividly told.As the film progresses, there are some nicely done action sequences but the story is rather uneven. Bring back the old television show. Christian Bale does an adequate job as our crime crusader.

","As far as I'm concerned, this was one of Woody Allen's best pictures in years.It deals with Romans and Americans caught up in a variety of situations in the eternal city.Not only is their hilarity but we can actually make sense out of how these people get away from these confronting situations to lead a normal life.From the plain couple who run into a prostitute, a movie actor and burglar, these situations shall only reinforce their love. To the hilarity of the Allen character discovering that his daughter's future father-in-law sings opera beautifully provided that he's in a shower and how that is handled is an utter joy to watch. How the young man discovers love with his girlfriend's best friend is amazing and how he reconciles with his girlfriend is pure Hollywood gold.Alec Baldwin serves as a mentor to Jesse Eisenberg. Judy Davis, who plays Allen's psychiatrist wife looks more and more like the late Geraldine Page. If ever they make Page's biography, she should definitely have the lead role.Roberto Benigni is as clever as ever as the common man whose opinions are suddenly valued. When his fleeting fame ends, he longs for it.This is a real crowd pleaser of a film.",10,1,5,7 July 2013

The plane scene was somewhat humorous. Annie had too many emotional hang-ups in the film.Would you want any of these dames to serve as your bridesmaids?

Polanski's win was a surprise since the conventional wisdom had Martin Scorsese for 'Gangs' winning the directing award as well.This tremendous holocaust film deals with the destruction of a family. The scene where a family had its wheelchair bound member tossed from a window and then shot as they ran was eerie and never to be forgotten.As a marvelous piano player, Brody captured the role with depth and a strong conviction. The scene where the family is placed on a train for their ultimate destiny can and must never be forgotten as well. From that point on, the focus of the picture becomes one of survival as Brody is able to elude the Nazi barbarians.A strong film in the tradition of 'Schindler's List.' Surely, a film for humanity.",10,0,2,20 March 2006

Murray Abraham ever get suckered into making such a colossal mess as this film?You would think that this film could have done without the constant narration and would have been on the scale of a Grand Hotel like atmosphere. Instead it concentrates on the relationship of a concierge and bell boy, with the former jailed for allegedly poisoning a frequent elderly guest. Most of it concerns itself with the bell boy aiding the concierge's escape from prison and the two constantly alluding the authorities.To me, this made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Abraham relates the story as he did when he played Salieri in Amadeus in 1984.",1,15,28,27 December 2014

They're just great at tormenting each other as we see in two major screaming scenes.The name April to me represents spring and the coming of flowers. April Wheeler as depicted by Kate Winslet is anything but that. She is a frustrated woman who thinks that by moving to Paris with Frank (DiCaprio) and their two children, they can start life anew. She defies the conventional times of the 1950s by saying that she will work in Paris while Frank gets the time to find himself. He loathes his job.Complications derail their plan when Frank is offered a promotion and April becomes pregnant.Something is terribly wrong when an emotionally disturbed man, the son of real estate person Kathy Bates, has the situation terribly correct. Is this a one flew over the cuckoo's nest syndrome? Bates looks like a typical elementary school principal of that period. She pretends to be friendly but inwardly harbors resentment towards the Wheelers.The film is basically devoid of the true meaning of life. In fact, it seems to attack that very idea.The fact remains that April Wheeler wouldn't attain happiness if she were in Paris, Shangri La or on the beach in Honolulu.Remember when Bogie said to Bergman in Casablanca, 'We always had Paris?' That great city is not the answer here.",6,1,1,28 December 2009

The other 4 nominees had to be far better.As a historian, I knew they were referring to the World War 1 conflict. The name of the war is never mentioned throughout the film. The only way you knew that this wasn't World War 11 was that Turkey was Germany's ally. In the Second World War Turkey was neutral.The best performance here was given by Anthony Quinn. At least, we knew where he stood. Peter O'Toole looked half-crazed throughout and Omar Sharif was ready to study politics for nearly 4 hours of this epic joke of a film. What really happened to Lawrence when he was tortured by the Turk. (Jose Ferrer in a one scene-stealer)Arthur Kennedy is the reporter in the film looking for the scoop. He was the reporter 2 years before in the far better 'Elmer Gantry.' An elderly Claude Rains plays a diplomat who really shows little emotion here.

Stone left nothing to chance in this 1991 film where conspiracy seems to be the focal point in just about everything regarding this grim part of American history.The acting is magnificent, whether it is from Kevin Costner as New Orleans Attorney Jim Garrison, who seems to uncover just about everything for his search for the truth in this matter.Joe Pesci is absolutely amazing as a person up to his neck in involvement in the killing.The court scenes are compelling and Stone takes no hostages with his theory that the assassination went way beyond Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby.",10,2,10,22 April 2014

Douglas had the intonation down perfectly on Liberace, the title character he played in this interesting biographical look at the great pianist.Douglas was ably assisted by Matt Damon, who turned in a masterful performance as Douglas's lover. The two of them really go at it in this film. Of course, the relationship cooled off significantly as the Damon's character goes down rather quickly.The film certainly showed Liberace for what he was- a nasty, vicious individual.

His relationship with his endearing wife who devoted her life to him and how circumstances and the need to move on ultimately affected them.Eddie Redmayne won a well deserved Oscar for playing the professor.

Of course, you wonder where the letters are being sent from. This is not one of those eerie beyond the graves film.We've come along way from movies since Susan Hayward, as Lillian Roth, reacted to the death of her fiancée by indulging in alcohol. Hilary Swank does a fine impression of Judy Garland's rendition of The Man that Got Away. The part with the fancy shoes from the famous Bette Davis scene of 'Now, Voyager' remains a mystery to me.Fine support by Kathy Bates, as her unhappy abandoned mother is given.Sending these letters is the ultimate sacrifice made by a dying beloved husband to get his wife used to her new fate and preparation for a life without him.

Fiennes portrayal is absolutely frightening as he steals each scene he is in in this remarkable film.The ending will tear at your heart as those saved place stones on Jewish graves.A positively memorable Holocaust film with memorable detail depicted.

","Al Pacino's mesmerizing performance highlights this action filled movie which is a true analysis of character.The film is 'Dog Day Afternoon.' Pacino, the bank robber, is doing this to pay for an operation for his homosexual lover. This is certainly a new one for perpetrating bank robberies. I wonder what Bonnie and Clyde would have said?The robbery goes awry and quickly becomes a hostage situation.Carol Kane, as one of the bank tellers, produces an hilarious line. With the robbery in progress, she gets a phone call from her boyfriend. The latter asks her how long this is going to take? There was such laughter when she said this by the audience, I did not hear Pacino's response.Plenty of foul language goes around especially by Charles Durning, who plays the police detective.John Cazale is a Pacino cohort who invariably winds up shot to death for his 'day's' work.An off-the-wall film that succeeds because of its dealings with human emotions, even when the latter are not deemed normal by society. Why has this great film become a cult legend? It deals with many societal problems and we see Pacino, the late Cazale and others as merely societal problems. Charles Durning, as the police officer, is magnificent here. He is brutal and yet can show some compassion as he learns about Sonny's twisted life. Pacino was totally memorable here and should have tied with Jack Nicholson for the best actor Oscar that year in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.' Ditto for the movie. Where was Durning's nomination in the supporting category? He was surely robbed here.",9,0,1,25 January 2006
School of Rock," New Methodology of Teaching Rocks ***
","If you're the conventional guy or gal, forget this picture. If you aren't, sit back and enjoy.A failed rocker goes into substitute teaching in an elite private school. He has a dream class and throws out the curriculum to teach them all about rock music including performing it.Forget the fact that it takes almost an hour into the film for the principal to show up to observe him. It's unrealistic and unorthodox, however, the picture works due to the performances of Jack Black and the kids that he molds. Joan Cusack has the right temperament of a principal who is ready to break out of her shell.Even goody-goody kids have hangups as the picture shows. Black must be given credit for his novel teaching ability bringing them out of their narrow-minded world.It's always great to learn new ways to motivate kids. Try this but not all the way. By the way, thanks to the parents for acting like parents, whether it be when they find out that Black is not a licensed teacher and when they see what he has accomplished.",8,1,1,13 May 2006
The Game," Don't Fool With this Game-The Game *
","This is far from any birthday present you would ever want to forget. A wealthy investment banker receives a present from his wayward brother, Sean Penn, that is most memorable.Michael Douglas is the banker who really undergoes a life altering experience being subjected to this game. His life is literally turned upside down with everyone around him in on this sham, and it becomes pretty terrifying at that.Douglas certainly thinks that he is the victim here and you soon realize why there were early scenes that showed his father's suicide. Could Douglas possibly wind up the same way? This is a creepy, eerie film that makes one think about the order of things. It's nothing more than a scary story with a surprise ending.",3,2,7,29 June 2013
Unknown," Unknown-What's Not Known About this Movie is A Problem **1/2
","Exciting and harrowing as the picture starts. Unfortunately, towards the end is goes steadily downhill. You stop and think: 'What's going on here?'We've seen pictures where people lose their identities, but in those films the victim is usually the good guy. What exactly is going on with Liam Neeson?The film is set in Berlin where one character states that we were once Nazis and now Communism has collapsed. That's basically the problem with this picture: Good plot, but too confusing, especially at the end.Go know that our cab driver gal was there not on purpose; but rather to pick up a fare. What a rude awakening for her.",6,0,1,24 December 2011
Gran Torino," Gran Torino- When Archie Bunker Goes to Extremes ***
","Clint Eastwood gives a powerful performance as a new widower, angered by life, and filled with prejudice. Living in a neighborhood that is certainly in transition, does not make the situation any better for Eastwood.The film is a good one as it shows Eastwood coming around eventually as he sees his oriental neighbors victimized by a violent Chinese gang in the neighborhood.Of course, the ending may be viewed as far too extreme by many. Yet, hasn't society itself created such situations?The film shows what extremism can lead to and should be applauded for that.",7,0,5,8 April 2010
The Hurt Locker," The Hurt Locker ** Ouch! **
","I was very disappointed with this 2008 Oscar winning film. The only reason why Kathryn Bigelow copped an Oscar for this movie is that the Academy finally wanted to give the directing award to a woman to show diversity.Most of the film details a bomb company walking around the dangerous streets trying to find bombs before the latter cause mass destruction. In most cases they were unsuccessful since everyone, children included, are potential bomb carriers.Amazed that the great actor Ralph Fiennes chose such a small part in this film.The film is quite short on plot. Naturally, there is the usual cohesiveness shown among the team. Action pictures generally ensue interest, but it's just not there with this rather dull film.",4,2,5,10 August 2012
The Longest Day," Longest Day-Oy Vey! **1/2
","Too lengthy for me.Good in the sense that it discusses the film according to the perspective of each of the allies and Germany.When Richard Beymer says at the end, 'I wonder who won,' I wanted to burst out laughing but would never do so because of the seriousness of the subject.Eddie Albert was too old to play a combat soldier. Nice to have seen him in a scene with Ray Danton. The two of them did not have a scene together in 1955's 'I'll Cry Tomorrow.'Hitler was depicted as the maniacal jackass that he was which was good. He literally was asleep at the wheel during the start of the invasion. Kurt Jurgens, as the German high-command soldier, depicted his part quite well.With an all-star cast, this could not be a study-of-character film and that's what very well may have hurt it. John Wayne and Robert Mitchum are at their patriotic best, but Henry Fonda, as Theodore Roosevelt's son misses the mark since his part is too brief.",6,3,8,30 May 2006
Meet Joe Black," Meet Joe Black- Guess Who Should Never Come to Dinner **1/2
","The acting in this film is quite good. Sir Anthony Hopkins stars as the well-respected businessman who has been notified by an angel of death that his time is coming. Brad Pitt, made to look wooden, especially earlier in the film, is also quite good.What I didn't like about the film was the morbid subject matter. No matter how much you talk about something else, you know invariably what is going to occur at the film's end.There is an interesting sidebar story how the associate of Hopkins, romantically involved with his daughter, who gives another excellent performance, is really undermining the boss. How Joe Black reveals himself to this stinker at the film's end is most interesting.To myself and others, the ending appeared to be a cop-out. I know that love prevails.",6,1,3,12 January 2013

Love will keep us together.",6,3,4,13 January 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Dorian Gray With A Life-Curious Case ****
","As far as I'm concerned, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' was more like Dorian Gray having a positive life.With his life in reverse, Brad Pitt, who played Benjamin, did an excellent job of conveying the problems of being born elderly but progressing through the years as a younger man. In the end, he has had a fulfilled life, but has to suffer the indignities of dementia as a young lad.The make-up artist for Mr. Pitt certainly deserved some sort of accolade, especially in his work with Pitt as an older man.A dying woman conveys the story to her daughter via a diary, and the young girl learns that Pitt was her father.There are other excellent performances by Cate Blanchett, as the woman who loved him dearly, and Taranji Henson, as the black woman who took him in and raised him in his 'elderly' years.",10,0,1,10 November 2012
Hidden Figures," ***
","One basic flaw of this otherwise good film was the way the characters were written. At the beginning, when their car breaks down, these 3 employees of NASA sound like they're coming out of 'Gone With the Wind,' and I expected to hear any minute that they're not burping babies.Octavia Spencer received a supporting Oscar nomination for her performance as the NASA expert in computers denied a supervisory position because of race. Supporting division? She was in nearly every scene.The film brought out that even NASA was a victim of racial bias with denying promotions, separate bathroom facilities and creating a hostile and totally separate of space for its African American employees.Jim Parsons, as a rather bigoted assistant to Kevin Costner, was very good and shows his versatility as an actor.Taranji P. Henson is marvelous as the calculator, a brilliant woman who had to run back and forth to use a segregated bathroom.Kevin Costner was appealing as the hard-nosed supervisor who becomes sympathetic to his brilliant African American employee. His removing the separate bathroom signs was memorable in the picture.Kirsten Dunst, as Mrs. Mitchell, succeeds in giving the feeling that she is a racist by her attitude, only to be accepting by film's end.",8,0,1,9 September 2017
Lincoln," Lincoln-A Man for Our Times ****
","Excellent production with Daniel Day-Lewis giving a stellar Oscar winning performance as our nation's 16th president.The film concerns itself with the battle of passing the 13th amendment to the constitution so that slavery could be abolished.The film well depicts Lincoln's attempts to twist the arms of Democrats. Patronage here is absolutely given a new meaning to.As Mary Todd Lincoln, Lincoln referred to her as Molly in the film, Sally Field was rather bland with the exception of her emotional outburst at the president when he acquiesces and allows his son Robert to join the army. He even threatens her in this wonderful scene with the insane asylum. It is to be noted that Mrs. Lincoln landed there following her husband's assassination and died there in 1901.A definite film of morality emphasizing the right thing to do with equality.As Thaddeus Stephens, Tommy Lee Jones was quite good noting that the amendment needed to be passed so as to sustain equality under the law. Note the prejudice shown by others if their resistance to passage. Not only were they fearful of a freed African-American race, they would see the emancipation of women among other things coming about.",10,1,2,28 September 2013
Children of Men," Below 0* For This Awful Movie
","If this is what movie making has come to, count me out. This is one of the worst pictures ever made. It's even worse that 200l: A Space Odyssey, 5 Card Stud, etc.What a stupid plot! Women are no longer pregnant. What would the church say about this? This isn't even about abortion.The very talented Clive Owen is in this mess and I extend his greatest sympathy to him. What's going on in 2027? The world has certainly lost its way in this monumental mess. Who is the father of this girl? What's going on here?How fortunate that Julianne Moore and veteran Michael Caine take bullets to finish them off.What is the message that the author is trying to convey here? The streets are beyond bombed out. Who is the enemy here? Who are the terrorists? I was hoping that Woody Allen would pop out and restore some sense into this nonsense.",1,9,34,11 May 2007
Million Dollar Baby," To Train or Not to Train ***
","Clint Eastwood directed this Oscar-winning film debating the above question. Should he or shouldn't he train a woman for fighting in the ring? Am sure he knew that he made the wrong decision.Hilary Swank, his Million Dollar Baby fighter, won an Oscar for her brutally realistic efforts as a fighting heroine whose career was cut tragically short at its height.After Eastwood finally decides to train her, the film deals with her successes. It's, unfortunately, too good to be true. There is another young woman hot on her heels and eventually, she throws a punch that knocks us all for a loop.Morgan Freeman, last year's best supporting actor, for his role as the trainer, moderates our story.With Swank fatally hurt, we turn our attention to moral issues of letting patients die. We also see the immoral behavior of her family, they showed themselves to be there only for the buck.If Russell Crowe is this year's 'Cinderella Man,' Miss Swank is certainly our damsel in distress. Eastwood's dilemma, after his ill-fated decision to train Swank, is whether or not to pull the plug. He consults a priest just before he does what he felt is morally right. I cannot fathom that the father would justify this. Am sure he consulted with him on this grave issue of the day, euthanasia.",8,1,1,1 February 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Mood of the 1950s Well Caught in Film ***
","Excellent film editing highlights 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' I haven't seen such good splicing of film since Woody Allen's 'Zelig.'In reality, Joe McCarthy could have been up for best supporting actor. That really isn't saying much because the acting here is just fair. At times, there appears to be too many guys in the newsroom puffing away on cigarettes. The American Cancer Society should have put out a warning before the film began. That would have been appropriate.This film is really a documentary. However, it does adequately capture the period of the 1950s when Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wisc.) led a cause of terrorism in this country and civil liberties just about ceased to exist. Edward R. Murrow, a brilliant reporter, stood up to him. We see Murrow taken to task by Frank Langella's Bill Paley.Jeff Daniels, who looks like he gained 40 pounds for his role as Sig, identifies a couple (Robert Downey and Patricia Clarkson) as being married. That's against CBS policy. How ironic that they go after McCarthy but yet have this archaic rule against employees being married. The usual excellent Clarkson seems out of touch in the role. She just seems to mouth her words.David Strathairn does well in the role of Edward R. Murrow. He adeptly captures Murrow in his crusade for fairness in treatment of individuals as well as civil liberties. It is also hoped that Strathairn went for chest x-rays at the end of filming of this picture. He will probably need follow up x-rays yearly following all that Murrow-like smoking.McCarthy was evil in every sense of the word. Just dare to criticize him and you'd incur his wrath. He even equates Murrow with being a member of the I.W.W.The movie never explains why McCarthy had to leave a meeting involving the Moss woman accused of being a Communist. What happened to this lady?George Clooney, who directed this film, deserves credit for tackling the McCarthy issue head on.",Null,1,2,15 March 2006
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," The Boy in Striped Pajamis is Gripping ****
","In viewing this excellent film, I was reminded of the television mini-series, 'The Holocaust' because of the similarities of the parents. The mother again is an ambitious person who is annoyed that Jews are working in the house and the father is a silently ruthless character, totally caught up in the mayhem of Hitler's Germany.Ambitious, he is promoted and will be the good German in carrying out the execution of the millions of innocents.The child, by his eyes, is immediately depicted as a young innocent, full of life as he and his pals meander through the streets of Berlin.For sure, there was no exit for the victims in striped pajamas.",9,2,4,22 June 2009
The Imitation Game," ***1/2
","The film certainly shows a negative view of British attitude towards homosexuality in the 1950s. Once you were found out, you were literally blacklisted, shunned and imprisoned.The film deals with the math professor who worked for the government during the war and brilliantly helped to decode a Nazi Enigma Code that would allow for the allies to react before a Nazi attack.Benedict Cumberbatch is quite good as the professor. He is essentially afraid of life and that's why he is unable to get along at first with his assistants. Of course, he is also trying to hide his sexual preference. His homosexual performance reminded me of David Niven's Oscar winning performance as a homosexual fearing life as well.",9,1,3,11 April 2015
The Last Emperor," A Last Tango in China? Last Emperor ***1/2
","If only they had begun this picture without the first half-hour to 40 minutes. As a young child, the picture is not the greatest. We don't have to see the feces left by his royal highness at 3.The picture comes alive when our little emperor attains adulthood and things begin to happen in history. His collusion with the Japanese government sets off quite a life. John Lone, as the adult emperor, gives a very compelling performance, as does his neglected wife, the unhappy Joan Chen.His life in a Chinese Communist prison after the wall is well done. We see an emperor reduced to humiliation in cleaning toilets and living a very hard life following a 10 year confinement.The picture well shows the Chinese cultural aspects around 1903 and the period of the Kuomintang circa 1911. In retaining the title of emperor, Piu (Lone) allowed himself to be a mere puppet of the Japanese, and when he realized this, it was far too late to do anything.",9,0,0,19 March 2011
Here Comes the Boom," Here Comes the Broom Is A Great Film Sweep ****
","This is essentially a comic version of Mr. Holland's Opus and highlights the fact that schools are being cut funds for the arts and music.Mr. James essentially plays a burned out high school biology teacher who finds his way when a colleague, Henry Winkler's position is threatened by budgetary cutbacks.To save the job of his colleague, Voss (James) resorts to a career in fighting and wrestling and actually succeeds.Surprisingly, I correctly guessed that there would be an embezzlement of funds. I even knew who the embezzler would be.The film is funny, inspiring and a joy to watch.",10,2,3,10 August 2013
The Adjustment Bureau," Adjustment Bureau-You Have to Be Kidding 0*
","Best part of this dreadful film was the ending credits. At least, you knew by then that you were finished with it providing you hadn't walked out of the theater during its run.Who exactly cares what forces are preventing a politician from connecting with a ballerina. The entire premise here is absolutely ridiculous. Had the ballerina been a spy, that would have been somewhat more interesting. Instead, we have a bunch of guys running around with hats on trying to prevent this liaison. It's never clear why these two shouldn't be together and as the film goes on, you couldn't care less.The best line of this miserable picture is when Matt Damon is warned to be on guard with anyone having a hat on, including a Jewish skull cap-'Yarmulke.' Is this for real?",1,1,3,24 December 2011
World Trade Center," World Trade Center-Film that Had to Be Made Succeeds ****
","Outstanding Oliver Stone film dealing with the disaster of all times in the U.S.- September 11, 2001.The film basically deals with 2 police officers who are trapped in the rubble of the Trade Center. It deals with their thoughts as they try to keep each other from falling into a permanent sleep. While this is going on, we witness what their wives and respective families are going through.Nicolas Cage is excellent as the trapped police sergeant.This is far more than the usual disaster film. It deals with the human spirit for survival at a time of national disaster. Well made, it deserves the highest rating.",10,2,5,16 December 2006
Prisoners," This Film Takes No Prisoners ***1/2
","A fine cast is the inspiration for this 2013 engrossing film where 2 little friends are kidnapped and the extremely distraught father of one of them, Hugh Jackman in a fine performance, tragically goes way beyond what someone should do in this situation with much tragedy resulting.Maria Bello is his distraught wife and Terrence Howard and Viola Davis add to the drama as the other parents. Jake Gyllenhaal is the hard-nosed detective who is always able to crack cases but is bewildered by this one.Melissa Leo has some scene stealing scenes as the aunt of the accused.The film shows Jackman's deterioration into lunacy as he kidnaps the man he feels responsible for what has occurred. Howard and Davis are reluctant participants and the ending is eerie but purely Alfred Hitchcock-like.",9,2,4,10 May 2014
The Dark Knight," Dark Knight-Joker and Others Go Wild ***
","The film is good but is very much over-rated. The Daily News rated this movie *****. It is rather a *** as I shall try to explain.The acting is top-notch, especially Heath Ledger as the Joker and Aaron Eckhart, amazingly good as Harvey Dent, D.A.This is one film that is rare since good does not triumph over evil. Dent's transformation is magnificently realized. It just shows us what situations can lead someone so pious to go so wrong.The film is action packed. The special effects are marvelously arranged.As far as the Oscars for this year go, an argument can be made that Ledger's performance should be in the supporting category as well as Eckhart. Gary Oldham,as Gordon, should also be in the running for a supporting Oscar as well as Maggie Gyllenhaal, who has really shown a depth of maturity here in a breakout performance.My lone argument with this film is the last-half hour. Once the Gyllenhaal character is killed off, the film does go a bit down-hill. It becomes confusing at this point. Confusion we don't need as we wish to study the change in dimension depicted by Dent. That being said, the picture is one of a rare quality. A thin line is drawn between good and evil here and we wonder where we can go from here as the credits roll.",7,3,15,6 August 2008
Everest," **
","Bored out of my mind best describes my feelings towards this film.O.E. Rolvaag, who wrote 'Giants in the Earth,' would have had a field day with this film when he spoke about the vicissitudes of nature. What these climbers of Mt. Everest had to endure, but of course we may always say, who told them to go climb the mountain to begin with?The movie seems to come down to the old Irwin Allen disaster films of the 1970s. We get sympathy when we hear the pregnant wife speaking to her dying husband on the phone. Sure this evokes many a tear, but it's too late for this ultimate flop of any disaster film made. The performances are satisfactory; one such climber can't stop coughing and pulmonary edema is discussed. If you cough like that, don't go climbing. Adequate oxygen was given to the climbers but the film lacked it. I was ready to start singing from The Sound of Music-climb every mountain,etc.",4,0,1,3 July 2016
Annie Hall," I'm Not With the In Crowd- Annie Hall Takes A Fall *
","I was in the minority when I saw 1977's Oscar winner for best picture. I just didn't like. When it was on last night, I decided to give it a second chance. After all, it's 29 years since I saw it. Guess what? This time I hated it.To begin with, I am tired of Woody Allen's attempt to philosophize life with his relationship with women and the fact that he is a self-deprecating Jew. He has constantly knocked the latter in many of his films. This is not appreciated.In this film, he surprisingly knocks New York. He goes to California but that's not for him either. Basically speaking Mr. Allen, what is for you?The plot here is weigh too thin. Allen plays the usual jerk in search of meaning for his life. Along the way, he meets Carol Kane at a Stevenson rally. He claims that what he wants to do with women is what Eisenhower has been doing to the country for 8 years. By the way, no one corrected the fact that Ike was not president for 2 terms when Stevenson ran against him. There are term limits since 1951 Woody!The film is tedious and often full of clichés. How many times must we be remembered what Jews are thought of by mid-westerners?I can't fathom how this stinker of a movie was given the Oscar for best picture. 'The Turning Point,' as well as 'Star Wars,' and 'Julia,' along with 'The Goodbye Girl' were far superior films. Diane Keaton acted like a typical mid-west 'shiksa.' Her hats and clothing were outrageous. She did sing nicely. Nonetheless, Marsha Mason ('The Goodbye Girl') and Shirley MacLaine or Anne Bancroft were far better in 'The Turning Point.'For my part, 'Annie Hall' takes a mighty fall here. Allen suffers from going aimlessly through life. He is afraid to take a chance. Too bad that he did with this film.",3,13,30,4 October 2006
Blood Diamond," Blood Diamond- They Are Not A Gal's Best Friend **1/2
","An overly violent film dealing with diamond smuggling in Africa. Sierra Leone is where the action is at.In a rather stunning performance, Leonardo Di Caprio portrays a soldier of smuggling who gets involved with Solomon (a fine performance by Djimon Hounsou. The latter's son has been kidnapped by a rebel gang. They have converted captured children into robot-like killers. Don't mess with these dudes. Even Fagin's band of thieves would fear them.Jennifer Connelly plays a photo-journalist caught up in the revolutionary violence.Nothing is spared from the viewer in recreating the bloody, gory scenes.Somewhere along the way you get confused regarding who the good guys are in comparison to the bad ones. Naturally, Danny Archer (Di Caprio) develops a bond with Solomon similar to the running of 'The Defiant Ones' Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis of that classic 1958 film. The ending scene is similar to Gary Cooper's 'For Whom the Bell Tolls.'",6,1,4,20 March 2007

","Benjamin just got his BA and his unsure about the future.He decides to take the summer off and chill by himself.At his welcoming home party, he is seduced by Mrs. Robinson, so memorably played by the recently departed Anne Bancroft.Dustin Hoffman skyrocketed to fame in the part of Ben.The film really depicts the moral decay of the 1960s.With the affair over between the two, Ben falls for Elaine, played beautifully by Katharine Ross. When Mama Robinson finds out, she will do anything to end the relationship including having Elaine marry as quickly as possible.The hotel scenes with Bancroft and Hoffman can never be forgotten. Doesn't Ben know he needs a key to the room?The hotel guests are amazed as shown by the brief cameos of veteran lady comics Alice Ghostley and the late Marion Lorne.Mike Nichols had a field day directing this hilarious tale, where a memorable wedding scene or should I say wedding break-up scene ensues.You'll graduate onto the fast track after viewing this great, great movie. ****.",10,0,0,6 January 2006
Pride & Prejudice," Pride and Prejudice-Pardon My Bias **
","Jane Austen's novel continues to be a bore when it's transferred to the screen. Despite the great 1940 cast of Greer Garson and Edna Mae Oliver, the film didn't exactly catch fire and the same is true for this 2005 remake.Elizabeth is a highly intelligent girl. Her parents are played well by Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn. The latter should be used if ever they make the life-story of Sara Allgood. She is in fine form as the doting mother who wants to see her daughters married off into wealth and happiness. Allgood? She ought to be the Irish answer to the Jewish mother.Keira Knightley is beautiful and gives a restrained Oscar nominated performance as the eldest daughter. She meets up with Mr. Darcy, a brooding character, who is both angry and frustrated with life in general. His nature is to almost cause misery for the family until things are straightened out by explanation and he emerges as not such a bad Joe after all.In her brief role as Darcy'd aunt, Dame Judi Dench nearly steals the picture with her vicious performance as a wealthy dowager, who looks down on the family and tries to prevent Elizabeth marrying Darcy. Dench has made quite a success in brief screen performances as she did in her supporting Oscar win for 'Shakespeare in Love.'The cinematography and set decorations are elegant and quite in order for the period of history they represent.The problem here is with the writing. We can't see all at once why Darcy is such a brooding character. His emergence as a person is also not adequately explained.",5,2,6,20 January 2007
Singin' in the Rain," Great to Sing in the Rain ****
","Supposedly, the best musical ever made did not win the Golden Globe Award of 1952 for best musical or comedy. That honor went to 'With A Song in My Heart,' a musical drama based on the life of singer Jane Froman.Nevertheless, 'Singin' in the Rain' deals with the advent of talking pictures and its ramifications on the silent stars of that time. We know that actor John Gilbert, a matinée idol of the silents, had his career ruined when talkies came in.Such shall be the fate of Lena LaMonte, hilariously played by the late Jean Hagen in a well-deserved performance which landed her a best supporting actress nomination.Our hero, Gene Kelly, plays opposite. Lena. To say that he despises her is to put it mildly. Gene really loves Debbie Reynolds who he meets in a very funny scene in this film.Donald O'Connor shines in this film. His rendition of 'Make Me Laugh,' while he literally walks on walls is memorable and terrific. The guy was a real class act.The problem is what to do with Lena? Her scratchy voice reminded me so much of Judy Holliday in her award winning 'Born Yesterday.' The scene where it is shown that Debbie has been singing for Lena is a riot. Humiliated, Lena runs off stage; hopefully, never to be heard from again. Let's make sure that this movie is always heard from again.",10,0,1,17 January 2006

He literally turns into a Rambo in dealing with the kidnappers of his daughter.The film has plenty of action and is well paced in the tradition of the James Bond films.",8,1,2,5 December 2009
Chariots of Fire," A Score for Music and Athletics: A Major Disappointment **1/2
","Score not so good for the Oscar winning film 'Chariots of Fire.' This refers to the movie itself. While Vangelis' Oscar winning musical score is magnificent, the picture falls flat due to a very weak plot line.The film basically deals with the 1924 Olympics and two competitors- a Christian and Jewish gentleman. Other than this, the plot was devoid of human understanding.On the way to an undeserved best picture award, the film was voted best for costumes. What costumes? You basically see a bunch of guys running around in their underwear.Always wondered what director Hugh Hudson was trying to depict. Give me an old fashioned story anytime. The old fashioned theme was there, but where was the beef?Warren Beatty won the Oscar for directing 'Reds.' He should have been called to the podium again to accept the award in the best picture category as well.",5,6,16,2 March 2006
The Artist," The Artist-In Honor of Thespians Felled By Sound ***
","The story is definitely a tribute to the likes of John Gilbert and other thespians, who with the coming of sound in films by 1927, lost their status.Mr. DuJardin's performance evokes such emotion which was probably most typical for the period. The showing of auctioning off his possessions and attempted suicide were most probable for the period.It also showed the love of one woman who stuck by him and saved him during this difficult time. It also showed that the way back to success was by dancing and singing.John Cromwell co-stars as the dedicated butler and there is a very good silent performance by John Goodman as the director, hard to the core, but nonetheless warned by his lover to take him back.The picture was probably average and for the most part,it didn't really deserve the best picture of the year Oscar. That honor should certainly have gone to 'The Help.'",7,0,2,7 June 2012

He realizes that this would be a great way to bring his people together along racial lines.While he is certainly entitled to his beliefs, how can you concentrate solely on this soccer issue and let important affairs of state become relatively secondary in nature. Investments and other concerns are merely glossed over.Morgan Freeman gives a very stilted performance as the South African leader. He is matched here by Matt Damon, as the leader of the team. I am not at all surprised that Freeman failed to capture last year's Oscar for best actor.The last part of the film is entirely devoted to the match for the World Cup.

","Had this musical won the Oscar for best picture of the year, there would have been an outcry far greater than when An American in Paris won in 1951. Both these musicals suffered from a complete lack of plot.The first 90 minutes of this film is a complete waste. Gosling and Stone even killed the Oscar winning song when they sang it. Their dancing was no Fred and Ginger either.The story might have taken off once they attained success but their careers would separate them.The film by itself could put you in la-la land. This was a real sleeper of major proportions. The Academy must have been in la-la land when they were voting Stone as best actress and other awards. Warren Beatty, you're certainly vindicated for naming the wrong film, this one, as the best picture. Film needs to be put asleep.",3,2,5,16 September 2017
Life Is Beautiful," Life Can Certainly Be Beautiful ****
","A positive outlook on life during such adversity, this is the central theme of the excellent holocaust film 'Life is Beautiful.'Roberto Benigni was voted best actor by the Motion Picture Academy for his portrayal of a Jewish man, who when imprisoned by the Germans during World War 11, tried desperately to rid his young child of fears by making a game out of the holocaust.The film begins with the very funny courtship of Benigni and his wife, who is not Jewish.Horst Buccholz, so young and charming in 'Fanny' appears as an Italian army official. They years have matured Buccholz. It was sad reading of his passing a few years after this marvelous film came out.The scenery is breath taking and Benigni alternates his feelings in a terrific comedy-drama performance.Just as liberation appears to be imminent, Benigni is shot by the Germans. Unaware of his father's death, the son will carry on in his tradition. His ride on the tank will bring a tear to your eyes.A moving and endearing film, not to be missed.",10,3,9,15 January 2006
Woman in Gold," ****
","I wholeheartedly agree that this magnificent film is certainly a work of art.The story of looted art treasures by the Nazis during their rampage of Europe is outstanding to watch, especially by the performance of Dame Helen Mirren, as an older woman who discovers that the family art treasures are in an Austrian museum.Forced to flee the country with her young husband, she has totally assimilated into American life and even refuses to speak German.Ryan Reynolds, as her attorney, is also wonderful here. The film depicts the ups and downs of their lawsuit and shows Mirren ready to throw in the towel at times, but a certain call for justice brings her back into the fold, willing to take on the ruthless beasts who killed her family and literally stole their art treasures.The ending scene where a victorious Mirren goes back in time, at her present age but to her wedding as a young girl, was most poignant.",10,1,3,8 June 2016
Invincible," Cliché Scores A Touchdown-Invincible ***
","Mark Wahlberg gives a splendid performance as a former teacher and bartender who gets the chance of a life to play professional football with the Philadelphia Eagles.The trouble with this film is that is full of clichés. The team that has to have heart and soul. A brooding young man whose wife walks out on him and takes all the furniture as well. This same young man who is affected by teacher budget cuts with a hard-working class father whose wife has died following a lengthy illness.Greg Kinnear gives ample support as the coach who has a positive feeling about Wahlberg. (Vincent P) Despite early team failures, he keeps him on the team. We see what life is like in the training camps and how Wahlberg has heart to stay on the team and then take abuse from team mates. When Kinnear gives his rousing locker room speeches, I thought of Pat O'Brien asking his team to win this one for The Gipper.Yet, with all these clichés, the film is nicely done and is a tribute to the idea that if you persevere, you can succeed.",7,4,7,11 June 2007
Reservoir Dogs," What's A Quentin Tarrantino Film Without Violence? ***
","The film again proves the adage that there is absolutely no honor among thieves.With an ensemble excellent all-male cast, the film is an anatomy of a jewelry heist gone wrong and flashbacks are excellently used here as we learn who these guys are who planned and executed this robbery.There is always the idea that there was an informant among them when things began to go wrong.The language is quite salty, but appropriate for the needs of this violent film.Harvey Keitel,Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth and others create the harrowing experience of this film.",Null,0,2,31 July 2011
The Great Raid," Great Raid Does Justice to the Big Screen ***
",Very good telling of a raid led to free American prisoners of war in the Philippines at the end of World War 11.The Japanese are depicted for their savage treatment of American prisoners. We see random shootings and other atrocities committed by a military induced society.The characters are not given the opportunity to develop since this is wartime.The ending sequence showing liberation pictures is heartwarming and a credit to the human spirit.We salute those who sacrificed so much so that others could enjoy freedom.,7,1,2,7 June 2006
Pretty Woman," Pretty Woman is Really Pretty Good ***1/2
","Julia Roberts earned a well deserved Oscar nomination for her role as a prostitute hired by a businessman to escort him for a week. Richard Gere does extremely well in the part of the guy, who needs an escort, but finds true love instead.Roberts does well as a woman who must rise to the occasion when she is hired as the escort. The film is really a Cinderella story of an underprivileged wayward woman who finds a wonderful opportunity and makes the most out of it. Her change to a real classy lady is done with style by Roberts.With a wonderful musical score and words to follow, 'Pretty Woman' is delightful, uplifting and well worth to view.",9,0,1,22 April 2006
Some Like It Hot," **** and More for Classic Comedy Film
","Billy Wilder was really at the top of his game with this screwball comedy hit of 1959.When loser-musicians Joe and Jerry (Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon) witness the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago, they look to leave town at once. While in freezing Chicago, they seek out an opportunity to join an all girls' band that's headed towards Florida.Our 2 heroes soon adopt the names of Josephine and Daphne and that's when the hilarity really begins. The film has a top-notch cast including Marilyn Monroe in the part that was made for her-Sugar Kowalski- a love stricken loser who loves to hit the booze to drown out her problems. Joyce Jameson, a frequent artist under Wilder, is in rare form as Sweet Sue, the head of the band. Joey E. Brown as the millionaire who falls for Daphne is just divine and George Raft, as Spats, the guy who is the head of the gang and after Josephine and Daphne, is in perfect form. Pat O'Brien is simply memorable as the chief of police.After a wonderful existence in hiding out in Florida, the 2 come face to face with the gang when the latter shows up there for a salute to the Friends of the Italian Opera.The writing is near perfect along with the performances. Curtis' imitation of Cary Grant is memorable.'Some Like It Hot' should have been nominated for best picture in 1959. It would have lost anyway to 'Ben-Hur' but this film is truly a tribute to comedy. Anway, wasn't this better than the nominated 'Anatomy of A Murder?'",10,1,2,26 June 2007
Inside Man," Inside Man-The Bank Robbery that Never Was? ***
","The film starts off as another 'Dog Day Afternoon,' and for those of you who remember, 'Violent Saturday.'Yes, a bank is allegedly robbed and hostages are taken. Something is terribly wrong when the chief inspector, Denzel Washington, provokes the gang leader, Clive Owen to shoot one of the hostages. There is plenty of screaming and yelling by the shaken hostages. A Jewish woman refers to the gang as Mishagunim(crazies) when they tell the victims to undress. We have an assortment of people in the bank of all different ethnicities.Christopher Plummer is the bank's Board Executive who has a terrible dark secret hidden in one of the vaults. He sends in executive Jodie Foster to pay off the gang. They leave and the hostages are thrown to the ground and are forced on a bus by the police.We have a racist cop who would rather live to be an old aged bigot as compared to a young dead liberal and a Sikh bank employee who is harassed by the police when he is freed and a hint of the bank's collaboration with the Nazis during World War 11.The movie begins to falter once the hostages were released without incident and it is shown that the gang used fake guns, bullets and took no money whatsoever. What's going on here you ask? A good caper goes awry at the end.",7,1,1,23 August 2006
Hoosiers," Hooray for Hoosiers ****
","A truly wonderful basketball film with Gene Hackman arriving at a small Indiana town in 1951 to coach a high school basketball team. Hackman's arrival meets with contempt by the town's people as he attempts to instill his brand of discipline to a young team. Of course, when it's discovered why he left New York, it doesn't help his cause as well.The set decorations best depict Indiana during this period. Conservative as always, the people respect human values, but will they be tolerant of this newcomer?Barbara Hershey, as the acting principal of the school, is a difficult character to fathom. With pride for her school, yet an unhappiness but willingness to remain at the home town, her character needed more development, but is more than sufficient as depicted.This is definitely a story of redemption, commitment, and small town values in the 1950s. Dennis Hopper has some scene stealing moments as a town drunkard, who with a son on the team, eventually finds his way. Hopper was nominated for a well deserved best supporting actor Oscar for this 1986 film.",10,0,2,3 June 2013
Pulp Fiction," **1/2
","You know that the several supposed unrelated stories are going to connect and some point and connect they do as the film reaches it climax.The stories of a gangster's wife, a boxer, two hit-men and others have a way of blending in at the end that actually makes sense.This is also a story of redemption and how a perceived miracle affected our story in a way that when a young couple take place, a character such as that of Samuel L. Jackson seeks redemption by handing over the loot to Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer during their bold restaurant robbery.It is also the story of a redeeming Bruce Willis who makes it out safely only to return to rescue leader Victor Rhames, who he had been shooting it out with when the two were captured by a white supremacy group ready to inflict severe pain on Rhames for being black.An interesting premise nicely done, but the film is overly violent and you really don't know in the end if all concerned have learned their lessons.",6,2,5,17 November 2015

","A very heart rendering film where a school coach comes to a disadvantaged Mexican school in Los Angeles and starts a running team there.While the film is clichéd, there are good rendering moments when eventually he forsakes an opportunity to go to a much better position to work with these fellows.Kevin Costner is perfectly cast as the coach. He actually goes out and not only lives among these people; he works in the fields as well. Nothing better than to get to know someone by living in their shoes.Maria Bello is rather subdued as his wife. Perhaps, it's because she is the mother of his two daughters.",9,1,1,31 October 2015
Les Misérables," Les Miserables Cinema TRES MAGNIFIQUE ****
","Author Victor Hugo would have been very proud of this 2012 adaptation of his memorable classic.Folks, why are people criticizing Russell Crowe's singing voice? He was quite good and he reminded me somewhat of Charles Laughton in the mid 1930s dramatic adaptation. Crowe is relentless in his pursuit of Jean Valjean.Hugh Jackman was magnificent in the title role.There is certainly revolution in the air in this endearing film. Anne Hathaway, as the tragic Fantine, was good, but in no way should have been considered for the best supporting actress award.This is a film dealing with injustice, obsession with the law, tragedy, love and hate. Human understanding is the ultimate redemption here.",10,1,5,31 August 2013
The Da Vinci Code," DaVinci Code Hard to Decipher This One **1/2
","Even though I did not read the book, I am not at all surprised why Catholic groups are outraged by this film. Fiction or not,it is really insulting to Catholic tenet.Tom Hanks is really miscast in the lead here. A better choice would have been Ralph Fiennes.The acting in this film is stolen by Ian McCellan, who turns in a fabulous performance as a rogue providing further mystery to a very old church secret. Alfred Molina, as the renegade priest, brings sustained energy to the role.The picture is too long and should have ended with the McCellan arrest.The murderous monk is portrayed by someone who looks like a very young Malcolm McDowall of 'A Clockwork Orange' fame.It would have been interesting how Mel Gibson would have handled this film. I wonder who he would have blamed for this one.",5,3,7,25 May 2006
Titanic," This Titanic Survives All the Time ****
","An excellent version of the 1953 original as well as the 1956 'A Night to Remember.'We really have character development in this fine picture. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet shine as our doomed hero and heroine. In a comeback performance, Gloria Stuart does very well in the part of Winslet as an old woman.What is so enjoyable about this film is the sociological depiction of the upper and lower classes. We can see from almost the beginning of the disaster, the lower class will be doomed to tragedy.Frances Fisher gives excellent support as Kate's upper class mean mother. This is a mother so mean that Kate went through life never revealing to her that she had survived.Di Caprio, it has been argued, looked too young for the part. He really seemed to mature as the film went on. His scene before his demise was well done and memorable.",10,3,6,15 March 2006
In Time," In Time-???????????????? 0*
","Let's not say awful but rather dreadful to describe this 2011 film. If everyone lives but to 26, look at all the money that would be saved by not having to pay pensions, social security,Medicare, etc. As ridiculous as that statement is, that's how ridiculous this entire mess of a movie becomes.People try desperately to by time. What an existence. Those who buy their way into life, they never age. When you run out of time, as shown on your hand, (you'd think that everyone in the film had been in a concentration camp by the numbers stamped on their hand)you simply drop dead.Of course, our hero rescues our heroine and takes her away from her boring existence to start robbing banks, the main one owned by her father. No, they're not exactly 'Bonnie and Clyde,' but that's just what is needed to give credence to this abominable film.",1,5,12,19 July 2012
The Fountain," The Fountain She Studied Science in Junior High School **1/2
","Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are well cast in this film. Their acting is quite good but in reality, what are they really trying to achieve here?The film has its good moments when it is up-to-date with a dedicated doctor desperately trying to save his wife from a fatal brain tumor.The ancient scenes are absolutely ridiculous and are even laugh-worthy. Discussing tree of life, problems in Spain et al could have been avoided here.Veteran pro Ellen Burstyn as Dr. Lillian provides some good moments as an understanding doctor in a world of reality but her role is wasted here. Perhaps, it would have been more exciting to bring another exorcism in here.Jackman's line that death is a disease is a catchy one. Only in the end does he accept some form of reality.As for Ms. Weisz stating that she studied science in junior high school, my high school chemistry teacher would take umbrage at that.Life, as we know it, sure isn't a bowl of cherries as this film wisely depicts.",6,2,8,5 December 2006
It's a Wonderful Life," It's A Wonderful Picture-'Wonderful Life' Terrific ****
","Who can ever imagine what life would be like without them had they not been born? A very clever idea put to the test in the classic 1946 film, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'As George Bailey, James Stewart truly shined. Anytime he was about to leave his town, tragedy struck and poor George could never leave.Lionel Barrymore steals the show as a cantankerous businessman nearly succeeding in bringing ruin to Bailey.Donna Reed is marvelous as his George's wife. Remember that famous dance scene as the boards open and the young teens fall into the water? That scene in itself is a classic.If we could only see what it would be like had we not been born. We could see that our beloved ones and others may have lived totally different lives with divergent personalities.",10,2,7,7 March 2006

Played admirably by Russell Crowe, this guy really has some serious hangups.Married to his former student,played by supporting actress Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly, the professor goes through some rough stages, and even as the movie ends there are still problems with his mental condition.Crowe is absolutely phenomenal. His poor off screen behavior led to his losing this Oscar.The film conveniently doesn't mention that Nash had a history of anti-semitism. Accuracy should have been maintained, that's even a law of mathematics!",9,1,6,7 March 2006

","Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie do make a nice couple.Their marriage has its hangups but whose doesn't? Trouble is that their life has been a lie. They are both hit people for different organizations.They live in a magnificent mansion and he complains about her cooking.The fun begins when they are both given the assignment to take out the same person. When this fails, they discover each other's real work and the fireworks start. A memorable fight ensues in their home similar to what we saw in 'War of the Roses.' As they point the guns towards each other, they realize that they love one another.Finding out what is really going on becomes the main theme. Unfortunately, the movie soon deteriorates into a huge shoot 'em up battle scenes on a highway. We get some funny lines between the shots where they confess their 'real lives.'

The Departed," I Couldn't Wait to Depart from the Violence **
","Martin Scorsese, the master of gang epics, is at it again. This time in 'The Departed,' he uses modern technology to show what mobsters et al can do to create mayhem.The acting here is first rate as Jack Nicholson, who portrays a vicious criminal, is right on target. His antics are terrific. Leonardo De Caprio delivers a knockout performance as the guy working secretly for the police. Matt Damon does a fine job as the guy going in the opposite direction.The film deals with 2 young men recruited to serve in various capacities. One works for the mob to infiltrate the state police department in Boston, the other is a cop working for the mob boss. You would think that their lives would connect sooner as both see and fall for a female doctor.The violence and use of the 4 letter word is really too much to bear. Look for nice supporting performances from Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg as veteran cops.The film goes downhill in quality as the body count begins to mount. This film is certainly not for the squeamish.",5,8,12,26 October 2006
Glory Road," Glory Road-Basketball Flick Packs Powerful Bounce ***1/2
",Josh Lucas is outstanding as a coach who courts black players from the U.S. to star on the Texas Midwest Basketball team.The film is so good because it successfully integrates basketball with the struggle for civil rights during the Viet Nam era.The Caucasian players on the team try to be supportive of their black colleagues but they remark that they have been pushed to the back with the advent of a mostly black team.The film depicts the taunts that the black members had to go through. Coming into a motel room and seeing derogatory terms all over the wall was a disgrace at best.Their almost undefeated season and trip to the NCAA is a memorable fête to watch. They eventually make the final and play the longstanding champion team Kentucky led by its veteran coach Adolph Rupp (Jon Voight). Voight gained a lot of weight for the part. He doesn't say much but his facial expressions tell it all-there is bigotry all over him.A must see film. This is the first time that a mother was brought into a college class to get her lazy son back into the field of geology.The film is memorable and ends in an upbeat fashion.

","Action packed is to put it mildly. A very engrossing film with Bruce Willis starring as a N.Y.C. police officer who goes to Los Angeles to see a retired comrade and his estranged wife, Bonnie Bedelia and their two children.Go know that he would get caught up in quite a thriller, where supposed terrorists take over the building during his visit. McClain curses, smokes but is able to thwart the attempts by these terrorists, who as the film progresses, are shown to be nothing more than robbers.Willis is evenly matched by Alan Rickman, the mastermind of the gang, With his sinister looks, Rickman is the embodiment of evil. That speaking voice of his goes a long way to create such a character.The destruction to that building is phenomenal. The picture also shows you the reluctance of the LAPD to react at first to such a situation and the bond that Willis forms with an LA officer, hesitant in using his gun because he killed a 13 year old with it some time before.A wonderful film.",9,1,3,18 September 2012

Guests generally check in and do check out in the most ghastly manner.This is an intense psychological thriller with Anthony Perkins stealing the show as the psychotic killer who has also assumed the identity of the mother he murdered 10 years before and her apparent cruelty sticks with him from the deeds he has done.It does take for picture's end for Simon Oakland, as the detective, to explain what has been going on.Vera Miles, as her sister, John Gavin, as her lover, and Martin Balsam, the detective who sets out to find her after she is missing, are all in her orbit.

","The movie may be accused of stereotyping Italian Americans. We saw this accusation leveled against Saturday Night Fever when the latter came out in 1977.Nonetheless, we have an accurate representation of 4 Jersey boys who were headed for a life of crime in the mob and managed to turn it all around and achieve success as the highly popular The Four Seasons.The movie also shows that success and money aren't always everything, as we see the trials, tribulations, heartbreak and even tragedy befall our group.The group of men who are not big stars are absolutely fabulous here as they beautifully capture their beginnings, success, failures and ultimate triumph in the music world.",10,1,2,12 April 2015
The Holiday," Take in This Holiday ***1/2
","Wonderful romantic comedy that will remind you of the comedies of the 1940s. Jude Law does a wonderful take-off of Cary Grant, who this picture certainly was made for.Two women- Hollywood's Cameron Diaz and England's Kate Winslet exchange their homes online for two weeks after experiencing major disappointments in their respective boyfriends. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to them. Both are literally swept off their feet in new endearing love affairs.This film deals with the ability to be daring and make a change during times of adversity.As Arthur Abbott, a retired screenwriter of Hollywood's golden years, Eli Wallach etched still another unforgettable character. He is just fabulous in the role as an elderly widower who with his Oscar and other accolades, refuses to be honored by his peers.This is just a grand film and I certainly recommend it for viewing.",8,3,5,17 October 2007

She shows that she has a mouth and can curse with the best of the boys.Chastain gave a rather interesting compelling performance as the woman who discovered bin Laden's hiding place and was very sure of herself in relation to her male counter parts.Let us also give tremendous credit to the Navy Seals who so bravely entered the compound in Pakistan to take down the terror-master mind.",8,3,5,3 November 2013

","I was extremely disappointed with the film despite the fine acting of Michael Fassbender, in the title role and Kate Winslet, as his marketing expert. At the beginning, I thought Winslet was Meryl Streep with horned-rim glasses and a get up in the style of Bette Davis's beginning in 'Now, Voyager.' Notice how pretty Winslet looked as the film went on.The film depicted Jobs as a real hustler, tough, but brilliant and not ready to compromise on his views or on his product.Jeff Daniels was convincing in a supporting role as the fired CEO of Apple.The film details Jobs finally admitting that he fathered a girl and his later stormy relationship with her as the 19 year old intellectual from Harvard.",4,0,1,28 September 2016

He hasn't seen his son in 24 years and when he finally contacts him, the lad refuses to meet him and tells him that his mother is dead.I never saw someone go through rehabilitation as quickly as Bridges does in the movies. Remember, Susan Hayward's stint in rehab in 'I'll Cry Tomorrow?' That really meant something. That's what is lacking in this film.Maggie Gyllenhaal was nominated as the New Mexico reporter who becomes the love of his life.

The latter look like replicas from the various 1950 monster films. The major difference is that they're filled with modern technology.Oscar winner Tim Robbins steals this poor film in a brief appearance as a demented person ready to fight these monsters at any cost.The ending is contrived as the family reunites. It was shown earlier that the older son was killed but miraculously he returns in an imitation ending film scene depicted in 'Ben-Hur.'

There Will Be Blood," There Will Be Blood- The Blood Sure Clots in the Last 20 Minutes **
","I have never seen a film to deteriorate in the last 20 minutes in the way that 'There Will Be Blood' does.The film has a great plot- a man who becomes very wealthy from oil drilling, and the apparent abandoning of his son who is deafened by the blast of oil being discovered.I thought that this would be the basic story line, the relationship between father and son through the years. Instead, we see the horrible relationship between Lewis and the town pastor.This film is certainly an anti-religious one. At the end, we see the human frailties possessed by the pastor. The two had a fight by film's end in a manner that reminded me of Max Bialystock and Leo Blum fighting in 1967's 'The Producers.' The ending is simply awful.Before the last 20 minutes, Lewis gives a restrained but powerful performance as the wealthy oil driller who is really insane.A the time of the horrible ending, Lewis announces to his valet that he is finished. He should have been so 20 minutes sooner.",5,9,18,9 April 2008
Burlesque," This 'Burlesque' Cleans Up its Act ***
","I don't know what the negative reviews are all about. We have a nice movie here with Christina Aguliera belting out her songs quite well at a Hollywood burlesque place where she is working.The only negative thing I could say about the movie is the real lackluster performance by Cher. True, she has her moments, especially when she belts out the title song. Otherwise, I found her lacking in emotion with her continuous deadpan expression, or lack of expression.The dance numbers are well staged and there is a gem of a performance by Stanley Tucci, the gay director of Tess. (Cher)The movie goes nicely as the song and dance routines basically tell us the story. There is no hard violence here, a welcomed sight.",8,1,3,6 July 2011
To Kill a Mockingbird," To Kill A Mockingbird-Greg Peck vs. Prejudice Again ****
","Truly an outstanding film with Gregory Peck once more fighting prejudice as he did so brilliantly in 1947's 'Gentleman's Agreement.' Peck should have been made the forever spokesperson to promote religious and racial understanding and tolerance among people.With a truly haunting musical score that will be forever remembered,Peck's Oscar-winning performance here is a restrained one, but terrific nonetheless, as Advocate, Atticus Finch, defending a black man accused of molestation. While doing this, he must cope with being a parent to his two children; he is a widower in 1932 Alabama, a time of crisis in America where a campaigning FDR has stated that we have nothing to fear but fear itself.The supporting cast is just marvelous here. Mary Badham, as his daughter, received a supporting Oscar nomination and one wonders why others such as his movie-son, the alleged rape victim and her father were overlooked.

","This Oscar winning film of 1957, 'The Bridge on the River Kwai,' is a little too heavy handed.One of the prisoners has it right, 'won't building this bridge be seen as an act of treason?'Captured by the Japanese, Col. Nicholson and his men agree to build such a bridge. They put a tremendous effort into it. At no time is there ever a discussion of trying to escape. What would John Wayne have done?Nicholson's lame excuse is that in years to come people will thank the English for building the bridge. He anticipates a world at peace with respect and toleration for all cultures. Baloney. You're at war, Mr. Nicholson.At the end, Nicholson cries out in regret, 'What have I done!,' as he collapses and destroys the bridge. What was the writer really thinking.As always, William Holden is effective, this time as an ant-war hero caught up in this predicament. Jack Hawkins acts in his usual bombastic overbearing way.The cinematography is beautiful but the story itself is far from the realm of reality. War is war.",6,5,16,4 February 2006
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Surviving the Nut House ***
","Jack Nicholson's first Oscar winning performance as a patient in a mental institution.Based on Ken Kesey's best seller, we come to realize that the heads of these institutions are in desperate need themselves. This movie correctly showed what goes on in these institutions.Nurse Mildred Ratched was skillfully played by Louise Fletcher, who won the best actress Oscar. Needless to say that an argument could be made that Nurse Ratched was a supporting performance. Fletcher also benefited from the fact that Elizabeth Taylor and Anne Bancroft turned the part down. Could one imagine Geraldine Page doing this role? She would have had a field day with it.Anyway, Ratched is an instigator. She riles the inmates up and then steps away after calling for emergency assistance. She is sicker than anyone confined there. This nurse actually believed that she was helping the patients by her strong beliefs in instilling scheduling and no change in the routine for the inmates. Obviously, she turns on McMurphy because he is a threat to her very existence.Nicholson, ideal for the role, made the most of it. His refusal to conform shall lead to his ultimate downfall. Note a strong performance by Brad Dourif as one of the inmates, who Ratched destroys in one of her blistering fits.Remember our short friend Mr. Cheswick? Vulnerable, his nervousness was memorable in a well designed film.",8,0,2,9 March 2006
The Wolf of Wall Street," ***1/2
","Wall Street with all the sleaze, alcohol, partying, drugs and illegal trading is well-stated in this 2013 film.Leonardo DiCaprio literally owned the part as the sleazy trader who takes a dormant company and brings it to the heights with memorable shenanigans.The object is of course to make money and have mayhem along the way with all the sexual activities going on among the employees and everyone living the care-free high life without cause for alarm.We know that at some point that all of this must end because after all, illegal trading is going on.This is basically the story of how the lust for money may destroy people within its grasp.",9,0,4,14 June 2016
The Last King of Scotland," Last King of Scotland-Doctor Wasn't Needed in this House **1/2
","Forest Whitaker's interpretation of the late lunatic Ugandan leader, Idi Amin, was good but not Oscar worthy. In some of the scenes Whitaker mouths the words as if he is being forced to. The person who made him up for this difficult part does deserve praise.A young Scottish man, just graduated from the University as a doctor, goes to Uganda and in a chance meeting, he comes across the new dictator Amin. The latter has just overthrown the unjust Obote, and in a general compassionate speech, he promises the citizens of Uganda the world. Everyone cheers but the ruthlessness of Amin soon begins to show.He takes his young doctor under his charge and at first the man is doing everything but doctoring. He even steps in for the Ugandan dictator at an important meeting. When our doctor sees what's going on, he tries to escape, but it's too late. He is severely brutalized and it is amazing that he survived. He is fixed up by a doctor who shall soon receive a bullet in his head for his efforts. Our young hero manages to get on a plane that has been reserved for the hostages take to Uganda by Amin's Palestinian friends. By the way, the film never showed the Israelis saving all but one of Israel's hostages.A lot of this film is almost reading like a soap opera. We could have entitled it 'As Your Stomach Can Turn from Amin.'",6,2,4,17 April 2007

","In the future, if you're ever asked who was the 21st president,? you shall use Abe Lincoln as a guide. Since Honest Abe was our 16th, just go down the line of Johnson, Grant, Hayes,Garfield and Arthur, as in Chester A. Arthur.That being said, we have an action packed film where Jeremy Irons pretends that he wants revenge for his brother's death in L.A. Just like in the case of the brother,it's all about money-the gold at the Federal Reserve Bank of N.Y. We have bombings of a department store and subway for Irons to show that he means business.Bruce Willis was born to play John McClane, the fast talking, foul-mouthed policeman who is on suspension but is called back to service thanks to Irons's sinister ways. McClane is evenly matched with racist store owner,Samuel L. Jackson, who is brought into the plot and by film's end, he realizes that all whites aren't necessarily bad.The action is non-stop and very fast paced. A thriller in every sense of the word.",9,0,0,23 December 2012

","Somewhat interesting film featuring a child prodigy and a supporting performance by Robin Williams that is a cross between The Hustler and Midnight Cowboy.The theme of this film is that music transcends all and serves as a link to all of us. This is done when our prodigy seeks out his parents.Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Williams are appealing as the parents who produced this child after a one night stand. By the way, where was Russell when her father gave the boy up at birth?What a great way for self-discovery at a concert in Central Park. This is definitely a story of hope and ultimate fulfillment.",6,0,1,20 June 2010
American Gangster," American Gangster-They Glorify Gangsters, don't they? **1/2
","Whether it's 'Bonnie and Clyde,' or 'American Gangster,' we have a tendency in motion pictures to glorify gangsters. The fact remains that these people are the absolute scum of the earth for what they have done to society.Frank Lucas is made out to be the true hero instead of the cop who earnestly tries to bring him down. As a result, Russell Crowe's part as the cop, is really watered down and Denzell Washington, as Lucas, is glorified.The first hour or so of this film is tedious at best. It is in the second half hour that a gripping story is told of attempts to smuggle in narcotics via the dead bodies of the heroes of the Vietnam War. Corruption is everywhere in this true story including the New York City police department. What a scandal!As far as Ruby Dee being nominated for best supporting actress in this film, my comment is for what? Her part rivals Judi Dench in 'Shakespeare in Love,' or Beatrice Straight in 'Network.' Yet, people are predicting that she will be the winner of the award this year. For what? She gave a good slap in the face to Washington but is that really acting? I don't want to hear that Dee will win for the compilation of great performances over the years. Fine, then she should have won years back for far more worthy material.",Null,1,4,20 February 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Stranger than Fiction-Beyond Comprehension 0*
","Absolutely dreadful film of a character in a book who is really a person. Since the character at the end of the book dies, the writer (a totally screwed up Emma Thompson) wants that the person also depart. Our hero here is Will Ferrell and the problem with this stinker is that the plot makes no sense.When Ferrell hears voices, psychiatrist Linda Hunt refers him to a literature teacher. That turns out to be Dustin Hoffman who is teaching 5 classes and monitoring 2 Ph.D candidates but still has enough time to be a lifeguard.Hoffman tells Ferrell to stay home so that the plot can't continue. Ferrell does this only to have a wrecking crew demolish his home by mistake. What are we being told here?Thompson chain smokes cigarettes like they're going out of style. When a tape in Hoffman's office reveals her as the voice, Ferrell pursues her.In the midst of all this, there is a growing romance between Ferrell an IRS agent and Maggie Gylenhaal who refuses to pay part of her taxes to go to the military.The ending where Ferrell is supposed to die for saving a boy from being hit by a bus is the whole story. We could have had this 10 minutes into this film.",1,2,16,23 September 2007

","M.C. Duncan steals the picture with a tremendous supporting performance as a black gentleman, accused of murdering two children, who has a gift to heal people. No, he is not Elmer Gantry, but you know that he couldn't be guilty of such a crime by his very demeanor.An elderly man tells the story to a woman in a nursing home of when he was a guard some 60+ years before.We meet a whole assortment of condemned prisoners as well as one of the guards who is as sadistic as they come.Tom Hanks is grand as the young guard who shows compassion for the inmates.The film is also definitely one exposing the horrors of the death penalty.There is a fine supporting cast as well with Patricia Clarkson, a grossly under-rated actress, doing a stunning turn as a woman dying of a brain tumor.The film gets even better when a chain of events allows practically everyone to get what they deserved with the exception of the Duncan character.",8,1,2,5 May 2012
The Reader," The Reader-Don't Blame Illiteracy on this One **
","Extremely disappointing post-World War 11 film in Germany. A totally undeserved Oscar win for Kate Winslet. She, as others in the past, got the compensation award for previously losing the coveted award. Surely, Meryl Streep in 'Doubt,' and Ann Hathaway in 'Rachel Getting Married' gave far better performances.As for this movie, most of the story could have been told in 40 minutes or so. The best line of the movie in my opinion was that Jewish people don't have to worry about illiteracy. How true that is.Winslet was often droll here. I expected her to breakout at some point but that never occurred. The prosecuting attorney was without emotion here. Remember Max Schell in that kind of role in 'Judgment at Nuremberg?' David Kross deserves acting kudos for his role as the young man caught up in a sexual romp with Hannah Schmitz, (Winslet)Both Kross and an older Ralph Fiennes play the role of Michael Berg. I was expecting to hear at some point that Berg was Jewish. After all, it is a Jewish name.While it is true that their romance took place over one summer, the film is missing a steaminess. When he discovers what Hannah has done, Cross keeps his head down as if he is ashamed to have been associated with her. After all, he never visited her in prison.Let us never try to make Hannah a compassionate person because she was illiterate. As the Nazi guard, she knew exactly what she was doing in the selection process. In addition, this illiterate had her victims read to her before they met their cruel fate. Was she trying to exploit her young lover in the same way?",4,9,14,11 June 2009
Jaws," Jaws-Claw Your Way Into This One ***
","While it's not 'Schindler's List,' this 1975 thriller is exciting by the nature of its topic.The first part of the movie deals with the town's lack of response when it becomes quite evident that a shark is on a killing spree. What happens to Mayor Murray Hamilton for failing to act? Hamilton, in a fine supporting performance, depicts that same lack of kindness that he showed 8 years before as the husband of Anne Bancroft in 'The Graduate.'Roy Scheider, whose career really never took off, hits his stride as the police chief. The late Robert Shaw gives a tremendous performance as the adventurer with the problem that he garbles his words when he spoke. There were several scenes where I found it difficult to understand him.Lorraine Gary, as the wife of police chief Brody,(Scheider) is adequate but she doesn't seem to be caught up enough in the action.The second part of the film deals with our trio-Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw, on board to kill the ferocious beast. While I will be in the minority here, I felt that the film begins to drag somewhat. Yes, the scenes with the shark trying to kill our heroes are great, due in part to the wonderful editing here, but the talk among the central characters is down right dull after a while.",8,0,2,10 July 2007

","Ordinary story of a dejected wrestler who dreams for a comeback. Quite appropriate for Mickey Rourke as he has been out of the limelight for years now. Nonetheless, his performance was really nothing special except that he needed much physical stamina for it.To me, Rachel Evan Wood steals the movie for her fine supporting work as his dejected daughter. If Viola Davis could have been nominated for best supporting actress in 'Doubt' for 1 scene, Wood should have been so as well.Marisa Tomei also fares well as the stripper who has mixed feelings about Rourke.Basically a film about 3 unhappy people whose unhappiness spills over to one another.By the way, when bypass surgery occurs it's time to call a halt to wrestling.",6,1,3,25 April 2009

","The best part of this 2012 film is Karen Carpenter's rendition of Top of the World. Other than that, this is one totally forgettable film.Tim Burton and Johnny Depp seem both to have become masters in Gothic horror-direction and acting, respectively.A usual curse is placed on someone, Depp, and he is freed from a casket to arrive in 1972's Maine where his ancestors had come from England.The family is made up of essentially the characters The Munsters from television fame.Michelle Pfeifer, believe it or not, is actually normal. With a red wig, Helena Bonham Carter plays a psychiatrist there to help a disturbed child. Carter is literally a blood sucker and pays for it. Some good acting is realized by Eva Green, the woman who cursed the Collins Family for the Depp character not loving her.There is all sorts of mayhem and utter madness, but this is far from a satisfying movie.",2,5,9,8 June 2013

Charlize Theron had better cut it out. She is getting too typecast in monster-like lunatic parts. This is not a good way at all for her career to go.The story, as stated, falls apart due to the most absurd writing imaginable. Theron and Will Smith going back through the ages, and each time they're near one another, there is havoc.They should have stuck with the beginning of the good things that Will Smith did as a hero.",2,4,8,21 June 2009

","You know the old story. So and so can help anyone except himself. We find it again in Hitch, a silly movie about basically silly characters.The best scene of this poor film is probably at Ellis Island.Will Smith is certainly no Dear Abby. His help almost backfires on him.The character Allegra, to me, was deadpan. With that name, she would be more needed to clear up my allergic reaction to this film.I love the way that characters, who supposedly can't dance, can dance up a storm, especially when they're playing fat nerdy type individuals. Even the psychiatrist character in the film needs help. I still can't figure out her brief over-the-top hysterical outburst. Maybe, the film would have better been served with a Barbra Streisand like rendition of 'People needing people.' This film, for sure, needs a complete makeover. *.",2,1,4,23 December 2005

With that sweet face turning disturbed, what were the writers really thinking of?Natalie Portman's performance here is quite weak. She talks like an immature teenager. I don't see the necessary emotion that it takes. The talented Jimmy Smits and Samuel L. Jackson are given little to do. Jackson was fortunate enough to get bumped off quickly in this film.Spare us any further Star Wars films. This is a classic stinker.",4,1,6,3 June 2006

They warn her to keep the door locked for they know that the Queen will stop at nothing to kill Snow White, so that she can be the fairest of them all.It is to be noted that Lucille LaVerne played both the wicked Queen and the old woman disguised to bring death to Snow White. Miss LaVerne was the wicked woman with the guillotine in 1935's memorable 'A Tale of Two Cities,' as well as the loving mother in 1931's 'An American Tragedy,' which was made over as 'A Place in the Sun,' in 1951.This film is a **** production in every sense of the word.

The trouble is that Danny Glover and others, who hired Walhberg to do this, have real murderous intentions pending so Wahlberg is duped and soon becomes a man running on the loose.The special effects here are quite good and we learn that our government is corrupt and that murders have occurred in Africa for our selfish oil interests.Ned Beatty plays a greedy U.S. senator involved in murder for oil.Exciting, interesting and definitely a picture for our current times.",8,2,6,24 July 2007

As is the case with any such situation, there is tension and division. Daniel Craig is one brother who wants to stay with the group while his brother joined the Russian army in defense of their Motherland against Nazi Germany.We have Jewish people of all various groups. In fact,Liev Schriber, the militant of the brothers, makes mention of the fact that the wealthier Jews among them had looked down on the poorer ones.Everyone was assigned a specific task within the community.

Lord of War," Lord of War-...And to think It All Began in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn***
",Nicolas Cage gives an admirable performance in this film as a Ukrainian émigré seeking a better life for himself in Brooklyn. The family came here pretending to be Jewish so as to get out of the old Soviet Union faster. It is true that Russian Jews intermarried among Jews so as to leave the Soviet Union but carrying this to the point that they acted as Jews once they were here was a bit ridiculous.Cage and his brother get into the life of gun-runners. We follow their escapades through various countries. They supply the guns to the highest bidder. They couldn't care less why the guns are being used.The film deals at length with their trips to a corrupt Liberian government.Cage marries along the way and has an ideal life which eventually catches up with him. The film deals with a CIA agent (Ethan Hawke) who actively pursues him until he realizes that Cage is also a government plant who will be allowed to continue to do this as long as the interests of the American government is served. Corruption was never worse.Very nice cinematography marks an engaging film.,7,0,2,9 December 2006

","Robert De Niro directs and co-stars in this memorable film dealing with the birth of the CIA and one member's eventual disillusionment with the top secret organization.Both Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie give career performances in this film. With his thick glasses, Damon is a powerful figure in a restrained performance as a CIA agent who sacrifices his life for working for the famous agency. Jolie has never been better as the neglected wife that he had to marry when he got her in trouble.Detailing the rise of the agency as World War 11 was about to begin, we see with the effective use of flashbacks, the Kennedy debacle at the Bay of Pigs and going back to 1939 as war breaks out in Europe and a covert group is needed and assembled.We have a terrific supporting performance by Michael Gambon, as a supposedly Nazi sympathetic British college professor who is a double agent but is put to death because of his homosexual activities being viewed as a threat.",8,1,2,6 June 2007
The Blind Side," Blind Side-Cliché Ridden To the Hilt **1/2
","We've seen, read and heard about this so many times. Problem with this film is that it is handled in the typical way. I am referring to the fact that a tall black young man coming out of a terrible environment lives with an affluent black family and the opportunities for him abound.Sandra Bullock, in her Oscar winning performance, plays the liberal woman who takes this young man in. Despite an 80 IQ and an inability to read, he soon succeeds in a private religious school due to his ability to remember what has been said. This is so cliché.Of course, there has to be prejudice shown as we're dealing with the old south. Isn't it about time that 2008 presidential election results really hit home? Bullock encounters his real drug addicted mother. The father goes over a run-way to his demise, colleges beckon for the young man, Bullock and husband are accused by the NCAA of working for Old Mississippi to get the lad to go to their school on a football scholarship. Our young man goes back to see his mother and could have fallen in with the local hoodlums, but common sense prevails. How many times have we heard this all before?Unbelievable that Bullock received an Oscar for this part. Her competition must have been extremely weak.",6,8,13,2 October 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Shawshank Redemption- Prison Film is Redeemed by Quality ****
","An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good 'Forrest Gump.'Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with murder. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown.As the corrupt, insane warden invoking religion to justify his actions, Mr. Gunton gives a worthy performance.This is a film of rare power. James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom.Politics is also depicted in a negative way in this gritty film. This is a memorable viewing experience for audiences.",10,4,5,26 January 2011

","Hugh Grant does a wonderful take off as a rock singer attempting to make a comeback. The problem is that there isn't much to go by here.As for Drew Barrymore's portrayal of Sophie Fisher, the part really requires a quirky young girl. That's another problem here as Drew's interpretation of Sophie is anything but quirky.Naturally, the two meet when it's determined that Sophie can write lyrics. The problem they encounter is that they have to write a song for a Brittany Spear look-alike who sounds really just awful. Sophie doesn't like what they have written but of course love shall conquer all. It usually does in these silly pictures.Nevertheless, this was a fairly nice change of pace for the usual foolish Grant. At least, in this film, he is a washed-up rock singer who needs a hit record.

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," **1/2 More Like Bird Brain
","Despite the phenomenal acting of Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, this film brings a new definition to the word quirky. It deals with a has-been movie actor attempting a comeback via a Broadway production.It seems that the cast is normal when they act out the play on stage and then revert to all sorts of bizarre behavior, neurotic behavior and other nonsense in the dressing rooms of the theater they are performing at.It goes to show the frustration of acting and alter egos taking over. It is also shows the power of critics, in this case, the woman critic who though she hasn't seen the play, plans to demolish it with a scathing review, as she feels that Keaton and his brew lack artistic talent.The ending is sad, but in life, such things can very well happen, especially when we are dealing with neurotic characters. Amazing to me that the motion picture academy chose to reward this neurotic mess with a best picture Oscar.",6,2,3,1 August 2015

","'Scream' is a terrible movie. There is basically no other way to put it.It started off pretty well as 2 young teenagers are bludgeoned to death. The true horror was yet to come.The movie really goes down in quality once the bodies start to pile up as it becomes a mass murdering picture.No one is really exempt from this including the school principal Henry Winkler. Imagine, Henry Winkler as a school principal. He still uses a 4 letter word before he falls victim to the murderer as well.This film was supposed to be clever. The killer(s) are worse than out of their minds. Everyone seems to be in the act and that's the trouble with this.When the killers are revealed, there is a logical explanation for what sent one of them off.

","Sissy Spacek in a totally brilliant Oscar nominated performance as a girl bewitched with telekinetic powers. Unhappy with life with a domineering brutal mother, whose takes her frustrations out on her and uses religion to justify her way of life, Spacek etched a memorable screen portrayal as 'Carrie.'Spacek was equally matched by Piper Laurie. The latter, brilliant as Paul Newman's girlfriend 15 years before in 'The Hustler,' achieved new heights in the role of the fanatic religious woman, afraid of sex and life in general,who would hide behind religion. Laurie was brutal on screen in a performance well worth to remember.We all know how mean children can be to their fellow classmates. We sure see it here. Only Bette Buckley,as a sympathetic gym teacher, tries to help the unhappy Carrie but apparently to no avail. The invitation extended to Carrie to attend the prom will only bring misery and eventual tragedy to all concerned.Brian De Palma's memorable film is terrific.

There, he falls in with a different crowd of youngsters. Our protagonist comes from a dysfunctional foster home where the father drinks beer all day. His two African American friends are two guys into prank making. Unfortunately, the younger brother, is afraid of nothing and he will meet a tragic ending.

To me,the picture made absolutely no sense whatsoever.We would have been far better off with a basic story of a young lawyer raising his son alone following the death of his wife in child birth.Instead, we get this moody piece filled with absolute terror and horror. I would certainly never recommend this junk to be seen by younger children.

The flashbacks relating to medieval times are of absolutely no value here.The one redeeming item in this otherwise awful film is the performance by veteran actor Michael Caine, as Bruce Wayne's faithful servant Alfred. He knows when it is time to go; he is dramatic when he has to be and he certainly knew when to pour on the tears.Anne Hathaway presents an interesting but conflicting character here.

It doesn't take much to realize that Bridges has his own agenda in this film and that he is up to absolutely no good whatsoever.The kids will love the special affects here, especially the fight between the two robots (Downey and Bridges) on that bridge near the film's end.",5,0,4,15 November 2008

","Finally, a realistic picture about teaching.Richard Dreyfuss is memorable as a new teacher in Mr. Holland's Opus.He begins a 30 year career as a music teacher in a large high school. He comes across his principal, Mrs. Jacobs, who demands a month of lesson plans in advance on her desk in the morning. Any teacher can understand what that is. Then, there is an assistant principal, devilishly played by, William H. Macy, who takes an instant dislike to Mr. Holland. He can't wait to'rat' him out to Mrs. Jacobs.Seeing that traditional teaching methods are not working, Holland tries unorthodox ways which of course riles Macy.The irony that a music teacher would have a child who is deaf. Beethoven could best understand that frustration.When Mrs. Jacobs informs Holland of her retirement, she says something to him that all teachers would love to hear: 'You were my favorite teacher.' Of course, Macy becomes the principal and as the years pass,the two still have a contentious relationship, as their hair turns gray.Holland works on that forever opus and is almost ready to give everything up and run away with a student until common sense prevails.After 30 years, there are budget cuts and the Music Department will be eliminated. Sounds familiar in today's climate?Mr. Holland will be forced into retirement but not before a rousing tribute by his present and former pupils. One very special student appears and it's a delight to see how far she has come.Richard Dreyfuss, in a memorable Oscar nominated performance, is magnificent. He conveys the ideals of a teacher and what we have to go through. This is truly a welcomed film for its reality and emotions shown.",10,3,5,8 January 2006
Ben-Hur," 'Ben Hur' Too good to be true
","This Oscar winning best film of 1959 is outstanding.It details the beginnings of the Christian religion through the eyes of Judah Ben-Hur, Charlton Heston, and his family.While the Romans occupied Judea, Heston has built a strong friendship with Roman centurion, Massala, played in a memorable vicious performance by the late Stephen Boyd.When a loose rock from Ben-Hur's house accidentally falls on a Roman, Massala condemns the family. He had begged Judah to throw his lot in with the Romans. Condemning his friend will throw fear into everyone since if he could do this to his best friend, anything is possible.While his mother and sister are sent to the dungeons and ultimately develop leprosy, Judah becomes a slave on a ship. Ultimately, saving the Roman head (Jack Hawkins), Judah returns from Rome and seeks revenge on Massala.The chariot race is the ultimate event. It is staged with an excellence beyond belief. Massala is ultimately killed and Judah will find his mother and sister in the leper colony. Their ultimate cure at the time of the crucifixion of Christ is memorable.The silent film 'Ben-Hur,' ended with Ben-Hur's conversion to Christianity from Judaism. Director William Wyler wisely chose not to do this.The supporting cast members of Haya Harareet and Sam Jaffe are terrific. As the sheik, Hugh Griffith was named best supporting actor. I can't believe this was done. Stephen Boyd should have been nominated here instead and should have been the winner.Heston deservedly won the best actor award.A wonderful gripping film.",10,2,5,15 January 2006
Casino Royale," Casino Royale-Downward Flush Quickly *1/2
","Disappointing James Bond thriller.James Craig comes across as a mean, nasty person and Judi Dench is finally given a bigger role as M. (Bernard Lee must be turning over.) I guess they finally had to reward Ms. Dench for her increasing number of Oscar nominations.Craig is good in the chase scenes and that's about all that this film has going for it. The story is somewhat confusing regarding the aftermath of 9/11 and airplane stocks. It would be better if Hollywood stopped milking Sept. 11, 2001.Craig, as Bond, lacks the suave, debonair feeling depicted by Roger Moore and Sean Connery. He also looks older than he should look in certain scenes.",4,8,19,31 March 2007
La Vie En Rose," La Vie en Rose- TRES MAGNIFIQUE ****
","Incredible film dealing with the life of Edith Piaf.I vividly remember Miss Piaf performing on the Sunday evening Ed Sullivan Show in the 1950s. No wonder she had such sad eyes. Her life was a travesty. Marvelously played by Marion Cotillard, the latter pulls out every stop possible in evoking the emotions of Piaf from a slum childhood to wealth and notoriety, but with constant tragedy and misery along those brief 47 years.Cotillard's singing is phenomena. Sorry Julie Christie, but Marion Cotillard richly deserved the Oscar. The constant flashes of scenes showing the 3 phases of her life, as a young girl, successful singer with tragedy ensuing, and her ultimate death of cancer, are all effectively done.",9,1,3,7 June 2008
Bull Durham," Bull is Durable ***
","You often wonder why certain guys never make it in baseball given the fact that they have potential. We see this in the film.Kevin Costner is absolutely wonderful as such a player. An experienced catcher, he has what it takes, but only lasted in the major leagues for a brief period. He is resigned to the Durham minor league team where he meets up with fan and announcer Susan Sarandon who acquires a great southern accent for her role.Tim Robbins is the pitcher that Costner is assigned to work with. His appearances are memorable. Strikeouts and walks are the same high amount. Watch out when he throws, anyone there is vulnerable. That's what happens to the film-the vulnerability of the Sarandon-Costner- Robbins relationship comes into question.",8,3,4,14 September 2014
Before Sunrise," Before Sunrise-It's No Brief Encounter **1/2
","An updated 'Brief Encounter' without 2 married couples but instead a young couple that finds love while riding through Austria. The sites that they view are far superior to the film itself. The problem with this boring film is that the characters are just constantly talking about their philosophies of life. After a half hour or so, you know where this is going.Nonetheless, the acting by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy is fine.Will they meet in 6 months as promised? Isn't this also an updated vehicle of the Katharine Hepburn-Rosano Brazzi 1955 dazzler 'Summertime?'",5,3,10,4 October 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Vicky Cristina is Barcelona Bull *
","Woody Allen has reached the point in his long career that his films depicting people going for master's degrees and who have sexual neurotic hangups are becoming more ridiculous. Such is the case with this utterly pointless film.Even the person who serves as the narrator appears to be bored with this entire episode.Two young girls spend the summer in Barcelona and meet a painter, played by a more subdued and romantic Lothario, Javier Bardem. One lady is going for her master's in art and is engaged to be married to Mr.Nice Guy. The other is an actress who appeared in a 12 minute film about love. Yes, 12 minutes.Both the girls soon romp with the Bardem character. He has an insanely jealous ex-wife played by Penelope Cruz. Her winning of the best supporting actress Oscar leaves me as perplexed as when Gloria Grahame won in 1952 for 'The Bad and the Beautiful.' This is totally undeserved as Cruz, as Maria Elena, comes across as a screaming lunatic.At one point Cristina, played by Scarlett Johansson, takes up with a reunited Bardem and Maria. She then has to go off to Paris for a couple of weeks to think things through. If Allen were trying to create A MENAGE A TROIS, he let a potentially funny idea go awry.When Vickie, who marries her fiancé in Barcelona, sneaks off with Bardem, she soon encounters a raging Maria, who accidentally shoots her in the hand. Imagining trying to justify to her new husband that she had met her college professor who happened to have a revolver. At least, if Allen had actually had a revolver, this idea might have worked. It doesn't because the picture is absurd.",2,2,9,20 May 2009
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Elizabeth: What's So Golden About this Royal Clinker? **
","Thoroughly boring, tedious and choppy film dealing with Queen Elizabeth. While Cate Blanchett is suited for the part, see the television version with Helen Mirren. The latter displays outstanding acting.The writing here is the major problem. History is really chopped up as Mary Queen of Scots is implicated in an assassination attempt of Elizabeth, and off goes her head as a result.Geoffrey Rush, as the queen's adviser, has the perfect role but it is squandered by a completely lack-luster performance by him. Clive Owen is appealing as Sir Walter Raleigh, but an Errol Flynn he is not.The battle scenes dealing with the Spanish Armada are brief and confusing. In addition, when Blanchett dresses up in battle gear to cheer on the troops, she is a cross between Joan of Arc and Lady Godiva.Off with their heads! I'm talking about the writers of this rather boring film. At least, the costumes were exquisite.",4,1,1,25 October 2008
Saving Mr. Banks," ****
","The Oscar winning song Chim-Chim-Charee, a spoonful of sugar and all that may have very well not come to be had the Emma Thompson character, the person who wrote Mary Poppins, had gotten her way.We have an excellent picture here of what might have not occurred. Emma Thompson gave a fabulous performance as the cantankerous, afraid of facing life author. Amazing that she was denied an Oscar nomination and I suspect that her petition signing regarding Israel had something to do with it. If that be the case, congratulations to the academy for denying it to her.The author of Mary Poppins had a difficult childhood as we observe. She saw Mary in a far different way than screen viewers eventually saw her. Tom Hanks portrayed Walt Disney in the film and he had quite a time of convincing her what Mary represented. As the alcoholic father, Colin Farrell did a great job as did Paul Giamatti, the LA chauffeur who convinces the Thompson character that life is indeed worth living.",10,0,2,7 September 2014
Speed," Speed-Wonderful Bumpy Ride ****
","If Bette Davis were alive when this marvelous action film was made, she would have certainly said to fasten your seat belts as we're in for a bumpy ride. What a wonderful bumpy ride it is. This is a fast paced, high action thriller.We have the usual lunatic mad bomber, this time played marvelously by Dennis Hopper, disgruntled and off his rocker, who plants bombs in elevators, buses and finally creates havoc on a train.Keanu Reeves is terrific as the cop who foils his plans at every turn along with Jeff Daniels. This is the latter's best film since he played the ill-fated son-in-law of Shirley MacLaine in the 1983 Oscar winner 'Terms of Endearment.'Sandra Bullock turned in a fantastic performance as the woman on the bus who winds up having to drive it under such tense circumstances.If all action films were like this.

Vicious girlfriends who do kung-fu and heroes such as Bruce Willis who come to the rescue despite the fact that their own child, alienated from them, is in danger.The special effects make this movie. Willis is as bald and vulgar as ever. His response to the villain is that he can find his wicked girlfriend at the bottom of the heap with a car up her ***.Naturally, there is a nerd in this film who is a computer hack and wanted for his services by both sides. Of course, the guy falls for Bruce's daughter. They're both kidnapped. Give me a break already. Children could write this constant script.",6,1,3,10 February 2008

","No, it's not exactly a concoction of Lucy Ricardo with Ethel Mertz.At some point, I thought I was back in college in the standard physics course reading the text Matter and Energy, or viewing Cliff Robertson's Oscar winning performance of a man who achieves genius in 1968's Charly.Scarlett sure got more than what she bargained for in this half-brain thriller regarding a woman whose new boyfriend gets her to deliver a package. He is quickly liquidated and the woman endures all sorts of torture by her Asian captives as drugs are implanted in her stomach. She also assumes tremendous intellectual power and also becomes a female Rambo in trying to extract revenge on those who implanted the drug at her.While all this is going on, Morgan Freeman lectures regarding cell development and the brain. In her travels, Scarlett eventually meets the good professor to show him the power of the drug and the 'brilliant' effects it has placed on her.This is rather inane and a better name for this film would have been 'The Terminal Lady.' This film needs termination rather quickly.",Null,2,6,12 April 2016

","The characters, especially Frances McDormand and Bill Murray, as married attorneys, are so wooden and one-dimensional.The film deals with two troubled young teens who run away and are pursued by the camp that the boy, an orphan, is attending. The girl's parents are McDormand and Murray, seemingly uncaring, cold and even hostile to the child and others.McDormand is having a secret affair with police chief Bruce Willis, the latter giving a very restrained performance for him.Even the great storm that hits is bland in comparison and a marriage scene between the two youngsters is utterly ridiculous, to say the least.The Tilda Swinton character of a really uncaring by the book social service worker needed more development.",3,2,10,24 May 2013
The Producers," Comic Farce Offset By Insensitivity **1/2
","The premise for 'The Producers' is marvelous. Two guys get a bunch of elderly women to invest in a play and look for subject matter that will be a certain flop. As the investments have gone well over 100%, there will be plenty of money for Max Bialystock (a memorable Zero Mostel) and his sidekick bookkeeper (Leo Blum), played by Gene Wilder, to keep.Max hires a transvestite director known for his failures to direct this bomb-to-be. Can anyone imagine a musical 'Springtime for Hitler,' including an opening number where June Taylor-like dancers make a swastika while singing and dancing Springtime for Hitler and Germany? This is outrageous but it works as the play turns out to be an enormous success. What's there left to do? Blow-up the theater and then face the music in court.What hurts this farce is the subject matter regarding Hitler which is definitely offensive. While I realize that the purpose was to create a sure flop, writer Mel Brooks has gone way over the top. Why not a musical on Julius Caesar? How many people would have been offended by that? I have faith in Brooks as he could have made the latter a riot as well.Kenneth Mars unfortunately is funny as 'the kraut,' the guy who authored the Hitler musical.Have Max and Leo learned anything from their experience? Not really. As jail-birds they get the inmates to invest in 'Prisoners of Love.' Aren't we really imprisoned by this utter nonsense?",6,1,4,5 February 2006

He is quite weird here and you just don't know what to expect here. Helen Mirren is just too darn lady-like to play a retired CIA agent.The film does show some spark when it's revealed that the vice president is up to his neck in this intrigue.Even the usual chase scenes can't bring much life to the movie.",6,0,3,2 March 2013
Unbroken," ****
","An extremely powerful and effective World War 11 film dealing with the life of Lou, a 1936 American athlete at the Berlin Olympics.Under impressive direction by Angelina Jolie, the film shows us his early life where he was called all sorts of derogatory terms for being Italian and how he overcame this. This and his running achievements as an athlete gave him the new found encouragement to survive treatment in a Japanese internment camp for soldiers, where brutality was common every moment with the most barbaric acts perpetrated against the prisoners. The Japanese knew they had an Olympic hero in their midst and they saved a lot of that brutality for him.His surviving was utterly amazing as he withstood plenty of torture and refused the easy way out by not participating in anti-American Japanese propaganda which would have made his stay in Japan a totally different story.A great film of determination and overcoming perils and obstacles all along the way.",10,1,2,20 October 2015

These people worked with Spielberg in the Oscar winning 'Schindler's List' and other films.Yes, the picture shows a moral dilemma. After killing many of the assassins, the Israelis are being depicted as committing atrocities as well. The writing was done by Tony Kushner, who has been a frequent critic of Israel during its forever conflict with the Palestinians.The acting is first rate. Spielberg used many unknowns along with Geoffrey Rush, who is quite effective as an Israeli agent.",7,1,9,10 June 2006

She joins in basically with a bunch of losers to form a singing group. Naturally, there is always one person who dominates by giving the orders, and it will up to Kendrick to challenge her authority. There are an assortment of characters in the group who are memorable including Fat Amy, whose real name is Fat Patricia, and an Asian girl who speaks just above a whisper.Naturally, Kendrick has problems with her father, a divorced comparative literature professor at the school.

He is on his 3rd marriage, which is troubled along with his young stepdaughter. De Niro, on the other hand, meets a nice girl, who he is ready to involve in his dishonesty, until the last moments of the film.There is much graphic violence and there is a need for a better character development.

A court martial held within a German Prisoner of War Camp during World War 11 shall possibly allow for sabotage and eventual escape.Prejudice was certainly alive and well within the armed forces during the conflict. We see how imprisoned minority officers couldn't stay with their own and the Germans viewed this with pleasure, citing the hypocrisy of the Americans- advocating liberty while pursuing prejudice.When one of the black men is killed by a racist white soldier, mayhem breaks out and when the latter is murdered, it is assumed that the black surviving soldier carried out the dastardly deed. A trial takes place with the Germans looking on with glee.Bruce Willis is terrific here as the head of the group ultimately paying the price and he is equally matched by Colin Farrell, a soldier, who serves as the attorney for the defendant despite the fact that he hasn't received his law degree as yet.",9,0,1,22 June 2015

Hoping to create chaos and killing via a cell phone, the plot is as ridiculous as his idea.Our hero, coming to the rescue, needed a far better script than what he got.

Tucci is known in the film as Dill and what a dilly he is. Both parents must think they were beyond the flower children of the 1960s.Regarding the guidance counselor affair with a 22 year old student in the school, is the message here that counselors need some sort of psychological evaluation?Awful best describes this film.",1,15,27,28 February 2012

Not only can he fast forward to the future, he can go back and just put things in stop.The movie really takes off near the end when we get the conventional theme of 'It's A Wonderful Life.' Sandler shows that he can be quite dramatic, one he sees what his life has become like due to his constantly working and really ignoring his family.Nice to see Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner as his young and aging parents. Had the second part of the movie been its entire basis, the film would have been much better. The silenced dog, hitting the boss, etc. becomes tiresome at best.

","When I first started watching the movie, I thought I had finally found the most dysfunctional family on record. Joy and her father are both divorced, but their mates are living in the basement.I was completely wrong how this picture turned out. It developed into an interesting plot where Joy, an inventor with an inquisitive mind, develops a very special mop and it shows the trials and tribulations of what she goes through to get the mop manufactured. The business family takes up her cause and she seems to face never ending obstacles, getting it manufactured, fighting with someone who has a patent claiming it's similar to what he has made, thieves in business that you can't believe, all this occurring while she is tending her nutty family, led by dad Robert de Niro, whose second wife has thrown him out.It's a story of aspirations with very hard luck and ultimate success. As joy, Jennifer Lawrence is excellent and well deserved her Oscar nomination.As the Italian widow, who takes up with dad De Niro, Isabella Rosselini was excellent in the part. She is not just a widow with tons of money, she was also a smart and alert business lady who knew how to handle her money.",9,1,3,18 October 2016

If academy voters voted such stinkers as the above films in, SLUMDOG will probably follow as a winner.The first 20 minutes of the film was absolutely disgusting and nauseating to watch. We know that we're not dealing with Park Avenue, New York City here but the scenes were a little too much to take.We do have somewhat of a good plot here- how a young man relates the questions asked of him to his earlier brutal life.We've also seen films how 2 brothers with a miserable background can go either way in life. We're also reminded of the corruption facing the quiz shows of the 1950s.",5,18,34,19 February 2009
The Nice Guys," **
","The beginning is quite confusing as is the entire plot which doesn't seem to unwind until the end of the movie. They may have been nice guys, but the film certainly isn't.An over-weight Russell Crowe plays an enforcer like guy who teams up with Ryan Gosling, a young widower with a daughter. Gosling smokes enough in the film for a life-time and is always hitting the bottle. The daughter, a precocious young teen, always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time which is good for people she saves.The story would have been better to emphasize the effects of those Michigan car emissions is smog filled Los Angeles. Instead, we have a story of a corrupt government female officer whose daughter makes a trashy film depicting what is going on in that particular industry. Everyone associated with the film is eradicated and there is enough shooting, smashing of windows and cars to last more than a life-time.",4,2,5,11 February 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," ****
","Superb film dealing with a conscientious objector becoming a war hero. No, it's not Gary Cooper in Sergeant York, but rather newcomer Andrew Garfield who gave a gut wrenching well-deserved Oscar nominated performance.From a dysfunctional family, he meets the love of his life and with the advent of World War 11, he wishes to serve as a medic but didn't realize the abuse and harassment he was in for when he went into the army and refused to touch a gun.We see military brass ready to condemn him, but yet we see sympathy for him, especially by the sergeant he later almost saved at Okinawa.Pulling the wounded survivors off the mountain was certainly a fete to be remembered. The battle scenes are gory all the way but after all, what is war?Ironically, he saves those who scorned him and earned the respect he truly deserved.",10,1,1,22 July 2017
Pocahontas," Pocahantas Gets Her Man? ***
","Wonderfully animated film, even if they distort history. Too bad the anti-Semite Mel Gibson had to play John Smith. A better role that would have been suited for that misery would have been Gov. Radcliffe.Back to the film, which is an interesting one,it depicts the basic reason for war-greed.The music is carefree and great. All sing well. As Willow, the Tree, Linda Hunt is impressive. (She usually is.)Too bad that the father's choice for Pocahantas had to catch a bullet. The way the film turned out, they really didn't have to kill him off that way. After all, we are dealing with a younger audience.",8,1,2,27 December 2008
Born on the Fourth of July," Born on the 4th of July is a Yankee Doodle Dandy of A Film ****
","No matter what you think of the political views of director Oliver Stone, he has created a masterpiece here in his Oscar winning directing of this terrific film.As Ron Kovic, Tom Cruise has never been better. The gung-ho kid who strongly believed in his country and went to war only to find out the realities of Vietnam proves Cruise's true grit in his remarkable performance. Cruise should have won the Oscar here but lost out to an excellent Daniel Day Lewis for 'My Left Foot.' Ironically, the academy generally goes for handicapped people in awarding their statues. That year, 1989, they had 2 handicapped men vying for best actor in the performances by both Cruise and Lewis.Willem DeFoe gives a sensational brief performance as an embittered Vietnam vet. The latter's wheelchair fight with Cruise is remarkably done.Besides the morality of the war, the film gives us a grim reminder of what hospital conditions were like for severely injured soldiers and the taunting that they faced when they participated in the anti-war demonstration.'Born on the 4th of July' is a riveting film depicting a very tragic era in the history of this great country.",10,0,2,29 July 2008
The Social Network," Facebook Film: College Theatrics With 2010 Technological Intellect Fails **
",I was very disappointed with this Oscar-nominated film of 2010. It basically has many of the antics of the old college films. The only difference here is the intellectual connotation due to the rise of the facebook technological theme.Jesse Eisenberg is definitely credible as facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. The film deals with the suit filed by others against Zuckerberg and his chums for allegedly stealing the facebook idea for himself.There are the many foolish college life scenes still depicted in the film.The film starts with Eisenberg talking a mile a minute on a date. It is only when he meets up with the Justin Timberlake character that he becoming a maneuvering character. The film shows some accurate traditional problems of corporate management. The problem of Eduardo is dealt with in the way you generally expect such problems to be handled.The film is not even in the class of this year's superb 'The King's Speech.',4,13,22,7 February 2011
The Pursuit of Happyness," Well, Leo Nice Guys Can Succeed -Pursuit Rates ***1/2
","Former Giant manager Leo Durocher always claimed that nice guys finished last. This movie contradicts that famous statement.The film may definitely be described as another 'Kramer vs. Kramer,' but on a very poor side.Thandie Newton continues her moody, nasty ways that she so well exhibited in 'Crash.' This time she is the frustrated wife of a wonderful guy who seems to be going nowhere very fast.The film deals with the trials and tribulations of Chris Gardner, memorably played by Will Smith. We feel the heartbreak that Smith endures as he becomes an intern as a stockbroker for Dean Whitter, and at the same time loses his wife, can't pay off his debts, sees some light under he hears from the Internal Revenue, and is forced to live in a shelter with his son, beautifully played by his real-life son Jade.This is essentially a film of the Jones's just trying to make it in a difficult urban environment. It succeeds well beyond our expectations.",9,0,0,27 March 2007
The Great Gatsby," Great Gatsby is Just That ***1/2
","With some slowness at the beginning, this is a worthwhile film on F. Scott Fitzgerald's memorable tale of the roaring 20's, the status seekers, the gaiety, the parties, prejudice, rich versus poor and eventual abandonment.As usual, Leonardo De Caprio is excellent in the title role. A status seeking man who made it to the top, Gatsby is proof in itself that money isn't everything and certainly can't always buy happiness.The 20's comes to real life with the opulent set designs.Despite trying to run away from his humble beginnings, fate brings Gatsby right back to it. It shows how the very wealthy can get away with just about anything",9,1,2,15 March 2014
The Proposal," The Proposal- Supposes That **1/2
","A wonderful premise soon evaporates into a very routine, ordinary film.Bitchy book editor, Sandra Bullock, is an absolute ogre to deal with. She fires a subordinate and then learns that as a Canadian she faces deportation for not following through on paper work. She comes up with the brilliant idea of marrying her male secretary, who has long been suffering under her management.This all sounds great but the film soon flounders when the secretary takes Bullock home to meet his family. Living in an area of Alaska, we have Craig T. Nelson who appears angry at the whole world, Mary Steenburgen, as his wife, who seems rather uncomfortable in her role and Betty White, the ex-Golden Girl, who as grandma does a native dance and feigns a heart attack to get her grandson to the airport after Bullock.The one good point is the emphasis in the movie on family togetherness. Otherwise, it's rather routine grappling with the issue of 2 people falling in love under unusual circumstances. How many times have we seen that idea before?",6,0,1,2 June 2010
Hustle & Flow," Hustle Your Way Out of this Filth *
","While Terrence Howard as Dee Jay, gives a strong Oscar nominated performance in this film, his riveting depiction of a ghetto youth's attempt to make it into rap music is hurt by the continuous vile language in the film. In short, you can't go a minute without the f word being used. It's utterly disgusting.The premise that this ghetto hustler wants a career in rap music is interesting but the film soon deteriorates into a cliché molden atmosphere of the deprivation of his people.Howard's unfortunate meeting with a rap mogul leads to tragedy, but are we really expected to think that this must be the way of ghetto life?This is not the life of Van Gogh. The latter achieved stardom after he killed himself. Dee Jay makes the grade but is in prison for murder. Perhaps, the writing should have been smoked out as well.",2,0,3,21 April 2006
Sully," ****
","Wonderful film about Capt. Sullenberger's successful landing of a plane in trouble on the Hudson River.Although immediately revered as a hero, Sully had to answer many questions from the National Transportation Safety Board, who at best were quite skeptic about his fete. They would still maintain that he didn't have to land the plane where he did.Tom Hanks is faithful to the part and I like the way the story unfolded with the actual plane incident being shown not at the very beginning of the film. Hanks was nicely supported by Aaron Eckhardt and Laura Linney gives a nice 'telephone' performance as his wife.An uplifting story with the passengers on board ready for plenty of unwelcome tense and exciting moments.",10,0,2,20 May 2017
Cinderella Man," Cinderella Man and His Princess ***12
","'Cinderella Man' beautifully captures the depression era when despair was constant and hope was nothing more than a dream. That dream is Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) who captures the character. His talk, his walk, his style in the ring are all picture-perfect. You root for they guy because he is an underdog, a caring soul who gives back his relief money when things start to turn his way.The children have that depression look about them. You feel their hunger as well as their pride for their champion-bound father.Renee Zellwegger's finest hours come midway into the picture. I found her first part to be a contrived performance, best imitating a mixture of Alice Kramden and Sally Struthers. However, when the chips are down, she can pack an emotional wallop which the picture does as well.The scenes of Hoovervilles are realistic and compelling.Paul Giamatti has been nominated for best supporting actor for his performance as Braddock's trainer. He is there all the way, especially in the fight scenes, giving much needed supported encouragement to Braddock.The film has been criticized for its depiction of Max Baer as a womanizer, and overall miserable character.The film may also promote an anti-boxing feeling given that Baer killed 2 people in the ring and seemed to get pleasure out of it. We must remember that Crowe, in the final analysis, is the real hero for fighting his way out of the depression as well as the emotional 'wallops' that he takes as well in the ring.A memorable film which is well worth the effort.",8,1,1,1 February 2006
Draft Day," ****
","Terrific Kevin Kostner film dealing with the General Manager of a football team, recently losing his father, the latter having coached the team, and when you find out why the son had fired his father from the position, you shall have a greater understanding of the film.The film goes into every intricate detail of how a manager decides who to draft for his team when the draft time comes. It is not only through actual play, but we see the human side of decision making as well. Not to be omitted is the wheeling and dealing that goes on among teams as the drafting proceeds.Jennifer Garner portrays Kostner's assistant. She knows the game well and is carrying his child. Ellen Burstyn plays his mother, a woman in the know, who shows a human element after recently losing her husband.A real gem of a film.",10,1,3,19 September 2015
The Wizard of Oz," We're Off to See the Wizard-Go,Go, Go ****
","...And to think, L. Frank Baum, the author of this classic, never lived to get the accolades that he deserved for writing such a masterpiece. The book was found by relatives go through his belongings following his death.To think, Shirley Temple couldn't get out of her contract to go to MGM. As a result, we got Judy as Dorothy. What a voice! Singing Over the Rainbow, naturally, the best song of the year.To think, that Buddy Ebsen was allergic to his costume and had to bow out of the project.To think, Gale Sondergaard, having won an Oscar 3 years before, thought that the wicked witch part was beneath. Thanks Ms. Sondergaard. You made the biggest mistake of your illustrious career. As a result, we got Margaret Hamilton and the rest is history.To think that W.C. Fields and Mae West were first considered for the roles of the Wizard and Glinda. What comedy we would have had, but much less of a movie as a result.The film is super outstanding. It is primarily for children but adults can certainly learn regarding the human frailties.Poor Dorothy, caught in that Kansas tornado with Toto too! Injured, she falls into a memorable dream and is transported to the land of Oz, filled with adventure and memories to last for a lifetime.A film to challenge our hearts and dare to dream your dreams that will come true. Some day I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Isn't it great to escape into a world of fantasy? Trouble should only melt like lemon drops upon all, not only chimney tops. Why can't I fly beyond the rainbow? See the film and get caught up in those magical moments.",10,3,4,7 March 2006
The Soloist," The Soloist Should Stay By Itself **
","Depressing film dealing with mental illness and genius. Just another of those films that press the point about genius and insanity being separated by a very fine line.Ironically, Downey Jr. takes on the Lopez role, the writer for the L.A. Times who takes an interest in a homeless, mentally ill person, who is quite talented musically.At first, one thinks that the Jamie Foxx role is one of someone being autistic. Look, he was nothing more than a homeless person, who is musically gifted but at the same time is quite a nut job.The film seems to be as erratic as Foxx's behavior. There is one scene where he looks like a character right out of James Cagney's 1942 rendition of Yankee Doodle Dandy.Following his outburst and violent scene, the uneven script has Foxx in a home and quickly improving.Films dealing with mental illness are so hard to depict on screen. A case in point was Olivia De Havilland's 1948 'The Snake Pit.' At least, you knew there why the De Havilland part cracked up. Not so in the case of this film. Unevenly told, you don't even have sympathy for the character that Foxx is trying to depict.",4,2,4,14 January 2010
The Fighter," The Fighter is TKO'D **1/2
","Despite some very good acting performances, I found this picture to be disappointing. Besides the constant foul language, it turns out to be a modern-day like 'Rocky' film with a totally dysfunctional, filthy mouthed family. In a supporting role, Christian Bale, quite effective, is like a washed-up Rocky Balboa with a drug problem. Mark Wahlberg is his brother who is trying to get it together and become a winner in the ring,something that Bale was unable to do.Melissa Leo, in an Oscar nominated performance, steals the film as the common mother, with her abusive language, constant smoking, but love of family. She is almost equally matched by Amy Adams. Adams sheds her film roles as free spirit or nun, as the foul-mouthed college drop-out girlfriend of Wahlberg.The film shows that despite the conflicts between these two ladies, who really know how to use profanity in style, all comes together for Wahlberg's opportunity for the title. Wahlberg, who surprisingly, was not Oscar nominated, delivers a riveting performance.Don't be surprised to see Bale and Leo walking down the red carpet on Oscar night. Poor Amy Adams. As in 'Doubt,' she is again facing a nominee in the same film.",6,0,5,31 January 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," Law Abiding Citizen is Anything But **1/2
","Interesting premise soon goes awfully awry. Is the father, who lost his wife and daughter in a home invasion a victim of what happened, or just a plain psychopath who was set off by what happened or was in the killing business before tragedy struck him? Remember in the opening scene, before the tragedy occurred, the man was tinkering with some device.The picture goes off as our killer not only takes revenge on those who went softly with the killers but with the public by and large. In another words, he gets the city of Philadelphia to cringe.In the role of the prosecuting attorney, Jamie Foxx exhibits a rather cool intelligence. He sees in the end that family always matters. Don't we really reach this conclusion at the end of any film?Viola Davis, as the mayor, is really getting a reputation for taking the most out of the small roles given to her. We saw this in her supporting Oscar nominated performance in 'Doubt,' and we see it again in this film. Davis takes full advantage in her brief part to show how a mayor of an urban center can take full throttle in any given situation.This movie should have been viewed as a tragedy but instead falls into the trap of dealing with psychopathic, violent behavior.",6,0,0,11 August 2010
Up in the Air," Up in the Air Hits Cloud Nine ****
","Something very different has hit the movie screen and it's 'Up in the Air.'What an appropriate film to deal with how people are directly affected when they lose their jobs. This is about the best movie role that George Clooney has ever had. In a part that would have been Cary Grant's years ago, Clooney plays a suave guy who goes around telling people that they've lost their jobs. After doing this for so long, he has become immune to their responses, and frankly, he couldn't care less.When his life-style is threatened by a newcomer to the firm, he brings her along to show her how he does his job.Of course, the best part of the job is the rude awakening that he faces by the woman he has chosen to play around with.Clooney's vulnerability and indifference to others is extraordinarily done. To say that he is callous earlier in the film, that's putting it mildly. Some would say that he got what he deserved by acting in the way he does.This picture is destined to become a part of Americana, especially if the economy doesn't turn around soon. It definitely serves as a wake-up call.",10,2,8,23 December 2009
From Here to Eternity," From Here to Eternally Good ****
","This anti-war movie was proclaimed the best picture of 1953, deservedly so.Montgomery Clift is the anti-hero Pruitt. This man is ready to take anything or anyone on.Frank Sinatra, as Maggio, is also anti-hero. Both of our friends are in one scrap after another.Deborah Kerr is unhappily married and begins a relationship with Commander Burt Lancaster. Their steamy scene on the beach is absolutely memorable, quite controversial for 1953.Then, of course, there is Donna Reed, who as Clift's girl friend, was named best supporting actress of the year. With the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Clift, who had gone AWOL, wants to return to his unit. Reed utters those immortal words: 'What did the army ever do for you?' Of course, he returns and is promptly shot. Everyone on the base is naturally upset after the bombing-it's shoot first and ask questions later.The film basically concerns itself with an army unit boxing tournament. One of our heroes will not box for his unit and as a result suffers for it. Of course, it is Deborah Kerr's miserable husband who gives the guy an awful a lot of problems for refusing to do so. An investigation after the Pearl Harbor bombing will drive him from the service.Sinatra, in his best supporting Oscar performance, fights with a bull-dog played viciously by Ernest Borgnine. When Sinatra winds up later in the stockade, Borgnine is in charge and beats Sinatra to death. Clift responds to this by stabbing Borgnine to death in a back alley. That's when he became AWOL.It is amazing that this anti-war, anti-army film was voted for best picture. Sure, it deserved the award but we're talking about 1953-the McCarthy era. Belated congratulations to the Motion Picture Academy for their fine choice which probably irked McCarthy. This film was certainly one of the best anti-war films ever made. It really delved into the military pointing out a very ugly side of it. The picture received 5 acting nominations, Lancaster, Clift, Kerr, Sinatra and Reed.",10,0,2,16 January 2006
Atonement," Thou Shall Atone For Your Sins, How About this Picture?
","A young girl's lie forever alters the destiny of her sister and the latter's boy friend. This is what we are told in the advertising for the best picture nominee of 2007-'Atonement.'The director should atone for giving us this kind of picture. We are dealing with nothing more than a little brat who accused her sister's boy friend of molesting a younger cousin of theirs.The story would have been far more exciting if the class angle issue would have been emphasized instead. The lad accused of the molestation was the son of a cook in the house. Despite his education and ambition to become a doctor, no one believed him, probably because of class distinction, and as a result he suffered imprisonment.The picture alternately fast forwards and goes back to make its point.The ending is most shocking, when some 40+ years later, the girl is now an elderly woman, portrayed by the venerable hag Vanessa Redgrave. As a child, Briony loved to write and it was probably her precocious attitude that stirred her imagination. Redgrave admits to the fact that the book that she has written was a take off on the lives of the young man and her sister, both of whom, really had died during World War 11. She is atoning for her sin in writing the book of how their lives should have been.Of all people to play a person atoning for her sins, Vanessa Redgrave! That witch should be atoning for her 1978 presence at the Oscars, when after winning for best supporting actress in 'Julia,' she delivered her diatribe against Zionism. Practice what you preach Vanessa and atone for first things first.As for the movie, it is an utterly boring and is so slow paced, that it could have been told in half an hour.",5,2,10,19 March 2008

","2018 and England is in the midst of a dictatorship by a crackpot who has brought death to 100,000 people by unleashing a virus and then blaming a dissident group for doing this.Natalie Portman, a gifted actress, stars in this mess. The film has a good premise with a totalitarian regime in England while the U.S. is having a civil war. It soon falls apart as the bodies begin to pile up. The man with the mask begins to bring revenge on all those who concocted the virus.The film is even a little bit silly and the ending is totally ridiculous.There is one good performance and that is by John Hurt as the lunatic ruler. Stephen Rea, who was so good in 'The Crying Game,' plays a police officer who is trying to capture the terrorist with the mask.Portman looks like she has boozed, drugged and been through the mill. Unwittingly, she becomes an accessory to the masked man. When she denounces him, he imprisons her and then releases her. Along the way, we find out that her young brother was a victim of the virus and her parents were executed for their anti-government activities.Stop with the nonsense. Too much of the film is all so predictable. I upped the rating to **1/2 because of the premise of the film, but that's about it.",6,8,16,20 May 2007

","Somewhat funny Will Ferrell effort. This time around, Will stars as the head of a basketball team who is some terrific promoter. He engages in all sorts of odd eccentricities to get the fans in.The fun starts when his ABA league is going to merge with the NBA, but the latter will only take the 4 best teams. Ferrell hires cast off Woody Harrelson to play but Harrelson soon takes over the coaching efforts of the team. What publicity Ferrell puts himself through to get the fans to come to games.Even while his Flint Michigan team is soaring in the standings, the Commissioner and others have decided that Flint is not a big drawing crowd city so the franchise will terminate at the end of the season.Naturally, this doesn't get the team down and the film ends with some wily maneuvers by the team to get that 4th spot.The film has fun moments but is highly predictable.",5,0,0,4 April 2009

","Putrid best describes this 2015 film. The plot is stated in one line and for all purposes, it is quickly forgotten as the film is 100% action packed with never ending sequences of fighting, cars flying through the air, shootings, house explosions, car chases, man versus man and woman versus woman in endless fights. It's just too much to see in nearly 2:15 that the film takes to unravel.As a result of all this, the characters can never be fully realized. They are basically people caught up in this very warfare enduring throughout the film.The film becomes tedious because you want more character interaction other than what I have described above.",1,8,64,30 April 2016
