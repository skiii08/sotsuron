Requiem for a Dream," 10
","In a few words: A beautifully disturbing film that vividly outlines the emotions of four people that strive to find happiness. There are ~2500 voters who gave this movie 1/10. This is not surprising as many people go to the movies or rent a DVD just to kill some time by watching a movie that won't challenge their minds. This doesn't mean that Requiem for a Dream is hard to understand nor that it contains any big, hard to predict, surprises. Nonetheless, Requiem for a dream is not just another movie about drugs, in my opinion the drug use depicted in this film is just a framework that helps to the exposure of the characters and to intensify their problems and emotions. The essence of the film lies within the colourful portrayal of the characters that succumb to their problems and insecurities that finally drive them to desperation.An absolute must see.",10,2,4,29 January 2007
Dawn of the Dead," bad, really really bad!
","I do not understand why this movie has a 7.4 average user rating.There are no words to describe how bad this movie is, but here are a few key reasons of why I think this:<ul><li>The acting is TERRIBLE - Many of the dialogues are just retarded - There is NO character development - The plot is very simple and in many cases it just doesn't make sense - The filming is un-original - The special FX, and this is the least of all, are B-movie grade</li></ul>in fact the whole production is B-movie grade. There is absolutely nothing in that film that is worth watching. instead of leaving the original movie to rest in peace they created a 'zombie' compared to what the original was IN ITS TIME.",3,1,4,9 December 2007
Avatar," in a nutshell
",I only have four words to say reallyOH MY F**ING GOD!oh and the 3d is just the final touch to complement the experience just as a beautiful and sexy lingerie complements a divine body...HOLY MOTHER OF MOSES! AND ALL THE BIBLICAL CHARACTERS AND DEITIES EVER IMPROVISED BY HUMANS!Don't expect to read any plot summaries here. That would be pointless. This is a classical story taken a step further. Just stop reading silly reviews and go watch it fool!P.S. Apparently there is a longer version waiting to be released on Blu-ray. I can't wait...,10,38,65,22 January 2010
