It," Wasn't that bad at all
","I was originally worried when they mentioned the remake of 'IT', considering the book is one of my favorites from Stephen King, and the 1990 mini-series was cool (at the time).Have to admit though, this remake was alright (and I have seen some horrible ones in the last couple of years). The best part of this remake was Skarsgard who played Pennywise almost exactly how I had envisioned him when I read the book. While I loved Tim Curry, who made Pennywise evil, if not a little fun, Skarsgard made Pennywise seem deranged/psychotic/creepy. The movie itself was slow in some areas, but I chalk it up to character development of the kids, especially since this is just part 1. Still doesn't quite follow the book, but more so than the 1990 version.Cheers",7,1,1,1 December 2017
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Action and fun yes, history no
","So I just finished watching this movie and I have to say that I liked it! No, its wasn't the visual, factual Abe Lincoln, but who cares! Alright, I guess if you are a history buff and WANT actual events, then you are better off watching 'Lincoln' which I heard was pretty good as well.So, based on events when he was a child, Abe becomes a vampire hunter and a pretty darn good one a that and, based on past friendships, he becomes the man we all know and love today (equality makes anyone a friend in my book). Rufus Sewell plays the villain well (love him in most of his roles since Dark City) and Benjamin Walker wasn't bad (loved the ax-welding bit!) either. Supporting cast also did a good job.On a whole the movie was good as long as you like action, Rufus, and vampires (raises hand right here :D), not so much if you like history (drops hand).Cheers!!",7,2,4,20 December 2012
Split," I enjoyed it
","Hello 'Split'. I was glad to see M. Night returning back to what made me like his movies in the first place. While the end did not have the twists of Unbreakable or Sixth Sense, the build up of characters and the suspense of the situation made it a good watch.So I learned long ago that sometimes people just don't get a movie, the context behind it, why the characters behave such and such, and instead just write it off as stupid. A lot of the negativity I read in reviews (after I watched the movie of course) were made by people not understanding, or just didn't take the time to understand that the lead girl behaved the way she did because of what happened to her, the other girls were not 'dumb, slow, twittering idiots' but actually did try to rescue themselves. And they WERE teenagers, so of course they wouldn't be expecting anyone other than dad to be around. I can say quite easily that when I was a teenager it was all about getting good grades, hanging with friends, and living in our own bubble.Anyhoo, I liked this movie. There is very little in terms of blood, guts and gore, so if that is what you are expecting, move on. McAvoy was fantastic as the antagonist and made you believer in multiple personalities. Taylor-Joy was also very believable as our damaged heroine. In the end, watch it for yourself. If you liked Shyamalan back in the day I think you will like this one.",8,3,8,27 May 2017
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Bubble bubble, toil and trouble.....
","I've always been a fan of the Grimm Fairy Tales being done exactly how they were supposed to be done: dark, foreboding, action packed, not cutsie. As with the others, 'Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters' delivers. The action itself is fast paced, starting from the demise of the very first witch to the destruction of the coven and future witches, an actual thrill a minute. Of course the 3D effects were also great, adding to the overall feel of the movie.However the downside was that the movie lacked character development. Yes, we saw the real reason why they were left in the woods. And it did sort of explain their 'hidden assets' which made them good hunters, but I actually found myself rooting for Muriel (head witch played by the Famke Janssen) half of the time. But then again that could be my warped mind...In the end I gave this movie a 7/10. I'd watch it again, just not in the theater again.",7,2,4,30 January 2013
Evil Dead," Different... that's all we can say..
","OK, i'm not gonna give it the lowest rating. Instead I gave it a 5/10 just because I did jump once. If you've watched the original Evil Dead, you will quickly realize its not the same campy, tongue-in-cheek horror that we all came to love. Instead, this film was supposed to be a more serious horror (as per directors words). While they did indeed retain the creepy camera movement thru the woods (when demons were summoned) and the necronomicon, little else remained. Ash has been replaced by a drug addict woman and jock Scott has been replaced by hippie-looking Eric. Also 2 of the characters are brother and sister.This film did delve into the occult a little more than the original, but the exorbitant amount of expletives uttered throughout the movie was a complete turn off, and I definitely missed the 'we're gonna get you' lullaby sung by Linda.All in all, the movie was sort of OK but I miss the hilarity. And of course the movie would have been even better with a cameo from Bruce 'Ash' Campbell!! Cheers",5,2,4,10 August 2013
The Conjuring," Creepy and I liked it!!
","The summary above pretty much sums it all. I liked it. No sex, no gory flailing of flesh bits and pieces or buckets upon buckets of blood. And the best of all, no expletives (or rather very little). The Conjuring gives a brilliant performance on the merit of its actors, musical score (which wasn't bad), and landscaping.The movie reminds me a little of Amityville Horror in days of old. We have a nice family moving into a house where atrocities occurred in the past. Soon the demonic spirit(s) starts taking over. Suspense, thriller, heart palpitations for what's to come are all the signs of a good horror.Wan has done well again. I fully enjoyed Saw (the original. the sequels got more ridiculous as they went on) and Insidious. All in all i'd fully recommend this movie.Cheers",8,0,2,9 August 2013
