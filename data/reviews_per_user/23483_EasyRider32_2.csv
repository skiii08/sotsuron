The Ring," Very poorly done, Not even a hint of scary
","This movie could not even come close to the comparison of the 6th Sense. The 6th Sense was very well done, had a story line which kept you in suspense.  The Ring was like a cheesy attempt at making a suspense horror film.  The events did not even blend well, nor were the PG13 rated `scary' scenes.  Perhaps if the movie were changed to a Rated R movie with extreme violence and gore; at least it would have the elements of a cheesy no plot horror flick which is at least entertaining to watch.",1,3,9,20 April 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Overall entertaining, but far from the quality of T2
","I thought the movie kept its traditional sci fi action appeal.  However the story was a little weak, there could have been more story lines in between the action.  Also the action was tamed down to a PG level,  What happend to the good old days back in the 80s with the maxium blood gore and vilolence R-Rated all the way.    I give this film a 7/10",7,0,0,2 July 2003
