Black Swan," Darren Aronofsky plays it non-stop
","If anything must be said about 'Black Swan', is that it keeps a high note throughout its length: it is engrossing, bold, and simultaneously seamless. It is definitely one of my favorites from last year.I won't waste time with plot line, as the information abounds here on IMDb, but this is a movie that will leave a long term impression on me. It is dramatic and beautiful, conveying grand themes of betrayal, selfishness and sacrifice.Sad as I was to realize Mila Kunis has too small of a role, Natalie Portman carries itself to another level with this performance. She is irrecognizable and is able of conveying the slightest feelings.The greatest awards however are due in direction. Forget Fincher, this is Aranofsky year. This movie would never work in any other hands, because if one scene had failed, the ensemble would be nothing as it is.Extraordinary achievement.9/10(and only because, for a 10, I need to see it again).",9,1,3,12 January 2011
In Bruges," Little Gem
","I must start this review by stating that even tough I love the big, epic, genre-defining, multi-million dollar, all time and all new classics, my greatest pleasure in cinema is to stumble upon the little movie. Not little on budget(even if it happens to be true many times), but a movie that is restrained in scale, that has but a few characters and a simple premise; a movie that expects nothing of itself but to be what it is. In one word: SIMPLICITY!If you read Tolstoy, you soon realize that in his writing the biggest remarks on human nature are expressed in the most beautifully simplified verse. It holds true to all arts that, through simplicity and showing nothing more than a detail, you get a more accurate display of life.'In Bruges' is such a gem. Perfect as it is. Shot in the beautiful city of Bruges, to which we are introduced by some of the most beautiful(and some times hilarious) footage I have ever seen-one where a dog looks from the window to the street like an old lady burns into the memory fast. The acting, as it always happens in such small movies, is what carries the film. Great acting all around with the grand prize going to Colin Farell who seems to be on top form after giving up alcohol. A very nuanced performance from a truly great actor.Overall, this is the most enjoyment I have taken from cinema this year. Fun, layered, meaningful and a treat to the eyes.8/10",8,1,3,1 November 2008
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," A sword of two edges: a balanced review
","Prince of Persia is one of the few games that have an interesting enough plot to turn into a movie. Another example is the successful Resident Evil, which is an interesting twist on the zombie genre.This movie uses those interesting narrative points well enough to make it an engaging, entertaining movie. The directing is effective, as is the acting(whatever the hell Ebert was complaining about, I missed it) and the visuals are incredibly well done. I feel I must however explain what well done means to me: it doesn't mean an impossible world with good textures and a lot of camera gimmicks, like that of Avatar, but rather a plausible world where CGI is invisible enough to make one not think about it while enjoying the picture.Now that the good is out of the way, let me say the rest: it is not a brilliant, one of a kind movie. It uses narrative devices that we've seen over and over and it abandons character and narrative development too many times to replace it for action. And while I'd say much of the action is high quality and many people crave for it, in this case I felt the movie could have offered more, had it not been so divided between its story and the violent entries,far too easy to insert in such a tale.Overall, I was entertained and highly appreciated the visuals(very true to the games). However, I felt more of an emotional impact in the end of the 2008 Prince of Persia game than I did at any point in the movie.7/10",7,6,9,12 June 2010
Knocked Up," The way comedies are
","In the land of Hollywood, good and worthwhile comedies seem hard to produce, but watching Appatow's serial comedy hits after resisting watching them for a long time makes me wonder why that is.Appatow does comedies that have two things that seem simple enough to get: an working concept and character driven comedy. Not mindless gags of fart and sex(even tough they're also included), but instead a free for all tale of people that slide over a very earthly subject-in this case, unplanned pregnancy-with a light treatment where depression and pessimist will not have their way. Where the mood should be serious, Appatow takes it maturely in an amusing way. Where the mood should be goofy, he shocks us by making us realize there's more than just funny under the hood of his films. Seth Rogen may look fat and hopeless in this movie, but Appatow will never let him be shrug of as a nuisance to be done with. Ever since 'Freaks and Geeks' he shows us that everyone has problems, but no one has unique problems; he wants to tell us that we all swim in the same pool, even if at different depths in different times. For that alone, his movies will always be gold in my book.",8,0,0,5 April 2010
Shutter Island," Shutter Island ranks highly
","Martin Scorcese finally gives us an original movie where creativity roams free. Well, maybe its not the most inventive of movies, but Scorcese's mastery in joining detective story, film noir, thriller and horror should suffice to make Shutter Island one of this year's highlights.Leonardo DiCaprio is maturing as an actor and even tough he will probably never reach the acting heights of Pacino, Brando, Ledger or Sellers, he is improving as a leading man and is work is seamless with the tale.The photography is beautiful and the writing manages to keep us guessing exactly how this chair game will end.Shutter Island is an oasis in a desert.",9,2,7,23 May 2010
Watchmen," Not bad...as long as you haven't read the novel.
","'The Watchmen' is a movie adaptation of what many consider to be the best graphic novel of all time. The differences in mediums immediately makes this process extremely difficult, but also makes the comparisons become somewhat less important. A movie must not be compared with a book even if they share so much in common and as such it must be said that 'The Watchmen', while a failed adaptation, is an above average movie that presents the story in a comprehensible and maybe even in an enjoyable way.Unfortunately, this reviewer has read the novel. This reviewer also noticed from the very beginning that the director wanted to be faithful to the book. Scene after scene we are shown animated copies of the book, dialog included. Impressive from a technical point of view that they are able to reproduce all that wonderful and rich imagery. The problems however became apparent soon after. Even if most of the scenes follow the book, that becomes irrelevant since so much of what adds the book its value is missing from the movie. Furthermore, the movie's visuals, even if impressive, didn't require any creative input from the crew since they are copies. All the creativity of value is mostly technical. Worse, the few creative changes that are seen in the movie are all in the purpose of showing more violence or sex or whatever commonplace sentimentality feelings they want the characters to express.In the end, 'The Watchmen' is a good movie, but mostly because it doesn't stray from the novel much and has some of it's value. If you want the full vision and experience, then you're going to have to read the novel.Snyder may have pulled '300' off, but 'The Watchmen' required a more thoughtful approach on adaptation; decisions and choices would have to be made so that, instead of keeping the visuals, the movie could have kept the ideas and feelings of the novel.7/10. Good movie. Terrible adaptation.",7,0,1,3 July 2009
The Thing," John Carpenter's Masterpiece from another world
","As the ending credits appeared on screen of my TV after watching 'The thing' on DVD for the first time(knowing very little about it), I just sat silently and whispered to myself more 'wows' than I have my whole life.Some people will call this a horror movie, but I politely disagree. Even tough elements of horror run throughout the movie, 'The thing' can only fall under the sci-fi genre. And not only is this sci-fi, it is sci-fi as you will have trouble finding- the purest of its siblings. There is not one unreal symbolic character development like you find in so many other movies; the characters evolve with the movie and there is absolutely no moment where the action stops in preparation of the next THRILLING moment- it is always thrilling, endlessly running the beautiful images and sounds and effortlessly building the story without flaw in your mind.The acting and directing, as well as all the other technical areas, work so well they're not even noticed. Kurt Russel delivers a terrific performance worthy of mention.When watching 'The thing' it is hard to try outguessing it, not just because it will surprise you in every corner, but more importantly because you will be sucked into that world and be too impressed by it's wonders to think about anything else.I give it a 9/10 and a top 5 in my all time favorites list.",9,1,2,28 July 2008
Warrior," On the hall of fame of sports movie
","The warrior feels like a different sports film from the beginning. It's the movie that 'The Fighter'(2010) tried to be and fell short of being: a truly great sports movie with real family drama behind it.Although everyone plays their part beautifully, it is Tom Hardy that makes himself shine with an amazing performance of a very contrived character. The script and directing manage to conceal the character from the viewer until that(inevitable) final fight, where so little is said in words and so much is communicated through the punches.I don't want to spoil anything. Just go see it, you won't regret it.9/10",9,0,1,17 February 2012
Salt," For what it is, it's great fun.
","Salt is filled with ridiculous ideas, plot holes the size of the sun, and completely overblown action. So, is it worth you time? If you can accept it for what it is, a vehicle for action, then it absolutely is.Its a movie that is honest with itself; it doesn't try to be something that it isn't. If, for example, the characters had been developed beyond the shallow point in which they are, then it might have been impossible to appreciate the film. But the film never pretends to be more than a vehicle for ridiculous action and as such, it works.Angelina Jolie is effective, but her efforts again play against the silliness of the film.Comparisons with Bourne are inevitable(especially the end scene), but this is a silly movie for the silly season, and as such, it compares favorably to the rest of the drivel.",6,1,4,21 August 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Overyhyped, but will be loved by many
","I love film. I watch many films, many genres, from the most experimental to the most formulaic. And good or bad, I always enjoy the experience, because most movies, whether they execute their ideas well or not, revolve around some aspect of the human experience. No matter how fantastical its world or characters might be, there are always anchors to reality; usually a theme central to the human experience: love, war, despair, happiness, depression, hopes and dreams, regret, etc.I also love videogames for the experience that they offer. They are fun and engaging, and they can be a fun social experience in the right amount. And although narrative wise they usually don't offer much, that has been changing the past few years.Why this introduction in a review? Because 'Scott Pilgrim vs the World' offers none of what is great about film and none of what is great about gaming. It's like a video game you don't get to play. It is, in one word, boring. I actually had to turn it off the first time, because I was bored out of my mind. The second time I watched it in full, but I didn't enjoy it.It is a technically well made movie and it has some solid acting, but not only is the script completely devoid of anything interesting, other than childish word play and the regular sarcastic jokes that are so overplayed these days, but it actually doesn't even has a finished story. There is nothing behind it and the characters are so limited in their interactions that they don't even feel like people. They feel like characters in a video game, but since I'm not playing it, I don't care what happens to them.This is a flashy movie, that moves fast and will please a lot of(young) people, but that ultimately offers nothing to dwell on or appreciate.I rarely give any move less than a 6 rating, but for sheer boredom and mind numbing action, I give this a 5, and only because I love Edgar Wright's earlier work and hope he will get back on track.",5,6,13,6 January 2011
Alice in Wonderland," Alice in Wonderland is stunning to look act, but gives up on itself
","Alice in Wonderland has always been a bit of an adult imaginary world that adults pretend to be for children. Its an eerie creation and Burton had his heart set right with the tone of the film and its spectacular visuals, which are beautifully and cleverly designed.Sadly, the film's initial hour promises much more than what we are offered in the end-predictable action and character resolution in fast mode. It seems as though they just gave up on the story and decided to finish it loud and fast, which is shameful as the movie gets so many things right.In all honesty, had I seen this film as a child I would have loved it and found it extraordinary. In my sadly judgmental maturity, I can't stop but feel this was a missed opportunity.Depp is great and Mia Wasikowska is a pleasant surprise.",7,0,1,31 May 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," Great fun, even for adults
","Here's an animated movie that has everything it should have, an inspired, but simple story without jokes intended for the adult parents who have to sit with their kids in the theater. In 'How to train a dragon', it is the majestic artwork that keeps the viewer engaged, with a mix of funny, colored characters and a less heavy handed screenplay than those of pixar. In some ways that should detract from the movie, but somehow it all works into great fun that takes a grown man back to the fun of childhood.Simple, beautiful and a lot of fun.8/10",8,15,20,2 January 2011
Man on Fire," Hard to dislike, impossible to love
","In the realm of film and other assorted arts, its rare to find a piece that propels a conflicting feeling. Usually you like or dislike something, with varying degrees of each, but 'Man on Fire' excels in its beautiful direction, acting, photography and then falls face down into mediocrity when it comes to script and plot.If feels almost a waste that such a beautiful work offers little more than the cheap thrill of a vengeful chase. Its purported intelligent twist, which I guessed with certainty past one hour of its 2:30 running time, is nothing if not the old Hollywood compulsion of tying up all the knots and leave people safely satisfied.Another reviewer on IMDb states this is a violent film and that it ignores 30 years of social blablabla, but the only violence in this film(other than the cartoonish deaths and bullet wounds), is the ease on which they turn the very serious issue of kidnapping into a thrill ride, all the while pretending they are serious in their approach.This movie has a lot of good things in it(Denzel is top form in this one), and there are far worse offerings, but it really only works in the shallowest of ways.How this has a 7.7 rating in this site is beyond me.PS: for a truly good film on vengeace, try 'Oldboy'.",6,1,2,7 October 2010
Inception," Nolan is a master now.
","Upon reviewing the 'Dark knight' I had said that a director such as Nolan was being wasted in Batman sequels, regardless of their quality. And that was because Nolan is one the few directors in Hollywood able to create something truly original and as such should not be adding branches to fully grown trees.'Inception' proves the validity of my claim, but it does so in ways that surprised me.Perhaps the most immediate distinction between 'Inception' and the 'Dark Knight' is an improved sense of pacing. It doesn't feel like narrative put in a blender like the batman movie did: despite its scope, each scene is warranted plenty of time and the use of more traditional associative cuts allow it to flow better.The movie itself is difficult to describe,which is a non-issue because it requires itself to be experienced to be understood.Another area Nolan seems to be grasping is in directing actors: I always liked Leonardo DiCaprio, but his mannerisms at times can be the thing obstructing a good actor from becoming great. In 'Inception', all his mannerisms are gone and this is finest performance ever.The special effects are incredibly well done, which means they don't look like CGI, even when they are. However, one of its greatest technical achievements is the sound editing, perfectly balancing the several momentums of the scenes.Wishing to provide no spoilers at all, I'll just say it isn't nearly as complicated as some have named it, but it is a complex concept.I cannot compliment this movie enough. It is the most engaging film experience I have had in a long, long, long time. My advice is don't miss it in the theaters. Don't miss it when it come to DVD. Don't miss it any chance you get.You won't regret it.",10,8,17,17 August 2010
Halloween," He's gonna get you!
","Rare movies create sub-genres and this is one of them.John Carpenter's Halloween created a new sub-genre of horror, later named slasher movies and regardless of the fact that dozens of films can today be cataloged under this genre, the original slasher is still the best. The sequels and imitators are mainly studio movies intended to extract as much money as possible from the formula for which this movie serves as model.Carpenter's second best direction effort(the best being 'The Thing') is an amazing horror movie from 1978 that will scare even the youngest audiences that have gone through many of the new slasher trends. The way many of the scenes are shot make the audience feel like a voyeur standing beside Meyers and alternates to the victims when they're about to be killed, trying to make the viewer as uncomfortable and out of balance as possible.The acting is not brilliant, but competent; Jamie Lee Curtis begins her career in this movie and played Laurie Strode.Halloween is one of the best horror movies of all time and remains groundbreaking despite the repetitive use of many parts of it's plot by other less good industry products.I give this an 8/10 and second in my all time favorite horror list.",8,0,1,29 July 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," Beautiful movie
","I have a mental top 20 list that has changed many times throughout the years, but I think Slumdog will forever have a spot in that list and in my heart.So little romantic movies with a serious intention are made this days, that when something like this hits, it's hard not to fall in love.Danny Boyle is said to have directed masterpieces, but only now will I accept to recognize him as one of the best directors working today. This movie is a wonder to look at, painful to watch at times and in the end of the most rewarding experiences I have ever experienced with film.10/10 and best film of the year without any competition.",10,1,4,5 January 2009
