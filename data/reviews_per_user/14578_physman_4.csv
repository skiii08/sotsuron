Walk the Line," Met My Expectations
","What you see in the trailer is what you get in the movie: a story you've seen, read, or heard hundreds of times before. A celebrity overcomes adversity, can't handle success, nearly destroys his life through substance abuse, and finds redemption in the end.The hook in that tired old story that this movie offers is Johnny Cash's unique musical and vocal style. On that front, director James Mangold ('Kate and Leopold') makes a mistake by having Joaquin Phoenix do his own singing. A big part of Cash's appeal stems from his amazing deep bass voice. Not one male singer in 1,000 has the low notes Cash had, and -- surprise, surprise -- Phoenix isn't that one. It would have been so easy to find a good Cash imitator to dub the songs, but because they let Phoenix do the singing, the audience is left wondering how this guy ever sold a single record, let alone millions. The big audition scene is simply an embarrassment; there is no way any record producer in the world would have touched Cash with a ten-foot pole if he'd sung 'Folsom Prison Blues' with the mediocre sound Phoenix produces.(Reese Witherspoon, on the other hand, pulls off her musical numbers with a nice voice and real country music style.)Another shortcoming of Walk the Line -- and here the movie's trailer is misleading -- is the lack of a credible love story. There's very little romantic chemistry between Phoenix's Cash and Witherspoon's June Carter, but that's the fault of the script rather than the actors. Cash is such a worthless human being through most of the movie that it's impossible for Carter to see anything in him. When she tells a drugged-out Cash that he's a good person, our reaction can only be 'He is?' In the bizarre marriage proposal scene at the end, she agrees to marry him not out of love, but apparently out of embarrassment.Even with those negatives, the movie is slickly made, features some fine performances by the lead and supporting actors, and has several good concert scenes. If you're looking for something unique or thought-provoking, skip it. But if you're in the mood for a dramatized E! True Hollywood Story, this one fits the bill.",6,1,3,17 April 2006
The Village," Another fine suspense movie from Shyamalan
","The powerful human element in The Village makes this so much more than a good Twilight Zone episode. Shyamalan and his terrific cast make you care about the residents of the village -- not just their fear of the menace surrounding them, but also the tragedies, heartache, and joys they experience in their everyday lives. Especially compelling are the younger generation of villagers, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, and Adrien Brody. (The village 'elders', led by William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver, are a little less developed.) Add these powerful characters to the expected Shyamalan elements -- intriguing plot twists (plural), gripping cinematography, and a haunting musical score -- and you have another hit by the best maker of suspense films working today.",8,0,1,17 July 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Short and Padded
","'Good Night and Good Luck' isn't a bad movie, but it's certainly an over-hyped one. There simply isn't much to it. At 93 minutes, it is surely one of the shortest Oscar-nominated films of recent times. So what, you say -- a movie can cover a lot in an hour and a half if the script is tight. That's true, but this has to be one of the least tight scripts I've seen put on film. At least thirty of the 93 minutes is blatant filler. There are several musical montages that do little to advance the plot (one is a pure music video with no plot whatsoever). And there's an uninteresting subplot about the relationship between Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson that serves no purpose other than to pad the movie's running time. What's left is the material of an hour-long History Channel show, except the History Channel wouldn't have such cartoonish portrayals of the heroes and villains of the story. Granted, the History Channel also wouldn't have the cool black-and-white cinematography, or the interesting period details like Murrow using cigarettes as props in his newscasts. But there are plenty of movies that have interesting images and also manage to include involving plots and three-dimensional characters. Rent one of those and skip this one.",5,1,3,2 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Better than the previous two....how?
","The refrain we've heard from every review of this movie is that at least it's better than Episodes I and II. Uh, how exactly is it better? Like I and II, this one suffers from cringe-worthy dialog (I was especially embarrassed for James Earl Jones during his few lines), wooden acting, uneven pacing, and nonsensical plot elements. In addition, because we know almost every detail of what's going to happen to every character, there isn't even the tiniest element of surprise in plot direction that we might have had in the first two prequels.Given the resources, and the genuine greatness of Empire Strikes Back, it boggles the mind that Lucas and his team could have made three movies as bad as I, II, and III. What I've said about the first two applies even more to Revenge of the Sith: This is the kind of movie Ed Wood would have made if he had an unlimited budget.",2,3,6,3 July 2005
