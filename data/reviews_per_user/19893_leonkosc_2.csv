The Equalizer," Too long, man
","So I watched this movie, 'couse becouse of christmas I have some free time and I just wanted to watch good, simple action movie to relax.My problem with The Equalizer is the fact that it's over two hours long and that's way too much, becouse the plot is very simple. Hour and a half would be just fine but it feels just way to long.Action scenes are fine. They're not nearly as good as fight scenes in John Wick, but they're fine. My problem is that they were too dark and it wasn't always clear what's happening.I really liked the actors. - Denzel Washington was good, but Chloe Moretz stole every scene she was in. She was as great as usually.
The other thing that was missing for me was some humor, but it's not a big flow.Overall it's okey. If you haven't seen John Wick, or new Mission Impossible movies, or A Man From U. N. C. L. E. I recomend any of those over The Equalizer but if you have and you like action movies. - It'll do alright.",5,0,2,23 December 2018
The Greatest Showman," Ok show, weak showman
","Well I gotta be honest - I'm not the biggest musical fan out there, but my favorite piece of art right now is Hamilton and becouse of that I decided to watch some of the most popular musicals of last few years.I kinda like the style of it. I mean CGI's terrible, but I thought the sets were beautiful as well as the costumes. And I gotta say - almost all of the songs were very good. Almost, becouse the second song (can't remember the name) was too long and I really don't like This Is Me. It just really didn't fit in this part of the movie, it was just a distraction from what was going on with Hugh Jackman's character.Hugh Jackman is awesome, as well as every actor and actress - Zandaya was a little bit wasted for me (she only appered in few scenes) but she was incredible in all of them. And it's always nice to see Zack Efron in something that's not crappy comedy.But me main problem is the fact that Hugh Jackman's character starts as a good, simple man, than becomes an opsessed with power dick... And than becomes a good person again. Why? Wouldnt it be more interesting to see him leave his family and becoming 'the greatest showman'. It felt to family movie like which isnt a bad thing but for me it didn't fit in this story or this idea.",4,0,0,31 March 2019
