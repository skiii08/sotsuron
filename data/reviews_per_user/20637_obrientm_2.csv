The Rock," my favorite movie
","the rock has to be my favorite movie. it has an excellent plot, and fine acting with some of my favorite actors including michael biehn, ed harris, david morse, and john c. mcginley. i would have to say that michael biehn's character, commander anderson, was easily my favorite character, even though he had little screen time. i felt that the scene in the shower room was very powerful, and that it made the navy seals look like true heroes. i liked how harris's and morse's characters became the heroes at the end.",Null,1,1,3 June 2001
Jurassic Park," fierce competition for the greatest movie ever
","when jurassic park came out as a movie, i had my doubts. crichton's work was simply amazing, and i felt that it would be hard to duplicate. when i first saw the movie, i was disappointed. it did not follow crichton's plot line, and my favorite character, robert muldoon, was greatly altered and killed in the movie. but when i went back to watch it again, i began to like it. i saw it as a twisted jurassic park story, and i began to appreciate the new plot more. i became impressed with sam neill and jeff goldblum, as well as the small part for samuel l. jackson. after watching the movie again, i could not stop. i had to watch it over and over, and now i look at it as one of my 2 favorite movies, the rock being the other",Null,0,1,3 June 2001
