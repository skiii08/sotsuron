Deja Vu," Unbelievable
","Really: UN BELIEVABLE.'Deja Vu' has of course the tremendous promise of Denzel Washington in the lead role, and an impressive supporting cast. Alas, the plot and storyline are laughably absurd. When an actor as compelling as Washington can't get me to watch more than 30 min. of a story, then that story has to be really, really bad.So: a few surveillance satellites are able to render 3-D views of anything, anywhere? Cool! What a dynamite was of diagnosing heart disease, or here's a really good one: scan to WTC towers in the months preceding September 11, 2001 and finger the soulless f@cks who set the explosives that blew it to powder in mid frickin air.What a moronic premise, and an entire waste of time and $1 at Red Box.",5,0,1,9 February 2008
Unbreakable," The cheese slid off this cracker
","*Possible spoilers*  This director went to all that trouble to crash land his plot like *this?!* Granted, the guy can create suspense and mood, but this improbable ending had me and the audience scratching our heads, wondering if they just ran out of money and had to 'end it somehow'. .. Though Samuel L. Jackson comes across more wooden than I've ever seen him, overall the acting is excellent. The problem seems to be the implausible script: why spend so much energy developing 'Elijah' as a wounded prophet/healer only to hang capital 'V' 'Villain' on him at the last second? It just doesn't add up.  Hopefully Shanny will thinks his plots through more carefully next time.",6,0,0,25 November 2000
Zodiac," Hmmmm . . .
","'Fight Club' is one of my favorite movies ever: visceral, contradictory, smart, well-paced, ingenious. I can't apply any of these adjectives to 'Zodiac.' The local newspaper reviewer gave it a rave review, so I decided to give it a whirl. While I don't think it's by any means a crappy movie, I don't see what those who rated it a '10' did.There's something about Gyllendal (sp?): he's a good actor, but he never got me to really *care* about his obsession. Same with Ruffalo: good actor; why don't I feel *along with* him?Then again, maybe I saw it on a night that any movie would have left me mostly high and dry.Robert Downey Jr. does terrific work, as usual. Period detail of the 60's and 70's is fantastic. I LOVE the casting choice for Leigh!",8,1,5,4 March 2007
Forrest Gump," An Ode to Joy
","This is my third viewing of 'Forrest Gump'.  The first time I was unimpressed; the second time I had a concussion (rollerblades: too much speed: car) and cried as soon as I saw the feather ; this time I only have a cold. And this movie blows me away even more. As a native southerner, I'm sensitive to 'South/Idiot' allusions in popular media, and instinctively braced myself for either sentimentality or stupidity as that feather began its gorgeous journey. Robert Zemeckis has created a masterpiece. Each aural allusion to Beethoven's 9th Symphony is APPROPRIATE, amazingly enough.And that's all I've got to say about that.",10,1,2,10 October 2000
The Bourne Ultimatum," Oh Baby, Then it fell apart . . .
","Fantastic storytelling here, and dammit, now I've got a man crush on Matt Damon. All three chapters of the Bourne Trilogy hold up exceptionally well to multiple viewings, in fact are enhanced by doing so. As much as I hated to see Franka Potente exit downstream in 'Supremacy', Julia Stiles is excellent as a forgotten paramour. She communicates volumes with her eyes. As in any terrific movie, the supporting cast is exceptional. The soundtrack absolutely rocks: you definitely want to hear these movies with headphones on. Greengrass keeps the action moving, with moments of close-up silence, deftly brushed with Damon's soft dialog, sweetly enhancing the tension. Thanks Bourne team.",10,0,1,11 November 2007
Collateral," Acting Tour de Forces
","Jamie Foxx; holy sh*t, Never knew this dude could act like that. Totally convincing; and the interplay between him and Tom Cruise (who I knew could be knockout) was superb. Tightly written, edge of your seat thriller, with strong supporting work by Mark Ruffolo and Bruce McGill. Jada Pinkett Smith is strong as well; her best work I've seen. Just watched it a second time, and it's still suspenseful. Michael Mann has crafted a suspense thriller that builds like a massive wave. Cruise is super bad @ss and good at it. I believed him, and I'm a tough viewer. Outstanding make-up and photography, and the score is terrific throughout. May buy the soundtrack. Guy who played the trumpet player was superb too. Really, really good, not great movie.",9,2,3,5 April 2005
Tropic Thunder," Shakespearian, Epic
","Wow, that Ben Stiller is one more smart f*kn guy. 'Tropic Thunder' is a riot when viewed either as an action movie, comedy, mocumentary, or metaphorical hard core spiritual initiation tale. As an Action/Comedy, 'Tropic Thunder' is brilliant. Bold strokes paint a fictional world within the fictional world of movies, then has this tag team Fantasy lock braces with Reality (which is only the fictional reality of a movie. . .) The story moves fast: Tugg has the map, mothafkas!; 'I'm the dude playin the dude who's disguised as another dude.' Robert Downey Jr. is at his greatest, playing multiple Oscar winner and Australian, Russell Crowe er Kirk Lazarus. So Downey is actually '. . .the dude who's playing the dude, who's playing the dude who's disguised as another dude.' That, Ladies and Gentlement, takes talent. This is some seriously amazing satire. Moliere would laugh his a$$ off. Gandhi might too, until he cries over the agonies we choose for ourselves on our journey of becoming awakened. Look at the little heroin kingpin's T-shirt when he rips open his over shirt: the image is of a female dancing monster, swinging a dead baby in one arm and somebody's head in the other. Meet Kali, Goddess of Destruction (of illusion.) Having done some serious Shakespeare study, I do not say this lightly: As Shakespeare's brilliance allowed him to write on several different levels at once (from banal to exalted), so does Ben Stiller.",10,0,3,6 January 2011
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Timely
","George Clooney directs a film for our age in 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' David Strathairn delivers Murrow's Kent cigarette shrouded brilliance with his own. Around him are a cast of pro's, well cast. Clooney as Fred Friendly does yeoman's work here, supplying essential,understated, grounding appropriate for this tale. Filmed in blank and white, the film captures perhaps the apex of television journalism when, in the early 1950's, Murrow stood up to the anti-communist, disingenuous, and hypocritical Joseph McCarthy. We have no Murrow's now, and if we did he would broadcast on the internet; no corporate media outlet would touch him. Thinking people will savor this movie. It is worth repeat viewing. But in the age of Infotainment, more will check out within the first half hour, which is a shame: Murrow was a great American and role model for all who strive to be.",10,1,3,2 July 2011
Mission: Impossible II," One rotten movie if you take it seriously at all. . .
","Lessee. . .Cruise-bo manages to kick all the bad guys butts and still maintain his silky locks, while simultaneously cue-ing white pigeons to fly as he rescues the girl and the world at the same time.This stuff is hilariously campy if you watch it on video with a room full of friends and you can take turns mocking its vain self-importance.What on earth could Tom Cruise have been thinking here besides $$$?",5,0,1,9 April 2001
The Insider," Gripping, Disturbing
","Not that it's any big surprise that corporate interests supercede reporting/news on the boob tube, The Insider still chillingly portrays the plight of Jeffrey Wigand, ex tobacco company scientist, on his whistleblowers journey with the 60 Minutes TV Newsmagazine.  This movie had me on edge the whole way.  Outstanding performances, especially from Christopher Plummer.  His turn on Mike Wallace is unforgettable. This Actor is IN THE ZONE!  Al Pacino makes it look eeeeaaasy, and Russell Crowe transcends his dialect struggles (he goes with a mishmash of 'American' dialect, and at times I found it a little distracting), but he scores with his understated Pressure Cooker character development. The screenplay and writing is wonderful, as are many supporting roles.  If you haven't seen this one, you owe it to yourself to check it out.",10,0,0,20 January 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," eyes. . .wide. . .zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

If this is what Kubrick was aiming at; he nailed it.",Null,0,1,21 April 2001
Enemy at the Gates," James Horner: Are you still alive?
",". . .or are you dead and having patchwork pieces of 'Braveheart', 'Apollo 13', 'Glory', 'Titanic' haphazardly stitched together with strands from [John Williams] 'Schindler's List'? Anyone who pays attention to film scores will be appalled at this mishmash.Regarding the plot. . .disappointing, but watchable. Joseph Fiennes over-acts badly, but Jude Law and Rachel Weisz produce fantastic chemistry. 
War scenes are chillingly authentic, and frightening.  And though I enjoyed this movie, it seems 'underbaked' to me, from Ed Harris's stilted speech, to the Brits accents, to that awful, awful score.",Null,1,2,2 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I'm So Confused!
","Alright, I admit that I'm not a huge Star Wars fan. The original premiered on May 25, 1977, which I know only because it was my 15th birthday. I loved the first two. What I enjoy about a good movie is being transported into a fictional world. If I'm watching a movie and thinking about the storyboard, or the clunky dialog, or the utter lack of chemistry between romantic leads, and of the repeated 'wtf??' illogical factors; if I laugh more at places the audience isn't supposed to laugh than at the places we ARE. . .I know I've just seen a pretty lousy movie.I'm sure Hadyn Christiansen is a fine actor, but for the life of me it looked like he was directed in the early scenes to 'scowl just a little', and then told to 'scowl a little more' for each successive scene. His performance was profoundly 2-D, though I think that is probably more the fault of Lucas/writers. Samuel L. Jackson can bring down the house as an actor. ANYBODY could have played Mace Windu. What a waste. Ewan McGregor comes out better than the rest, but he looks pretty bad too much of the time. This is just a badly written and directed mega Pop money maker. I'm sorry to see that G.Lucas has fallen to the Dark Side of NO TALENT.",4,2,5,21 May 2005
Blade Runner," Beautiful, Dark, Provocative
","One of my all-time favorites. Despite a few horribly clunky scenes, this movie works on me every time.  Ford is outstanding. Young is better here than I've ever seen her elsewhere, and their chemistry sizzles. Rutger Hauer is amazing. Vangelis soundtrack is haunting and really makes this film's atmosphere. Gorgeous images.  A feast.",10,6,10,2 December 2000
The Matrix," YeeHaaaa!
","Fantastic movie that really only works when your sound system is excellent. I've watched this one at least ten times, and the difference in the experience is remarkable.  I've never known a movie to hinge so much on its sound quality. Beautifully, hypnotically photographed, in a comic book storyboard style. Keanu is surrounded by top notch actors, and he rocks as Neo.  So what if the philosophy here is half-baked New Ageism; suspend your Critic and Listen to this fun action feast.",9,0,0,15 November 2000
The Matrix," Look. . .Haarrdaaaa. . .
","I just saw 'The Matrix' again at a casino hotel, while Rachel snoozed at my side and I kept the volume down.  I'd come to equate a good viewing of this movie with: have a great sound system or you'll miss 90%.  But I just followed the story this time, and was left wondering:'Who ARE these guys?' the writers, directors; the ones with the vision for this dazzling psychological and spiritual tale?Those who don't get this movie probably won't ever in this lifetime. They rail about 'plot holes' and 'predictability'.  Guess they never read Joseph Campbell on myth and allegory.'The Matrix' could be better, but that's like saying the hot tub sucked because you didn't have a Swedish Massage afterwards. . . or something like that. . .Each character manifests a distinct level of spiritual development, from the 'Initiate: Neo', to the 'King: Morpheus', to the 'Sage: Oracle' , to the 'Shadow: Cipher', to   the 'Warrior:Trinity/Tank/Dozer' to the psychological concept of 'Toxic Introject: Agents', to 'The Man: Neo's corporate boss' , to the 'Ferryman across the River of the Dead: Tank', to the 'Magician: Mouse,Tank. . .' , to the 'Lover: Neo, Trinity' . . .it goes on and on. More informed mythologists than I should have a field day with this movie.To those of you with a mythic bent, watch this one again with this in the corner of your mind: See if you can identify with every single character; all the contradictory pieces of us are spinning right there for us to behold.What a trip.",9,1,2,12 May 2001
Gladiator," Warrior Glory
","Ridley Scott scores a palpable hit with 'Gladiator'. I've seen it twice now, and know that I will revisit this tale of heroism and integrity for the rest of my life.  Musically powerful; photographically virtuosic, 'Gladiator' is a tale told of a man, by a man.  Russell Crowe is astounding as Maximus. Richard Harris carries the weight of a waning empire in his eyes. Joaqin Phoenix seethes a rage of Shakespearean, Lear-like proportions.  Oliver Reed knows Life, so near to death is he. I'm blessed by this film.  Thanks to all of you who performed with Strength and Honor to create it for us.",10,0,0,10 October 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Coen's Best
","As one who grew up in Mississippi, and spent a great deal of time in the Mississippi Delta, I'm invariably disappointed and irritated by stock characterizations of southerners in movies.  This one gets it so right it's 'righter than realistic'.  In fact, I'm probably related to Delmar! Alternately hilarious and obtuse, 'O Brother, Where Art Thou' takes us on the jailbreaking journey of three Depression era convicts.  All the locations are right and Tim Blake Nelson is unbelievably spot on with his period Delta dialect. George Clooney amazes me by making this acting choice, and where he misses the mark dialectically, he makes hay with his 'Ulysses' character.  John Turturro is fantastic, too. But the real star of this one is the writer and director. I'll see this one again, many times.",10,0,0,21 January 2001
