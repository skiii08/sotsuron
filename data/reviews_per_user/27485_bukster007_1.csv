Raiders of the Lost Ark," This Is What All Films Should Be Like.
","As a child of age 13 when this film was released, I saw it three times a week for the entire summer.  This is near perfect filmmaking.  Harrison Ford is perfect as Indiana Jones.  I can't even think of anyone who would have been a better choice.  The action is non-stop and the special effects are top-notch.  It's everything an escapist action film should be.",10,0,1,14 March 2000
