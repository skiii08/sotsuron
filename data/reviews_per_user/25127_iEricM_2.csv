Requiem for a Dream," Amazing.
","This movie is amazing. It grabs you by ensuring you relate to at least one of the characters and pulls you down with them. It shows what can and will happen if you take these drugs, and how it affects not only you, but the people around you. This movie makes you feel for the characters and what they go through, you go through. The film making quality is outstanding and the performance by Ellen Burstyn was fantastic. I never thought I'd see a better actress then Meryl Streep but I have, and it Ellen. I rarely see a movie with quality such as this. It is painful at times, but it is essential. This movie is a must see!10/10",10,3,6,26 May 2007

","Ah, the Devil Wears Prada. What can I say about this one? Well, for starters I thought the performances (specifically Meryl's and Emily's) were fantastic. The story (although predictable) was enough to keep you interested. One of the main things that makes me give this movie a 10 is the dialog. Some of the dialog in this movie is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone old or young (my grandmother has seen it and absolutely adores it). There scarcely is a movie dubbed a 'chick-flick' that I will enjoy enough to give it a ten. This movie, however, is the best 'chick-flick' (I don't really think it is a chick flick) movie I've seen, but its also up there with my favorites of all time. So if that doesn't say enough then I don't know what more I can say.That's All.",10,0,3,29 March 2007
