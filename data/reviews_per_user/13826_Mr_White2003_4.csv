Scarface," Truly Brilliant
","The film is one of the greatest gangster movies of all time with some terrific performances especially Al Pacino, although as great as he is, he extends himself to great lengths in this movie to make us sometimes hate & sometimes love Tony Montana. I think this is just one thing which makes Pacino so great is the fact that he can look like either a bad guy or a good guy and he can act like a bad guy or a good guy as well. In Scarface the performance is just brilliant & i don't think there is anyone who could of played the role better. He has everything right from the accent right down to his manerisms and the way he speaks. As a big fan of Pacino i love almost all of his movies (apart from City Hall) & counting out the Godfather Part 1 & 2 i would say this is his best movie & if you are a fan of his or a fan of Brian De Palma watch this movie! It has one of the greatest endings in movie history, has an awsome soundtrack & set the record for the 'F Word' being used most in a film! Screw the Oscars they don't know anything as Pacino should of atleast had a nomination for Best Actor & screw those crappy Razzie Awards for nominating De Palma as Worst Director he directs this movie excellently!",10,0,1,2 April 2003
Requiem for a Dream," Magnificent Piece Of Work
","Darren Aronofsky who is truly a terrific and very creative writer/director is at his best here with Requiem For A Dream. Everyone i know has said that RFAD is excellent but very weird and dodgy which really it isn't. The film is just showing us (the audience) what the characters of the movie see and feel over their addiction to drugs. The acting in the film is truly amazing especially from Ellen Burstyn who is just brilliant in this movie playing a mother trying to lose weight and then gets addicted to pills and well i won't spoil it for you with what happens to her. Jared Leto is also great in this movie playing the son who is addicted to Heroin, Jennifer Connelly is brilliant as Leto's sexy girlfriend and Marlon Wayans also turns out a good performance as Leto's best friend (also a heroin addict). I believe the film has some of the best editing i have ever seen in a movie and the way some of the quick and snappy shots are put together are fantastic. The music is also brilliant, an eerie instrumental tune which is also used in One Hour Photo. RFAD only recieved one oscar nomination and that was to Ellen Burstyn for Best Actress who maybe should of won it i don't know but i feel other nominations such as Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay & Best Editing should of atleast gone to the movie as well. If you haven't seen this movie forget renting it and buy it now it truly is an excellent very creative movie. 10/10",9,0,0,4 April 2003
Memento," Best Original Movie Since the start of the Millenium
","Memento is truly an awsome movie, one of the best i have ever seen and completely original. This is a movie which you have to sit down and watch and not pause it or turn it off or fall asleep & especially not watch while you are drunk or stoned. The film follows Leonard (Guy Pearce) a regular guy from San Francisco trying to find out who raped & murdered his wife. One problem. He has a short term memory loss. Solution. He uses tattoo's & photo's to remember certain things. Ie. where he is staying, his car, the people he knows. The film itself goes backwards and forwards. Your probably saying what the hell is this guy talking about. Well in the movie there are colour scenes & black & white scenes. The black & white scenes are going forward & they are before Leonard has found the person who raped & murdered his wife. The colour scenes are going backwards so right at the start we see Guy Pearce blow Joe Pantolianos brains out (don't worry this isn't a spoiler as it happens right at the start) then we see a black and white scene then we see the scene before Pearce shot Pantoliano and how it got to the first scene and so fourth throughout the movie. Christopher Nolan has just done something i would like to do and that is to breakout through writing & directing one of the greatest movies in the history of film & have it shown. The performances in this film are brilliant from Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano & Carrie-Anne Moss. The script is bursting with originality and is a must see movie for anyone who enjoys a good movie. Don't waste money in renting it, BUY IT! RIGHT NOW! because i can assure you, you won't be dissapointed. 10/10",9,0,2,4 April 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Not as good as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs but still Amazing!
","Rating *****QT does it again with his different & brilliant style of filmmaking. Kill Bill is not as great as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs in my view but does come close in at 3rd place for me infront of Jackie Brown (which i still liked very much). However what i do have to say is that Kill Bill is Tarantino's best looking/sounding film in terms of visuals & sound. He has once again (like he did in Pulp) changed the order of the film which i believe makes this film even greater but what blew me away was the visual look of the film & especially the sound effects. Ok i watched it at Leicester Square with a massive screen & tons of speakers but i still feel the sound would of been excellent in a smaller cinema. In the scene before Uma Thurman wakes from her comer a mosquito is flying about & it actually sounded like there was one in the cinema & all the sword slashing & stabbing was awsome & the gunshot Uma Thurman takes to the head (i hope no one takes this as a spoiler as you should know she gets shot and wakes up from a coma as that's the whole point of the story) was very good & made tons of people jump in the cinema,me including, as it seemed to come out of no where. I heard it was meant to of been one of the goriest movies ever & although it was fairly gory it still isn't as bad as many people have said it is & was just like the Japanese Versus & was no where near as bad as The Story of Ricky or Braindead! The cast isn't as slick as Tarantino's other films not as good as Jackie Brown (which had a great cast) although Uma Thurman was excellent. Bill Caradine isn't seen visually in the movie (well you don't see his face) Michael Madsen & Daryl Hannah are barely in Vol. 1 & Vivica.A. Fox isn't in it much also whereas Lucy Lui is in it quite a bit & is the character the movie goes into the most although she didn't seem right to me in this part, she had the looks but not the acting ability. Overall Kill Bill is a stunning & amazing achievement in Filmmaking with a terrific ending (which i won't spoil for anyone) to lead to Vol. 2 & with it's fair share of gore, humor & Tarantino trademarks (Shot from car bonnet).5/5 - I can't wait for Volume 2",9,0,1,14 October 2003
