Catch Me If You Can," Entertaining chase movie with all-star cast
","This is one of the greatest 'cops and robbers' chase movies ever, directed by Spielberg, and featuring an all-star cast.I'm not a big fan of movies where the main character is a criminal, but this is the exception. DiCaprio is great as always and his character is so clever and likable, that you just want to see how he cons 'the system' next. The cop chasing him is Tom Hanks. He has a goofy accent, but he is still also likable, even though he gets really obsessed with catching DiCaprio. Christopher Walken is also there for a few scenes as Leo's dad, and he is great as always.What makes this movie even more amazing, is that it's based on a true story.It may seem a bit shallow, since it is basically just one man conning the system in creative ways, but it is very entertaining.10/10",10,0,2,18 November 2010
About Time," Lots of love, not much else going on
","About Time stars Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, a socially awkward young adult who finds out he can travel in time (within his own past) and decides to use his powers to find love. The target of his pursuits is the also somewhat awkward Mary (Rachel McAdams). There are definitely some issues regarding the specific mechanics of the time travel, but it is not a big issue, since this is a romantic comedy with time travel elements and not a sci-fi film about time travel. It seems that the film will be a sort of self-induced Groundhog Day with repeated attempts to make Mary fall in love with Tim. Surprisingly, the time travel mechanic is not used much. In the second half of the film it is only used two or three times.This film is a romantic comedy, meaning it has to check two important boxes: romance and comedy. There is definitely chemistry between the leads. Tim and Mary are very similar: they are both a bit socially awkward, shy, but also very witty. The dialogue between them highlights their similarities and feels very real. Romance: check. The dialogue in the film overall is fantastic, with its British dry wit. Contributing greatly to the comedy are the supporting characters surrounding Tim and Mary like Tim's quirky free-spirited sister or his bitter playwright of a landlord. The scenes between Tim and his father (Bill Nighy) are some of the best in the film. Every character is unique and quirky almost to a fault. Comedy: check Where the movie fails, however, is the plot and plot structure, which is unfortunate considering the interesting concept. A tried and true format for films is to have an overarching conflict that the protagonist tries to solve throughout the film with many obstacles along the way. This keeps the audience invested in every scene. This film does not do that, rather is an episodic series of minor conflicts. There are a scene or two of conflict introduction, then a scene of the conflict being resolved, and then a scene or two of just Tim and Mary just being in love, repeat. The conflicts rarely involve Tim and Mary's relationship at all. For better or for worse it isn't the incredibly formulaic romantic comedy plot structure and on paper this format actually makes sense in keeping with the themes of the film â€“ living life and appreciating life's ups and downs. But this does not translate to screen well. The lack of central tension results in boredom. Also, it means there isn't much of a character arc to Tim. Therefore, when the movie ends, it just sort of happens.Speaking of the ending, the similarity between this film and Richard Curtis' earlier success Love Actually (2003) is very noticeable. Firstly, the ending of About Time is stylistically identical to the opening of Love Actually, complete with a disembodied voice talking about life and love over shots of random residence of London. The plot missteps can also be traced to the 2003 film. Love Actually is an ensemble comedy with each character having their own conflict and resolution. Lacking one central conflict it works in that film because there is no central protagonist. About Time, on the other hand, is a single protagonist film with a multi-protagonist film structure.Overall the film is enjoyable despite its shortcomings. There are plenty of embarrassing and hilarious situations that Tim finds himself in. And for those looking for romance, Tim and Mary's relationship is exactly what you want. But the film could've been so much more, with a better structure to the plot and better use of the under-utilized time travel aspect.",7,0,1,4 October 2013
It Follows," Creepy, but not scary. Atmospheric, no tension. Missed opportunity.
","There are many types of horror movies: gore porn, slasher movies with jump scares galore, and the slow paced creepy and eerie atmospheric films. It seems with the success of 'Paranormal Activity' and 'The Conjuring', the latter style is becoming more and more popular. 'It Follows' follows in the same vain.It is slow, but well-paced, has a great accompanying soundtrack which build on overbearing sense of dread. However, what it is not is scary. The problem lies within its premise. It is unique and interesting – an STD that comes with your own personal spirit-thing that tries to kill you. It slowly and unendingly walks towards you, and if it gets you, it kills you. The emphasis here is on the word slow. It doesn't even walk at a normal speed. You could just briskly walk away from it. At no point was there tension; at no point did I fear for the main character's life. All the atmosphere in the world can't save the film if I don't think the spirit is capable of killing their intended target.",6,5,26,7 July 2015
Midsommar," Red Summer Nights
","So you want to be a writer-director. In film school you develop your passion project idea. You work on it, meticulously rewriting every line, every word until it is perfect. You run through it countless times, trying to get the pacing just right. And if you're lucky, after 10 years of working on it, constantly improving it, your script actually gets picked up and you get to make your film. And it's a smash hit! So now the studio throws a ton of cash and tells you to make another one. And you only have two years to get it done. Previous victims of the sophomore slump include Neil Blomkamp following up 'District 9' with 'Elysium' and Dennis Hopper going from 'Easy Rider' to 'The Last Movie'. I felt fearful for Ari Aster's second feature length film was to be released a year after his first, despite 'Hereditary' being one of the favorite films of 2018. Seeing 'Midsommar', I felt a different kind of fear.Mental disorders, anxiety, grief, cults, and rituals are all notable aspects of both of Aster's films. The similarities between the two are especially prominent in the first act, before the Americans venture to Sweden, but this is not a rehash. Though 'Midsommar' does not have any scenes that are as profoundly impactful and gut-wrenching than the accident sequence in 'Hereditary', this film is overall a more complete film. Most noteworthy, is that unlike Aster's previous film which goes off the rails in a laughable manner in the final act, 'Midsommar' manages to drive up the tension and stakes whilst remaining believable. All the laughs - there are a plethora of dark humor moments - are intentional. Toni Collette, as the female lead of 'Hereditry', had a memorable, manic performance, though, understandably, some found it to be over the top and ridiculous. Florence Pugh's character is much more subdued, but she gives an equally powerful performance. A director is responsible for pulling out the best performances from the actors and Aster has a perfect record thus far.The setting of the film is a folksy village in Hälsingland, Sweden full of flower children in folk clothing, folk dancing and folk singing and folk everything else-ing. One of the American visitors is quite unnerved by the fact that even at 9 pm, the sun in shining brightly in a bright blue sky. One the surface, it may seem like an animist utopia, but seeing one villager playing a flute as another two are locked in an overly long and intimate embrace, you get the sense that it is all too good to be true. As you spend more time with in the commune, you learn about all their bizarre and disturbing traditions.Horror, like sci-fi, works best when used as metaphor or allegory and about more than just killing people and scaring the audience. 'Hereditary' went a step further and for most of the film is a family drama lacking overt horror elements. There are more traditional horror elements - body horror and gore - throughout 'Midsommar', but it still retains a strong emotional core. A seemingly utopian love-empathy cult is the perfect setting for a break-up movie. Dani is an anxious person who needs a lot emotional support, but her boyfriend, Christian - and with a name like that, should you really be going to pagan villages? - is not as invested in the relationship. Their relationship deteriorates as does the situation in Hälsingland.Once again, Aster shows how he is a master of unease and tension. The feeling of dread and danger builds slowly over two and half hours. Though at times there might not be a lot going on in the foreground, the cinematography is so wonderful, that the film never drags. Every shot either has something weird going on in the background, or is beautifully composed, or is it simply cool. Characters take psychedelics and the special effects of them experiencing the visual hallucinations - faces being distorted or the breathing trees - is top notch and hypnotizing without going over the top. His depiction of anxiety via Dani is also spot on. The opening shot is of bright summer Swedish nature with folk singing which suddenly cuts to silent winter scene. Aster often uses this technique of edits with sharp visual & aural contrast which stops the audience for getting a proper emotional footing. And of course, there is a perfect creepy horror score that incorporates the local folk songs. There are no jump scares, but meticulously crafted mood.Ari Aster is a filmmaker to look out for. For a second time he has mastered cult horror and I hope he will branch out and make just as great films in other genres. Hopefully, he teams up once again with cinematographer Pawel Pogorzelski, because that duo is something special. A lot of movies are created to be entertainment, which is especially true for the horror genre. 'Midsommar' is not just entertaining, it is art.",10,3,11,23 July 2019
Elysium," More action than sci-fi
","Neill Blomkamp's previous film, District 9, is one of the best sci-fi movies of the past decade. Unfortunately, his second effort, Elysium, is a sci-fi movie not suited for hardcore sci-fi fans, rather it is targeted more at the typical summer action movie fan.The plot of the film is promising. The wealthy have left the diseased Earth to a space station utopia called Elysium. Max (Matt Damon) is a man with nothing to lose whose goal is to get there by any means necessary. However, the world that is created is filled with unanswered questions. What sort of government is left on Earth, as it seems that the same robots of Elysium keep order on Earth? How does the air stay on Elysium, since there is no sort of solid roof? Even Max's robot suit thing that is heavily featured in the trailers doesn't make much sense. He has the metal parts screwed into is flesh and bones. Any sort of serious blow on the metal parts should make the screws move and break his bones. There are several more questions that can be raised (which I won't at risk of spoilers), and they may seem nitpick-y, however the sci-fi genre is all about creating a believable futuristic world that follows the rules of science.One thing I appreciate about the plot is that it isn't preachy. After seeing the trailer I worried it might talk waaaaaaaay too much about the whole 1% thing. Instead it seems to be more about race. It doesn't talk about it. It's just that most people shown on Earth are Hispanic while essentially everyone on Elysium is white, well except for president Patel. I thought Elysium was for the rich people of Earth. What, Oprah isn't rich enough? OK, so the plot is kind of shaky, but one part of District 9 which isn't lost is the interesting characters. Max is not quite the typical action star. He isn't out to save the world or restore order and justice. He is just out to save himself; he just doesn't want to die. The villains of the film, Delacourt (Jodie Foster) and Kruger (Sharlto Copley, the lead of District 9) are great. Jodie Foster may be a bit more of a cliché super power hungry evil person, but Kruger is fascinating. Unfortunately, I can't get into too much detail at risk of spoilers, but that man is crazy. And Spider (Wagner Moura) should also be mentioned. Blomkamp knows how to make interesting characters.Another reason this feels like a generic action film just in a sci-fi setting, is the emphasis put on Max's love interest Frey (Alice Braga). She seems like an unnecessary character. She is there to provide him with more motivation and a character arc, but that role could've been filled by his friend Julio (Diego Luna) just as easily, without some necessary romance.Looking at the film as an action film it works: great action sequences, cool futuristic weapons and plenty of explosions. Just don't look for a classic sci-fi film like District 9.tl;dr more action than sci-fi, interesting characters, plot notsomuch",6,0,0,18 August 2013
Thor: The Dark World," One of the better entries in the Marvel series
","Thor: The Dark World is the next entry in the high quality series of Marvel movies over the 7 years or so and it is one of the best. Its funny, its got action. And did I mention its funny? Honestly, I think this movie had more sarcastic comments, wise cracks per minute than it did hammer punches to the face.Story is fairly generic. Super evil guy thought long dead wants super evil thing. Thor and crew doesn't want him to get it. It's straighforward enough. However, for a movie titled Thor, it sure does spend a large amount of screen time with other people, Natalie Portman, the other scientists when Natalie Portman is in Viking Land, Loki, the bad guy, Loki again. Actually, I don't really mind the Loki part. I hate him as a character, but he is fascinating. He truly is the god of mischief, you never know what side he is on, though usually its his own side. I don't understand how anybody trusts him ever.Every character always has something funny to say. Every side character is comic relief, and Thor is pretty funny himself too. With so much casual comedy all the time, the incredibly sad and dramatic moments create a jarring tonal shift. Then after a short while its back to jokejokejoke. For most of the movie, the action isn't that mind blowing or fascinating. But the movie makes up for it with the final fight, full of chaos-inducing wobbly gravity and warping all over the place.tl;dr a fun, entertaining super hero movie, with jarring tonal shifts, but one of the most fun final action sequences.",7,7,16,31 October 2013
The Truman Show," A great movie, that is way ahead of its time.
","The plot circles around Truman (Jim Carrey). His entire world (a small town) is just a giant movie set. There are hidden cameras and everybody else is an actor/actress. He, however, has no idea. There are a couple of scenes that show people just glued to the TV watching the show. And apparently it is the most popular show on TV. The amazing thing about this unique plot is, that it was released in 1998, when there weren't all that many reality TV shows. The show becomes more and more relevant with its message of people being hypnotized by reality TV and forgetting to live their own lives.Jim Carrey is amazing. Unlike his other works (Dumb and Dumber and others) he doesn't do over the top comedy. The humor in this movie is of a different sort. It is more subtle. This is Carrey's first serious movie, and it is astounding how he didn't get an Oscar nomination for his performance. He proves himself as an excellent actor, not just a funny man. It is a shame he hasn't taken on more roles in similar dramas.The supporting cast is also great, including Ed Harris, who got nominated for best supporting actor for his role as director of the show.It is a very unique movie with an underlying commentary on society and is full of great subtle comedy. All of that is capped by Jim Carrey's Oscar-worthy performance.",10,0,1,28 December 2010
