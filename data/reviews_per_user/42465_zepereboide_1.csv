The Avengers," More than a super hero movie... A super hero epic!
","I could say that the footage we all have seen from Avengers doesn't do it justice. I mean, you could thought that i'm lying, but... Hell no! I have to say that I was truly skeptical about this film, but I was damn wrong! Joss Whedon has pulled off one of the best superhero flicks i've ever seen. It does not hit The Dark Knight, but it's the best Marvel Studios film so far. Anyway. The Avengers was EPIC. Good writing, good performances, good action scenes. My god, it's really great. Action packed that unite Cap, Iron Man, Thor and HULK!!! Hulk really hit it off. One of the greatest surprises of the film. I guess even haters will enjoy.That is all.",10,12,26,14 April 2012
