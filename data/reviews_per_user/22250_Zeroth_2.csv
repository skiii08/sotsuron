United 93," A Must See
","Though it will always be to early for some this movie is a must see.I went in with low expectations due to a media clip seen on cable news. I felt that I had to watch this movie to honor those who had died by watching their story of terror, bravery and heroism.The expectations I had were so off, the movie was very well made and as far as I have heard from family interviews on cable news, the passengers and flight crew was happy with the overall portrayals.The anticipation level is on high from the movies first opening shoot, we know the ending but we are hoping and on edge waiting for intervention.The movie has no political agenda and takes place in multiple locations (not just limited to the inside of the plane) as the events of September 11th unfold.This film is strong and full of emotion, there were many sobs and sniffles as the lights came up, there were also many people who clapped in honor of the bravery and heroism of the passengers and crew on United flight 93.Many theaters stated they would not show this movie due to sensitivity. This movie in my opinion was in very good taste and is showing in at least 95% of the theaters across Texas. I went to the 7:40pm showing on Friday night in San Antonio, Texas. The theater was just a little over half full, no one walked out in the showing that I saw. I plan to see this movie again and recommend it highly.",10,14,31,28 April 2006
Sin City," Tails of the City
","I love the film Noir of the move; the characters were interesting however the movie as a whole could not keep my interest. There were many good story lines (that I wanted more detail on) but they were not used to their full potential. The choppy story line felt like I was watching it on DVD on fast forward, leaving out the foundation and substance of the story lines. This movie would have been better if they would have focused on fewer characters leaving room for a possible trilogy if wanting to go that route.The acting was bad due to poor direction, at times the actors/actress' seem to look confused as to where they should be focusing their skills toward. I would have to compare much (not all) of the acting in this movie to be that of a low budget no name B movie. Many minute details where over emphasized leaving some of the more important details to be lost in the shadows.I was very disappointed with the movie, I can handle slow but the lack of dialog, direction and substance made this a movie that I would only recommend seeing on cable or at the dollar theater.",4,2,4,11 April 2005
