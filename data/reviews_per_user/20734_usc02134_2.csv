Scarface," Gangster film with humanity
","Scarface at least shows humanity - that this violent world created by those in the Arts and those in society comes to nothing in the end. I think it success has to do with the fact that performances are very personal and the audience will not find it hard to relate to characters. It makes an interesting watch and it will make the viewer wonder as to what will happen next and like the participants we do too like those criminals who thought becoming a gangster was all that - just study the rappers of today and their lyrics.Al Pacino is brilliant as the great Scarface without a plan. Needless to say what I found most fascinating of all is the fact that it is based on a real story.I think it was violent, but it also showed how violence begets violence.We're becoming a society that celebrates violence and that is tragic. Hopefully more filmmakers will key into peace in the future.",Null,1,2,16 January 2007
Good Will Hunting," Definitely worth watching again
","They don't make these kinds of movies anymore. This one had a lot of heart and wasn't pretending to be 'cool'. I get so sick of Hollywood glamour in movies today. There's not enough heart and soul like 'Good Will'. We need more movies that talk about the human spirit instead of spitting on it. Hollywood has become a frat boy house where no one cares about where we're going in the human race. No one cares period. They just want to make money and have their little power struggles. What made this a non-Hollywood movie was the genuine feel of Matt Damon and Robin Williams - nothing glamorous, just real interaction. Definitely cried in the end like everyone else. Amazing movie that deserved the Oscars. Highly Recommend.",Null,0,9,19 September 2005
