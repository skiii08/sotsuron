Black Swan," Campy, Corny, Juvenile. Somewhat entertaining.
","I'm giving this one star in order to try to correctly reduce the disingenuous inflated rating IMDb of 8.6. I now firmly believe that there are focused campaigns out there determined in giving cruddy movies stellar reviews. These reviewers are people directly involved in the making of the movie and people who will directly profit from the movie's success. Shoot, If I were involved in making a movie, I would go on IMDb and write a great review too. I mean, Why not? Get enough people to write a review and voila, you have an instant 'hit' on your hands with an IMDb 8.6 positive user rating. It happened with The Hurt Locker and it has happened with Black Swan. This movie is average, the acting is good but not great. The character development is nil, the story is 2 dimensional, flat, and wholly soap opera-esque. I was entertained, and did not find myself bored. But in no way was I ever 'wowed' with this film. Disgusted? Yes. Grossed out? Yes. Turned on? Yes - several steamy scenes. Impressed. No way. Save your money. Rent on Netflix.",1,21,38,5 February 2011
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino: The master of great story telling!
","I am sorry that I did not see Hateful 8 in the movie theater even though it was my intention to do so. I had been waiting for it for months and knew it was filmed right here in Colorado and I love Tarantino. But when it did get released, It was dead of winter and we had just seen The Revenant which came out at the same time and to be honest, I really didn't want to see another flick that takes place in the freezing cold. So, we waited until Spring and we saw it on Netflix last night. This man never disappoints to thread together an amazing story. You may have your own opinions about Tarantino's penchant for using ridiculously extreme violence to the point of being silly. You hate it, or love it. I get it. But even that aside, his ability to take you on a journey to meet twisted characters and how their story develops, and his incorporation of novelty and the fun of unanswered questions is truly unparalleled by any film maker out there. Tarantino's films have not gotten the credit due since, let's face it, Pulp Fiction, because Pulp Fiction was his first true masterpiece that just lingers in our brains and leaves a very high bar of expectation. I give this film 10 stars out of 10, not because it is a perfect movie, it isn't. But it is so dang entertaining and such a great and fun tale, it simply is just about as good as entertainment gets.",10,5,11,16 April 2016
Notting Hill," 10 stars for the supporting roles! Brilliant performances.
","The opening scene and song from the movie had me groaning 'oh, puh-leeease.' Corny right out of the gate, as were the brutal country songs mixed in after that, but that aside, the movie actually picks up in comedic pace and in story development which yields promise. The plot, dialouge and characters strongly mirror Four Weddings and a Funeral, one of my all time faves, and is worth watching for the whimsical quirky writing and the performances of the supporting cast. There really aren't any real sparks of chemistry between Julia and Hugh but it is still a pleasure to watch their interaction.I probably would have chosen a different actress than Julia Roberts, though her performance is still excellent. I don't know who I would have cast, but someone else. Same criticism of Andie Macdowell from Four Weddings. But the key is to minimize the importance of the leading lady performances in both flicks for the real entertainment factor is to be found from enjoying Hugh Grant's character and ESPECIALLY the sparkling combination of his British friends. Both movies are absolutely made by the interaction of the supporting characters.The ending sequence is particularly promising and is set up to make the film a real winner (one of the best laugh-out-loud scenes is toward the end)and you may find yourself holding your breath for that true heart-soaring moment. You may find it delivers - or maybe you won't. I personally found Notting Hill as well as Four Weddings to have the same 'eh' endings - the kind that are set up to be so wonderful, but when the two would-be lovers don't have that moment (you know, THAT moment of explosive passion and love and connection?- it falls just a little deflated. But that is just my perception! Maybe you'll disagree. You'll have to decide for yourself.",10,7,9,6 July 2010
Bridesmaids," Hilarious movie. It is girls being bad as the boys, and some people just can't handle it.
","While I'm not surprised some people may not like this movie, I am amazed at how many people absolutely loathed this movie to the bottom of their humorless core. Not only do so many say they didn't like it, but that unequivocally Bridesmaids is 'the worst movie of all time.' Wait. Really? Of all time? Little Fockers was WAAAAAAAY worse. Have you all seen that? Seriously, I think we need to get to the bottom of what this hatred is actually all about. I think it just might be a bit of conscious or unconscious sexism. The women in this film don't do anything more outrageous than what any boy has done in recent films that conversely garnered near universal critical acclaim. ie: Wedding Crashers, The Hangover. The difference? It is the deep subconscious aversion much of society has to women being bold and daring and to be just as brazen as the boys. This movie had me laughing at nearly every moment - several until I was crying. If you are stiff and grounded by social norms (ie: only men can exercise flatulence and be funny) then yes, you will likely be naturally repelled by this film. On the other hand, if you are relaxed, have a healthy sick sense of humor, and are one who goes against the grain and have an higher-than-average comedic intellect (enough to know when absurd and utterly ridiculous is the whole POINT and THAT is why it is funny, then you'll likely not only enjoy this film, it might very well be one of your favorites.",10,1,3,18 August 2012
The Hurt Locker," Are You Kidding?
",Oh. My. God. Please rent this so you can see why everyone with sense hates this movie (all except the Clique Elites of the Academy of course) Things I'd like to share off the top of my head: 1. The fact that this beat Inglorious Basterds for best picture simply astounds me. 2. Tarantino was completely shafted. 3. It was more like a 'Made for TV' show than a major motion picture. 4. It won because of stupid left-wing politics...( it was about the Iraq war and it was a war movie directed by a woman. 5. It had constant non-steady cam filming (like a made- for-TV show). 7. A lot of the acting stunk 8. The plot was hollow and insipid. 9. Stupid. 10. Dumb. 11. Bad. 12. Not good. 13. Not realistic. 14. Shallow 15. Annoying. 16. Boring. 17. Weak. 18. Awful. 19. Boring. 20. Stoopid. Terrible. 21. poor. 22. Help me. 23. If I were Tarantino I'd release the Bear Jew on the Academy.,1,35,53,10 April 2010
Paranormal Activity," Well, say what you want, it scared the heck out of me and my husband
","I just have to give this a ten. It absolutely scared the crap out of me and as far as horror movies go, that is the result I want and hardly ever get. Is Paranormal Activity a 'perfect' film? No. It does have flaws, but the intent was to creep the viewers out with the thought possibly, just possibly, hauntings are not only real, but could be demonic and cause great harm. The suspension of disbelief is very effective in this film for those who allow their own fantasy and imagination to take over - able to consider the plausibility that something like this could ACTUALLY happen to them. For those who hated this film, I don't think they got that. All the claims that it was 'boring' indicate to me that these individuals lack the will to give over to the seduction of their own imagination. That said, I do think that a movie can be built up too which can ruin the viewers experience. This is why I try to know as little as possible before watching a movie. My husband and I really had a minimal concept of the basis of the film and definitely had no idea as to any reviews or that there were people who were raving about the film (or otherwise). For a pre-Halloween spook, this film delivered!",Null,2,4,27 October 2011
Mad Max: Fury Road," Could have been great, but they blew it
","The first half hour is excellent. I was on board and blown away. The costumes, set design - and those cars! - were truly amazing. Opening action sequence is incredible - until, they introduced the ultra-dramatic violins and sappy orchestra soundtrack. Absolutely ruined the movie for me. Soundtrack belonged in Pearl Harbor, not Mad Max. Should have been heavy metal or dub step electronic music, or even better, barely any music at all. It just made the movie so cheesy. Then add lack of plot, no character development and sub-par acting and you get a somewhat forgettable movie. Charlize Theron who is indeed an amazing actress, supposedly gives a stellar performance in this flick. I really don't know how that is determined. She basically says nothing and just scowls the entire time. I totally checked out mentally from this movie about 60% into it. I really wanted to leave, or start checking email on my phone.",5,16,33,24 June 2015
