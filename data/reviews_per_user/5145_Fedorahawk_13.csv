3:10 to Yuma," Reboot: A Decent Film
","'3:10 to Yuma' is a fun action western that keeps you guessing what will happen next. The acting is excellent all around and the story is simple but at the same time it collects one's attention. The settings are beautiful and when you break it down, this film really does not have too many flaws. My only complaint for this film is the pacing and the character development for both the Main and side characters. The pacing seemed to jump from face paced to slow and dull. The character development was slow on most of the characters which really isn't an issue, for the movie is solely based on the story and action. There really is no reason to complain about this movie, but sometimes the movie just does not connect with the viewer. Part of me really loves this movie, while another part of me dislikes certain aspects of the film for no real legit reason. Since I have not seem the original 3:10, I can make no comparison. I can assume that the original is just as enjoyable if not better then the reboot.",7,0,0,30 May 2014
Public Enemies," A Wonderful, Suspenseful Crime Drama
","Johnny Depp brings another expectational performance by playing the role of a famous criminal, John Dillinger. Not only does this film bring awesome performances, but it brings an exquisite look into the land of biographies. Following the life of John Dillinger through the film is a thrilling adventure into the conflicts and daily distractions of many criminals of that time period. Being able to follow both sides of the conflict, that being the FBI agent Melvin Purvis, played by Christian Bale and the criminals of the story (John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, and Baby Face Nelson). It has enticing romance, killer action, and a deep story. It is worth the time and money to take a look at this excellent film.",9,0,2,15 June 2014
The Mummy," Fear The Mummy
","The Mummy is an action film that has the right mixture of humor, romance, horror and action. The acting is played in a comedic style, which is OK because the story plays this aspect well. There is nothing wrong with this film per se, but issues that arise may come from a lack of development in the characters, both main and side. It also may be because of the extreme amount of death that never ends throughout the entire film, killing off everyone who was not a main character. But besides these small instances of pain, the film is decent on all other accounts. It is worth a viewing, especially if you intend to view the sequels. Just don't expect the third film to be decent.",8,1,1,30 May 2014
Forrest Gump," What Is There To Say About This Film?
","Forrest Gump is probably one of the most well known films of all time. By now it is a classic of cinematic history. To talk about this movie in anyway would be futile, because everyone has their opinion on it by now. It is an excellent film, but I feel it is a bit over-hyped. Since everyone has seen it, its popularity is astounding. The acting is great, the cinematography is outstanding, the story original and interesting. It is quite a long film, but that is cast out by the enjoyment of the film. Tom Hanks brings a magnificent performance, as to be expected. There is not much to talk about this film, so I will leave it at that.",10,1,2,17 June 2014
Predator," An Action Classic of the 80's
","Predator is a classic film, that is a fact. The franchise is strong, even if the films and games are not the best materials produced. The original Predator is a beautiful example of how action films ran in the '1980's'. There is no doubt that this film has left an impact on the history of cinema. The action is non-stop, the suspense is thrilling and the characters are rememberable and spew some of the best one-liners ever. Arnold is himself in this movie, which is given. That those not make the film bad, however. The only issues that I can deduce is the lack of character development. I understand that this certain genre of film does not need a well developed story and character, but it would do the film some good if it had. All in all, it is worth a watch and a re-watch, for its monster and its killer action.",8,0,1,30 May 2014
Die Hard 2," And The Sequels Begin
","After the success of the fist Die Hard film, it was no surprise that a sequel would soon follow. A positive remark that can be made about this film is that it is not the worst sequel ever made. Of course the action, dialogue, and story line are recycled. That isn't the issue. In my opinion, the only place it lacks is in the villains. The original film had one of the most memorable villains of all time, Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman). This film does not define itself with a unique villain. They are bland in many aspects, with no offense to the actors playing them. Any issues that can be found comes from the writing, which is saying something, because the writer, Steven E. de Souza is a wonderful action film screenwriter, but I digress. Anyway the film isn't bad, it just doesn't live up to its predecessor.",8,1,1,28 May 2014
Independence Day," It's Bad, And Its Good.
","Independence Day is one of those cult classics, in my opinion. There are some many things wrong with this movie, but because of that it is memorable and, in an odd sense, enjoyable. The plot is basic, the dialogue is painful and the characters are all over the place, a common attribute of Roland Emmerich. Even the action is somewhat dull (except for the destruction of the big cities by the alien ships, that stuff was pure awesomeness). Besides all the hate, it is very lovable after you peel away the awful outer layer. It's really painful, but it is perfect in the eyes of those who can see it's horrific nature and relish in that fact.",6,0,0,30 May 2014
I Am Legend," A Decent Look Into Survival, But Lacks Motive.
","First to state that this movie, in no way is the worst thing ever. It has its definite faults, but one should try to look past some to see any positive attributes. The acting is good in most aspects (mostly due to Will Smith). The real issues come from the CGI, plot, and terrible conclusion of the film. The infected within the film look more fake then realistic, which takes away from the film in every aspect. This murder of CGI leads into the plot, which is slow to begin with then rushed at the end. Most of it feels like filler, trying to pass the time until something emerges that sparks development in Will Smith. But the worst part about this film is the disappointing and angering conclusion. I will not state what happens at the end, but it is not a good pay off. I will give the film some credit in almost bring the waterworks in halfway through the film, but that will also not be spoiled. All in all, this film has the potential, but in the end does not take advantage of the positives and leaves behind copious amounts of negatives. It is worth a look at, but be warned.",7,0,0,15 June 2014
The Mummy Returns," A Decent Sequel, One That Sparks Another Franchise
","So the real issue that I can find with this sequel comes from the story and the introduction of The Scorpion King. The story is a bit blander then the first film, but only within the first half. They even recycle the main villain of the first film into the second one. The acting is set back from the first one a bit, adding new side characters that don't add as much towards the story. My other issue that arose from this film is the introduction of the Scorpion King. Some how they made an entire different spin off from this character that was in the movie for only five minutes. This isn't the worst thing that this film could have done, it just pisses me off. It is not bad, by any means. I guess I am just getting nit picky and stuff.",7,0,0,30 May 2014
Die Hard," The Start of Something Great
","Die Hard can be defined as the most influential action film of the late 1980's. The film may not be the most unique when it comes to story or dialogue, but it makes up for that by making itself extremely rememberable. What I find to be the most important aspect of the film, however, is the main character John McClane. As an action hero, he is surpassingly relatable. Unlike other actions heroes of the 80's, John is not invincible. He gets hurt like a normal human being, showing his human side, and having the viewer feel for the character. And of course the action is impressive and the basic storyline is still enjoyable. There are real no negatives that can really be pointed out, it isn't perfect, but it is a classic, unforgettable film. All in all, the acting is good, the dialogue is hokey but lovable, the action euphoric and the story typical but still captivating. I would rather not bring up the sequels, for that is for another time. I would like to look at the original Die Hard as something separated from the future pains that follow.",9,2,3,28 May 2014
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Innovating Into Something Different
","Die Hard: With a Vengeance is the third film in the Die Hard series, and like the others it is not half bad. It redeems itself after the second film, with a couple of major difference. The first major change is having a well planned villain, like the original film. Jeremy Irons as a German terrorist who seeks vengeance is enjoyable to watch. The second major difference that made the film better was the introduction of a more personal sidekick, in this case it is Samuel L. Jackson. Both of these changes increase the watchability of this film, and brings something new to a continuous film series. The fact still remains that it can still get worse, and it will with the newest installment. That is for another review. All in all this film is a decent action flick that is worth a look especially if you have seen the first two films.",8,0,0,30 May 2014
The Blind Side," Whose Story is it Anyway?
","Time to complain about a film that would rather take away then include an important aspect of a true story. When watching the film, one should say this story is about Michael Oher, a man who, with the help of a supportive, slightly wealthy family, was able to overcome his hardships of homelessness and loneliness through perseverance and friendship. But the reality of this film is far from that description. It is more about the stupid sport of football and the rich family taking in Michael. I felt that the film did not put enough into the character of Michael Oher, they instead took away from him. I can see the potential of the character, but the story of the film limits him of almost everything except for being a mindless brute on a field. I know for a fact that the real life Michael Oher is nothing like this, nor ever really was. This film was to shine on the rich family, and the goodness they implanted on the world. In a way, it was selfish to put them above Michael in his own story. Sure Sandra has good acting qualities, but that should not be the basis of the film. Anyway, it was still a movie of an intermediate standard. It lacks in many departments, but the worst is the conversion from the novel to the film. If they had focused more on Michael and not the family, then maybe it would have been a better flick, but alas.",6,9,10,13 June 2014
Live Free or Die Hard," The Fourth: A Decent Sequel
","At times one must look past the first installment to see the positives of a franchise, especially if there is a nineteen year gap. One must look past the old positives and negatives and form a new opinion based on the material presented. With that said, the fourth installment of the Die Hard franchise is a very decent film taking the viewer on a crazy action ride. Bruce Willis is still going at it, and for some reason he can never avoid terrorists, ever. This time the villain is a computer genius who wants revenge against the United States after being ignored. No, it is not the best plot of all time, but it makes up for that by having nonstop action and likable characters, which includes Justin Long, who fits his part well as the not very sharp computer kid. All in all it is an enjoyable flick with positives and negatives. It is worth a watch if you still enjoy extreme action and the computer subject matter that is involved.",9,5,8,30 May 2014
