Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Boring - SPOILERS when it says (SPOILERS)
","Its been a while since i watched a movie in the theatres that i actually looked at my watch as much as i watched the movie. kill bill vol 1 was an actual decent movie for tarantino, it had laughs, great fight scenes and some decent dialogue. and i don't even like him that much. so obviously i came into kill bill vol 2 expecting to be blown away by great effects, great fight scenes, and good dialogue. well the only thing i got was DIALOGUE. it was like i was watching a woody allen movie without the humor. honestly there were some parts that i enjoyed but there was too much story telling. and another thing is that in the first one she had such a hard time getting to the people she wanted to kill and then the scenes were creative and well made.
in this one (SPOILERS) she doesn't even kill one of the people on her list and the fight scene with elle driver had little fighting and although the ending was creative it wasn't pleasing. and finally the death of bill was awful, we never even got to see this man fight he just dies by some BS technique. what a bore-fest 3/10",3,16,30,17 April 2004
The Elephant Man," The Best of all David Lynch movies.....
","David Lynch over all is not a bad director, this movie proves it. I just wish he would make more movies like this than movies like Mulholland Dr. If you wish to see a David Lynch movie that is going to make you feel bad, angry, and all sorts of emotions then watch this one. If you wish to waste your time watch his other movies.... **** out of *****",9,1,1,27 January 2003
