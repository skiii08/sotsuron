Hereditary," Oscar for Toni
","Hated the ending. Loved, loved, loved the film. Toni's acting is one of the best by any actress in recent times. She must must get an Oscar. Otherwise, Oscars are rigged or simply stupid. The film did not scare me as much as it moved me. The emotional depth of each character is extraordinary.",10,3,6,22 August 2018
