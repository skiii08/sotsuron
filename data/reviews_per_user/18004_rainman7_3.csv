Scarface," Not that good
","I recently watched this film a couple weeks ago, and I was forever waiting for this slow-moving, boring movie to end.  Definitely not for mile-a-minute action fans, because it makes you wanna fall asleep throughout the whole middle of the film.  You could sleep through the climax if you wanted to! Incredibly dull, and trite.  The only thing that holds it up is Pacino's masterful, bravura performance.  Otherwise, a stinker.",4,13,26,1 March 2000
Citizen Kane," The best motion picture ever made
","I must have seen this film 20 times, and never get bored of it once.  The cinematography, the actors from Mercury Theater, and the incredible screenplay will blow you away.  It has amazed me that this film was booed at the Academy Awards preview, and only won one Academy Award for Best Screenplay!  I highly agree with AFI for choosing this movie as #1.  **** out of ****",10,0,1,19 January 2000
Fargo," Definitely the best movie of 1996.
","This film is definitely in my top 5 films of the 90's.  It's the first Coen brothers movie I've seen so far, and it sure won't be the last.  Comedy, weirdness, suspense, and so much more is mixed in to a hilarious, uneasy, and sometimes an edge-of-your-seat movie.  Whatever you do, don't watch it on TV, where so much is edited out.  9 out of 10.",10,0,0,4 April 2000
