Scarface," Scarface
","I believe scarface is one of the greatest films out there because of the amount of joy you get out of the performances from the actors and actresses involved who all have great characters to play ,Al Pacino who plays Tony Montana the lead character migrates to Miami in United States of America from Cuba, because of the country's hard times, delivers all too perfectly with the rest of the cast. This film is covered with great performances and Al Pacino/Tony Montana delivers some classics stuff which gives this film a timeless dynamic which means you could watch this film more then once and still come back for more.",9,0,1,14 April 2005
