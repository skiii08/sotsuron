Mission: Impossible III," Instant Classic!
","Let me clearly state that I had no ultra high expectations of this flick. The teaser was extremely cool but then again, that's what teaser is supposed to be. What really got me excited where the samples from Michael Giacchino's score on soundtrack.net. They where so marvelously complex in orchestration and so perfect in execution that it thrilled me to the bones. It also clearly stated that we where going to see a real spy film.And what a film it is! This is without doubt one of the best spy films I have ever seen. It kicks True Lies from his throne. This film is the Incredibles of the live action spy-films. The script is awesome, focusing more on Hunts personal live which gives him a depth the character didn't had in the previous films. The overall acting in the film was from a extremely high level. Hofman shines as bad ass Owen Davian. Shaun of the Dead star Simon Peg steals the show in the scenes he's in and Cruise gives away his best performance to date.The emotion in this film is tremendous. From heartbreaking till terrifying till adrenaline pumping. The action scenes in this film are so breathtakingly awesome that they really squeeze your throat only to let go when the show is over, leaving you gasping for air. The cinematography was top-notch. The gritty movements made the most spectacular sequences feel so realistic that they never became over the top.So no negative points on this flick? Yep, one, the Kanye West song in the credits. What a horrible way to end this film. Specially when you have a score so brilliant as this one.I can't recommend this high enough! It's one of the greatest spy/action films ever made! It has scenes unlike any you saw before. Thank you Mr. Abrams, Cruise, Giacchino and the rest of the production team for delivering an instant classic that'll be remembered amongst the great Bond films like Goldfinger and Goldeneye.

Hostel," Horrible film. Not disturbing. Not extremely gory.
","The trailer promised us a new standard in modern horror. A new wave where extreme violence would be shown uncompromised, with characters and situations that disturb you so much it gets you vomiting your way out of the theater. A horror unlike anything you ever saw before. And what a horrible film it was.Never ever did I saw a film so uninteresting and so boring before. A film that has no idea what genre it wants to be. The amount of gore in this flick is extremely low and the gore that is supposed to be gory is so ugly and comic style it isn't disturbing at all. It makes you laugh.After 40 Min's of tidies you don't give a f*** about the characters. For the good and worse. Normally you feel for a character so you don't want them to be tortured or you hate them so much you can't wait to see it, well, this had none of both. And the concept is so awesome! What is that place? The only good thing of the movie, the place itself, but what do we know or find out about it? Nothing, we get a cheesy escape flick. I want to find out why they are tortured and what the intention is of the people involved. This film has some good moments but those are just not enough to make this a total failure.Waste of our time. Hostel 2 better be much better or I never watch a Eli Roth film again.",4,2,3,8 May 2006
