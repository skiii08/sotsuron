The Avengers," Very Typical
","I wouldn't recommend it to a friend but I wouldn't try to persuade them not to see it either. I usually find IMDb ratings fairly accurate. The Current rating of 8.9 suggests this movie will be something special. Unfortunately all I saw was something very typical, very Hollywood and very predictable. As more people vote and the hype dies down this movies rating will fall below 8.Don't get me wrong, you will be entertained if you watch it.. The special effects are ... well.. Special. There are even several instances where you will laugh out loud. There are some genuinely funny parts that I wasn't expecting.The problem is the story line is very unoriginal and you're never gripped by what is unfolding. Think transformers. There are just too many clichés, and many instances where things are simply not plausible, even for superheroes. I know it's not meant to be realistic but you will be muttering under your breath 'yeah bull ___ ' at some of the outrageously unlikely feats. Ironman's mid-air ship repair is one particularly bad scene you should watch out for.The acting was acceptable given the script they were working with. It's hard to deliver a line well when it's a god awful cliché. It's the kind of thing where the actor just about looks at the camera and says 'Let's get these guys!' or 'you're going to pay for that!' It sounds like an overly negative review but that has a lot to do with my expectations given the IMDb rating. See it if you want some thoughtless entertainment. 6/10",6,7,24,29 April 2012
