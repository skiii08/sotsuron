Requiem for a Dream," Be excited, be, be excited!
","I really can't wait to see what Darren Aronofsky does next. Pi was great, but this movie takes the theories and techniques that he used in that movie and sends them into outer space. The performances are breath taking. Everybody sinks their teeth into the role they play, to the point where it feels more like a home movie than a scripted effort. Ellen Burstyn is incredible. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are also superb as the teen junkies, but the biggest surprise for me was Marlon Wayans (he can actually act!).The movie is dived into three acts: Summer, Fall and Winter. Summer is morbidly depressing, so you can probably guess that Fall and Winter are positively gut-wrenching. Suffice to say that this is not a feel good movie by any means. I wouldn't suggest it unless you are in the mood for something very (and I mean VERY) dark.Great follow up for Darren.10 out of 10",10,0,1,11 June 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Holy 'script written by a third grader', Batman!
","I saw the original Star Wars when I was 6 years old, and I loved it. I had never seen anything like that before, and neither had anybody else. Having said that, the only forward progress the series made, was from Star Wars to The Empire Strikes Back. After that the movies have gotten worse by leaps and bounds. Which brings me to The Phantom Menace. This movie is embarrassing it's so bad. Every time I see Jar Jar Binks I want to shoot the TV like Elvis. The story is absolutely ridiculous, and if you can still be impressed by the special effects after the first time you see it, then I'm guessing that you're below the age of 10. After the special effects wear off, you're left with nothing but bad acting and crappy dialogue.I'm still curious why George chose to make Anekin a bumbling fool operating more on fantastic luck than on the skill of the midget-chlorines or whatever they're called. It's deplorable! The scene where he flies into the enemy mother ship by accident makes my face turn red with shame it's so bad.I guess the moral here is, Star Wars has always sucked, but we were just too young to realize it.5 out of 10 (and I'm being generous here, people!)",5,0,1,12 June 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," What's the big deal?
","I grew up on Black Belt Theatre and my opinion is that this movie is no better or worse than any any other cheap kung-fu flick! The fight scenes are very well choreographed, but I felt they were so long that it ruined the excitement of it all and left me feeling bored by the end of the scenes that, by the way, never seem to end with anyone being defeated. In short... So what!",3,1,2,25 March 2002
Pi," Simply incredible!
","I hadn't ever heard of this movie when I rented it, but I'm darn glad I did! Darren Aronofsky is as talented as any filmmaker out there today. Do yourself a favor and see this one as soon as possible. The use of the camera is of special import in this movie, and is reminiscent of a cross between Sam Raimis' earlier work and the works of Roman Polanski. Aronofsky has a distinct visual style and a love for weird montage pieces. However, as great as this movie is, if you do not like experimental films that tend to challenge the viewer to make sense of it, rather than a neatly laid out and well explained plot, you more than likely will not enjoy it. On a $60,000 budget, Darren has made a lasting impression on the film world that will not soon be forgotten.P.S. This movie has some of the greatest voice-over monologues ever! Enjoy!",10,1,4,1 May 2003
The Evil Dead," You will die!!! Like the others before you.
","There's not much I can say about this one. This is one of the greatest horror films of all time. It will live on in infamy long after I and all of the other original fans have gone.How Sam Raimi managed to come up with this movie on a shoestring budget is beyond me. I don't really want to recommend this film because I assume most of you have seen it, but if you haven't seen it, go see it right now!There aren't too many other horror films that can match this one in its intensity and vision. An absolute classic in every sense of the word! To see it is to rejoice.10 out of 10",10,1,3,19 May 2003
A Bug's Life," Larvae of all stages...
","I love this movie. It has just about everything you could ask for in a comedy. The characters are all great, and the animation is striking. Loosely based on 'The Seven Samurai', there's enough here to keep all ages entertained.Of all the Pixar efforts (I haven't seen 'Finding Nemo' yet), this one is the cream of the crop. The story, thankfully, is less manic than the 'Toy Story' series, and manages to keep you laughing through the whole movie.I highly recommend this one to anyone who might have thought that it was only for kids. Sometimes you just want something that will make you laugh. See it and enjoy!10 out of 10",10,0,1,12 June 2003
Rosemary's Baby," See it whether you want to or not!
","I own this movie and I hve seen it hundreds of times. By now I've seen it so many times that I can say, with the confidence of a major film critic, that this is the most meticulously planned movie ever filmed. Literally every frame is highly stylized artwork. Even scenes that appear to have nothing to do with the movie i.e. the 'These are shelves' scene, really have everything to do with the story, you just haven't realized it. The running theme in this movie is obviously...the shelves! They hold the key to everything else in the movie. Even if you've seen this on before, see it again and pay attenetion to the shelves!",10,1,3,26 March 2002
Army of Darkness," Bootleg edition...
","This movie has never been one of my favorites, partly because of my love of the first two movies in this series. I will give it to the bootleg edition though, they've made this movie better than it has been. It's worth the price of the DVD (I bought it at wal-mart for 12 bucks!)to see the alternate (original) ending.",7,1,1,2 December 2002
Evil Dead II," I feel like someone just walked over my grave.
","Somewhere between a remake and a sequel, we have Evil Dead II. It is interesting how this movie has divided many horror fans. Some don't like the comedy aspects of the film, and some of us seem to feel that it fits in pretty well with the over the top nature of the story. I am one of the latter horror fans. Let's face it, the first movie was a great horror movie, but how much more could you do with it? Would you rather see a sequel in which Bruce Campbell is attacked by demons for an hour and a half? Sam Raimi did a great job coming up with ways to keep it all fresh, and the comedy was one of those innovations. All that said... I still like the first movie better. One thing that part II does better than part I is the character development. The characters are a lot more personality driven in this installment. Hats off especially to Dan Hicks for the greatest redneck role ever captured on film. I'd love to see him in something else.While there are shortcomings here, this one still makes it into my top 10 list (along with part one). A final note: If you've seen part I and then see part II but don't like the comedy angle... don't see Army of Darkness because you'll hate it.9 out of 10",9,1,1,12 June 2003
