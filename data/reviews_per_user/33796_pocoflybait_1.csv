Resident Evil: Afterlife," Yawn
","I really don't have much to say. I found it to be slow. I don't think there was even one seen where they even attempted to startle the audience. Out of the 4 RE movies, I found this one to be the least favorite. They should have stopped at 3. I wish I could say more but it really was...boring. Wait for the DVD if you're going to watch it...IMO.I guess I give it a 5 for the remix song at the end performed by A Perfect Circle. 5 meaning the rating goes up just because of the song, without, the rating would be lower. Good remix of a good song.Is it too much to ask for a better plot? The action was OK in parts but nothing different than what you would expect.I just hope they don't make another.",5,2,5,29 September 2010
