Scarface," Gritty, Relentless Drama
","Scarface, the 1983 film directed by Brian De Palma, is a great drama. It tells the story of Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant who comes to the U.S. in search of the American dream. Gradually, he achieves this through Miami's cocaine trade, but rapidly descends once he gets there. This movie is unforgiving in portraying the drug trade in Miami. It is graphic in language and violence (who can forget the gruesome chainsaw murder or the point blank shooting in the car?) Still,it is powerful and visceral in its presentation, and has become a staple in our society. A film that should be at least seen once by everybody at an appropriate age. Definitely one of the best I have ever seen.",10,0,1,26 September 2007
