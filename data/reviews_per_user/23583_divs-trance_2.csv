Blade Runner 2049," Did not disappoint, even though I went with insanely high expectations!
","I'm a HUGE fan of the original, and when I found out there was going to be a sequel, I cringed. Then I found out who was directing it, and got my hopes up.
When I came out of the hall, I was elated! This was probably the greatest sci-fi film I have had the pleasure of watching in a cinema hall! (I'm not that old)Thank you so much for this film!",9,2,13,12 December 2018
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises will render you incapable of speech for at least half an hour after its perfectly satisfying end.
","Sometimes, when you are lying out under the open sky on a calm night, and you look up at the sky - into the unfathomable ocean of stars and planetary bodies and things yet unknown and unheard of, you suddenly realize how small and insignificant you are. You realize how petty and ridiculous are the things you dream or worry about, and THAT is probably the most humbling sensation that you are capable of feeling. When I saw 'The Prestige' a few years back, I was blown completely off mind. I saw the movie again and again, trying to hold on to the sensation, you know, like you do with something really tasty - you eat it slowly, savoring all the flavors. Surely, I thought, no piece of art could EVER reach this level, let alone cross it... but then I saw 'The Dark Knight Rises'.Whereas The Joker had been a madman on a killing spree, Bane is a much more sophisticated villain with incredible strength - mental and physical. The fall of Batman and the large scale destruction of Gotham city leave you with a feeling of irrevocable hopelessness. To sum it up, the movie has a brilliant story with brilliant acting and direction that should be sung about.@Chris Nolan: I have long held a theory that a man who is truly good at what he does - a man who sets standards nearly impossible to beat - a man who leads by example - is truly worth worshiping. For me(and many others I am sure), you, Sir, lie in the league of other Gods such as Da Vinci, Homer, and Mozart. Nothing but respect for the man who made me feel the most humbling of all sensations - TWICE.",6,2,6,22 July 2012
