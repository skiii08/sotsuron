The Blair Witch Project," I had dreams before I saw it!
","The anticipation was too much - I visited the web page and was fascinated by the effort put into the the whole myth. Interviews, footage, evidence samples. If I didn't know better, I would have been freaked out by this site alone. I was careful to avoid any spoilers or plot summaries, but explored the site thoroughly and found myself actually having dreams about this totally horrific film which was being called the scariest thing around. Then I saw it. Well, I didn't really find it scary - more 'chilling'. Especially the very last scene where you see Michael in the corner and you know what Heather's fate is to be and when Heather finds the fingers in the cloth. Otherwise, I found it dragged a bit. But having said that, it was its subtlety that made it enjoyable. If a hairy witch had suddenly leapt on them and tore them to shreds before the camera, I think it would have lost something vital (else they would)",Null,0,1,24 February 2001
