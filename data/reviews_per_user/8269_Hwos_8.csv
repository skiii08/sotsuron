Casablanca," Great Film
","Casablanca is generally regarded as one of the top films of all time, and with good reason. This film works perfectly on every level. The film takes place in Casablance a free French run city in the early stages of WWII. Casablanca is a stop on the best escape route from Europe to the United States,and is therefore home to a diverse group of people from all of Europe. While the events, and people in the film are historically significant, at its core the film is a love story. It is a story about Rick Blaine, played by Humphrey Bogart, an American bar owner in Casablanca. He is a no nonsense man's man who sticks his neck out for no one. Rick finds himself in the middle of a political mess when he is secretly entrusted with valuable documents that are sought by the authorities, and desired by many. The story turns when Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) shows up at Rick's bar. Ilsa had loved Rick and broke his heart turning him into the hard man we see. Rick, Ilsa, and the other characters are entertaining as the plot twists and turns to its unpredictable finish. Bogart's performance is the best I've ever seen on film. As a viewer you feel his emotions deeply, and relate to him wholeheartedly. His character is a complicated one, which makes his performance that much better. The story, characters,acting, lighting, and camera work all combine to make this one of the best films you will ever see.",Null,0,1,15 October 2011
Citizen Kane," Superb
","Citizen Kane is at or near the top of any all time great movie list ever assembled, and for good reason. It is a true masterpiece by Orson Welles who directed and starred in the film. Welles character, Charles Foster Kane, exudes charisma and confidence. Welles as an actor created one of the deepest, most complex, and memorable characters in movie history. He is impossible to take your eyes off of throughout the film. Welles was surrounded by a strong supporting cast, and benefited from an engrossing story. The only thing that surpassed Welles as an actor was his superb directing of this film. Welles use of lighting was wonderful. From back lighting to spot lights to beautiful natural outdoor lighting, Welles used every tool at his disposal. The camera work was even better. Every scene was crisp, clean and expertly shot. Welles work behind the camera and in front was so noticeably professional, above grade, and frankly perfect that even a novice to film can't help but notice and appreciate it. Simply put this is one of the best films I have ever seen, surpassed only by 'The Godfather' in my humble opinion.",Null,0,1,25 October 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," Very Slow Film
","'The Grapes of Wrath' as a film was very similar to the novel in one unfortunate way, it was very slow to develop. It is the story of the Joad family in the dust bowl of the western United States, during the Great Depression of the 1930's. The Joad's are destitute and heading west in hopes of finding a better life. Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad was the lone bright spot in this film. The plot was very slow and deliberate, by design. The film is meant to portray a struggle, and the fight against hopelessness, which it does well, unfortunately it does it at the expense of keeping the interest of the viewer. The sad, drawn out tale is, plainly put, not very interesting or fun to watch. As a documentary it would have worked by telling such a fine story, but as a film that is meant to entertain an audience it fell flat on its face. Watching this film felt like work more than entertainment, and although it may be understandable because of the subject matter, the end result is a film that is not enjoyable.",Null,0,1,15 October 2011
The Graduate," I Didn't like Hoffman's Performance
","The Graduate is the story of Benjamin Braddock played by Dustin Hoffman. Braddock recently graduated college and is feeling lost in life when he is seduced and has an affair with Mrs. Robinson a sexy older woman played by Anne Bancroft. Ben has known Mrs. Robinson his entire life and the affair sours when he falls in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter. The film follows his pursuit of the daughter and the backlash from his affair. Bancroft was great as the sexy Mrs. Robinson, and the use os Simon and Garfunkle's music complemented the film perfectly. To me the film was not as good as advertised because I didn't find Dustin Hoffman's character believable. Hoffman's portrayal of Ben as lost and naive was overdone and unbelievably, specifically when it came to his interaction with Mrs. Robinson. The gee shucks Mrs. Robinson schtick didn't jive with someone mature enough to be having an affair that was so dangerous. Hoffman only seemed real when he was fervently trying to win over the daughter, Elaine. The story was entertaining, and most of the actors did a good job, but Hoffman's failure and lack of realism made this film very average to me.",6,0,2,10 December 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Superb Entertsinment
","The best compliment for any form of entertainment is to say that it put you in a great mood, and no film I have ever seen did this more than Singin' in the Rain. This film had it all. It was a great comedy, a great musical, and a great love story perfectly intertwined. The cast was flawless. Gene Kelly's leading man was perfect. I could write forever about how charming, funny, and likable he was, but simply put he was just perfect. Debbie Reynolds also turned in a stellar performance, and Don O'Conner's character, Cosmo Brown, stole the show. When he was on screed I literally could not take my eyes off of him. His great dancing, quick jokes, and boyish exuberance were mesmerizing. This film was so entertaining and fun to watch that my only regret is that I didn't see it sooner. An absolute must see film that will leave you smiling.....and singing!",Null,0,1,8 November 2011
A Clockwork Orange," A strange film
","Stanley Kubrick directed 'A Clockwork Orange' a very strange film. The film tells the story of the narrator, Alex DeLarge, a charming and scary criminal thug who rape and violence come naturally to. Alex is caught, convicted, and undergoes an experimental 'cure' at the hands of the government that changes who he is. The film doesn't glorify or renounce violence, it shows it very matter of factly. Kubrick instead forces you to look at the criminal's role in society, and the ideas of free will, and individual rights versus overall benefit to society. The film starts out very fast and slows down as the story develops. This film takes many strange twists and turns, and although it wasn't something I enjoyed, Kubrick did a wonderful job of telling this strange story, and the movie will stick in your head long after you see it. That is a testament to Stanley Kubrick's ability, and Malcolm McDowell's hauntingly good performance.",7,0,1,26 November 2011
Psycho," Classic Thriller
","'Psycho' is perhaps the best horror film of all time, directed by the best horror director of all time, Alfred Hitchcock. It has a simple plot, and to describe the events that take place would be quick work, but the suspense and fear the film creates can not be described. Hitchcock was masterful. His direction of this film made something as pedestrian as a police officer approaching a car, or taking a hot shower fill you with a sense of fear and trepidation. Hitchcock let the suspense build throughout the film, while the plot twisted and turned until the shocking climax, that I'm sure no one saw coming. Anthony Perkins was wonderful as the quiet Norman Bates, and the rest of the cast was solid. This film was Hitchcock's magnum opus, that embodied movie making at its finest. From camera work, to acting, to plot, Hitchcock made a film that defines what quality is, while tantalizing and scaring you more than you would think possible.",Null,0,0,8 November 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Great Film
","One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest was one of the best, if not most depressing films I have ever seen. Jack Nicholson is superb as McMurphy, a charismatic man that fakes mental illness to get out of jail, and instead ends up in a mental hospital. The head nurse in the hospital, Nurse Ratched, played wonderfully by Louise Fletcher is a hard, vindictive woman that is McMurphy's constant antagonist. Nicholson and Fletcher won the Oscar's for best actor and actress for this film, which also claimed Best Picture, and Best Director. The supporting cast was equally strong, especially Danny DeVito, Christopher LLoyd, and Will Sampson as Chief. McMurphy's different views and easy way begin to help the other patients progress. McMurphy grows more and more frustrated with Ratched's strict ways and defies her more and more until things come to a head and Nurse Ratched wins out. She has him lobotomized and turned into a vegetable. Chief mercifully kills his friend and escapes the hospital. The film is a sad, but important look into mental illness, the difficulties in treating it, and the failures of the system we had in place at the time. It is easily one of the best films of all time and despite the serious subject matter, it is a must see film.",9,1,2,10 December 2011
