Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It was too hyped, therefore disappointing...
","I am the last person one would think of as prudish; however, there was something about this film that just left me flat, and I can't put my finger on what it was. This surprised me, since I've been a fan of 'Da Ali G Show' from day one. But this movie was vulgar - I thought it made the low-brow comedy classic 'Animal House' look elegant by comparison! There were parts that made me laugh, but all in all, I was disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high. And I really thought the jokes about the Jewish folks were in particularly poor taste (I'm not one of those overly sensitive types either, for racial slams say more about the person doing the insulting than they do about anyone else). The only comedian I've ever seen do racial humor really, really well is Carlos Mencia, and that's because a. he's really funny; b. he leaves NO ONE out, and c. he also pokes fun at his own race. To pick on one group to the exclusion of everyone else is just sometimes in poor taste, as it was in this film. I doubt I'll ever watch it again.",5,0,2,7 March 2007
The Sound of Music," One of my all-time favorites!
","This film has to be in my top 5 all-time favorite movies. The singing, the spirituality, the scenery - there is something amazing in this film for everyone. Yes, Hollywood, films without violence and bad language can be wildly popular (even though I am a firm believer in free speech and that there are times for which an expletive (sp?) is certainly called). This film also recalls a time when it was made quite clear that if you didn't stand for something, that you may be in mortal danger of falling for anything, i.e. Hitler's insanity. Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrew's performances here are without equal. This is the perfect family film!",10,1,7,30 December 2007
Legends of the Fall," Any film with a ferret in it...
",".. is all right by me! But this gorgeous epic tale that was given but 2 stars on the comcast system has crushed any faith I had in critics opinions. This movie SO deserved (and won) the Oscar for cinematography - it is a five star visual feast and is done much more justice on a large screen than anywhere else. The cast is spectacular, and whomever it was that casted the roles as they did simply could not have chosen better actors than they did. This was my first encounter w/ Aidan Quinn, whom I've adored ever since, and Brad Pitt IS Tristan. Anthony Hopkins was perfect as the Colonel, the patriarch of the family. This film makes me wish I'd have moved south and gotten into the 'business' vs. staying up here and squandering my talents in the Sillycon Valley (still the Santa Clara Valley to those of us who are natives). This must have been a fun and enchanting set on which to toil. It also (the film) has my eternal respect for the honor and respect it pays to those who's land upon which we thrive, the Native Americans. This is a wonder of a film, nothing else like it out there. I am so grateful to all who put their hearts and souls into its creation.",10,0,2,27 October 2007
Invincible," Can't say enough about this film!!!
","I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! I met Dick Vermeil in '75 when he was recruiting my h.s. boyfriend to play for UCLA just prior to his leaving for Philly - nice guy (but the boyfriend went w/ Mike White at Cal - GO BEARS!). Dick is a class act; that he gave the time of day to me, a high school wide receiver's girlfriend says something about the man.** SPOILER ALERT ** Thank you, too, Mark Wahlberg! Excellent performance. I felt the despair of Vince after his (short-sighted) wife left him so clearly. And the uncertainty of laying it all on the line to try out for your beloved Eagles; that was amazing. You all were faithful to that mid-70's vibe as well. It was huge for me that you included Jackson Browne's These Days as part of the soundtrack. That was one of my top two favorite songs in high school. The whole local boy makes good thing is always a joy to behold. This film has heart and soul and it bothers me that on comcast it rates only 2 stars (who are these critics, anyway?!?) - I'd give it a solid three and a half. If you love football and like a great underdog story, then this is the film for you! I so enjoyed it and send my thanks to all involved!",8,2,2,12 September 2007
Pretty Woman," I adore this film!
","I still get tears in my eyes 16 years later when Miss Julia steps into the lobby in that red dress - she is simply breathtaking (and I'm a woman, no less!). This movie has a charm that so many other works just do not capture. It is, and always will be, one of my faves, in my top 20. I mean, you don't have to be a hooker to know what being disrespected by a man feels like, you know? I think that is it's feminine appeal. For men, it's as simple as JULIA ROBERTS (at least that's what I've been told). That's Mrs. Moder to the rest of us. Another thing is what woman hasn't dreamed of just one day crossing paths with that certain someone who sees the beauty and value and unique characteristics we each possess? The writer of this script really gets it. Love it love it LOVEIT!!!",10,0,3,11 July 2006
It's a Wonderful Life," My Favorite Movie Ever, Ever, Ever!!!
","Bless Frank Capra for this most excellent, hopeful, hope-filled film! The themes are eternal: 'Don't give up 5 minutes before the miracle,' and 'suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem,' and even, 'yes, in fact, miracles do happen.' I agree with another contributor's comments in that it is not Christmas until we've watched 'It's A Wonderful Life!' Because, in fact, it is a wonderful life, corny as that may sound in such a cynical and treacherous time as we live in. The only part that is still so very difficult for me to watch is the scene with the druggist (when George has yet to deliver those pills). I won't spoil it for anyone who's not yet seen it, but it speaks volumes of a different time that has thankfully, for a lot of folks (sadly, not everyone), passed.This film also cemented Jimmy Stewart as my all time favorite actor (yes, I cried when he passed). He and Donna Reed were just about perfectly cast, at least I can't think of a better pairing. And I cry every single time I see this amazing work of art. It is truly a must-see, one-of-a-kind quaintly classic movie and a priceless gem. And a real Christmas miracle kind of film. Everyone should see it, at least once, even if you must watch it chopped up by commercial interruptions on a major network (yes, I'll go even that far!!!).",10,0,4,14 December 2007
Casino Royale," I just wish that Clooney had been cast as Bond
","Yes, this is a fine movie, but to me, Craig is simply NOT believable as James Bond. I mean, blonde Bond?!? Come on! Personally, I think George Clooney was born to the role (yet, I've NO idea whatsoever if the role was offered to him or if he'd even be interested in playing it). Clooney would be the perfect blend of Sean Connery's rugged yet sophisticated manner, coupled with Roger Moore's good looks (yes, I prefer the old school Bond, although Pierce Brosnan was perfectly likable as 007). I will always watch the Bond films, regardless of who plays the role; it's just that I'd possess a whole lot more enthusiasm for the film if I agreed with the casting choice for our favorite Bollinger sipping, martini swilling secret agent. I do hope the powers that be will re-think their casting choice. Lastly, and I say this sincerely, Mr. Craig, I mean you no offense, for I think you are a very talented actor and have enjoyed a number of your films.",7,3,7,18 November 2006
