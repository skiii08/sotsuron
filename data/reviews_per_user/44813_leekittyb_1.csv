Catch Me If You Can," Great movie! A+!
","This movie was excellent.  Being a huge fan of Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks--what could go wrong?  Nothing! This movie was a great depiction of the true story and great acting.  I suggest that everyone should see it.  With a touch of comedy, it keeps the film flowing in a good direction! Bravo Spielberg!",Null,0,0,26 December 2002
