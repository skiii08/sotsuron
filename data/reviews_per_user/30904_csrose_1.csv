Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Most obscene movie ever
","If you have one grain of a value system you will boycott this movie. It is disturbing that it can be shown in public theaters. I have been less offended by pornographic films during my college days than this film. What does it take to be rated X nowadays. to you who found this amusing , reevaluate you ethics, This film offends anyone with a moral value system or a since of humanity. This film mocks society and people in a way that goes way beyond humor. I was looking forward to seeing a comedy and was embarrassed to be seen in the theater watching this film. I wish somebody would have told me how bad it was before I took my wife on a date to this awful movie",1,12,25,13 December 2006
