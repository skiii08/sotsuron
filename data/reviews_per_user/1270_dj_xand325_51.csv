Deja Vu," A Solid and Cunning Film
","'What if you had to tell someone the most important thing in the world, but you knew they'd never believe you?' This is a very well made movie and the acting is very convincing and believable. However, there are very many unrealistic values that involve this movie. Clearly the whole idea of looking back in time with the technology we have now is definitely impossible....but afterall it is a movie Although there are some unrealism and plot holes i would still count this as a solid and enjoyable movie then entertains the whole way through.7/10",7,4,7,10 August 2007
Chinatown," A melancholic and detailed showcase of noir. Chinatown is a triumph
","Chinatown is a complex and beautifully woven detective story directed by the superb Roman Polanski. It sees PI Jake Gettes (Jack Nicholson) plunge into a case of political conspiracy, heartless hypocrisy and shocking dysfunction. Evelyn Mulwray's (Faye Dunaway) husband has died and Gettes is trying to uncover who's behind it.Its well-paced, masterfully detailed and flawlessly directed by Polanski. Nicholson was perfect for the role as the smooth Jake Gettes. Dunaway was also superb as the seriously troubled Evelyn Mulwray.The overall theme of the film is misguided help which always seem to happen in Chinatown. Recurring events happen in Gettes' life in which his help doesn't work and he simply makes things worse. The conclusion of the film is cold and upsetting as Gettes' help ceases to work once again.This film is about harsh injustice and ironic redemption.Well Woven Story.Thought Provoking Twists.Excellent Noir.8.5/10",8,1,2,25 October 2008
Citizen Kane," One of the finest films ever made, an integral piece of cinema
","Citizen Kane is an influential, dynamically important piece of cinema that has paved the way for the spectacular world of cinema we now know and adore.Orson Welles is an icon of film, his script was ominous, satisfying, bold and hugely ahead of its time. The jigsaw puzzle storyline was crafted exquisitely and the paradoxical mysteriousness of 'Rosebud' was daring.The direction and cinematography was excellent and even dazzling at times. The film flows vividly and there were some wonderful shots. A great one is a shot near the start of the film where Kane's mother is talking to Mr Thatcher and there is a view of Kane playing outside the house in the snow. A haunting shot.Citizen Kane holds its helm at the top of AFI top 100 films of all time. Whether i agree with this is questionable. However, this film is hugely influential, its iconic style is a first. One film in particular where I can see its influence is There will be blood. Similar story of a man building a business and eventually crumbling from power.Citizen Kane is simply stunning 10/10",10,0,1,4 October 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's epic black comedy. Inglourious Basterds is a sprawling, rhapsodic, triumphant, ridiculously original cinematic experience
","<ul><li>Tarantino is possibly the greatest cult director to ever live - </li></ul>Originality and Passion is something that is relatively scarce in the contemporary film industry, many directors now simply produce films for the whopping pay check after release (Michael Bay, Jason Friedberg...). Yet, Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is a gleaming example that there is still raw passion and bundles of originality nestled in the undercurrents of cinema. Tarantino's films most definitely have an acquired taste, his style is marred with obscure film references, heavy dialogue, dark comedy and you'd usually expect his characters to go into a burst of pointless chit-chat about pop culture. This is what his cinema is and he sticks to his guns, he's not tempted by the majority audience to cash in on. The beauty of Inglourious Basterds is that he sticks to his style, but he puts it into a totally different use to produce a wacky piece of cinema of the like that I've never seen before or never will!Inglourious Basterds is split into five chapters that all have a distinct tone and direction. It involves two bloody stories of revenge and redemption coming together in a simply outrageous fashion. Melanie Laurent plays Shoshana Dreyfus, a vengeful cinema owner who witnessed her family get massacred by Nazi Colonel, Hans 'Jew Hunter' Landa (Christophe Waltz). Whilst, Brad Pitt plays Lt Aldo Raine as he leads a battalion of hate-filled American Jews on a rampage to kill Nazis. Both stories unite in a simply epic conclusion. Once again, Tarantino gathers an admirable cast that fit the script. Waltz pulled off a great performance that should expect Academy recognition, Pitt was very good as the simple American lieutenant and Laurent was perfect as Shoshana. I could only complain about Eli Roth, but I don't want to waste my time explaining why as the reasons should be obvious!Like a typical Tarantino film, there are flourishes of Morricone music, brilliant yet perhaps superfluous dialogue and plenty of violence. The film doesn't take itself seriously, it's just great fun and miles away from your normal war film. Tarantino treats sensitive issues like Nazism like anything else, producing a multitude of violence never seen before in his films. Inglourious Basterds is a black comedy, we find ourselves laughing when in fact we should be shocked and disgusted. Yet, this doesn't suggest the story is lousy, it's actually brilliant. It's ironic and surprisingly gripping, all thanks to a script that I would describe as spectacular. The writing is subtle and at times, hilarious. Tarantino's films have always been quite comical, yet this is his first all-out black comedy. The farcical story structure encapsulates a great atmosphere of stupidity, so much so that you can't help but laugh out loud at the end. The film is most certainly an acquired taste, some may find the heavy scenes of dialogue as excessive or some may see Tarantino's attempts at black humour as immature and juvenile. Opinions were always going to be polarised as they were at Cannes. But I can tell you one thing, Inglourious Basterds sees Tarantino back on blistering form and I can't wait for his next project. 'Tarantino's hilarious film is an epic celebration of cinema' 'Laurent and Waltz shine in the best film of the summer''Wildly Original. A crazy, twisted, bloody war film that certainly has its dramatic moments exemplified by Tarantino's exhilarating music choice' 'Awesome, Dazzling, Beautiful. Inglourious Basterds fails to disappoint''Entertainment of the highest calibre''Has everything you'd expect from a Tarantino film. An experience for both film buffs and the ordinary film goer' 'I can guarantee, no-one has seen anything like this before...'I've never had so much fun in the cinema.9/10",9,5,18,16 August 2009
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Mildly Funny, Moderately entertaining, A significantly average comedy
","Stoller's 'Forgetting Sarah Marshell' is quite an entertaining comedy that does have its dry moments along side funny moments, but for me, this is predominantly a very average comedy and somewhat over-rated by the IMDb and general public.Its basically about some guy being dumped by his superstar girlfriend and he takes very hard.Jason Segel pulled off an amusing performance as you would expect, his script was snappy, cool and well written despite the definite issues of pacing. Russell Brand was surprisingly good in his role as Aldous Snow. Slight hints of satire in his irreverent character.This film is very current and its aiming for a very current audience. There's an array of beautiful women, pop culture jokes (sex and the city joke was great) and crudeness. That is why this may not be for everyone.This is one level higher than Superbad but the dragging story and lack of hilarious comedy drags it down. I only found myself laughing out loud once at the beginning where Brand's character unites a Jew and an Arab as a sign of equality, other than this, I was only chuckling.5.3/10",5,5,12,26 September 2008
12 Angry Men," Exquisite, Effortless Brilliance
","12 Angry Men - Top 15 films of all time Sidney Lumet's masterpiece follows a group of 12 jurors deciding the fate of a young teenage in a case that is seemingly overwhelmingly against him. The votes start 11 to 1 in favour of guilty and the one juror (Henry Fonda) seems adamant that he is not guilty. Remarkably the whole 96 minutes take place in the jury room, its ever so simple but captivating throughout which is why this film deserves its mounted praise and my standings of it as being up there with Hitchcock's Vertigo.Fonda pulled off a blistering and powerful performance playing the rebel of jury. He is the only one that has any belief in this seemingly condemned soul. But he teaches one important lesson that nothing is rarely as it seems. He manages to convince 11 other men of the jury that this man isn't guilty. A remarkable feat.This is one of the few films that can truly be labelled as a timeless classic, this didn't need action or special effects, just sheer cinematic brilliance that shines through the flawless script and the dynamic direction.Not only is the film convincing, its frivolously entertaining and a true milestone in cinematic history Perfection 10/10",10,0,0,13 August 2008
Spider-Man 3," Definitive Superhero Film
","'It's Brock sir, Edward Brock Jr. I'm here humbled and humiliated to ask you for one thing... I want you to kill Peter Parker ' This film is an action packed superhero flick which delivers what any superhero film requires to deliver. Superb sequences of actions with a sprinkle of iconic storyline.The first spiderman was the worst in my opinion. But it did well to introduce the trilogy. The second spiderman was a brilliant installment of the trilogy. But i personally think this spiderman is simply the best of the series so far (hopefully) There was a lot of speculation on whether the film could be able to deliver a good way of shuffling the 3 villains together. However, the story proved this speculation wrong and the story was well crafted. I don't want to go too into the story or the ending, its for you to see.The only bad points of the film is the fact that we didn't get to see more of Venom which was disappointing and there were a lot of far-fetched moments but then again, this is a superhero film! In conclusion, this is definitely the best superhero film ever made, towers over superman. A must see 8/10",7,0,1,18 October 2007
Milk," Sean Penn has pulled off an absolutely perfect performance in Van Sant's powerful biopic
","Gay Rights has slowly become a thing of the past in modern society as diversity stretches to the deepest crevices of any ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. Liberality is something that we take for granted indeed, yet society wasn't always liberal nor was it easy to gain it's liberality. People had to fightfor it, fight the government and most importantly fight for their reputation. Milk highlights the inspirational life of the first openly gay US government official, Harvey Milk and the struggle of homosexual acceptance in San Francisco and elsewhere in the USA.Harvey Milk was a simple man, claiming that he had turned 40 and hadn't done anything worthy. Yet after he and his boyfriend move to San Francisco, he suddenly becomes embroiled in a heart-felt battle to fight for Gay rights through mass protests and publicity stunts. Milk slowly gathers a huge following and eventually achieves title of the first openly gay government official.The carrier of this film is of course, Sean Penn. His performance was flawless, charming and completely magnanimous to the real persona of Harvey Milk. His mannerisms and body language have an outrageous similarity to Harvey Milk and Penn is by no means a camp man. Such in depth character study is extraordinary. Everything about Penn's performance was perfect, it wasn't overplayed and wasn't underplayed, just sheer perfection. In fact, I think Penn truly deserves the Oscar but I think Rourke's comeback performance in The Wrestler will get the Oscar, despite Rourke deserving it, I would prefer it to go to Penn.Van Sant's flamboyant direction was also wildly enjoyable, I loved his blend of real documentary footage with the non-linearity of the story telling. It was also an interesting choice for the ending of the story to be told in not only the beginning of the film but also in the promoting of the film. The producers did this because Milk's fate isn't the point of the film; the point of the film is to capture the inspiration in this story of one man overcoming a nation of prejudice, hate and discrimination.Milk illustrates the power of the gay rights movement in San Francisco whilst questioning our collective views of gays as victimised humans that are humans nonetheless.Milk is emotionally raw, visually magnificent and awesomely performed, 9/10",9,4,9,2 February 2009
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Burton's surreal, dark, gloomy musical masterpiece. A piece of art
","'I will have vengeance, I will have salvation!'I have never been a fan of musicals and felt that a person getting up and singing in the middle of a film was stupid and tedious. However, this is an exception Sweeney Todd is a bloody and gruesome story of a barber called Benjamin Parkerwho once lived a happy life with a beautiful wife and child. The judge then takes an interest in his wife and then wrongly convicts Parker to take his wife and daughter for himself. Parker is then sent adrift from London and returns years later seeking vengeance.To seek revenge he starts his barber shop back up by partnering with Mrs Lovett and her pie shop in the gloomy streets of London. Todd kills the people and Lovett makes the human pies!. He hopes that the judge and his accomplice will come for a shave!This is a very intriguing film that has awesome visuals and cinematography. Tim Burton has produced a visually fantastic film. The make-up is fantastic and retains the gritty feeling of the film fantastically. The ghostly white tint on every character's face is perfectly done.Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter produce an exceptional partnership on screen through both of them pulling off beautiful performances.The reason for the films 18 rating is because of the blood produced when Todd slits the peoples throats, the blood squirting is almost like the blood in kill bill in the sense that it stylised and somewhat unrealistic. It may be argued thats it inappropriate in kill bill but its very appropriate in this film because the film itself is set in an unrealistic and dramatised world of London. The extravagant blood squirting also makes the film more dramatic, especially when Todd finally kills the judge in a bloody frenzy.The film also has glimpses of comedy. My personal favourite comical moment in the film was when the 'by the sea' song was sung by Mrs lovett , when she is reminiscing about them relaxing on the beach, there is an hilarious shot of Todd in a black and white swimsuit sitting on a towel looking emotionless and bored. A great gag about how annoying woman ranting can be! The film features a library of very catchy and epic songs that i mostly (surprisingly) loved. My favourite song and scene of the film was when Todd sang 'Epiphany', i thought it was a very powerful representation of Todd's frustration and desire for revenge. On top of the that, the song was very catchy and the lyrics were awesome. I also loved the sequence where Todd and the judge sing 'pretty women', the whistling was eerie and slightly sadistic.------------SPOILERS----------- The ending of the film in which the beggar is found to be Sweeney's wife was genius in my opinion. The final scene was very well done although, i think that the child slitting Todd's throat could have been more dramatic, but thats my only criticism. The final shot was awesome and left me blown away at the only musical i would ever love.So why have i not given it a 10? Well although this is a film i loved, it is a musical and i cant bring myself to give a musical with a simplistic story higher than 8.5.Don't be scared off by the fact that its a musical, I HATE musicals but enjoyed this immensely 8.5/10",9,0,2,27 January 2008
Full Metal Jacket," A Superb , Sick and Deranged Masterpiece
",'I am in a world of sh*t' A quote that summarises the films theme and style and how the Vietnam war is presented in the film.Stanley Kubrick presents Joker's story through the Vietnam war perfectly. Joker is a marine who reports for a magazine. The fact that he is looking to find information and pictures of the Vietnam war is a clear representation of the film performing reflexivity.This is a film of two halves and two stories almost. One of them the story of Private Piles or Leonard in which Joker helps him through the gruelling process of marine training. The second is when Joker is actually in Vietnam and with a platoon.The film also has a very vivid and upbeat sound score which has juxtapositions towards the actions that are happening on screen. This ultimately works very Well.This is definitely one of the best war films I've ever seen. In my opinion a must see,9,0,2,8 August 2007
Burn After Reading," A Coen comedy of Shakespearian proportions. An American Farce
","Lsst year saw the Coens reach a new height of success with their multiple Oscar winning, gritty, tense and relentless masterpiece: No Country For old Men. This year they've gone for a more light hearted and comical addition to their film archive with Burn After Reading.To put it simply, its about some supposedly confidential CIA data that ends up in the hands of some low brow gym workers that want to sell it back to a CIA analyst. The story slowly unravels and the genius of the Coen's screenplay unfolds.The cast is simply fantastic. Brad Pitt, George Clooney, John Malkovich, Frances Mcdormand and Tilda Swinton. Whats unusual about this cast is that they all have a relatively equal role in the film rather than one actor given a leading role to push for an Oscar (like Brolin in W.). Its a film of supporting actors that pull off exceptional performances. In terms of Oscars, I could see Malkovich's portrayal of the clinically insane CIA analyst Osbourne Cox receiving a nomination and possibly Pitt's performance as the dim-witted Chad getting some notice. But all in all a group of convincing and hilarious performances. I could see the Coen's get a nomination for their script but I doubt the academy will give them the award twice in a row unfortunately but a nomination alone is enough to value its merit.The Coen's comedy is very dry and whats so clever about it is that the humour comes from very topical and trivial situations rather than the cheap comedy you get in spoofs etc. This is clever comedy. For example, Osbourne's over-swearing is oddly hilarious but all the Coen's are doing is presenting a natural reaction. It seems as if they haven't gone out of their way to include the comedy in the script, the comedy speaks for itself in the characters.Now lets take a step back from the specifics of the film. To put it bluntly, this film is a series of mishaps, follies and misunderstanding between a bunch of incongruous characters. Much like Shakespeare's 'Much ado about nothing', this film is about nothing, being made a big deal.I may be jumping the gun here, but I do see this as modern Shakespeare. The nature and unusualness of the story seems to match the quality of Shakespeare's 'Much ado about nothing' and possibly some of his other poems. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a complex drama but the irony of the story just cries Shakespeare to me. Also, the governmental satire seems to hint Kubrick's Dr Strangelove which is also a film of mishaps met with stupidity.The Coen's have devised a very smart piece of comedy. I see this as the 'Much ado about nothing' and 'Dr Strangelove' of our time, met with the usual high standards of direction and cinematography with the Coen's Apologies if the reference to Shakespeare appears pretentious as I don't want to present this as a pretentious film. Its a fun, crazy and dryly hilarious.Absolutely excellent film 8.4/10",8,2,6,24 October 2008
American Psycho," A cold, heartless grotesquely brilliant psychologically demanding film
","American Psycho is a flaringly unique film that follows the mind warping story of Patrick Bateman. A psychologically troubled man that on the surface is a successful gentleman yet behind the scenes he has alarming temptations that involve blood and torture.I feel you would be underselling the film to call it a slasher, this is much better than a slasher. This is a psychological investigation of the mind of a deeply troubled individual. Sure there are scenes that nod towards slasher movies but there are also glimpses of inventive, artistic film-making that some how puts us onto the same level of this American Psycho. Empathy it produces? Perhaps. But thats not the point, this shuddering film presents temptation from the inside rather than the outside. This is where this film succeeds and gains its reputation as more than a slasher movie.Harron's direction is both stirring and comprehensive. Bale proves himself to be a very worthy actor with his adaptation of Ellis' disturbed character. Obsession is all his character is about. Ruthless obsession, taking over his life.American Psycho is a dynamically original gem of a film that is both coarse and thought provoking 8/10",8,3,7,31 August 2008
North by Northwest," Hitchcock's masterpiece of entertainment
","-North By Northwest- Top 5 Hitchcock Films North By Northwest follows the unfortunate series of events that happen to high street advertising agent Roger Thornhill. Roger's a charismatic, sarcastic and smooth individual that is strung into a extraordinary trail of events that leaves him hugely dislocated. Hes used as a ploy agent by the government to prevent Vandamm noticing the real spy spying on them.Thornhill then finds himself being pursued across America. Along the way, Thornhill also confronts some mysterious romance.North by Northwest is one of the Hitchcock's most famous films mostly due to the brilliant and iconic sequence where Thornhill is chased by a plane. Ernest Lehman's punchy script mixed with Hitchcock's flawless talent to create easing tension makes North By Northwest a masterpiece.It achieves on all levels. Its an entertaining adventure,there's comedy, there's romance , there's an amazing storyline mixed with plenty of twists. Cary Grant was great as the unfortunate advertising tycoon, he was both sombre and comical.Hitchcock produces another Gem with North By Northwest, a little more light hearted than his other masterpieces, Vertigo and The Birds.9/10",9,2,4,19 August 2008
The Shining," A beautifully perplexing masterpiece of horror 10/10
","'Nothin'. There ain't nothing' in Room 237. But you ain't got no business going' in there anyway. So stay out. You understand? Stay out.' Never has there been such a feat of psychological horror as this film achieves. This is the highest rated horror film of all and rightly so. Jack nicholson is a superb actor and this is one of the greatest performances in cinema.Its about a family moving to an isolated and deserted hotel for 5 months over the winter. Then the father (Jack) becomes almost possessed by the horrors in the hotel.Kubricks direction is nothing short then perfect. The tense tracking shots, agonising music, mystical messages and perplexing plot makes this the best horror film ever made.Throughout the film there is constant references to danger, death and horror. Red is used in EVERY scene. Is the red purposely put in by Kubrick? Of course!.This is a definitive Kubrick classic and this is the third of his films I have given 10/10. He is a perfectionist in his direction and you can see it in all his films. He loves to perplex his watchers in everyone of his films.I will be talking about this film for months to come. It has infinite depth.In conclusion, this is the cornerstone of horror and tension. A masterpiece of terror 10/10",10,3,5,12 November 2007
Apocalypse Now," A cold, questioning, twisted ,incomprehensible masterpiece.
","The Vietnam war genre has become proliferated throughout the cinematic world. The repertoire of Vietnam films is vast. Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, Platoon. Yet Apocalypse Now is not only the best Vietnam film, it is the best war film I have ever seen and ranks as one of the most mesmerising films ever created.Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's superb novella: 'Heart of Darkness'; Coppola's adaptation is both reasonably faithful and demandingly original. In a way, this is a reinvented and rethought version of Conrad's book. Coppola is subtle with his particular references to the book.Coppola's daring direction and chilling music makes this film an experience to say the least. You experience the horrors of the Vietnam War as the alpha-male group of soldiers trudge up this river famously described as a snake uncoiled in Conrad's novella. Apocalpse Now is also one of my favourite beginnings of a film. The chilling blend of REM and the jungle's exploding in flames was the best possible way to open the film.I would love to say what exactly this film is about in a deeper manner but its just too difficult. It raises issues about the morals of the war, the treatment of soldiers and the government's view of the soldiers.Apocalypse Now is an astonishing war film. It has the depth and maximised style to rank as one of the greatest films ever made.I preferred this to Godfather.10/10",10,1,2,13 November 2008
Edward Scissorhands," Edward Scissorhands is benevolent to the core yet shunned by a misunderstanding society. Burton's stylised fairy tale is one of grand emotional bravado
","Tim Burton's 'Edward Scissorhands' is a beautifully constructed modern fairy-tale detailing the life of an unfinished humanoid named Edward. His inventor died before he could complete Edward so he is left with a frightening set of razor sharp blades for hands. Edward remains isolated in the darkness of his inventor's hilltop mansion until a kind Avon lady comes to him and offers to let him stay in her house within a sickly prim, proper and perfect suburban neighbourhood where your every move is judged by the unforgiving inhabitants. Unexpectedly, Edward finds a love interest yet his naive inability to distinguish between right and wrong leads to him slowly being denounced by the neighbourhood.Johnny Depp is simply an astonishing actor. His character of Edward is heart-warming and extremely lovable. With very little dialogue to work with, Depp's body language is perfect, embodying Edward as shy but very benevolent. He carries the film in a performance that would withstand his position as one of the most versatile actors in the history of cinema. Perhaps he could have got an Oscar nomination for his performance. Burton has never been one of the most conventional film-makers and 'Edward Scissorhands' is no exception. Elfman's haunting track is brilliant over the almost clichéd fairy tale shots of the great mansion on the hill. This film is almost like Burton's homage to all fairy-tales or rather a telling of his very own. Such a film will always be open for any interpretation in terms of meaning. It could be a satire about the crushing effects of judgmental American suburbia or some see Edward as a metaphor for Jesus. However outlandish you want to go with your interpretation of the film, 'Edward Scissorhands' is a great mystical film that is surprisingly poignant. 8/10",8,0,0,6 July 2009
The Exorcist," 'May the power of Christ compel you!'
","Friedkin has produced possibly the most controversial film of all time with his petrifying tale of a girl being possessed by the devil. This film was released in 1973 and quickly became the most feared movie of all time. No-one had ever seen such scenes of religious slander and coarse sexual language. I find it simply extraordinary how this film could have possibly been released to the extremely touchy audience of the early 70s. Afterall, this film is terrifying compared to any modern horror film i have ever seen and this is quite possibly the scariest film of all time however, this doesn't make it the best horror film of all time.The story follows the story of a girl being possessed by the devil and her devastated mother trying to get her exorcised. This leads to a climatic ending.This film is renowned for its spectacular imagery created by the make-up. Linda Blair was made to look as horrifying as possible with her famous make-up. Furthermore, the editing at times was brilliant. Unexpected flashes of weird faces are sure to terrify the audience without them even anticipating it. Such psychological horror is what all horror films should utilise rather then the 'gore gore gore' prerogative most contemporary horror films go by. Such psychological horror is what makes a brilliant horror movie.Moreover, the film has many cool subtleties that you would expect from a 70s film such as the fact that early in the film Regan hints towards using a ouiji board which of course prepares the audience for later in the film and possibly provides some sort of reason for this satanic possession.Anyway, despite the films obvious horror value, I feel that although it may the scariest film of all time it is far from the best horror film. What film gains with scares it lacks with enough substance and thought. For example, the shining is most probably one of the most thought provoking films of all time alongside psycho's amazing plot twist at the end. Therefore, as a film the exorcist isn't particularly breath-taking but because of its controversial and shocking theme it is slightly over-rated. Sometimes we should step back and look at a film as a film not a theme.Horror seekers should see this simply because it is a milestone of cinema. A powerful film of visceral proportions.8.2/10",8,0,1,6 August 2008
Tropic Thunder," A fun, hilarious, irreverent, full blown satire of Hollywood
","Tropic Thunder is an excellent satirical gem made by the prolific Ben Stiller. Its about an uneven group of actors that attempt to film a war film in Vietnam and through a series of events their filming turns into a race for their lives as they stumble across REAL bad guys.Stiller has produced a type of film that I have never seen before. It isn't just a series of parodies, its a series of satire. If you like, this is an 'epic movie' type film with quality. The film references are subtle, the satire is subtle and unsubtle at times, its perfectly balanced. A top quality series of comedy that is sure to please anybody that has ever seen a Hollywood film before.The only direct satire I could spot was Downey Jr's character. Its most probably Daniel Day Lewis or Russell Crowe. Also Downey Jr's performance was excellent. Hes possibly the most believable fake black guy I have ever seen!.Tropic Thunder is a controversial blend of outrageous one-liners, sharp satire and laugh out loud comedy.Hollywood has finally been effectively mocked! 7.5/10",7,0,2,20 September 2008
No Country for Old Men," Winner of 4 Oscars...A True Masterpiece of Modern Cinema
","2008 Oscars:BEST PICTURE BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR - JAVIER BARDEM BEST DIRECTOR - THE COEN BROTHERSAfter reading about the film and seeing what great feedback its had in America i really looked forward to seeing it and it wasn't a disappointment! Its a story of a hunter called llewlyn who finds a group of trucks, corpses, heroin and a big stash of money. He takes the money and is then pursued by a mass murderer called Anton whose equipped with a deadly oxygen pump! Also involved is the sheriff trying to help llewelyn and his wife from being caught and killed by Anton.This is a very continuous film which is at points very tense. The satchel that Llewlyn has the money in has a detector in it so that Anton would be able to locate it at anytime. This fact leads to a very tense sequence in which Llewlyn finds the detector and moments later hears footsteps outside his motel room which is Anton, there to kill him and take the money.In theory, the story is very simple. A man being pursued for a load of money by a psychopath. But this is made original with the fantastic script and perfect direction by the Coen Brothers. My personal favourite scene was when Anton speaks to a shopkeeper in a small Texas shop. Its a conversation where Anton eerily explores the shopkeepers personal life and tries to play a game of luck with him by flipping a coin and asking him to call heads or tails. Anton says its for everything. The shopkeeper picks the right side but it was obvious that he was playing for his life and therefore it shows an early showing of how evil Anton is and that he is capable of anything. Fantastic Scripting and Characterisation! The film also manages to leave unanswered questions such as whether Anton actually killed Llewlyn's wife and what was Anton being arrested for in the beginning and furthermore, what is the significance of the car crash?. These are all questions that can only be answered by the audience by linking with the theme of the film.Although the film is mostly dialogue, it still manages to entertain and keep audiences on the edge of their seat.This will without doubt be in the top 5 films this year and is most probably one of my top 10 favourite films...unmissable film 10/10",10,1,3,19 January 2008

The Pianist," Haunting and Harrowing Masterpiece...Stunning account of the holocaust
","'It's an official decree, no Jews allowed in the parks. ' This is oneof the two stunning holocaust films brought to us by a director of big quality, Roman Polanski We are presented with the true story of polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Its a powerful story of determination, hope, freedom and pride.He loses his family, has his religion disgraced, but he survives This continuous film is a superb study in how the holocaust developed and how much it devastated the Jewish community of Poland in world war 2.Although people may say that schindlers list is undoubtedly superior, they are very different films. One is a study a jew in the holocaust and the other is a study of a German in the holocaust. Schindlers List is stylistically superior but The Pianist manages to form a vision of how the holocaust developed and increasingly devastated an innocent Jewish family.It also presents other elements of the holocaust such as the extermination of disabled people in which a group of Nazis is shown raiding a Jewish home, a person in a wheelchair is tipped over a balcony, the rest of the family are then murdered. This is one of the most depressing and dark scenes of cinema i have ever seen, the fact that Szpilman's family is watching the whole thing with horror, makes you be able to empathise with the situation they are in and therefore maximises mental devastation to the watcher.Although i didn't cry in the film, it is still a harrowing masterpiece and any faint hearted person would be extremely moved by the film.9/10",9,1,2,26 November 2007
Revolutionary Road," Revolutionary Road is a depressing, tragic, immaculate, powerful force of a film.
","Sam Mendes shocked us in 1999 with his magnificent study of American Suburbia with American Beauty. He's come back onto our screens with Revolutionary Road, a shocking retelling of Richard Yates' novel. It tells the story of the seemingly perfect family, the Wheelers. They have 2 children, live within a very respectable neighbourhood, financially secure and seem externally to have a very loving relationship. Yet with Mendes (like American Beauty), nothing is ever as it seems and we see how Frank and April's relationship becomes jaded, empty and hopeless. April is a failed actress who spends her days tending for the house while Frank has a job that he can't stand. They're relationship is dysfunctional and Mendes maximises the devestating effect of this with the flashbacks of when they were newly weds which creates a profound contrast.Frank and April have an opportunity to break out of this monotonous, vacuous lifestyle they live in by moving into Paris yet the arrival of a pregnancy and higher job hopes for Frank leads to this immature dream deteriorating which leads to a tragic conclusion.This film is beautiful, visually and contextually. It presents the superficiality of American Suburbia that covers up the empty, cold lives these people lead. Dicaprio and Winslet were the highlight of the film. Their performances were sensational, Dicaprio's tour de force performance was vehement, passionate yet at times poignant. Winslet's performance was whimsical and truly flawless. The most important thing was the chemistry of these two characters, this withstood outstandingly throughout the film, which was of course helped by Winslet and Dicaprio's partnering in Titanic around a decade ago.Winslet and Dicaprio reunite in Mendes' beautiful film about the crushing effects of post WW2 American Suburbia. American Suburbia has been given another swipe by Sam Mendes, and hes looking as bold and brilliant as ever 9/10",9,0,1,31 January 2009
Schindler's List," A movie you must watch before you die
","This is a brilliant film that presents the holocaust and its evil horrors in an epic way that reaches into the viewers hearts and perhaps allows the viewer to empathise with the Jewish Victims.I myself am a Jew and seeing as my ancestors were in the holocaust, i am more emotionally attached to the movie then some other people. This is a film you need to see before you die and you will never truly understand the holocaust until you see this film The acting is near enough perfect, the direction is perfect.The poetic image of the girl in the red dress is heart wrenchingly emotional and it presents how much every single one of the Jews suffered in the holocaust.The only problem i have with the movie is that it took a small while to get started and the text at the end is hard to read.In Conclusion, this is a film everyone on the earth should see. Its one of the greatest films of all time. Enjoy!",10,9,14,5 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A sweeping odyssey, Fincher's epic is film of the year
","It is often clichéd that Oscar-winning films should be complex, questioning and deep yet Benjamin Button is a outstanding rebuttal to this cliché. Fincher's film is extremely simple whether it the direction or the story, this is because this is a simple story of a simple man living a simple but ultimately tragic life. This premise was constantly interesting; the thought of being born old and growing younger, certainly a mind-blowing concept. Button experiences both love and sadness as he watches his family and friends age older and he age younger.This film achieves on both a technical level and a cinematic level. As the film progresses, the astonishing visual effect and make-up allow for a truly realistic and believable depiction of what an older and younger Brad Pitt would look like. In fact, the special effects were flawless. Cinematically, the audience is thrown through a plethora of emotions including pity, laughter, sadness and happiness. In that sense, the film is well-rounded. The plot was enticing, the art direction was stunning and the performances were excellent especially Brad Pitt.Overall, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' can be perceived as a tragedy, Button's outrageous disease holds him back from leading a fulfilling life that he deserves and wants. This is what made the ending provoke shock, poignancy and reflection of life as a whole and how we should live and appreciate it.'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is a 21st century epic; concentrated, illustrious yet outstandingly simple. A tour de force of cinema that is no doubt the best picture of the year.10/10",10,2,4,7 February 2009
Transformers," Michael Bay you've done it again!
","This film is based on a series of cartoons that were released 20 years ago. Therefore this was a risky thing for Bay to take on due to all the old fans of it that he could disappoint.Although the transformers cartoon series wasn't in my time, i still watched a few of my brothers old videos of it and began to enjoy it. Due to this fact i can safely say that this film was a significant disappointment.The film focuses too much onto the lives on the humans rather then the robots. The characters are poorly developed and are in turn, are clichéd and crude. Shia labeouf's character (sam) is a typical American teenager who happens to be chucked into the story. Sam is alongside another flop of a character played by Megan Fox. She plays a blunt and pointless and character who is only there for eye candy (although i don't mind). Much like other Bay films, the army characters are big tough guys who will kill and shoot everything in sight. There's even a cheesy sub-plot for one of the soldiers of him wanting to go home and hug is new-born child. The character's have been hand-picked from pearl harbour and American pie and chucked into a cage with some big machines. This doesn't work.As for the story, well the lack of story. the story is about a war between the autobots and the decepticons about capturing a cube which holds the ultimate power. The whole of mankind is at stake. the story is very poor and is very unfaithful to the cartoon.Michael Bay is the king of americanising films and this is what hes done to the transformers series. Hes threw in some slow motion, unfunny humour and boy loves girl into one film thats meant to be a sci-fi thriller.This is not a sci-fi thriller like its supposed to be, its a teen flick with some robots in it.I've said a lot of bad about the film but i give it 3/10, why? Well i thought that the visuals and cinematography were at times breathtaking and intense. The fight scenes were fantastic and they were in my opinion the only good scenes of the film.While this film is watchable, the flurry of cliché's and the extremely unoriginal storyline and characterisation were simply too much for me to really enjoy this film. Bay brought a fantastic idea to mediocrity.We're bombarded with stylish visuals but there's a serious lack of originality3/10",3,2,6,27 January 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill is a masterful audio-visual nirvana. Tarantino has crafted a truly inspired piece of entertainment
","Quentin Tarantino's, 'Kill Bill' series, is a roaring revenge story about a trained killer (Uma Thurman) picking off the assassins group who brutally massacred her future family, including her unborn baby. The story is simple but don't be fooled, Tarantino's dual epic is a masterpiece of cinematic art, beeming with visual vibrancy, stunning cinematography and spine-chilling music.Tarantino is renowned for his vivacious love of obscure cinema, most notably kung fu and western cinema. In that context, 'Kill Bill' is by far his most inspired picture - the film in its entirety is a rich homage to Bruce Lee and Sergio Leone. Tarantino describes Kill Bill as his spaghetti western, his gritty saga of deceit and gore. That would sum up the atmospheric power of the films.As mentioned before, Kill Bill is a dual epic. Split into two films for the interest of having a sensible film length. Yet the difference between the two volumes isn't just the name. They differ hugely in style. Volume 1 is a more stylised orgy of violence and black comedy with simply chilling show-downs and minimal exposition. Where as, Volume 2 is a more mature piece of cinema, telling the full story of 'The Bride'. In this way, we as viewers get the best of both worlds, boundless entertainment and a smiggen of story.Volume 1 was always going to be a film that polarised critics. Style over substance was evident and unless a stuffy critic was willing to let his hair down and enjoy himself then he would have hated it. That is what you have to do, relax and admire the art of the film. Everything from the astonishing shot where we see Vernita's daugther's bus arrive through the window to the final showdown between O'Ren and The Bride is shot with depth and passion. Tarantino is meticulous in his direction, like 'Pulp Fiction', he pays attention to detail. The music is thrilling; Tarantino opts for Funky music types matched with aggressive Morricone scores, a combination you wouldn't think would work but it's invariably pulled off.What's great about Volume 1 is that it doesn't take itself seriously, some of the scenes are just so outrageous that we know it's meta-cinema, we know we're watching a film in another world. Cinema is one of the finest forms of escapism and Kill Bill embraces that quality to the maximum! This is presented both subtly and boldly resulting in a satisfying film to watch multiple times (which I have).'Kill Bill: Volume 1' is awesomely entertaining, cinematographic art and marvellously inspired.Absolutely stunning.9/10",9,1,3,10 August 2007
From Dusk Till Dawn," Two best friends come together to make a fun, eccentric modern B-movie that i thoroughly enjoyed!
","Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino met at the Cannes film festival (when Tarantino won best picture for pulp fiction) and they got talking and found out they had similar film interest. Rodriguez said to Tarantino that he would love to make a horror film in Mexico and alas Tarantino had already written the script and offered Rodriguez to direct it!. Almost a natural bond between the two that has amounted to the production of this bloody, fun and quixotic b-movie that is 'From Dusk till Dawn' Its a film of two parts, one part is the saga of the criminal gecko brothers (Tarantino and clooney) trying to get into Mexico and away from the American law where they can pursue a happy life. In order to do this, they abduct an innocent family who are grieving the death of their mother/wife who recently died tragically. They're fragile and weak so being abducted by two psycho criminals isn't the ideal treatment for them!. It also becomes apparent that Richard Gecko (Tarantino) has an ardent sexual desire for the young girl of the family. Tarantino plays a sick deranged and mentally disturbed character that seems to be a sexual offender. While Seth Gecko (clooney) seems to be more calculated and clever than Richard, he is still criminal trash that only cares about himself and his brother. The Geckos hide the families bathroom in their caravan and force them to go through the Mexican/American border. This first part is a sample of some typical quick, crisp and stimulating script work from Tarantino that is a true joy to watch.Now onto the second part, after arriving into Mexico, they are told to meet a friend at a sick bar called the 'titty twister'. The bar turns out to be a grisly place where vampires feed on the visiting truckers. Upon arrival, we are served with an orgy of gore, vampires and true outrageous b-movie horror!.As for the performances of the cast, Clooney's performance was top notch and he captured his character perfectly. As for Tarantino, he was nominated for a razzie for it!. While it wasn't the greatest acting I've ever seen, it was fine! and you have to remember that hes a director not an actor!. Keital was great as always. Juliette Lewis (who was earlier in Tarantino's natural born killers) plays a very different character to the deranged one she played in NBK, shes an innocent girl that has unfairly suffered the loss of her whole family.Some people prefer the first part to the second part and vice-versa. But personally, i enjoyed the whole film and although it wasn't a masterpiece or anywhere near as good as Tarantino's other work, I give it a 6 simply because of how much i enjoyed it.This is sheer entertainment but be aware, you may not get the b-movie style and hate it! But still its worth a watch! 6/10",6,1,2,29 March 2008
Paranormal Activity," Paranormal Activity is a relatively original, raw, frighteningly realistic portrayal of a cinematic haunting.
","Paranormal Activity follows a young couple, as they become tormented by an evil spirit. The instant allure of this film is, of course, the 'super original' pseudo-documentary format otherwise famed in 'The Blair With Project' (1999) and 'Cloverfield' (2008). While I can agree that this approach to horror is a nice break from the usual gore-fests we're terrorised by in modern horror, 'Paranormal Activity' still feels ragged and radically uninspired. 'Cloverfield' offered a stagnantly boring yet realistic point of view in the event of a monster attacking New York (which we know is a tired scenario). 'Paranormal Activity' is doing the same, getting a concept as old as death itself and filming it with a crappy camera. That's OK with me; I admire the film's moments of frightening intensity and tense entrapment yet for most of the 86 minute running time, I was left bored by the predictable story and shallow script.The desperate state of modern horror doesn't translate financially; 'Paranormal Activity' cost a measly $15,000 to produce while it enjoys profits exceeding $100,000,000 since release. This astonishing financial success is backed up by an ample plethora of positive critical acclaim, yet that doesn't leave me convinced. Nor could I ever imagine that this would really be a horror of true quality measuring up to the classics. So in that respect, the film met my expectation.The quality of the film was largely two-fold. On one end, there's the psychological ferociousness and suspense of the night scenes yet on the other end, we got a bold disparity of archetypal characters and lame script-writing. The man of the couple, Micah (Micah Sloat), is more of a terrifying microcosm of Christian Bale, Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise than a striking male protagonist. His goofy, alpha-male persona was an annoying distraction – even more so than his wife, Katie (Katie Featherston), who's plainer than Leona Lewis in a coma. The script was disappointing, unoriginal drivel, increasing the film's pivotal reliance on the somewhat dynamic format most obviously displayed in the night scenes. These moments had a great atmospheric nature; creating unbearable tension, entrapping the audience in a state of suspended inescapability. These snippets impressed me, showcasing a multitude of psychological horror that the genre has been starved of in recent years. As you can probably notice from my contrasting words, the quality of 'Paranormal Activity' is about as temperamental as a bipolar woman on her period.While the pseudo-documentary format pioneers the moments of heightened terror, it simultaneously shoves the film down the road of mediocrity. Such a style demands short running times, which left the film feeling bare and undeveloped whilst the solitary camera use felt restricting at times, almost leaving too much emphasis on what we don't see rather than what we do. Of course, this restriction creates the suspense, but I felt there were missed opportunities for more climactic shocks that doesn't really come until the very end. I was left wanting more at the conclusion of the film, the immense night scenes wetted my appetite but I wasn't given the opportunity to take a bite. The film teases you with an intriguing point of view and dangles various semi-scares for the audience yet it doesn't deliver beyond that. That is where this horror slumps.The independent, perhaps revolutionary transcendence of 'Paranormal Activity' is something to embrace – horror being a dying genre, I respect attempts to refresh it. But, this attempt is futile and lagging. Its junctures of great quality only frustrated me as it shot itself in the foot with lame casting and script-writing. I can't help but wonder how the $15,000 budget was spent...6/10",6,0,1,5 December 2009
The Dark Knight," Undoubtely the best superhero film ever made but lets not get ahead of ourselves here...
","Christopher Nolan first brought Batman back to life with 'Batman Begins' which I unfortunately didn't see because I thought it looked drab but 'The Dark Knight' had me at the edge of my seat and in utter awe at Ledger's sadistic rebirth of the prolific character we all admire - The Joker Ledger's Joker has rapidly become a hugely iconic character and grown a massive cult behind it. After seeing the film I can admit that I have fallen in love with the latest Joker. Throughout the film i was waiting impatiently for him to come back on screen. He was a delight to watch, from the freakish tone of voice to the innovative new make up scheme. Furthermore, I think we can agree that Jack Nicholson has finally been overshadowed from his 1989 stint as the Joker. Its a huge shame that Ledger passed before he could see his character immerse movie-goers around the world. He will no doubt receive one of few posthumous Oscar nominations, whether he'll win is something we'll have to wait because it may be a close one with such other great films coming out at the end of the year.Not only was the Joker a great villain i also enjoyed Eckhart's reinvention of Two-Face. Whilst I felt that Tommy Lee Jones' creation was more entertaining, Eckhart's was intriguing with extended back story and of course excelled make-up to make him look grotesque. I also would have liked a bit more of Two-Face but the Joker was enough to compensate.Bale was also competent as Batman. He managed to achieve the cool and slick Bruce Wayne we remember but I felt his ridiculous voice of his Batman alias was very off putting. Fair enough its to conceal his identity and I suppose it make its more feasible but in the more serious scenes I was holding back the laughter because of his insanely deep voice.Anyway, the film should expect many technical Oscar nominations alongside Ironman and who knows if the ret of the films in the year are mediocre a best picture nomination?.Concluding, Nolan has resurrected Batman with ruthless effectiveness and the complex story with the irresistible performance by Ledger has made The Dark Knight a searing success.The Dark Knight is a fantastic comic book adaptation yet i feel that the public are severely over-rating it and taking it as a serious thriller. The Dark Knight must be considered a superhero film and nothing more. I feel that people are looking at Ledger's Joker rather than the film as a whole. Of course Ledger's performance is a 10 but the film is an 8. The plots not great, the script is great at places but not ground-breaking. Therefore its not a GREAT film but a GREAT SUPERHERO film. The idea that this is anywhere near the greatness of godfather and shawshank redemption or most of the films in the top 100 is absurd. Public - stop looking at just the joker and look at the film before you rate it. 8/10",7,5,11,4 August 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Fascinating, Mind Blowing, Exceptional, Unprecedented, Quirky Masterpiece of Cinema..One of the most important films of all time
","After recently watching this for the second time, my opinion of it has wildly changed. My first impression was mediocrity and that it was just a random orchestration of wild images. Yet after watching it again with closer convictions, I've epiphanised that not only is this much higher than mediocrity, this is one of the most influential and important films ever made.The Film starts with the dawn of man in which a group of primates are shown surviving in the wilderness of early earth. Then the monolith mystically appears, this enigma causes awe by the primates. This sense of extraordinary awe is increased by Kubricks exceptional choice of music. Shortly after, the first act of weaponry is discovered through a primate picking up a bone and using it violently...this is the birth of human intelligence.Then the story of astronaut Bowman is ensued which involves the iconic figure of HAL. I would try to expand on the story line but it's simply a film you need to watch yourself.These monoliths that appeared in the dawn of man appear three times throughout the film, Kubrick stated that these monoliths symbolise a method of alien intelligence observing the development of human kind, yet it should be stressed that interpretation is PURELY subjective.This is a very visual film hence why it won the 1968 Oscar for visual effects. The effects are simply awe-inspiring and dazzling. The first 25 minutes of the film have no dialogue and the last 23 minutes also have no dialogue. With the beginning and end included, there is 88 minutes of non-dialogue in the whole film!. Is this lack of dialogue a thing to be criticised with?. No, these beautiful scenes of melded imagery and sound make this a groundbreaking accomplishment of epic proportions.Why is this considered as one of the greatest films of all time?. Well its an original insight into the existence of earth and also about the life outside of earth. This film will make you wonder and think, it throws more questions at you than answers much like the reason for our existence. This is one of the greatest Sci-Fi film ever made (yes as good if not better than star wars) and i believe this is one of Kubrick's very best cinematic achievements.Bravo Kubrick! 10/10",10,2,7,24 April 2008
Saw," Finally a good modern horror film!
","'Congratulations. You are still alive. Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore. 'Alas a modern horror movie with plot!This is a brutal and barbaric film about a doctor and a photographer (a sleazy one) that get chained up either side of an abandoned bathroom and are fed vicious mind games from the deranged Jigsaw.Not only is there a fair amount of prominent horror in this movie, there is a decent and gripping plot which links very cleverly near the end.The imagery of Jigsaws puppet makes the film ooze of mysteriousness and also adds to the horror (to all clown haters out there!) I was starting to get worried that the genre of horror had ran out of originality with garbage like Hostel and Grudge but this is a refreshing piece of Horror and a start of a wonderful horror series In conclusion, This is a brutally enjoyable horror film and is my personal favourite in the horror genre. Bring on more Saw! 7/10",7,0,2,25 October 2007
A Clockwork Orange," Memorable, Mesmerising and Magnificent Masterpiece
","A Clockwork Orange is a story of a young degenerate called Alex de Large who seems as if he is a normal teenager living with his parents. But as you scratch the surface you see that he's a cold hearted evil criminal. After he gets betrayed by his gang and sent to jail for murder he is chosen to try out the governments new reformation program which has interesting results.The reformation technique is called the 'Ludivico Technique' in which the prisoner is pinned down and forced to watch films of graphic crimes such as rape, murder etc. The idea of it is to give so much violence to the prisoner that he begins to dislike it and grow a natural resistance to it. This natural resistance is a sick sensation felt any time the thought of violence comes to the prisoners mind. Although this stops the prisoner committing crime, it raises ethical issues that are stressed by the prison vicar such as the fact that Alex isn't truly good, he only performs because of the fear of being in physical pain. A quote that interested me in the film is 'A man who cannot choose ceases to be a man'. Alex cant choose whether to do good or bad because hes a robot forced to do good. This in itself is called a clockwork orange. There was much confusion of the name 'A clockwork orange' and what it means. In the book, F.Alexander is writing a book called a clockwork orange which Alex notices prior to the brutal rape of his wife (otherwise known as the 'singin in the rain' scene) he then rips its up. However this isn't in the film. The actual definition of a clockwork orange is someone that can only perform good or evil. This is in direct correspondence with Alex's story in the book and film.Alex and his droogs (Dim, Pete and Georgie) use a very enigmatic and somewhat Shakespearian lexis such as 'chelloveck' and a personal favourite quote of mine 'how art thou glob of cheap stinking chip oil'. This is the slang of teenagers in the time of the film which is in the not so distant future. This is a fantastic prediction and also assumption of how youth will change. Many people find the dialect used by teenagers in the present day very hard to understand like we do to the language used by Alex and his droogs. No-one else seems to use that language other than Alex and his droogs, its teenage talk. Its like another realm of todays world. Also the fashion is a fantastic prediction of the not so distant future. The outfit and hairstyles in the film seem ridiculous to us as we watch it such as Alex's mum's crazy hair!. Much like today, we look back at 80's and 70's fashion and we see it as ridiculous. This all adds up to the conclusion that everything in this film is plausible even the crazy design of the Korova milk bar. The movie is in three parts, Alex and his droogs, Alex in jail and the treatment then Alex out of JailAlex de Large rapes, steals and kills people but he listens to and is driven by Classical music such as Mozart and Beethoven. Music is a very important device in this film. Part 1 of the film is series of music and violence orchestrated together with perfect harmony. Kubrick manages to take relaxing classical music and use it to make the scenes deranged and frantic. Not only that, the film also manages to give the music sadistic outlooks for the audience. For example, i now see the 9th symphony and Singin in the rain as evil songs now however, i enjoy listening to them more!. The film conditions us to like or hate the music more much like Alex is inavertely conditioned to resist beethoven in the Ludivico technique later in the film.Near the end of the film, Alex's demons come back to haunt him. Firstly, the old man he and his droogs assault in the beginning of the film spots him and realises who he is so he and his other homeless friends attack Alex savagely and take his belongings. Of course, Alex cant fight back because the pain of being punched is better than the sickly pain he gets if he performed any violence. The fight is then broken up by two police officers.....which Alex realises in horror are his two former droogs that betrayed him, Dim and Georgie. This is an ironic twist in the tale that the ones who are doing bad have switched sides. Alex is then near killed by his two former droogs. This is of course afer Alex had been rejected from home by another lodger staying there. He had no home, money or prospect so he ends at F.Alexanders house...Yes the man who Alex and his droogs assaulted earlier in the film. The writer doesn't recognise Alex at first but he knew he was on thin ice. F.Alexander wanted to use Alex for political value against the government because he is against the use of the Ludivico technique and the government. However, all changes when the old writer finds out who Alex really was when he hears him singing the same jingle he was singing when raping his wife, Im Singin in the rain. Kubrick manages to make the audience feel sorry for Alex. We feel sorry for a prisoner of rape and murder. Alex is clearly an evil soul yet we seem to have a relationship with him through the film which makes us like him and empathise with him. This makes this film a beautifully cunning film. I love the music, I love the iconic direction and I love the language!10/10",10,1,3,13 August 2007
The Fly," One of the most understated cinematic tragedies. The Fly is a poignant yet compactly terrifying sci-fi experience
","David Cronenberg's 'The Fly' follows a young scientist's ambitious dreams of inventing something world-changing shatter due to something as mind-numbingly trivial as a fly. Seth Brundle looked set for a prosperous life with a happy relationship yet the intervention of bad luck put his life at a stand-still, turning him into an inhuman freak, isolated from society and the life that he once lived. Sensibly directed by Cronenberg, the film presents a simple story that I believe to be one of the most understated cinematic tragedies. Jeff Goldblum stars as Seth Brundle; a great performance from one of Hollywood's under-appreciated actors. The effects were excellent for its time, presenting Brundle's descent in frightening and shocking detail. 'The Fly' documents a freak occurrence, a shockingly dramatic spectacle fuelled by one man's nonpareil ambition. Tragic how it was tarnished by one of earth's most insignificant creatures. 8.5/10",8,0,1,28 June 2009
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's hip, cool, naturalistic, incomparable gangster masterpiece
","Reservoir Dogs: Tarantino's debut of writing and directing.Reservoir Dogs is a fitting and satisfying beginning to the series of Tarantino's excellently unique film archive. This film entails the story of a gangs heist of a jewelery shop that goes terribly wrong. They think there's a rat in the gang and things get pretty violent!.To protect the gangs identities, they only each other by colour. There's Mr Pink (Steven Buscemi), Mr White (Harvey Keitel), Mr Brown (Tarantino), Mr Blue (Eddie Bunker), Mr Blonde (Michael Madsen) and Mr Orange (Tim Roth). This mysterious and unparaleled alias inclusion is a cool feature that I am sure none of us have ever seen in a gangster film.Despite the films low budget, the cast was very good with such faces as Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth. Keitel even helped produce the film. This just proves how gripping Tarantino's writing is to be able to rake in the top stars for a low budget. Tarantino also managed this in Pulp Fiction.Keitel pulled off a blistering performance as the sombre and somewhat pseudo-professional Mr White. Steve Buscemi's performance was also spot on, his depiction of the allegedly gay Mr Pink brought the film to a deliciously ironic end. Michael Madsen was also exceptional as the psychopath murderer Mr Blonde.The film opens with one of the most famous scenes of the 90's, the classic scene of the gang sitting in a coffee shop. Its a scene of constant pop references, irresistible Tarantino dialogue and dark humour. This bona fida scene shaped the beginning of Tarantino's career and provides something none of us have ever seen before.Tarantino's retro 70/80's choice of music is very cool. Especially, the music in the famous ear cutting scene. 'Stuck in the Middle with you' by Stealers Wheel was a perfect on-screen juxtaposition that reaches into the viewer and rips out any sense of calmness.This is the start of a legacy of stylish cinema from one of the hottest directors in Hollywood. However, this doesn't live up to Tarantino's later work 8.3/10",9,0,1,24 February 2007
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," It haunts, It disgusts, It disturbs, but does it mean anything?
","Salo follows a group of fascist libertines rounding up a group of good-looking boys and girls to put through sexual, mental and physical torture. As a fan of daring films, I felt it extremely necessary to see such a film being a fan of A Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut. Salo pushes the boundaries of shock and disturbia and makes any other 'violent' and 'explicit' films seems like excerpts of Barney the dinosaur. The explicitness is constant and increasingly worse as the film progresses.Surprisingly, the film made me feel queasy. However, interpreting this film is impossibly hard. On one hand, you could see it as a pointless orgy of cordless sexuality or you could see it as a representation of how power corrupts the human mind. As far as I'm concerned, I could have given this film a 1 or a 10, yet the film is so unique it is almost impossible to decipher an accurate rating. So by default, I gave it a middle rating of 5.Yet, Salo is a film all film fans should see. Its bold, daring and beautifully directed. Very interesting but impossible to interpret.5/10",5,0,2,12 April 2009
Pulp Fiction," A Paragon Picture...
","Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' continues to inspire, shock and intrigue an entire audience of film watchers since its release in 1994. The story consists of three sagas of drugs, deceit and sleaze inter-linking in a vastly unconventional and unchronological style leading to a simply astonishing end sequence. Tarantino builds a strong plethora of almost archetypal characters that resembles pulp material. The scenarios are almost generic situations that we always see, yet Tarantino and Avary add another zest to these stories that lead on a tangent resulting in a complex inter-mingling of transition and unbelievable acts of fate.Interpreting this movie is almost impossible; it's become the subject of many film studies courses. Responses to the mysterious contents of the briefcase is a hotly fought debate. Some say it's the soul of Marsellus, others the jewels from Reservoir Dogs or others simply say it's a golden light bulb! Tarantino has made the film stick with you, caused debate amongst its fan and accomplished a medium of mysteriousness towards the film that somewhat mirrors the incomprehensible nature of 2001: A Space Odyssey.An overall interpretation of this film is equally impossible. It is often called a 'masterpiece with no message', this is true but a fan can at least delve deeper into the subject matter of this film, what's happening? and what really binds this set of sleazy characters. Tarantino's script tends to look at the importance of transition and the repercussions of not acknowledging this transition. Butch and Marsellus' experience with Zed leads to an immense change in their relationship, their blind hate leads to a mutual sense of acceptance that Butch takes into account and leaves town as soon as he can. Then you have Jules' 'moment of clarity'. His divine experience makes him change his ways and acknowledge a sign of transition away from gangster activities. Interestingly, Vincent's disregardance of this 'divine intervention' leads to a cruel fate of death. Then finally, you have Yolandi and Ringo's frightening thought that they would lose each other therefore seem as if to alter their villainous ways. Their transition is captured by Jules' final speech speaking of his desire to be the shepard and guide them through a tyranny of evil (which he ultimately does!). In a way, 'Pulp Fiction' tracks a range of characters going through a huge change governed by the perplexing actions of fate or even of a form of divinity.One thing that is extraordinary about Tarantino's script is its flawless ability to enthral and entertain. The speech is memorable and expertly crafted, the banter is thought-provoking and lifts these characters from their almost archetypal interpretations.Jules: Let's get into character The script is almost a critical expose of what goes on behind the scenes of these typical gangster situations that we've seen so many times. That is why the script is so dynamic. Never have I comprehended a screenplay where almost every scene has quotable lines and I probably never will again! The film was garnished with 7 Oscar nominations and 1 win (for the screenplay). Perhaps Pulp Fiction should have snatched best picture and some acting Oscars yet the important thing is, the film didn't need the awards and Tarantino didn't want it! He just made a movie he wanted to make and like so many other films shunned by the Academy, it has become as memorable if not more memorable as the film that won best picture (Forrest Gump) PulpFiction is a cinematic marvel, a tour-de-force of magnificent proportions. Beautifully directed by Tarantino and the awesome performances of Uma Thurman, Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta elevate the film to a cult pedestal that is almost unrivalled. Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece may be one of the greatest films of all time.10/10",10,0,2,18 February 2007
There Will Be Blood," Remarkably Unique, Astonishing, Quirky, Eccentric, Brilliant, this may be one of the greatest films of all time
","'I drink your milkshake!'After going to see this film i left the cinema thinking to myself: 'I may have just witnessed one of the greatest movies of all time' Its a story of an oil tycoon called Daniel Plainview (played by daniel day lewis) who accompanied by his son, takes over a small village in the desire of oil and money. There are many side tracks for Daniel on his way to success and this constructs a marvellous and emphatic film.The beginning is a 15 minute sequence which involves no dialogue. Its extraordinary how a 15 minute clip with no dialogue could keep me so gripped to the film. Its an illustration of how Daniel strikes oil for the first time in the method of mining for silver. The mesmerising opening sequence is similar to the beginning of 2001: a space odyssey in which the discovery of human kind takes place. The beginning of 2001 is epic, extraordinary and fascinating much like this opening. This opening is about the beginning of a business filled with greed.People say that money is the root of all evil. The lust of money drove Daniel to lose everything he loved. At the beginning, he says that he loves everything. But as the film goes on and as his oil business increases Daniel turns from an omnibenevolent person to an omnimalevolent person. This deterioration of character to Daniel is all because of the greed and lust he grew through his business. Oil is the root to all evil in this film.Daniel buys the lease of the village which the oil contains from Eli (part of the family that live there) in a transaction that seems fair and reasonable. But later, Daniel's true greedy side is shown when he rips off Eli. Eli asks Daniel for his money and instead of handing the money over, Daniel hands him over a few slaps and a rub in the mud!. Whether this is out of anger because of Daniel's child becoming deaf or Daniel showing his true colours, its a fantastic scene.One thing i noticed while watching the film is the fact that many themes in it resemble Kubrickian style. 2001 was a Kubrick film as mentioned earlier and the theme of discovery is explored in there will be blood much like 2001. Furthermore, the superb musical score of the film is very similar to Kubricks 'The Shining'. The music is cold, hard and gritty. At one point i believed that the opening musical score was taken directly from The Shining but this was under debate in between my friends!. The overall music score of the film involves very classical style music which is the music Kubrick used in all his films. The ending i pondered was resemblant of Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' in which it ends with one cool line ('Im finished') and is rounded off with a long classical score. Kubricks 'Eyes wide shut' ends similarly to this in which it ends with the one line 'Lets f**k'.The ending is very crisp. Daniel loses his son and his business. At this point, Daniel is completely changed and is only a business maniac. The news of his son wanting to start his own business spurs on the idea that his son is a competitor and shouldn't be loved. Although the loss of his business is shown clearly, it is insinuated with the finished line 'Im finished!'. This is after he kills Eli. Daniel has lost his mind out of greed. The significance of the last line is perplexing. This could suggest his life is finished due to his inevitable trip to jail for murder or it could symbolise the ending of all family relationships due to Eli being his son in law. It is whatever you want to perceive it as.This is a suspenseful and chilling masterpiece with breath taking performances and cinematography. My review is very linear, it would be best for you to go and see it! 10/10",10,2,7,8 February 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Stunning yet Disturbing Film
","'I must be crazy to be in a loony bin like this.' This is definitely one of Nicholson's best performances and perhaps one of the greatest performances of all time. Its powerful and compelling message along with the entertaining and engaging characters makes its almost a perfect movie. Its a shocking account of life in a mental asylum with the bitch-face nurse who has just about as much emotion as a robot (im sure everyone can agree with me). Although I thought the ending could of been slightly better i would still acclaim this as one of the best films made. Its not for the faint hearted because of its demented theme. I give it a 9/10, a big achievement in cinema.",9,0,2,7 September 2007
The Reader," 'The Reader' is powerfully executed and stunningly acted yet the lack of a vivid message unquestionably brings down the film
","'The Reader' is a sentimental and heavy journey through the complex relationship between a young man (Michael) and an ex holocaust guard (Hannah). Their relationship begins to consist of odd sexual pleasure to pleasure deriving from the sharing of literature or rather the reading of it. As the film progresses, the two slowly drift apart yet their universal love for literature and furthermore, Hannah's illiterate yearn to be read too supports their rather ominous relationship. Hannah is condemned for life imprisonment due to her actions in Auschwichz, while Michael continues to develop his law career until 20 years later when an astonishing sequence of actions lead to a poignant conclusion.Kate Winslet's performance was truly praise-worthy, also her leniency in getting undressed and showing a bit of flesh was admirable. Some of her scenes shared with Michael (Ralph Fiennes) were very erotic, yet not in a tasteless way, Daldry shot it in a way to present love and compassion. The erotica wasn't used for the sake of producing just a reaction, not at all.While this film was powerfully performed, almost masterfully directed and daring on the eye, the film's quality was dragged down by its definite failure to provide a vivid message or any redeeming value. I left the film disillusioned and extremely usure of what I had just seen or what the director has wanted me to see. Not in a good way like 2001:A Space Odyssey but in rather, an annoyingly confused way. I was watching the film yearning for a poignant meaning to this well-presented story, I was waiting for a moment of reflection, questioning or rather simply some type of way to stick all these actions in the film together. Yet instead I left the film mentally frustrated. I do love a film that involves thought, but I feel this film either doesn't have the capacity or has too much capacity for me to enjoy thinking about or to even decipher the meaning of it.Daldry's 'The Reader' is a film of huge quality, but the lack of any wider contextual edge truly lowers my opinion of it.Oscar wise, best picture? Definitely not, best actress for Kate Winslet? Maybe.7.5/10",7,2,3,22 January 2009
WALL·E," Astonishing Animation, Beautiful, Cute with an unusually powerful message
","Wall·E is an animation with a distinct difference. Not only does it contain somewhat slapstick kiddy jokes to obviously appeal to children, it has a deep, dark message that will automatically stand out to all adults alike. Wall·E has been described as 2001:A Space Odyssey for all audiences, I agree. They share many similarities such as the lack of dialogue and the breath taking visuals. Furthermore, the story near the end is resembles the man vs machine storyline that was present in 2001: A Space Odyssey with the HAL situation. Not only that, the AUTO looks EXACTLY like HAL. Pixar wanted to pull off a Kubrick inspired animated masterpiece and they have. Its obvious with their use of Kubrickian classical music and the cold robotic voices for the robots.Anyway, heres the story briefly as in to not ruin it for you. Wall·E is a waste disposal unit who is programmed to clear garbage. He lives on the dystopian earth where mankind is inept due to the heaving amount of rubbish. Wall·E is the only one of his kind and therefore lives a lonely life of waste disposal. Until EVE comes along and builds an ironically romantic relationship with Wall·E. He follows EVE to a strange giant space ship that seems to harbour a new world. Wall·E then finds himself wrapped into a race which could save Mankind.I mention in the title that this film has a powerful message. I think that I can on behalf of many people that this film really is an eye opener. Its a realistic symbol of capitalism gone wrong, Technology gone wrong and finally waste disposal gone wrong. These commercial problems relate perfectly to current world events and Pixar has released this film at a perfect time. Pixar satirise all of these problems. In this odd world, you can buy lunches in a bottle, advertisements are plastered everywhere you can see, robots help every little movement you want to do and of course the inhabitants are disgracefully obese. People are lazy, stupid and unpleasant. The appearance is glossy and shiny yet cold and distant. This city of Pixaristic satire is a grim image indeed. Is this simply a whining attempt of protest from Pixar? No. This is feasible and people should see it as a reality check. Obesity is rising, Technology is becoming increasingly ridiculous and commercialism is ever rising. Ridley Scott's Bladerunner presents a similar commercial future yet Scott's representation is much darker which Pixar simply couldn't implement for a supposed kids movie!.As for Wall·E and EVE's relationship, they are both extremely cute and they're relationship was heart warming and beautiful. Its also somewhat ironic that they built a relationship. Wall·E is a clumsy and rusty looking machine yet EVE is a graceful and beautiful robot. But they have one thing in common, they are both alone. I feel that Pixar reveal another message here, that appearance isn't everything. Not the most predominant message but i saw it.As for the sound, the music used was rhythmic and surprising serious at some times. For example, the opening begins with a rather serious deep tune as the piles of trash on earth is revealed. This is a realisation that this is no kiddys film this is a serious animation beholding serious messages we need to consider. This is what made this so powerful for me. Kids will be watching this but deep down this is not a kids film. Furthermore, the score is consistently exceptional throughout the film and I would some sort of sound based Oscar nomination for Pixar.The animation was absolutely breath-taking. Pixar have wowed us every year ever since the animated triumph of Toy Story. Last year i was astonished by Ratatouille's animation but Wall·E is a step up. The animation is truly unbelievable, a triumphant achievement of technology.Pixar have pulled off a masterpiece, a unique conqueration of animation. This must be considered as a serious sci-fi film because it simply is. Only the greatest sci-fi's are as powerful as Wall·E. Pixar should expect many Oscar nominations, Best Animation, Best Cinematography, Best Sound and maybe even Best Picture. Who Knows? Its deserves it Praise for Pixar as they have pulled it off again with their most powerful yet comical sci-fi adventure film.Well what can i say? Its the best animation I have ever seen so go see it! 9.5/10",9,4,7,18 July 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," Demme's masterpiece is gripping, psychotic, thought provoking and perfectly performed
","'A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti' What more could encapsulate the psychotic nature of this charged thriller? Silence of the Lambs follows Clarice Starling's FBI investigation into a string of sadistic murders by a killer known as 'Buffalo Bill'. A break-through in the case can only be found through the interrogation of the brilliant yet outlandishly insane confined psychologist, Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter. Hannibal will only provide the information in exchange for Clarice to tell him about her own personal life which acts as the fantastic foundation for the title of this lucrative masterpiece.The story was structured and shot perfectly. The film was constantly charged with suspense and tension, littered with thought-provoking dialogue oozing with intrigue. The performances were just awe-inspiring as the academy acknowledge. Anthony Hopkins was simply chilling as the twisted, genius that is Hannibal Lecter. Chills also arise through Ted Levine's frightening invention of the character of Buffalo Bill. Levine should have notched up a nomination for a best supporting actor at the Oscars due to the performance's flawless ability to chill and disturb. Also, Foster can not be forgotten as she played the multi-faceted character of Clarice Starling. Foster conjures an awesome balance of emotion to flawlessly invent the character of Clarice.Overall, Silence of the Lambs is engaging, disturbing, chilling and holds it's ground as one of the greatest thrillers of all time.",9,1,2,9 March 2009
Blade Runner," Simply Exceptional, this thought provoking sci-fi showpiece will stay in my mind a very long time
","Bladerunner (1982) - Top 10 Sci Fi's of All Time Bladerunner is one of the most unique experiences i have ever embarked on. Ridley Scott's dystopian view of the future of LA is haunting and visually beautiful. The ruthless, capitalist world is frighteningly feasible. The grim future our world has is brought to reality in this original masterwork by a fantastic director.The story entails that humans built artificial robot like creatures called replicants which are full blown clones of humans!. The catch is though that they can only live for four years. These replicants have about as much intelligence as their creators. These replicants become out of control and in turn forbidden from earth and forced to work as slaves. To make sure that these replicants stay off earth, Blade Runners are hired. This enchanting story really reveals how the world is leading to self destruction and we are really getting too intelligent for our own good!. Playing God will never work.Harrison Ford plays a Bladerunner who has to eliminate four replicants that hijacked a space ship and got back to earth. His performance was brilliant, as we would expect from Ford. During his journey he meets a female who doesn't seem to know shes a replicant, this develops into a rather confusing romance story. A replicant and a human in love?Throughout the film there are bizarre melds of chilling music. Piercing cat howlings are used throughout the film especially in the final showdown between Deckard (Ford) and Roy. This showdown is one of the most intriguing showdowns in cinema. Why is Deckard so scared of Roy?, why do they relate to each other so much? This is a relatively brief film and while I would have preferred it to be longer, it did leave me somewhat awe-strucked by the cliffhanger ending. Im a great fan of films that provide more questions than answers after all, a film that makes you think is better than any other film.Perhaps Deckard is a replicant himself? Ill be thinking about this possibility for days and maybe weeks to come. This entertaining masterpiece is a soaring achievement and Ridley Scott should be praised8.9/10",9,0,0,5 June 2008
Amélie," Amelie is Le Magnifique!
","French cinema has never stuck out to me to produce very good films but this magnificently executed fantasy is a pure delight to watch, the unorthodox direction is both influential and a relieving breath of fresh air in cinema! Fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain follows the story of young and niave Amelie. She lives a rather uneventful life but once she stumbles across a mysterious tin of childhood treasure, she is devoted to giving it back to the owner, who was a child when he planted it in her apartment over 50 years back. This rush of goodness gives Amelie the desired mission to help all of mankind but whilst helping others she comes across some love for herself.Amelie's character oozes of originality and she is exceptionally lovable, to me anyway!. Amelie is quiet, reserved yet intelligent. She enjoys the smaller things in life like skipping stones and looking back at peoples faces in the cinema!. Amelie acts as a role model for shy females, she shows that despite having a conservative personality, you can still find love and furthermore, the themes of running after something rather than waiting for it to run after you can in itself act as a powerfully inspirational message to many women, even men. Amelie is a heart warming bona fide character that truly lightens the film throughout. Bravo Audrey Tatou! The film manages to cover many emotions, laughter, happiness, sadness, pity and more. This roller-coaster of emotions is a big achievement for me in the film. There are fantastic moments of great humour yet there are tear jerking segments. The balance is close to perfect, in fact it is perfect! Not only is this film a relatively easy to watch film, the story is quite complex in its own way. There are many things going on, and small sub-stories that go on that somehow link to a bigger story etc. All just a meld of stories that link together in a very smooth way.Does this deserve its high place on the top 250? - Yes This is the definitive feel good movie in which the director explores and experiments in many unorthodox ways. This is one for everyone! 8/10",8,1,5,10 July 2008
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Monty Python is not a movie, its a mish mash of unfunny, ridiculous pseudo-comedy that seems as though its constructed by a 3 month old baby
","I was eager to see this film after it having such a good reputation but its a film with no story, constant unfunny stupidity and general crapiness.People say its typical British humour, well in that case i don't like British humour. Im sure if you find it funny, its an hilarious film. But im rating this as a movie like i would for any other and therefore it deserves a 1/10, nothing higherAn 8.5 rating should be on a film which is actually a good MOVIE not a good sketch show (that for the record didn't make me laugh). It makes me feel sick that this trash has higher ratings than full metal jacket, platoon and reservoir dogs. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion Mine is just the right one :)Monty Python is not an excuse in silly comedy; it is simply a failure, it sends jokes at you every second yet it fails to deliver.",1,15,57,13 August 2007
Sin City," Unique Style but Average Story
","'I love hit men. No matter what you do to them, you don't feel bad. 'When i first saw this film being advertised, it intrigued me because of the comic book and unique style it holds. A thing that intrigued me more was the fact that Rodriguez and Tarantino were working together on it (although Tarantino only directed small part of film) , of course they make a good pair making 'From Dusk Till Dawn' and 'Desperado'.As for the film itself, I was surprised to see another pulp fiction style structured film in the context of, there being 3 stories that initially intertwine as the film progresses. Although it had the same rough and sleazy feel to the film it failed to deliver something that pulp fiction did, the breaking of gangster stereotypes. Pulp Fiction did this through casual every day conversation and pop culture reference. This is also used effectively in Reservoir Dogs. This fact somehow brings the film down to average status.The three stories have somewhat simple but effective plots that makes it easy to follow. Unlike pulp fiction, it didn't have on screen chapter names, some people believe that to be an advantage however, i believe the use of chapter titles makes it easier to take in but the use of a black screen for a few seconds isn't all that bad.The stories don't intertwine as cleverly as the 3 in pulp fiction do and this i think affects the message and style of the film. The outrageous and graphic violence in this movie are quite overdone and seems as if they were put in to just be controversial and shock the audience rather then show real life, possible situations. I am talking about the movie without thinking about the comic so I'm not suggesting that the director should have lowered it down, i am just looking at this as a movie rather then an adaptation of a comic book.In conclusion, i see this as an entertaining film but movie fanatics, don't prepare to be impressed by the lacklustre stories 5/10",5,0,2,12 August 2007
True Romance," A quick, blistering, relentless and enjoyable piece of cinema
","'They got everything here from a diddled-eyed Joe to damned if I know. ' This in my opinion is one of the greatest romantic comedy films ever made. Well i don't even now if i can call it a romantic comedy. Its filled with violence, sex , drugs and of course sneaky Tarantino-esquire dark comedy. In my opinion, its an adult romantic comedy because of the obvious story of love.Its a story of a young couple who accidentally get a suitcase of cocaine which they then attempt to sell but it has many obstacles.It is one of tarantinos most autobiographical films in the context of, Clarence is heavily into comic books, he works in a comic book shop which is similar to the video shop Tarantino worked at when he was younger, Clarence has a boss called Lance like Tarantino did and Clarence likes to go to the cinema every birthday like Tarantino did. As Clarence is presented as a cool and sharp guy perhaps when Tarantino was writing the script he saw Clarence as the cool person he wanted to be? Tony Scott did a brilliant job directing the film, although he changed the ending, he did a very good job. The star studded cast gives the film a very enjoyable and entertaining element. Of course the cameo of Samuel .l. Jackson will make everyone laugh.In conclusion, this is a film anyone would like and its slightly under-rated in my opinion. So when you watch sit back and enjoy.",8,0,1,5 September 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," Brutality, Corruption, Abhorrence, Drama and Romance intertwine in Boyle's magnificently directed glance into life in the slums of India
","Slumdog Millionaire examines the life of Jamal Malik whose troubled background ranges from struggling to live in a Mumbai slum as a child to narrowly escaping murdering organ sellers. The basis lies in Jamal's stint as a contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire. He is one day away receiving the question worth the grand prize of 20 million rupees, yet Jamal's slumdog background rouses suspicion about how he is really getting these questions correct. A violent interrogation ensues in which Jamal explains how it was so that he answered all the questions correctly. From this, the film switches back and forth to Jamal's past which links masterfully to the questions asked. The editing was stunning; the story slowly reveals that Jamal isn't cheating, he is just experiencing some amazing luck! Stupid it may seem but this abstract concept is an expression of fate and destiny; yet this isn't a simple rags to riches story we have seen before.Boyle examines the cold, brutal, corrupt life that is lived in the slums that I can't help but link to City of God. We slowly learn about the somewhat dysfunctional yet beautiful brotherly relationship between Jamal and Salim which leads to a poignant conclusion. Boyle uses a bona fide directing style, oozing with eccentricity, encapsulating the horror of the slums and utilising some truly memorable shots. The film was stunning on the eye, a magnum opus of directorial achievement.Not only was the brutality envisaged stunningly, the compassionate romance between Jamal and Latika was a great inclusion. Although the film could have held its own without it, it added some well-needed happiness to an otherwise grave and morbid mood the film has.The non-linearity and flamboyancy of this picture has won it a dream-like critical acclaim dominating award ceremonies across the cinematic world. At first I didn't agree yet after watching this inspirational film, I can see what the appeal is. The film was entertaining, it plays with your emotions, makes you cry with sadness and happiness. Slumdog Millionaire is truly sensational yet I don't see it being film of the year.The Oscars has given it an astonishing 10 nominations. I feel it deserves, best director, best editing, best sound editing and best cinematography. Gasp you may say by the fact that i don't think it deserves best picture. Well to be honest, best picture is going to be very close this year. Benjamin Button I can see being film of the year. But we shall see.As for Dev Patel, I'm not going to praise him highly for his performance despite it being faultless. His role wasn't a complex one yet he played it to the best that it could have been played. He doesn't deserve his BAFTA nomination and rightfully didn't get an Oscar nomination. Other powerhouse performances (Sean Penn, Mickey Rourke) this year easily overshadow his performance. Freida Pinto was fine as Latika and the actor portraying Salim was excellent. All in all, the cast didn't have one poor performance which is required in such a film. A lack of intensity could have destroyed this film.Slumdog Millionaire is poignant, shocking and ultimately astonishing. It explores the slums of Mumbai whilst building an inspirational story of fate, love and determination. Boyle has really pulled one out the bag this year.Oscars will be close this year.8.5/10",8,1,5,28 January 2009
The Social Network," Left a real Mark...
","Facebook. We all use it, most of us love it, so it was a matter of time before someone made a movie out of it. Hailed to be on par with the invention of the telephone, Mark Zuckerberg's gargantuan internet phenomena has infected the world with a brand-spanking new form of communication. 500 million people worldwide have found themselves lost in a realm of friend requests, statuses, tagging, news feeds and all sorts of innovative little tid-bits. Bit of fun right? Well, I think we can afford to be a bit more profound. Facebook isn't just an exercise in escapist entertainment, it's trivialised the process of communication in its entirety, figure-heading an explosive online movement fixed on harmonising global liaison. Who'd have thought that such an immense, world-changing concept could have come from one geek messing around in his little university dorm. It's a remarkable story that ached for an effective big screen adaptation. Was this ache throbbing in vain? Definitely not. But be aware folks, this isn't just a flat-out glorification of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg). Aaron Sorkin's witty script paints a genuine portrait of the cyber-magnate, revealing his stark flaws as he battles a potentially crippling law suit. Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg, in a role which grew to be more complex and multi-faceted than first thought. Being a relative newcomer and, in my opinion, emerging star, all eyes were on this young actor. Does he have the ability to hold such a biopic? Can he conjure the ultimate technological hero, or even anti hero? These were questions I had to ask beforehand, and God, did I feel stupid as I walked out. Eisenberg perfectly captures the essence of flawed genius, delivering Sorkin's portrayal of Zuckerberg with ruthless efficiency. Rather than shoving Zuckerberg's genius down our throats, the script leaves his likability wide open. On one end, he's obnoxious, irreverent, socially awkward and incredibly controlling. Whilst on the other, he's a misunderstood, brilliant aficionado, driven by mere passion, uninterested in monetary needs. Personally, I fell in love with Eisenberg's interpretation of Sorkin's script, he was mesmerisingly dry, punchy, and deeply absorbing. He's produced a character that will grow to become one of cinema's great flawed protagonists. In terms of plot, The Social Network pulls the Facebook creation story out by the roots and examines each twine with cracking detail. It drags us back to a time before the site's global explosion, a world where Zuckerberg is only known by his blogging alias, 'Zukonit' and his cyber creation is in the mere faetal stage, being classed as a 'book of faces' or 'The Facebook'. This was only 6 or 7 years ago but it seems millennia has gone by! This little fallacy symbolises the extraordinary rapidity of the spread of Facebook's infection across the world, making this picture eagerly fascinating. Every day, all of us are drawn to check our Facebooks, we meet new people and it's become a custom to ask if they're on Facebook, 'Don't worry, I'll Facebook you', 'You have that Facebook app?', 'Can't believe you just fraped me', are but just a few sentences drummed into the status quo. This site has become an impenetrable feature of our society and witnessing its fruition from the very beginning captivates beyond all recognition. So with Aaron Sorkin's sharp script and Jesse Eisenberg's impressive performance, all the film needed was some solid direction, of the likes David Fincher was happy to oblige. Fincher truly is a strong director, helming such pictures as Zodiac (2007), Fight Club (1999), Seven (1995) and, just recently, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). Like Ron Howard, he doesn't overstate with his work, he possesses the maturity and discipline to direct a film that allows the story and characters to develop freely as the screenplay initially intended. He's the liberal middle-man rendering a script through the camera in a smooth, majestic manner. As much as I'd hate to use the word 'standard' here, Fincher's camera-work is standard in method yet far beyond standard in quality, it fits the script like a glove. So, without further ado, let's knuckle down and discuss the Academy Awards. All of sudden we've drifted into awards season, the most exciting time of the cinematic year where the pains inflicted by the tripe blurted onto the summer screen are eased by a parade of fresh, top quality cinema. A new wave of technical scrutiny will hit viewers like a ton of bricks and The Social Network is one hell of an opener to this stimulating advent. To revert back to Eisenberg, he's sent ripples around cinema's critical forum, and rightfully so. He's pulled off a career-changing performance, emblematic of his blossoming into the great actor he'll very soon become. We'll expect to see him floating around the 'Best Leading Actor' category across the award ceremonies, but a win seems unlikely. As for Sorkin's expertly written script, it should expect top contention for 'Best Adapted Screenplay', and I can see a few supporting actors attracting recognition. The striking Achilles Heel for the film's promotion has been the inclusion of pop prince, Justin Timberlake in the cast. In the world of REAL cinema, his name falls under taboo. But, he's actually pretty bearable this time around, playing the super slick founder of 'Napster', Sean Parker. So try not to let that ghastly name impair your excitement! If you're worried that The Social Network is just a lousy pop carnation programmed to juice the money out of the Facebook loving public, you couldn't be more wrong. David Fincher's picture is a magnetic analysis of troubled genius, personified by an exceptional Eisenberg performance. What a dose of post-summer refreshment!",8,0,1,22 October 2010

The Birds," Mesmerising, Ingenious, Wildly original piece of melodramatic cinema
","'They're birds, aren't they?'.This film is truly a Ornithophobic's nightmare and is a film that makes you think of what menial power humans have in contrast to the potential power the animal kingdom can have over us.Its about a small harbour city that gets terrorised by all the birds that live there such as the Crows and Seagulls. The birds turn deranged and militant.The question is why do these birds turn on mankind? Hitchcock never stated a reason but it is widely believed that the birds turning against mankind is a symbol of how much us as humans live on the edge of the animal kingdom. Think about it, there are 100 billion birds on earth, if they turned against us, mankind would shrivel away.Its a frightening thought and the film presents this thought which leads to a chilling classic.There is no music in this film which although is original, i believe it tones down the tension of the film. However, the absence of digetic sound gives the audience a natural feel towards the film. Its a very down to earth and natural movie.In conclusion, this is a definitive hitchcock classic, note to the squeamish: avoid! 8/10",8,1,2,29 October 2007
