National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Not worth it! (May contain spoilers)
","I'm not going to go ahead and say that the movie sucked because it was a good movies, as action and acting are concerned but the plot was the most confusing and pointless I've ever seen in my life.*SPOILERS* I had no idea how the city of gold is supposed to help save the Gates' family name! Instead of trying to find the remaining five pages if they had possibly been removed from the fire; somehow, clues that send them across the world are supposed to save the Gates' from having a smeared history. Somehow, finding a lost city was supposed to save their family, when I just don't understand how they were connected in the first place.My friend honestly fell asleep next to me during this movie. I had a look of confusion on my face for the entire time the movie was running. I had no clue how all of this information was supposed to fit together. In the first movie, Ben, Riley, and Abigail give a lot of background information concerning the things they find. However, in this one, barely any information or background ideas are given, making all the history very hard to understand. *SPOILERS* I did enjoy the addition of Helen Mirren as Emily but Ed Harrison's character seemed so determined and then changed his mind by the end so he'd become the hero. It just didn't make much sense to me; if he's going to be the bad guy at the beginning, why not continue the streak and finish the movie as the antagonist?I would have preferred to stay at home, and watch NT1 instead of spending 10 bucks and wasting two hours of my life on this movie that I should have waited to come out on video.",5,2,5,23 December 2007
