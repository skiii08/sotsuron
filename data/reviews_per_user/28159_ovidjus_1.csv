Black Swan," A masterpiece - not for me! Ingredients: creepiness, creepiness, creepiness!
","I kept thinking whether I would rate this film with a 9 or an 8. I picked 9, for the best performance of an actress I have ever seen and for the Aronofsky specific directing skills. I will admit that this is probably the most intense movie I have ever seen.Nevertheless, I could have never rated this movie with a 10, because in my views it is not a work of art. Art should not create intense emotions of panic, depression... I believe I couldn't rate it with a 10 because it was actually a horror movie even if officially it is not a horror. But it is, and it is only depressing and spooky and it brings together all the creepiness you can find in this world of ours. Art should be encouraging, full of hope, should bring joy to the world, not creepiness, not fear, we can easily find these in the real world. Me, I prefer Roberto Benigni, whom I would love to watch over and over again.I would never watch Black Swan again, and if I would turn back the time, I wouldn't watch it for the first time. I would only want to see it again and rate it with a 10 if I were a fan of depression and panic attacks! As I already said, only for the huge, genius effort of Natalie Portman I rated it so high!",9,2,4,8 January 2013
