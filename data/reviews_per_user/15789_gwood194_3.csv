3:10 to Yuma," It just works...
","The western is an interesting genre. It can work either as plot driven or character driven. If we look at the 1957 version of 3:10 to Yuma, we can see an excellent example of a plot driven western - the characters are little more than stick figures moving around within the plot - Ben Wade and Dan Evans never really come to life. While the 2007 film retains and even expands the plot, it is the character development of these two that makes this movie great. Russell Crowe's Ben Wade is as complex a character as we're likely to find and Christian Bale's Dan Evans only slightly less so. Others have complained that it drags - and it is 30 minutes longer - but those parts that 'drag' are part of the character development. Of course, individually, we like what we like and those unable to follow what these two actors are doing should look elsewhere.Just a word about 'based on a short story by Elmore Leonard'. The Elmore Leonard story is about 15 pages and plants only a seed of plot for the movie. That this movie could arise from that seed is masterful writing. It reminds me of 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' which is based on a 39 page short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Again, Fitzgerald's story only plants a seed for what develops into a great story. (And Fitzgerald's short story isn't even one of his better efforts.) For me, movies fall into three categories - those I can't make it through the first time, those I can watch once and enjoy, and those that I can watch again and again, picking up something new each time. This is one of those in that last category.",10,2,4,21 July 2010
Interstellar," Less that the sum of its parts
","After all the hype I finally got a chance to see Interstellar. After its nearly three hours I had to sit in silence for a while as the emotion swept over me and I realized that I was...underwhelmed. The movie is stunning, lavish, and, after all, it deals with the ultimate salvation of mankind. But it left me feeling empty - like when you were a kid and you really, really, really wanted a bicycle for Christmas and you got up on Christmas morning to find, not a bicycle, but something else. Maybe the something else was just as good as (or maybe even better than) a bicycle - but wasn't a bicycle. I guess my point is that it was less than I expected. Maybe, after all the hype, NOTHING could have lived up to my expectations.But as I said - it was lavish, stunning, and a good story rather well told. What I have to ask myself is what my reaction might have been if I had gone into it cold - with no expectations. Maybe it had doomed itself to failure?",8,1,4,16 March 2015
Prometheus," Did I see the same movie?
","I read all the reviews panning this movie and I have to wonder if I saw the same movie as these folks. 'Prometheus' isn't a perfect movie but I found it entertaining. Is it scientifically accurate? Not in the universe I live in right now - we don't have space travel or any of the stuff that's integral to the plot. This is, after all, fiction and the thing about fiction is that it requires a suspension of disbelief (some more than others). That's why we don't cringe when Alice chases after a talking rabbit or Bilbo runs into trolls who turn to stone when sunlight hits them. If all we do is compare movies to the world we live in right now we're bound for disappointment. But...if we just sit back and enjoy the ride it can be great fun.",9,1,7,19 November 2013
