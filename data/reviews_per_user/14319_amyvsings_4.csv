Hereditary," I won't sleep for weeks
","Most horror films are pretty predictable and dumb these days, but this was a true horror FILM! Everything, from the cinematography to the musical score, made this feel so psychological and intense! There are scenes from this film, images rather, that are burned on my brain. I haven't been able to fall asleep without my bedside lamp on for over a week now. The acting is superb. Especially the mother and son. This is comparable to The Shinning or The Exhorcist in its long lasting psychological effect and imagery.",9,1,2,23 September 2018
Wind River," WARNING! graphic rape & violence scene very triggering
","This film is very well made. I grew up in WY and seeing the beautiful scenery made me miss it a lot. This was a very intense film that was very direct and didn't mess around getting to the climax. Great acting all around. The one and only problem I had with the film was the graphic rape and violence in one particular scene. I feel like it could have been left more to ge imagination. Instead, it was very realistically acted out in graphic detail. It was very triggering. The film should come with a strong warning.",8,1,2,21 June 2018
A Quiet Place," Finally a good thriller!
","It has been so long since we had a good thriller that was fresh and unpredictable. I saw this movie as a weekday matinee with less than 20 people in the theater and everyone cheered when it was over. I held my breath most of the time. It got so quiet on some parts of the film I could hear the A/C running in the theater. This is the first film of its genre that I can honestly say I would watch over and over (since the silence of the lambs). The acting is incredible, the sound editing was so intense! The best way to see this film is in theaters with the big screen and surround sound. Even with that, I'm definitely going to buy this movie so I can watch it whenever the mood strikes. I can't compare it to anything I've ever experienced in the theaters. Suffice to say I would pay full price to see it again. Amazing all around.",10,2,4,14 April 2018
The Wolf of Wall Street," Women be warned...go into it with a sense of humor.
","This movie is freaking hilarious! Seriously I was crying from laughing so hard on more than one part. That being said...it is absolutely and horribly offensive and completely objectifies women so if you are a feminist or old fashioned or have a stick up your ass then skip it and don't leave a nasty review. This is possibly Leo's best performance. I loved this movie from beginning to end, but I had to remind myself to be open minded and take it as an entertaining film because there are definitely some EXTREMELY offensive elements to it. It definitely pushes the limits of the R rating to the max. There is a lot of shocking nudity and graphic sexuality in this film so if that's not for you then don't go. It is a big part of the film.",9,0,6,3 January 2014
