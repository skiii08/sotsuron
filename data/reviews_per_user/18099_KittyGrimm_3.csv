Marie Antoinette," Good for nothing but insomnia!
","From the first ten minutes of Marie Antoinette (lost talent Kirsten Dunst) traveling to her palace, the next wandering around her new palace once she arrives, the next getting married and the next of her coronation, I knew that this was going to be a slow and uninteresting ride. I can't say much about the plot because there is none and I can't say much for the acting because there isn't much that's impressive to me. What I find the most outrageous is the fact that it was made into a chick-flick when the French Revolution was actually a very dire time in history. I'll give the film an applaud (though not a very enthusiastic or loud one) for completely stunning artistry, but sadly just looking at something pretty is not enough. The film, to me seemed like an old horse: pretty, but goes nowhere. Needless to say, my money and time was wasted on this film due to the fact that it was not at all reliable to history and was too long for it's own good. As much as I love visionary films, they do have to have a plot to them and Marie Antoinette had none. At least it was good for one thing: a cure for insomnia.",2,2,3,13 July 2007
Romeo + Juliet," Tacky and obnoxious
","The only thing that I can say about Baz Lurhmann as a director is that he is really good at adapting a classic story and making it incredibly tacky. Perhaps my hatred for unnecessary modernizations of classics has overtaken my opinions, but there is no reason to place a Shakespeararean play and put it in a modern setting unless it's going to be put in some use or say something different from other adaptations. Shakespeare Retold did so and that was why that series worked, but the only reason this movie seems to exist is to appeal to a more shallow audience without any intellectual value whatsoever. What I especially hate about this adaptation is not only how it pays more attention to the romance than it should do the feud between the families, but none of the actors look like they know what they were saying. Lurhmann certainly doesn't, which is made clear when he twists Mercutio's Queen Mab speech from a monologue about the challenges and temptations of lovers to a speech about drugs. If a director can't understand Shakespeare, or even has the nerve to twist his poetry that way, then he shouldn't take on that play in the first place.The actors are vapid, the direction is awful, the editing is terrible, the setting is tacky beyond belief, it's unnecessary and it's just plain insulting to Shakespeare's text. My only hope is that Baz Lurhmann pays more attention in English class before he takes on another classic. In fact, he should just avoid classics and save him a shred of dignity.",1,3,7,13 July 2011
P.S. I Love You," Not just a chick flick
","To be fully honest, I'm not one for what we know as 'chick-flicks' because of their tendency to be as predictable as a crystal ball or as cheesy as cheese. However, hearing that Gerard Butler and James Marsters were both in this film together, seeing as I adore both actors for many different reasons, I thought I might be able to stomach it and maybe even have a laugh. By the end of the film, I found this film to be more than just a 'chick-flick'; it was instead a bittersweet story about a young widow, played by the strongly talented Hilary Swank, coping with the death of her husband through letters that he'd written for her teaching her how to live and remember how to be happy with herself. All in all, I'd say it was a great film. It was one of those film that can make you smile, scream, laugh and cry and the writers capture the audiences emotions beautifully. The writer has clearly gone through the same situation of losing a loved one because if I'm not mistaken, I do recall hearing my grandmother going through the same emotions that Swank's character was going through after her own husband passed away. The acting in the film is perfectly done. Butler, though he can't hold an Irish accent very well, plays the role of a goofball perfectly, especially in his striptease scene and when he was watching his wife sing a sexy karaoke tune (poor guy was trying to contain himself while covering Marsters' eyes). Swank is also hilarious and in a scene when she's crying in an emotional breakdown, she plays it more realistically than I have ever seen on film. What is also great about the film is that it rebels against most romantic comedies by practically spoofing typical chick-flick events, which was a great relief to me, since the recycled plots that I see in too many films and books nowadays (*cough*Enchanted*cough*) gets more than just annoying. Out of ten, I will give it a nine because the only problem I had with the film was Butler's accent. Other than that, it was a great film with a well-chosen cast and a well-written script.",9,58,99,29 December 2007
