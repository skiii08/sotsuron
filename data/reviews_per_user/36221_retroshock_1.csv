Sucker Punch," 109 minute VIDEOCLIP
","Yes, that was sucker punch. Independent scenes composed to music, it was so huge, so monumental, so action oriented, with a storyline, which was created a three years old monkey.Did you ever saw Warhammer trailers on youtube? Or any epic fantasy or sci-fi game trailers? Yeeees.... Then you know, what I'am talking about. The whole film is a looong trailer, for a movie, which is not made. Interesting.Otherwise, I hate stuffs, when giants hit young ladies to walls, and only the walls crash, and the lady just smiles and smiles.... like a boring and stupid anime. Snyder could have to avoid these parts, and make the fights more exciting, because, if you know at the start of the film, that the character can't die, and can't injure, why should you be excited?",5,2,7,28 March 2011
