Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," No magic and not much menace.
","This pre Star Wars episode was less than anticipated.  It was obvious that the movie was based on the back story to the Star Wars saga.  Even with the minimal plot, the movie could have been more entertaining if the actors had been allowed more screen time. As it is, the movie is filled with scene after scene of special effects and artificial characters. Great if you are interested in seeing how far the field of FX has advanced but rather boring if your looking for a good story.",3,0,1,15 October 1999
