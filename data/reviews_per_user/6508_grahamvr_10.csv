Vertigo," ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE
","What more can I say that everyone has not said before. After 60 years it still holds up with anything else made since it. Bernard Herman's score is unforgettable. The color, production values, everything is so perfect and so Hitchcock. I actually visited the mission where it is set and it is so mysterious. It is now available to view on Netflix and I hope they will screen many more Hitchcock films.",10,1,2,2 September 2019
Lawrence of Arabia," GREAT
",Was good to see this on Netflix where I watched it twice. One of the best movies ever made and an exceptional performance from new comer Peter O'Toole. David Lean was one of the greatest directors of his time. Beautifully made and an excellent supporting cast. Thank you Netflix and Columbia Pictures for bringing this magnificent epic again for all to see.,10,1,1,28 October 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," GOOD FOR A LAUGH
","It's laughable....that's all I can say. It tells me my review is too short, what else can I say?",3,2,8,23 April 2019
Aladdin," What a waste of time
",Come on Disney what has happened at that studio to be producing such crap as this.? The days of true animation are gone and thank goodness I will be gone soon and not have to view what today's generation want in a film. So much cgi and badly done. Guy Ritchie definitely the wrong choice for director. I have never liked most of his films and this fits into the worst. How people could spend over a billion dollars going to see it Beats me.,1,6,11,8 September 2019
The Lion King," WHAT AN ATROCITY
","What is happening at Disney Studios to turn out such an atrocity? Even got a PG rating where as the original was G for everybody. Everything about the 2019 version I found a total bore, it was so dark in parts, watching it at home at day time was almost impossible. I watched the original straight after and finally I was happy again the see this.I thought the new ALADIN was bad until I compared it to this and now. I am certainly turned off Disney remakes. Hate to think what the new MALIFICENT will be like so I will give that a miss. Also LADY AND THE TRAMP I am sure will be just a bad especially with the Siamese Cat song deleted.As for Disney+, this is one viewer who will NOT be subscribing. I have checked out their first 300 movies/tv to be included and I can do without that lot thank you a Disney. I wonder if anyone from Disney ever read what the public opinion is? I will stick with Netflix.",1,2,3,20 October 2019
Les Mis√©rables," SPECTACULAR
","What's magnificent rendition of LES MISERABLE. Wonderful, beautiful, inspiring, excellent, beyond expectations.....I saw this when it first was released and now again on Netflix. It's AMAZING.",10,1,3,22 April 2019
It Chapter Two," CHAPTER 3, I HOPE NOT
","What a terrible waste of almost 3 hours which if had been told in under 2 it may have been more watchable. What a gross invasion of a person's imagination. I thought the clown was a clown but now he has turned into every unimaginable creature ever invented. If I could rate it lower than 1 I would. Let's hope there are no more sequels. All I can think is if the clown only returns every 27 years, at least I will be dead by then.",1,0,1,29 November 2019
Parasite," What a waste of time
",I agree with the reviewers who did NOT rate this as a 10. Incredible waste of 2 hours plus watching it. I don't even know why I gave it a 3 as I found nothing in it that really was of interest. How the Academy could give this Best Picture is beyond me. Ok I see it could get Best Foreign Film but NOT Best Picture. 1917 was a much better and well made film. If I wanted to listen to the babble of dialogue in this I just have to step onto the street of any major city or town.Another thing that gets me fumed these days is why credits are so small they can hardly be read. Even the title PARASITE is so small it cannot be read on. TV screen at least. And when will Producers realise RED CREDITS (not in this film) can never be read when shown on TV.I know I will be condemn by many reviewers on here but we all have a choice in what we want to watch. Actually I quite enjoyed this Director's SNOWPIERCER.,3,0,5,1 May 2020
Marriage Story," SLOW AND TEDIOUS
","Netflix, if you win an Oscar for Best Picture with this I will certainly be looking at cancelling my membership. Boring script with boring performances. The language used by mostly females is absolutely disgusting. Those reviewers who have voted this a 10, I really don't know what to say about that. Unbelievable comes to mind. If you want to experience this kind of story you just have to get married. OMG.",1,37,73,30 December 2019
Mother!," WHAT A WASTE OF TIME
","It is obvious by the box office returns this film was a bomb. What a waste of time, energy and money making it. Paramount must be out of their mind in distributing it. What more can I say except maybe I fell asleep and missed what it was all about.",2,2,4,29 August 2019
