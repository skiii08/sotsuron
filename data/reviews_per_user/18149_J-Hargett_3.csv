Casablanca," The G.O.A.T
","Michael Curtiz's 'Casablanca' was, to me and to many people in the world, one of the greatest movies ever created. What made the movie so amazing in my eyes had to be the story, dialogue, and cinematography throughout the film. The story was a relatable one, disenchanted lovers who meet again one day but seemingly cannot be together. The movie is magnificent at showcasing the highly interesting story of Rick, Ilsa, and all the dynamic characters they continue to meet along the way. Every main and supporting character in the movie was interesting and had depth beyond the surface. The story wasn't predictable and it kept me engaged throughout. The dialogue is one of my favorite aspects of Casablanca. Famous quotes such as 'Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the worlds, she walks into mine,' sum up the characters' feelings, emotions, thoughts, and the type of person they are all through their dialogue. The cinematography is also a key to success for Casablanca. The attention to detail with shadows and soft lights creates beautiful scenes that convey tenderness in characters such as Ilsa or sadness in Rick. The movie, overall, is a piece of art that has and will continue to stand the test of time in cinema, and rightfully so.",9,0,2,7 March 2016
Citizen Kane," Timeless
","Citizen Kane is one the most analyzed and interpreted movies of all time. Thousands upon thousands of reviews have been written about Citizen Kane and its praise goes beyond that of a 'good movie.' The cinematography is above reproach and is unlike any other movie i've seen. The lighting, camera angles, camera techniques, and the use of space such as background and foreground are amazing and really captured my attention. The acting is marvelous and stands the test of time. Even watching it today as a younger movie enthusiast the acting is still inviting. The plot and direction of the movie keep you interested although some have said they find it to be 'slow' or 'boring.' Orson Welles created a real masterpiece with this movie, even if it didn't see initial wild success. There isn't much more to say about this classic that hasn't already been said, discussed, and reviewed so i will only say this; watch this movie because it is a timeless classic that you will enjoy if you are a fan of, and can appreciate, classic cinema.",8,1,2,6 May 2016
Psycho," The best classic horror film to date
","Psycho is without question in my mind, the most intrigued and best display of a thriller/horror film to date. Beginning with Alfred Hitchcock's iconic style, Psycho is a classic Hitchcock film in its anxious, innovative, voyeuristic, and suspenseful camera angles and movements. The film also has a great twist ending that Hitchcock often favored in his films. The voyeuristic camera angles gives the film suspense and anxiety as you feel like you're there watching the violence unfold. Hitchcock pushed the envelope of the time with Psycho and its inherent sex and violence which aids in its timelessness. The story is riveting and kept me engrossed through the films entirety. The events unfold in true Hitchcock fashion leading up to a brilliant climax with a compelling twist. Anthony Perkins' adept performance as the charismatic yet suspicious Norman Bates only aded to the film's grace and tact. Norman Bates' character development is amazing to watch as it is slowly fed to us little by little; as well as other characters such as Marion and Lila Crane, or Norma Bates. Psycho is a classic horror movie that defined the very essence of the horror and psychological thriller genre. It is a film i throughly enjoyed and will continue to enjoy as it is highly re-watchable to me. The film is just simply, perfectly executed.",10,0,1,6 May 2016
