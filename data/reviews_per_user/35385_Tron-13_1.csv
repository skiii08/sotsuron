The Blair Witch Project," 'Wait, that's not a witch, it's Ned Beaty in a pointy hat and green make-up.'
","'The Blair Witch Project' is not for those weak of heart, unless you are slow of wit.  Its not to say that those intellectually challenged folks out there won't appreciate it.  It is an intensely shot film with very good acting.  The dialogue is fresh and real, and the pain and suffering of the characters is genuine.  The situation is not highbrow.  There are no black turtlenecks and large overflowing cups of latte; there is hiking and filming.  Then, why do I say that you need to know your Boccaccio to enjoy the 'Blair Witch?'It's all in the mind.  Everything, every heart-stopping, blood-curdling, seat-wetting moment of pure fright-filled bliss.  It's all in the mind.I don't want to go much into detail because to do so would not only ruin the film; it would allow you a glimpse into what I believe to be the most terrifying elements of the supernatural and the human mind.  Basic plot, three wannabe Truffauts wander into a local forest in search of a local legend.  They disappear, and all we are left with is the film they shot while on their journey.I don't need to tell you that.  Chances are, if you are reading this, then you know how to use the internet, and there really is no point in rehashing the plot.  You know it.  You knew it before you left your safe, dank computer dungeon.  The web was Â‘the' form of advertisement for 'Blair.'  In this fact alone, I believe it will act as a catalyst for great changes in how movies are advertised.  Finally, Hollywood will use the internet as we've been using the internet: as a resource, not simply entertainmentI've heard 'The Blair Witch Project' touted as the 'scariest film since 'The Exorcist.'  I felt it goes way beyond that.  To be scared by that, you had to be Catholic; to be scared by this, you have to simply have an imagination.  There is one scene which totally encapsulates the entire feel of the film.  It's the 'Close-up on Heather scene.'  If you've seen it, you know what I mean.  The pure terror that dances in her eyes makes even the most devout fan of 'Deliverance' afraid to go camping.Plain and simple, 'The Blair Witch Project' is as scary as you make it.  If you looked up at the sky when you were younger and saw bunnies and duckies, then go see 'Babe 2,' 'Iron Giant,' or some other family fare.  If in those clouds you gazed into your own mortality, go see 'The Witch.'",Null,1,2,17 August 1999
