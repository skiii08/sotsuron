Requiem for a Dream," A Masterpiece
","Stunning. Raw. Revealing. Unforgettable. Words alone can't describe how this movie made me feel, can't describe the film itself. It is at once, disturbing and inviting. Inviting because it asks us to learn about these people, disturbing because of the dark paths which they follow.In this extrodinary film, Director Darren Arronofsky takes the viewer on what feels like a trip to hell-or perhaps through it. he leaves no stone unturned when studying his subject-the drive to find a means of aqquiring the next fix, the emptiness in between highs, the bleak hallowness of a users life. It is made all the more remarkable by four career high performances. Each person seems to symbolise a part of the users 'Profile'. I won't go into detail, so as not to spoil it for you, should you be reading this before you see the film, but suffice it to say that the film is not for the faint of heart. It is, in the end, a film for everybody-for anyone who wants to truly understand what a users life is like. The film was given an NC-17 by the Ratings Board, yet this defeats a purpose: those too 'YOUNG' to see it, are the exact audience that should see. Trust me. I would never do drugs anyway, and this film more than reaffirmed I had made the right decision. One of the absolute most important works of cinema-ever.",10,0,0,12 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Here We go Again
","Brilliant Images and terrific sound, even more so if you see it in a digital theater, help bring this film to life. Therein lies the fault. this film, despite all its wonderful technological Prowess, ultimately yields a HIGHLY unsatisfying experience for the viewer.The film's attempts at humor go overboard, and the style grows quickly stale. The History, such as it is, is presented as well as can be expected, but, there are times when I, at least, couldn't help but think that it seems as if LUCAS has tinkered with what has already been established.Looking at the story, what little there is, one YEARNS for the middle chapter of the first trilogy, one wants the WONDER of A NEW HOPE, the CAREFREE attitude of RETURN OF THE JEDI. You will not find that here. Instead, you get Anakin Skywalker, whom from the older films, we know will one day become known as DARTH Vader, reduced to a typical teen suffering the WHINIEST form of angst. Even the Defining moment in the Film, Which serves to let the Viewer see the EXACT turning point in his life, is a bit of a letdown, due mainly to the fact that HAYDEN Christensen, who portrays him, has next to no acting ability. He is in fact, as banal as Jake Lloyd, who performed the role in PHANTOM MENACE, and once more, Natalie Portman shows that, while a Beauty, she cannot overcome her surroundings, and NEVER once rises above the material or her on-screen partners. Even R2-D2 and C3po are given short shrift. Yes, they play a somewhat larger part in this, but, what screen-time they get is wasted. Christopher Lee, always a marvelously Unique actor, seems uncomfortable in his role. EVEN YODA seems to have problems....Quite a feat, considering it is an entirely DIGITAL creation. The annoying JAR JAR BINKS....and this may be considered a spoiler, it may not, plays a VASTLY reduced role....yet one cannot help but get the impression that, perhaps LUCAS, if not winking at himself, which HE COULD be, I suppose, is rather, stuffing the atrocity down our collective throats once more? but, I digress. The point is, If you love Star wars, see it. If you love Star Wars, know it is not what it used to be. There are more Problem in this film than I have room for here, but.....I was VERY MUCH LET DOWN.",6,0,0,17 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," NOT what I was looking forward to
","OK. Yes, it's good-but not that good. it is, in essence, a very average film-look close at the sets, costumes, the makeup,the VFX-sometimes muddied, never truly breathtaking. even the great SIR IAN McKellen could not make this film move beyond mildly disappointing. I could have accepted the fact that Jackson wanted to tinker with certain aspects of Tolkiens work, after all, that is what makes an adaptation worth doing, but... the changes may be too drastic, taking away much of the FEEL of the BOOK(S). one example is that in the book, certain events take place over long periods of time,while the film presents them as happening far too close together. In this way, much suspense, and a deeper connection to the various inhabitants of the tale will be lost, or at least was to me. The fact that there will be a DIRECTORS edition DVD gives me hope, that perhaps Jackson had orders from the studio to cut it to a certain length, thus explaining certain lapses, but...look close, & I believe I may simply be wishing. The opening prologue is very well done, and perhaps if they had shown a capsulized version of 'THE HOBBIT', in addition to the mighty opening, the film would have more heft. as it is, certain Performers barely rank as deserving of a screen credit-most notably, and regrettable, IAN HOLM as Bilbo. I lay this films problems at the feet of MR. JACKSON-as director, he should have known better.",7,0,0,20 March 2002
American Beauty," Not what it could have been-Which was never very much.
","This is perhaps the most overrated film of the modern era, that being
the last twelve years, 1989-2000. The film is miscast, with highly
annoying performances from drab players. The set design is terrible,
with only its dark cinematography as a saving grace.    The direction by Sam Mendes is very one note, as is the ludicrous
script by Allan Ball. The usually superb Kevin Spacey is seen here
giving his all in what appears to be a daze of egotistical
self-indulgence, shouting his lines, grimacing for no reason, but
otherwise-and this is the unnerving part-boring you to tears.     Indeed, the whole film leads up to only one thing worth seeing-theend credits. But wait-that's not all! Spread amongst this cinematic
wasteland are a bunch of overly theatrical performances, including a
celebrated turn by the less than impressive Annete Benning.    My major problem with the script is that it is so flippant about
everything, and seems to suggest that such behavior should be adopted
and celebrated. Sorry. Wrong. If this film had its way-well, trust
me...you don't even want to know. So spare yourself the pain of this
embarrassment. Read a book. Get a hobby. Do something-but don't damage
yourself with this drivel-I beg you.",3,1,1,13 April 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," HUH?
","Why all the love and admiration for this film? granted, Hal is great, granted that the film has interesting sets and for its time, great visual effects, but...COME ON! as a story, it fails on many levels. the dawn of time sequence is prolonged to the point of distraction, as is the endless sequence towards the end, where, well...this film simply takes to long showing the audience details which mar the true beauty it could have been. like most Kubrick films, this feels hollow and incomplete. then again, maybe that was the point. it is not that people won't understand this film-the overall story is actually too simple for confusion-but rather that one may fall asleep during the film. I have seen this film three times, and each time I notice something new, something that does not need to be there. the first time, it was the score, which was a cheap way out of a bad situation for the films creators. don't get me wrong, I LOVE classical music, but the repetition displayed was overwhelming. again, that was another problem with it. too much of the same old same old. at times it is as if Kubrick wanted nothing more or less than to film but a few scenes in as many ways possible. As science fiction, it is neither a failure nor a success. it just is. as a film, it is just not my cup of tea.",Null,2,4,3 May 2001
The Mummy Returns," One of the best sequels ever?
","This is a piece of entertainment that could have gone down one of two roads: cringe-worthy garbage, or worthy successor. luckily, for me at least, the latter would appear to be the result. much has been said about the FLAWS in the place. for those who wish to make certain everything in this film GELS with everything in the prior one, just take another look at the original. much like the GODFATHER series, the Stephen Sommers written/directed MUMMY saga seems to be one continuous story. this film will fill in some gaps, open new questions, but mostly it will simply bring you enjoyment, if you have any sense of wonder left. DO NOT go into this thinking it will be deep or meaningful. that's not to say it is shallow, but rather that it is what it is: good, solid entertainment. The film is much broader in scope than the original, the production values, as high as they were on the previous entry, are obviously much higher. there are moments in the film that seem a little far fetched, but then that's the point of it all. Personally, I could have done without The Rock, but, then again, it doesn't take much to pull off his role. aside from that, I highly recommend it.",Null,0,0,5 May 2001
Life Is Beautiful," A Screen Classic
","Roberto Benigni's performance in this film stands not only as the
greatest of modern, i.e, last 20 years, comedic, performances, but as
one of cinemas all time best. This is not to underplay the importance
of his more dramatic work in the film, as both are stunning. It is
rather that I wish to say that this is true comedy, blending both
genres into an incredibly complex achievement.   In this astonishingly emotional tale, we the audience are introduced
to Guido, a character that at once seems fresh and close to home. Fresh
because we have rarely seen such energy before, because we have never
seen acting quite like this before. Close to home, because we can all
identify with him to some degree, because He is 100% human. The
inflections in Benigni's voice, the look in his eyes, the lines on his
face, the way he moves-I hate to make comparisons, but, if Buster
Keaton and Charlie Chaplin were combined, you would probably end up
with something like this-it all adds up to one of the most finely
wrought performances you are ever likely to encounter.
     This engaging tale is full of such passion that at time it is
overwhelming. If you have ever doubted that a story can transcend
language barriers, than this film should be priority viewing. The
characters and their performers come alive with such vision that at
times you may feel yourself drawn into the film to such a degree that
you cannot help but to cry.     Many people complained that the film made fun of a tragic event. I
say that it hardly did that. Rather, it is a monument which attests to
mans ability to face any obstacle, and overcome it,  even if bad things
happen have happened to good people. That in the end, we should all
remember how precious our lives really are, and that life is indeed
beautiful.",10,1,2,20 April 2001
Sin City," incredible
","Despite my score, the film is not flawless, but it is close enough to it to merit such a score. I saw this twice on the big screen, and countless times on the special edition DVD. it is a masterwork of technology and style blending together to create a noir hell of an environment. each episode connects and yet stands alone. repeated viewings are vital, of both versions, in order to understand and appreciate all that it contains. The strongest element in the film would have to be the visuals, and then, surprisingly, the acting. it's truly amazing the depth and life that Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke and others bring to their roles. if I have any complaints about the film, it is that I wanted more, and we the audience will get that in the forthcoming sequels. the film begins with a mans voice-over begins, accompanied briefly by a delirious jazz note, and continues through a scene straight out of a pulp fiction tale, before diving into the Marv sequence. I had trouble deciding which tale was 'the best' and have settled on the idea that each one is equal to another, and simply different. The Marv sequence is a classic murder-mystery Revenge tale, while The Big Fat Kill is action and the final tale falls somewhere in the realm of bitter love. each is extraordinary, and each is supreme in execution. The lighting, the makeup, and the special effects-which one can argue is the whole film-are amazing. the last comment comes from the fact that the majority of backgrounds and sets in the film exist only in the realm of digital code. Even certain characters are on-screen concurrently only through the same process. simply incredible and an intriguing glimpse into the future of film technology. Aside from Batman Begins and Road to Perdition, I have never seen a graphic novel or comic book brought to the screen as well as Sin City has been. a triumph on every level.",10,1,2,15 February 2006
Princess Mononoke," One Of The Best I Have Ever Witnessed
","Anime is not my thing. Certainly, there have been those films which I have enjoyed, but so few and far between were they that as a whole, I had little hope of ever finding a REAL film amongst them. then, this came along. A classicly styled fantasy epic, so vividly brought to life that it almost makes you cry at the commitment its creators have demonstrated. And it was animated, which was the perfect choice for this story. The music, sound effects, the direction, which honestly I have never been able to detect in an animated feature before, the story-it all boiled down to one of the greatest viewing pleasures I have ever had.     Now, if there is a complaint to be made, it is that there are sequences which seem a little overdone, or bits of dialogue that somehow seem out of place, or at least badly performed, which is surprising being that the voice casting of the English dub for the film is extraordinary. Aside from that, EVERYTHING else is pitch perfect.     This is a film where you can usually count the digits on a hand, and come up with the right number. Where when the breeze sweeps through a persons hair, not only do you see it, but you can nearly feel it yourself. A film that has the courage to show its audience something profound in a format which, in the United States, is sorely lacking. In this country, the creatures would all be cute, not menacing. Here, even the most docile of creatures has a realistic edge. It would have none of the philosophy this contains, and most heartbreaking of all, it would be overlooked entirely, all for the simple fact that it was animated. This proves the point that animation is an art form. CARTOON does not apply in this case. The film isn't for children, & I would never recommend this to anyone under 13. Not because of excessive violence, foul language or nudity, but rather because the tone and the complexities of the story will probably not keep the interest of most under the aforementioned age, or even interest them in the first place.     This is a film, which, when compared to live action features such as Excalibur, Gawian and the Green Knight, Dragonslayer, Conan, Beastmaster-it has only one difference: the freeing majesty afforded it by virtue of being animated. I mention these films as they are similar in tone and texture to this, yet, somehow, this surpasses them all. Not just the greatest animated film of all time, but perhaps the greatest fantasy film in cinema history. If you have ever read the ancient myths and legends of mankind, if you thrilled to the 'Lord of the Rings' series, then this is the film for you, one which manages to capture on screen what your imagination once conjured.",9,0,1,23 April 2001
