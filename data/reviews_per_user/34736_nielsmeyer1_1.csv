The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The perfect adaptation of an everyday growing teenager with a grownup touch.
","The best movies are the kind that catch you in a point of your life were you need it, at a point where you need to be remembered of how things were, how they are and how they could be. As corny as that may sound, I think the majority of people will know and understand what I mean by that. This movies is without a doubt one of them. For all it's grown up subjects and rather complex strain of thought it seems to succeed to show what kind of chaos a teenager is going true. Not the Hollywood kind of teenager where the majority of her/his problems lie in a 'complex' relationship with the parents, but the real everyday teenager who's real trouble is finding out who he/she is amongst a avalanche of confusing adolescent emotions. Trow in the other topics this movie brings to the table and you have yourself a movie that will remind you why exactly it is you love movies... I can honestly say that this is by far the best movie I have ever seen and probably will see for a while! It literally made me feel the butterfly's in my stomach again, literally...! And if a movie can do that, it's a 10 out of 10 in my bookAs far as the actors go, I really haven't got much to say about them other then that every single one of them fills in the character exactly as they should. Just to say it in other words, every character feels completely natural and none of them feel like they don't belong in the movie.I'm not a professional review writer (not that I have to be so it seems) but the fact alone that I felt I had to take the time to wright one for this movies says enough on it's own. Enjoy it as much as I have, I know you will...",10,1,2,14 December 2012
