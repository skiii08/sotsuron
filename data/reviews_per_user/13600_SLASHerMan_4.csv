The Incredible Hulk," Packs a punch (and not just fight-wise)
","At the very beginning there were some issues with the projector, so the opening title sequence was sadly never seen in its 'full glory'. But once the movie got rolling, it was surprisingly captivating.Edward Norton really gives us his Hulk-film - and as involved with every facet of it, he delivered a damn good one. The story is a simple one - even if you're not a fan, you could probably tell us what it's about in less than five minutes. But here it's (finally...) told with characters you feel for and care about. The humor is almost subtle, not overplayed, so it's funny without getting 'goofy'. The score and emotion is also beautiful - has there ever been a better suited main theme? It also has little in-nods (including four cameos of sorts and three other Marvel references) which is great to see.Edward Norton as David Banner plays to the part that matters. Loneliness, isolation, slight obsession (maybe desperation). He's picking up what Bill Bixby did so great, and paying homage to it. Liv Tyler is usually all smiles, but when her emotions get going, they hit you where it matters. I was skeptical about Tim Roth, but for the most part he does just what he should be doing.The action is loud and frantic, and the mostly CGI fight scenes were probably the biggest letdown of the whole thing. For me it's really worked out as a dramatic story with action, not an action movie with hints of drama. So after going through it with the characters, you mostly just find 'oh, it's time for another fight I guess'. (But I'll admit a few moments in particular satisfied the 8-year old Hulk-fan within).If your choice is between The Happening and this, you might find as I did, that (maybe surprisingly) The Incredible Hulk tells a really involving and exciting story, while The Happening remains pretty hollow.Give this not-so-jolly green giant a chance, folks. It's a truly entertaining movie-going experience.",7,2,5,14 June 2008
Watchmen," A little tiresome but well adapted
","This is certainly a worthy adaptation to the big screen. I don't know the novel religiously, but I know it somewhat well, and it seems sure enough that this film carries through the themes, events and at times even words.What must be applauded is that it dares take itself seriously - it's violent, dramatic, even a bit disconcerting. Not all heroes save the day, that's really the point of the entire novel and film. You can only harp on the heart-strings so many times (even Spider-Man is getting a bit tiresome), but when a movie punches you in the face, you have a reason to be dizzy.There are weak points to it though. I think the theatrical cut could've possibly been even shorter (~2h15m? come on, think about it), with some sort of absurdly extensive ultimate end-to-end-all 5-disc DVD/Blu-Ray edition further down the line.Jackie Earle Hayley gives a spectacular Rorschach, even his 'gravelly' voice (really described as being more monotone) and unrelenting quest for punishing criminality. It was too bad that the psychologist scenes were a little different (maybe we'll at least get the entire closing 'monologue' somewhere down the line, but I guess you can't have it all).Some say there's 'no trick' to Billy Crudup, but that's the trick in and of itself - to make a character seemingly indifferent feel human, earnest and interesting. He doesn't simply drone on, he's actually acting with every line and twitch.The adaptation works to the point where it's like reading - it couldn't hold my interest burning passionately the entire way through, but where it does work, it really works (the opening credits and Dr. Manhattan's origin comes to mind). The fact that it does work the entire way through is a testament to the original book, that there are themes resonating beyond just the characters themselves.At this point I have no rush to see Watchmen again. Whenever there's word of some sort of ultimate package, maybe I'll check it out, but there's a lot to take in, and it's mostly through the dialoge and characters. Hardly your typical action or thriller flick, but one to be savored on occasion, like (pardon the metaphor) a fine wine with enough years to it.",7,0,1,16 March 2009
The Dark Knight," If you only watch one movie this year..
","..then shut it off and go watch this one instead! Everyone has an opinion on The Dark Knight, and most are raving. Is everyone biased? Is it overrated? In my opinion, no. When hype builds up to a near frantic collective explosion (for several reasons), there's usually a letdown to be found at the end of it. Because you hear and see all the praise, but is it really that good of a movie, without all this going on around it? Yes. It sure is.It has a darker tone, but still a balance of skillful cinema and all the popcorn thrill ride fun you can expect. And most of it comes right out of the blue. The score always gives it a sense of tension and grandeur, and the performances are what makes or breaks it.We know Christian Bale pretty well as Batman by now - to give the character conviction (especially under that suit) is what he does best. In this he gives it even more intensity, even fury - but that's definitely what Batman is all about.Heath..well, what else could be said? Everybody sensed something right away, and it caught on. The 'Joker-flu' now has its firm grasp on most of us, but I hope there's still someone who will go into it and find the whole thing a pleasant surprise. Heath was at the top when he fell, but he left us an immersed, entertaining, surprising and impressive role. And at the same time very simple.Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman and Maggie Gyllenhaal are the ones that will surprise you. When focus has been off them for so long, you find that they are still able to surprise you just with little moments, as opposed to the big ones the two leads come with.Just see The Dark Knight. Hyped up or not, you shouldn't be disappointed.",9,2,6,25 July 2008
The Happening," Shyamalan leads and leaves us on a new path
","Alright, I'll say that M. Night Shyamalan is a good filmmaker. He's brilliant with punctuation and tension, and the cinematography is beautiful. In the end he tells very human stories, albeit with bizarre or unusual circumstances.But The Happening is no new Sixth Sense. He takes a bit of a new route this time with his first R-rated film - but if you're looking to see brutal death and mayhem, there isn't enough of that here to justify a ticket purchase.It's the smaller moments that count here, and that's where a whole world of emotion is told in just a brief moment (I don't want to give it away, but I'm sure you can spot it when you see the film). But if only the whole sum left us with as much emotion as those little moments, this would've been a far better movie.",5,4,15,11 June 2008
