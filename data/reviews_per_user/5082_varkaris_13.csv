The Blair Witch Project," shooting a horror film on a reality basis
","This movie instills great horror because of its originality.The actors are playing in a way of being in real life.Darkness,dim light,the tent in the huge woodland,the Donahue's sore voice,hunger and pain,shouts and inexplicable findings make a very terrifying and shocking film:an inventing method of filming that will capture the spectator.Though the movie is about 80 minutes long,the philosophy is fundamental bringing so many agonizing moments.Lack of music is so realistic but a little tiring.The movie will not convince about its final result but the effort is worthwhile and pioneering.",Null,0,0,24 January 2000
Citizen Kane," the quest for power
","A film belonging to the few that are deemed as masterpieces of the world cinema.Orson Welles at 25 directed this clever movie inspired from the life of multimillionaire publisher Hearst in the role of Kane.A film that was pursued to be destroyed but finally saved.New cinematography and sound techniques are utilised in this movie.The life and works of a very rich publisher controlling the media,his effort to become a political figure,his quarrels with his two spouses,his traumatic experience when he was a kid,his friendship with Leland and the search by a reporter about the meaning of the word 'rosebud'.",Null,1,2,8 February 2000
Shakespeare in Love," the process of writing the 'Romeo and Juliet' drama expressed in comedy terms
","Elisabethan theatre with costumes of that era. A William Shakespeare short of ideas. A lady can instill the inspiration. This is when Gwyneth acting as Viola but dressed as a male actor will pop in. Shakespeare will confront with another writer,Barlow. A very-well conceived movie with intrigue,passionate moments and theatrical rehearsals. Essentially a comedy in a world that forbids women to play in the theatre. A catalogue of efforts to perform a drama on love, hardship and unexpected events.",Null,0,0,25 May 1999
The Mummy," a fierce mummy chases the archaeologists
","When the mummy is awaken,everything can happen.The mummy is an executed priest who killed the pharaoh to live with hisbeloved queen.The priest was forcefully mummified alive. Adventure will capture the viewer with the wealth of Egypt. Heroes like the soldier,the librarian girl,his brother and the local bedouin will survive against all odds to bring the next mummy movie.So many scarabs will conquer attention. The mummy looks like the figure in the movie 'the fly'. The search for life,the thirst for resurrection and illegal love will build the frame of this interesting movie.",Null,0,0,10 October 1999
The Beach," a unique beach with no escape
","This movie will teach you one thing:never remove a tooth without some kind of anesthesia.Beyond this,you can enjoy the magic Thai scenery but do not expect act performance.The plot is not adequately interconnected.The meaning and the importance of any incident cannot be justified.The absence of any serious venture affects the originality and the creativity and the effort can hardly convince.6/10.",Null,0,0,15 April 2000
Notting Hill," love between rich and poor
","When julia roberts falls in love at first sight,what you need is a comedian like Hugh Grant to entertain with his sober face. Grant's roommate is spectacular,very natural in bringing a lot of laughing.It can happen only in cinema:a very rich actress loves a very low-profile bookshop manager.The life at Portobello street with the antique shops is enlightened with Grant's real soul and naive attitude to problems.",Null,0,0,9 October 1999
American Beauty," middle age crisis
","A suburban guy faces the problems of middle age. He meets and falls in love with the classroom mate of her daughter,a very attractive girl.His wife has a relation with a rich property developer and his daughter is monitored by the videocamera of a teenager drug user/dealer living next door. Human relations,sexual profanity,lack of communication between a married couple,adolescence confusion,rose petals reminding of the word 'rosebud' in 'citizen kane'(actually the developer is called kane).After 'american graffiti' and simultaneously with the 'american pie' comes a rather social masterpiece going for a 8/10 rating and nominated for 8 oscars.A good soundtrack with the 'seeker' by Who.",Null,0,0,27 February 2000
No Country for Old Men," Murphy's Law
","In the end evil wins: is this the message by writer Cormac McCarthy? But..is it? Where is consciousness? Police cannot help in this movie. They just watch the developments. Anyway, Javier Bardem turns to be very exciting in his continuous search for the taker of the money. Josh Brolin seems to be not so resourceful, he makes serious mistakes as the accidental cowboy who finds the money near Rio Grande in an area where the fight between drug gangs occurred. Existentialism can be proud as a theory that found ground in these characters. This movie is major thriller, different from regular westerns, pure antihollywood stuff. Speed is not so important when you want to draw characters and their governing philosophy.",10,3,6,9 May 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," abuse of insane inmates
",a masterpiece of good direction signed by Milos Forman and vivid performance(Jack Nickolson).Movies like this and 'Francis' draw the line on the problems in institutions caring for the mentally sick people.Human solidarity against the brutal conduct of the supervisors create the scene that accuses indifference.An end to lack of interest for suffering people must be given in a cruel society.,Null,1,2,16 April 2000
The Green Mile," the human touch
","It has been from 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest' to get the opportunity to see a 188-minute masterpiece with Tom Hanks as the senior guard in a prison designed for executions on the electric chair.A Goliath-shape prisoner,John Coffey,will change everything.He is apparently innocent but he cares to cure suffering people.Perfect mirroring of prison life,the adverse character of Percy,the amusing movements of Jingles the mouse and the all-around astonishing performance of Hanks with the real help of officer Brutus(Brutal) construct a magic scenery that will keep the interest unabated.It is weird that this movie did not receive any Oscar when its strength is so ubiquitous.At least 10/10.",Null,0,0,16 April 2000
The Sixth Sense," communicating with the dead
","What if Bruce Willis leaves the Armageddon situation trying to solve another problem? What problem?A kid is tortured by dead persons willing to speak whenever to whoever at any cost. A thriller based on the unexpected.It can help you learn what that dead familiar person thought about you... Child psychology,spiritual events and the meaning of death are questions to be addressed by this movie studying terror.",Null,0,0,10 February 2000
The Matrix," the good guy against the bad guys via computer simulation
",Keanu Reeves acts like a new Schwarzenegger to eliminate theforces of dark.A movie by the Wachowski Brothers(do you remember the Taviani Bros. ?) of the Italian school?Science fiction par excellence enhanced with too many visual effects to teach that the good guy will win again.Many combats that will create the next Quake-like computer game as happened with 'independence day'.A genious called Morpheus and a girl called Trinity will support the Chosen(the good guy)in his struggle against the bad guys.A movie that does not deal with real computing aspects but it rather purports to show some notional battles based on artificial intelligence.,Null,0,0,1 October 1999
Gladiator," justice must win
","An epic film everybody will enjoy.It was about time,'Ben Hur' goes very old.A new effort to give epic,touching and human moments from the Roman Empire at 180 A.D..Marcus Aurelius trusts only Maximus but his son Commodus will do everything to obtain the power.Great fight between gladiators,lack of big actor names,Spielberg assists in production uncredited and at overall this film will entertain for sure.",Null,0,0,6 August 2000
