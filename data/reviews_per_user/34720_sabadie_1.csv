Hereditary," The audience was actually laughing
","I am sitting here trying to wrap my mind around why anyone would give this more than 2 stars. There were many ridiculous scenes that brought about actual laughing from most of the audience. Acting was good, special effects were pretty good but this was a joke of a horror movie.",1,131,266,10 June 2018
