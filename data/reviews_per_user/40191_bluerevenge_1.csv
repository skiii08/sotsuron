Hereditary," Plot is cheese whiz, in the microwave, 2 min, high power...
","...Recycled cheese whiz, the kind that's been heated up in the jar before, poured on stuff and then re-refrigerated for more cheese whiz later, like this film.Let's begin by noting the performances in the movie--Collette, Byrne, and Wolff. Collette a great performance as usual; Byrne, didn't do much but at least seemed like he *wasn't* 'phoning it in'; and, somewhat surprisingly Wolff a splendid job as the scared, panicked, and guilty teenager.The start of the film gets going and we're already on a note of sadness and grief, starting with the funeral of Annie's mother and her daughter Charlie's clear struggles with it. Then it gets worse as Charlie dies in a tragic accident, while in the care of her brother. The despair of the family grows but the plot of the movie then devolves into trash...So here we go, on to the laughable and nonsensical plot that continues, which isn't even remotely 'scary'. Scary for kids perhaps, sure, but not grown adults. Seances, some contrived horse do-do about 'Paimon' and pagans and evil worship, and other hilarious stuff like that. Really? Gimme a break. The stuff many alleged 'horror movies' have been made of since time immemorial. It's made of stuff that scares you when you're 12 years old but people aren't kids forever and this stuff doesn't scare--at all--once you have some sense. LOL Paimon. Yawn. NEXT!Pretty hilarious stuff here, and awfully lame. I don't understand how filmmakers and screenwriters think this kind of stuff is still scary in this day and age? Give it a pass, unless you're showing it to your kids for a chuckle when they get all frightened about it and try to sleep with the lights on later. That really about sums it up--it's not a 'psychological horror', it's a kids movie. 3/10.",3,3,6,18 November 2019
