The Longest Yard," Jaihouse Crock
","I rate Adam Sandler pretty highly as an actor: Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish are among my favourite films and he is excellent in both. Sadly, The Longest Yard utterly stifles this talent - and the talents of his co-stars, including Chris Rock, James Cromwell and William Fichtner - by entrusting the direction and script to witless cretins. I probably wouldn't have minded the litany of movie clich√©s if they hadn't been so wilfully and ineptly used. To make matters irredeemably worse, just about every ethnic and social male stereotype is kicked out onto the field for the delectation of their young white target audience. I haven't seen the original, but I'm willing to bet Burt came away from this remake ruing the direction popular cinema has taken since 1974.",3,7,12,10 December 2005
Mulholland Drive," Reel! (or not?)
","I can honestly say this is the first film in a very long time that I have been completely mesmerised by; this film sucked me in whole from the opening credits - not only because Lynch's direction is so nourishing, but because the leading actors, Naomi Watts and Laura Harring - neither of whom I'd heard of before - were utterly captivating. If either acting or direction had been lacking then the film - more specifically, the narrative - might well have been disappointing. Not taking anything away from Laura Harring (or indeed the rest of a very fine cast), I think Naomi Watts deserves the highest praise for a brilliant performance in an incredibly tough role.Having said that, her role depended on an complete understanding of the emotional turmoil her character undergoes in the latter third of the film. With this understanding not only would Naomi have found her various styles easier to wear, but those in the audience with me who were prepared to spend a little time making sense of the story didn't leave the cinema dismissing the film as pretentious rubbish - as many volubly did.For those of you unsure whether or not you can stomach another film in the 'Lost Highway' mould, remember that the last film Lynch made was 'The Straight Story' and some of its narrative sensibility and honesty seem to have flowed into 'Mulholland Drive' because I found it a lot less oppressive and a lot more accessible than 'Lost Highway'. Rest assured though, you're still in for an exhilarating cinematic ride.9/10 and the best film of my year so far",9,1,2,23 January 2002
