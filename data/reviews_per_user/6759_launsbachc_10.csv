Casablanca," nobility and redemption, not to mention specs
","Aside from being one standout film with respect to the technical aspects Casablanca also entertains some very high quality characters. Through use of lighting, both high and low key the film creates a powerful ambiance that enhances the audiences perception of the different emotions characters are feeling at a given time. Regarding significance Rick Blaine exhibits a persona that reflects a man with noble character. Although he originally planned to flee a soon to be Nazi invaded country with his ex-lover and at the same time frame her husband for a crime, he realized the error of his ways and acts in great redemption before his lies destroy the life of an innocent man. Initially when his ex-lover and him reconnected, after they had spent some time together when she ended up in the same town as him, they orchestrated a plan to have her husband arrested for stealing exit visas and then use those exit visas to flee the country together. During the time in which the plan was to be carried out Rick does otherwise. He sees to it that the husband is not arrested and that he and his wife get a plane with the exit visas. Although his ex-lover demands to stay with him he persuades her to leave with her husband by telling her she will regret it. What is noble about this is Rick overcomes his sense of lust for the women and assets that she carry out the life she promised her husband by marrying him. This deviates from the common result of films that have forbidden lovers. Whereas most movie characters subdue to the lust they feel Rick acknowledges the importance of faithfulness and respect for another man over desire. This type of significance is seldom found in films but Casablanca is an immaculate display of such. Among other messages I feel this was the films most important and iconic one.",Null,0,1,9 May 2014
Citizen Kane," flashbacks and the unanswered questions
","Citizen Kane is regarded by many to be one of the greatest films of all time. As for its significance it bring a lot to the table as far as cinematic structure and meaning are concerned. With regard to the structure the film consists of almost entirely flashbacks and the revisiting of a dead mans best associates and acquaintances, including an ex-wife. This film style exhibits how using flashbacks as a films core story telling method can truly capture an audience. It forces viewers to ,like the reporters in the movie, piece together Charles Kane's life and story based on what we learn about his past. Flashbacks had never been quite been used in this style or to this extent. unlike most previous film when the flashback started and continued throughout the entire plot duration and most of the screen duration Citizen Kane continuously goes back in fourth from reality to flashbacks as reporters try and uncover the meaning Charles Kane's last words, 'Rosebud'. Considering meaning the films has a powerful and significant message. Come to find out Rosebud was the name stenciled onto Kane's sled that he is seen playing with as a child before his parents give him away to wealthy business owner in hopes he will live a better life and become successful. Kane becomes one of the richest men in America but is seemingly ungrateful to the man who assisted him in getting there. An old friend of Kane reveals throughout his life he seems to go to great lengths to try and please those he loved and was always doing things that would make him feel loved. At the end of the movie its revealed the Rosebud sled is in the home where Kane died. This implies that being given away by his parents made Kane strive to achieve a feeling of love and embrace that is unmatched by the love and embrace a child feels from his parents. The message here is that attaining all the fortune and success the world has to offer does not make up for the love we receive from being apart of a family, something Kane was robbed and the only thing money could never buy him.",Null,0,1,9 May 2014
Taxi Driver," captivating story
","Taxi Driver is one of those movies that stays with audiences afterwards. It depicts the new Hollywood's ability to really tell a story that seems as if it could be something that really happened. Furthermore, it is significant to the beginning of director Martin Scorsese's career as one of the greatest crime drama directors that will ever live. Taxi Driver reveals for the first time the effect things like returning from war, love obsessions, and living amongst a moral disregarding society can have on someone. Travis works as a moonlighting taxi driver and as a result sees the crime ridden and disgraceful underbelly of NYC. Being subject to this in addition to falling for a women who denies him as a result of his inability to act socially acceptable drives him to act in an irrational state. Among other things Travis begins to acquire several handguns (illegally), murders a grocery store thief with an unregistered weapon, seeks to convert a teenage prostitute into a normal girl, and attempts to assassinate a presidential candidate as well as displaying several disturbing outbursts of anger. All the while he his writing home to his parents conveying to them lies about what he does for work. Travis's transformation from a lonely, confused about life Vietnam veteran into a sort of deranged vigilante indicates he is going to do something drastic. The now psychotic looking Travis (got a mohawk and dressed in military uniform) enters the brothel were the teen prostitute works massacring the pimp, his security guard, and a man who the girl was servicing. Travis is praised for his actions and regarded as hero for putting an end to this unethical activity. But it is not clear his intention was to put an end to this wrongdoing or if this was simply the act of a person who was seriously loosing touch with reality. After coming into contact against with the women he fell for the closing scene shows him looking into his rearview mirror with a once again deranged facial expression. The significance this film has is its illustration of a disturbing reality and the story that occurs within that reality. Such a detailed and realistic portrayal of Travis's life would not have been possible in the classic Hollywood, signifying a new standard of what was to come of crime dramas and films in general.",Null,0,0,9 May 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," Overall Good
","I have to note that the characterization in this film is very good. It is as if you can really hear and see the pain each character is experiencing. For example when Tom first meets Casy the viewer can easily identify that he has drawn drastically far from his former beliefs and life as a preacher. Henry Fonda (Tom) does a phenomenal job of portraying the sort of rough around the edges but good hearted type. Most of his significant plot developing actions consist of him perhaps doing the 'wrong thing' but for the right reason for instance when he hits the sheriff. Because the film is centered around depression era Midwest farmers it may be difficult to connect with on a personal level. That said, one thing any whole hearted person can relate to in this film is the love and dedication we have for our families, how important it is, and how it truly reveals itself in times of hardship. To me that was the overwhelming social significance of the film. In the end when Tom is forced to skip town because of the sheriff he tells his mother he plans to fight for injustice. Although it is definitely sad I feel as if Tom gains fulfillment from using his edge and aggression to combat unfairness. Weather it was Casy's attacker or the Sheriff it was clear Tom did what he did for the right reasons and felt good about it despite the consequences. Symbolically as we see Tom off to seek his fulfillment it appears his family may be fortunate enough to seek theirs too as they hear of work north of the camp. Overall touching film and I enjoyed it. On a side note I think their truck may have been the inspiration for The Hollywood Hillbillies.",7,0,1,26 March 2014
Annie Hall," Romanic comedy standard
","Old Hollywood was brimming with movies that had a romantic comedy subject matter. Starting with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin's early silents, into the late 1930's with The Women, and on from there romantic comedies were a hit with audiences and usually provided a clever way for director to bypass Hayes Code restrictions. However, with the end of classic Hollywood and the new film era brought about the opportunity to set a new standard for the romance and comedic film combo. Director Woody Allen rose to the challenge. The significance of this movie is how much it differs from the old style and subject matter of romantic comedies and how several aspects of the films structure, plot, characterization, and mise-en-scene are still used today. In classic Hollywood comedies we see a ditsy young women either infatuated by a man or has one infatuated with her. They proceed to tease and lure men in via sexual innuendos, silly childish flirting, and of course pulling the damsel in distress card. The man is usually a weak self-conscious underdog, a well-intentioned good hearted down on his luck type, or the masculine every girls dream man. Overall they are always generic and seemingly artificial characters that lack true human qualities. What we have in Annie Hall is a drastic change-up from the this usual setup. The movie is narrated by the main character Alvy (Woody Allen) who plays an awkward, cynical, arrogant little man who works as a comedian. despite not appearing to as dreamy wonder boy type Alvy has quite the ego. Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), although somewhat 'ditsy', plays a women who attempts to hold her own and maintain a sense of confidence. Throughout the film there is drug use, premarital sex, inappropriate interactions, and essentially everything else that would have made code era regulators and old Hollywood audience gasp with horror, disgrace, and overall shock. However, the commentary, uncomfortable and awkward sex scenes, and character attitudes are undeniably similar to what we would see in any romantic comedy released in the past few decades. The significance that is more clearly evident is the drastic desensitization of film subject matter and how characterization and interaction was the key to making it apparent in romantic comedies. Furthermore Annie Hall seemingly provides guidelines to what a successful romantic comedy should entail.",Null,0,0,9 May 2014
The Graduate," unfamiliar scandalousness
","The Graduate represents an important time for Hollywood. With a new-era of Hollywood production (no studio monopolies) and the Hayes Code a thing of the past a drastic change in film subject matter was inevitable. In my opinion, the graduate probably exceeded the expectation of what viewers thought they were in for. The movie is about a shy, awkward, confused college graduate (Ben) who winds up in an entangled affair with the older wife of his fathers business partner (Mrs. Robinson). Later after a date with the women's daughter Ben beings to think it is her who he wants to spend the rest of his life with. When Mrs. Robinson is told this she threatens to expose the affair, so Ben goes and beats her to it causing a less then favorable outcome for himself. Despite the daughters newfound hatred he purses her anyway and it seems she is almost falling for him. In light of this the Robinson's attempt to rush her into marriage with another male friend of hers. Ben breaks the wedding up and leaves with the daughter. As far as the films significance for Hollywood it marked an era of film that would deviate from the Hayes Code style films immensely. The idea that a young man would have an affair with a mother and fall in love with her daughter, and viewers could see all the details transpire was very unnatural with regard to past films. Notably Ben and Mrs. Robinson are featured nude in bed together several times. At one point in the film an up close image of Mrs. Robinson's exposed breast is shown. These type of scenes and the subject matter indicated the change in films that was going to ensue. In addition the film does have a more traditional social significance. As confused young Ben pursues different love affairs that are based purely on lust he starts to loose his ability to think rationally. When the daughter expresses her undesirable opinion of him it simply drives him to want her more. He moves to her college town and essentially stalks her and begins to almost force her to consider liking him. When she is to be married Ben drives cross country to break up the wedding. Up to this point all of his actions had been out of lust. When he breaks up the wedding the daughter leaves with him the last scene features them sitting on a bus with a sort of unsure look on their faces. It is as if they are both realizing they weren't acting out of true love. The social significance this illustrates is the dangers of pursuing actions based on lust.",Null,0,0,9 May 2014
Singin' in the Rain," comedic fame and the underdog
","Singing in the Rain is one of America's most iconic musicals. It captures audience through a mix of music, comedy, and a story we all can appreciate. The film has both cinematic and social significance. As a motion picture the movie truly portrays the idea that musicals don't just be long on Broadway and in the theater industry but there is also a sufficient place for them in Hollywood. I'm hard pressed to picture the on stage performance of singing in the rain being as good as the movie. The sound, color, and lighting aspects of the movie would be hard to replicate and even harder for audiences to recognize and enjoy if it were preformed live. Through use of film technology producers of singing in the rain proved that the ability to edit, use artificial light, and manipulate sound quality has advantages in more than just the average film genera's of that time. Aside from being an benchmark for musical film singing in the rain has a social significance about the underdog presented in a comedic manner. 'Stage Actress' Kathy is a dancer who comes into contact with famous silent film actor Don Lockwood. He exposes her talent to his studio and because sound is being incorporated in films they request to use her voice dub over the horrendous voice of Don's co-star and avid admirer Lina Lamont, another famous silent film actor. Over the course of the film Lamont attempts to sabotage the relationship Lockwood and Kathy are developing while she fights to save her acting career intolerable voice. In the end Kathy is exposed as the voice behind Lina Lamont's and she is praised for her talent by the public, earns a job as a real actress, and wins Lockwood.",Null,0,1,9 May 2014
Pulp Fiction," Mind Boggling
","Pulp Fiction in my opinion is one of the greatest movies of all time. Whenever I watch a movie that keeps me thinking about meaning for weeks, I know its a good one. I have watched it several times and really attempted to embrace all the aspects of the film. What is most noticeable and significant about the film is its extremely unorthodox presentation of the story. Different parts of the plot are shown out of order during the screen duration. There are essentially three different stories being told that are all in some way connected. Furthermore, there is such a vast amount of symbolism, indirect implications, and metaphors the meaning of the film is very ambiguous. To try review all the different thoughts I have regarding the films significance and meaning would take several pages. In a basic sense I think there is a lot of redemption going on in the film. Jules redeems himself by not killing the restaurant their, Butch redeems himself by saving Marsellus, and Marsellus redeems himself by allowing Butch to live and escape L.A. like he planned. Note that all these characters are alive when we pursue the plot duration is over. Vincent is a key character behind the theory the movie could be about redemption. At no point in the film does Vincent indicate he wishes to make more constructive or morally conscious decisions. We know that Vincent is later killed when he is sent to assassinate Butch. Perhaps his lack of enlightenment is the reason his character does not live and the other who make decisions that defy there stereotypical self remain alive. Regardless the most significant aspect of the film is the fact the meaning is so ambiguous and the story is told in such a scrambled manner.",Null,0,1,9 May 2014
Psycho," Pushing the envelope
","Alfred Hitchcock is one of America's most famous classic Hollywood directors. A contributor to this is his directing of one of America's most famous horror films, Psycho. Aside from being extremely captivating and an overall great film the movie has a lot of significance in terms of both historic significance and social significance. For film history Psycho was one of the first and most iconic films to really push the envelope on what the current rating system, studio exects, and viewers would allow and embrace. The studio was not very keen on the subject matter and screenplay. In anticipation it would be a dud because of what they thought to be its bad taste, Hitchcock was granted a very low budget to make the film and most of the profits were to go to him. This proved to be a mistake. Psycho was a huge hit among audiences and made Hitchcock a very rich and well known director. Audiences praised Hitchcock and the movie. The reason for the studios and some others distaste in the film were its all around subject matter and some of the gory, revealing scenes. Obviously the most notable is the shower scene in which Norman Bates is seen murdering Marion Crane as she takes a shower. The scene was highly controversial because it revealed an unprecedented amount of nudity, blood, and violence for that time period. This kind of event was never (never ever ever) revealed in a film before. It is now easily the most iconic scene in American film history. Despite the controversy audiences were enthralled with the scene and the movie itself. Other controversial scenes included the opening one in which Marion and her lover Sam are featured sharing a bed together with Marion wearing only a bar and a scene where Marion is flushing a toilet that has toilet paper in it. Furthermore there was controversy over how the killer and villain Norman is depicted. Instead of the audience being left with disgust for his action the conclusion of the film makes us feel almost a sense of sorrow for him. It is revealed he committed the heinous crimes because of the psychological abuse he was subjected to by his mother, as a viewer we begin to attribute his horrible acts to being a result of this rather than him being inherently evil. The fact that the film was such monumental success despite its unorthodox subject matter for that time period is significant of the change in attitude toward film subject matter that was occurring in America. Viewers were becoming desensitized and willing to embrace and even enjoy racey material. This shift in attitude signifies the coming end of classic Hollywood and the code era.",Null,0,1,9 May 2014
The Wizard of Oz," a true icon
","The Wizard of Oz is one of the movies every American should see at one time or another. The most significant aspect of the film is of course its use of color. Wizard of Oz was one of the first films to successfully incorporate color and actually have it look astonishing. What is interesting is the transition from low-key black and white while Dorthy is in Kansas, to color while in the land of OZ, and then back to the low-key B&W when she returns to Kansas. Perhaps this was meant to signify the gloomy and hard life of midwestern farmers during this era in contrast with the majestic environment of Oz. The films manipulation of colors both in black and white and the entire spectrum helps to really make the audience embrace the ambiance in every scene. The Wizard of Oz also serves an admirable use of elaborate special effects. Between the flying monkeys, extravagant costumes, and artificial acting the film has an overwhelmingly magical impression. The film serves as a significant indicator of what was to come of adventure fantasy films. It set a new standard for film elegance that is hardly matched today. It also provided the truthful, celebrated, and timeless theory that 'There is no place like home'.",Null,2,3,9 May 2014
