The Ring," Not scary, cerebral, innovative, nor interesting.
","I have heard so many people saying they found this movie to be 'utterly terrifying,' 'that it was chilling,' and that you 'HAVE got to see it.'  To be honest with you, I fell asleep halfway through it.  This production was a hodge podge of sloppy acting, predictable cliches, and ridiculous metaphorical rhetoric.  I really wanted to watch a scary movie, but instead I watch a jumbled up storyline.  Yes, there were a couple of ghoulish scenes, but they were few and far between.Incidentally, how many of us are still alive?  I mean, after all, we watched the movie, and the tape.  I truly wonder how many of the people who have watched this tape are still alive seven days after the fact.  Now, a study on that premise would make an interesting storyline.  :-)",Null,1,2,14 August 2003
Final Destination 2," My synopsis, minus the fluff
","Good points:1.)  Interesting, unique, and thought provoking plot.  Not insulting to viewer's intelligence, like Darkness Falls. 2.)  Very good, if not excellent, special effects, unlike Darkness Falls, whose producers seemed to chinse on the effects. 3.)  Thorough scene weaving with minimal plot holes, again, unlike Darkness Falls. 4.)  The characters that you want to die the most, do, and in heinous ways. 5.)  Plenty of mayhem,destruction, and gratuitous violence. 6.)  Obviously a huge budget was approved for this movie,yet again (take a guess), unlike Darkness Falls.Bad Points:1.)  Jumbled dialogue between characters, sometimes leading to sloppy scene development. 2.)  Inappropriate and morose humor injected into scenes.  It so inappropriate, you almost could miss that humor was intended. 3.)  Not enough gore. 4.)  No sex. 5.)  Relatively predictable scenes. 6.)  Boring at times. 7.)  Dialogue when Kim Corman goes to visit Clear Rivers in sanitarium is stupid and unrealistic. 8.)  Throughout the film, lots of cliches, really infantile gestures, and crappy character development. 9.)  Mediocre acting. 10.) You actually hope for a violent demise of the main characters, instead of rooting for their safety. 11.) Horrible development of suspense.  Producers appeared to concentrate on gratuitous violence, thus sacrificing ample opportunities to develop true suspense and horror.  This is the primary flaw and downfall of the movie. They blew it here, big time.All in all at best, I give it a 2/4 rating.  That is being generous on my part.",Null,0,0,17 February 2003
Cast Away," An emotional, uplifting, and positive story of hope, faith, survival and perhaps Divine Intervention.
","'Cast Away' tells the tale of a successful and much revered Federal Express Executive who's dynamic life takes a surreal turn after he is the sole survivor of a horrific plane crash into the ocean. The storyline pits a business savvy workhorse against the wrath of nature in a desperate attempt at survival.At the core of the movie is a story of hope, survival, love, and faith. The movie explores the personal successes and failures of a white collar, high-powered Executive who's career and many aspects of his personal life are ruled by the clock. An unexpected and traumatic life-altering event removes Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks)from his regimented lifestyle bound by self-erected parameters, and deposits him smack-dab-in-the middle of a new life where he realizes that, ironically, he now has an abundance of his most treasured and precious resource-the resource of time.'Cast Away' is an excellent cinematic experience for viewers who have a strong sense of faith, spirituality, and perhaps even divine intervention. Throughout the film, Chuck faces obstacles and scenarios that make 'Survivor' look like a walk in the park. Everywhere he turns he is seemingly subjected to tests of his mettle and intestinal fortitude. Watching Chuck navigate each experience, the viewer cannot help but explore his/her own circumstances and wonder if they have what it truly takes to survive if they were left to their own devices. Notwithstanding the physical challenges, one must ask themselves if he/she could overcome the emotional and psychological challenges.Perhaps most importantly, I believe the premise of the movie is that you are only bound by your own parameters. You can survive just about any situation if you look deep down inside your core and pull out reserves you never knew you had. It also seems to teach you that you should never give up. However, if the situation is too much to handle and you have done your absolute best to survive, you may just get a little help from a divine source.Powerful, emotional, gripping, exciting! Highly recommended!",9,3,4,18 January 2007
Casino," Wickedly entertaining
","This is one of those gangster flicks where the acting is so incredible, you actually think you may intimately know the characters...but then again, I am from New Jersey!Anyway, Pesci is by far, the best.  He portrays Nicky, a real crazy goomba with a mean attitude, and a tendency to make people dead.DeNiro...what can I say?  Awesome as usual.  Don Rickles is even in the movie.  Sharon Stone turned out one hell of a performance...and James Woods, one of my all time favorites, is just fantastic.The violence is disturbing, but not gratuitous, and highly effective in accentuating the scenes.For sheer violence and authenticity, I give it a 9.0 out of 10.",Null,1,1,27 December 2002
