First Man," And it's a miss...
","This movie tries desperately to convey to the viewer, a contemplative and deep thinking Neil Armstrong. Instead, it is filled with empty moments of Armstrong staring blankly and seemingly not enjoying his experience at NASA, but analyzing it unemotionally.The movie itself is well made and there are visually stunning moments. But, I'm not going to repeat what many other reviewers have already said. Suffice it to say, It's boring.",5,1,1,31 July 2019
