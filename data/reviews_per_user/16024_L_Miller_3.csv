The Blair Witch Project," Did you hear something?
","If that phrase makes your ears perk up and your heart pound a little, then you are a candidate for Blair Witch.Lots of people have written, so just a couple of comments:<ul><li>Don't expect Kubrick-esque composition or a Ry Cooder soundtrack; just a little story that touches most people in the small secret part of their brain that remembers when humans huddled around a fire and hoped those noises in the distance would pass them by.  Let's just say nobody's going to put the Blair Witch on a Taco Bell cup.</li></ul><ul><li>Try and avoid the coverage before you see the movie. Particularly avoid film reviews and the '60 second movie' outfits of the world. You can still enjoy the film if you do read about it first (I did), but for maximum fear walk in with a blank slate.</li></ul><ul><li>The JumpyCam[tm] is distracting, but necessary. Those who complain that the film 'looks cheap' should remember that it IS cheap; it was shot with rented equipment by three college kids stumbling around in the dark scared out of their minds.</li></ul><ul><li>Before you do too many 'oh, well that's stupid' comments about what these three kids do, remember that you're sitting in a nice warm theater and not out there alone in the dark. Who doesn't know someone (or is someone) who goes outside with a flashlight to check out a strange noise?  They make some mistakes, but ask yourself what you would do in that situation if you _didn't_ know your legacy was going to wind up buried under a cabin in the woods.</li></ul><ul><li>I've heard talk of a sequel. Please, please don't do this. Don't ruin this little gem by trying to make it into a 'franchise'. Let it be a horrifying little slice of Americana and let it go at that. Please.</li></ul><ul><li>Be careful about seeing this movie, because it is not easily forgotten. My wife and I saw a preview the day before we moved into a new home; let me tell you, those first nights with the new sounds and the new silence got mighty long.</li></ul>",7,1,2,8 July 1999
Glory," Some inaccuracies, but a must-view movie.
","From the performances (I think all the Academy Awards voters who didn't vote for Morgan Freeman and Matthew Broderick for Best Actor that year should be expelled) to the battles to the search for what is right, 'Glory' has it all.  You know the details, and if you've read the reviews you know about the historical inaccuracies. That to me takes nothing away from this movie. I would rather see a hundred movies where the insignias weren't right with this kind of humanity and emotion than one so-called 'historically accurate' drama like 'Gettysburg' that recorded the events but missed the fear, the passion, the individual actions that make up a battle or a campaign. If you want the facts, read a book.  I'm sure the 54th wasn't totally keen on charging the fort. But they did. And that's what this movie is about, that's what 'Glory' really means: one finds glory not in doing what is correct or expedient, but in doing what is right when it is right to do so, no matter what the personal (being killed in battle) or social (being threatened with execution for leading black soldiers) consequences.  Maybe if schools spent more time showing and discussing historical dramas such as this and less time trying to be vo-tech institutes, violence wouldn't seem as glamorous or fascinating to the younger generations. Nothing about war is noble except the men who fight it, and 'Glory' is one of the best examples of that you could ever hope to see. If you haven't seen it, rent it.",10,0,0,12 December 2000
28 Days Later...," The less you know, the more you'll like...
","I think the key to this movie is to avoid the relentless publicity, previews and all the interviews. It's more effective if you sort of just ride with it from moment to moment. The DV camera work is initially offputting and sometimes a little forced but if saving $$ (sorry, don't have a sign for pounds) by shooting on DV allowed those awesome initial shots of empty London it was money well saved. The setting of England helped the horror because not everybody's got a gat under the bed, so if it's you and your baseball bat (instead of you and your NRA-issued submachine gun) against five screaming freaks that raises the stakes for you somewhat. Lack of CGI infestation means that the visuals are more personal than they would be with Digital Domain's painted-in armies of the dead. I think horror, especially this kind, is better that way. Some half-turns and questionable moves from the characters, esp. Jim (let me see, I'll throw down this Bullpup battle rifle for a more effective weapon...a bat! Yes! -That- will be a good upgrade!). I don't think I can put this in the upper pantheon of 'they're coming for you' flicks but it's serviceable entertainment. Owes a lot more to 'The Omega Man' and 'The Stand' than the Romero trilogy but suffers from a forced upbeat ending. Boyle certainly hasn't been a storytelling optimist in past movies, so I gotta think this is a personal declaration on his part or pressure from the suits to make a 'movie about people' (I guess that's as opposed to a movie about plate tectonics or oranges, which we all know are very popular.)Not horrible, not upper-echelon. The kind of thing you'll like if you like that kind of thing.",7,0,0,7 July 2003
