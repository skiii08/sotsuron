Vertigo," Beyond Amazing
","Over the years, this film has been regarded as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. Its been called the most personal, emotional, and complex of Hitchcock's films. I agree with all of these things except for one, this film IS Hitchcock's masterpiece work. All of the others pale in comparison to this. There are phenomenal performances here by Jimmy Stewart who plays the biggest anti-hero of his career and Kim Novak whose stunning beauty and exceptional personalities shine through this dark film. Barbara Bel Geddes provides great support as well. Everything about this film, the cinematography, the story, the depth, etc. leaves you mystified and transfixed on this dizzying, surreal artwork of a film. It truly is flawless. If you are a Hitchcock fan and haven't seen this you need to get up right now and buy, not rent, this as soon as possible!",10,258,378,25 October 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," powerful and captivating
","This movie has literally changed my ideas on relationships. This is definitely one of the greatest movies of 04 and all time I might add! The movie itself is confusing to a lot of first time watchers so you have to have a deep concentration or you will not connect with the movie on as nearly a personal basis as myself and many other people have through watching it. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet both give amazing performances, (Winslet is Oscar-nominated for this and Carrey SHOULD be as well), you truly feel for them as they experience what all couples shouldn't. The movie is extremely powerful and will not be erased from any viewers mind. Bring your girlfriend or boyfriend to this one!!! It will bring you two closer together!",10,0,1,21 February 2005
