The Ring," Not as scary or as smart as I was expecting
","It tries hard, but it's just not that scary. Eerie, maybe, but not scary. It also leaves too many important plot points unclear for my tastes; there's a thin line between being cleverly mysterious and being just plain vague. The extra scenes the director glued together on the DVD release help a tiny bit, but if a scene is important to telling the story then it obviously should have stayed in the actual movie.",Null,0,1,24 May 2003
The Mummy," Big Trouble in Little Cairo!
","Some movie critics seem to have somehow gotten it into their heads that this was supposed to be a serious movie. It's really not, and if you expect it to be a straight remake of the original film you'll be equally confused.Another reviewer here on IMDB mentioned 'Big Trouble in Little China', and I think that comparison is right on the mark. It's hard to say yet whether this movie will become a cult-classic like 'Big Trouble', but it is a very funny adventure movie with good acting, a few scary moments, and remarkable special effects. (And, of course, Rachel Weisz is pretty remarkable too.) Forget the misguided critics and just go see it. :-)",8,1,1,8 May 1999
Moulin Rouge!," Excellent. Honest and sweet in a way few movies dare.
","I liked some of the songs from the soundtrack and borrowed the DVD from a friend to see what the movie was like. Some would maintain that it's not a true musical in the sense of classics like Singin' In the Rain and West Side Story, and they're probably right, but that doesn't make it any less entertaining if you give it a chance. For all its pop-culture borrowing and frantic presentation it stays true to its message, simple though it is, and avoids descending into the tedious self-mockery and cynicism so common to many modern movies. It's really surprisingly sweet, honest, and moving. It may seem strange to say that a movie like this takes itself seriously, but it's true, and it shows. On top of that, the movie is beautifully made and everyone in the cast does an excellent job. I really enjoyed it, and I'll be buying my own DVD to watch it again.",Null,3,4,18 April 2003
Die Hard," Pretty darn close to the perfect action movie.
","If you want to see an example of how an action movie should be done, watch Die Hard. This is not a mindless gunfest substituting for storytelling. You've got a real plot, great acting, amazing special effects, and a memorable supporting cast. Combine all that with a litany of cool catchphrases for the good guys and the bad guys and you've created the quintessential action movie. BTW, while it's a great movie anytime of the year it's especially satisfying to watch it during the Christmas season, when the movie is actually set. Happy trails!",Null,0,0,13 June 1999
The Matrix," Refreshingly intelligent SF. Destined to be a classic.
","I fastidiously avoided spoilers before seeing the movie, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. What I got was one of the first SF movies I've seen a while that actually seems willing to let the science fiction be part of the plot instead of just an excuse for fancy sets and special effects. Not that this movie skimps at all on the special effects--and they're absolutely incredible--but there's also some intelligence behind it. I think that this one will go down as a cult classic. Cool movie. You should see it.",Null,0,0,11 April 1999
