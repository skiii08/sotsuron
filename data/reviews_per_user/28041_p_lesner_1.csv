The Avengers," I'm sorry did I just see another Transformers movie?
","Just like with transformers movie(s) I started to get very bored half way through it; it's as if the special effects are so overwhelming that the plot is lost. Now that I think about it what was the plot? ah yes... a bad guy (with a bad script) leading an alien invasion through a gateway/wormhole above a major American city (New York). Did that not happened in the last Transformers flick? ah yes, but the city of choice was Chicago. I went to see it because the rating was high, I was fooled. I still believe a good movie deserves a good plot. If you like movies that look and feel like a video game with the cheat mode on this is for you, but if your IQ is above 80 or you're more then 12 years of age and looking for a plot don't look here.",1,43,114,6 May 2012
