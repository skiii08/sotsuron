The Longest Yard," Could not watch it all
","This is not really a 'review' since my wife and I walked out of the theater after the first 30 or 40 minutes. It was THAT bad. It was painfully repetitious and predictable - and I never saw the original version.On the way to the car, my wife said 'I hate to waste the money we spent on the tickets', and I replied, 'Why waste our money AND our time?'.I love Adam Sandler and Chris Rock. They tried hard, but did not have much to work with.Save your money and wait for a good movie. I should have read the reviews, but didn't. I will next time.",Null,1,4,3 June 2005
Notting Hill," My wife liked it better than I did.
","Slow and predictable.  What did Anna see in William anyway? He seemed to me to be a loser, not someone who would be of any interest to a major (or minor) motion picture star, but what do I know?  Men are from Mars, women are from some other planet.",7,0,0,21 June 1999
Man on the Moon," Loved Tony Clifton.
","Tony Clifton: now there was a comedian!  I would love to see a two-hour movie centered on the antics of Tony Clifton, Andy's alter ego.  Tony was hilarious but Andy's other characters were, well, just stupid. If those characters were funny, then I'm the stupid one.",Null,0,0,9 June 2001
Life Is Beautiful," I couldn't keep my eyes off of their mouths.
",The dubbed-in English ruined the movie for me.  I probably would have enjoyed it more if I could have watched it in the original Italian with English subtitles.  It was almost impossible to concentrate on the story-line with all those mouths moving out-of-sync with the words.,Null,1,3,25 May 2002
