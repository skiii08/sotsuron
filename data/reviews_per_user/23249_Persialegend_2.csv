","The plot of this movie was far different from the others and the ending was very impressive.This movie can be considered as one of the best movies in 2010s because of it's plot and you can take 2 or 3 great messages that will help you in your personal life.The main actors and actresses played their roles in the best way possible.The most considerable negative point about the movie was that there were some redundant scenes.Actually the scenes are a bit similar but due to it's plot this movie has to have such thing.Overall,I recommend this movie to you, and you should feel obliged to see movies which are different from even the ones that are the best in the world.

Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Best in all time
",I can consider this movie as one of the best animations ever because of the exciting scenes it has.I really loved it as a teenager and it has two parts which include music.There are some circus shows that was really great(In Madagascar style). Your children or even you are able to take many great messages from it.There are new and nice characters in the movie.9 can be the least rating you can think of.If you want bring up your kid like a loser don't let him watch this movie. I wish all countries in the world would be able to make such brilliant and outrageous movies in order to teach their children good lessons. Legend.Of.Persia,9,1,2,27 July 2012
