Black Swan," Aronofsky Perfectly Mixes Real and Surreal in an Intense Masterpiece
","Ever since I saw the first trailer, I counted down to the day I would watch Black Swan. It has my favorite actresses Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, one of my favorite directors Darren Aronofsky, and ultimately it had the feeling of a David Lynch film. I've tried everything to stay away from any clip, review, or piece of information, even blocking advertisements with my hand on the screen. I was pumped. So pumped the night before seeing it I could barely sleep. With this amount of hype towards anything, it's easy to be disappointed. Black Swan surprised me. First and foremost, the performance Natalie gives is haunting. She always plays the character she began with even when the script demands more and her mental frailty shows throughout Black Swan. She handles every situation with passion and intensity. Mila Kunis also gives her usual performance that always boosts the quality of any film. Having seen all five Aronofsky films to date, I would rank them as: Black Swan > Requiem for a Dream > The Wrestler > The Fountain > Pi All of his movies offer something unique and interesting, but Aronofsky was never able to mix the unique with the realistic as perfectly as he did in Black Swan. This is his best work and, looking at his upcoming work, which in my opinion will underutilized this brilliant director/writer, it will continue to be his best work for years to come. Who knew a film about ballet would be so interesting? The story is brilliant. It's intense, passionate, frightening, sexual, sad, funny, demoniac, romantic, and above all artistic. Everything you could ever want in a film plus more. With that said, I don't believe Black Swan is for everyone, but if you found interest in the trailer than there is a great chance that you will love it as I did. I look forward to watching it again and again in the future. It's THAT good. With a year of massive disappointments, a year where boundary-breaking films were nonexistent, Aronofsky comes in and makes 2010 worthwhile. Black Swan has a safe place as one of my favorites in life. That's right, 'favorites'. It breaks away from being just a film and takes a place as a brilliant memory and piece of work that will stay with me for the rest of my remaining life.",10,4,9,23 December 2010
Inside Out," This is the Pixar I Know and Love
","Please excuse any mistakes as my English is not very good. There are no spoilers in this review.I had the pleasure of seeing 'Inside Out' at the Cannes Film Festival and I must say it was wonderful and a huge step-up from Pixar's recent efforts. The trailers don't really do it justice. The story may seem complicated for younger viewers, but the way Pixar tells the story fits for both adults and children. The pacing is in the vein of Wall-E, and in that sense it is very much a film for adults as it is for kids (like most Pixar movies). The story here is surprisingly raw and emotional, one that has very deep underlying themes that adults will connect with. Many of the audience members were crying at the end. It has one of the most original stories for an animation in the last few years, and I believe many people (especially adults) will form a connection to it.Speaking of animation, the film is breathtakingly beautiful. There is a nice contrast of colors that make it look vibrant, like Pixar's 'UP'. The voice cast did a wonderful job and you couldn't ask for better direction from Pete Doctor and co. I cannot wait to see this a second time with family and friends. Highly recommended.PS: The short that played before the film, 'Lava', was also beautiful. It was sort of a musical, and it was quite funny and clever. The audience even applauded at the end of it, myself included. In that sense, it provides the entire package a nice balance of joy and laughter (Lava) followed by deep storytelling and emotion (Inside Out).",8,136,280,17 May 2015
Drive," Refn chooses style over substance when the style isn't nearly as good as the substance.
","If I were to describe my thoughts on Drive in one sentence it would be that... it's probably the best film I have ever been so disappointed with. Yes, that pretty much sums it up. I hadn't been this excited to see a film in a long time. Needless to say, I expected a lot out of Drive. However I left the theater disappointed.The first half of the film is simply beautiful. You sort of envision what's to come. The characters are interesting, the scenes are tense, and the story builds along smoothly. The acting is wonderful. Despite what many say, I thought Gosling had a certain presence and mystery to him that a different actor might not have had. He played his role to near perfection and made it easier to imagine being put into his shoes. I enjoyed the subtlety of his performance when he's with his neighbor and her son; the way his face lights up when it's never shown but rather more 'felt' on-screen. Carrie Mulligan also did a wonderful job. I would say that the acting was spot on throughout. Even the little boy had the acting chops, and Bryan Cranston played his part as good as you'd expect (although a bit weird seeing him in a different role than Walter White from Breaking Bad).The story is well-told. The story has a lot of things going for it. You care about the characters and are interested in where it will head. Unfortunately, it ends on a very anti-climactic ending that takes a lot of the atmosphere away from the film, and it felt a bit rushed.I also thought the direction was hit-or-miss. Not being a fan of Refn (the director), I was surprisingly loving the direction he was taking the film by the mid-way point. After that, it seemed clear that he had run out of ideas. He over-uses the same shots and it gets tiring. The music, although in the first half of the film was extraordinary, in the second half it is borderline cheesy. It took me right out of the atmosphere, which is disappointing. Refn in my mind has always been the most pretentious filmmaker today, and sadly I still feel the same way after viewing Drive. He seems to love being different and doesn't care if it hurts or enhances the film, which in the case of Drive, his decisions do a little of both.To give an example, I thought the Refn's direction was sort of like how a child thinks. If a child does something funny, and you laugh, they will continue to do the same funny thing over and over, expecting you to keep laughing. You'll laugh, but only to make them happy. This is the same feeling I got from the direction. Refn throws something cool at you, then throws it again and again and again, while at the same time you're trying to focus on the story. It just doesn't work and for a relatively unknown director it's inexcusable, especially when you're engaged and immersed in the story.I still enjoyed Drive. Although leaving the theater I was disappointed by the missed potential, it was still a ride worth taking. Although not the best film of the year, it will still be one of highlights of 2011. Which is sad, because the outstanding first half made it seem clear that it was going to be one of the best films in the last few years.I would also like to warn the viewers about the trailer. I'm sure most of us have seen trailers for comedies that tell all the jokes, and same holds true with the trailer for Drive. It gives away many of the best scenes in the film, including my favorite scene. It is best to stay away from the trailer.That sort of sums up my experience with Drive, a lot of potential but doesn't deliver the whole based on the sum of its parts. Refn chooses style over substance when the style isn't nearly as good as the substance.",8,2,6,20 September 2011
Evil Dead," A Love Letter to Evil Dead Fans
","The best horror remake since The Ring. I wouldn't call it a remake though. It's more of a re-imagining of a classic horror story. It takes the perfect amount of goodness from the horror classic to make it nostalgic without the 'been there, done that' feeling and adds many new elements to it that make it its' own.While this may not hit cult classic status like EDII did, this is still an amazing horror film. The effects are admirable. You can tell they didn't use computer generated effects by the quality. I'm not a gore fan in horror films because they usually substitute the story for the gore, but this wasn't the case here. While I didn't laugh as much as I did with the original Evil Dead films, this was still one of the funnest theater experiences I've had in a while. You already know if this film is up your alley or not by the trailers, so critics are irrelevant in this case. A lot of love was put into this re-imagining by Raimi and the promising director Alvarez. The female lead was also wonderful and, as far as lead females in horror go, could potentially become iconic. She absolutely steals the show with some very memorable scenes and a face made to show fear. By the end of the film, with the perfect conclusion and the sound blasting into my ears, I couldn't help but think I was watching something special.",10,15,63,6 April 2013
Paranormal Activity," Authentic Fright
","Paranormal Activity is a movie that divides audiences. Some people will love it, and some will not. I loved it. The scares felt real and everything was authentic. If this movie was released ten years ago, I can imagine many people believing that the footage was real and the events did occur. Every time a bedroom scene occurred, my heart went pumping. This movie is 30% scares and 70% backlash to what occurred in the bedroom. I also loved the acting. Sure Katie was too whiny and Micah was too 'heroic', but their annoyance added to the realism. I'm glad this movie is earning what it's worth, and it's an example that anyone can make a movie and have it be a huge success. If you have an imaginative mind, you can make another Paranormal Activity-like success story. I thought this movie was superbly thrilling, a movie that I won't soon forget.I had the pleasure of viewing the theatrical ending and the original 2007 ending. The theatrical ending felt too cinematic and totally out-of-sync with the rest of the movie, as if the first ninety minutes was independent and the last ten Hollywood put together in a weekend.",8,0,1,23 July 2010
Avatar," Best Experience of the Decade
","As a film, you might dislike Avatar. As an experience, it's the best of the decade. Cameron had a lot to live up to as people placed Avatar alongside Titanic, Terminator 2, and Aliens years before Avatar was released. 'He delivered' is a huge understatement. The film looks gorgeous. This is due to the technology, but even more to the outstanding CGI work and Cameron's direction of every scene. The suddle 3D creates a more lively world of Pandora. The creatures, the Avatars and the 2154 gadgets are highly imaginative. It is impressive how Cameron was able to humanize these tall bluish creatures and makes the viewers feel anguish as terribly sad events happen them. My legs had a mind of their own at times during Avatar's exhilarating action scenes. What absolutely blew me away however are the affectionate romance scenes between Jake and Neytiri. Neytiri is an outstanding female warrior character that will stick in the minds of many. Her heart and love for her tribe sometimes makes her uncontrollably emotional and those scenes in Avatar are particularly spectacular. What Avatar lacked in a simplistic plot was filled by passionate scenes throughout, similarities of problems seen in today's society and the depiction of those problems seen through Avatar. Avatar's innovation is equivalent to how Psycho/Star Wars/Matrix/Lord of the Rings changed cinema. Cameron not only created a revolutionary experience that should not be missed, but also created a new culture, language, customs and race. Avatar will be remembered as the film that created the experience.",10,2,6,23 July 2010
Inception," A Phenomenon in Storytelling, Visual Action and Debate
","Inception is a flawed masterpiece. You're unsure as to what to expect going in but you're positive Christopher Nolan simply will not let you down, and boy does he deliver. This film, quiet simply, is brilliant. Going in, I felt a connection with every character as I have seen most of these in other films I enjoy. DiCaprio, Gordon-Levitt (500 Days of Summer), Page (Juno), Murphy (Red Eye, 28 Days Later) do an outstanding job while a few others that do a respectable job. Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies) gives a superb effort and a downright 'Joker' quality performance at times. Why do I call it a masterpiece? It is a dream. Take this as a positive or negative aspect, but you will literally forget what occurred in this movie a day later similar to a dream. Not all aspects, as few scenes in the film are unlike anything seen before in all of cinema and are simply unforgettable, but the main plot of the film will become a blur. Unlike Memento, where this occurred because of time-line transportation, this happens in Inception because of the several twists and turns it makes on the viewer. Several things go through your head trying to piece together what is happening that at times the movie watching experience becomes something greater. It is something unreal and new to the brain, and it is quiet difficult to convince yourself to believe. It's an extraction/inception 'how to' lesson with outstanding visuals.The visuals are like 3D done in 2D. It sucks you into the screen and makes you believe. It takes all our inspiring filmmakers self-esteem to an all-time low. It is simply unreal. Is it CGI? It looks too real to disbelieve but too extraordinary to believe.I understood the main plot of Inception that I knew exactly what was occurring during the film, but there were too many times where little aspects did not make much sense. Also, Inception takes thirty-forty minutes to get going. I instantly realized that the action was a major factor in Inception's greatness. Once the first major action scene started, my eyes quickly widened. The storytelling and the action are equally important in Inception. The scope of Inception is mind-blowing. It is as epic as the Lord of the Rings trilogy but is also set in a modern-esquire environment which is quite an accomplishment. Although it didn't transport me to a new world like a few other modern films with a contemporary setting, like District 9, it gave me a new thought process on the power of dreams.Inception is a rare case where a film is demanded to be seen more than once. It is easier to view it knowing what you have seen already and incorporating it into the storyline from the start. But unfortunately, unlike other films that offer similar questions (Mulholland Dr), I also had a 'so what?' feeling leaving the theater. I did not care enough about these characters to try to answer the questions Nolan puts forth, some of them unanswerable. I felt frustrated and confused throughout most of the film because certain aspects went against what I knew was going on. I wasn't amazed at the story itself but more on the idea of it, and the shootout sequences felt forced and annoying several times. But at the end, you question if these are actually flaws, or just aspects of a realistic dream. Nolan created a flawless film with possible flaws. I know.While not perfect, the overall package, I believe, will become iconic. Nolan has crafted something unbelievably imaginative in Inception, one that will undoubtedly become a global phenomenon in storytelling, action and debate.",9,0,3,23 July 2010
Mary and Max," Depression, Suicide, Drugs, Sex, Death
","Mary and Max is a well-crafted film for adults; it deals with depression, suicide, drugs, sex, and death. The plot is basic but the film is anything but. Mary lives in Australia and Max lives in New York. Both have lonely, depressing lives, until one day they become pen pals and their lives change for better/worse. I am excessively surprised how polished this low-budget film is. The attention to detail is unparalleled, and it might be one of the most unique animated film ever created, not based on the plot, but what occurs throughout the film and the themes you'll see. You will be wowed by their relationship and dialog and may even be able to relate to them. My only complaint is that I did not feel the emotion that many others felt. The creators did a poor job of portraying the sad occurrences in the film through screen; no need for tissues. Stop-motion movies are a rare form of cinema, and it is movies like Mary and Max that prove that stop-motion is one of the premier ways to tell a story.",8,7,11,23 July 2010
Moon," An Outstanding Achievement
","Moon is an outstanding achievement. Coming from an unknown director and an actor that isn't known for starring roles, I never imagined I would be totally mesmerized and amazed by Moon. It's difficult to explain this confusing story without being spoiled, so I won't try. Talk about being lazy, huh? The first forty minutes of Moon, which is about half-way through the movie, is confusing. Not confusing like 'The Usual Suspects', but more along the confusion of 'Donnie Darko'. It makes you think hard until you feel silly for thinking it was confusing, because it truly is a simple plot. There are two main actors, Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey. Kevin gives a fun voice-over and Sam is simply outstanding. You will forget that Sam is acting for two characters in the movie, meaning he gives one helluva performance. He should receive an Oscar-nomination. The director is promising as he shows the Moon in a cinematic -but simple- way throughout and uses great camera-work to make the movie, well, work. Moon is simply an amazing sci-fi like no other and is one of the best movies to come out in 2009. Sometimes simplicity is a great thing.",8,1,8,23 July 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," Brain Must be Turned Off for Enjoyment
","Law Abiding Citizen is a violent film that gets progressively worse until the credits start rolling. By half-way through the movie I was quite surprised by the polish and cinematic value I was getting from Law Abiding Citizen, but then it becomes absurd and just plain dumb. The acting is awkward. Two actors are thinking masterpiece while everyone else has cheesy B-horror on their mind. Butler, without much competition, gives his best performance, and Fox gives his usual great performance, while nearly everyone else gives the level of acting one might expect from a Saw flick. I despise the fact that there are numerous unanswered questions in Law Abiding Citizen. With all of the negatives said, I still enjoyed it. It is a fun mash-up of gory horror, action and a tiny bit of drama thrown in. Is this movie for you? If the plot interest you, then you will most-likely receive a little enjoyment out of Law Abiding Citizen. Just don't forget to turn off your brain first.",4,4,6,23 July 2010
