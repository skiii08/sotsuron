The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Boring Boring Boring !
","Even worst than first two movies ! Not what you expect at ALL ! Zero action scenes, after all its a sci fi and action movie ! at least some nice fighting scenes ! Just lagging scenes, drama drama, bla bla, useless scenes just to fill the time, just like a loooong introduction to the part 2 movie !Even if considered as a drama and love story, it still lacks lots of thing, and acting of Philip and Julianne is bad, it's like they are 'acting'. I just wonder how it got some high ratings, don't advice to watch unless u need to know a little what to expect from next part, but i doubt u'll need it cause nothing much to get from this movie.",5,23,31,4 December 2014
