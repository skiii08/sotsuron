Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," After 16 years of waiting : a big disappointment.
","some SPOILERS .............................................I'm really a very big Star Wars fan from 1977, and I was waiting a new episode since 1983. SO SORRY. I saw the 3 first hundred times, but only 2 times for the last one. (I'd got to see it a second time, just to be sure).It's just a Disney Cartoon ! Almost everything is synthetic pictures (the background, the robots, the monsters, the ships, the explosions) ! It's like if in the first Star Wars, Chewbaka, Jabba, the jawas and the Stormtroopers were synthetic, it would be a loss of magic ! Maybe in the next one, actors will be synthetic too !And the story ! The same line than in 'Revenge of the Jedi' (A ground battle, during a space battle, during a laser sabers fight). And the space battle ? Just 5 minutes at the end. The Vilain ? A very nice looking but he doesn't talk, we don't know nothing about him. In 'Empire strikes back' we remember all the famous 'The Force is with you, young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet !' from Vador. What are we going to remember from this film ?I think G. Lucas forgets the success of the first 3 was not only the consequence of special effects. I hope the next one will be better !",4,0,1,3 January 2001
