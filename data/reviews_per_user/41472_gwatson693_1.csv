Marie Antoinette," Awful
","Truly one of the worst films ever made. The cast looks hopeful but for this film they use the Sequoia National Park method of acting. Frenchmen with American accents, Carry On French accents. In all fairness some of the accents are spot on. French and German to be precise. The problem is the French speak with German accents and the Austrians speak with French accents. Steve Coogan can't get the English accent right and he's English. When the acting doesn't grate your nerves the music does. Who thought that a sort of Indie cross Punk soundtrack would work for a period drama(?). Spoiler Alert!!!!!! She gets guillotined at the end. If you did't know that may I suggest you watch Titanic? The ending of that will shock you. Sadly you don't get to see the fatal chop as a wax effigy of Kirsten Dunsts head dropping in to a basket would have been a highlight and made this a 'feel good' film. The howling crowd at the end of the film are brilliant. Pity that you don't get to see them. If you can watch this film for free I highly recommend you don't.",Null,1,1,3 February 2015
