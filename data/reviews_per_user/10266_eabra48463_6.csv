10 Cloverfield Lane," A Good Movie that Takes a Decidedly Wrong Turn
","It's difficult to write a review of '10 Cloverfield Lane,' because it seems to successfully achieve what it sets out to for the audience, yet it is ultimately very disappointing in the end. It establishes a great premise from the start as, its primary character--Michelle--is involved in a horrific car accident after leaving her boyfriend. She awakens inside the underground bunker of a recluse--John Goodman--who tells her the outside air has been polluted in some sort of attack and that life as they knew it is over. He also informs her that he saved her from certain death by bringing her into his bunker. A neighbor of the Goodman character is also a resident of the bunker and buys into Goodman's story completely. Michelle does not initially believe any of the story and tension is established from the start. Is the recluse crazy or is he absolutely correct? The film then takes the audience on a roller coaster emotional ride through some twists which significantly alter the tone. The claustrophobic circumstances are well-developed in the film and we feel like we're trapped in that bunker with the characters. The acting is also relatively strong and believable. The problem is that the film takes a clich√© turn as the writers and director seem to mail it in for the last 15 minutes. As an audience, we tend to remember where films leave us at the end and take that with us for a while. '10 Cloverfield Lane' takes the audience on a fun ride for most of its run only to leave us at the curb at the very end. It's not a bad film overall, but it could have easily been so much better.",6,5,11,3 April 2016
It," A Scary Movie For Those Under 12
","The film starts with a terrific and scary opening scene, where a young boy chases his homemade paper boat down the street in the rain before losing it into a storm sewer. At that point, he encounters the creepy clown and the dialogue between them is tense and draws us in to the film immediately. The problem is the rest of the movie does not measure up to the opener. We're gradually introduced to the children who will be the targets for the evil in the balance of the film; however, so much time is spent on this setup the tense start to the movie is lost and it becomes disjointed. The kids do a good job overall and are believable in their roles, but they are left wandering around in a script gone wrong. The adults in the film are few and far between and are reduced to caricatures and stereotypes with no depth whatsoever. What's left then is simply a children's movie with swearing and some gore. 'It' is entertaining in its own way, albeit is much longer than necessary; however, the film is not scary and does not measure up to the hype.",5,6,11,18 September 2017
Wind River," Well Crafted and Understated Thriller
","'Wind River' is easily one of the best mystery/thrillers to be released in years. The body of a young woman is found frozen in the wilderness of an Indian reservation and a female FBI agent teams up with a local hunter to uncover the secrets of the suspects and determine who is guilty of murder. The film is beautifully shot and well-acted by the entire cast. The director successfully conveys the somber tone from the beginning, due not just to the loss of the young woman's life but to the poverty and desperation of the locals. What stands out in this film is that it is all very real, from the dialogue to the scenery to the dim, cold surroundings. For much of the movie, the killer's identity remains a mystery, so the audience is taken along for the ride. The way the mystery unfolds is powerful and the film stays with you long after it is over.",8,2,6,28 August 2017
Dunkirk," Well-Crafted and Acted, Unapologetic War Movie
","'Dunkirk' is a powerful and uncompromising war movie. Christopher Nolan presents a hard-hitting account of 'Operation Dynamo,' the evacuation of Allied soldiers from France while the German military pounded the French army on the doorstep. Films like this hit the mark when they successfully pull their audience into the fray, making us feel the pain and desperation of those on the screen. 'Dunkirk' does just this and it does so without apologies and without sappy warm-hearted scenes geared to placate the masses. This film is dark, claustrophobic, loud and nerve racking--often at the same time. The dialogue is minimal, yet the message is communicated clearly and effectively. This is one of the better recent Hollywood productions of any genre.",8,2,9,24 July 2017
The Witch," Well Crafted and Acted but Unrewarding in the End
","The Witch manages to waste some of the best acting and cinematography seen in a horror movie. The entire cast is outstanding and truly convincing in their roles, even the young children. The film is directed, from a technical perspective, in superb fashion as the audience cannot help but be absorbed into its darkness and desperation. The problem is that The Witch spends its entire run time setting up for a climax that doesn't really come. The audience is left hanging with no perspective. The ending is so weak that it renders everything that happened earlier as irrelevant. This is primarily because the film takes the audience exactly where we thought it was taking us from the beginning. There are no surprises, no real twists and the whole package is just a well-produced disappointment.",5,1,5,6 March 2016
The Purge," Strong Premise - Destroyed
","This film takes a decent and interesting premise and reduces it to absurdity through poor writing and direction. At a time in the future, the government sanctions one night a year where all crimes are legal, including murder. This releases gangs of ruthless offenders on to the streets to do nasty deeds; it also feeds some kind of left wing dream as represented in this movie. The premise is ruined when the plot depends entirely on the players doing illogical things to keep it moving. The film is further destroyed when the writers turn it into a long ad for their political agenda. It is not worth the time it takes to watch.",3,0,0,4 January 2016
