50 First Dates," A Movie For All Seasons
","Lets face it, when Adam Sandler needs a hit movie, who is he going to call, Drew Barrymore of course, and indeed why not, after the sentimental success of The Wedding Singer, anything these two bright young things appeared in together would be nothing short of pure gold.A perfect case in point is 50 First Dates. Now as a rule i would never break out in a fever to go see anything with Adam Sandler's name attached to it, however i broke the rule when i first went to see The Wedding Singer, which contained many charming and heartfelt moments, as well as the comedic, aside from that one the only other film of note on Sandler's resume for me anyway has been Billy Madison.Like all good things that come to pass, in between the misses more than hits, along comes the last to date pairing of Sandler and Barrymore. A movie i missed on it's theatre run but more than made up for it by viewing on DVD then subsequently purchasing it.A lighthearted take on the notion of amnesia, with the emphasis clearly billed around a love story. We watch as local Hawaiian vet, Henry Roth, played by Sandler stumbles through existence, dating and dumping female holidaymakers, all the while searching for that perfect one. Into his life comes Lucy played rather charmingly by Drew Barrymore.Of course loves young dream could never run smoothly, remember we have 95 minutes running time on this movie, So as soon as they have met and broke bread, the dawning of a new day arrives, but not without it's hitch. Without giving too much away, just in case their might be someone out there who hasn't seen this film, regardless of the hiccups that ensue throughout.We are party to many highlights, which include Rob Schneider as Henry Roth's less than able sidekick Ula, Jocko the Sea lion and many many more. I personally never tire of watching it, not to the extent of reaching fifty times but i do regard it as a breath of fresh air, even if Adam Sandler parlays his usual bag of comedic tricks, but hey the late great Chris Farley did the same and it worked.Truly a movie for all seasons, and a must if you are in a relationship. A resounding 10 out of 10 and that is saying something for a movie with Adam Sandler in it!",10,68,87,14 April 2005
Orphan," Poison Ivy Meets Sleepaway Camp Meets The Good Son
","It has to be noted that since Dark Castle began producing movies, the majority if not being a remake, has been judged purely on the basis of how flashy the visuals have been, two movie that spring to mind have been 'House Of Wax & The Reaping.With this latest slice of Dark Castle horror, we find ourselves in what seems like unfamiliar territory, a movie which is neither a re-imagining or contain any sort of visual trickery, I say this, as I noted that Joel Silver was still at the helm as the main producer, and we all know that he likes his movies to appear on screen as big as like themselves.The story surrounding the family unit whilst not overly original does contain certain key elements that give the scenario some grounding, a distant husband, a wife/mother still coming to terms with the loss of her unborn baby, whilst still trying to remain resolute for her two already existing children, one of whom, a little girl who is deaf.The scene between the mother and daughter, when mother uses sign language to tell the story about the little girl ascending to heaven was quite touching.Of course this being a horror movie, the movie needs to gather apace, so luckily it didn't drag, so we the audience already know that the couple wish to add to their family by adopting another child to bring some form of harmony to the fold.At this point, the story structure takes shape, and we meet Esther, prim and proper and a dab hand with a paint brush, she can also carry a tune, albeit an old fashioned one, which when you see her initial appearance you can just imagine the way she carries herself both in terms of how she walks and talks.Of course such appearance can always be deceptive, and true to form, little Esther begins to carefully construct her ungodly plan for perfect family togetherness.As ever when I watch any horror movie, I always seem to find certain associations with other horror movies, in this case, the notion of a little girl being adopted made me think of The Good Son, remember when Macauley Culkin first let rip with the F Bomb? As for my Poison Ivy notion, I am not a fan of spoilers, but the scene where Esther dresses to impress and possibly seduce her adoptive father, whilst very uncomfortable to watch, it made me think of the Drew Barrymore original.As for The Sleepaway Camp Murders, remember the ending to that? Now that was a real jaw dropper too, So placing all those threads together, was the movie any good? Like I said before, the denouement was the biggest kicker, but it must noted that the acting by young Isabelle Fuhrman was quite something, she managed to convey all the elements of a femme fatale, from sweet innocence to sheer stark terror.With all the multiplexes currently showing the latest blockbusters, if you find yourself in the mood for a little late night chilling session, go check this one out.My rating is 7 out of 10",7,2,3,7 August 2009
Drag Me to Hell," The Alison Lohman Show
","As of this writing I currently work in my local Multiplex, my job description, would by definition go beyond mere cinema usher/popcorn flunky, aside from such tasks I also double as a ghost projectionist.As with such territory, I get to lace up the good, the bad and the downright awful, as with most multiplexes, the norm of showing a horror movie, let alone a decent one is a very rare thing.Multiplexes thrive on the masses throwing themselves through the doors to catch the endless streams of major cinematic blockbusters and as such when a decent horror yarn does come through the doors it very rarely does well.Such as case in point would be the remake of 'My Bloody Valentine', the notion of a remake normally sends a shiver down anyone's spine, although to be honest the vast majority of film goers I had spoken to with regards to that particular horror show had never even realised that an original had even existed.Luckily and this is were the good news begins to fly, Sam Raimi's welcome foray into the world of horror has seen a marked rise in cinematic attendance for a horror movie that isn't a remake! The audiences so far have been lapping up the on screen horrors in abundance and in all honesty so have I! As I sidestepped the adverts prior to the main feature, I took to my seat and waiting in anticipation.Luckily and thankfully I wasn't disappointed in the slightest! From Christopher Young haunting score, through to director of photography Peter Deming dizzying camera work, this was a joy to behold from the get go.It must be said, that despite director co-writer Sam Raimi's diverse change in filmography down through the years, it was always go to be the horror scene that his name would be most associated with, sure enough with the assistance of Peter Deming and a script co-written with his brother Ivan, this movie, although somewhat reminiscent of Evil Dead 2 hits every mark, in terms of style and content.Another plus is the excellent cast, although Justin Long plays a pivotal role in the movie as the boyfriend, this movie truly is the Alison Lohman Show.Just like Bruce Campbell's character in the Evil Dead trilogy, Raimi puts his female lead through the cinematic emotional ringer from the get go.Not only is Alison Lohman one sexy young lady but she can really deliver the goods on screen, at certain points in the movie my jaw near dropped at the sight of her on screen dilemmas as they unfolded, just when you think you've discovered which way the story is going to go, you find yourself having to think again.Sam Raimi has returned to the horror fold, perhaps for but a short time, but for ninety plus minutes he has crafted one excellent chiller! As with most horror movies, we the audience more often than not expect the obligatory twist.As previously mentioned, such was the delirium on screen, that ending truly delivered the goods.....as I have said to many a customer, watch out for that ending! Phew what a scorcher! My one and only hope, no matter what Drag Me To Hell makes at the box office, be it here in the U.K. or overseas, I sincerely hope that Ghost House Pictures don't feel the need to carry on the story with a sequel...The notion of Drag Me To Hell Too doesn't sound quite so inviting.My rating for this movie, without hesitation, is 10/10",10,0,4,8 June 2009
Music and Lyrics," The Citizen Kane Of Romantic Comedies
","For as long as I can remember, my movie viewing of choice has always been the horror movie, or to be more precise, the B horror movie.However since I got married a few years back, my viewing habits have gradually changed, I still find time to watch the odd horror flick that warrants my attention.As with marriage, you have to share and care for one another, and I would never dream of making my good lady sit down and watch such demented delights as 'Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers', the mere mention of title practically makes her raise an eyebrow, so such delights I often leave for myself to recall with fondness.That being said, having worked in video Shops, and cinemas down through the years, I have often decided to swerve anything that remotely contained the romantic comedy angle, but the love of my wife is such, and rather than ruin such romantic interludes as Valentine's Day or a romantic date for two out to the cinema, I more or less have opened my mind to other cinematic possibilities.So as the years have passed, such suspect delights like 'Love Actually' 'Pretty Woman' have left an indelible impression upon my festering heart.Such a similar case can also be said for this slice of rom-com candy floss. Initially the notion of watching Hugh Grant in any sort of movie would fill me with deepest fear.However my guard was down one night, in popped the DVD and there I found myself hooked.As has often been the notion, whenever you have the very beautiful Drew Barrymore in a movie, more often than not, you would be guaranteed some modicum of entertainment.Just ask Adam Sandler, whenever he needed a romantic comedy to fly at the box office, a simple call to Drew would more or less bring multiplex cinemas to their collective knees.Beyond anything else that Mr Sandler has made before or since, both 'The Wedding Singer' & '50 First Dates' will always rank highly for me as pure romantic comedy entertainment.Perhaps, such a notion also entered into the mind of writer/director Marc Lawrence, when it came time to cast this very fine movie.Granted not all of the movies mentioned will have made mega bucks, but their legions of fans will have guaranteed that the DVD sales would have wanted similar parings.If we were to be honest, Hugh Grant's acting talent is pretty much focused on that one character trait, that of the foppish cad, and as long as the project suits the actor, then the movie will always be given the green light.Now I haven't watched 'Two Weeks Notice' Or 'Miss Congeniality' but during my video shop days, both these titles always flew off the shelves.As has been mentioned many times previous writer/director Marc Lawrence certainly has a way with the written word, and this is certainly on display here.Both Hugh Grant & Drew Barrymore work very well together, Drew as ever showing that slight glimmer of vulnerability which is always endearing in movie of this type.Couple their performances, with the witty script as well as the very excellent soundtrack, which I have since purchased, and cannot stop playing, especially the main track 'Way Back Into Love' this movie in my humble opinion, is truly a wonderful experience, that really makes you feel spot on inside.The additional performers in the movie also add a touch of class to the proceedings, especially Brad Garrett and the very sexy Kristen Johnston.More often than not, certain films can withstand the test of time and become true classics of their respective genre, okay so this movie might not reach the fevered heights of acclaim of 'Gone With The Wind' or 'The Wizard Of Oz'.However for me this movie could possibly be the 'Citizen Kane' of romantic comedies, but the again, I'm the guy who loves his horror movies, but as my wife often says, 'Give it time my love'.My rating for this movie is 10/10",10,6,14,15 February 2009
