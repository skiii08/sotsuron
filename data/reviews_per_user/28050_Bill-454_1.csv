The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Pittsburgh? Seriously?
","I have cousins in Pittsburgh. I have a friend from Delaware who now speaks Pittsburghese. Not ONE character sounds like they are from anywhere near Pittsburgh. Great film though. Too bad the producers thought that everyone should sound like they are from California. Maybe they should have hired better actors. I bet Emma Watson could have done a Pittsburgh accent, because no American actor can. The best South Philly accent ever came from Australian Toni Collette in SIXTH SENSE.",8,0,0,18 May 2020
