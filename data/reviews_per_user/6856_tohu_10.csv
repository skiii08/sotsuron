50 First Dates," Standard feel-good rom-com
","The key to whether you should watch this film is how much you can stomach Adam Sandler. If you think he's great you'll love this. If you can't stand him then you will probably not find much here to distract you from that.Personally, I've never been a fan of his. But I watched this because I quite liked the idea of this film. Let's face it - it's not often you get a movie about a woman (Drew Barrymore) who is involved in an accident which leaves her with a 24-hour memory span so that her would-be boyfriend has to make up ways to 'meet' and make her fall in love with him every day. So I watched it, and it was OK. A good few laughs plus some nice 'aaaah' moments and a pleasing soundtrack thrown in as well.Downsides? I could have done without some of the annoying sidekicks. Admittedly the two leads couldn't have sustained the whole film on their own, but for me there are a few too many 'quirky' hangers-on, playing - largely unsuccessfully - for laughs. The exceptions to this include the slightly more classy turns from Dan Ayckroyd as the doctor, Blake Clark as the girl's father, and the show-stealing walrus who is the star attraction at the zoo where Sandler's character works as a vet.So overall, 50 First Dates is not great, but it doesn't pretend to be. It's a nice, amusing, diverting, feel-good movie that will leave you with a smile on your face and - just possibly - make you despise the male lead a little less than you did before.",6,11,21,21 April 2007
The Caine Mutiny," Superb second half, pity about the first hour.
","This is a film of two halves. The first half is dreary and below average. The second half is superb.That excellent second half of the movie concerns the actual mutiny that took place aboard the USS Caine. The principled, anguished officers (played by Van Johnson and Robert Francis) are egged on by their two-faced shyster colleague (Fred MacMurray) to take command of the ship from the increasingly paranoid captain (Humphrey Bogart). Whether they were right to do so is then played out in a superb courtroom drama, where military lawyers (E.G. Marshall and Jose Ferrer) take opposing sides in questioning all involved.This part of the film - the mutiny and its aftermath - is gripping, brilliantly acted and full of aching moral dilemmas. Bogart, in one of his final screen roles, is absolutely magnificent as the flawed anti-hero, and MacMurray, Marshall and Ferrer also give great performances. Indeed, if the film consisted of just this part of the story it would be one of the best of its kind.Unfortunately, someone in the production team decided that this drama needed a long introduction, so we have to sit through a meandering first hour before we get to the meat of the movie. Some of this over-long first hour is given to character development, but too much of it concerns unnecessary side-shows like the completely superfluous love affair between Francis's character and his sweetheart back home. The result is that many viewers will have switched off from the movie (either emotionally or literally) before the good stuff begins.And that's a real shame because this really does mar what could have been a great film. I'm almost tempted to recommend that you should switch on after the first hour and just watch it from there - but that would be to disrespect the film. It is what it is and films should be judged on their entirety, not in segments (however tempting it is to do so).So, on that basis, The Caine Mutiny deserves a 6, when without the first hour it could have garnered a 9. In production terms, for a film made in 1954, it looks terrific (though the widescreen shots of the ship being tossed on the waves during the typhoon scene lack the reality of more modern effects) and it is the acting of the leads that stays in your mind long after the film is over.Given what I've said, I suppose the question that matters is: is the latter part of the film good enough to make it worth your while sitting through the slow beginning? And the answer is yes. After all, there are some great actors on display here, and in top form too. At the end of the day, that has to be worth waiting for.",6,10,17,2 November 2007
Cast Away," Another good Hanks movie
","Tom Hanks is an interesting actor. Or rather, the reactions he provokes are interesting. There are those who love him and those who scratch their heads wondering why he has achieved such extraordinary success in his career. He is after all quite 'ordinary.' He is not a great actor, though not a particularly bad one. His main claim to fame seems to be his unfailing ability to generate sympathy from the audience for the characters he plays. You always 'like' Hanks in his film roles. Varied as they are, that's quite an achievement. And it is based on that very ordinariness that many of us seem to find perplexing.Cast Away is a very good example of this. Hanks has to hold the attention of the audience for the bulk of the film, as he is the only human character on screen. The vast, inescapable power of the ocean and the primitive beauty of the island vie with him for that attention, but come off worst. He is certainly not the only actor who could pull this off, but it is still a neat trick and there were certainly many who felt in the run-up to the launch of the film that this would be the one that finally found him out as a rather average talent. It does no such thing.He slowly draws you into the predicament of his character and persuades you to suspend the cynicism that might make you question a number of the events in the plot. And, true to form, he has you firmly on his side at all the most critical moments. The direction and photography both help to sustain the illusion of what you are seeing, and the plot - though faintly ridiculous - has enough meat in it to allow the drama to play out.Though the period of isolation on the island is the main body of this film, one of the more interesting aspects for me was the way the character inter-acted with the real world. Without giving anything away, there is a deeply emotional thread to this story about an intense personal relationship that is destroyed by cruel events and this, I found to my surprise, provided some of the most impressive scenes towards the end of the film.Rating Cast Away was for me a decision between 7 and 8. I went for 8 in the end, perhaps generously, because it is basically a feel-good movie which works. You should not watch it expecting much more than that. Few deep human questions are asked here, and when reviewing the plot after the film has finished you conclude that - even as it held your attention at the time - it was in fact quite formulaic.Nevertheless it is, as I said, another classic Tom Hanks movie. And these have become almost a genre in themselves. If you like The Terminal, The Ladykillers, Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, you'll enjoy this film too - essentially for the same reason: the star himself.",8,0,0,30 May 2006
Judgment at Nuremberg," A Must-See Film
","Every now and again you see a film that you think needs to be seen by everybody. This is such a film. You really are depriving yourself of a life-enhancing experience if you miss it.It is essentially a courtroom drama, exposing the true horrors of the Nazi regime. While many of the leading Nazis were indeed tried at Nuremberg for war crimes in the late 1940s, the co-accused in this case are fictional characters, which allows the actors and writer the luxury of concentrating on emotions and themes rather than impersonations.Spencer Tracy excels as the world-weary American Judge brought in to preside over the case. He is a man on a journey, trying desperately to discover a rational basis for what has happened to a once great people. His quiet style contrasts with the fiery passion displayed by both the Defence Counsel Maximilian Schell, a proud, intelligent young German determined to establish that not all his countrymen are to blame for the brutality of the Nazi regime, and lead Prosecutor Richard Widmark, a bitter military man who is set only on vengeance and retribution.Schell's character deserves some explanation. This is no Nazi. His love for his country is based not on the Germany of Hitler but of Bismarck and before. Impressive and eloquent, he battles doggedly against the odds because he genuinely believes that the interests of Germany and the wider world will be better served by forgiveness and absolution, rather than Widmark's brutal, indiscriminate revenge. Schnell rightly won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for conveying all this. The only wonder, for me, is that none of the other players joined him on the Academy's lists.The most impressive of the four defendants is the noble law professor played by Burt Lancaster. But for me, one of the best performances in this film of great acting all round is that by Werner Klemperer, as the only truly unrepentant Nazi, exuding menace and resentment from every pore. The female interest is provided by Marlene Dietrich, the aristocratic widow of a leading Nazi official, whose house has been confiscated and given to Tracy's character for the duration of the trial. The two strike up an unlikely friendship, the tenderness of which contrasts starkly with the harsh reality exposed in the courtroom. One of the best scenes in the film is Dietrich's sad translation of the words of 'Lili Marlene' as it is sung by sombre passers-by as she is walked home by Tracy. It turns out to be an even more tragic song than we had imagined, and as such stands as a poignant symbol of the case as a whole.I like courtroom dramas. They provide claustrophobic settings which seem to breed great performances and tense, dramatic conflicts. There is no love lost between the two young lawyers in this film, and their exchanges are explosive. Nor is there any camaraderie between the four defendants, lurking in the dock in their varying degrees of denial and repentance. An array of tragic witnesses proceeds through the trial - the most notable being played by a troubled Judy Garland - and Tracey's quest for understanding puts him at odds with his fellow Judges on the case. It is a film therefore of individuals. Apart from the faltering liaison between Tracy and Dietrich, few partnerships are formed. Its bleak structure in this sense mirrors the tightly drawn courtroom setting and the ruined, desolate streets created by Kramer to evoke the post-war reality of German misery and shame.We share the shock and horror of the court as the full extent of the atrocities are revealed for the first time. And just as we think the film can't get any better, Tracy makes his final summing up speech: an 11-minute masterpiece, eloquently written and perfectly presented (allegedly in a single take). It stands up even today as a flawless exposition of uncompromising humanity. It is not the final scene of the film however. That comes a little later, between Tracy and Lancaster, and the closing line is - quite simply - devastating.You must see this film. It is the kind of cinematic experience that truly changes lives.",10,6,8,23 May 2006
Saw II," Reasonable but not as good as the original.
","It seems like such a cliché to say it but I have to go along with the majority of other reviewers who seem to be agreed that 'Saw II' is basically not as good as the original. That still leaves a lot of scope however, given that 'Saw' was such an excellent film.It may just be that sequels never work (Godfather Part II being the exception that proves the rule!) But it is always disappointing when you have enjoyed the first one so much, to finish watching the second with a feeling of letdown.That said, Saw II is not in itself a bad film. It only really suffers in comparison to its predecessor. The pace of the sequel is good, the original premise is retained but with interesting new twists and the acting is, in general, better than average - without any one performance worthy of being singled out as excellent (with the possible exception of Tobin Bell's menacing portrayal of Jigsaw).One of the main problems here is that the script is crammed full of too many characters, and so there is little time for developing these and giving them real depth, with the result that a few of them are really fairly one-dimensional, about whom it is difficult to care too much. (This is a mistake that was very much NOT the case with the original!) Overall, it's OK. Go and see it. But just don't expect anything miraculous - and I'd certainly say that you should not see this film without seeing the original Saw first.",7,0,1,21 May 2006
Green Street Hooligans," Graphic, thought-provoking and worth seeing.
","I was encouraged to see this film by reading some of the more effusive IMDb comments. Well, it isn't as good as they led me to believe. But I certainly don't regret seeing it.If you live in the UK you know about football hooliganism. Even if (like me) you don't go to football matches, you can't avoid it. It's a part of our culture, sadly. Football is a hugely emotional game, which large parts of society take very seriously. And - when fuelled by alcohol and a trouble-making minority - this does occasionally does spill over into violence and gang warfare.It is very very very rare - and that's an important point to make to anyone overseas who may be inclined to believe the problem is worse than it is. But it happens. And the value of a film like this is to help portray that and even perhaps understand why.The more complimentary reviewers of this film all make this point, and they are right. They are also right that the film is well-made and atmospheric. The violence is shockingly realistic without being glamourised, and we see also the camaraderie and enjoyment that attracts people to being part of such gangs in the first place. We are left at the end of the film feeling we have witnessed something that must be quite close to the true experience of being part of the world portrayed.Where the film falls down is in the performances. There are some decent actors here, but none of them are allowed to shine. It is almost as if the bleak concept of the movie discourages any enjoyment of playing their roles and so squeezes out the possibility that we can truly sympathise with any of the characters.Elijah Wood is, ultimately, miscast, quite failing to achieve any basic credibility as the naive outsider drawn into this extraordinary world. And I'm not sure what Charlie Hunnam's true-life accent is, but if he isn't capable of turning in a better version of cockney than this, then it would have been far better to allow him just to use his normal voice - or get another actor. As it is, his bizarre Dick van Dyke impression is risible and distracts attention throughout from what should be the most important single role in the film.Some may feel that is a bit harsh, and other performances do their bit to make up - notably I think Leo Gregory as Bovver, the borderline psychopath who actually manages to engage emotionally at times. But the fact that the film succeeds at all is really a credit to the script, which does shine with originality and vigour, in spite of a leaden acting style from a seemingly dispirited cast.It is a bleak film, overall. There aren't many laughs here, and London has rarely looked so joy-less on screen. But then, it's a serious subject. It deserves a serious and thought-provoking treatment. And it gets that with Green Street.Go and see it. But brace yourself.",6,0,1,18 June 2006
Saw," Innovative, gripping and excellent
","This is a great film. It grabs you at the start and holds you right to the end. It's quite unlike anything you have ever seen before, and is thought-provoking as well as entertaining.One of the best things about it is Leigh Whannell, who I thought gave a great performance. The one niggle that prompts me to give it a 9 rather than a 10 is Danny Glover, I'm afraid. His portrayal of the troubled policeman lacks substance and holds the film back. But this is a minor drawback really, and the pace of the film, together with the quality of the other performances and the series of brilliant twists, easily overcomes it and holds the movie together.I'd recommend 'Saw' to anyone who enjoys good acting and a good script, built around an original and compelling idea. It's the kind of film that keeps you thinking about it long after the final credits have rolled.",9,0,1,21 May 2006
Inside Man," A well-crafted, complex heist movie
","One piece of advice has to dominate any review of this complex bank heist movie: Don't take your eyes off the screen for one second. If you do you're liable to miss something that will then leave you confused for the rest of the film. In fact, after you've seen it once you will probably want to watch it through again to check up on a couple of points. It is that kind of movie.If that puts you off seeing it, it isn't meant to. This is a good film, well-crafted and nicely directed, with some genuinely surprising twists and a decent set of performances from reliable stars like Clive Owen, Willem Defoe and Jodie Foster. It falls short of being excellent though, perhaps because the pace is allowed to sag at times. It is maybe a little longer than it needs to be. And - hard as they try - none of the actors manages to create any great sympathy for their characters. Some viewers might like that, in that it allows you to concentrate on the events of the plot. Others may feel it lacks emotional depth.But overall it's a decent film, certainly worth seeing. It's one you have to concentrate on though.",6,2,3,30 October 2007
The Terminal," Much Better Than They Say!
","For a long time I avoided this film, quite irrationally reacting against the early hype in the way we all do sometimes. Then one day I saw it on cable when there was nothing else to watch, so I gave it a go. There is a pleasant joy about being proved wrong about a film, about the wry realisation that you have been stupid enough to delay enjoying a really interesting motion picture experience.What happens is that Hanks and Spielberg do what they have done countless times before - individually and collaboratively - and draw you in. All they need is the ability to create believable characters in an interesting real-life situation and a setting we all recognise. Sounds simple. It's not. But this film plays like a masterclass in how to do it.There is a lightness of touch about the film, exemplified by the incidental music and by Hanks' winning charm as the lead character who stays relentlessly positive in the face of the kind of un-feeling bureaucratic intransigence that is designed to wear people like him down. Despite all the odds, he never doubts that he is going to get into New York City, and so neither do we. And that spirit of belief that benign destiny will prevail slowly infects not only the rest of the airport, but the audience as well. To that extent, it's a 'feel good' movie.There are some lovely individual touches too (watch out for when Viktor gets X-rayed - and then photo-copied!), and Stanley Tucci's turn as the uptight, officious airport security manager becomes a wonderful comic creation, without ever losing authenticity. But there are serious themes here too, and they are not smothered in saccharine - except perhaps in the last 20 minutes (when let's face it, it's acceptable). Spielberg's class allows the film to effortlessly dip between the tragi-serious, the laughably mundane, and OK the downright silly at times, without ever losing its pace or the logic of its simple plot.There's not much more to say about this film without spoiling it. You don't need a deep understanding of international politics to understand it, just an interest in human beings and how they behave in reaction to the situations and people around them.Watch it. You'll like it. And you'll never look at an airport terminal in quite the same way again.",8,1,2,22 May 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Hugely enjoyable
","There is very little one can say about this film that hasn't been said many times already. It exploded on to the screen as a complete surprise, and fully deserved the extraordinary level of the plaudits it received.It is not realistic, but do all films really have to be? The central character of Clarice Starling is easily recognisable as the modern career woman struggling with something to prove, played to perfection by Jodie Foster. But of course she is overshadowed by the entrancing performance of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. At once terrifying, fascinating and slightly surreal, he lurks in the mind long after the movie ends, even though his time on-screen makes up a relatively small proportion of the film, and it is worth seeing for him alone.It is hard to say that the film would have scored the success it did without this mesmerising performance. But as so often with films which are dominated by one single aspect, the fact that you are made to look closely at it reveals a number of other qualities. Tension is admirably maintained, despite the far-fetched plot, and at times it is genuinely frightening, keeping you on the edge of your seat.It's a thrilling ride; one which requires you at times to suspend your sense of reality and go where the director wants to take you. Hugely enjoyable and largely ridiculous, there is no such person as Hannibel Lecter. Or is there?",9,1,2,22 May 2006
