Skyfall," Disappointed
","What were they thinking? James Bond and M don't have like a million friends they could call upon in case of a threat? They go to the mountains and fight their war against a thug on their own??? 2 elders plus one??? I bet a figure like M, picks up the phone and orders 15 top shooters, without anyone gets news of it. Very dumb film. Also the transmitter??? It would've been obsolete in Sean Connery times. On the Chinese flea market one can buy classier products. The way it looks, the size of it... In CR they put it in his arm, that was something. Also the Macao thugs never have a gun? They go fistfight with someone and the fat-guy never checks for the Komodo dragon behind him??? ANNOYING!!! What happened with the Quantum Solace gang? They were completely forgotten of, although the score wasn't ever settled with them. Mr White just got out and disappeared. What a letdown after Casino Royal.",4,10,21,27 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Superb action
","Very good film, but TDK was far better. This year there haven't been many to name, so I recommend you to watch it, if you are tired of the disappointing stream of movies released. It's just sad to see, it wasn't dedicated to the death of Heath Ledger. Could have added a few words as To the memory of Heath Ledger. I think, he was the key to the success of the trilogy. Batman Begins was good, but the Disney train ruined it for me. TDK was excellent, witty, the writers put together a very subtle plot, with twists and turns. Nevertheless the true power of it was Heath Leger. His act put the trilogy above almost any movie. My grandkids will still appreciate his portrayal of The Joker. TDKR for me is just an action movie. Selina Kyle gives something special to it, but she's on screen for such short time. Watch it, have 3 hours of fun, nothing more.",9,3,8,4 November 2012
