Blade Runner 2049," Garbage 2049
",Long. Boring. Trash. Those are the pros. LOL seriously I don't get how so many people praise this. It's an insult to the first and it has almost nothing n common with it. Story is alright like an another poster here said but this is not blade runner and it never feels like it. I really don't like gosling's character and he just seems like an assassin. A means and nasty movie. So many things wrong with. Watch it only for the curiosity but don't expect it to be entertaining. No more please of this rubbish. Even Ridley as a director is f'n up nowadays. Every movie I watch I know what's gonna happen cuz it's all just simplistic pandering.,2,29,62,9 October 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," half a great movie
","Avengers started off REALLY great, gets a LITTLE long in the tooth after an hour and a half and wraps up with a HEAVY but at the same time rather anti-climactic ending that feels incomplete as a movie... pretty good but not GREAT. First hour was dynamite though.",7,1,4,27 April 2018
