The Hangover," The Hangover
","The Hangover has got to be one the funniest movies to come out. Between the dirty humor and the constant stupidity, it had everyone cracking up. The movie is mostly about these four guys who set out to go to Las Vegas for their buddy's bachelor party and end up losing him. They spend the whole movie looking for him, because they have no memory of what happened, hence the movie name the hangover. I mostly enjoyed this movie because it keeps people my age super entertained, and excited for the next one they come out with. In my mind there will never be a funny movie to beat this one, and there isn't one that even comes close to touching the fantastic acting played in this movie.I would recommend that everyone see this movie, once they reach the appropriate age.",Null,1,2,31 January 2011
The Notebook," The Notebook
","The Notebook is an amazing romance movie with more excitement and sadness than any movie I have ever watched. It begins with a poor boy who is trying to be with a girl who comes from a rich family. At first she isn't interested but after spending time with him she falls in love. He makes her feel free, and the people who hate this the most are her parents. When they make her move back, a huge fight causes them to break up.Years later she finds someone else and they get engaged. After seeing her first loves picture in the paper standing in front of the house she always wanted she goes back. A rush of old feelings comes back and they reunite. She is forced to decide who she wants to be with in the end.While this story is being told by an old man to the woman he loves you see that this couple is them and he tries to make her remember who she is and that she now has a family with him.The whole movie is a roller coaster of emotions and being truly in love. I love the fact that this movie shows that if something is meant to be it will happen. I was disappointed that you didn't get to see them grow old together but you can just imagine how wonderful their life was.If I could compare this movie to another one it would be Made Of Honor. In this movie the guy reacts the same as the guy in The Notebook. He realizes his love for this girl who is about to marry someone else. He does everything he can think of just to win her back and show her they were meant for each other.",10,1,2,23 January 2011
