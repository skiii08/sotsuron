The Blair Witch Project," Its all about what you don't see....
","Smash-hit independent horror film made quite an impression on the audiences of 1999 for good reason.Three student film makers go into the Maryland woods to make a documentary about a legendary witch. When they suddenly find themselves lost, they end-up becoming part of the legend themselves!Clever film is played out as a 'real' occurrence from beginning to end and frankly many viewers at the time thought it was indeed real footage shot by real missing students! Of course, it isn't, but it still went down as a landmark film of the decade. Although many people have mixed feelings about this movie, it's a unique film that pays off chillingly well for horror fans.This movie is all about mystery, atmosphere, and the unknown - all of which are themes that pay off well as the increasingly dark story unfolds. There's plenty of memorable moments to be had (the scene that pays homage to The Devil and Tom Walker is especially horrific) and it all builds to an intense climax that is truly eerie. The young stars (Donahue, Leonard, and Williams) are likable and sympathetic characters, even as their desperation drives them to anger and fear. The setting of the autumn wilderness is effectively unsettling, the old house used for the finale being particularly creepy. While some people laugh it off, which is a shame, this fan enjoys this film for it's sheer simplistic brilliance. After all it's not only one of the biggest independent films ever but quite possibly the smartest horror film of the 90's. A solid winner that deserves more respect. **** out of ****",10,9,17,10 January 2008
The Ring," Atmospheric, but senseless
","Journalist discovers that a video tape is apparently causing the death of anyone who watches it. Seriously.The Ring is a supernatural thriller that is rich with plenty of dark atmosphere and stylish direction, but it's a film that has its share of flaws as well. The biggest flaw is in the writing department, as we are given a seemly silly premise, yet it is never really explained. Logic really falls short, too short for satisfaction. Even worse the finale is over-longed in the coming, although it does have an admittedly great scare.Naomi Watts is the best of a pretty decent cast.So all around this hit thriller is worth a watch, but it's really not as good as some are writing it up to be.** 1/2 out of ****",5,0,1,20 May 2008
Dawn of the Dead," Action-filled remake isn't half bad.
","Remake of Romero's classic Dawn of the Dead (1978) is pretty good, even though it mostly steers away from the original film.Zombies are running amok, which leaves a number of people trapped inside a shopping mall, but how long will they be able to live there?Dawn of the Dead 2004 basically only keeps the premise of the original film, building a new plot with a larger number of new characters, and with the help of director Zack Snyder it becomes an entertaining flick. The film is packed with action, some new suspenseful situations, and some nicely done humor. This remake is all the more intense because it doesn't use the typical 'zombie' image, but rather re-invents the flesh-eaters as more cunning creatures, after all they do run in this film! There's also plenty of freakishly good make up FX to be had and a great rock soundtrack.The cast is pretty good, Polley, Rhames, Weber, Kelly, Booth, and Zegers being especially good characters.Dawn of the Dead 2004 remains the most critically acclaimed horror remake thus far, and it's not hard to see why.*** out of ****",8,1,1,4 January 2006
Hostel," Nerve-grinding HORROR!
","Director Eli Roth returns to the horror scene with this horrifically shocking and daring film that makes Roth's earlier film, the outrageous Cabin Fever (2003), look like a light-weight thriller! Two American students traveling across Europe fall into the clutches of a sadistic madman and his colleagues who make a business out of violently torturing people.Completely merciless in its brutality and tension, Hostel is Roth's most mature film thus far. Roth's story is well-written with a great set-up and a plot that builds suspense and spirals into madness and extreme violence. To say it's a film that's gripping and edgy is a real understatement! The gore FX are as bloody as can be, producing plenty of truly disturbing (if not downright sickening) images. I couldn't imagine what would have been cut from this film to get an R rating. This is what we horror fans have come to expect from Eli Roth though, and he more than delivers the horrific goods in this film, he pushes the envelope plenty. Roth also adds a strong sense of the erotic, adding lots of nudity. All the while, Roth does excellent direction with great locations, atmosphere, and well-done intensity. Kudos also go to the great soundtrack of European rock songs.The cast is perfectly good, and often rather bold. The best of them are Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson as the ill-fated American youths.Once again Eli Roth has delivered excellent old-school horror that pulls out all the stops and gives us horror fans the strong stuff that we need! For the hard-core horror fans only.*** 1/2 out of ****",10,13,25,6 January 2006
The Others," A beautiful and atmospheric chiller.
","Hit chiller from the summer of 2001 is a terrifically twisted and beautifully made ghost flick that recalls the old-fashion spookiness of The Haunting (1963).Woman living in isolation with her two young children begins to believe that they are not alone in their huge, dark house.Alejandro Amenaber delivers an intriguing and compelling story, full of mystery, suspense, jolts, and capped with one mind-blowing twist. It's a fully gripping thriller with some likable and well-fleshed out characters. The direction of Amenaber is wonderfully atmospheric and done with a nice touch of subtly that builds tension even higher. The musical score is nicely moody too.Nicole Kidman does an excellent performance, as does young Alakina Mann and James Bentley as her children. Fionnula Flanagan is also good as a mysterious housekeeper.Over all, The Others is a superior supernatural thriller that is unforgettably good.**** out of ****",10,2,5,20 May 2008
Fargo," A true modern classic!
","One of the greatest films of the 90's was this beautifully quirky and darkly suspenseful thriller from Joel and Ethan Coen.Minnistota man hires some thugs to fake a kidnapping with his wife, but the foolish team quickly fouls things up and a small-town policewoman is about to uncover the crime.Recalling a lot of the elements of the Coen's debut thriller Blood Simple (1984), Fargo also proves to be a unique and smartly told drama/thriller. The story is more complex this time, with an even larger band of colorful (and often dim-witted) characters. Fargo is one of those rare films that has a little bit of every film genre in its story. You have film noir, slick comedy, suspense-thriller, parody, and even small-town drama all weaved into one terrifically amusing gem of a film. The direction is wonderfully well-done, as is the beautifully atmospheric music score.The cast of this film is excellent. Frances McDormand is perfectly lovable as the films rather unlikely heroine, a pregnant small-town cop. William H. Macy is subtly funny as the films desperate conspirator. Steve Buscemi is a stand out as one of the idiot kidnappers. The rest of the cast is also solidly good!A masterpiece of a movie, probably the Coen's best, that's a true must-see for all film fans!**** out of ****",10,0,0,8 July 2006
The Thing," You couldn't ask for better sci-fi horror!
","Another well-loved horror masterpiece from director John Carpenter is this unforgettable re-imagining of the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing From Another World. Scientists stationed at an outpost on the South Pole are terrorized by a mysterious shape-shifting alien.Themes of paranoia, the unknown, and isolation are very common in the horror/scifi genre and they are well utilized in this film. John Carpenter directs this film with gusto, giving it a terrificly haunting and bleak atmosphere. Ennio Morricone adds all the more to the atmospheric spookiness with his eerie music score. However, the best highlight of The Thing is undoubtedly the awesome special FX of Rob Bottin. Even by today's standards of CGI visual FX, the creature creations of Bottin are truly outstanding. This film was made nearly 25 years ago and still the creepy alien FX of The Thing manage to shock and thrill! An impressive feat indeed.Another highlight is the great cast of the film, the best of which is hero Kurt Russell in one of his most challenging roles.All around, The Thing is a stunning combination of moody atmosphere and out-of-this-world horrors. It remains as one of Carpenter's best films and stands as one of the greatest alien-horror films out there! **** out of ****",10,16,20,14 January 2006
The Village," Apparently the critics can't stand a plot twist.
","Highly underrated thriller is one of M. Night Shyamalan's greatest films yet, and certainly doesn't disappoint his fans!Pennsylvania village is held in isolation by it's surrounding woods that harbor mythical monsters! Beautifully directed, greatly acted, and has a story full of mystery, suspense, and mind-blowing twists. M. Night Shyamalan is a master at using an audience's expectations to create original and surprising thrillers and The Village is perhaps his most clever turn as a writer. His direction is great as always, capturing some gorgeous imagery in the old-settlers village and in the wooded wilderness. He also creates a terrific atmosphere of wonder and some tight suspense scenes. James Newton Howard returns to score this picture, he previously worked on Shyamalan's Signs (2002), and delivers another elegant piece here.The cast is top-notch. Rising star Bryce Dallas Howard proves not only to be a lovely girl but a captivating actress as well. Joaquin Phoenix does a strong performance with his silent character. Adrian Brody does well as the village idiot. Veteran actors William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver turn in good performances as always.Don't listen to the critics on this film, The Village is one of the most surprising thrillers ever! *** 1/2 out of ****",10,2,5,2 January 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," A full-blooded horror ride, Aja does it again!
","Remake of Wes Craven's 1977 horror classic proves to be a top-notch shocker that's fast-paced and never lets up on its sharp edginess!Family traveling to California breaks down in the New Mexico desert where a band of savage mutants threatens to kill them all.The Hills Have Eyes 2006 is an excellent and fairly faithful remake that works because it manages to retain the same merciless terror that made the original unforgettable. Director Alexandre Aja (who gave us the ultra-creepy High Tension last year) lends some slick style to the movie, but more importantly knows how to drive suspense and gruesome shocks to effectively horrific extremes! As violent and harrowing as the original film was, this remake is even more so. At times the movie is far more nightmarish than the Wes Craven film. The boys at KNB FX provide some truly gory blood-letting and some terrifying makeup work on the villains. There's also great filming locations, excellent set work, and a moody music score to boot.The cast is a strong highlight of the film. Aaron Stanford rises to his role well as a desperate father. Dan Byrd is great as a young victim. Vinessa Shaw does an emotional turn as an ill-fated young woman. Kathleen Quinlan and Ted Lavine are both strong as the parents of the family. Emilie de Ravin is also quite effective as a traumatized young woman.An outstanding remake period, it's easily one of the best in this old-school horror remake cycle! Fans of the horror genre should check it out and the faint of heart (and weak of stomach) should avoid.**** out of ****",10,2,6,10 March 2006
28 Days Later...," One of the best end-of-mankind movies out there!
","Excellent apocalyptic thriller is a finely made and ever-engrossing film.Young British man awakens from a coma to discover that a virus has cause the destruction of the country and it's every man for himself!Truly well-crafted movie is actually much better than the 'zombie film' label that everyone seems to slap on it. While there are zombies in this motion picture it's really not about them, it's about our little band of surviving human characters. In a sense it's Boyle's version of Romero's classic Dawn of the Dead (1978), which is just one of the many films that 28 Days Later... takes inspiration from, but this movie is just too good to be seen as a rip-off of anything! Writer Alex Garland gives us an intriguing and thrilling tale of human survival and survival of the human spirit. Director Danny Boyle give us plenty of terrific action sequences and a great atmospheric fear as well. The cinematography is stylishly good.The cast is awesome. Rising star Cillian Murphy is truly likable as our sympathetic leading man. Naomie Harris gives a strong performance as a woman fighting to stay alive. Supporting performances from Gleeson, Burns, Eccleston and the rest of the cast are excellent as well. The film boast some splendid, and bloody, special effects. The rock soundtrack provides for wonderfully operatic themes.A great film on all levels, 28 Days Later... is one of the best films of its kind.**** out of ****",10,4,7,22 December 2005
The Mist," A bold and powerful horror film, a must for King fans!
","Over the years Stephen King's shorter works (his short stories and novellas) haven't always made for the best big screen adaptations. Recently however King's works have been done some good justice (this year's 1408 being a fine addition) and now this stunning film version of King's novella The Mist, which may just be the best and brightest King-based film in many a day.Following a violent storm, several residence of a small Maine town head off to the local grocery market where they find themselves trapped by a massive cloud of mist. As fear and paranoid grow among the locals it soon becomes evident that monstrous creatures lurk outside, but that's not the only threat. The Mist is one fantastic tale of unknown terrors and human evil. Director-screen writer Frank Darabont does an excellent job of capturing the chilling effectiveness of the novella. Not only is the film pretty faithful to the original story, it also adds some effective elements of it's own, such as a jaw dropping conclusion to what was originally an open-ended story. The creature FX are gruesomely well done, the suspense and claustrophobia are quite intense, and Darabont's documentary-type camera work makes the film all the more realistic. There's also some great doses of sweat-inducing action to be had. Adding even more to the story are the well-drawn and heart felt characters, which make the film's bold climax all the more powerful.The cast is quite good. Thomas Jane is endearing as our unfortunate hero, Marcia Gay Harden is a chilling villain as the religious fanatic, and Laurie Holden is solid as a new-comer to town. Toby Jones, William Sadler, Frances Sternhagen, and young Nathan Gamble round out a great supporting cast.All around The Mist is a fine horror film. It isn't a schlocky, clichéd, or pretentious popcorn scare fest, but an intelligent and deadly serious journey that possesses far more than just gore and shock. It has genuine depth and that alone puts it above most modern genre movies.**** out of ****",10,5,11,6 March 2009
The Elephant Man," One of the most beautifully moving dramas of modern cinema.
","A modern masterpiece of style, grace, and thoughtful film-making; The Elephant Man is one of David Lynch's finest works.In Victorian England, a doctor discovers a terribly deformed gentleman being used as a side-show freak and takes in him hoping to give him a decent life in society.The Elephant Man is one of those rare films that actually reaches an emotional level with its viewer. Lynch makes this film with a truly dark and even bleak atmosphere, but this atmosphere gives birth to a kind of hope only the human heart could produce. Its sounds weird to describe a Lynch film in this way, but The Elephant Man differs from the stories of some of Lynch's more terrifying thrillers. Director Lynch does give this film some of his trademark surrealism, as well as some nicely hypnotic sequences. The style of this film is lavish, even as it's filmed in black and white. John Hurt's makeup work is astonishingly convincing. The music score of John Morris is beautiful and haunting at the same time. The conclusion of this film is one of the most elegant and solemn of cinematic history.The great Anthony Hopkins is terrific as always as the doctor that wishes to save the title character. John Hurt, even under a ton of makeup, is excellent as the films sympathetic and tender-hearted subject. The late Anne Bancroft appears as a theater actress who becomes friend to John Hurt's character.A magnificent film, quite unlike any other, The Elephant Man is a must see for all cinema lovers - the tender hearted of which will likely need tissues before the movie ends. For once, that's a good thing!**** out of ****",10,0,0,7 February 2006
The Evil Dead," The horror genre's greatest roller-coaster ride!!
","Inventive, startling, and always-packing energy, Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead is a true testament to the power of talent over budget! It has became a beloved cult classic and stands as one of the most influential horror films of all time!Five young adults go off to a mountain cabin, where they unknowingly unleash evil, possessive spirits that reek havoc upon everything!The Evil Dead is perhaps the last of the great drive-in horror classics. Director Sam Raimi, who has since gone on to films with much bigger budgets, made his debut with this wildly terrifying genre masterpiece. Raimi's crafty direction builds a thick atmosphere of dread and isolation through out the film, using the woodsy setting as a great back drop. He uses some nicely inventive camera shots. The movie does indeed play out like shocking roller-coaster ride, as the scenes of in-your-face horror and gore hit hard and fast, only to be followed by eerie lulls of tension. It's the most effectively gripping style that any horror film could use! Raimi also makes the most out of using dark humor in the film, making even the most scary sequences strangely funny. The makeup FX are truly gruesome, even with a low-budget there are plenty of freakishly-good FX to drive the thrills.Raimi also creates some nicely bizarre and memorable sequences, like the vine-rape scene with Cheryl, the demented singing of a possessed Linda, the 'bleeding' cellar pipes, and that grand finale with Ash having to make a stand to survive! Not to mention the knock-out final shot of the film, which is probably the greatest closing image to any horror picture ever! Also worthy of mention is the great music score by Joe LoDuca. LoDuca's music is a perfect match to the film, building plenty of tension and playing off the shocks very well.The cast is as good as one would expect from a B picture, but they do hold their own. Of course the real star of the show is square-jawed B movie hero Bruce Campbell. Bruce does an outstanding role, playing terror to a T, and enduring the physical hardships of a grueling low-budget film. He deserves his B movie king status!The Evil Dead has gone on to become one of the biggest cult films of all time and it's not hard to see why either! It's an outstandingly awesome horror ride that should be taken by all horror film fans! If they're anything like this horror fan, Evil Dead will quickly become a big favorite!Followed by Raimi's comical Evil Dead II (1987) and Army of Darkness (1993)**** out of **** (horror perfection)",10,8,12,2 January 2006
Saw II," A sequel that won't disappoint
","Sequel to the hit horror film Saw (2004), is a pretty tight well-done thriller itself.The Jigsaw killer is still at work, this time capturing a group of folks inside a house where they will soon die if they don't play the game!As with the original, Saw II is a solidly written, gory, suspenseful ride, but it wisely doesn't try to mirror the original film. Right from the beginning the film takes an unexpected turn, to become a more compellingly twisted thriller. It has plenty of cringe-worthy, gruesome scenes. Also like the original, the plot here builds to some great intensity and is topped off with another great surprise ending.Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, Tobin Bell, and young Erik Knudsen turn in great performances.A good sequel all around, that won't disappoint the fans!*** out of ****",8,2,4,7 August 2006
Saw," ' so I saw Saw last night...'
","Clever, highly intense horror-thriller is one of the most intelligently done killer thrillers in years.Two men awaken to discover that they are chained inside a dilapidated old restroom, having fallen into the hands of a murderer who likes to play deadly games with his victims.Well-written and tightly directed, Saw is a truly dark and nerve-grinding kind of suspense thriller. From it's mysterious opening to it's twisted, shocking finale it is a high-powered shocker that's sure to draw in any viewer. It packs plenty of chilling sequences, eerie atmosphere, and references to some old-school horror films.The cast isn't bad. Cary Elwes does a good performance as a trapped doctor who is desperate to save his family from the madman. Leigh Whannell (who co-wrote the film) is great as a photographer who's also caught up in the madness. Veteran actor Danny Glover is perfect as a police detective determined to find the killer.An unforgettable horror film all around, Saw is not to be missed.*** 1/2 out of ****",9,3,7,2 January 2006
The Descent," An absolutely bloodcurdling terror film.
","Director Neil Marshall (who gave us the smashing werewolf movie Dog Soldiers in 2002) returns to the horror scene with an even more intense and horrific adventure.In the North Carolina mountains a band of girlfriends are exploring underground caverns and learn that they are not alone in the black depths of the unknown.The Descent is a fine horror film that has quite a lot of good things going for it, but one thing above all makes this an excellent horror outing - it delivers genuine fear! Frankly, it had the audience I was viewing it with screaming on a number of occasions! Unfortunately, I can't say the same for most horror movies I watch in the theaters.Marshall's story is one that builds extreme tension, even from its opening scenes. It builds to terrifically intense action and plenty of bloody violence. All of this is capped off with a surprisingly twisted finale. Even more effectively disturbing is just how claustrophobic this movie is! The setting is dark and tight, leaving the audience in just as much unsettling blackness as the characters in the film. This adds up to some solidly jolting scares. The cinematography is stylishly well-done, the filming locations are beautiful, and the special 'creature' FX are gruesomely good. Oh yes, and there's lots of bloodiness to be had for all you gore hounds!The cast is quite good as well. Shauna Macdonald is perhaps the best of the cast, as a young woman who lost her child in a tragic car wreck and now must fight to save her friends.The Descent is a movie that I almost didn't see, but thankfully after reading some strong reviews for it I did. Believe me, I am one happy horror fan for having done so! The Descent will undoubtedly go down as one of the best horror films of the year!**** out of ****",10,19,35,4 August 2006
The Happening," Mr. Shyamalan or How I Learned to Start Worrying and Love the Plants.
","When mysterious force starts causing mass suicides in the cities, a school teacher and his friends flee to the country where they must fight to survive this deadly unknown phenomena.I've been a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan since Signs and I was one of maybe five people who actually liked The Village. Lady in the Water.... well that is another story. Anyhow I was still eager to see this latest work by Shyamalan and it truly did leave an impression on me. That impression was that he will likely never make another big-budgeted Hollywood film again. Sad, but true. The Happening is a very campy kind of disaster film. It has an intriguing premise but it's really muddled down by it's hammy dialog, lack of suspense, and performances that are just bizarre. Seriously, was Shyamalan's direction to Zooey Deschanel to act as if she were stoned through out the entire movie? Even the wonderful Mark Wahlberg is more awkward than anything else in this film. I know it's a poor film, yet...I found myself genuinely entertained by it. In a campy kind of way this movie did amuse me. It was funny at times, though unintentionally so, and even as the film didn't have the suspense or scares that I had hoped for it had enough action to keep it afloat. It was weird and off-beat and in the end I think it was the pure strangeness of it that saved it from being a bore.So what's my final verdict? Well, it's a tough call. I found it interesting and never dull, but I'm also the first to admit that it was pretty flawed. I say if you're a die-hard Shyamalan fan, go see it, if not I would do some internet investigating before seeing it. Either way, I think the time of M. Night Shyamalan has ended.** 1/2 out of ****",6,3,6,6 March 2009
Zombieland," A delightful comic riot from beginning to end!
","A young man must cope with life in the midst of a zombie apocalypse as he joins a tough redneck and two sisters in a fight for survival, romance, and twinkees.The zombie genre has always seemed to make for the best horror-comedies. There's Return of the Living Dead (1985), Dead Alive (1992), and Shaun of the Dead (2004), just to name a few; now we have a little gem called Zombieland and it certainly lives up to all the previous 'zom com's'. Zombieland is a terrifically fun film. It has lightning-fast pacing, hard-hitting action, and a fantastically colorful sense of humor. This is one excellently well-written comedy that packs genuinely effective laughs into nearly every scene - which is a feat in itself. The dialog is often hilarious and the comic gags are clever. The characters are endearing and very likable. The direction is quite good and there's plenty of gruesome zombie chaos for genre fans to enjoy.The cast is great. Jesse Eisenberg is a joy as the wimp-turned-lovesick-hero. Woody Harrelson has never played a more colorful character and he's a complete hoot. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are solid as the two sisters. Bill Murray is a welcomed sight as he makes an uproariously funny cameo - playing himself no less.Zombieland is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in ages. It's a comedy that more than delivers on what it promises and becomes a superior horror-comedy that's not just for zombie fans. It is destined to be a cult classic. See it!**** out of ****",10,15,32,4 October 2009
Army of Darkness," Should have been called The Midevil Dead!
","Sam Raimi's third entry in the Evil Dead series is this cool combination of his wild humor and action.After the chaos of Evil Dead II, Ash has been hurled back into the dark ages where he must once again battle the evil dead as a knight.Perhaps the most hilariously over-the-top of Raimi's horror comedies, Army of Darkness is a truly unique and ever-entertaining oddity. Raimi keeps to his beloved slap-stick comedy through out the film, giving us plenty of gruesomeness and laughs to go with it! There's lots of well-directed action and inventive camera work to keep the excitement high. The special FX are fairly well-done, such memorable creations as the 'split' personality of Ash, the aggressive necronomicon, and the army of skeletons.Bruce Campbell returns as Ash, and shows off his heroic macho side, while he does plenty of the great physical comedy. The attack of the 'little Ashes' is especially funny.As with Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness is another weird, yet truly fun laugh riot that must be seen!*** 1/2 out of ****",10,4,6,6 January 2006
Scream 2," Second entry is a solid follow-up!
","Wes Craven's Scream started a whole new slew of slasher flicks in the late '90's, it's own sequel is actually one of the best!Sidney Prescott is now off at college, but it seems like history is about to repeat itself big time!Scream 2 turned out to be a much stronger sequel than the average follow-up. Director Craven and writer Kevin Williamson proved that lightning does strike twice as they managed to turn out a sequel that was almost as fun as the original. As with the original, Scream 2 is an intense shocker, full of suspense, humor, and talent. Again, like the original, the story builds to a wonderfully twisted finale! Helping all the more Campbell, Arquette, Kennedy, and Cox make welcomed returns as their original characters.All around Scream 2 is as good a sequel as anyone could have hoped for!*** 1/2 out of ****",9,0,0,22 December 2005
Scream," Probably the best horror film of its decade.
","Great, block-buster horror film that re-introduced the genre into Hollywood and stands out as one of Wes Craven's best films! In Woodsboro, California, a young high school girl is still having to deal with the mysterious murder of her mother a year before, while it seems that someone is taking their love for horror films way too far!!Gripping and entertaining from its shocking opening sequence to its nail-biting finale, Scream is probably the finest horror film of its day. Screen writer Kevin Williamson hit it off with his terrific screen play for this film, which pokes fun at the slasher conventions all the while that it draws us into a thrilling and suspenseful story. Horror master Craven shows he's not lost touch with his horror roots as this film comes off in a very terrifying manner. Kudos also go to a great score and soundtrack.The cast is first-rate. Neve Campbell is touching and sympathetic as our leading character. David Arquette is humorous as an unlikely hero, police officer. Courtney Cox is perfect as a snappy reporter looking to solve a murder. While Ulrich, McGowan, Lillard, and Kennedy make for awesome teens and suspects!A truly smashing horror film, that would be followed by two pretty decent sequels and a number of knock-offs. Not to mention being the basis for the crazy Scary Movie spoofs. Scream is a movie that's not to be missed by fans of the genre!**** out of ****",10,1,2,2 October 2005
Halloween," THE staple of modern horror!
","Classic, highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director Carpenter and star Curtis.Seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on Halloween.Halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! Carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt! The direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors, that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy. Carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling, that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage! Plus, he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong. Highest kudos also go to Carpenter's simple, yet frighteningly unnerving music score. In a sense, Halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film!The cast is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter Laurie Strode, she's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films. The great Donald Pleasants does a perfect performance as a Myer's doctor, who's desperate to capture him again. Supporting cast Loomis, Soles, Castle, and others are good too.So like its own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill. It is a MUST for all genre fans!**** out of ****",10,16,23,23 December 2005
Carrie," A thoughtful and engulfing classic!
","Excellent big screen version of author Stephen King's first novel is not only a suspenseful teen drama, but a touching character study too.Social misfit spends her days mocked by her classmates and harassed by her fanatically religious mother, then she discovers that she has the power of telekinesis...Director Brian De Palma made a number of top-notch suspense thrillers during the 70's and Carrie is surely one of his finest works. The story of this film is a compelling one because you not only feel sorry for the teen misfit of the title, but you also want her to find happiness. It all builds into a powerful drama that packs lots of thrills, occasional humor, and strong emotional tones. De Palma lends his usual stylish direction, drawing out the suspense and at times making the movie quite hypnotic with some inventive camera work. The lovely music score of Pino Donaggio is also a nice touch.Perhaps the best thing about this film though is the wonderful cast! Sissy Spacek does a touching portrayal as our title character, who turns to become quite frightening in the climatic prom scene. Piper Laurie is a powerhouse actress in the role of Spacek's crazed mother. Amy Irving is likable as the teen girl who wants to help the outcast. William Katt is strong as the hip jock who becomes one unlucky prom date. Supporting cast Nancy Allen, John Travolta, and Betty Buckley also turn in good performances.Carrie is a classic that should be appreciated by all film lovers, not just those that enjoy the horror genre. It's a must-see.**** out of ****",10,4,7,26 July 2006
1408," As effectively chilling as the story it's based on.
","Wildly twisted psychological thriller, based upon the Stephen King short story, is a stylish and eerie ride into the supernatural.Freelance author of ghost books decides to stay in an infamous 'haunted' hotel room with horrific results.When it comes to the writings of Stephen King and the big screen, the films don't always manage to retain the powerful atmosphere and tension of their source material. 1408 however is a pleasant exception. With a simple, yet engrossing promise it plows through its viewer with a roller-coaster of frights and emotional depth. The direction is nicely done, the music score atmospheric, and the sets and special FX are well crafted.John Cusack is great as the troubled dis-believing writer and Samuel L. Jackson is also good as the hotel manager.Over all 1408 is a must for King fans and a terrific treat for horror fans who think that a PG-13 rating means 'bad news'.*** 1/2 out of ****",9,2,4,23 June 2007
Signs," The best thriller of 2002 and Shyamalan's masterpiece!
","Terrific in every way, M. Night Shyamalan's Signs is one of the most thought provoking thrillers of our time and Shyamalan's greatest work!When a Pennsylvania family discovers crop circles (among other weird occurrences) on their farm, they begin to believe that Earth is about to have some hostile visitors from above!With Shyamalan's stylish direction, an excellent cast, and an engulfing story that's both suspenseful and touching, Signs becomes one of the most beautifully done thrillers in many ages. Shyamalan is at his best as he captures the power of his intriguing tale both cinematically and emotionally well. He gives us a story with lovable, sympathetic characters who come into an extraordinary and terrifying situation, needless to say it's a captivating story from start to finish. It also possesses lots of color, as Shyamalan throws in plenty of tension, thrills, humor, and deeply stirring scenes. James Newton Howard provides a lovely music score for the film that is scene-by-scene perfect.The cast is a true highlight as well. The always-excellent Mel Gibson is strong as a reverend who is losing his faith following the loss of his wife. Joaquin Phoenix does well as Gibson's bewildered brother. Young Rory Culkin is great as Gibson's son and adorable Abigail Breslin is splendid as the daughter.A truly wonderful film on all levels, Signs is a film that will be enjoyed by all, not just fans of thriller genre. Even those who don't care for Shyamalan's earlier pictures may be surprised by this gem. It's well worth seeing more than once!**** out of ****",10,2,6,29 June 2006
Identity," Clever, but almost too clever
","A group of strangers end up stranded at a motel, sinister events unfold, but is all as it seems?Identity is one of those thrillers that could have been really great, if it were not so over-done. The setup of the film is pretty good and for the most part, this is a decent thriller. But it is the finale that really lets the film fall short. After some good twists, one is pretty satisfied with the film, but when the movie begins to keep throwing in twists and over-longs the ending, it gets a little too tiresome. A similar flaw can be found in The Ring. But, this is my only real problem with the movie.This film has good quality and a slick sense of style. The cast is also in good form. Over all, it might just be a treat for fans of the twisted thriller. Give it a whirl.** 1/2 out of ****",5,4,9,25 October 2004
The Sixth Sense," A moving shocker.
","Big-hit chiller was the film that brought director Shyamalan to fame and started a new wave of supernatural thrillers.Philedelphia psychiatrist meets a troubled young boy who has the ability to see ghosts.Thoughtful, suspenseful, and strongly-written; it's not hard to see how this film hit it off with both audiences and critics. Shyamalan delivers a story with some likable, well-drawn characters. There's some occasional good (and gruesome) shocks that keep the tension edgy and the plot builds to a startling twist ending. Shyamalan's direction is slick with lots of dark atmosphere and creepy imagery.The films stars are another strong feature. Bruce Willis is captivating as the psychiatrist, but it's really young Haley Joel Osmond that steals the show as our cursed young hero.One of the best supernatural thrillers of its day.*** 1/2 out of ****",9,1,1,31 January 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Horror's favorite neighborhood!
","The 80's biggest horror landmark was this smash-hit that brought director Craven into mainstream film and gave birth to an unstoppable horror icon!Young lady discovers that she and her friends are having the same terrifying dreams about a scar-faced maniac, who's about to transcend into murderous life!Wes Craven's biggest claim to fame, A Nightmare on Elm Street was a far more imaginative slasher film than the numerous others that flooded the 80's cinema scene. Craven's clever premise and inventively shocking story added a kind of dark fantasy element that made this film so much more engrossing (and frightening) than the average slasher flick. It also turned villain Freddy Kruger into the biggest horror icon since the monsters of 50's horror cinema. Craven's direction is truly great, giving this film plenty of feverish atmosphere, tight suspense, and a share of good scares! Adding even more to the movie is the occasional touch of dark humor, who could ever forget that 'tounge phone' bit. The movie also has lots of gruesome special FX as well. The Elm Street theme by Charles Bernstein is a nicely chilling touch too.The cast is quite good. Heather Langenkamp makes for a terrific and likable heroine. John Saxon and Ronee Blakley are both great as Langenkamp's disbelieving parents. Amanda Wyss, Nick Corri, and Johnny Depp (in his debut role) are also great as some troubled Elm Street youths. Robert Englund is a power-house villain as Freddy Kruger.A modern horror classic all the way, A Nightmare on Elm Street is still making folks afraid to sleep all these years later!Followed by numerous sequels.**** out of ****",10,18,20,21 January 2006
Evil Dead II," an insane, wicked, and utterly hilarious sequel!!
","Sam Raimi's bigger budgeted follow up to his horror masterpiece The Evil Dead (1981) is one of the greatest horror-comedies of all time!After a brief re-enactment of the first film, Ash is once again stuck in that possessed cabin as those pesky evil spirits run wild!Evil Dead II mixes horror and comedy as no other film ever has. It's a wonderfully over-the-top ride from beginning to end, like the original Evil Dead the sequel plays out like a relentless high-speed roaster coaster ride. Raimi's touches of horror are gory and shockingly good, while his moments of slap-stick humor are outrageously funny. The special makeup FX are effectively freakish whether they make you laugh or scream!Bruce Campbell returns as our terrorized hero Ash. Campbell does a tremendously funny performance as he is a champion of physical-comedy! The part in which his hand becomes possessed is especially memorable.A wickedly fun horror-comedy all the way, Evil Dead II ranks among Raimi and Campbell's greatest work.*** 1/2 out of ****",10,2,3,6 January 2006
