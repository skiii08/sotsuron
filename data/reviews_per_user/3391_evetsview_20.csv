The Incredible Hulk," Big Green Guy done right this time
","When I discovered a new take on the Hulk was coming out, after being painfully disappointed with the Ang Lee version, I hoped for a redeeming treatment of the material. The Hulk is one of Marvels' most enjoyable characters. This version exceeds the other by far. Its much more like the characters and story I remember from the comic book and doesn't take the story in a direction that leaves you scratching your head.This version is closely tied to the TV series back in the 70's and doesn't try to hide it - the same gamma-ray experiment gone wrong and the same honorable Bruce Banner, forever on the move because he is a danger to all, especially the one's he loves. Edward Norton was very convincing in the role of Banner and just seems to come off more like the character I remember from the comic book. He is certainly more likable and more easily identifiable.There's no wasted minutes explaining the entire back-story - the opening credits depicted in a montage of clips essentially take care of that detail and much is assumed that the audience is at least somewhat familiar with the character or the TV series. The action scenes are very well done and the final fight scene where the Hulk squares off against the monstrosity known as the 'Abomination' is very exciting.The supporting cast does a commendable job - William Hurt as Gen. Ross and Liv Tyler as Betty do their characters justice - Tim Roth always brings intensity to his roles and this one is no exception, his character Blonsky is supplied by General Ross with an amped-up steroid cocktail known as 'super soldier serum' and from then on - the intensity is taken up a few notches to say the least - its definitely there as evidenced by one of his lines - after he has confronted and battled the Hulk twice he is asked by the General - how he feels after recuperating from an almost fatal rumble with the green behemoth 'How do you feel?' Blonsky answers 'Pissed off...and ready for round three.'I'm personally disappointed that Edward Norton will not return to reprise his role in the upcoming 'Avengers' after handling the role so well in this movie, but I'm guessing that we'll be seeing much more screen time with the Big Green Guy in that film anyway. It will be interesting to see how the Hulk character will be involved in that project.",Null,1,2,11 May 2011
Iron Man 2," Good Action - but overall - very lacking
","Everything that made the first Iron Man film so good is attempted in this sequel but for the most part, falls short - the film looks lazy - as if it is simply living off the first film's success.Despite this the film still has merit. I particularly liked the part of the story that included the Howard Stark flashback and that tie-in to the story. Robert Downey Jr. is still good in most of his scenes - especially the quiet, calm moments where he is in a way being re-introduced to his late father - these scenes are good - but the scene where he is intoxicated and entertaining a bunch of party animals is ridiculous and no doubt, rolled several pairs of eyes in the cinema, including mine. Anyone who read the Iron Man stories, knows full well that Tony Stark had his inner-demons and had a drinking problem for a while but this part of the character could have been handled in a much more effective way in the film. The Pepper Potts character is already getting stale. Nick Fury scenes are intriguing but pretty much just set up material for the up-coming Avengers movie and though the post credits cameo of a certain thunder god's hammer found in the NM desert tantalizes the Marvelites, so many of the performances simply looked uninspired.The film is still entertaining and the action scenes do not disappoint - especially the scene at the race track involving Whiplash and the final scene where Iron Man and War Machine are facing off against the deadly drones. Scarlett Johannson did a commendable job as Black Widow her scenes are good but they are rushed - hope to see more of this character's development in The Avengers movie. The Justin Hammer character brought a few laughs as well as Happy Hogan, but if there is to be another Iron Man film - they need to inject it with the same elements that made the first film such a hit and then take it to the next level as we saw in X-Men 2.",Null,3,8,8 July 2011
Spider-Man 2," Even better than the first Spider Man
","Having been a long time fan of Spider Man, I can't help but feel connected to this series. Seeing the web-slinger up on the big screen was a day dream that I indulged in as a kid often enough while reading the comic books. I was thrilled with the first Spider Man film and after seeing this second installment, I'm pleased to say, I'm convinced the Spider Man movies are in good hands.Spider Man 2 takes the familiar characters and moves them forward in their aspirations and their troubles. This was why Marvel Comics have been so successful over the last thirty years - because they put so much of these human elements in their stories. Alfred Molina joins the group this time as Dr. Octopus. I have enjoyed Molina's work for a number of years now (mostly British productions) and was glad to see him slated to play Doc Oc. Tobey Maguire instills in the character of Peter Parker very convincingly, the very issues that someone thrust into such a destiny would be faced with, he's just a college kid and still going through the rigors of growing up. I love the scene where he has saved the people on the run-away train from certain destruction and passes out, lying on the floor of the train without his mask, when a bystander says with a tone of astonishment - 'He's only a kid.' Excellent touch.This film is not without its flaws - but very few. The scene where Spidey confronts Doc Oc and tells him that he has to destroy his invention for the sake of saving the city and its people, and the Doc simply replies - 'Yeah, you're right.' is a stretch to say the least (I don't remember Doc Oc necessarily being that compassionate in the comic book - and he always came back to wreak more havoc) But I won't knock the whole film because of this scene - its too well done in all the other areas. The effects are better and the fight scenes exciting and the tension between Peter and Harry grows. And even the Aunt May character continues to develop well in dealing with the loss of her husband. And I can't forget Kirsten Dunst as MJ who struggles with her feelings for Peter - her last line - 'Go get'em Tiger is perfect for the set-up for the next film and is a line right out of the comic book. The visuals are the real appeal of this movie but the characters are believable and you identify with them immediately. Can't wait for Spider Man 3.",Null,0,0,29 March 2007
Spider-Man 3," Interesting Twist in the Web
","Spider Man 3 takes some different twists and turns. We pick up where we left off from Spider Man 2 where Peter and MJ have decided to give in to their true feelings and take the risks that will no doubt put a great deal of strain on their relationship. We also see the tension still mounting between Peter and Harry. However instead of continuing on the predictable course of a series of scenes with MJ being put in constant peril and Spidey coming to the rescue in the nick of time, we see a much more personal, human culprit begin to undermine the relationship - fame and ego and career struggles and disappointments. All these things are handled in a believable manner but Spider Man 3 suffers from the old case of trying to cram too much into one film in order to top the previous film.The Sandman character was predictable and boring and the film would have been better off without it. The special effects are very good but the character had very little depth and took up more screen time which could have been put to better use with the Eddie Brock character and the development of Venom. I'm not sure why the film felt it had to put in more story that had to touch on the death of Uncle Ben again, by this time its growing tiresome. The developing triangle that occurs between Peter MJ and Harry is dramatic and well-paced. Sadly the mysterious dark suit that falls from the sky is given no explanation at all. (Unless Venom will make a return in future films and this detail will be thought out a little better).There's more humor in this movie and it keeps the action from getting over the top - the scenes involving Jonah Jameson and (Bruce Campbell) as the french matre 'd stand out. The scenes where we see the darker side of Peter caused by the suit is well done and his other scenes played for humor were enjoyable. However by the last part of the film the dialogue begins to get very weak - The reporter covering the battle at the end is ridiculous and some of the character of Brock's speaking lines are hard to swallow though I think Grace did a decent job of portraying the cocky photographer. Overall I enjoyed the movie and though it shows signs of being rushed and again with too many characters, I can't help but feel a certain degree of finality to Spider Man 3. It could very well be the last time with see Tobey Maquire and Kirsten Dunst in the lead roles. If its decided to continue the franchise, it will probably be with different faces, which could mean a slow downward slide of the series. -- I hope not.",Null,0,0,6 May 2007
Captain America: The First Avenger," Marvel Shines Again - Captain America First Avenger - First Rate
","Captain America the First Avenger is an excellent adaption of the super hero who originated back in the 1940's. The film not only captures the flavor and essence of the time period and its characters, but an exciting good versus evil element in its most fundamental form. Chris Evan plays the part of Steve Rogers perfectly - a young man who wants to serve his country in its most perilous time. What we see is a 'good man' who transforms into a hero that is not only needed in his own time but possibly one to set an example for future generations too. Tony Stark as Iron Man has his inner demons, Thor has his arrogance and his family nobility to live up to, the Hulk has his anger issues - but with Captain America, you know you have a man, true and devoted to a code, who will always, no matter where or what, will do the right thing.The action scenes are excellent, fast-paced and exciting. The supporting characters are especially well done - Hugo Weaving as Red Skull, Tobey Jones as Arnim Zola, Tommy Lee Jones as Col. Phillips, Stanley Tucci as Abraham Erskine, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark and Sebastian Shaw as Bucky, all round out a good cast of characters; each having a vital part in the story, yet also blend and develop and carry the story along with Cap in a smooth and uncomplicated way.*Note: In a series of films that are leading up to possibly one of the most anticipated of the super hero series - 'The Avengers' each individual entry has and is tied to each other and has a direct effect on the one film that will bring them all together. If this series of films, which is essentially the combined ingredients to the one film, is successful - it may prove to be one of the most successful film series pulled off in cinema history.Iron Man, Thor, and The Incredible Hulk all stand alone very well - I think each one has been adapted to the big screen in a positive way, staying true to the real source from the comic books and each has a good dose of excitement, action and likable characters with surprisingly good depth - and I hope we will see more of their adventures individually. But for some reason, I can't help but feel that in some way that Captain America was a measuring stick in the series to determine whether the genre lives. If Cap was a failure, I think Marvel would be second-guessing whether to proceed with other films - if one of their most popular characters were to crash and burn then we may not see anymore after the Avengers. But - happy to say, I heard a resounding stamp of approval at the ending credits of this film and an even more intense reception at the short preview clip of the Avengers in the post credits. Not only does Captain America, Iron Man, Thor and the others pave the way for the Avengers but possibly future film treatments from the Marvel Universe. I'm sure that Marvel is banking on the success of these films to determine whether they have the green light to consider bringing other Marvel characters such as Dr. Strange, Black Panther, Namor, Vision, Hawkeye and perhaps a better version of the Silver Surfer and Fantastic Four and Daredevil too, into the mix.After seeing Captain America, it without a doubt, stands as one the pillars of the series.Can't wait to see Cap in the Avengers.",Null,14,31,23 July 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Outstanding
","For having never actually read the books, I don't believe I have ever been so familiar with a particular story before in my life. When I realized the grand scale that this epic was based on, I knew it would be near impossible to bring it to the big screen and do justice to it. Having been told this story by countless people (especially my old high school pal Curtis) I was somewhat familiar with the world of Hobbits and Elves, however I was skeptical that a large-budget film could be pulled off.Peter Jackson, I think would have made Mr.Tolkien proud.I purposely refrained from snatching up the books and reading them before going to see the film. I wanted to see the material fresh, without knowing all the intricate details. I was captivated.The cinematography was breath-taking and the characters extremely in-depth. Some stories and movies have a lot of characters but just there, filling space, one-dimensional and utterly boring. In this film I was astonished how well the cast brought such a multitude of characters to life. Goes to show you what good casting can do. And not just using a big name to cash in on, which is the usual practice of Hollywood.Tolkien's story is somewhat complex and several of my friends and relatives just found it too overwhelming and uninteresting. But myself, I connected immediately with the characters and damn-well surprised that I did. One of the unforgettable scenes for me involved Bilbo played beautifully by Ian Holm. I was quite moved. (And he only had a few scenes in the whole flick!)Every film has its flaws, and this one is no exception. I certainly will not jump on the film makers for excluding every minute detail, like so many of the Tolkien faithfuls do. It's bad enough that we have to listen to these nut-cases whine about it. And it's time they snap out of the their own little fantasy worlds and quit being a nuisance.No, I still will not buy the books, and won't be dressing up as Gandalf while I wait in line for the next film, but I saw a very good movie and it will definitely be among my own personal collection when it's released on video.",Null,0,0,4 June 2002
Spider-Man," well done
","After seeing Spiderman, I'm pleased to see that the super-heroes we loved as kids and some of us still as adults are finally being brought to the big screen they way they should be. No more hokey scripts like the one's that destroyed the Batman series, and CG effects that do them justice. Maybe Hollywood will finally pull their head out and realize these stories are box office gold if they are taken seriously and done right.X-Men was good, and it was also done with good believable dialogue and acting. Spiderman continues that trend. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst do a commendable job, and again like so many characters of this type which happen to be young adults like Peter Parker, the problems and emotions that they go through are believable. Which is why Marvel Comics stays in business as long as they have, because they inject this very ingredient into their comic books.Hopefully the upcoming 'Hulk' movie will stay on this course. I'd love to see more of the Marvel and DC heroes on the big screen in the near future.",Null,0,0,22 May 2002
Batman Begins," Best Batman film to date
","Finally a film about Batman that treats the material in the way that it should. Director Christopher Nolan presents the title character in a way that makes all the other film treatments obsolete as far as I'm concerned. An outstanding cast lead by Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman and supported by an incredible A-Team of performers - Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Rutger Hauer and Tom Wilkinson.Nolan combines a clever story that embodies all the mystery and circumstances that make up the origins of Batman and the events that lead the Gotham millionaire to become the Caped Crusader. None of the ridiculous camp of the other films - its a well done story that tells of one man's search for answers and his confrontation with his destiny as well as all the action you expect from Batman.The audience is introduce to Wayne traveling to the mountains of the Himilayas to learn from a mysterious man named Ra's al Ghul where he learns the ways to fight crime - then returns home to the seedy streets and denizens of Gotham City and takes on the powers that have corrupted the city his father crusaded so hard to save.Its particularly enjoyable seeing how Wayne invents all the gadgets and weapons that make up his arsenal and how he develops the famous suit - but the most fun part was the early version of the Batmobile called the 'Tumbler' - an amazing vehicle which is something between a Hummer and a tank - these scenes rumbling down the streets of Gotham and launching into the Batcave are awesome.Everything that went wrong in the other Batman films are all done wonderfully right in this one - Batman Lives Again!",Null,1,2,11 May 2011
Ghost Rider," Pathetic
","When I saw the trailer for this film last summer, I was convinced that it was going to be another Marvel blockbuster, little did I know that the scenes in the trailer were the best scenes and the only scenes worth watching.This film is an embarrassment to the other Marvel entries. This movie makes Daredevil and even Elektra look good.Nicolas Cage tries to be witty and sincere in his performance as Johnny Blaze the Ghost Rider, but comes off looking like something between a cheap Evel Kenievel and Elvis imitator. Eva Mendes is awful in her role. She's neither convincing as a long lost flame (no pun intended) or a reporter. The young lady who played the younger Roxanne character fared much better. The scene where Blaze chases down Roxanne while she's driving away in the TV van is funny, but when she finally stops jumps out and snaps at him and eventually re-kindles their love life, she only looks like a sassy teenager, I've seen better acting in a high school play. Mendes' best attributes are the pair she wears on her chest, which the director obviously goes to every length to emphasize throughout all her scenes. When was the last time you saw a TV reporter on camera with half her blouse un-buttoned. Nice rack Eva, but you could use some acting lessons.Sam Elliott puts in a good performance, seems he's making yet another appearance in a Marvel film (as Ross in the Hulk) where he's the only human character worth watching.By the time Blaze hunts down Mephisto's brat son gone postal, I couldn't wait for this movie to be over.The scene where Ghost Rider is riding down the side of a skyscraper is the best scene and the only scene worth seeing. Don't waste your money on the DVD when it comes out, just watch the trailer and you'll get the only good scenes of the whole movie.",Null,1,3,5 March 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Good action - Average characters - falls short
","**This comment will definitely contain a spoiler** Anxious to see the third installment in the X-Men series I was a bit taken back when I found out it was a clean up and kill it off finale. Though I give the filmmakers credit for boldly taking out some of the main characters which was definitely a surprise, I was disappointed in some of the dialogue, and the storyline looked rushed. I love seeing the Juggernaut (though I was disappointed with his helmet) and Colossus with a larger role (they should have had these two squaring off in the final battle scene) I liked what they did with Mystique's character. Kelsey Grammar did an excellent job of portraying Beast, other good performances - Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, but overall it lacked the impact of X2. Again the story and characters looked rushed. If you're going to have lots of characters - then give them substance, don't just have them filling up space. I hope this isn't the end of the X-Men movies. I'm glad to at least hear that they are working on a Wolverine movie and a Magneto movie. And hopefully some of the characters in XMen 3 will show up in future films.*Don't turn off your DVD's right after the final scene though, watch the big surprise after the credits roll at the end or you won't get the whole picture.",Null,0,1,23 February 2007
Hellboy," What the Hell
","After seeing this movie during its initial release I remember leaving the theatre feeling that I had gotten my money's worth of entertainment for the day but not as thrilled as I did after seeing X-Men and Spiderman. Remembering it as being a bit campy but fun, I assumed it would inevitably fall into that ever-increasing pile of Saturday matinée adventures that would eventually fade and ultimately be forgotten from that enormous movie data bank in my head. But since that first viewing at the cinema, I have seen it a few times on TV and I have come to the conclusion that I really like this campy, fun movie. I find myself stopping to watch a few scenes while surfing the channels on TV and keep getting caught watching it, like a ten year old, sneaking into the theatre.Ron Perlman is great and his performance is what carries the film. I love the way he delivers the comic book style dialogue and one-liners. I particularly like the time period the story is set in and the cinematography.

Moulin Rouge!," Smashing!
","The opportunity to see Obi Wan Kenobi sing was too much too pass up. Didn't really know what to expect, but from the opening scene to the final note, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Brilliant to take a classic setting like the Moulin Rouge and inject it with contemporary music. I was completely blown away by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor's performances, they were terrific, and they had great chemistry. The Elephant Love Medley gave me goosebumps.*Possible Spoiler*I have never really been impressed by Nicole Kidman in the past, but her scenes were sexy, charming and the dramatic scene where she races back to Christian's arms, not being able to go through with her seduction of the Duke, was gripping and put a lump in my throat that very few other movies have in a long time. Kidman received all the accolades and awards and deservingly so, however it was McGregor who impressed me the most. A good, strong singing voice, excellent in the dramatic scenes and equally good in the comedy scenes, proving yet again the range, diversity and talent of this actor.I now have the movie soundtrack and the video and can enjoy it many times over. Good entertainment - Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all- Love.",Null,0,0,9 June 2002
The Dark Knight," Unbelievable!
","Christopher Nolan's 'Batman Begins' brought a much deserved return of the Caped Crusader that the cinema audiences wanted - true to the material and portraying Batman/Bruce Wayne in the fashion that makes this iconic character so fascinating.The sequel 'The Dark Knight' delves even deeper and the finished product on the screen is - a masterpiece.The script is outstanding and the action never lets up. Christian Bale proves once again, as Batman, why this series is so good. He brings intensity magnetism and depth to both Bruce Wayne and Batman, and when in the suit, he commands the screen.In this film we find the criminal underworld still fighting for the reins of Gotham City but this time, from out of the smoke of spitting automatic rifles and greasy, unscrupulous mobsters, comes what will prove to be Gotham's true nightmare.Heath Ledger as the Joker is unforgettable - his performance is absolutely mesmerizing - he is hilarious and blood-chilling at the same time - I kept saying to myself - 'Its not possible that it is Ledger under that make-up.' his performance is one of most impressive I have ever seen on screen. I can't imagine what it was like to be one of the other actors and playing a scene on the same set - all the Joker's scenes are incredible - you can't take your eyes off him.Underneath the primary plot of a story are two determined forces pitted against one another, we are treated to a brilliant illustration of two characters that walk a fine line of being almost the very same product - both created out of some deep-rooted tragic circumstance from a dark past, two tormented souls driven by both power and pain. In the end only one will walk away - but at what cost?The rest of the cast, notably Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart - all bring symbolic elements to the story - wisdom, loyalty, dedication, honor and justice - coupled with their own individual, personal drives.This film is so well done you forget you are watching a comic book super hero flick - this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.",Null,0,3,11 June 2011
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Pure Magic
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and and I rate it up there with the all-time great 'kids' movies. A wonderful blend of Cinderella and Wizard of Oz. I have it now on video and have seen it twice and it's great fun. I think perhaps I understand now why kids really gobbled this up. Just the simple fact that kids tore themselves away from the computer games and picked up a book, is an amazing feat in itself. But I salute J.K. Rowling for providing the youngsters with something highly entertaining and that promotes good, positive things for kids -- Loyalty, friendship, teamwork. Not evil and black magic. For all the individuals who claim that the  material in this film is corrupting the minds of youngsters -- need to have their heads examined. Chances are, several of these narrow minds didn't even see the film in the first place.A brilliant cast. I'm so glad they chose to stick with a British cast. To attempt to 'Americanize' it would have been a crime.Daniel Radcliffe was excellent as Harry -- unsure and a bit uncomfortable with his celebrity status but humble and very likable. A true hero for the kids. Harry's pal Ron played by Rupert Grint was absolute gold. He has the best lines and delivers them like a pro. Even after multiple viewings, I still bust out laughing at his scenes. Emma Watson plays her part to perfection. How many of us had a classmate like her when we went to school? C'mon raise your hands.(before she does and shows you up in front of the teacher)A great supporting cast, and top rate visuals. Even on the small screen after seeing it on the big screen, it doesn't lose it's luster at all.

Thor," Another Marvel gem - THOR a thunderous hit
","Yes - it is worthyAfter seeing the other Marvel entries, I agreed with many that THOR would be the most difficult to adapt to the big screen and I was hopeful when I heard Kenneth Branagh would be directing, having enjoyed his Shakespeare films in the past and the possibility of lending his classic twist to a popular tale, and now after seeing this film, I am pleased to offer my congrats to Branagh and Marvel for bringing one of my favorite super hero characters to life.I was anxious and ready for the grand scope of special effects that would carry me across the rainbow bridge to Asgard and to see the Mighty Thor and his warrior companions in action, but I was very pleasantly surprised with the depth of the characters and the impressive performances from the cast.Aside from Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman, the main players are relatively unknown and yet it is these performances that impressed me most. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston may not be big names now but after this film that could quickly change. Hemsworth and Hiddleston are worth the price of admission alone, the classic sibling rivalry between Thor and Loki is made obvious but not overdone; especially in dialogue but rather skillfully played through body language and facial gestures (always been a firm believer that sometimes the best dialogue is NO dialogue) The action scenes are fantastic but again not overdone - only enough is offered to where you want to see them again.*SPOILER ALERT - One of the scenes that particularly stood out was - after being cast out of Asgard and banished to Earth, Thor fights off a squad of highly trained G-Men to claim his weapon but when he realizes that he can no longer lift his enchanted hammer he is devastated and the scene hits you full force - Hemsworth nails the scene perfectly and Branagh slam dunks this part of the story most of all, adding a great deal of depth to the lead character - Thor's face reveals the squandered opportunity to prove himself as rightful heir to the Asgardian throne and at the same time a son's inevitable desire for his father's blessing now being forever denied him. I was surprised to see this element so well done in a film of this sort. THOR is good entertainment with a good ensemble of characters and wonderfully brought to life with a good cast. I look forward to Thor's return.",Null,2,5,6 May 2011

","I'm glad to see that the X-Men series has rebounded after the very disappointing 'X-Men Origins - Wolverine' movie.'X-Men - First Class' benefits by a much better script and the brilliant pairing of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as the younger Professor X and Magneto. The film is carried by the two actor's excellent chemistry and personally I don't think they could have cast better performers for both parts.Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult stood out as well and bring good depth to their characters Mystique and Beast.However there are notable flaws from my view that have to be mentioned - Though I like Rose Byrne as Moira - I'm disappointed in the other X-Men they chose to include in this entry and how they portrayed them - Angel Salvadore a girl who is essentially an over-sized tinker bell - please! I kept waiting for her to whip out her magic wand and pixie dust - Havok and Banshee - poor but tolerable - but what about the character Darwin - boring - and not only that, he just shows up and then they kill him off - why have him in the movie in the first place? - and Azazel and Riptide - come on - when you have so many other better characters from the X-Men roster to choose from? I'm no X-Men historian but wasn't Iceman one of the original founding members?Kevin Bacon was OK as the villain and the character Emma Frost seemed a bit wasted and fades quickly from the plot but a good solid story and certainly the makings of a good series - overall - well done.",Null,0,2,8 July 2011
Iron Man," One of the best yet from Marvel
","With the success of the X-Men and Spiderman, it was inevitable that Marvel would eventually bring Iron Man to the big screen. At first, I envisioned a number of other top flight actors in mind for the part of Tony Stark but Robert Downey Jr. was not only the right choice but proved to be the main reason the film is such a huge hit.The action scenes are outstanding and the Iron Man suit is very impressive, making all the scenes in the suit worth the price of admission but the script and the performances are the real assets of this film - top rate. The witty and split-second dialogue are perfect for Downey Jr. and he plays it brilliantly - he and Jeff Bridges scenes are especially enjoyable and Bridges holds his own with the humor as well.*Spolier Alert: The scene where Tony is in his lab, first trying out his technology that will eventually become his suit - is hilarious - his charming relationship with his clumsy but loyal home-built robot assistant is particularly good but the part where, testing the suits thrust boosters, Tony slightly miscalculates and goes flying into the wall gets a laugh from me every time. The rest of the cast is good - Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and Clark Gregg as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Coulson all give good performances and director Jon Favreau deserves credit for direction, balancing excellent actions sequences with clever humor. This movie rates as one of top entries in the Marvel films - and don't leave until you see the scene after the credits.Iron Man in the upcoming Avengers movie should be a real treat.",Null,1,3,11 May 2011
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The movie that shook the world!
","The world of cinema has never been the same since George Lucas brought this film to the screen. It has had more impact on the world than any movie. It has become a living icon of story-telling to an entire generation and since it's release it has been the standard by which all epic blockbuster movies are measured.The original three films - most often referred to as the 'original trilogy' - 'Star Wars', 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' introduced us to a world - 'far, far away' but it became the very human element that millions identified with through the classic myth motif. Its images and symbols have bridged across cultures, its characters become house-hold words. I will never forget the first time I saw the opening frame of the spaceships crossing the screen in the first film and I will never experience another moment in the theatre like I did when in ROTJ, one of cinema's most recognized villains gave up his lust for power, discarded his evil past and once again found compassion through the love of his son who refused to abandon faith in him, to sacrifice himself to save his son and the galaxy. When Vader picked up the Emperor and threw him to his doom to save Luke - the entire theatre that I was sitting in that day, erupted with applause - the sound was deafening and like I have never before since experienced. George Lucas has given the world of cinema a great gift with his ground-breaking special effects technology and has set free imaginations and inspired countless film-makers since. His company Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) have broaden the scope of film-making to enormous heights, making nothing impossible to be seen on the screen; the boundaries, if any, are limited to only our imaginations.The Star Wars film saga may be over now, but it will live forever.",Null,0,0,13 April 2007
300," Forgettable
","90 percent of this film is action and 9 out of the 10 action (battle scenes) are shot with slow motion effect. If you take the slow motion out, this film would have been over in twenty minutes. Which is exactly how long it took me to know that I wouldn't be running out and recommending it to my friends.Based on the story by comic book famed Frank Miller who penned the brilliant Batman: Dark Knight graphic novel, 300 simply gets bogged down in overlong scenes of impaled soldiers, decapitations, CGI blood spatter and the heavy dose of cinematic machismo. This film is about a battle - that's understood going in, but it provides very little else. The scenes involving the queen Gorgo and the corrupt politician Theron, are done with about as much drama as two teen-agers getting sleazy behind the gym of their high school. The battle scenes are good but get monotonous very quickly. I personally would have rather enjoyed going to the cinema to see a film treatment of Batman/Dark Knight instead - perhaps one day soon. For the hardcore Miller and comic book fiends, this film I'm sure is right up their alley with its edgy cliché's and filtered photography but most likely this movie will end up in the large crap-pile of movies that couldn't make the step from comic book to big screen because it had nothing to offer other than blood, bronze, hard bodies and firm nipples - of course for many film goers - that's enough. However its a shame that the actors who played the Spartans had to spend so much time in the weight room only to see their efforts wasted on a film that will be forgotten in a few years.",Null,4,10,29 March 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," A Will Smith tour de force
","I was reluctant about sitting down and watching this film due to the fact that I assumed it would be the usual social injustice and rags to riches movie with all of Hollywood's latest political cliché's that normally come with it, but I came away very impressed and will now put myself into the category of - Will Smith fan.Smith is one of the actors today that comes off the screen as a natural - making it look easy. His past roles in comedy and action films have not been among my favorites (though I did like 'I Robot') because a lot of actors can do the same thing in similar type movies. But in this drama he is absolutely riveting. His performance is not over the top, which it could have been designed that way. Many films of this type do approach it that way in order to bludgeon the movie-goer over the head with its message - but this one does not, which is why it works. Smith handles the drama and tension of a man being pushed to his limits with such sharp subtlety that the emotion builds as the story moves along, that in the end you are right there with him, cheering him on, when all his efforts are finally rewarded.The scene where he is at the playground with his son with no home to go to is one of many moving scenes but this one particular scene really hit home. I have to include the dialogue - 'You got a dream, you gotta protect it. People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you that you can't do it. You want something? Go get it. Period.' The way Smith handles the character of Chris and his problems and endless obstacles with dignity is what stands out the most. It's inspiring, and every scene with him in it is memorable. A possible award winning performance in my opinion.",Null,0,0,14 April 2007
