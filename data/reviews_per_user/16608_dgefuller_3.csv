Resident Evil: Afterlife," 'It's easily as good as 'Land of the Dead'!' This is going to go well then...
","If you're watching this film then you know the drill:Act 1: There's no hope for humanity! Act 2: I've met some lovely people, perhaps there's hope after all! Act 3: Ah, no... no I was right, there's no hope left, just a terrible conspiracy from a greedy company(repeat acts 2-3 as necessary).It's a familiar recipe, and one that nobody here shies away from exploiting time and again. Still, 'Afterlife' is probably the best sequel to a film that was so poor it shouldn't have had one- let alone three. That being said, it only makes it as good as 'Land of the Dead'. How bad, I wonder, was Romero's screenplay for the original 'Resident Evil' that it was rejected in favour of this formulaic franchise?Though, like some criminally insane lunatic with an obsessive compulsive disorder, I have inexplicably been drawn to watch all four of these films. Some say Resident Evil: Extinction was unwatchable; it- like the first- bared some resemblance to the first two games from which it is adapted, the events from said shoot 'em-ups happening as a backdrop. And why not? It is an adaptation after all, and it's nice to have surprises. Shame then that's the only one the series offers.The action here is okay- but you could easily lose about 20 minutes of the running time by simply removing the slow motion bullets, kicks in the face and swinging/running away from things that are exploding. The director (Anderson, returning after a brief hiatus from the series to run 'Alien' and 'Predator' into the ground simultaneously and the shockingly watchable 'Death Race') loves looking at shiny guns, too- so we have to look a lot of shiny guns.The 'infected' are a bit boring (compared to the pants-wettingly terrifying ones in '28 Days/Weeks Later') and they seem to have a great deal of difficulty eating anything because they have four very long tongues with teeth embedded in them (a bit like the dog out of John Carpenter's 'The Thing'- a bit too much like that, actually). Furthermore, they look completely unbelievable (as if these zombies are walking around with a bad special effect stuck to their faces) and it's a gimmick that gets exhausted pretty quickly (Del Toro did something similar in 'Blade 2' as well, except he's a genius and doesn't submit to overkill).The villain wears sunglasses ALL THE TIME and has a big black trench coat. Frankly, that's so clich√©d it's beyond funny now: it's actually a little bit embarrassing, like that guy at college who STILL dresses like Neo from the Matrix. Seriously, it's been eleven years. Can we stop ripping that film off please? If it's not fashion, then it's the slow mo and the half-baked bullet time effects. It wouldn't be so bad if they weren't so terribly executed.The highlight of the film is the unexpected appearance of Neil from 'The Inbetweeners' sister. The plot's the same as always, there's nothing new on display here, there's not even any innovation in terms of death- everything gets bitten on the neck or gets shot several times- because guns ARE the solution.It's the best of the four, but it's still a sub-standard action/horror flick which delivers on neither action or horror. It's been bested by other, smarter films. I wouldn't mind the film being so dumb, so mind numbingly stupid if only it wasn't asking the audience to take it so seriously and this misguided self-belief that it's the greatest action/horror franchise of all time. It's the best video game inspired franchise of all time, but then again I think it might be the only video-game inspired franchise that hasn't been helmed by Uwe Boll (most other adaptations don't get sequels for damn good reasons- I don't see how Resident Evil was any better than, say, 'Doom'- which will never get a follow up).Also, the trailer gives away something that the film tries to keep as a surprise, given how the opening scene plays out... although it's pretty obvious to be fair. I can't say I'm disappointed, I knew it was going to be poor. And I will probably watch the fifth one too. Like I said, it's an illness.",5,0,2,15 October 2010
Alien: Resurrection," It's not Alien 4, it's a new beginning
","I've always been surprised as to how much negativity Alien Resurrection has generated. Like its direct predecessor, it is a much maligned piece of cinema. Unlike Alien3, however, Resurrection doesn't descend further into the harrowing nightmare that ended with Ripley's death; it completely shifts the paradigms of the series.You could easily view this film as something apart from the previous three. It doesn't even have Ripley in it, not really- it's a clone (one of eight), and Sigourney Weaver doesn't play her like she's Ripley, either. Undeniably, they look similar these two protagonists, but that is pretty much the only link. Other than the blood-thirsty aliens stalking the corridors of a military space station- which itself finally delivers on the idea of what might happen should 'The Company' (or at least 'a company' since Weyland-Yutani are no more 250 years into the future) get hold of alien DNA and mess about with it. It raises some really interesting ideas about the nature of the creature itself (how, exactly, do you clone a parasite from the host's blood sample? That's a sci-fi concept waiting to be explored), not to mention their more 'human' aspects (problem solving intelligence, for one, an implied sexual interest in their genetic grandmother- Ripley 8) making for some pretty nasty monsters.That's the bad point really though, because ever since James Cameron took a load of machine guns to a colony of xenomorphs in 1986, they've lost the menace the creature had in the 1979 original. They are just teeth and claws to be dispatched, and perhaps it's intentional with regard to these aliens being a little bit human, but they look far too organic (they even seemed to have developed goat legs, which doesn't make such sense, but perhaps it's for artistic flare, and the creatures do look very good, just not as good as they used to).Alien Resurrection really isn't business as usual, but then every film in the series has been different, so why not have a European black comedy thrown in, too? Personally, I love Jeunet's touch; despite his language barriers at the time, he injects great humour into the proceedings, without ridiculing the hallowed science fiction saga, and that is thanks to Joss Wedon's script. He's been incredibly vocal about his disappointment with the project, but Jeunet's visual style lends itself incredibly well to science fiction, creating a grubby, dystopian future an age away from the clean white space station of Aliens and a darn sight more believable. If man as a species takes to the stars, the universe will be filthy, and that is on display here in abundance.There are some fantastic set pieces(although the underwater sequence's CGI has dated in the last 13 years), and a brave attempt at taking the series in a new and frightening direction with the love it/hate it (mostly people seem to hate it) Newborn creature, born directly from the (sadly under-used) Queen's womb inherited from the genetic crossover (so when do we get to see Ripley laying eggs?).Like Alien3 before it, it takes up the reigns from an ending nobody really knows how to develop the series from. Sure, it would have been nice that Hicks and Newt made it. And sure, it might have been nice if Ripley hadn't died- but this series has been taking risks since the beginning. Captain Dallas should have been the hero way back in 1979, but he buys it halfway in. Ridley Scott pulls a Psycho on us, and we love it. Every time anyone else tries anything against the grain in this franchise, it's been met with disdain. The most popular entry into the series (Aliens) is the least subversive, all guns and war and even a happy ending. It's a masterclass in scifi action, sure, but I think Alien Resurrection is probably the bravest film of the four. It sort of writes itself into a hole at the end, but we've been there before with this series. I'd like to know what could happen next.Bizarre, grotesque, frightening and equal parts hilarious, beautiful and bold, Alien Resurrection is a film that has been brutalised by fans and critics alike; even by those who made it. It takes risks, and the result is a subversive and entertaining b-move schlock-fest with European sensibilities and an incredible visual flare (like Fincher, it doesn't matter how much a studio suppresses the choices of Jeunet, his style is too powerful to be completely oppressed).Alien was horror. Aliens was action. Alien3 was foreboding drama. Alien Resurrection is outlandish, kinetic and occasionally insane science fiction. You should give it another chance. But I still don't know why the aliens are brown in this one.",6,1,1,8 November 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight
","Scott Pilgrim has met the girl of his dreams, Romona Flowers. Now, he must face her seven evil exes if he is to keep dating her. Now imagine this love story is taking place inside a souped up Nintendo Entertainment System with some of the finest indie music the world has to offer, lovingly directed by the world's biggest geek and edited to perfection by joy pad wielding insaniacs intent on blowing up your eyes with colours.This film is the pinnacle of everything an immersion in pop culture can be. From the parody of the typical 'love against adversity' journey of any typical film, 'Scott Pilgrim' takes the idea of the journey and turns into an epic QUEST. What's more, it's refreshing that the hero of the piece is fundamentally flawed: pursuing a girl while in a relationship with another, however tame that relationship might be, is a basic rule of social villainy- and yet Scott Pilgrim is that awkward hero; not following the laws of what is right, rather going for what he wants and ignoring the consequences. That the protagonist is imperfect, selfish and thoughtless makes him more identifiable as a genuine human being rather than a pastiche of unachievable ideals, and anchors the film's emotional core against the absolute insanity that unfolds.Michael Cera is at his finest here. He is one of those comic actors who has an act and usually sticks with it- even reverting back to it in 'Youth in Revolt'- but here, Cera is not the meek nice guy. He still looks and sounds like Cera, but he's not the smart, sensitive boy we've come to know. He's fatally flawed and does bad things to good people on impulse. Like real people tend to on occasion. Further grounding comes from Kieran Culkin, a revelation as the straight man (so to speak) of the piece and one of several excellent supporting roles peppered throughout this character-packed story (Brandon Routh and Chris Evans can battle for the title of the best evil ex, but Tom Jane showing up as a member of the vegan police for about 20 seconds just blew my mind). Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Romona Flowers is so inexplicably cool you go against your gut and start pushing Pilgrim to fight for her (she even manages to flex some acting muscles, too- ranging from hardened introvert to heart-on-sleeve vulnerability to giant Thor-hammer smashing aggression).Everything about this film is effortlessly cool, from the fantasy fight scenes straight out of Tekken, one of many video game references that the film is saturated in (a dream sequence involves a flourishing arrangement of music from Zelda to great effect). The use of video games within the film could arguably be suggested a critique of our obsession with electronic influences on our lives, but I'm just guessing that the reason they used all of that stuff is because it just looks amazing- it sounds amazing too, probably one of the best contemporary soundtracks I've ever heard (thanks to contributions from Metric, Beck and uber-producer Nigel Godrich).On a technical level, this is Edgar Wright's finest achievement, harking back to the the heady days of sitcom 'Spaced' but with a few million dollars to really push the limits- and I don't believe he wasted a single penny.From the devastating reaction to sunlight (blissfully over the top comic-book framing) on an early morning, and the scuzzy bass that centres the film's soundtrack, you'll come out of this still not believing you just saw this movie. Your brain won't let you believe it's real. Well it's not, but it is a film. It has been made, with loving devotion to its source material- which as to why anyone would even try and commit that to the screen is beyond me, but Edgar Wright just did it. I think he can safely assume his place as one of the most unique and brilliant filmmakers in the industry right now, with this film as a portfolio promising what visions will come next.This film is perfect. There is literally nothing wrong with any of it. As far as the genre of 'comic-book adaptations' goes (which itself is ridiculous, you would throw every film based on a book into the same section at HMV- Jaws and Pride and Prejudice aren't the same now, are they?) this is one of the finest, most standout pieces made. As a fantasy adventure it's even credible, remaining resolutely laid back and lo-fi despite it's impeccable visual style.Just... outstanding.",10,6,17,30 October 2010
