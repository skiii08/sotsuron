The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Excellent film, cannot wait for part 2!
","I have loved these films since the first one was released and have been waiting for this film all year. It was definitely worth the wait! Despite a few changes from the book, the adaptation of the film was great and i think it was a good idea to have split the film into two parts as there was so much detail included. If you haven't read the book then i imagine the film would be slow but for readers all around i cant imagine the experience being anything less than enjoyable.Less action than the first two films without the actual Hunger Games involved however its still just as entertaining and enjoyable. After always thinking Josh Hutcherson was one of the weaker members of the cast he came through in this film giving what was probably one of his best performances yet.After becoming quite possibly one of my favourite films ever i would definitely recommend for everyone to watch it!",10,37,89,24 November 2014
