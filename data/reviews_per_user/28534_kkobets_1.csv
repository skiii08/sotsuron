Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Flick - Superb Special Effects - Good Story
","I really enjoyed this movie. I really like the epic nature of it. This reminds me of epic stories such as the Hobbit/Lord of The Rings. There are parts that may seem slow, but are necessary in building the story. Sound and Visuals were incredible. The computer generated worlds looked so real. I was a bit disappointed in the acting job by young Skywalker. He lacked the feeling that was needed for many of the scenes.   I am eagerly awaiting the next episode.",8,0,0,20 May 1999
