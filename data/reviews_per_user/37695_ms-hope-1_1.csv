50 First Dates," Excellent Movie!
","I just did not expect it to be as good as it was, it had me both laughing and in tears. It was just excellent! I never realized that there were people out there with real short term memory lost and I just think that Drew Barrymore (I loved her since 'Firestarter') play the role wonderfully and Adam Sandler was the sweetest doing what he did to make her remember him all in the name of love. Her father and brother both were sweet too for trying to make it easier for her before she met Henry. Her brother was hilarious with all the weight lifting and thinking he was Mr. Universe or something. Oh and what the heck was up with Alexa? I'm on here now to clear up m confusion about that one. :)",10,0,0,3 January 2005
