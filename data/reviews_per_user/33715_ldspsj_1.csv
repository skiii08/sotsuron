Sucker Punch," What's the difference between this and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World
","Meaningless fights.the whole time I was watching this movie, all I can think of is Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Even in the Scott Pilgrim movie, the characters get hurt, and there are times when you don't know how the fights would go.In this movie, the scantily clad girls with hot legs fight. After the first fighting scene, you just know things will be like that for the rest of the movie.The hot girls fight, they shoot, cut, hit. It's ridiculous. Not even funny after a couple of fights.Yeah,yeah I get it. It gives us the profound message that we are sometimes not the center of the story. We should sacrifice ourselves when the time comes for other people. well, if the director really wanted to get that message across, he should have focused on it! I don't know if I was watching a profound movie with deeper meaning, or if I was watching a comic book, or if I was watching a porn. I didn't know what to focus.The characters are not developed at all. The different layers of story don't match.Let me give you a piece of advice.If you want to enjoy this movie, focus on one thing, whether it would be girls with hot legs and boobs, be CG, be fighting scene, or be the message that they claim the movie has.",1,11,22,15 August 2011
