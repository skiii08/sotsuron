Hereditary," Underwhelming horror movie
","Watched Hereditary with a friend. Both of us are fans of good horror, and had high hopes after reading good reviews. With a metascore of 87 we felt we could be in for a treat. However, the movie failed to grip us in any way. It was a long slow journey towards a disappointing end. Tension starts to build at certain points, but lets up too quick and we loose a bit interest in the characters as the movie progresses.The actors do a good job, but sometimes direction have them overact and that looses some of the impact. Some scenes are horrific, others almost comical. Can't recommend Hereditary to horror fans, but if you want a 'different' sort of family drama with a satanic theme, give it a try and see what you think.",6,1,3,4 November 2018
John Wick," Disappointing!
","John Wick disappointed on several levels. I probably had too high expectations, but the 'one-man-army/revenge' concept has been done so many times before and done much better than this. The movie is rather boring - no real story here, and the characters aren't very interesting. The action scenes are mediocre and too much 'over the top'. The whole thing just gets really tedious after a while.The revenge concept needs to generate sympathy from the viewer, and we need to be interested in seeing the revenge getting carried out. This movie didn't manage to do any of that for me. I was surprised to read quite a bit of positive reviews of John Wick, and a metascore of 68 was also surprising. I'm normally in line with at least the IMDb score, but this time I can't find much in this movie that warrants more than a 4.0 rating.",4,16,26,12 July 2016
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Great comedy
","Nicholas Stoller has put together a great comedy, and Jason Segel, who also wrote the script, does a solid job as the main character. He's funny, he's believable and you sympathize with his situation. There are several hysterical moments in this movie, and unless you think nudity is something ugly we need to be protected from, you'll going to have a good time. The movie does what it sets out to do - give you some light entertainment - nothing more, nothing less.Comedies can something get a bit too silly or 'over the top', but this on track. There are some scenes I would have liked to see gone, but all in all I had a good time, and I was never bored.",8,2,6,11 October 2009
"I Love You, Man"," Delightful!
","This was such a delightful movie! Funny and touching with a small doze of reality mixed in. All in all a great movie and good acting. Paul Rudd is perfect for the role, and I was actually a little surprised how well I enjoyed his character and the way he portrayed it. The awkward moments in the movie really makes you feel awkward and there are plenty of laughs throughout the movie. Jason Segel also plays very well, and Rashida Jones is the perfect girlfriend:-)! John Hamburg has put together one of the better comedies I've seen lately. It never goes overboard or becomes too silly. Directing is tight, but loose enough to make it fun to watch.I highly recommend this movie!",8,1,2,8 October 2009
We Were Soldiers," Very good!
","I never been in combat, but I felt this movie showed how it really is. The script, the action, the horrible realizm really gets you, including a soundtrack that makes you physically feel the war around you.  Except for one scene with fake helicopters, I would have to give this movie a next best after Saving Private Ryan.",8,1,2,21 October 2002
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Great fun!
","This movie does exactly what it sets out to do - give you a hilarious, fun (and silly) and entertaining 98 minutes (including credits). It has no ambition to be taken seriously and the haters here are so off base it's funny. If you take this movie for what it is, you'll like it. Quality production, decent acting and plenty of well-directed action that never gets boring. Cool effects, both sound and visual, in fact this movie's soundtrack is excellent. The story is very simple and dialog is sometimes a bit silly, but do you really care in a movie like this? If you don't like over-the-top adventure/fairy-tale/fantasy, you're at the wrong movie, if you do, you'll like this one. 7/10.",7,0,1,20 June 2013
Jurassic World," Great entertainment
","If you like the Jurassic movies, you won't be disappointed, as long as you don't expect too much character depth or clever story line. Yes, the characters are a bit one dimensional and the story.., well, it is what it is.The animation and special effects are very good. You believe the animals are alive, and one scene in particular may even bring out a tear or two.For the very young audiences, the movie might be a bit intense, but I don't think it would serve the movie right to tone down the creature violence. If you have a flesh-eating dinosaur running after you, you'll probably going to get eaten!Despite the clich√©s and the fact that it can't touch the original, my friends and I had a very good time watching Jurassic World. I felt the movie delivered a great 4th installment of the Jurassic family. So, go see it; the action will keep you thrilled throughout the movie.",7,0,5,15 June 2015
Drag Me to Hell," Somewhat disappointing
","I simply had too high expectations for this movie. Had heard good things and read positive reviews, but all in all I was disappointed. The acting was not convincing and there are moments in this movie that are plain stupid and the whole thing just becomes silly and far from scary. The first 20 minutes are good, but then things get out of hand. It seems the director went home.OK, so this movie is not meant to be taken seriously, and maybe the parts I found stupid was made that way on purpose; maybe to make us laugh? Who knows? I just wanted a good scare and ended up laughing! If I wanted to watch a comedy I would have chosen a comedy, not a movie that pretends to be horror!",5,2,4,6 August 2010
August Rush," A feel-good movie with minor flaws
","A lot of people have already pointed out that you shouldn't watch this movie if you don't like fairy tales. However, if you leave logic and other boring things from real life at the door, you may have a nice time.I admit there're a few moments when things went a little overboard, but all in all the movie gave me a good feeling and that's all that matters to me. If the story intrigues you, see it, I'm pretty sure you'll feel good too:-).August Rush is worth watching for us who still have some dreams inside of us and don't need to be reminded of the world we live in all the time!",7,3,4,23 April 2008
