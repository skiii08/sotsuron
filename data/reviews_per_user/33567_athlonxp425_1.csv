Sucker Punch," My Bad Review
","I give this a 2, only because of the hot babes. But I will not recommend this movie. If you are a lesbian, you may enjoy this film because of the mental capability women can have when they use both sides of there brain, in which they can, especially under stressful environments as in this movie. But the previews are misleading. I saw this movie tonight at Regal Streets of Indian Lake., and what makes it bad is there in a mental institution, and all of a sudden a fantasy world fighting creatures and, wtf?It was pure garbage, the story was non sense, I hate it. Sorry but I really want a my 10.50 back for this, or a free movie ticket to make up for my lost money I worked hard for to pay for this bullshit. I paid to much, and I didn't get my student discount.",2,12,26,26 March 2011
