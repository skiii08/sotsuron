Skyfall," A pure insult of intelligence, total lack of creativity, almost worst Bond ever
","First off: I love Bond movies.Secondly I made this IMDb account purely to vent my frustration about this total utter crap of a movie.I mean sure.. There are nice cars in there and a few pretty ladies but that's it.The opening scene demonstrates exactly what is utterly wrong with this movie. This is not a spoiler: 'Bond arrives into a room and finds a shot agent. (harddrive missing..omg terrorists!) Bond stays in the room checking out some stuff and helping his agent for a little while before heading out.Now you'd think the guys who stole the HD would at least drive off with some speed. But no Bond comes outside only to find his colleague in a car and the terrorists EXACTLY (10 meters) in front of them in a black car.'I mean seriously... Then this goes on on on.... Like on the train fighting scene shortly after... Where the villain and Bond exchange 100s of bullets but the moment Bond is actually behind him (and can put a bullet straight into his brain) he suddenly decides to jump onto him...Please DIRECTOR why didn't you at least fake that his bullets we're out..It's all just insulting, rushed etc.Big budget, big cars, big make-up faces but a total disregard for the little things that make you at least believe a part of what's going on.Just a big disappointment :(",4,4,21,6 February 2013
