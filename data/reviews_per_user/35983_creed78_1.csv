Requiem for a Dream," Disturbingly beautiful
","Beautifully disturbing or disturbingly beautiful...I can't decide the best way to describe this movie.  It really grabs you and doesn't let you go, it creates all kinds of emotion in you as you watch, and it's so masterfully crafted that you can't turn away.  I won't get into details of the story other than say its about the effects of drug addiction on several different characters.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to the faint of heart, but for those who can stomach some pretty unsettling sights and ideas, this movie's emotional payoff is worth it.  Very much worth it.",9,0,0,5 November 2000
