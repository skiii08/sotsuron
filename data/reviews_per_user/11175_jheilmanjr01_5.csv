E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The best alien film of all-time
","My mom told me she took me to see ET in the theatres when I was 2. She said I enjoyed it so much that she went out and bought me an ET doll, which I carried around until I was 10. When ET first came out on video in I believe 1988? I was so excited! It's great to know that they will be releasing ET again in the theatres next spring with new footage. That's gonna be really cool. That will be my chance to take my 2 year old to see one of my all-time favorite movies.",10,1,2,6 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Best of the Star Wars flicks
","I thought Return of the Jedi was the best of the first three Star Wars movies. I like seeing characters that were previously 'masked' be seen for the first time. It was cool finally getting to see what Darth Vador looked like. It must have been a hard and impatient wait for those who watched the movies and had to wait for them to be released in the theatres! Waiting 6 years, wow! I don't think I could have waited that long. Overall, I thought this one was the best of the 3. In 2005, I'll be letting you know what I thought of the last three.",8,0,1,3 November 2001
"Monsters, Inc."," A great family movie
","I was bored this past Saturday and decided that I would go and see this movie. I liked Toy Story and Toy Story 2, so I figured this was going to be a good movie. I was right, it was an excellent movie. Like most Disney movies, it was a great flick for children and adults alike. It was comedic at times like Toy Story, but overall I thought it was better. I would recommend this to anyone. Especially with children.",10,0,1,6 November 2001
The Princess Bride," Andre The Great
","Although Andre The Giant (AKA Andre Rousimoff) did not play in a lot of movies, he will always be remembered for enormous size, but most importantly, his enormous heart. Andre did a pretty good job acting despite having problems speaking at times, but was known as the 'lovable giant' to many. I'll always remember him for the truly large character he played (in WWF), Andre The Giant. Rest in peace big guy.",5,5,16,6 November 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," Frank Darabont's Debut Masterpiece
","This I have to say was one of my favorite movies of all time. I didn't see it until 1998 though. I had heard about it, but never actually had seen it. But when I did, I went out and bought it on video. I've always liked Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins has become a favorite of mine too. For some reason I like prison movies. It's just the suspense that really gets me. Movies like Escape From Alcatraz, The Green Mile, Instinct, and The Last Castle are among my favorites. To anyone who has not yet seen this movie, go rent it tonight, you will not be disappointed!",10,0,0,6 November 2001
