3:10 to Yuma," More than Adequate Grave robbing
","Hardly the economical and quietly tense classic the original is, but better than could be expected from the usual Hollywood grave robbery. More overtly violent (as was to be expected, although - I think - to good effect) and more obvious about its presentation of ethics and psychologies - i.e. it loses much of the iconic and poetic flavor of the original, which is due in part to the fact it is in color. Still, a more than adequate exploration of the same themes.",8,1,2,17 December 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," More Exciting than Tarkovsky!
","It is difficult to see clearly now (after decades of Star Wars and Star Trek on the more commercial side of space films) ) but this was a groundbreaking film, brave even in its most mystical scenes, deliberately (and hypnotically) tedious, with one certified great villain in HAL, easily the most human performance in the film. The 'light show' in the middle is stunningly dull now, bereft as we are of the necessary mescaline, 2000 light years from Woodstock, and stuck in the checkout line. But this is a bearable indulgence. Like so many Kubrick films (apart from 'Strangelove') this demands a more-than-average forbearance, but, after seeing Tarkovsky, this becomes less severe in comparison. An aesthetic triumph which continues to generate discussions over its philosophical statements.",10,3,5,17 December 2018
