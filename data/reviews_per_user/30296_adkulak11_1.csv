The Perks of Being a Wallflower," An Academy Award worthy, but unfortunately ignored film
","I have never connected to a group of characters in a film like I have with the Wallflowers. As a person living with social anxiety, I can place myself in the shoes of Charlie in almost every event in this film, from the first school dance to saying goodbye to the seniors after they graduate, Logan Lerman gives, in my opinion, one of the greatest performances of the 21st century. This film's screenplay, it's direction, and the performances of Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller were all Oscar worthy. Unfortunately, before you even have a chance to experience the film, it is lumped in with the typical, half-assed, campy coming-of-age comedy-dramas. This film catches the raw emotion, sarcasm and fears associated with the first year of high school. If you see one more film in your adult life, I urge you to view The Perks of Being a Wallflower.",10,0,1,28 December 2014
