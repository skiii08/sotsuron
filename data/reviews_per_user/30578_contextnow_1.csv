Sucker Punch," Youth Art
","Complaining about this movie is like complaining that a Monet is blurry, or that Memento is confusing. This isn't a linear allegory where each thing exactly represents something, and the construction isn't linear. It creates impressions, like abstract art, and it's point, I think, is the power of fantasy in marshaling one's will to accomplish and be free.It isn't genius-level, like Monet or Memento, but it is definitely good youth art, and visually excellent. Despite being a retired gentleman, I'm a film buff and could admire and enjoy it for what it is, instead of wishing it was something else.",7,2,3,3 August 2012
