Marie Antoinette," It pays to be FCC's daughter
","Is it me being numb or it just happened that Sophia Coppola managed to make a movie about 18th century France and fill it with 1980's music? Did she watch A Knight's Tale and decided she has talent enough to copy the concept? It pays to be FFC's daughter. I understand that she was not attempting to make a historically accurate depiction but there is a limit for inaccuracy. Some where I heard that she was trying to attract the younger generation by using the music, ... I am glad that she did not get hold of 'the windows, the walls ...' and the 2k music.From the beginning it is not good, I am finding myself struggling to zone out the music so i can focus on the scene. There are so many stupid mistakes that even with the totally not fitting music you can not miss them. SC had such a great research team that they failed to tell her this: In France the wedding ring is on the right hand!! How many times do you need to see MA waking up, not sexed yet to get the point? Ms. Coppola really does well trying to enter the sex into the movie by showing KD, naked standing in the distance a couple of times. The genius in little Sophia is proved by the scene at 55 min and 55 sec into the movie. Marie Antoinette is choosing shoes and a canvas converse is in her wardrobe! Light blue and white rubber sole, fat laces! Was she in the edit room that day? Did I see a black man teaching Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna von Habsburg-Lothringen AKA Marie Antoinette, queen of France playing music??!!! 120 minutes into the movie so we can see that MA is spending, gambling and at last has a daughter. Everyone in the movie speaks English, but the little girl utters a few French words to make sure you know that they are French. There are so many talented people that can not get the privileges afforded to Ms. Coppola to make a movie and here she is making a new style of movie making. Her attempt to show MA as a person fails at the part of not showing the true tragic moments of her capture, imprisonment and watching her friends getting behead; most of all Duchess de Lamballe, the original person who said; 'then they should eat cake'. Her own beheading was not even the point. KD does a very good job in regards to portray of the naive and shallow MA. One truly great work in this movie that I believe saved the whole darn thing was Milena Canonero the Costume Designer and Make Up & Hair designers, by Jean-Luc Russier and Desiree Corridoni .
