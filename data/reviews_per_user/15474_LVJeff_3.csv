Casablanca," Humphrey Bogart is the Man
","One thing is for certain: Humphrey Bogart is the man who speaks for himself. I just watched this movie at last, after trying to find an opportunity to watch it for quite some time now.  I've never watched Bogart before, and Casablanca was as good a start as any.  Let me say that I am quite impressed!  We are living in a world today where men try to emulate and women are quite taken by those men who are the paragon of the tough, solid man, often with an attitude, which is all the while a somewhat thin front for a sense of sentiment and nobility.  Or, to put it another way, we love the bad-ass with a heart and a sense of right.  With all the actors that we see nowadays, and all the characters that they portray, it's easy to forget who many of these Hollywood molds owe their respects to.  And, in this movie, Bogart is the man, one of the originals, a 1942 tough act, class act, a man who shows others how to be a man.This is his movie all the way, and he makes it a man's movie.  Don't get settled in on Ingrid Bergman too much, however beautiful she may be.  She's plays a tough woman, but Bogart is control.  And nevermind Paul Henreid, taller and perhaps more handsome than Bogart.  He may have the heroic reputation, but Bogart's cynicism makes him identifiable.  The things that Bogart's character, Rick, went through, and the new situation he is presented with, were very familiar to me and, I'm sure, to others.  What do you do when the one you love is with another?  What do you do when there is nothing wrong or, worse yet, it is the better thing to do for her to be with the other?  What do you do when the power then lies within you to decide whom she will then belong to, you or him?  Weaker men would fold.  Bogart takes the situation and tells it where it can go.I was quite happy with what I saw as the movie finished up.  It was a movie, as others have boasted in its name, that required no special effects, no fancy twisted storyline, and no distracting side plots.  It's a tight package, wrapped up nicely and presented almost as straightforward as could be.  Best of all, though, it's a story told about the strength of one character, and one character alone.  It's about his point of view, his dilemma, his solution.  It's about Rick, and only Bogart could have pulled off Rick in this memorable way.  This is Bogart's movie.  Watch the screen portray the strength of the man.",10,0,0,19 June 2000
Mulan," Coming from a Chinese POV
","While most critics went into this movie expecting another typical Disney animated flick, I went in with another interest in mind: to see if Disney would give a respectable treatment to a Chinese subject.  Asian culture and their stories get limited enough time as it is in the theaters, so, being of Chinese blood, movies like Mulan are something for me to look forward to as a moviegoer.I am happy to say that I was delighted by what I saw.  On the surface was, expectedly, a rather typical Disney treatment of the alienated heroine who fights for acceptance.  However, it was framed within an uncompromising traditionalist Asian mentality, and I found it quite satisfying to see Disney pull few punches as far as this mentality was concerned: that women are inferior.  They are worthless, secondary, and there only to support men. A Disney be-yourself story is perfect against this backdrop, and it was great to see the backdrop itself so relentlessly illustrated.A normally watered down story might have featured a heroine set back by her own naturally limited abilities (such as Ariel's being a mermaid not allowing her to walk on land), but Mulan was stuck in a world where prejudices against whom she inherently was were not only unchecked but accepted as fact.  As someone who has been repeatedly irked by the ridiculous traditional Asian/Chinese view that women are inferior, Mulan's presentation enthralled me as the perfect situation to triumph out of. Everything in the movie reinforced this.  Mulan is to be presented like a piece of fruit to get married; she can not join the army under penalty of death; women are repeatedly referred to as not being able to do a man's job; etc.  Even the songs were extremely well-written to reinforce this: 'Be a Man' straightforwardly suggests that only a man is capable of being strong enough to go to war; 'A Girl Worth Fighting For' has the troops objectifying women to what they look like and cook like; 'Honor to Us All' has a great line: 'We all must serve our emperor... our boys by bearing arms, our girls by bearing sons.'  Over and over again, the Asian mentality which I had witnessed so much myself firsthand was being pounded in to audience primarily made of impressionable kids!  Let me tell you, it was great!It was great to see that old Chinese mentality exposed, even if it was in a colorful musical, to a young audience.  And it was great to see that mentality refuted by the story itself: that a woman could be resourceful enough to help win a war and defeat a major villain _without_ becoming a man.  I really appreciated it.  The extra touches of 'Chinese-ness' were also appreciated: Mulan's exclaiming 'ai-ya!', the Ancestors and their place in the family homelife, the reverence under which the Emperor was held, the wicked official (ancient Chinese history is full of them).  One of my friends saw this in a theater full of Asians, and he said the audience received the movie with cheerful enthusiasm.  Even my parents appreciated the effort put into the movie, with my mother, self-proclaimed cartoon-hater, giving it a thumbs up!This movie did not go to lengths to misunderstand and poke fun at the Chinese.  It really did a fine job getting the point just right, especially in the conveyed attitude toward women.  Thus it scores on two levels: it shows that the Chinese can be heroic and that women are equal with men. It makes the kids happy and Asians can be in on the jokes.  I think this was a great achievement.P.S. For those of you who wonder about the actual story of Mulan: the story exists as a poem.  Much of it is spent describing in detail how Mulan made herself to appear as a man, and then back as a woman after the war was over, and, so I've been told, not much else.  The Chinese mostly regard it as one of those stories you've heard about, like the way Americans regard fairy tales.  I think it was a perfect story for Disney to 'raid,' in its usual way :-)",10,5,7,3 August 2000
Jaws," All that it's cracked up to be
","Wow, it took me forever to finally get to see this movie.  Previous to yesterday, all I had ever seen was the ending (like the last five minutes). That didn't spoil it for me as I sat down to watch the DVD on my father's large tv.  What a great movie, pretty much all the acclaim laid upon it is well-deserved.  It is a perfect example of pure entertainment... and that's really the best way to put it: pure entertainment.  Among the usual comments about the direction, the music, and the characters, I'd like to chalk one up for the pacing.  The movie flows perfectly, and before I knew it, an hour and 15 minutes went by in what felt like half-an-hour.  That's what I call good pacing, as well as an engrossing story development, and give Spielberg his dues for that one.Nothing more to say other than it is deserving of the label 'classic.'",10,2,4,6 November 2000
