The Finest Hours," Excellent Action Movie
","If you want to watch an outstanding action movie suitable for all ages, this one deserves your attention. Based on actual events, it vividly demonstrates the courage of some people in life threatening situations and their ability to innovate during challenges. The well-written script and fine acting, plus excellent special effects, maintain interest in this character-based action adventure. Although very young children might have difficulty following the plot, the story would be suitable for all ages. It appears some of the film was shot on location. The film offers a rich visual background. It demonstrates the power of Nature in an impressive way. The story might raise the consciousness of Millennial audiences about the limitations of technology during some former historical periods. Some scenes in the film would not occur in the present era based on enhanced technology. The brief film offers a lot of excitement.",Null,1,2,25 December 2016
Fury," A Very Gritty Antiwar War Movie
","This superbly written film impressed me as perhaps the grittiest, hardest-to-watch war movie I've seen. It does embrace a lot of clich√©s surrounding the Greatest Generation, yet the writing makes the actions of the characters plausible. Well acted, well written and well directed, it offers riveting viewing.In order to prevail during the war, the officer in charge of a tank (played by Brad Pitt) and his men force themselves to view the world in very stark terms. The tank commander does not hesitate to commit violence to achieve his military objectives, even to the point of abandoning law sometimes. He compels a younger soldier joining his team to adopt this view, even though as the plot unfolds it appears the tank commander does subscribe to essentially the same value system as the younger man. The film suggests the ability to maintain an idealistic (and ethical) society perhaps ultimately rests upon the willingness to enforce the rules of a just society, something the Nazis has completely abandoned. The Allied forces found themselves meeting violence with violence. For instance, after capturing a German town the American tank commander asked a terrified municipal official to point out the German officer responsible for hanging children so his men could exact swift retribution.I thought the acting and special effects contributed to the overall effectiveness of the plot. 'Fury' displayed the cruelty of WWII against the backdrop of human foibles and strengths. It highlights both the senselessness of violence and its recurring role in arbitrating geopolitical affairs. One line from this movie particularly seemed to encapsulate its message: 'Ideals are peaceful, history is violent.' The closing scene vividly depicts the wastefulness and cruelty of warfare, while also acknowledging the critical role of individual acts of self-sacrifice and mercy in promoting survival.",Null,1,4,11 June 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Not Very Tolerant
","The premise that a science fiction character can be described by other characters in a movie as a figure misinterpreted by the people of previous eras as 'Yahweh' or 'RA' and that this super-powered being designated four comic-strip movie character followers to conduct evil deeds causing them to be mistaken for the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse doesn't show much concern for Judeo-Christian sentiments. Or for the accuracy of either the Old or New Testament current worldview (or ancient Egyptian religious beliefs, probably, for that matter). Does somebody hope to consign the Old Testament to the dustbin of history?Practicing Jews and Christians will likely find the movie's description of its own premise highly offensive. Radical thought guru, the late labor organizer Saul Alinsky advised students of societal change who wanted to disrupt belief systems to poke fun at your targets. Comic book characters are really funny from the perspective of little children. So we don't always notice when they compare our Deity to the sun god of the long gone Ancient Egyptians.A late comedienne once joked: 'How dare you pee on my roses and then have the nerve to tell me you just watered my lawn?' I think she understood Alinsky's views. Big budget films should not lend themselves to becoming Alinsky-style tools for desensitizing children to Old Testament ideas in my opinion, so I rated this film as a 3 (it probably should have been lower, but admittedly the special effects work).If you think its okay to belittle Judeo-Christian belief systems in this way, and to accustom your household to discussing Yahweh in obsolete terms, by all means take the grand-kids to see this big budget Hollywood production this summer. The next time they spend an hour or two in temple or church listening to religious texts, they can say 'Yahweh? Hey, I heard about that dude! He was on the X-Men!'",Null,28,55,28 May 2016
