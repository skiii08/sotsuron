Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," best action packed lucas film ever
","I really don't understand what the critics were complaining about. Sure, 'The Phantom Menace' was about a piddling trade dispute vs. saving the galaxy, but so what? It still had chills, thrills and effects enough to keep the most pessimistic viewer interested. We all know that it will develop into something MUCH more in the prequels to come.I thought Liam Neeson was absolutely amazing as QGJ: he seemed exactly what a Jedi Knight should be...wise, sombre...and disturbingly good looking. Eat your heart out Yoda!All in all, I think that the acting in the movie was great, and I especially liked Queen Amidala's character as the strong leader, willing to sacrifice for her people. So, I give it ***** out of ***** and I fervently hope that the next two STAR WARS films are as entertaining as 'The Phantom Menace'.",10,5,7,19 October 1999
