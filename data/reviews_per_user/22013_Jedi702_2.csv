The Blair Witch Project," *Whew*
","I got the opportunity to see this movie opening day in a packed movie theatre. What caught my eye was not only the movie, but the audience members whom I sat next too. They were abosoltuely captivated by this movie. As I was. I haven't been this scared for a long time. Usually movies that are of the 'suspense' genre are all to predictable. But Blair Witch Project had twist after twist. I felt so sorry for those three out in the middle  of the Maryland woods, far from food, far from water, and from hope. I actually left the movie shaking after the climatic end, that in my opinion was perfectly written, and shot. I won't spoil anything thing for those of you that havent seen BWP, but I highly suggest this for those of you that loved to have your very soul scared by this movie. One thing that should be included with this movie is warning label for the weak of heart.  I'm certainly going to see this one again!",8,1,1,31 July 1999
Trainspotting," I watched this movie seven times in two days...then my tape broke
","Today is a good day. First because I bought my *second* copy of Trainspotting. Second, because I bought the book today too. 'Trainspotting' is one of the few movies that holds me in my seat until the end. I first fell in love with this movie when I rented it from the local video store. I had seen bits and pieces of it before but when I finally saw it from start to finish, it took my breath away. I thought the cinematography was great but the acting, impeccable. MacGregor does a fine job as Rents, but  I think the show stealer was Robert Carlyle's electrifying job as Begbie. Begbie, by far my favorite character. I think Carlyle should've recieved more screen time. Also, another under-used character was Ewen Bremner's portrayal of Spud. I think everybody in this movie did a great job. The interaction between the contrasting characters was marvelous. Miller (Sick Boy) and Renton (MacGregor) have a real chemistry. Kudos also to Kelly Macdonald who burn up the screen during the nightclub scene. Overall Trainspotting is up there in my top three. A modern day classic to revered by all movie fans.",Null,0,0,1 May 1999
