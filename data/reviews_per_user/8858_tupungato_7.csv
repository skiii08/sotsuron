The Sound of Music," Still entertaining and a little bit moving
","I did not see The Sound of Music until maybe 15 years after its initial release. For some reason, my mother and father did not feel I should see the film. Did my parents think it too long and too slow for someone my age (nine years in 1965)? Did they consider the story and the film's style more suitable to girls and women than to boys and men? Did they fear that a situation or two might upset me? Maybe my parents recognized that while the movie did not include any scene truly scandalous or controversial, they did not think the subject matter would interest me. Whatever their thinking, I recall that this movie that I was discouraged from seeing had apparently created something of a craze across the nation. I remember clearly that in the town where I grew up elementary school teachers, during the 45 minutes devoted 3 times a week to chorus, led their students in singing songs from the Sound of Music's soundtrack, just as high school music instructors included elements of The Sound of Music in the annual On-Broadway production that 17 and 18 year-olds performed for any and all members of the community to attend.Julie Andrews, herself, had an impact on me, as she did on many other people, who seemed rather enamored of her. In addition to her cute looks, she projected a wholesomeness and innocence -- qualities embodied, not coincidentally, by both her Mary Poppins and Sister Maria characters -- which caused audiences to treat her more as a role model than as a movie star.Because of its powerful theme song and various other catchy tunes, awe inspiring cinematography, fine acting and an inoffensive script, light humor, and plot involving a significant historical event, The Sound of Music can give the impression of having been made during an earlier era. Despite all the straight-laced characters, however, The Sound of Music may have reflected the culture of the 1960's more than viewers realize.Sister Maria may not behave like a rebel, but she does show herself to be an individual, who recognizes her inner conflict and comes to realize that a life of devotion to God and many hours in meditation within the confines of a convent don't suit her. More notably, her mother superior, rather than reproach Sister Maria for feeling pulled by both the natural and human activity beyond the walls of the convent, encourages Sister Maria to heed her inner voice and to pursue the interests that fulfill her, even if that means forsaking a higher calling.",8,2,9,6 October 2009
Catch Me If You Can," Excellent
","This movie certainly entertains, but a viewer can find it as suspenseful as he does informative, touching, and powerful, given that such a con- artist, who deceived hospital administrators, airline pilots, and lawyers, and made the FBI look unprofessional and foolish, really did exist. Christopher Walken does a commendable job as Frank Abagnale Senior, the failed father who exudes irresponsibility and has a victim's ready excuse for his mistakes. Interesting to see how Frank Abagnale Junior (Leonardo DiCaprio), though he grows to see his father more clearly, deals with his hurt by acting out some of his father's antisocial behavior, becoming that of which he most disapproves in a parent. Frank Abagnale Jr. seems to have found the mentor he would have preferred in Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), the determined and ethical FBI agent who finally catches up to the fast-talking fraud.",10,1,2,21 May 2017
Dead Poets Society," Great film, few flaws
","Robin Williams demonstrates his versatility in this movie. He combines his talents as a comic -- the students appear to laugh spontaneously as he improvises and impersonates -- with a capacity to express seriousness, hurt, and even humility. He not only seems to understand very well his character, an inspirational and empathetic teacher with a counterculture approach in a school where the rest of the staff values discipline and tradition, but also to have a feel for classroom education. The young actors who play the parts of students complement Williams well. Williams does a convincing job as the unique educator who mentors as well as he teaches in part because his students come across very believably, whether taking risks with girls, trying to overcome shyness, masking fear with stubbornness, or struggling with a parent's disapproval.Only the situation involving Neil Perry's suicide, because of the script and not the performances, strikes me as unlikely, reminding me that I am watching fiction. Yes, teenagers have occasionally resorted to killing themselves when they feel rejected, unloved, or unsupported by the people most important to them, but Neil Perry's reaction to his father's rigidity still seems too extreme, just as his father's attitude seems too inflexible.I think I could have remained absorbed in the movie until the very end if Mr. Perry had responded to his son's successful theater debut with a tone of condescension and words such as, 'Now... you have had some fun as a dramateur, and that's all well and good, but your mother and I believe that it is time for you to become serious and practical about your future, as you and I have discussed.' Then Neil could have possibly reacted with resignation and some tears, or maybe could have avoided the trip home with his parents by hitching a ride and escaping into the city. He didn't have to shoot himself in the head. That act diminished rather than enhanced the believability of this story.",9,0,0,24 April 2011
Taxi Driver," Powerful but flawed
","To fairly review a movie from the 1970's, one must separate elements of that often ridiculed decade, such as fashion, hairstyles, technology, and jargon, from the story and the performances. S/he can't allow the plaid pants; broad-collared shirts; contrived sounding street talk; over-the-ears, less than natural, post-hippie era hair; or even the absence of I-pods and cell phones to keep him/her from directing his/her judgments only at the believability of the movie's plot and the acting.So... keeping the popular culture of that time in perspective, I think Taxi Driver deserves high marks in part because it helped to make people aware that a soldier usually returns from war (Viet Nam or any other) troubled, not simply relieved that he is no longer experiencing horror and motivated to transfer his work ethic to the home front. The movie reveals, too, that a veteran may not have caring parents and friends and a comfortable home to ease his transition (though the difference between the memories of explosions and screams and the calm of an office or store creates its own special stress); he may have to find his way alone.Taxi Driver succeeds, too, because of the acting. Robert De Niro, Cybill Shepherd, Jody Foster, Peter Boyle, and Harvey Keitel perform convincingly as the victims, degenerates, and survivors of a depraved New York City subculture. Only the FBI agents come across as a little typed.Taxi Driver doesn't score high in all areas, however. While the cast impresses, this starkly realistic story actually lacks in realism. In the climatic scene When Travis (Robert De Niro) rescues Iris (Jody Foster), by gunning down the miscreants who exploit her, he has carried out a rehearsed plan (he had purchased several firearms) motivated by an overpowering and unrelated rage as much as he has valiantly acted on his concern for this once innocent girl. The writers, as they should, make Sport (Harvey Keitel) and his buddies look like low-lifes, but when these men rebound growling and screaming from 38-caliber pistol blasts from point blank range they behave like zombies, not humans. During the outcome phase the less-than-likely events continue. Newspaper recognition of Travis Bickle's act seems plenty appropriate, but a police officer, FBI agent, or common citizen would have probably seen and commented on the similarity between the man in the newspaper photo and the mohawked character who drew attention to himself when he conspicuously fled the plaza where he had considered -- he pulled out a gun for many to see -- killing a senatorial candidate as he spoke to an audience of 500+.And not long after the newspaper makes the public aware of Bickle's courageous deed, he receives a letter from Iris's parents thanking him for saving their daughter. Like the newspaper story aspects of the letter rate it low on the probability scale. I can understand that such a letter would include the parents' gratitude and feelings of indebtedness toward the person who made possible the girl's return home. I don't accept, though, that the parents would also tell of their daughter's successful readjustment to her school routine and renewal of friendships. After the abuse that Iris weathered and the violence that she witnessed, she would suffer post traumatic stress that would rival that of the Viet Nam veteran's.",8,1,1,20 November 2012
Remember the Titans," Predictable But Very Enjoyable
","The person who assigns parts to actors always has a very important job, but his choices can become crucial in the case of a movie involving a sport. Miscasting in this kind of movie can subject some performers to ridicule and doom even the most thoughtful and well written story to mediocrity. In a story about a singer/musician, for example, the woman selected to play the part of the entertainer can learn the lyrics to various songs, sway and smile, engage an audience, move her mouth and her hands. She does not have to truly sing or play an instrument. Similarly, a man chosen to play the part of a United States president or well-known foreign leader can prepare by learning the significant events that took place during the ruler's reign, study his idiosyncrasies and mannerisms, and memorize important speeches - almost a natural task for an actor. He does not have to have ever held a government post as a prerequisite.I don't mean to imply that an actor with only community theater experience could easily play one of the above parts in a major motion picture, or that a person awarded for his performance in one of these roles would not deserve the recognition. The person who portrays an athlete might in some ways, in fact, have a less challenging job. But unlike the actor who plays the part of an entertainer or a politician (or who portrays a doctor, a priest, a teacher, a criminal, a soldier, a pilot, an explorer, or a lawyer, for that matter), the one who plays the part of an athlete has definite limits with respect to what he can pretend. He can't fake agility, coordination, a comfortable running style, a natural throwing motion or catching form; he must demonstrate skills beyond his acting.Remember The Titans moved and inspired me (despite a few scenes and some dialog that sort of manipulate a viewer's feelings) partly because the young men playing members of that football team not only swaggered, jostled, bantered, and jived like high school athletes, they also played like them. This movie benefits from equally impressive performances from the adults. Denzel Washington did a commendable job as Herman Boone, the demanding, domineering, yet fair head football coach, and Will Patton did tremendous work as the demoted head coach Bill Yoast, the mentor with the softer approach and rather folksy style, who must deal with the immaturity of his bigoted friends as well as his tendency to patronize the African American members of the team.",9,3,5,7 January 2009
Gangs of New York," OK (if you can get through it)
","Those who romanticize the lives of 19th century Americans and maintain Americana images of bustling city streets where innkeepers, aristocratic women carrying parasols, nannies, leather smiths, bankers, cobblers, bricklayers, market managers, and police officers (whose job involved no more risk than chasing down an occasional pickpocket)will have a hard time assimilating this version of U.S history. 'Gangs of New York' gives the impression that in 1860's New York City anarchy reigned and the antisocial predominated. Usually, movies that have characters that I would never want as neighbors also feature ones that I admire or envy, people who endure struggles and make decisions with which I empathize, but not this movie. It doesn't include any character I find likable - not even Leonardo DiCaprio's. I have to concede, however, that my feelings reflect to a degree the quality of the performances, since a viewer can't react with loathing and revulsion if the actors don't make themselves appear heinous and heartless. Daniel Day Lewis's acting, especially, affected me. As much as I wanted to put my arm around the flawed but generally decent man he portrayed in 'The Crucible,' I was hoping that someone would dismember 'The Butcher.' 'Gangs of New York' does deal with a very significant social-political issue, the strained relationship between the Irish and the English, but it can also frustrate because it does not teach much. If a viewer can withstand the many brutal killings and stay with the story to the finish, s/he will probably only have learned that when the Irish and English immigrated to this country they brought their mutual hatred with them.",6,0,1,25 July 2013
Jurassic Park," Hugely Successful Novel Works Well As A Movie
","Before the smaller, slender, more harmless looking Dilophosaurus turned aggressive, the Tyrannosaurus Rex lived up to its fierce reputation, and Dennis Nedry attempted to make off with the Barbasol can of dinosaur embryos, I had already watched my favorite scene. When Paleontologhist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), and the park creator's grandchildren, Lex and Tim Murphy (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello), first hiked through the park, looking in amazement as herds of swiftly running Gallimimuses, swooping pterodactyls, and plodding brachiosauruses appeared all about them, they reacted so appropriately that the action and suspense that followed felt a little anti-climatic. Astonished and wide-eyed, Lex and Tim Murphy innocently asked questions, and wise Dr. Grant imparted his knowledge when he wasn't shaking his head incredulously each time he saw another enormous, heretofore extinct reptile. The performances, images, script, and the scenes featuring the rampaging tyranasaurus as it thundered after the jeep or plucked a man from an outhouse toilet, all deserve very high marks. For me and possibly for other viewers, though, who as 8 year-olds had read about the brontosaurus, allosaurus, stegosaurus, and triceratops, and had played and pretended with little plastic versions of them, the makers of Jurassic Park had to present the first human-dinosaur encounter very believably. To me, they did.",9,1,2,10 December 2016
