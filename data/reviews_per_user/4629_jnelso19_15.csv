The Hangover," What Can I Say
","This movie is just funny beyond belief and wait for it, it actually has a decent script to add on to it (We're calling it a movie at the request of Mr. Todd Phillips). Now what made this film great wasn't the scenarios that the Wolf Pack got themselves into, even though they were hilarious, but it was the dialogue that lead us into, through, and out of Vegas. The dialogue was so creative and in the end was hilarious and is almost instantly quotable (at least it was back when it came out in 09). With that and a cast that basically made everyone rich particularly Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis, everything worked out. Much like every great movie that is marketable, it became the victim of a less then worthy sequel that wasn't written by Phillips and in the end will keep this film from being remembered as one of the best comedies of all time. Praying that this last sentence will be wrong but only time will tell.",10,1,2,30 December 2012
United 93," A Hard Topic to Tackle on the Big Screen
","One thing that can be mutually agreed upon for anyone who was sadly a part of this tragedy is that it's never the right time to make movies like this. Whether it's a movie about Pearl Harbor or the Rwandan Genocide, someone is going to be disturbed, upset etc. about the material portrayed on screen. So when Mr. Greengrass decided to make a film this early about 9/11 was going to shake some people up. Sadly to say, there is no need for spoilers for this film since we all know the sad ending for these people just trying to travel. Anyway, what makes this film great isn't the material that was presented but rather the taste that Greengrass used when presenting it. He contacted the victims families and worked with the ones that returned his calls in order to present the characters in the most realistic ways possible. You'll notice the biggest name in the cast is the man who played Tom Burnett who won an Emmy for Boston Legal. This makes the film all the better, you can see where these actors could easily be one of us. Something that Oliver Stone failed to do with World Trade Center. Greengrass also did a great job by simply replaying the events as they unfolded instead of creating a faux storyline to throw in (even though the German character was more than likely exaggerated to say the least). He brought in the people who were actually there and had them tell their story rather then hiring a bunch of actors to just guess. Hell it gave one person an opportunity to work in Hollywood in the future (watch the Green Zone and you'll see who exactly it was). Even then, Greengrass used his Bourne style of filmmaking to keep us at the edge of our seats. You know how the film ends before it even begins and you still believe that things will turn for the better. That's all Greengrass and if it wasn't for The Departed, Babel and the 5 film rule, this would've been nominated for an Oscar. Just a great film that could've been treated with a lot less respect, considering that it was not written by an American (Greengrass is British to those that don't know), but it was treated with all the respect that these heroes deserve.To All Haters: This film isn't meant to do anything more then just tell a story. Unlike Michael Moore who has a blatant liberal agenda (and an extra hundred lbs. he can afford to lose, politics and his lawsuits aside), Greengrass just wants to show what happened on 9/11, no more no less. This is something that should be appreciated in a Hollywood where an agenda is always evident (no matter what issue, but there's always one). RIP to all those lost on 9/11. No time passed, war, or movie can bring back those lost so the best thing we can do as humans is to learn from history and try and better ourselves as a race.",9,1,2,1 January 2013
Gravity," A Team Effort That Must Be Seen in Theaters
","One thing that has been missing in these big blockbuster films in this day and age is the ability to have a solid story and merge it with A- List talent and extraordinary technology (Enter multiple blockbusters here). This wasn't the case for Alfonso Cuaron and despite the years spent in production hell, the payoff was extraordinary. Using his ability to make long takes work in his favor (Children of Men for those who haven't seen it) he makes what could have been a disaster and turned it into cinema gold that doesn't make you feel stupid for spending money on it. Along with Cuaron's incredible directing abilities, there was the extraordinary acting of Sandra Bullock and a briefly seen yet meaningful George Clooney.As A-Lister's should, they carry the film in ways very few people can and I'm no Hollywood insider, but I can imagine that the films $100 million budget was significantly inflated hiring those two and it was worth it. As Dr. Stone, Bullock performs with her usual excellent acting and because of it, we all relate to her in this film. Someone who has to fight to survive in an environment that you never truly prepare for (Disaster), granted her character is in a situation only few can honestly understand but she represents more than those people. Her character, one can argue, represents the everyday person who has to do whatever they can so they can get home,it's someone who has to deal with work B.S. or someone who deals with issue after issue when all they want to do is complete their day. Dr. Stone is someone you can relate to and that's to the credit of Cuaron and Bullock in making that happen which comes to the biggest thing in films and in life in general (I'll explain that later). Then there's the graphics.The graphics of this film is to say the least incredible and because of it, makes it one of the very few films that actually deserved the 3-D treatment. The best way to describe it would be to compare it to watching an IMAX documentary about space that's in 3-D it's that realistic. It's one of those Avatar type films that you have to see in theaters in order to truly enjoy the film. The details that were taken into account to make this movie as real as possible really is the deal breaker because if it wasn't considered, the film would be at best average which comes to the only flaw in the film, the script itself.The story itself is not really anything to ride home about as it can be considered predictable and there are a few things you wish were avoided, but it still doesn't take away from the film itself (Much like Avatar). Then there are the theoretical life lessons this movie brings by having you be a part of Dr. Stone's journey and yes, it's Dr. Stone's journey not Clooney's (even though his performance should not be discounted as he did a hell of a job). All of these things lead to the film that is Gravity which brings this review to a full circle.When you make a film, it has to be a team effort, if not it's going to a disaster of epic proportions. You can scrap a script together put a couple A-List actors in it and let the rest of it go (Battleship is an example granted only Liam Neeson is A-List but that's not the point). But if you want to really make it work, you have to have a quality director, quality script and quality actors if you want to make it work. That's exactly what happens here and because of it, we're now given a film that could be a strong Oscar contender despite being a film that is usually anything but and that's to the credit of Cuaron, Bullock, Clooney and everyone who made it happen.",9,5,9,21 October 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Not Another Tarantino Classic
","Despite the name for this review expecting the contrary, this is a fair explanation regarding the quality of Q's twisted look on WWII. Like all of his films in the past, he has a great script paying homage to the films that inspired him to move into Hollywood instead of becoming a serial killer (Thank the good Lord above). He also help bring performances from people who never would've been noticed otherwise (Christoph Waltz is the main benefactor). Not to mention he had enough action to not only keep the people who enjoy the Michael Bay IQ droppers entertained, but he had a screenplay that keep you on the edge of their seats. Something that is very simple yet very rare in film. Not to mention it can only be done by the best ( I don't count Spielberg because he over does these things one way or another.) Q not only keeps you entertained with simple American pleasures (booms and bangs) he entertains you mentally with a screenplay. Q did it again and it's a shame because this film, like Pulp Fiction, got caught in a weird Oscar year and if it came out either the year or two after it originally did, it not only would've swept all the categories, it wouldn't have been close.",10,1,4,23 December 2012
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," It's South Park
","First thing's first, I'm a huge fan of the show (have seen every episode at one point in time or another), so the natural bias on this film will be evident. Second I was thinking of a title to call this review and the other was going to either the one above or 'This Cartoon Isn't Meant for Children' because that was actually written at a local video store that is surprisingly still in business (Shout out to Village Video in Hickory, MD by the way). But I digress again, as per usual Trey Parker and Matt Stone got them kids in Colorado in a sticky situation where they change the course of history. Much like the show, nothing changes, the kids are smart, the adults are stupid, and anything wrong socially was pointed out in hilarious ways (such as the very racist Operation: Human Shield). But much like the combo's other works, the musical numbers are funny and catchy at the same time. Plus, bringing in Saddam into play in this film was excellent and knowing that some soldiers from the Army's 4th Infantry Division showed it to him repeatedly in prison makes it all the better. But hey who cares about that because as they say in the film 'Horrific, Deplorable violence is okay, as long as people don't say any naughty words. That's what this war is all about.'",10,0,0,31 December 2012
American Beauty," Definitely Deserving of The Oscars
","Unlike many films that won Oscars, this one was one of the more worthy films to win. Not to mention the fact it beat out The Green Mile and The Sixth Sense and it's still considered worthy makes it all the better. What makes this film great is that it's not only a statement on the American Middle Class but it's a classic underdog story. Kevin Spacey does his job with expertise as a man who wants more out of life and will do anything to feel new. Some people call that a mid-life crisis, this films shows it as something else. ....Look Closer (See what I did there). Even Annette Bening did as solid job playing as a prude of sorts who demands perfection and will get it anyway possible. Granted the script isn't the greatest in the world (Magnolia should've won in that category) it fit well into what Sam Mendes wanted and in the end, you got an excellent film with great acting and a message that tells people to not look at what you see at face value whether it's for a family, a business or kids at a high school.",9,0,2,29 December 2012
Django Unchained," Should've Been Made Years Ago
","(Note: This is a rewrite of a review that respectively was poorly written and didn't truly convey my emotions of this film. So as the Bud Light people say, Here We Go.) I officially saw this film twice in the theaters and so far my reactions are the same. This film is a work of art and I repeat a work of art. Not since The Departed has a film literally had everything in a bag of potato chips. Tarantino found a way to not only throw his normal crap in, (violence and such but we'll get to that later.) but he did with respect to the historical reality that was Pre-Civil War treatment of slaves. Was there a loads of racial slurs thrown around like the bullets throughout the film, no doubt, but guess what people, that's the way it was. Sadly to say, our nation's wealthiest people back then treated slaves like they did in this film and in some cases worse then portrayed. The fact Tarantino didn't go deeper shows the respect he has for his moviegoers by not turning this thing into a Schindler's List, which he could've easily done. Another thing he did that was impressive was turning Jamie Foxx's Django from an uneducated tortured slave into one of the most necessary characters in film. Not a black hero (that's been done before) but a server of justice that couldn't be done in a real world scenario. Something that I would hope even the likes of Al Sharpton and Spike Lee would appreciate (Oh wait they can't get away from the fact that Tarantino made the script real to the times).In regards to the highlights, aside from the script the acting was excellent all around. Leo played a great ruthless plantation owner and Waltz was equally great as Django's mentor. Both of them could easily get the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor this year and in fact they were both so good it will probably give Tommy Lee Jones the win due to the divide it will cause. Plus Samuel L. playing as the stereotypical Uncle Tom was great as well, and I know it's great because I didn't enjoy it as much as my fellow African-American moviegoers did. There are so many other great performances that are great but I can't even mention right now because there are so many but now we have to address the haters.To All Haters: You all have a right to your opinion, but take the following arguments out before you make a statement. 1. The violence: It's done on purpose, Tarantino has a knack of using a lot of corn syrup during his films and this case there was enough to throw a kickin Halloween party. But to those that say this is wrong and it causes shootings and things like that (Someone actually said that Hmm), read into the tragedies and then make statements like this cause if you really want to say He's partially responsible for Aurora, then blame Christopher Nolan for the kid being inspired by The Dark Knight (read some stuff and you'll understand). 2. Racism: To anyone who believes this film is racist should join the Spike Lee club for Complete Separationist. Like what was said earlier, N word used a lot, straight up, but anyone with a brain could see Tarantino if anything was doing a nasty stereotype on the South. He portrayed the Southern Slaveowners as generally uneducated and ones that couldn't even do a raid right (that scene was hilarious by the way). Also if Samuel L. Jackson (who was a former member of the Black Panthers, look it up) was willing to be in it then it can only be so bad. Final Analysis: This film maybe long, but it sure as hell didn't feel like it to me and that's always a plus. It's worthy of multiple views and that's a plus and even though it's over-the- top, it's over-the-top with class and that's something that should not only be appreciated in the future but it should be taught to other directors (Michael Bay maybe). Plus this film has an equal balance of humor, violence, drama, and suspense which in the end should be enough. So if you're not a prude, come on in, sneak in a snack before you enter the theater, and enjoy the Best Film of 2012 and it's not even close.",10,5,15,30 December 2012
The Bourne Legacy," The Seven is Just Being Nice
","As a fan of the Bourne Trilogy (yes I'm standing by it, this film was that disappointing) I thought this film was another excuse just to make bank on the Bourne name before it became stale (Ultimatum was released in 2007 so it pushed the line). So when my father (the man who helped make me a fan of the series) asked me to see this with him, I was concerned about what I was going to see out of respect for him. Of course almost two hours later and they proved my theory to be correct and the list of flaws are endless. First off the plot. Overall, the story itself wasn't that bad as it tells how the government recovered from the last film. Then we see Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) doing his thing and sadly, it doesn't make a lick of sense. It's obvious who he is but what he's doing and his interactions are poorly written at best. His story line was going in the right direction but like the rest of this film, just when things are going somewhere it falls flat. When he makes progress with his journey, it falls flat. Everything just falls flat. To give it credit, the connection with Rachael Weisz's character even makes sense and heck even how they ran into each other makes sense but unlike the films that precedes this one, it never picks up. Then comes the action, the action sequences were average at best, none of the scenes were really intense with the exception of Matt Fewer's scene. This is what kept the last films as good as they were, once you saw Damon in action, you know it was for real.Now the supporting characters, what made the Bourne trilogy so special was that the supporting characters were as well written and performed as Jason Bourne himself. This film like the last three followed the formula to the T. Ed Norton and Stacey Keach performed excellently as the government side of the show (we'll pretend that Norton didn't help give Keach this job due to American History X). Oscar Issacs did a good job as the Clive Owen of the film. Rachael Weisz, however, didn't perform as well as the rest of the crew and either it was from poor writing or just chemistry but it was obvious something was missing. But going back to the plot the characters just never seemed to connect and just when a breakthrough happens, the door closes and some no sense door opens which for me anyway ticked me off.In conclusion, I don't want to say I'm shocked because of all the turmoil that made this movie happen. With Greengrass never being on board and Damon not being on board without Greeengrass, the signs were evident. Of course not wanting to disappoint a Studio Head, the film was green lighted anyway and it showed with the obviously rushed script. Even with the great performers in this film and the original Bourne director. Disaster couldn't be avoided and the only reason why this is a 7 and not a failure is that this film did go in the right direction and the effort was shown despite the disadvantages from the start.",7,0,7,30 March 2013
The Hurt Locker," A Well Deserving Winner in a Strong Year.
","Much like American Beauty, this film was very much deserving of the multiple Oscars it won back in 2010 and even though people question it on account of Inglorious Basterds and Avatar coming out that year (Both were excellent films but one was definitely more worthy then the other, *cough* not James Cameron *cough*), this film earned it's keep. We'll start at the beginning, from the start of the film to the end, it was suspenseful and at the very least Bigelow kept us at the edge of our seats. With each bomb diffusion that was shown, you couldn't leave because you never knew when bombs were going to go off and how. The acting and directing was excellent with the highlights coming from Jeremy Renner who had a career changing performance (remember how his highlight was the turncoat in S.W.A.T. before this film). Anthony Mackie and the other guy did a hell of a job as the team who has to deal with Renner along with them coming to terms with a loss (to avoid spoilers I won't tell you who and when it takes place). The only flaw that can be pointed out is some of the realism that could be missing in regards to how soldiers handle themselves in war time locations and the procedures that they follow regarding situations like this. Saying that, until I contact my cousin (served two tours in Iraq and was wounded twice, one was ironically from a car bomb. By the way, God bless him and all who serve to allow us to write about things we love), my opinion of this film will not change.",9,1,3,30 December 2012
A Clockwork Orange," One That Was Made Way Ahead of It's Time
","Considering that this film is still considered intense even in times where The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Piranha are released, it shows how far Kubrick looked forward to in this film. Of course anyone who is a cinephile, (aka those who write reviews on here. haha) knows of Stanley Kubrick and his historically relevant habit of pushing the button (his filmography till the day he dies is Exhibit A). It didn't stop after 2001 and is in fact pushed to the point where it became a major X Factor in film (get it? haha). Yet as button pushing films come and go (Human Centipede just popped in my head as I'm writing this), one could asked why this one is Etch a Sketched in our brains. Answer: It's real. Whether it describes how cruel humans can be to one another to how they try to have absolute control on things they can't and when they fail how they try to pick things up. This film not only describes human nature, but it describes it in a way anyone who can handle the more sexually explicit and violent scenes can think and say 'Yeah this has been done in real life before.' If you can do that and still make a film solid through great acting, writing and directing. Then you have a winner, sadly the Academy didn't think so and the history of them getting things wrong continued (Sorry Gene Hackman, The French Connection didn't deserve to win.)",10,1,3,23 December 2012
Pulp Fiction," Still Great After a Near 20 years Later
","For lack of a better word, this film is Genius. A film that has an excellent combination of action, drama, comedy with great performances that any real fan of Tarantino or this movie can quote on a dime. Forget about the fact that it revived the careers of many actors including John Travolta and a Post-Hudson Hawk Bruce Willis or it's notable impact on today's cinema (Catch .44 is one of the numerous failed attempts of catching the magic). Tarantino found a way to not only keep us intrigued for a solid two and a half hours (something not a lot of directors can do these days). But he did it the same way Seinfeld did for almost 10 years (with a lot more balls too, anyway.) He made you care about Vincent Vega, The Wallace's, Jules Winfield and the many supporting characters who have literally made careers for people (Eric Stoltz Exhibit A) that in real life would be scorn and condemned. Q as a fan of creative films, I thank you. As someone who still believes a fresh movie still exist, Thank You. More importantly for influencing pop culture as a whole, Thank You.",10,0,2,23 December 2012
The Departed," Love It When a Plan Comes Together
","Yea that's right, I made an A-Team reference regarding The Departed. Despite the quality differences between these media stories, this film went exactly as planned. So when Brad Pitt and his production company Plan B decided to help remake a Chinese classic, they decided to go all out. Aside from getting the great Martin Scorsese on board to direct and William Monahan to write an excellent script, they felt like it wasn't enough. They hired Leo and an All-Star cast that could only be matched by a corny romantic comedy (Valentine's Day). Then as they say, the rest worked out itself. The acting was superb with Leo leading the way along with Mark Wahlberg, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson not far behind. Not to mention the ten other actors who did their jobs well and when it was all said and done. Mr. Scorsese didn't get denied and he finally won his Oscar. Plus he found his new De Niro with Leo and with this and Shutter Island, the future looks bright as long as Scorsese is still kicking.",10,2,2,23 December 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," Ten Years in the Making
","So we'll get this out of the way now so we don't have any miscommunication. If you still firmly believe that 9/11 was 100% the work of the US government, as in they set charges in the towers, they killed everyone on United 93, then don't watch this film because this is not for you. Now to the film. Much like The Hurt Locker, it was an excellent film with great acting writing and directing. But before we go into the film and it's positives and negatives (and it's lacking of them), let's close our eyes and take a ride down memory lane (Please picture this as rough as it was). 11 years ago, our nation was changed forever by deliberate and disgusting attacks that not only put an unfair stereotypes to Muslim's everywhere, but it also killed about 3,000 people around the time a normal person becomes productive at work (10:28 A.M. to be exact). People jumped to their deaths, people lost family, friends and people were taken from this world way to soon. Now open your eyes and watch the film knowing that you know the ending without even seeing the film (if you don't you're an idiot). Ms. Bigelow does a great job introducing us into the film without any visuals and it allowed you vision the things yourself. Something anyone could consider chilling, which shows her skill as a director to bring the audience in. Then the hunt begins, as the film progresses through our hunt. She reminds us on why America keep hunting and the attacks in between 9/11 and the day of justice. Along with that, she, with the help of a solid script by Mark Boal, showed the politics and the pain that was getting the plans in motion. With that we get to know the people who helped make it happen. We meet Maya, who is played wonderfully by Jessica Chasatain, who if in another world, would be a great as a homicide detective. We see her changed as time progressed. Along with her is great performances by a solid supporting cast. Jason Clarke plays a great CIA agent who has his fair share of great moments as he mentors her in the ways of hunting terrorists in the good ways and the bad. Jennifer Ehle does a great job as her closest friend in the agency. Plus with good brief performances by Tony Soprano, Michael from Lost, Mark Strong, Edgar Ramirez and even Mark Duplass from FX's The League. Not a lot was wrong with it, even the interrogation techniques and the politics that made you either uncomfortable or angry or both. But what makes this film great isn't the story itself, but the feeling of it.Bigelow doesn't make this film anything more then what it its, a honest portrayal of history. It isn't a right wing rah rah piece of American propaganda nor is it a left wing Michael Moore selfish anti-government video that was made just to make money (even though it was made for that reason, anyway). She wants us to feel what those people felt and it worked like a charm. You couldn't feel happy, you couldn't feel sad, which brings up the final part of this review.No matter what kind of film or thing that is done regarding 9/11, it can't bring back the lives lost that day or after that day. So the best thing we can do is learn from past mistakes (mistakes that continue throughout the film a.k.a politics) and learn from them and bring everyone responsible to justice whether it's in court or Seal Team Six style. That's what Bigelow expressed in a great way, she showed how far we went to get to the prize and what prices we paid to make it happen. The only flaw was that the film was predictable but then again we all knew the story when we went in, we just wanted details.For those who were uncomfortable with the content. Yes, this film shows torture at it's finest and respectably, much like Django, it will make people uncomfortable. Like Django, you got to keep it in perspective, remember what happened on 9/11 and every attack after that. Is it wrong, maybe (personally I didn't have a problem with it but then again I'm not everyone), but was it the right thing given the circumstances and knowing what's at stake. Hell Yeah. On that note enjoy the film and let's not forget what was lost and what it takes to bring justice to those who want to kill our friends and family. If you remember that you'll understand it. Bonus Points: Seal Team Six performers were solid as well, particularly Chris Pratt from Moneyball, that man has a future to say the least.",9,20,44,12 January 2013
12 Years a Slave," A Necessary Film That'll Test You
","As an self-professed cinephile, I followed this film in it's pre-production days and at the least, knew it was going to have potential. The story itself is pretty self explanatory. A man living the perfect life (or as much as a black man can in the 1840's) gets screwed over in the worst way possible and gets sold into slavery. Of course, with a story like that, you need the right director to properly tell it. Enter Steve McQueen, a soon to be known director who before this film, was really known by film critics and fanatics for his some could argue Oscar snubbed work with Michael Fassbender (Shame and Hunger). Also, these groups of people knew exactly what was coming of it if they saw his films as well. With his history of showing the dark realities of the taboo, you knew this was going to be a Tour De Force. Then you watch the movie and everything changes.When you get into the movie, everything changes. What was once a man living the dream (so to speak) turns into what can best be described as 1800's hell. In that hell comes the story of survival that is 12 Years A Slave and with it comes to the actors and incredible story telling that takes us on a ride that quite simply makes the work of Django Unchained soft and yes I use the word soft.In this hell, are the participants in the world and each one makes an incredible impression. Chiwetel Ejiofor, who before this was more known for his brief performances in Inside Man and Children of Men, pulled the performance of a lifetime and through the directing, put yourself into the journey of Solomon Northup. Through each lashing, each tear, each moment of survival, you wanted him to live and for that Ejiofor will be marked down for a performance that should be in the ranks of the greats in the past. Then comes the supporting crew around him that wasn't Brad Pitt (who coincidentally was the only good white man in the movie). The brief performances by Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano and even Benedict 'Khan' 'Julian Assange' 'Sherlock Holmes' Cumberbatch were all incredible and with the highlight performance from Michael Fassbender (we'll get to his character later), they helped provide a perfect picture of how white's treated slaves without really pulling any punches (like anyone could anyway since quite simply, the treatments were all accurate). As for the slaves, each one played their part but the highlights come from the actress who played Patsey. As a hardworking slave who had the biggest interactions with Fassbender's character, she knocks it right out of the park. You have no choice but to sympathize for her character and what makes it worse is the ultimate knowledge that she'll never get out unless death follows. Then comes Fassbender and his role of Epps. His character was at the very least complicated and one that despite all the screwed up stuff he does, you somewhat sympathize with him. How is that? Watch his interactions with his wife, Patsey and his facial expressions throughout the film. It really goes beyond the Calvin Candie slave owner and the fact you could possibly sympathize with him (I did and I hated myself for it) shows the incredible job that was done by both McQueen and Fassbemder into making it happen. Then there's the work behind the scenes.The work behind the scenes in this movie was the most remarkable part of this film. The way Steve McQueen tells the story with the assistance of his film editor and cameraman was nothing short but extraordinary. Each scene had you by the heart and was willing and able to pull it out at anytime and it's all because of them. With the noose scenes, the whippings, and the words spoken, all had an impact and because of it, lead to the amazing film that put every white man into a purgatory of sorts to reflect on this dark period in history. This was all credit to the people behind the scenes and if justice is truly just. They'll all win Oscars in the months ahead.Overall, no more needs to be explained about the film and it was incredible work done by everyone involved. Saying that, the film is a lot bigger than just an incredible film and in a way, was more necessary than any movie regarding slavery ever. As a white man watching this film, I knew what was coming of it and even though I was prepared, I was tested. It dared me to watch the hell that was presented on screen and take it as a history lesson and because of it, I'm a better person before I entered the movie which comes to the Jerry Springer-esque rant that's coming (Giving you the heads up if you want to turn back now).One universal truth that is accepted along with gravity and death is that we can never take the past back. What has happened happened and whether we want to change it or not, it's not going to change what was dealt. As for slavery, not until much recently, was a very taboo subject in American History other than just a section admitting that it happened. No one wanted to touch, no one felt entitled touch it, no one respectively had the guts to touch it.A modern take was not only needed, but required in a time of much change in this nation's history. With the death of Trayvon Martin and films released such as Django Unchained and the very liberally biased The Butler, a film really needed to bring the subject matter in the Mel Gibson style light that it deserved. In order to educate, you need an objective, realistic and in this case, a non-American (McQueen is British) look at the material so only the truth is shown. That's exactly what happened.",10,1,3,1 December 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," Better Late Then Never
","Along with Q and Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead original writer) and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood Powerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an American Classic. The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely made it's money back in US theaters (which is usually a signal for a film to turn into a DOA when released at home) and it made such a splash, that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple 18 years ago. This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including EW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late '94. Yet over time, this story of redemption, like the rise of hope this film gives from beginning to end, grows on you to the point where at the very end, you have no choice but to clap (I clapped in my basement in front of my parents and I haven't looked the same since). Darabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films. He made Robbins human, made Morgan Freeman's voice as American as a Big Mac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again. The only regret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two years later it would've swept away the Oscars (Sorry Ralph Fiennes, The English Patient won on a weak year.)",10,9,14,23 December 2012
