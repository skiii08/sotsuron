Skyfall," M is Bond Girl
","oh god, M is everywhere and i thought Bond will in bed with her. Too many M and Bond drama in this movie. This is ridiculous, pick wrong romance with old lady: - At M house at night, - Private escape, - Sit in front seat of car, I confuse between girlfriend or employer, - Enjoying landscape, talking pastIf M die earlier by shot or bomb explosion she would die in dignity. SÃ©verine is incredible hot but die faster, I can't believe a Bond girl without any gun action. Moneypenny is not attractive but keep appear in scene for no reason, she has no body shape at all as seen at the end of movie.",5,18,38,2 November 2012
