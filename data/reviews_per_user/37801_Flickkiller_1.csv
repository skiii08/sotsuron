Kill Bill: Vol. 2," 8.2 you've got to be kidding
","Usually a director would get to at least his fifties before he forgot how to make a movie. Like so many wunderkind this guy reads too much of his own press. The extended dialogues of his earlier work at least had some original thoughts. This film is laced with clichÃ©s and generic characters. I didn't like the first one but it at least had some interesting and different film styles. This one plods on like a wounded animal just waiting to be shot. Who cares if she kills him or not. The fight scenes are good but like a Hong Kong action film you have to suffer though endless dialogue. And this film is nowhere near as cool as he thinks it is. Don't waste your time, this is a dried up husk with nothing to offer it's audience.",2,3,8,2 January 2005
