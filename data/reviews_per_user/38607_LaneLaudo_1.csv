Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Fantastic, but flawed
","Sherlock Holmes a game of shadows was a very different film than it's predecessor, Sherlock Holmes (2009). While reviewing Sherlock Holmes a Game of Shadows, I will be reviewing it in a much different way than typical movie reviews. I am neither a professional movie review nor a want to professional movie reviews. Below is my review of the ending or Sherlock Holmes a Game of Shadows.The plot is very interesting, however, the resolution, or perhaps the ending of the film is not as in depth as the previous Sherlock Holmes. While the plot was, in my opinion, very interesting and more in-depth than the majority of movies that have come out recently, it was lacking compared to the first. Sherlock Holmes a Game of Shadows builds up the viewer's hope of Sherlock once again being the smartest man, and also solving and perhaps putting a man behind bars in the process. When the movie is nearing its end (SPOILER) Sherlock Holmes falls into, or off, a waterfall with the Professor, undoubtedly killing the professor and Sherlock Holmes. Then minutes later, we see Sherlock Holmes alive and well, while Dr. Watson believes he is dead. We see Watson get a package; it is the breath tool (I don't know what to call it) thus meaning that Holmes must have lived (a reference to a previous scene in the film). At this, I was left wondering how in the world he survived the fall of the waterfall? Yes, there was water below, but from that height, hitting water is like hitting concrete. If he didn't die (which he would), he would have had at least broken bones, or have been knocked out. While he did have oxygen, thus he didn't drown, he would have frozen. After all there was snow on the ground and it was snowing out. He would have died of hypothermia, or frozen to death some other way. He would have died. Lets face it. There is a 0% chance of any human surviving fall, let alone the climate outside. However, I did like this ending. I didn't wait Holmes to die, so I was relieved to see that he didn't! I personally am excited to see the Third Sherlock Holmes, when or if it comes out. This was a phenomenal film!",9,0,1,30 November 2013
