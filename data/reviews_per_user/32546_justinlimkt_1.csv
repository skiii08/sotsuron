The King's Speech," A great movie ! and a small change I have noticed
","I must give credit to Colin Firth for his great ability to act and to impersonate the late King George VI's speech. This credit goes to all the other crew who have made this production possible with perfect backdrop of that era.However, upon watching this movie the second time, I noticed something that is not-so-synchronizing - and this could be best noticed if one happens to watch this again. Where the Queen brought the then 'Prince Albert Frederick George' to consult Dr. Logue for the very first time, Dr. Logue offered him to make a recording on a Silvertone Phonograph. The recording which reads 'So How Can I hear what I am saying?' at 27:13, 32:32 he replays the record, and that phrase 'So How Can I hear what i am saying' he had a short pause between SO---HOW (at stammer).Just a small thing which I noticed but it does not at all affect the fineness and quality of this movie.",9,0,1,29 January 2011
