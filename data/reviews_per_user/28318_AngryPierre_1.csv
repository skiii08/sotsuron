Who Framed Roger Rabbit," They just don't make movies like this any longer.
","'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is one great movie. One reason I absolutely love it is because the animation was all done by hand. Now, cartoons mixed with real life are all done by computer. Secondly, the acting is awesome. The actors really made the characters come to life. They really convince you that they are interacting with the toons. The most prominent reason as to why I really like this movie is because the humor is absolutely genius. There's a good mix between children's jokes and a sort of risqu√© comedy.Overall, this is my favorite animated feature, maybe even my favorite movie of all time. I can watch it over and over again and the humor is just as fresh as the first time I watched it.",10,3,3,14 August 2003
