Vertigo," Power of Infatuation
","A masterpiece for sure.James Stewart plays retired police officer Scotty who suffers from vertigo after having chased a guy on a roof.Finding time difficult to spend, Scotty takes up an offer from an old friend to tail his wife Madeleine who is suicide-prone.From first glance Scotty is infatuated with the woman, with disastrous consequences.For those of you who have not seen this movie, I shall not spoil two very memorable hours.Let is be said however that Vertigo will go down in history as THE movie on a man´s ominous infatuation with a woman.The audience immediately understands that here there will not be a happy end. Like a Greek drama, Scotty is pushed towards the cliff, there being no turning back.Don´t ask me how but there is a surrealistic touch to this film that keeps the audience in suspense from the start (the music is wonderful).If you were to see only one more film in your life, Vertigo is it.",10,4,4,13 December 1999
The Sound of Music," As sweet as it gets
","It is impossible not to like this film even though you may want to choke at the cuteness.This film is worth seeing especially for the beautiful music. The plot is not very advanced however and I fail to see cinematic need to bring in the Nazis.If you want to feel happy, then watch Sound of Music.",Null,0,5,25 February 1999
