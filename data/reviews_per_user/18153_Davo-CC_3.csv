The Blair Witch Project," Simplicty, brillance, effectiveness - a deadly combination
","The Blair Witch Project is, in my humble opinion, a masterpiece of clever use of minimal resources, hype, selective leakage of information and superb disinformation that made a film that cost a pittance into a spectacular success.  It did this not by trying to defy its humble origins but indeed it played on them in the most effective way;  it used its amateur feel and low budget appearance to make it look all the more real and this was backed up by hyping people into believing that it was indeed real (at least for a time).Even when they realised that they had been `duped' so to speak they were intrigued (as was I) to find how this had been done to so many people so effectively.  The film came out very late in Australia (so we could cop the 2nd hand prints from the US) but I had purchased it on DVD from the US about two months before its theatrical release and had read a great deal about it and the hype surrounding it before even I saw it.It was intriguing to note the trickle of broken information that made it even here, others had heard this or that about this new film and many even believed it to be real - the thing was everyone wanted to see it very badly.Not everyone who saw it was effected by it - some didn't get it, some didn't like it, some weren't scared by it (one friend of mine borrowed the DVD and she watched it at midday with the lights all on and the windows open cuddled up with her border collie on the sofa;  she deliberately tried to minimise the scare impact, I tend to show it with all the lights off and around midnight!).Others had heard too much real information for the hype to have worked properly - but that's ok, I watched the film to see what they had tried to do and how they had tried to do it and I was enormously impressed by how someone took what they had and used simplicity and ingenuity to make something work so well.This is a film that is special in many ways, like Orson Wells' radio play of `War of the Worlds' and even Ghostwatch (1992) on the BBC, this film can lull the viewer into a sense of what they are seeing is real and even if you know it isn't in the proper environment it can still send chills down one's spine and leave the shattered illusions in their mind for days afterwards. It works on a minimalist approach not widely seen for a long time and they do it very very well;  indeed this was the first DVD I ever purchased and it is still one of my favourites.Not only is it a different type of horror film - it's a different type of film all together (from almost everything else I've seen) and in this day and age of repetition that's quite an achievement.It's a shame the sequel was just so bloody awful, it had none of the feeling or atmosphere of the original.",10,2,3,3 November 2003
American Beauty," Worth everything you give it - and then some.
","Sometimes you can tell how well a film is effecting its audience by the way that people respond in the theatre.  Moments of depth and meaning sometimes transcend the ability of those who lead a more pointless and shallow existence or who simply aren't paying attention. You can tell these people easily sometimes;  they laugh when they are not supposed to laugh because they are totally missing the point of what they are seeing;  and in this case a film so accessible and so understandable as this one further highlights the fact that they are sadly looking right past what they are seeing.The packed cinema in which I saw this flim was such a place, there were pockets of these pointless individuals here and there;  people who totally missed the point of what they were seeing and saw only the surface of the fact.  That this happened in American Beauty really hammers home just quite how deprived these people were.  This is neither a difficult nor an obscure film, nor is it detached from its audience;  in fact it's a long time since I've seen something that was so immersive, so involving and so compelling. Indeed The Sixth Sense was a film of such quality but in a totally different way so perhaps comparisons are a tad unfair in this case.This is a film of great depth, character and meaning which elegantly conveys its depth and communicates with its audience in a careful, considered  and very thoughtful manner.  This sense of depth is felt throughout the entire film and is cemented in the last few scenes, the point of the entire story is given with such clarity that it is hard to misunderstand what you are seeing.I think everyone will perhaps pick up something different from this film based on how it relates to them and their own experience.  It will speak volumes to some, quiet whispers to others;  it will nudge and prod and suggest to some people who have been there, done that, others will just find it an interesting and deep story that stays with you long after you've left the cinema.  I think that the elegance of this film is in its simplicity and the way that a profoundly simple concept is explored and concentrated into the final point in the film, something that not only requires truly great writing but equally strong production, direction and last but not least, very strong performances.I found all these things in this film and I was swept up in its brilliance, its simplicity and indeed its complexity.  Not only is it so clever as to be very intellectually impressive but it also achieves a level of accessibility that it may be understood by almost everyone.  I now pity those who miss this film or those who see it but still miss all that is in it;  those who want to look at pretty pictures and disengage their brain for a while had best not see this film.  They indeed have my pity.
All I can recommend to you is two things.  Firstly go and see this film. And secondly ==pay attention==.  You'll be grateful that you did;  it's worth every moment that you give it.",10,0,0,30 January 2000
Schindler's List," The finest film ever made. Period.
","Quite simply the finest film ever made.  Nothing even comes close to this film.  It ascends to a new level;  it so poignantly and delicately conveys its message that you are left breathless, speechless and completely in awe of what you have just seen.Mr Spielberg so often shows his talent in a very forward and visible way; his restraint and control in this film adds so greatly to its power because it IS restrained and you are left with the memory of what the film is about, not just any specific effect, sequence, style or even performance.Indeed these performances were second to none, Ralph Fiennes comes particularly to mind  you feel such hatred towards him and yet there are flaws in the evil of his character, indeed this would have been a very hard part to play.There are also reminders of the human tragedy of the holocaust that tie the entire event to one person, the use of the red coat on the little girl is a simple and brilliant way of doing this; it serves to shatter any desensitisation that we may build up to protect ourselves from horrors that we are seeing, it brings the entire thing back home;  in such a simple and effective way and makes it personal  VERY personal.I think that this will serve to educate us and remind us of what happened for many centuries to come, it is a work that will stand the test of time like no other;  I firmly believe that it will go far in serving its ultimate cause, that such events may never happen again.In short I do not think that it is possible to speak too highly of Schindler's List.  I fear that we may never see another film of this calibre but if we do it would have to be something truly remarkable and be of someone of at least Mr Spielberg's brilliance;  a very, very hard act to follow.",10,9,13,9 February 2000
