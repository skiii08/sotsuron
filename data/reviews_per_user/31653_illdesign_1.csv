Kill Bill: Vol. 2," This movie is Tarantino's worst...
","Kill Bill vol.1 was a stylistic success, and QT tried to flip the script...but where this film fails is in it's dialog and pacing. Too long, too un-interesting and too Tarantino-ish. It's almost a sad caricature of QT.'s work up to this point. The final 'superhero' dialog between Beatrix and Bill was so unsuccessful and forced, I wonder if Tarantino was messing with his audience or committing career suicide... or maybe just feeling himself a little too much. In most other parts of the movie the actors fail to deliver on the dialog...and the pacing of the movie is so purposely slow that it renders the experience a snooze-fest. Tarantino tried to create a total contrast between Vol.s 1 + 2 but failed to make a watchable, entertaining piece.",4,0,1,17 September 2006
