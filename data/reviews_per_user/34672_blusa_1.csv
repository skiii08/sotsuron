Marie Antoinette," I loved it.
","It's very sad that people can't see what the film has to offer. It's sad that few seem to understand what the director means regarding the movie, what the music means, what everything means. Want to complain about the length of the movie, the lack of character, so on and so forth? ..Do you think it was very fun back then in Versailles? Want to complain about the actors speaking English? ..Would you've gone to see it it was in French?I loved it. I think it was simply beautiful. The clothes, the dialog, the little detail. I watch it with pleasure over and over again.",9,0,2,28 September 2007
