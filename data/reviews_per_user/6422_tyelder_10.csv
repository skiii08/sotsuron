It," see IT for yourself. just not by yourself
","Definitely the most anticipated horror thriller of the year and my personal most hyped film of the year. It was scary. It was funny. It is something that will give you nightmares. Go see IT!
 The two biggest highlights were the chemistry that was within the Loser's Club and Bill Skarsgard's performance as Pennywise. The kid actors, and actress, nailed their parts with such great skill that it seemed they were all friends in reality. 
 Their swearing and come-backs were some great comic relief and really showed how a group of kids act-of course how any kid would act if a flesh-eating shape-shifting clown was after them. 
 It is one of the greatest this year and one of the best in its genre since it has truly opened the doors for further possibilities in the horror/thriller industry. The jump-scares and the tension-building moments combine to make this movie one to remember for decades to come-just as the last one has for 27 years. 
 Stephen King even has stated he is very pleased by the film and it's portrayal of the characters from the novel. So if the King of Horror, himself, says this is one of the greatest, I think everyone should go out and see IT for themselves.

Avengers: Endgame," The End.
","Insane. Unbelievable. Phenomenal. They pulled it off. The biggest cinematic event in history. What a solid and well deserved conclusion to a 22 film universe.
Wow.
Really can't explain how somberly epic this movie was. Remarkable. The Russo Brothers have made an extraordinary masterpiece spanning two films that each individually standalone yet mesh together to create a fantastically awesome ending to a saga. A saga built by Stan Lee and carried on through many creative minds in the film industry who have tirelessly work to give the world something new. And boy did they achieve just that.
Wow.
The pacing made this three hour and fifty-six second blockbuster fly by faster than a snap-okay maybe not that fast. But what incredible editing; the cinematography juxtaposed looked amazing and flowed very smoothly. As daunting as the huge task to make this movie was, the filmmakers took it by the horns and owned it. Outstanding.
One to watch over and over again; enjoying newly found one-liners and moments that were not seen before. Discussions will arise, and that's what the best movies always conjure. However far fetched into the future of Marvel movies or the MCU that these audience discussions go, they all have to agree that this was truly a perfect endgame.
Heart-warming and grounded; explosive and sensational. This movie literally encompasses it all with an ending to the endgame that will, most definitely, both hold your breath and then take it away, as your jaw drops to the floor. The most iconic, astronomical, epic, glorious, marvelous, a-vengeful third act that will be nearly impossible to ever beat since it is the culmination of over a decade's worth of unparalleled hard work.
Avengers: Endgame deserves all the hype and all the soon-to-come broken box office records since it has surpassed all expectations and delivered something unique-which is just about all anyone can ask for from filmmakers. Officially declared as the best this year, so far, yet confidently declared as the biggest monumental event in cinematic history.
Loved it three thousand.
Wow.

A Quiet Place," Jaw-Dropping
","An outstanding feature-film debut for John Krasinski. Bold moves taken by director and star Krasinski make this unique horror/thriller the masterpiece that it is.
 From start to finish, this film had me on the edge of my seat, white-knuckled and anxious for what would happen next. This film's editing will have your heart pounding and it's brilliant sound editing/mixing will have you hearing your own heartbeat pound. Thum-thump, thum-thump. 
 This is a horror/thriller but it is focused solely on one family. Their chemistry and strong emotional connections are seen so beautifully on the big screen. Not many horror movies will also be tear-jerkers, yet A Quiet Place will have you emotionally in awe at the roll of the credits. 
 This film had me surprised and filled with joy knowing that Krasinski is just one of many more new generations of gifted filmmakers that will emerge to produce original great films such as this one.
 Definitely was one to remember for years both in its scares and in its silence. 10/10.

Jurassic World," Nostalgia.
","That's what made this blockbuster even more enjoyable along with the action and adventure (3/4 of the movie). Exciting twists and turns and suspenseful edge-of-your-seat moments are what make the flick one to not miss. Spielberg out did himself once again, never letting us down, as always. Bringing in familiar themes and the iconic John Williams master piece. My vote for the best remade film of the year and maybe even decade. High above the others or should I say chasing them.

Joker," Brilliance That'll Send Chills, and clowns
","One of the most anticipated films of the year, and one of the most unwanted, at first. Following Jack Nicholson, Jared Leto, and (the best) Health Ledger, was not easy but they got another renowned actor, Joaquin Phoenix, to play his take on the notorious villain. On top of the actor, the direction was up in the air and the choice of giving the reins over to Hangover director Todd Phillips was more worrisome. However, knowing Phoenix takes choosing his roles very seriously-only picking up the good ones-made having confidence in Phillips easier. Having a director suddenly switch genres and go in a totally different direction has been seen before and with Phillips, we get the surprise, and laugh, that we wanted.
Joker delivers exactly what you'd expect and want and then gives you more than you ever could have imagined. This film pushes the boundaries, it gives the gritty realism of the world's cruel moments their spotlight. It may receive backlash for it's brutally honest portrayals, it has already even before it was released. Though, it will definitely leave you thinking about it's many messages as you sit and watch the credits roll with Sinatra's perfectly themed song.
The controversies are created by the stirring up of the thoughts in the audiences' minds after witnessing Arthur Fleck's character development. This buzz does good in making this film more popular but more importantly gets the public to think more about the lessons to be learned about how to treat others. Sure, the main takeaways can easily be focused on the violence depicted and how striking it is, but it's the journey leading up to the acts that should be pondered on more. It's this very character arc that makes this movie so powerful and moving. It's brutal but it's real, that's what hits home the most.
Phoenix's performance is lived-up to and yes, Oscar-worthy. He clearly has taken preparation for the role seriously since he's lost over 50 pounds and nailed the sinister, contagious laugh, making his own twist on it by making it a condition of an uncontrollable laughter that Fleck has. You are glued to every scene he is in, waiting to see what unpredictable thing he'll do next, which is exactly who the Joker is at his core. Chaos.
There's also beautiful cinematography that complements with the subtle, yet terrifying, score. The clear and present Scorsese influence and nods-to are seen and invited, Robert freakin' De Niro is in this, come on people. Phillips also really brings us into this grimy urban 80's setting of Gotham perfectly. The cold harsh streets littered with trash and the poverty-stricken rundown housing.
Since there has been so much worrisome talk about this film, before it even was released to the world, you have to get the hint that it is not one to miss. However, when you do see it, go in as open-minded as possible or just go with premeditated ideas, the Joker is sure to rattle you anyways by the end of it. Either way, the messages and thought-provoking questions that this film instills into the audience is what truly sets this film apart. It's a masterful work of original filmmaking and we get to witness it, so please, sit back and just smile.

It Chapter Two," Overall, the best ending for this story.
","Something seen few from far between. A genuine finale that does not hint or poke fun at a possible continuation due to success at the box office. Andy Muschietti has delivered what he promised: an ending to a pop culture phenomenon that was beautifully crafted and brilliantly terrifying.
It Chapter Two was my most anticipated film this year and actually has been since September 7th, 2017 right after It ended on the note of revealing that it was only the first chapter and there would be more. And more is exactly what we get here with the final chapter. More scares, more character development, more scarring scenes, more comedy from Richie, and yes, definitely more Pennywise.
Bill SkarsgÃ¤rd takes your breath away quite literally with his chilling performance of the disturbing dancing clown. Every moment that he is on screen, he draws you into the movie even more than you already were. It's as if you are being lured in like all the other kids-his victims-were. Mind-blowing. SkarsgÃ¤rd gave it his all, and he was backed-up by the superb actors that played the grown-up losers. I mean, James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, and freakin Bill Hader as Richie Tozier-what do you expect? Not a sub-par performance out them, that's for sure.
The brilliant dark tone and amazing cinematography that brought the horrifying story to life in 2017 carries on directly into the final chapter which made the connection between the two films seamless. 27 years is a huge jump forward but that didn't phase Muschietti. He was determined and clearly ready to deliver a finale that was so worthy to be an adaptation of the timeless novel that the author, the king of horror himself, made a Stan Lee-style cameo in it.
If all the performances, cinematography, clowns, and cameos didn't impress enough, the countless scenes of truly impressive and terrifying large-scale stunts (most of which involve Pennywise and his fear-provoking tactics) will leave you awe-struck. And don't worry, there are so many of these moments in this absolute behemoth of a motion picture.
With a runtime of 2 hours and 49 minutes, you might be hesitant to go watch it and have to hold it during that last act after gulping down a large beverage. But, fear not, this is a cinematic event to witness in the theatre with hundreds of other movie-goers so you can laugh and scream together; just as it was meant to be:)
*cue 'We'll Meet Again' song parody by Pennywise*
We'll float again. Don't know where, don't know when. But I know we'll float again some bloody dayyyy...ðŸ¤¡
So, even though we won't be getting another movie after this sequel, we still can float again-over and over-by rewatching these thrillers that already have made themselves into classics.

Parasite," An Original Work of Art
","Yesterday, at around the beginning of the third act, I 'came to' and realized that this film had hooked my complete attention; then, at the roll of the credits, I had so many thoughts that were provoked by nearly every shot of this movie-laughing and awe-struck by what I'd just experienced. It had been a long time since a movie had given this effect, and it's original films like this that come out of nowhere every once-in-awhile. And today, I know for sure I have to write down my thoughts about this new surprise hidden gem, Parasite, because it truly deserves to be called a masterpiece.
This is my first, and most definitely not my last, foreign film to make this list of the greatest. I'm so thrilled that I was motivated to go see this as it has pushed my boundaries of what I thought makes a movie great.
Bong Joon Ho has delivered a flawless comical satire that focuses on real issues of the divisions of social classes that are present in every society-so it is not just relatable to Koreans. The genres that can be attached to the movie are numerous since it has bits of comedy, drama, suspense and even thriller aspects that all perfectly interweave together to hold your focus until the very end. It is both moving and thought-provoking, but is also a movie I'd recommend to anyone at any age or stage in their life. It is an all-around masterful original piece of cinema which makes for a very fun time at the movies.
Adding to the greatness of the film is the performances from the entire cast. A great ensemble of talented actors-including Ho's long time collaborator Kang-ho Song-make watching every character on screen a moment not to miss. When there is so much chemistry within an on-screen family, you know that the acting is superb to a point at which you forget you are watching a fictional story. You just sympathize with each character because you understand how their actions are driven.
Intertextuality is big in this film and makes a second viewing necessary and welcomed. I could watch this movie over and over and find many more hidden aspects that further prove how much thought and time went into crafting it. Bong Joon Ho has my pick for directing and this film for best foreign, possibly best overall.
Inspiring to both film enthusiasts and to the everyday human being-this one is very monumental to foreign cinema since it leaves you having a different perspective on the industry. It warns us not to overlook nor disregard a movie simply because we don't like reading subtitles.
