Alien 3," Good but not great!
","I love the Alien saga and its storyline. With that being said, the order of greatness is Aliens, Alien, Alien 3 and the much less 4th one. Many reviewers here on IMDb have lambasted Alien 3 for killing off some of the survivors from Aliens. They say that these characters were much loved and deserved more story. HERE is the thing: this movie was made like 6 years later. You can't have the same actors in a movie this late if one is a pre-adolescent kid growing up. So here we begin with a story where Ripley is the only survivor of Aliens and crash lands on a prison planet. Long story short, Weaver was excellent as usual, Charles Dutton and Charles Dance were both great. The other actors all tended to blend in together, however. Yes, David Fincher did walk out on this movie before it entered editing but he still directed it. The directors cut is a little bit longer and does more to flesh out the story. I especially liked the strange camera angles that were used while I disliked the thankfully limited use of CGI in the movie. Overall, the story was dark and dreary as was the tone. Not the greatest movie but it still holds up.",6,1,1,26 December 2011
Drive," Wow...A misleading title and uninspiring storyline
","Really disappointed in this movie. I enjoy Gosling's acting and loved the director, Refn's first movie, 'Bronson.' I figured this would be a smart mans Fast and the Furious. Well, at least Fast and the Furious had some type of character development and action to push the scenes along that made sense. None of the characters do much except stare at each other without talking or growl or complain. They do not progress in the story as well. Gosling's character goes from silent brooder to mass murderer. I thought he was just a driver!!! While I did embrace the style of the movie, modern day directors that are not established need to understand the importance of when and when not to use dialog. Just showing a characters face is not enough. Realism is communication. I don't know many people who can express all their emotions by the raise of an eyebrow. Oh, and the title says Drive but there are literally 2 scenes, yes only 2 scenes, of vehicles being shown driving. The first happens less that a minute into the film. I don't even think the car went over 30 mph. Lastly, the violence in this movie was borderline campy. Especially Gosling pulling his best rendition of Irreversible and American History X. If you are going to make a serious film, make death mean something to us and to the characters, rather than try to shock. I had high hopes for this film, yet a 4 out 10 it receives.",4,1,4,28 December 2011
