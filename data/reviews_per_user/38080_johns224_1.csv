Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's Star Wars, only less so
","Well, I first would like to start out by saying that the critics are being overly harsh on this film.  This is evidently simply by reading them, and them talking about all of the history of Star Wars.  If they were totally objective (ie, the reviewed it as one movie) then we'd have some different reviews.Anyway, this movie was good.  Not outstanding, not even great. I am a gigantic Star Wars fan, and it pains me to say it, but this film is #4 as far as I'm concerned.  Jar Jar Binks needs tobe killed. Also it drags in the middle.However, something I think EVERYONE seems to overlook is the fact that the end lightsaber fight is, bar none, the greatest action sequence ever put to film.  Ray Park is absolutely incredible and I was surprised how well Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson performed.  I could watch the movie 100 more times just to see the Jedi remove their cloaks and settle down to business. Don't let anyone tell you that any of the prior episodes (or future, I guess) have ANYTHING as well-put-together as that fight sequence.",7,0,0,30 May 1999
