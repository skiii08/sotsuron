The Longest Yard," Horrible
","Well, where to begin. Shawshank Repemption it ain't. I know that's a bit of a cruel comparison, but when you look at the Shawshank Redemption, and you look at this, you get really worried, and realise how bad this movie actually is.Is there a single likable character in this film? No. The main character deserved to go to jail, so did all the others. There is no one to sympathise with, no one to like, it just trails on and on, one loathsome character after another, with a laughable and uninteresting plot.Seriously bad. Just bad. Come on Adam Sandler, you're much better than this. And what was with the uncredited Courney Cox cameo? It was terrible!",1,2,4,4 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A Very Different Pirate
","This can be compared to The Empire Strikes back, it is a lot darker, sinister and scary than the first one, and where this worked with Star Wars, I believe it is Dead Man's Chest's downfall. This is more like Matrix Reloaded than Empire Strikes Back.Now I cannot stress enough that Dead Man's Chest is NOT a bad movie. It is just a very different film to the original, however, there are quite a few problems. The first being the characters. Far too many pointless characters returned from the original, and although it is nice to see them, there are no where near enough new characters for us to get to know. All of Jack's crew are those from the original, no new pirates, apart from the enemies.Davey Jones is no where near as good an enemy as Barbossa, there does not seem to be much point in him, not many explanations as to why he is the way he is, he just happens to be there, and wants Captain's Jack's soul. At least Barbossa had a purpose and a goal. There are also very few scenes between Sparrow and Jones, making the whole chase seem a lot less personal.There are also far too many jokes related to the original. No new material, such as a joke referring to Jack always being slapped by women, the dog with the keys and strapping sea turtles to their legs. Some new jokes would have been nice, although it is nice to be reminded of The Curse of the Black Pearl.Those are the bad points, but it is still a good film. There are some amazing sequences, such as an amazing watermill based sword-fight and a hilarious chase between Captain Jack and a group of cannibals. It is a good action film, but not quite the fun fest of the original.But...with an amazing ending scene, and plenty set up for the third movie, perhaps all these problems will be nearly ironed out by the end of the trilogy. Let's hope. A good film, but if this was the first film, it would not have been well received.",7,0,2,8 July 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," There should be Scrat: The Movie
","A very cute and lovable sequel, entertaining to both adults and children. Ice Age was a great piece of animation, with a great story, great characters and great cast. The sequel is almost as good.The only fault with Ice Age: The Meltdown, is that the plot seems dull in comparison to the original, with the original three characters and their herd fleeing the oncoming meltdown. However, it is made up with great new additions to the cast and is very very funny. In my theatre, I actually noticed more adults laughing than children.The star of the show is undoubtedly Scrat. He adds most of the humour to the movie, and I only hope that one day, there will be an entire movie based upon him. Hey, he might not say a word, but he's still hilarious.",9,0,1,20 April 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," 30 mins too long
","What a shame. This film could have been really great, and has everything in it to be really great, but sadly it is average. The film has everything in it to make it a great romantic comedy, hilarious scenes, great characters, a great choice of actors, and of course, the title.OK, so there's nothing wrong with being a virgin, but the jokes are funny and quite a lot of the humour is surprisingly original, however, it is let down by it's length. The film is just too long. After nearly two hours of listening to virgin jokes, and mindless squabbles between bit-part characters. A little editing would have gone a long way in making this a comedy classic. Well, classic is a bit generous, but something that will be remembered for the next 20 years or so. Sadly, it is too long and becomes tiring after a while.Also, what was up with the last scene? Completely out of place with the rest of the film. We could have done without that.",6,0,2,5 May 2006
Pearl Harbor," Someone hand me a sick bucket....
","Oh dear, what a waste of time and money and more importantly, three hours of my life. Titanic with bombs, only take away James Cameron and any sign of talent, story, pacing and throw in historical inaccurancies, clichés and a story that will make you want to throw up from all the cheesy moments.The film is really divided into three parts. The first part, the love story, the two best friends and of course the girl. Then one hour later, develop a love triangle, wow, Hollywood has never seen anything like that before! (sarcasm intended) Also add several less important characters and bit parts that you hope will die in the bombing sequence that you know is coming, unfortunately, only one of them does.Finally, the second hour, the bombing sequence begins. It's good to begin with, its good fun, the only part of the movie thats bearable. The special effects are great along with good fight sequences. Unfortunately, they even managed to spoil that with a ridiculous scene in which the two main characters fly around and save Pearl Harbor by shooting down two pilots.Now you think that with the bombing sequence over, the end of the film is near, you're just about to get your coat and run out of the movies, when all of a sudden, you're subjected to one of the most pointless hours I have ever seen in a movie, in which the survivors, and only the survivors for some reason, fly over to Japan to get revenge. Oh dear. At this point, the movie has completely lost the plot, the acting is horrendous, the editing and direction terrible, and I have lost interest in all the characters. The story has been completely suffocated with the ridiculous sub-plots.Avoid this film at all costs. Three hours of pointless clichés, cheesy scenes, unlikeable characters, historical inaccuracies and the worst direction I have ever seen. This film could have been so more, or less.",1,158,257,7 April 2005
Saw," Best thriller since Se7en
","I heard a few mixed things about Saw before I watched it, some people said it was really bad, some said it was really good, and others said it freaked them out, but one thing I noticed was that people couldn't stop talking about it, so I decided to be brave and watch it, and I was very surprised.Saw is a very superior thriller. It is no where near as gruesome as it is described. It is more psychological than anything, with the characters dealing with the predicament they are in, the history of Jigsaw, and the terrifying recollection of a survivor of one of his games.This film would have been perfect if it had not been for a few faults. For one thing, the movie is just far too short. Danny Glover's character could really have done with some more screen time, and it would have been nice to see a lot more Dina Meyer. Also, the plot seems to begin to resolve a little too quickly, how the characters know each other and how they are connected. This could have done with a little more development.No problems with the acting, and considering every scene was filmed as a rehearsal, just imagine what it would be like if it was given a little more production time.So, all in all, good stuff. Terrifying and gritty. Let's just hope they don't overkill it. I hope there will never be a Saw X: Jigsaws Revenge in the future.",8,0,2,26 April 2006
Fantastic Four," Fantastic Snoar
","This movie should be taken as a sign: to maybe rethink making every comic book franchise available into a movie. This movie really could have been something great, but it wasn't. It was very average, which makes the rest of us a lot less optimistic that these kinds of movies can continue.Everything in the movie feels like a cliché, the villain, the heroes, the situations they land in, and the ending, and that is very worrying, that after only a few years, it is all turning into a cliché.But its not all bad. Chris Evans works really well as Johnny Storm, adding humour that is not unintentional, and The Thing is equally as good, probably the most developed character in the movie, and a couple of the action scenes are exciting, but the rest of the movie feels rushed, almost as if the director/screenwriter has thought 'OK, comic book movies have these kind of moments, and this should happen' instead of taking a stab at turning Fantastic Four into something different and original.Wasted opportunity.",6,2,4,24 April 2006
