The Blair Witch Project," I'm not going to sleep until the sun comes up
","And I probably won't sleep at night for two weeks.  This is the most frightening horror movie I've ever watched.  It is almost devoid of the blood and gore that populates the genre, rather, it frightens with such a realistic style you actually start to believe these events did happen!  (The person I saw the film with had to be reassured the movie was fiction)  The pacing may lag in spots, but it only serves to heighten the suspense and tension.  I spent the last 20 minutes of the movie with my eyes covered, and the movie still horrified me so much I'll probably need a therapist.",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
