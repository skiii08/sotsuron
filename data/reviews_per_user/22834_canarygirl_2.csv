Ford v Ferrari," Magnificent - you don't even need to like cars!
","Watched this morning at 10 am. Wow. What a film. Matt Damon and Christian Bale are a great team on screen. Possibly the best movie I have seen Damon in. Bale, as usual, is sublime. The supporting cast are brilliant, especially young Noah Jupe, who surely has a great career ahead of him, rather like Mr Bale has and continues to have. You don't have to like cars, but if you like great movies with great performances this is for you. A shoe in for the Oscar nominations.",10,3,8,17 November 2019
Marriage Story," You will feel your heart hurt
","Since seeing the trailer at the cinema I have been looking forward to watching this. What an astonishing film. Your heart will break and you will cry your eyes out at the pain you witness Nicole and Charlie going through. The score by Randy Newman is masterfully played, touching, but not overbearing in any way. Adam Driver is a tour de force as a man whose life is falling apart and Scarlett Johansson is raw as a woman who wants to find her own voice. With superb supporting performances from the great Laura Dern and Ray Liotta as the lawyers they never originally wanted, this is a must see film. I hope it is richly rewarded come awards season.",9,4,5,6 December 2019
