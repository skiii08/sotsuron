Frost_Nixon," No one in America history will remain as enigmatic as Richard Nixon
","We want so badly to understand Richard Nixon, especially those of us who lived in his time. Did David Frost give us our best chance? Probably. In this Ron Howard film, Michael Sheen and Frank Langella give us possibly the only chance we ever had to understand the man. From Broadway to screen to living room to book, it seems we are guaranteed to never understand Richard Nixon. Even David Frost becomes entrapped in Nixon's elastic web, escaping at the last minute snapping back to himself again. And yet--and yet--as the screen fades to black we see Nixon against the ocean pondering....what? I wonder did he ever ponder for us? It is a wonderful film, Langella is superb, Sheen as well. Nixon's grandfather fought at Gettysburg, his beloved mother was a Quaker and yet his entire domestic policy gave lie to what had been sacrificed for his sake. Was he bad, was he so thoughtless, I think not--and that is the engima. See the film as you may never see something quite like it again.",8,2,4,1 January 2009
Milk," Penn brings his unique soul to a less than inspiring script
","Perhaps it is because I know the story of Milk and was involved in the women's movement at the time, but there is somehow a piece missing. I understand the growth of a movement. However as I watched the deterioration of Dan White, I learned no more than the magazine articles. Penn was wonderful but failed to pull me into Milk's circle. Josh Brolin was superb. With each appearance we see his hyper-disaster growing and growing and like a car wreck it's impossible to keep your eyes from his face. The significant question beats louder and louder as surely it must have for Moscone and Milk. Why? Perhaps I am too familiar with the times, the tools and the motion of a movement. It is aptly named Milk as it is his movie and his passion.",6,3,12,29 December 2008
