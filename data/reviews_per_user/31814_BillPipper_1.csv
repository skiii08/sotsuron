Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ay bendito! Really Bad
",This movie was made only for the money it was going to make... you can tell. It was long and really boring. Like with the pod scene it was so long and you knew he was going to win.  And that kid they picked to play young Vader was so bad.  Avoid this movie! Only true Star Wars fans will like it because they can't see that this is a horrible movie! Ay bendito! It was also long and boring.  SO bad that you will not want to see the next one.Rating 1/10 Effects were about a 6,1,31,59,25 March 2002
