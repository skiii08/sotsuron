Casablanca," Simply the BEST, but.....
","What else can one say, this is simply the BEST film ever. BUT, if you get the chance you should see another great movie that is almost as good. ALGIERS!! It is a classic too and hardly known. You will not be sorry.",Null,0,0,28 March 2001
Minority Report," A Dark Scary Look At The Future.
","I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, but I really enjoyed this movie. I found it very haunting and disturbing. Tom is a member of a 'pre-crime' unit. This unit exist because of three drug addict's children. They get these visions of future deaths. They can see who is going to be killed and their killer. The pre-crime unit's job is to view their visions and try to figure out where the crime is going to occur, so they can get there and arrest the (almost)killer. My question is: If they tell WHO the killer is and WHO the victim will be WHY can't they tell WHERE it will happen??? I know, it's a movie!!The special effects are the REAL stars in this film, as they are in a lot of Spielberg films. I did enjoy Mr Cruise performance though. I also enjoyed Max Von Sydow and Lois Smith as well. The screenplay is inventive and well thought out. We aren't left hanging wanting more answers. The future looks both amazing and scary. Amazing are those new COOL cars but did you notice the trains remain the same. Scary is they're going to have all those images everywhere hacking their wares on us! No privacy.7 out of 10",Null,0,0,25 July 2002
Memento," Brilliant Film!!
","This is a film which starts you from the beginning and sends you backward learning little by little about where you came from. Guy Pearce is the man named Lenny who can remember his wife being murdered but can't remember anything after that.He has short term memory loss and can't remember what happens from one moment to the next. Which is why he makes so many notes. He does have alot of police notes to help him find the killer and everytime he gets another clue or fact, he has to write it down immediately or he will forget it. No only does he write BUT just to make sure he doesn't lose his important notes, he gets them tatooed on all over his body. The story, with the way it is presented, is some what confusing, as it would be for Lenny. Who can he trust and are people who they seem they are? The idea of filming a story beginning with the end and ending with the beginning isn't new. It was done before on a TV show called 'thirtysomething'. The episode was about Gary and his wife, Susannah, having their baby. It started off just before the birth then went backwards to the starting of child birthing classes. It was a good idea but in Memento, it is put to great use and helps you understand the story and the character more. If you are thinking about seeing this, don't think, WATCH IT. One of the years best!!",Null,0,1,19 January 2002
Lost in Translation," They'll always have Toyko!
","I hate it when they call a film like this a 'Comedy' because that's misleading. Not to say there aren't funny moments. Bill Murray is always good at making awkward situations funny, but he is mostly playing it straight here. That's why so many people who are expecting a laugh out loud film will be very disappointed with 'Lost In Translation'.This is a film about two people who are not connecting with their spouses. They may have before but some how they have drifted away from each other. Now away in a foreign country these two meet and feel like they actually 'get each other'. Bill Murray plays a has been film star getting a chance to make a lot of money by making a Japanese whiskey commercial. His humor comes from the way he tries to understand and deal with the Japanese. Scarlett Johansson plays a former ivy league grad who doesn't know what to do with her life, other than being a wife to a entertainment photographer(Giovanni Ribisi). We see her move through Tokyo watching the Japanese live their daily life. She's amused by it all but it's still all alien to her. Bill is alone at his hotel and Scarlett's husband is off shooting pictures so she is alone as well. Both unable to sleep meet at the hotel bar and hit it off.
The thing I love about this film is that it does NOT follow the typical road that most stories like this would. There is no sex, just slight touches and glances. Even though he's old enough to be her father and she his daughter, they don't see each other like that. They connect on a different level, the mind, for which age means nothing. The movie ended not as I thought or hoped, but as it should have. They shared something meaningful and even though it wasn't long lasting, these moments shared will last them a lifetime. I am also VERY glad that the director/writer(Sofia Coppola) chose not to let us hear the final words of the film that were uttered by Murray into Johansson's ear. We just see her nodding, saying okay, and that final sweet kiss. This lets US imagine what he would have said to her before he went back to the states and his wife. I have always loved Bill Murray. Sofia Coppola wrote this film with him in mind and he does a brilliant job. This film made me fall in love with Scarlett Johansson. I liked her in 'Ghost World' but now I can't wait to see 'The Girl with One Pearl Earring'. I must also mention the cinematography is fantastic. The sites and sounds of Tokyo were both breathtaking and overwelming. I'm sure it was done that way to give you an idea of what the characters were feeling about what was around them. Thank you Sofia for a truly wonderful original film.PS: Anna Faris who plays the dumb blonde 'action' star is great. If you get the DVD, watch her extended interview session. She is funny!",10,3,6,23 February 2004
Mamma Mia!," Shear Fun and Enjoyment
","Hey the critics are NOT always right. I LOVE Abba and went to see this movie on opening night here. The cinema was packed full of people of all ages and of women AND men. As the movie progressed the audience really got into it and by the Dancing Queen number were clapping and singing along. At the end of the film when Ms. Streep asked the audience if they wanted another song they chanted, YES, GIVE US ANOTHER ONE! Everyone had so much fun that you felt so good when you came out. I mean, I LOVED Chicago but feeling was much different, and Hairspray can't compare either. You don't have to love Abba to love this musical. My 83 year old catholic mother-in-law who didn't even know the music before going in loved the movie. The best song moments for me were Mammia Mia, Slipping Through My Fingers, Winner Takes It All, and of course Dancing Queen. Everyone was good in the film but the best has to be Meryl Streep who keeps proving herself as someone who can do it all. Man, when she belted out Winner Takes It All I was stunned. She was good. She also showed she can let her hair down and have some fun. I mean, no one in this film is a great singer, but you forgave them by the way they presented the songs in the film. Only exception would be Pierce Brosman who's delivery of SOS was, er, not good but the women forgave him I'm sure. So if you want a feel good film where you will be singing when you come out of the cinema, AND you will actually know some of the tunes, go see MAMMIA MIA!",8,2,4,27 July 2008
Am√©lie," I LOVE THIS FILM!!!!!
","I can not say enough about this film. I LOVE IT!!! The acting, screenplay, direction, editing, cinematography, even the easy to read subtitles, are all excellent. I have found with my family and friends that either you are head over heels in love with this film, or you really hate it. I simply can not understand how anyone can hate it.This is the story of a sheltered lonely girl who grows up only to shelter herself away from others UNTIL she makes a discovery, and then everything changes. She starts to do good for others and in the end has something good happen to herself. It's sweet, fun, quirky and charming. It's filmed in a kind of muted colours. A look that was a product of the 90's(to which I am getting fed up with). The off the wall characters are reminiscent of STRICTLY BALLROOM or BIG EDEN. Audrey Tautou is a welcome face in films. She is as beautiful as Audrey Hepburn, at least to me. I have seen her before in HAPPENSTANCE and enjoyed her performance there, BUT HERE, she really shines. I am looking forward to seeing her in more films. Mathieu Kassovitz is a oddly cute actor who has done both French and American films. I hope he gets better roles like this from now on. This is a real gem of a film like PRELUDE TO A KISS or SHALL WE DANCE. I wished it had won something at the Oscars but oh well. I highly recommend this film and hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.",10,0,2,24 July 2002
The Breakfast Club," A Classic 80's Teen Melodrama
","I know, it could never happen. Let's just say that in a perfect world it could. That five students from different backgrounds and cliques could come together and become friends. Being real. Only in Hollywood people.
John Hughes makes his second teen film about kids coming together by way of a Saturday detention. They HAVE to be together. First they cut each other down as normal, then as time passes they begin to open up. Next thing you know they're all crying! I know to other viewers the subject matter that upset these kids doesn't seem so major, but THEY ARE KIDS! When you are younger, little things seem so important. With age we see how silly all this is. That's why I feel differently about this film now than when it first came out. When I watch it now, it's like relieving my high school days, but I won't say which character I was like most :]Most of the Brat Pack are here for this one. I enjoyed the soundtrack featuring Karla DeVito's 'We Are Not Alone' (played during the dancing scene) and Wang Chung's 'Fire In The Twilight' (played during the breakout scene). Enjoy a blast from the past and watch the unedited version and don't be a Neo Max Zoomdweebee.",Null,1,3,26 July 2002
Goodfellas," A true life mobster classic
","For those of you who say that this is nothing like 'The Godfather', you're right. 'The Godfather' is about the Mob life at the top (white collar). 'Goodfellas' is about Mob life at the working man's level (blue collar). Both show their home life and their working life, but are very different.In 'The Godfather' Corleone's gave the word, or in some cases, the nod to have someone whacked. In 'Goodfellas' these guys were the ones who carried out the order to whack someone. So you can not really compare the two. I like the idea of watching a Mob movie and not hearing that stereotypical Italian music playing in the background. The regular music of the day is what is more believable and enjoyable, at least to me.
We are lucky to get to see DeNiro is both of these films and what a performance he gives. No surprise. Liotta is 'charming' as the new kid on the mobster block. Though his character never kills, he does just about everything else. Pesci steals the show as the sick f**ker who can kill without any thought. Lorraine Bracco is stunning as Liotta's wife. It is interesting to see the two of them as they get swepted away in the muck of the underworld. She knows she should get away from this, but can't because it's kind of a turn on. (**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**) The two best scenes for me is when the camera is following Liotta and Bracco through a restaurant from the alley to their table without a cut. All done with such a grand flow. Perfectly shot with 'Then He Kissed Me' playing in the background. The other is when all those mob 'buddies' start showing up dead one by one, with that erie music playing in the background. Can't think of the song, but is was terrific and terrifying at the same time. (**END OF SPOILER**)Yes, 'The Godfather' was brilliant but DO NOT rule out 'Goodfellas'. View it as the other side of the coin in the Mob world. Perfectly acted, scripted and shot, and with a killer soundtrack to boot. Watch it or get whacked!!",Null,0,0,29 March 2001
