Black Swan," Not Just a Ballet Film
","Anyone thinking this is just a film about ballet is dead wrong. This is a pyschologically mind-bending film that really makes the audience feel the transition within Natalie Portman's character. Portman gave an incredible performance, really going above and beyond in the role of prima-dancer; actors(actresses) like these literally become their characters. Portman captured the screen and kept this writer entertained throughout. Mila Kunis's performance was well positioned in relation to Portman's; not overacting, but rather feeling natural on screen. This is a film for anyone who doesn't mind a little discomfort, and likes their mind bent",7,0,0,12 March 2011
The Da Vinci Code," Good Movie, great casting!
","The Da Vinci Code was everything I thought it was going to be. However, people are jumping to the conclusion that this movie wasn't very good. You have to give Ron Howard credit for making such a detailed story into a 2 hour movie. Sure, things were left our and thuings were put in, that's Hollywood. I thought the casting was great, though. Sir Ian McCellan was terrific as Leigh Teabing. Hanks,of course was wonderful, as usual. Jean Reno was the perfect Bezu Fache and the part of Sophie Neveau was also well done. I liked this movie, but it is getting a bad rap because people have their own individual ideas of what it shouldn've been like. It was such a popular book, everyone thought of the characters in different ways. Overall, this movie was worth seeing.",7,3,6,21 May 2006
