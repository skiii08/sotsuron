The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The story of Charlie and his adventures and misadventures.
","If you liked the movie, you will love the book. The book offers so much more that the movie just lacks. If you just go with the flow, you can relate with even the most senseless things that Charlie feels. The movie was really nice but kinda overrated. The only reason I liked the movie was because I had read and loved the book. You do need to have an open mind about certain things if you truly want to enjoy the movie. This is the story of Charlie and his adventures and misadventures. This movie is so much more than just the story of a 'wallflower' falling for a girl way-out-of-his-league and a shy boy learning to 'participate'. It is just so much more.",8,1,2,19 February 2013
