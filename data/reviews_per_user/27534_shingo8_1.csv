Hereditary," Dull & uninspired
","I was almost falling asleep in the theater, this was so boring. Little girl who clicks her tongue weird, head gets knocked off by a telephone pole, a bunch of slow scenes in dark spooky rooms... That's all I really remember from the movie, I found it dull and generic. By the time the cult scene in the backyard showed up I was just waiting to leave the theater. Everyone has their own taste I guess.",1,2,5,22 January 2020
