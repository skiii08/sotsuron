War Dogs," Good Saturday afternoon film.
","Based on a true story, 'War Dogs' makes a light comedy out of the shady goings-on of the international arms trade. From an acting perspective, Teller and Hill's on-screen chemistry tells the story of a close friendship that clearly goes back a long way and results in an immersive, emotional journey. Editing was, to be frank, better in the trailer than the film - at times, it felt slow; however on a whole 'War Dogs' was fun, punchy and action-packed. The soundtrack had been well thought about and the plot stays fairly true to the story on which the film was based. I'd definitely recommend watching 'War Dogs' with your mates as a fun, Saturday afternoon film but it certainly isn't iconic.",7,0,0,5 October 2016
