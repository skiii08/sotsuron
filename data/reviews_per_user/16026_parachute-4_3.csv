Scarface," A Pacino Classic
","An All-American gangster movie in the grand tradition. Al Pacino's Tony Montana might be a coke-snorting low-life and remorseless killer, but he's big on honor and family values so the audience can identify with the character to some extent even if we are shocked by his ruthless methods. The film contains some memorable highlights that made it a real winner at the time of its release and it still holds up pretty well despite the dated automobiles and bizarre clothes. The violence is extreme and makes even the most jaded audiences tend to set aside the popcorn and pay attention. Tony has a psychotic, and in due course, murderous jealously of his sister and we are not left in too much doubt as to the incestuous connotations. He suffers rejection by his mother, who regards him as being beyond redemption; surely the hardest of rods to bear for any villain in the traditional mold.We actually start to feel sorry for Tony and EVERYONE in the movie house cheers when he summarily dispatches the Columbian asshole who is about to blow up a target's car with the kiddies on board.My favorite scene is the famous 'bath' segment , where Tony sounds off at length about the ills of the world while soaking himself in the biggest bathtub in America, coked up to the eyeballs. The message comes through loud and clear: You can have all that money, power, and the woman of your dreams, but if mom won't talk to you, then you're going to be just one sorry pilgrim.Al Pacino dominates the film in a similar manner to the way Eli Wallach took control over proceedings in 'The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly' , but unlike the latter film,'Scarface' tends to suffer from not having a effective foil for the principle character. However, the supporting players all put in some serviceable performances. Michelle Pfiefer is quite effective as the bored trophy-wife and the other hoodlums are all pretty good. As in all the best gangster flicks, the cops have a minor role to play, and are basically just there to tag along and tidy up after the gangland carnage. Like in those old classics where Jimmy Cagney or Edward G Robinson did their stuff, we all know that that Tony has to get it before the end of the last reel. The finale doesn't disappoint, as he takes his leave us in the traditional style, screaming defiance at his multitude of enemies while blazing away at them with a 'Chicago Piano'. As with Cody Jarrett in 'White Heat', Tony Montana the loner, doomed by his life-style and lack of self-control, is retired undefeated and unrepentant. A good take on the standard 'down side of the American dream' theme, and I found the film more enjoyable than the more sophisticated, but convoluted and laborious 'Once Upon a Time in America' My main criticism of 'Scarface' is its tendency, probably unconscious, to push the vibe that 'crime may not pay, but its a good buzz while it lasts'. However, its certainly not the only film with that characteristic, and if gangster movies didn't glamorize the underworld to some extent, would we pay money to go and watch them ?R.

The Caine Mutiny," Bogart's masterpiece
","We all get to serve under a 'Captain Queeg' at some point in our lives, so all audiences can identify with the characters in this story. Hermann Wouk, the author of the book, was a US submariner in WW2 and its tempting to speculate as to whether Queeg with his steel marbles was based on a real person. I think the character is most likely a composite, but so many of the sequences, like the 'strawberry incident' ring true to anyone who has served in the armed forces or large bureaucracies.Humphrey Bogart, ably supported by a star cast, does an masterful job with an extremely demanding role. A lesser actor could easily have killed the part and turned the film into a comedy (compare with 'Mr. Roberts', which is INTENDED to be a semi-comedy) Bogart's Queeg isn't funny....real ship's captains never are.....but though we identify with the long-suffering crew throughout the 'action' part of the film; by the end of the trial, we are starting to get the picture from Queeg's point of view and the US Navy's point of view, and this was always Herman Wouk's intention in the book.I've always been a Fred MacMurray fan, and I rate his portrayal of the slimy Tom Keefer as top rate. Keefer is another character who we all run into sooner or later in life. I liked Tom Tully's De Vreiss ('War is hell, Willy') and check out the young Lee Marvin as Meatball. Whether Richard Widmark would have made an even better Queeg than Humphrey Bogart is problematic. I think he would have been too laconic and nasty. Bogart's Queeg is incompetent, neurotic and high-strung, but fundamentally not a BAD person, and this is true to Hermann Wouk's literary original. (Widmark didn't miss out. Some years later he was cast as an exceptionally nasty and fatally unbalanced ship's captain) In style, the film is a good, fast moving presentation let down a little (for modern audiences) by the 'toy ships in a bathtub' typhoon sequence. However, I'm sure that state-of-the-art 2006 special effects will appear rather quaint to audiences in 2056, and in any case, how would you go about filming a shipboard sequence in a REAL typhoon.This film is a true classic, and largely due to Bogart's definitive performance, it would be exceptionally difficult to produce a credible remake. They tried to sneak up on it a few years ago with one called 'The Trial of the Caine Mutiny', but that was a flat effort and is in no way comparable to the 50's original.R. B.",9,0,0,23 October 2006
The Godfather," A new beginning for the American gangster film
","The key to the success of this defining gangster movie is the faultless casting. All the characters are strong and eminently believable. The central masterpiece is, of course, Brando's Don Corleone, a feudal mafia warlord of the old school who can distribute largess or initiate mayhem with no more than a mumbled whisper to his ever-attentive mobster acolytes. Excellent performances from Al Pacino , James Caan, and Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden as the tough, bad cop and one of my favorite screen thugs, Al Lettieri as 'The Turk' Solozzo. A fairly predictable plot, even if you haven't first read the book , but so what? Its not meant to be a mystery. We the audience KNOW that the enemies of the family are going to get what's coming to them by way of the usual methods, and the director does not disappoint us. The traditional christening juxtaposed with the scenes of vengeful carnage are a masterful touch.Is it possible to be a good son of the Church and a mass murderer all at the same time ? The director poses this question to us and we are discomforted. We have to take on board the new reality that not ALL mobsters are flamboyant psychopaths in the erstwhile Hollywood tradition of James Cagney, Edward G Robinson etc; doomed to perish in a hail of police bullets or in the electric chair. The mafia boss could be the family man next door, the theme picked up and carried to new heights in 'The Sopranos'. At the end of 'The Godfather', we are left in no doubt that Michael Corleone and his henchmen are highly unlikely to be brought to book for their crimes, and more to the point, we the audience don't mind this one bit.In that respect, that is probably the secret to this films enduring popularity everywhere in the World that it has been screened. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone defends his family and protects their livelihood by doing the hard yards and making the tough decisions. We can all identify with that, but in balance, we are also presented with the down side of Michael's effectiveness as a mob boss. His brother-in-law is dispatched without mercy and he lies without remorse to his wife. These themes were effectively developed in 'The Godfather Pt 2', which is mostly concerned with the subsequent and inevitable degradation of Michael's humanity, culminating in fratricide. The violence depicted in 'The Godfather' was extreme at the time of its release and still has the power to shock. This is no bad thing as the mayhem is fully in context with the plot and is in no way glamorized. Real gangsters DO commit horrible crimes and often die in their turn bleeding in a gutter.R.
