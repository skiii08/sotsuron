Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Great conclusion
","To me, when a movie audience either hates or loves a movie, that's a good indication that the movie probably is a masterpiece.In Kill Bill you probably don't have a middle section, either you will love it or hate it.Back in the 70s, after the legendary Bruce Lee's death, there was a boom on Chinese kung-fu films, fast action, full of violence and Bruce Lee's wannabes, they were the main juice on oriental movie theaters.Kill Bill captures this time.. and then.... so much more. Its a '70's Chinese kung fu movie', a 'Kurosawa classic', a 'spaghetti western' re-visited, a 'Manga cartoon'... all that wrapped up in a fast-paced action movie, very well directed with superb soundtrack and magnificent fighting sequences.I must say that this is the best movie Quentin made since the classic 'Pulp Fiction'. Some people won't understand it, others won't stand it, but many will love it, cause its one of those movies made with such good taste and so many subtle details, that will soon become a classic.The cast was carefully selected, only 'Uma Thurman' could play 'Black Mamba' in such a way. She's fragile and deadly, innocent and ruthless at the same time. Uma always had that flexibility in all of her movies, and Kill Bill is no exception.Sonny Chiba as 'Hatori Hanzo' is perfect, the dialogue between him and Uma is one of the most memorial moments in movie history. He's the perfect samurai, a humble barman and yet the best blacksmith in Okinawa.Beautiful Lucy Liu delivers one of her best performances (the Japanese garden scene is one to be remembered forever, Darryl Hannah makes a unique and great comeback (and looks hot in nurse uniform), Michael Madsen usual is icy and subtle as a rattlesnake and 'Kung-Fu TV classic' series David Carradine is perfect as the cool, mature and deadly 'Bill'.To review Kill Bill part 1 and 2 separately is a mistake, both are only 1 movie and should be watched one after the other (same goes for Lord of the Rings trilogy, in my opinion).Just as Kubrik and Polanski, Tarantino is the master of one thing, ATMOSPHERE.... you really get sucked into his creations, forgetting real life for a moment and live a unique experience.Thumb's up to one of the best directors of our time.",10,0,1,25 October 2004
