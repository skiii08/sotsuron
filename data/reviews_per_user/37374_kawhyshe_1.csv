Miracle," 7.7/10?
","Bullshit movie! - I never seen the Russian hitting like that! No emotion, and the hockey scene was so bad!I know that is a American great event in the hockey history, but, the fact is, when you look the real aspect of this movie (technical aspects), this movie is so far of a masterpiece! The director show the Russian like traitors!Herb Brooks was a great coach, and the USA players show great courage and heart... but the fact is that this movie is horrible and exaggeration! Tank You! This comment are no political ends...It's true when you saw the title of the movie that this piece is a great miracle stayed 7.7/10!",Null,0,2,4 July 2004
