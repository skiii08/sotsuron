Hereditary," I'm kinda sorry I watched this
","People have been comparing this to Rosemary's Baby... but be warned that it's way more graphic than that, I might even say unnecessarily/gratuitously disgusting with the body horror. It lacks the artistry and subtle suspense of the aforementioned masterpiece. And it's a really slow (and I'm not kidding), slow burner. Could do with some editing. 
What stands out is Tony Colette's acting. The inevitability of her character's family's fate is heartbreaking and she depicts that perfectly.
The movie plays pretty well with our perceptionnof what's going on: is it a mental problem, is it family drama, is it witchcraft, is it a nightmare? Don't worry, the answer will be brutally shoved down your throat in the grand finale, just in case you didn't get it?
In the end, it has left me wondering: what even is the purpose of this movie? Probably to scare kids into going to church?",7,1,4,31 August 2018
