Requiem for a Dream," Absolutely Amazing
","This film is definitely not the feel good movie of the year, but it accomplishes what it sets out to do, and that is to show the affects of addiction beyond the level of a run of the mill junky. The film follows four main characters and the individual experiences they go through to fulfill their addiction.  Most interesting is the story about Sara Goldfarb, the mother of a junky who unknowingly gets addicted, herself.  This movie is very well shot and edited, and puts you in the junkies own world, which you quickly learn is not an especially fun place to be.  'Requiem For a Dream' may be rated NC-17, but it deserves to be seen by everyone.  This is a great film. Even Marlon Wayans who is mostly known for his comedic characters does a great job acting in a serious role along with Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, and Jennifer Connely.10/10",10,0,0,7 January 2001
Final Destination," Good Premise- Entertaining Film
","I heard mixed things about this movie before I viewed it.  While several people claimed to hate it, I heard more people give it positive reviews.  So I gave it a chance.This movie was very good for a genre which puts out so many bad ones.  At some points of the film, the dialogue could have been written better- but who cares?  This film wasn't written for its literary genius, it was written to entertain its audience, and to give them a few thrills.The opening scene on the airplane draws you in so fast, and it does not let you go until the end. And even at the end it doesn't quite let you go, because it leaves you thinking about it's interesting premise that deals with cheating death.  Yes, some of the death scenes were far fetched, but it's a movie.  Films are supposed to place you in another world. So I agree with the majority who gave Final Destination a good review.  It is a good, fun, creepy flick.  Oh- and Stiffler (American Pie) actually plays a dork in this one, yet he's still Stiffler.  Let the typecasting begin!",8,0,2,12 November 2000
Donnie Darko," This movie works
","I saw this movie when it was released on DVD, and I have to agree with most of the general reviews.  I loved this movie, bought it, and have watched it many times- attempting to put everything together.I try to get everyone I know to watch this movie, so they can understand how absolutely fantastic it truly is.  Most reviews have already covered what is so good about the film.  So, I will just say take a chance and see it.  And if you don't get it, see it again...  And if you don't like it, you are trying too hard.",10,0,1,18 October 2002
