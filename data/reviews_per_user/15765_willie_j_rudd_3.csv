The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of the best movies I have seen
","The first time I watched this film, I was fortunate enough to get a private viewing of it with a Q&A afterwards with Stephen Chbosky himself. Before this, I had not read the book or heard a lot about it. After watching it, I was hooked and read the book in a day. The movie is very faithful to the book, both of which are amazing. The casting is great and each actor represents what you imagine the characters being like perfectly. In fact, there are some scenes I personally think the movie did a better job of portraying than the book did. Chbosky said that the casting of the film was incredibly hard, but if you view this film, you can tell that it turned out for the best. I am not the type of person to take picking a favorite movie or book very lightly, so you can believe me when I say that the book is my favorite book and the movie is one of my favorite movies.",10,0,1,13 February 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino wows audiences once again
","Being a huge Tarantino fan, I was incredibly excited, and had been since I heard of the film, to see how Tarantino planned to entertain me. He far exceeded my expectations, as well as others I'm sure, with Inglourious Basterds. The film is told through a chapter format, as Tarantino did in Kill Bill, switching between Shosanna Dreyfus' plot to extract revenge on Col. Hans Landa as well as other high ranking German Officers and the plots of the infamous 'Bastards' led by Aldo 'The Apache' Raine who spread fear throughout the German Army through their brutality, as well as the much feared Donnie 'The Bear Jew' Donowitz. Brad Pitt as Raine makes the movie through his memorable lines he delivers as the films comic relief.I must warn, if you plan on seeing a film with non-stop violence, this is not it. There are scenes with immense violence, but a majority of the film is filled with dialogue, as are most Tarantino films. In all, the film may not be Pulp Fiction, but it deserves, and will receive, much praise.",10,2,10,21 August 2009
Pulp Fiction," Dialogue filled masterpiece
","Quentin Tarantino's second film contains a confusing storyline, lack of in-depth plot, no obvious message, and a seemingly never ending amount of dialogue.....and it works. Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece of contemporary film that has been applauded by critics and fans alike. The films non-linear storyline contains the stories of a couple who robs diners, two hit men who do a job for their crime boss, and a boxer past his prime who is asked to take a dive.The cast does a fantastic acting job that varies from Bruce Willis' street smart Butch to Uma Thurman's Mia who has a taste for nose candy. The two actors who shine in the movie is the duo of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Travolta's character goes through a variety of emotions throughout the film such as his laid-back side while riding in the car with Jackson, to the intensity in his face while saving Uma Thurman's character from an overdose. Jackson's character has a ferocity to him that makes the character very memorable.The camera work by Tarantino is wonderfully done with shots that include his trademark trunk shot and Mexican standoff. Also, there is a well put together soundtrack to the film. The masterful film making and acting in Pulp Fiction makes it my favorite film of all time.",10,2,5,15 February 2010
