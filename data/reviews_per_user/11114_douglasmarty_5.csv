Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Deeply offensive yet hilarious
","This is a hilarious movie and Sasha Baron Cohen is amazing. One of the reasons Borat works is because it doesn't belabor its jokes. It delivers the punch-lines then moves on. The movie is set up as a road trip, but each stop over has its own set of characters and comedic set pieces. The variation keeps things fresh and the relatively short running length (less than 90 minutes) ensures that Borat doesn't overstay its welcome.",Null,2,8,4 December 2018
Spider-Man 3," They should have stopped at no. 2
","Spider-Man 3 is really two movies crammed into one, the first of which is a lot better than the second. Spider-Man 3 starts out strong but before it finishes, many viewers will desperately wish it had called it quits an hour earlier. Compared to the other two movies in the series, this one is a misfire. It's for completists only, and even they are likely to feel let down. Spider-Man and the first sequel were breezy adventures - easy and fun to sit through. Spider-Man 3 is a chore. The effective moments require a lot patience to uncover and some of what has to be shifted to get to them is not worth the effort. People love trilogies because it's said that good things come in threes, but this series would have looked better and felt more satisfying had the filmmakers stopped at two.",Null,1,2,29 December 2018
Saving Private Ryan," One helluva movie
","One of Spielberg's finest, and finally an academy award for his perseverance but Saving Private Ryan is a tour de force starring a good mix of new and the seasoned and some awe- inspiring visuals. Seriously the opening beach attack literally transports you to the war such is its magnitude. This is a film that should be watched in history schools, film schools and humanity schools. When Spielberg finally hangs his boots Saving Private Ryan will be recalled as one of the finest gems in a great career.",Null,1,1,20 July 2018
Meet Joe Black," Rather dull feature film considering the amount of talent involved
","Meet Joe Black is ultimately a disappointment and an an exercise in how one should understand the pacing of the movie. Starring Brad Pitt, Claire Forlani and Anthony Hopkins this is based on an older film called Death takes a Holiday (1934). Brad Pitt dies and is reborn as 'death' and enters a wealthy mogul's life to understand the meaning of life, meanwhile falling in love with his daughter. The pacing is a killer and sorry to say but the acting is pedestrian- especially Brad Pitt. It seems they're all here to collect paychecks to buy mansion, the likes shown in this film.",Null,1,3,16 August 2018
Flight," Watch it for Denzel's towering performance
","Flight is a great example of everything coming together- screenplay, characters, acting and special effects. This movie is about addiction and the main character who happens to be a pilot and a raging alcoholic. So bad is the situation that his wife has left him and his sons do not have an iota of respect for him. Also, he drinks on the plane- a plane he is piloting! The crash sequence is quite jarring and anyone knowing the work of Robert Zemeckis would know he is a master in creating realistic looking CGI sequences. This is a great scene but what follows is equally fascinating. The pilot is brought to the court in charge of manslaughter(he manages to save most but not everybody on board). Washington is great as the central character. Go watch flight to see a nuanced character study of a flawed individual.",Null,2,3,18 September 2018
