Source Code," Intense, intelligent and imaginative.
","I started watching this film without knowing anything about it except that it was in the sci-fi genre. I'm glad of that because having seen it I feel that's the best way to approach this film, although I know from experience that most people like to know a little more than just the genre.This is the first time I've rated any film a 10, so that speaks for itself.All I can say is, if you're looking for NEW ideas and like intelligent sci-fi, then take a look at Source Code.Cheers and happy viewing.",10,1,1,13 November 2016
