The Incredible Hulk," What a decline
",I did not really like Ang Lee's Hulk. It was so much less than the Marvel Hulk. Too much psychology and too little anger.Well. After 'The Incredible Hulk' I have to change my mind. Ang Lee understood at least Hulk is about anger. About rage. About loosing your mind in rage. Only love could break that.What the hell is 'the incredible Hulk' about? He isn't even really angry. This Hulk is behaving like a big gorilla. Rather status than anger.This incredible Hulk is just heading straight forward into the realm of the horrible TV series. I am absolutely not looking forward to a new incarnation of Bill Bixby's Hulk. Yuk! The venture is now heading into that direction. What a disappointment.,3,4,8,12 April 2009
Memento," Almost brilliant
","Except for the final couples of minutes this movie is really cool! The general idea of running the plot backwards seems totally silly at first glance. But this truly surprising film makes it. There is even an increasing tension while the movie moves towards it's plot point.This kind of storytelling is simply ingenious! But it only works once! You've seen one movie 'reversing', and there's really no need for another one.There are even some great emotional moments, that should catapult 'Memento' into the region of 10 or 9 stars.But they mess it up within seconds at the end. When our deranged hero tells us something about life in general and memory in special the movie breaks down. The philosophy behind these few sentences (from the off) is crude. Not at all matching the quality of the film.That costs it one star!Movie makers in general should be very careful about philosophical ideas in their movies. Especially when these ideas are expressed by their characters. They rarely reach an agreeable depth of thought!",8,2,5,30 May 2007
World War Z," Waste of budget
","I didn't read the book, that said first. So I will not complain about the story differing significantly from the original.I was only looking forward to see a real big budget zombie movie. Zombies on a global scale, big pictures, big war. A very mild zombie picture though, with PG-13. And I was hoping to get a sort of realistic approach to the matter: Infection spreading, society crumbling, fighting back, and themes like that.WWZ starts in the middle of it. The big cities all over the world are in the state of getting overrun. The whole movie focuses on one man trying to find out where the 'infection' came from. And he wants to get back to his family. The only other significant character is a female Israeli soldier who manages to escapes together with him from dying Israel.Even with this pretty narrow viewpoint WWZ might have become a nice movie.But the zombies are way to fast. If you are confronted with 2 or 3 of them there is virtually no escape. These monsters are even faster then they were in '28 days later'. Once bitten a victim turns into a zombie within seconds. How should a disease that infectious spread around the world? Every single infected person/zombie would be detected long before reaching any overseas destination. Just take a look at '28 days later', exactly for this reason the infection is confined to Great Britain.Well, I probably should not complain that much about the logic in a zombie picture. PG-13 and super fast zombies however destroy all horror. The zombies are most of the time just a fast flowing mass. And these flows are animated pretty poor. What did they spend the budget on? In the last third of the movie things get more claustrophobic. When our hero tries to get some biological samples in a lab complex full of zombies. There are numerous examples for this in other films and mostly done better.WWZ has some really mass scenes, but the poor animation spoils them. They just do not shock you because they look too phony. And because there is not one person that you really care about. It is by far not bloody enough for the genre. The characters are somewhat remote. One simply does not care that much when someone gets slaughtered. (A lot different from 28 days)The finale is pretty disappointing. The movie ends exactly where the war would/should start.The film is entertaining, but no real zombie horror movie. Rather watch the Romero films or the walking dead. Even resident evil is more interesting.",6,5,9,4 July 2013
Life of Pi," A nice movie
","It is a nice movie, really nice. But just nice, nothing more.The film has a light, but thoughtful tone. The fantasy-story is told in an immaculate way. Picture, colors, characters, all fit in just perfect.But the overall result is just that bit too slick to make you care.Emotionally the main character is more or less remote. Yes, he shows some grieve about loosing his family. And he is in despair, at times. But only to an easily bearable extend. If the audience would be confronted with the full force of his emotions, the story would not be nice or lovely after all.The same happens intellectually. A portion of the film deals with man, god, believe. And yes, the main character has a lot of reason to doubt god. But again, this doubt is not going too far. It just scratches the issue, so everything remains easy. Nothing too serious here. So it has hardly any meaning.Life of Pi is nice to watch, but do not expect something with real substance.By the way: This movie will work in 2D as well. I felt most of the time 3D was not really adding anything to the film.",6,1,4,15 January 2013
Pacific Rim," American Anime
","Pacific Rim is nothing else but an American version of Neon Genesis Evangelion. The setting, the cities, even the wording (Kaiju, JÃ¤ger) point in that direction. Monster-Techno-Anime as a real movie, in 3D. Fantastic. However... The movie turns out to be an empty shell. The visuals are great, the general storyline is just fine. Japanese anime have this fantastic settings too, but they have the tendency to concentrate on the psychology and philosophy of the characters (see Neon Genesis Evangelion, Blue Submarine No 9, Akira, Ghost in the shell for example) This adds enormous depth too the films. Yes, I know, it sounds strange. But the Japanese demonstrate and proof that even a monster movie needs some depth. This is missing in Pacific Rim. Only in the scenes with young Mako you get a sense of this. And these are actually the only moments where one gets any idea about the motivation of the characters. So, in the end, I watched this beautiful looking movie, and constantly missed something more than just plain heroism. And hardly ever there was more. Nice movie for fans, but not a good one.",6,1,3,1 February 2014
Man of Steel," Nothing special
","I like most Zack Snyder's movies. He has a very strong visual style. The stories do not always match up. But granted for that.There is however nothing special about 'Man of Steel'. It was obviously too expensive for any experiment, for anything different but mainstream.The opening on Krypton shows off its production value. Yet neither pictures nor story leave a profound impression. The following act is the most interesting part of the movie, when Superman roams through the world. Hiding, without a goal or a reason. That does not last all too long.Lois Lane enters the story, a not so pretty and not so interesting character. Fortunately the battle starts pretty soon. So you sit in the cinema and think to yourself: 'Action, finally...' But it does not differ from 'Transformers', from 'Avengers' (which had some humor, making it cool), 'G.I.Joe', 'Godzilla', and all the like. But this smashing and crushing is way too long. It is as if someone had turned the volume to max and just left it that way.'Man of Steel' is better than 'Superman returns' but definitely not a very good film. It is just about average.",5,3,8,4 July 2013
Resident Evil," Almost perfect
","This is an almost perfect horror movie. It starts with cast, that works great. Even though killed pretty soon, at least most of the cast, each person gives a convincing performance. And that is exactly the 'overall-feel' about the movie. The pieces - actors, storyline, filming - fit together. It IS a stupid monster movie, it is NOT like the game, but everybody takes the project serious. But it is in no way a great piece of art. Resident Evil is a solid movie, and good at this, no more! Nothing new, except for the scene with the zombie dogs. Ain't that beautiful. It is a new idea for the genre, it's visual fun. Simply cool.",7,3,4,25 February 2007
No Country for Old Men," Almost better than blood simple
","'No country for old men' reminded me much of 'Blood simple'. The same kind of inevitable violence and brutality. All blood and gore driven by the personalities.With 'No country...' you get the same feeling! The philosophical approach of the killer adds something new, something pretty interesting. He let's a guy at a gasoline station toss a coin. Everyone knows, if the clerk loses, he's going to die. The clerk is a lucky man. And then, this quote as the clerk is about to put the coin into his purse: 'Don't put it there, you couldn't tell, it's a special coin...' Whaow, how beautiful! The killer's story keeps with this momentum. That would have ended up with 10 out of 10 points. So where did the Coens loose 3 points? Tommy Lee Jones plays a character of an old sheriff. Actually this guy starts to die, while the story unfolds. That means, we're watching a movie about a psychopathic killer, and suddenly a main character of the story starts telling us something about dying of old age.I have only seen one movie that could handle something like that: 'Il Gattopardo' In this classic death, decay and dying is introduced silently, naturally and convincing. One can feel Lancaster (Gattopardo) dying.I felt that 'No country for old men' tried to reach the same effect. But, sorry to say, the Coen's aren't as good as Visconti in this aspect. They fail! So we are left with a pretty good killer story, however not reaching the quality of 'Blood simple' (more straight forward) or 'Il Gattopardo' (more deep and convincing) Still, it is a very good film!",7,1,4,9 June 2008
District 9," Different approach
","Dstrict 9 is quite a political movie. Too much politics for a truly great movie and still not enough of it.D9 starts almost completely political correct. Poor refugees (albeit aliens) are somewhat stranded in Johannesburg. Unemployed and foreign they cause the usual social difficulties, especially growing racism. An ignorant government and a multinational and of course evil company threaten the poor existence of the aliens. So far so boring and predictable.Fortunately the plot takes a turn. The rather stupid company executive, who is in charge for the relocation of the aliens, gets infected and slowly turns into an alien himself. Due to great acting and fine storytelling this kept me very interested and entertained.In the end this executive defends an alien from the military. The alien escapes (with his son) and promises to return to save his kind. The executive survives and finishes his metamorphosis.This all is filmed very well, with a fine balance of intellectual input and sufficient blood and gore.But D9 is a political movie and has to be measured by its intentions and messages. Clearly it is a movie against racism. Fine. However it is extremely racist itself. South Africa has a multi-tier society. White people, black people from South Africa and black people from abroad. Who do you think is living in the worst slums? Right, people from Kenia, Nigeria, simply from the rest of Africa! And what kind of people are the most violent and superstitious ones in the movie? Nigerians! No racism here?! To me this ruins much of the credibility of the film.And in order not to get too serious the movie has a neat little happy ending. Our hero (the mutating executive) meets an alien. The alien's son is some kind of technological whiz-kid, repairing all alien devices. Swell. So the movie lets father and son escape. Naturally they act not only to save themselves, but mainly to free their people. Seen a thousand times, you know. And nobody would take any precautions to blast the mother ship into oblivion in case anything like this might happen? D9 is a nice entertaining movie, taking a different approach to tell all of us how bad racism is. But it's political correctness is predictable and the results are sugar-sweet. And it is inherently racist in itself. That makes it worth roughly 7 points.",7,0,8,8 July 2010
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Superb technique
","I watched the movie in HFR 3D. And that was pretty awesome. The picture quality is outstanding. Full of details, no picture noise. The 3D effect was without flaws. The only drawback is a video look (aka soap effect) in fast moving scenes. That looks pretty strange, but the overall quality is well worth it.The movie itself is a typical Jackson film. Every single piece of the story is explicitly depicted and displayed in detail. Except for the battle scenes there is hardly any change in speed of narration. One would expect unimportant parts shortened and relevant parts highlighted. Yet that is not a virtue of the director. So the film has its lengths, well a lot of lengths to my mind. 2 hrs. would have been well enough.The battle scenes are huge, and hectic. A little less would have been more appropriate, for my taste.So I think it is an OK-movie, and a technical milestone.",6,1,6,30 December 2012
Drive," 30 years too late
","The movie is simply 30 years too late.If it had been made in the 80ies, well, then it would have been some sort of innovative and interesting.But you see, Michael Mann (and the likes) made films like this already.There is not a minute of new idea, new filmmaking in this movie. Refn obviously just tried to produce a long 1980 music video. Unfortunately the film itself is so much less creative than the better videos of that era. All characters stay shallow. That would not be a big issue if the pictures would be suggestive enough to let you forget that. And this is the problem of the film.Either you actually produce a music video. A flow of a pictures and music (electronic music considering the decade), dialog minimized to the bare necessities. Or you try play it cool like an Leone western.Every minute of watching this film one can sense this conflict. And the movie never decides which way to go.Better watch the originals from the 80ies.",3,2,5,10 August 2014
2012," Not funny enough
","Well, this movie starts like big fun.The filmmakers and the audience know, there is some kind of story and explanation at the beginning, but we're sure going to blow up earth. So just sit through this inevitable 15 or 20 minutes and the big fun of crushing everything will start.During the first 40 or 60 minutes this movie follows this general idea. It is really great fun. Yeah, no sense at all, but a lot of beautiful destruction. Most of the time done pretty convincing.But hey, it IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to take this plot serious. There is no need to take anything serious. However, you get the full load of pseudo deep family story. Divorced dad and son saving, well, a lot of people. A strong appeal to acting very moralic. The notion included that politicians are free of any moral.And that makes the movie fail ultimately.It starts as a tongue in cheek show with only one goal: Destroy almost anything in the most spectacular manner. And that would have done fine. Yet there has to be some heroism, some moral and some good an bad. And that is just a complete failure.This inherent story problems are a lot worse than logic goofs and failed special effects. They really spoil the fun in an otherwise mindless disaster movie.",5,0,1,24 June 2010
I Am Legend," New perspective on the last human
","I was quite convinced, 'I Am Legend' would be a pretty bad movie, before I went to see it.I knew 'The Omega Man' and I really liked it. So I thought, why does Hollywood produce just another remake of a beautiful film? And I think, there are definitely too many remakes and far too many part two's. And most remakes do not match the originals, for e.g. 'The Time Machine'.But 'I am Legend' IS different. It focuses on the main characters emotions. And these emotions are rather credible. Will Smith's play is just outstanding. He makes the audience like Neville, and suffer with him.OK, they use all storyboard-tricks to achieve this effect. To have a dog as second main character, a dog as only and true friend of Neville, well, that captures the viewer's heart. If such is done well, it is fine, and it is done well in this film.The fight against the virus victims, the 'vampires', is not the main theme. These monsters are adding the fear and despair to the story. But this Neville is not running through the city (as did the Omega Man), shooting creatures wherever he meets them. No, this Neville is afraid. He captures them, but he fears them.Up to the end 'I Am Legend' is great entertainment. It has strong emotional moments, even some very quite moments. And all this is convincing.Does it have flaws? Oh yes. The cgi is not very good. And the 'vampires' are a disaster! If the vampires had been actors, humans, it would have been just fine. But no, nowadays one has to use computers. But if you use cgi, you got to be good at it. The creatures in 'I Am Legend' suck! Costs it a star. And the movie ignores the confrontation between Neville and the 'leader' of the vampires. It is there, but the personal dimension of this fight is just depicted rudimentary. Overall, very entertaining.",7,1,3,19 January 2008
Transformers," Surprise! It's an OK-movie
","When I went to see Transformers I was expecting the worst.Another film based on a cartoon series! And it was for the kids, so the Transformers have been all good, and the evil Decepticons were simply evil. And Michael Bay as a director, most of his movies are pretty bad to my mind (Armageddon, Pear Harbor, Bad Boys, The Island). Perfect ingredients for another cinema-disaster.But I liked the Transformer-cartoons, so I had to watch.What a surprise. The main theme is not really about the robots, but about a teenager and his (of course) problems with first love. This theme is told with a lot of humor and irony, making it bearable and in fact entertaining.The robots add to the fun and deliver the action, otherwise no one would watch the film. Very good effects and a nicely dry tone of storytelling make this good fun too.So it is not a great movie. But it is entertaining and worth the money. If, and only if you like brainless teenage-sci fi-a lot of things getting blown up-movies.",6,0,4,31 December 2007
Children of Men," Impressive, yet too strained
","This movie has some extremely emotionally impressive moments. In these minutes it is simply fantastic.But it spans a much too large range of storytelling.In the beginning it is simply the usual anti-utopian story. It has strong hippie-elements (Sir Michael Caine as Grass-farmer) I Thought to myself the film ought to have been produced in the 70ies. So the movie is in its first act light at heart, a strange hippie-dystopian future.The emotional tone changes with the appearance of the main character's ex-wife (or girlfriend, Moore). Theo Faron (the hero, Owen) gets involved with terrorists and the first female to be pregnant in 18 years.Story-background: Britan is the last 'civilized' country (quote: Britain soldiers on) in a world, where no babies are born. Refugees (quote: Fugees) are a problem. Illegal immigrants are hunted and sent to concentration camps. The resistance (fish) finds/controls a pregnant (!) fugee-girl.Well, the hero's ex gets killed. Kee, the pregnant girl, from now on trusts Theo (Hero). He discovers a conspiracy within the resistance and escapes with Kee.In order to get in contact with the (almost) mythical 'Human project', they have to get into a fugee camp. Hippie-grandpa's connections make this possible.From now on we are in a desperate world (full of political implications) The entry-area of the camp is obviously a blend of Guantanamo and Iraq-prisons. The camp itself is Warsaw ghetto (but a mild version) Resistance and state-troops storm the ghetto, while islamistic demonstrations take place.Kee gives birth to a baby girl. Kee, baby and hero get between the lines (resistance vs. state troops). By showing the baby they escape in a fascinating scene. Everyone is deeply impressed by the child, fighting ceases (for a while).They leave the ghetto in a rowboat, in order to meet the 'Human Project'. Theo dies (being shot by the resistance). The movie does not end pessimistic, 'tomorrow' appears instead.Hippie romantics, Guantanamo, Warsaw ghetto, Iraq, middle east and the end of the world. There are even some cave-paintings visible when Kee and Theo get into their rowboat. This is simply too much.Warsaw ghetto was hell on earth! People (grown-ups and children) were starving! When they resisted, German army destroyed the whole city. The survivors were send to concentration camps, which were the only places worse. No movie can reproduce this horror. So can't children of men.I think it is a brilliant movie, but it tries to tell us a story, that would require three films.",8,2,10,23 June 2007
The Dark Knight," Not that good
","I do not understand what movie everybody seems to have been watching. 'The dark knight' simply is not that good.I am sorry. Heath Ledger is dead. Should we just close our eyes and pretend everything he did in this film was great? I definitely do not think so. He was just re-acting Mr. Depp's pirate! While Depp was absolutely convincing in his role as Cpt. Sparrow, Ledger only copied the whole concept. That was pretty weak acting.I still do not understand why Gary Oldman plays Gordon. What a complete waste! He could be such a fantastic villain, or brilliant at every role, that has light and darkness about it. Gordon is just a straight honorable man. And you let Oldman play this!? The rest of the cast is doing pretty fine. Even though I think some of the great names are straight forward wasted on stereotype roles! So what about the story line? Does it overcome any of the above mentioned items? No way! Batman is forced to consider his actions. Is it in any way justifiable what he does? Off course not! Taking the law into your own hand is no good idea. There is historic evidence: It is very advisable to place the force into the hands of a state, that is bound to law and that is democratic justified. While it is a romantic idea to overcome the weaknesses of the state by individual actions it is in practice the end of a free society.On a comic book level batman is cool. But is there any sense in seriously considering his role? No, that's ridiculous. Our hero does not kill villains, he does not judge them. But he is bending the rules to catch them. So he is bending the rules by spying out all cell phones. Is that in fact worse than beating up presumed criminals? Worse than breaking every single piece of law in order to catch th 'evil' ones? It is absolutely silly to have this as a theme in a batman comic-movie. Every reasonable state would HAVE to put our hero into prison. No option on that, period.The movie is pretty good, 5 out of 10 ain't to bad. But that's all!",4,4,8,19 July 2009
Avatar," Strictly visual
","400 Million and no whatsoever bearable story.I understand, a project of that size may not be a failure. An interesting story is always controversial and disturbing. And thus risky. And that is exactly how the story is. Predictable to the very last second, good and bad neatly sorted out.Unfortunately the filmmakers added a moralic momentum. Every fairy tale, every archetypal story is simply about good and bad struggling with each other. Just have a look at good old Star Wars.Avatar is a lot worse, good is obviously American indians, but pretty ecological, and in deep love with gaia. While white American men, members of the military industrial complex, are out there to destroy everything. I am simply too old and by far not dumb enough to buy that crap.The pictures are brilliant. Especially the 100% computer generated ones. While live action has some difficulties in 3D, CGI is just plain perfect. Even though Pixar is a serious rival in technological excellence, pixar does not have the money to produce almost 3 hrs of highly detailed landscape. But that is money only! The extremely convincing animation of the alien characters is the most impressive feature in Avatar. In fact, it is the only real new feature. You could have seen everything else in other movies, not that exhaustive though.Avatar is impressive, a must see. But ultimately it is a mindless piece of film. I would have enjoyed it a lot more without this childish story.",6,0,3,10 January 2010
Inside Man," Improbable story, implausible characters
","One would not expect a standard thriller or average crime movie with Spike Lee as a director. And yes, 'Inside man' is on the first glance a lot more creative than the average bank-robber film.But what makes a movie about robbing a bank and taking hostages interesting after all? It could be <ul><li>documentary </li></ul><ul><li>psychological </li></ul><ul><li>action oriented </li></ul><ul><li>concentrated on an interesting criminal plan </li></ul>'Dog day afternoon' for example was mainly psychological and brilliant at that. 'Quick Change' is an example for interesting plots.'Inside man' tries to balance between these poles and adds some politics into the storyline. However there is no in depth psychological insight in the main criminal character. Likewise there is no real explanation of the main character's motives and intentions. So the movie is (for a while) lingering in a psychological confrontation of these characters. As there is no inner development this confrontation remains simply uninteresting.Fortunately the storyline does not insist on this element but rather explores the intricate plan behind the crime. The criminals and the hostages are dressed the same way and thus are indiscernible. So police has to sort out who is victim and who is gangster afterwards. That could have been highly entertaining. But that's the point where the side plot takes over. The owner of the bank has some dark Nazi secrets and some diamonds stored in a safe deposit box. Guess what everyone's after? Guess what the whole plot's about?How disappointing!",5,2,5,27 May 2007
The Mission," Political fail
","In an all too simple storyline this film tries to blur the responsibility of religion in the slaughter of people.This movie tries to tell you, that there is in fact a good (Jesuits) and bad church (rest of the catholic church). And if everyone would follow the good part, well, heaven on earth.Even though not as brutal as the rest of the catholic church, the Jesuits were in some way pathfinders for the west. And they did not have, and do not have, any respect for foreign cultures and believes. In their blind religious faith they think (until today) that a non-Christian soul is lost forever. In fact losing its eternal afterlife.And that justifies almost anything to convert heathens into Christians. They were and are in strict accordance with Rome.A large church of course has a lot of factions, true believers and straight forward earthly politicians. So the roman catholic church never has been a pure spiritual organization and often enough sacrificed believe over power.So in this example of its history. Big surprise, isn't it? And sure, the natives are living in a paradise and are true angels. The usual romantic stuff. So the audience feels a lot of sympathy for the natives. Classic Hollywood.This combined with rather uninspired movie-making results in a shallow piece of irrelevance. The simplicity might make it appeal to the masses. But the film fails with all major historic issues.Do not watch it, if you are politically interested.",2,4,15,1 May 2014
Lord of War," Political satire, and still a very good movie
","The best thing about Lord of war: It doesn't take itself too serious.It is very political and deep inside pretty moralistic, but it always has a more or less cynical point of view. And that is to my mind the only way to do a film about a theme like arms trade.The alternative would be to take things serious. And show the audience the consequences. But one cannot do that! One cannot display the horrors of real life, of real war, of real genocide. That would be worse than any splatter movie. A documentary could do it. But not a feature film.Being a cynical satire the characters in 'Lord of War' lack some depth. The main character Orlov for example does not really develop into an arms dealer, he just decides to be one. Or take the sub-plot of his wife. This could have been a deep psychological study. Fortunately 'Lord of War' does not really care for psychology.The film just tells us a story about a very nice arms dealer. A man who never thinks too deep. A man who is just making money by indirectly killing thousands. He knows he may not care too much about this.And yet one gets a very clear idea about his guilt. His relation to Baptiste (dictator and war lord) is the pivotal aspect of the story. Baptiste is dangerous, is a killer, and yet a perfect business partner. And Orlov treats him like one would with any business partner. And everyone including Orlov knows that Baptiste is a monster. One has to have a very special view of the world in order to deal with persons like Baptiste. Frightening how easy this can be achieved.And that is what makes the whole story. How easy moral can be overrun by business.A message presented in a laid back manner. And that is why it reaches the audience.",8,0,0,6 December 2007
Arrival," Disappointing
","Unfortunately arrival is in the end just another trial of Hollywood to go intellectual.The really intriguing idea of changing the perception of time and time itself by learning a language that has a circular definition of it is just plain beautiful. And linking this idea to a personal life is just great. How does a human cope with the knowledge of all things to happen? In this case getting a child that tragically dies as a teenager. Would you go on living this life?Unfortunately these things unravel only at the end. The last 10 minutes of the film are convincing. But the 1:40 before that are uninspired to right out boring. The fantastic idea is superseded by the typical Hollywood stuff. Instead of telling us a convincing personal story, perhaps even with aliens, the filmmakers decided to drown almost everything in the usual line: military investigates, scientists are summoned under their command, earth governments consider an armed conflict. This is the source of suspense and drama. Missing completely the real point.This whole setup really buries most of the movie.It is a tragedy to see this beautiful idea wasted that thoroughly. Acting is great. Cinematography is spectacular at selected few moments but generally sub par. Music is fine.",5,7,12,14 April 2017
Prometheus," Wish it had a story
","Good things first: Great visuals (really), good acting (Fassbender), no teeny-movie, dark and serious atmosphere, entertaining.Unfortunately the story sucks. I ignore all the very obvious logic problems, it is a SciFi after all.Yet all persons in the movie are very flat characters, except for the android David. It/He is in fact the only 'person' with any dimension. So whenever somebody in the film was in danger, I hardly cared. The film has a lot philosophical subplots, it seems at first: Relation between Creator and created; Parents and children; God and science; Believe and free will; Death and what is beyond; Emotions and androids; Being human; Life in the universe. A long list, and that is the problem. All these things are mentioned but never treated. It seems to me, they just put all this 'stuff' in the script, to make the movie appear (!) to be full of deep thoughts. 'God and science' mentioned, OK, make a mark on the list, go to next theme.And there is this connection to Alien. Well, it adds some thread to the story. But to my mind it is just a marketing instrument. Prometheus the prequel to Alien sells better than Prometheus.",6,6,10,21 August 2012
Godzilla," Godzilla is back
","This American Godzilla is true to its heritage. They added Hollywood budget, changed the location but kept the spirit. There are some who complain about the story. A Godzilla movie and a logical script? Sure, one would definitely expect that. Main characters and psychological depth? Absolutely necessary? The story is - of course - full of plot holes big enough to let Godzilla pass. The human characters are more or less one dimensional. But what do you expect. This is a silly monster movie. And it is really fantastic in showing the thread. For example the bridge scene, where one gets a good idea of the helplessness of man. And the film excels in showing the size of what is happening. In the last year's I have seen a lot of movies depicting the destruction of cities on a fabulous technical level. Transforers, Man of Steel, just to name a few. But never I felt the sheer size as in Godzilla. The scene where he gets on land for the first time is a masterpiece in this sense. He doesn't simply leave the sea, oh no. He evokes a tsunami first before wrecking a whole city.And as in most Toho films Godzilla is the good guy, sort of. While human efforts are futile he saves the world from monstrous muto. The director proved in 'monsters ' that he can bring alien ecosystems to life and create an eerie atmosphere. He succeeds with the muto. However they look too much like Cloverfield and too little like Japanese Toho monsters. The human storyline fortunately doesn't interfere too much with the action. Still I would have liked to see more of Godzilla. A good Godzilla movie and a must for.fans.",7,1,3,1 June 2014
Contact," Intellectually disappointing
","It was only now that I actually made it to watch this movie as a whole. I always had some kind of sympathy for the shattered parts I had seen before and I was very hopeful for this film to get the theme right, as it was based on a story of C. Sagan.Well, now I am truly disappointed.Our main character is a strict scientist, more than most I have ever met personally. She is based deeply in the philosophy of modern natural science. Citing Ocam's razor it is fairly easy to state being an atheist. And she shows some stubborn philosophical issues real atheists tend to display as well.In the end, a person like that goes on to a journey to the stars. Returning without any serious proof. The experience she has is more than doubtful. Just the notion of meeting her father on another star's shore makes it highly probable, the whole thing is just a hallucination of some sort. Maybe induced by the strange electromagnetic effects of the (alien) machine.If the main character lived up to her inner believes, she would be the first to admit. But no, she rather ignores this, and winds up with the man, who is - albeit a strictly religious person - her lover. Giving up all conviction, blending with a religious philosophy, losing herself, for a man!? Farewell to Ocam and all foundations of modern science.This is strictly unbearable, if you got any kind of believe or philosophy. There is no possible accord between religion and nowadays science. These positions are natural enemies. And Contact tries to wipe the fundamental conflict away.Of course people with contradicting philosophies can fall in love. Philosophy and even religion do not really matter in the end. Well, at least if you kept some sanity to yourself. But they do not need to blend into each other. The main character of this movie for sure would not.And I am not talking about the logical holes in the plot line. Why would national security get involved, if it takes for any message 26 years to travel to the other side? That means actually you send something and receive an answer 52 years later! Why would the government hold back information (18 hours of video recording that should not exist) if the same government has to justify the costs of 600 Trillion (!) Dollars. Ridiculous! In the end and at the end the movie falls apart. Starting up as a rather credible and accurate story about the first contact to an alien civilization. But definitely failing when the contact is made and the aftermath has to be handled.",5,8,16,23 December 2011
The Island," Big budget, little content
","Movies about cloning ought to be at least thought provoking. Unfortunately they hardly ever are.And so is 'The Island' The plot is totally absurd. Imagine, there is a company capable of producing clones. They can even control the age of the clones pretty well. They got actually more control than the cloners in 'Star Wars Episode 2' have. In Star Wars they can only make the clones grow twice as fast as humans. Whereas in 'the Island' they produce them right on the spot.But they are not enabled to keep them alive, without giving the clones a real live.And that is the plot line! The guys writing the script, Tredwell-Owen, Kurtzman and Orci, just didn't give a damn on logic. A company, having the above mentioned capabilities, is not enabled, to breed a non-clone baby. No, they produce clones, to produce the child. Which ever way you have a look on this, it is rubbish.And instead of producing clones just in time, they build a big illusion for them to live in. Yeah sure, makes sense.All right, it's a SciFi. (Did I mention, I'm a SciFi fan?) So don't let's care too much about plausibility. There are certainly more interesting aspects in the movie, aren't there? No, there is nothing interesting at all! The hero-clone meets his original. The original is a bad person! He is trying to get rid of the clone. And the good clone simply replaces the original. Doing so, by provoking the completely idiotic hit men to shoot the real human.Everyone surviving this point of the story proves to be a good person. And all together free the poor clones. Yuk! Psychology of the main characters: Implausible, unlikely, not credible. Plot line: Just for the pea-brained! Mr. McGregor recently stated, Star Wars was a big fault. Too dumb, to shallow. And what about the island? Big budget, little content!",3,1,2,14 September 2007
