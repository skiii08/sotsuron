The King's Speech," Definitely a must-see
","I already had heard good comments around this when I finally was able to see it. The King's speech is definitely an Oscar-worth movie. It shows entirely how some historical events went from a new perspective, at least to someone who knew nothing of the royal family's story before, and agree with all its academy awards, Colin Firth definitely did a great performance, along with Geoffrey Rush and the entire cast (would like to remind Guy Pearce's presence and Helena Bonham Carter, Bellatrix from the Harry Potter series).I also liked both the homour in the storytelling and the use of classical music in most of the score.Stop reading reviews, go watch it! You'll definitely enjoy it.",8,1,2,21 December 2014
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," explain me again why everyone goes around yelling about this
","I still don't understand that. Most of the people i know loves this movie saying this is the best movie ever.Let's start. I think dividing a movie in two parts is pretty much the way to kill a movie, I think that maybe whatever happens in the second part could have completed this. now it has no real conclusion. No action at all, sometimes the dumbest solution ever (katniss' sister running for the cat during the bombing). Still like slow movies, but this truly doesn't have any true event happening until second part of the movie. Like the post-apoc. atmosphere though, that 'stalker' effect given by bombing sites, but that's the only reason i rated this 5/10.",4,18,30,24 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why everyone hates the prequels
","Seriously, why everyone does that?Many people, like with the ewoks of episode VI, hate jar-jar because he's funny. I disagree with that, it's good to have some funny characters, C-3PO and R2 are funny characters too. Another thing they hate about this movie is this whole 'Bureaucrazy' thing. I ask again: why? The Political plots of the prequel trilogy outline how the Republic is close to it's collapse and transformation in the Empire. The plot is great, direction is good ( Many people say Gerge Lucas shouldn't have direct this and that he can't direct. That's wrong for many things: 1) He invented the saga and wrote the story. If you take him out you don't have star wars. 2) He also directed episode IV. 3) there's no reason to say he cant direct.) Epic battles, great effects as always. 10/10",8,2,3,22 September 2014
Gravity," why,why, why everyone follows the mass?
","I must say that this movie deserved all the Oscars it won, also for its awesome CG (consider that almost everything you see is CG, except parts of the suits and the soyuz/shenzou interiors, as i learned from the blu ray extras.).I can't understand why most of the people I've met with says this is horrible/stupid. So I start consider their arguments and tell why they're invalid.first thing i've seen written, since the trailer came out, was the fact that Bullock's deep breath is annoing and stupid. Sincerely, I want to see these people in the same situation; Bullock has a panic attack.Next, I see people argumenting with phisics from 1st high school. Now, myself I go to a school where I haven't studied phisics yet being at 2nd high school, but I hardly believe they teach you zero-g phisics in first years of high school, whetever you're not going to a special areonautic-orientated type, but this is not important; More importantly I don't get what 'wrong phisics' are these people talking about, and I think that goes too nerdily away from the point of this movie: Don't surrender ever.Next problem they have, is the plot. What's the problem? Seriously! Try yourself to create a better plot having this much of technology in space (As we have in space an ISS, Chinese stations, Had space shuttles and tons of satellites) and tell me something that truly is stupid. Some people say the effects like the one at the beginning of the movie when the shuttle comes in picture may look fake. This people haven't seen any actual footage from NASA's several programmes, that's exactly how you see a starship orbiting. and they haven't understand that everything is cgi except the actor's faces, the helmets (without visor) and the upper part of the suits!!! Then They have thousands of problems with bullock. First, that she hasn't really good practice being an astronaut. These people haven't actually been paying attention at the movie: It is said that Ryan Stone is a hospital doctor sent in space to install a prototype system developed by medical scientists and that she's at her first ship. Second, that we see her only for most of the movie. And...? Even better, it took out the ridiculous series of deaths you get in many movies.Soo... resuming: hate how people begin to use stupid arguments to hate a movie. I think this started when a few people started to spread the words that this movie sucks, and many people started to believe them or just follow the mass, just as the reason why they tell me that star wars looks fake without having seen it.",10,3,6,27 September 2014
Star Trek," great reboot
","I must say, I like better the reboot than the original series mainly because of the better effects (sorry, this series in the '90s movies deserved better effects, the old series never reached the level of star wars), but also for the more modernization of the whole.the way JJ managed to reboot the series was just perfect, he did leave a continuity without deleting anything that happened before.Smart story, good introduction of the characters, also great ending; i've watched it several times and always forget the smart plan they use to destroy their enemy.Still, this is not as good as the sequel, lacks in action sequenzes. This is the reason of the 8/10.",8,1,2,2 December 2014
Citizen Kane," This? Boring?
","Citizen Kane was the first movie I watched from the pre-war era, and maybe because I kept comparing other movies to this is why I couldn't appreciate some movies the way I liked this. Why's citizen kane this good? Because it has actual thematics even today. The whole movie is a sort of mockumentary/fake biopic of a multi-billionaire and some of the events in his life, a sort of a hunt for the scoop made by a journalist. The way the movie's plot is built is just great. Without counting the cinematographic pros that citizen kane has every other aspect was just great. To those who claim that they're cinephiles yet affirm that they got bored while watching this and fell asleep.... This film is much less slow than any Tarkovskij film, what would happen to them if they watched a Tarkovskij film? Like, they fall asleep at the opening credits?",10,6,8,31 December 2015
Memento," Clever, dark and distressing
","That is what we can call the 'Nolan effect'. Every time I saw a Nolan movie for the first time I was catched by a feeling of anxiety, almost afraid of what could happen, but also amused by the smartness of the story, except for Interstellar, which is to me so far the less violent of Nolan's works.Memento has all of these things - a smartly delivered plot, with quite mature contents and a deal of distression - at an exponentially higher level than the other movies. Not only the darkest and most bloody to me, but also the most cleverly shown: with the trick of how we see the sujet, we truly see the movie from Leonard Shelby's perspective, although knowing a little more than himself. What I found interesting was also that even if the ending in the Sujet wasn't chronologically the end, it actually did deliver a 'finale' feeling, which is remarkable. Being the first Nolan film to get some notoriety, it doesn't have stunning views as the others which are covered by the good acting of all the actors: Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss (otherwise seen in 'the Matrix'), Joe Pantoliano and even Stephen Tobolowsky's silent, almost cameo appearance worked well. The music, composed by a composer I never heard before, David Julyan, managed to bring in the right atmosphere.Homever, remember that even if it has minimal to no gore, this movie is very intense. Some of the flashbacks related to the wife's gruesome murder are disturbing, (MINIMAL SPOILERS BEGIN) and around the middle the plot's on going makes viewers start to expect that Leonard has an even darker backstory that luckily is not what we discover in the movie. (MINIMAL SPOIELRS END) Although also the actual outcome is quite dark. So I suggest a quite deal of courage to watch this movie. Again, this movie is the most intense Nolan movie from his career. On a scale from 1 to 100, If Memento is ranked 100, the dark knight is ranked 45, inception 35, and interstellar 10.",10,1,3,20 June 2015
Captain Marvel," Nostalgic Marvel movie
","Just had the opportunity to see it on an early screening in original language.This movie is very similar in concept to Rogue One: per se, it is a relatively okay movie, but a lot of elements boost up the appreciation of fans of the shared universe.Let's start with the positives.
Captain Marvel has a lot of connections to the MCU, it hints at several origin stories, shows us a number of familiar elements and characters, and also provides some very subtle connections. There's nothing that seemed to me revelatory as for Infinity War's aftermath in the plot of this film, the connections were strong with existing MCU movies instead.Deaged Nick Fury is very realistic (which gives us hopes for The Irishman), I haven't seen anything this well done in cinema so far. This film has some of the best Samuel L. Jackson comedic moments outside of Tarantino movies.Storytelling doesn't occur in a traditional, origin tale structure, but kinda starts in the middle of things, and as the plot proceeds the past emerges. I really appreciated this element.There's a number of elements that prevents me from listing this as one of the nest MCU movies.
Somehow the action scenes just didn't feel entertaining, or at least mot always. If you set aside all those nostalgic elements, and all the connections, it really doesn't feel too exciting. Somehow that 'woah' factor that Iron Man or the Avengers films had is missing. I think this is partly due to the way the character was portrayed by the filmmakers, I frankly feel she lacked that positive spark that many other female heroines have. Despite the fact that Captain Marvel was somewhat supposed to be THE incarnation of female strenght, in the end she kinda seems what commonly is defined as a Mary Sue. We have no explanation whatsoever as of how her superpowers work and exactly what can she do. I guess comic readers already knew them, but me, a simple cinephile, don't have the slightest idea of what are her powers even after seeing the film (shoot beams, fly and superstrenght?).A few words about the after-credits scenes: the first one has the sole purpose of further anticipating the next avengers movie, without really providing anything new and unexpected (though the crowd seemed to think otherwise, claps started after it), and the second one has just a comical value.",7,8,35,7 March 2019
The Hunger Games," Why everyone likes this?
","I want to start saying that I didn't read the book.Outlined that, I got to see this movie as at a point everyone I knew was going crazy because of it. Sincerely, this is not the best science fiction I've seen. Not much effects, teens killing each other... personally seems to me overrated.The idea was good, I want to outline again that I didn't read the book but also that haven't seen the sequel/s, so I'm reviewing the movie and the plot as seen in the movie, in this, single movie.First, showing teens killing each other is not very constructive, I say that being 15, and see how people like this because of its brutal side. The other reason they like this, as I heard from a fan, is because of its message, 'don't go to the dark side'- like thing. I already heard that in star wars, like the movie quote 'May the odds ever be in your favour' seems just a retaking of 'may the force be with you'.Giving this a 5 because I, despite that, really liked Peeta's camouflage tecnique",4,3,5,22 September 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," ah trekkies just nerdily insulting this
","Again a movie that is badly considered by franchise fans, what is wrong with you people!?!Many Star Trek Classic fans hate this, cause it goes too dark and is different from the original series. Too much action, too much changes.What is wrong with these people? We're 40 years later the original star trek, it's mathematical this is different. I must say I don't like the old series, not mainly because of the storyline, but mostly because it ruined even the image people have of star wars, confusing themselves between the two franchises. THat is unacceptable, Star wars is way superior to star trek in most of its points.This movie has action, great FX, smart story, real emotions (that mostly were absent in the old series), and great acting. I really see no reason to hate this, except for the only half- gory scene and the huge amount of bad-words.Overall, liked really much this movie, and think this reboot actually didn't ruin the franchise, but saved it: most of nowadays people don't like that slow-movie with awful effects thing like star trek, even worse, mistakingly consider it star wars, this way underrating Lucas' series, and this is exactly what new audiences (including me) like.",10,2,7,24 November 2014
Us," It actually was top notch
","This film isn't aimed solely or principally to entertain, it is much subtler, and requires a lot of attention of the viewer to dissect every detail.
Superficially seen, yes, it's a typical horror movie, but beneath that there's a lot of meanings, themes, foreshadowing dialogues ecc.
Unlike most of horror movies, Us does not rely on jumpscares, it creates an eerie atmoshpere and mostly relies on visual elements to emphasize such elements, something I really appreciated.
A very recurring meaning is indeed the theme of the double very interesting handled, not only with the enemies being the doppelgÃ¤ngers of the main characters, but also under other aspects, such as the duality of human nature (rational/irrational), ecc.
I really find the accusation of the story having plot holes to be nonsensical. The more I rethink about the film, the more cause-effect connections I find as to why certain things happened. It's all there, you just need to find it.
What I also really liked is how there is an almost fully afroamerican cast without the subject of the movie being racial discrimination. I hope not to be misunderstood, I am clearly in favor of diversity representation, and that's exactly why I appreciate that in this movie we are allowed to see an afroamerican family in the lead without the topic of the movie being related to their skin colour, I believe it's the best way to represent diversity correctly and inclusively.
So far, this is probably the best film released in 2019. Awards season is still to come, but I strongly believe that it will still stay among the top releases of the year.",9,4,15,4 April 2019
Insomnia," Dark despite its light scenes
","Watching first later Nolan movies, it's easy to see a decreasing amount of intensity of adult content. Warning: not sexual content, to violent and intense content. Memento was very intense, this, the next Nolan movie, is way less intense, though far higher in intensity than what you see in the dark knight trilogy.I don't know what was the original movie like, but this movie certainly was not bad. Direction managed just as in memento to bring the viewer into the character's perspective, Al Pacino acted very well, just as Robin Williams in his unusually really dark role. Visuals were very good as well, with some stunning Alaskan views.just as I said in Memento, content of this film is quite intense. To compare with other movies from Nolan, on a 1 to 100 scale: Memento is 100, Batman Begins around 30-40, Inception 35, The Dark knight 40-50, Interstellar 10, and Insomnia is a 80-90. Not that much for the amount of gore, more for the way that minimal is depicted, and how a gruesome murder is described towards the end. These two give a high-level of intensity to the movie. So expect that from it.",8,1,2,20 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Conclusion to the saga
","Many consider this the least-good part of the original trilogy, and even some fans of the saga don't like it, i'll later explain why.COnclusion to the saga. Not directed by George Lucas, like episode V. I consider it my second favourite episode. Many people hate ewoks because they're funny and from their point of view are a sacrilege to a dramatic saga. I disagree with this. Ewoks are funny. We already had funny characters in the saga, even in the Original trilogy: C-3P0 and R2-D2. A good thing of Star Wars is that sometimes you laugh too, and in my opinion that's right, good.SPOILERAnother thing they hate is when darth vader has his mask taken off, because that loses his dramaticity and his mightiness of being Darth Vader. I really don't understand that: It's a point that could touch you, when Luke's father shows how he does look like. It also shows that Vader isn't that terrific, evil being. He's got a complicated story. It makes Vader the most complex character of the saga. So I think that is the main point of the saga. Hating that point makes know that you didn't understand the meaning of all this.",10,0,2,22 September 2014
Interstellar," Interstellar: a space odyssey
","First of all I want to remind that this movie is completely different from any previous Nolan movie I've seen, exception for a few solutions of storytelling Nolan uses frequently.Nolan himself admitted this movie is inspired both by Tarkovskij's Mirror and Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, and I must say that last title's influence is very evident throughout the entire movie, full with references, without that downgrading this movie at all. I saw myself some references in Solaris (1972) too. The movie, if you didn't expect, is a slow movie. it has some deep messages, most of which told by the characters, and has incredibly well done visual effects. Each actor's performance was great, starting from McConaughney, Jessica Chastain and Michael Caine, to Matt Damon's cameo, strangely uncredited though of its own importance in the movie. The music of Hans Zimmer surprised me completely, even though was said to be original and new. It has nothing to do with Zimmer's previous scores, and in certain points reminds of 2001: A space odyssey.I can see, strangely, how this movie's direction was originally thought to be given to Spielberg; certain scenes give that thrilling fear that Spielberg uses in his own movies, though storytelling and the way the entire film is shot does not resemble Spielberg's way of direction at all.I come back to the visual effects. They were stunning, just as the ideas and concepts that have been put in this movie. This movie, as I already said, is very clearly inspired by 2001, but is less enigmatic and maybe more adapted to present audiences. It does have more science than 2001, more deepness of the message than 2001, and, to me, it's what 2001 should have been, not taking away respect to the movie that is considered by me the founder of the Science Fiction as a true, modern cinematic genre. I'd give a 11/10 to this movie if I only could!!!",10,1,5,16 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," what's wrong with haters?
","Again, many people hate the prequels because someone told them to do so. That's the most stupid thing I've ever heard.Episode II is outstanding. It begins to explain how Original Trilogy characters became how they are. Again, many people hate this. Firtst thing they hate is Hayden Christiensen, saying he can't act. OK, I agree he's not the best actor i've seen, but truly it's not about his acting, it's his role, Anakin Skywalker, to be strange. A character in dilemma with being good or bad. Many people hate how the love story between Ani and Padmè came out. Because it doesn't look real. Yeah, they don't talk like people nowadays about love, but if you haven't noticed star wars has a way of expression different than standard chatting. So that's not a reason to hate this. Many people hate how Yoda duels Dooku, because that 'takes away that feeling that we had in episode V of him'. Wrong, totally. Just as in episode V, we see here how powerful he is despite he's small. Some people complain about the shape of the starships and settings, as they look different. Of course they do, they have to, they're starships from a different era's end!Concluding, again, this movie is down rated, as with all the star wars movies and prequel movies. giving 9/10 just because of the hayden christiensen section of the review",9,15,26,22 September 2014
Forrest Gump," Not overrated, just people have no heart
","After my father did a course during the which there was quite some talk about autism, how it works and such I finally got to see again this movie that I had seen only once at a very young age. There are several things (E.G. /MILD SPOILER/ the fact that Forrest is very good at Ping pong because he's able to focus on the ball) that suggest that Forrest is not stupid and retarded, more autistic. Which basically destroys all the accusations of the movie being a 'Sentimentalistic ode to stupidity and ignorance'.There are various things with which you can explain why 'Forrest Gump' is truly one of the best movies ever. 1st is the acting, not only of Tom Hanks, but also of several other cast members, highlighting Gary Sinise. Another thing to praise is the music. Alan Silvestri truly was able to touch with this movie's music.Some consistent criticism is driven towards the story. The fact here is the problem with understanding that this is what they call 'Modern fable', a story set nowadays that is meant to be touching and talks about what happened in that time, similarly to 'The legend of 1900' or 'the curious case of benjamin button'. This genre seems to not be understood by a pretty consistent number of viewers, therefore receives a limited amount, but present amount of hatred.Then, when I understood that some haters of this movie are angry because it seems to have stolen the accademy award away from other movies such as the shawshank redemption and pulp fiction I understand that it's just unreasoned hatred. Go watch it, it's truly wonderful.",10,5,8,1 July 2015
The Bourne Ultimatum," Best in the trilogy
","Seriously this is the best one in the series.Great action sequences, a clever story and we finally get to know everything about the mystery around Jason Bourne's origins.MILD SPOILERS BEGIN after almost the entire story being set in Europe, we do get to move in U.S. for a bit. The final scene of The bourne supremacy comes up around the middle of this part, which is a little confusing. MILD SPOILERS ENDSo, in the end this concludes in a very good manner, even referencing a quote from The Bourne Identity, the trilogy of films.",10,1,2,26 April 2015
Oblivion," Down rated, it's great!
","Oblivion is really one of my favourite Sci-fi movies from the last decade, and I can't but praise it. The first wonderful thing about Oblivion is the visuals. They're just unordinary and wonderfully stunning. Watching this film in blu-ray quality is just appealing. The unusual post-apocaliptic depiction, next to the high tech shown presents an unusually working paradox. Story-wise, it is advisable to know as less as possible about the plot. While the movie is really modern, its plot is as good as some of the original 70s-80s films - just maybe with a different pace and surely with different visuals. Cast seems perfect in every way. They didn't need too many actors for this film, and they chose everyone just right for their role. There's not really so musch to be told. This movie is one of the rare cases I've rated a movie 10/10 without it being considered a masterpiece of a film. It just makes me hope for seeing Kosinski doing more films in the future.",10,3,4,22 September 2014
The Last Legion," okay, this must be remade
","I'm sorry, can't give this a high mark, as I've seen some people liked it, others didn't.First of all, maybe I'm the only one that actually went reading the book by Valerio Massimo Manfredi before seeing this. That book is various times better than this movie, also really different (VMM is a historian, we must say that) : except some concepts of the movie, some of the events, it has nothing in common. Now, no problem on the absence of gore, that's okay, but with the realism of fights. halph of what we've seen was too pirates of the Caribbean-like fighting with no realism. I must blame the direction here. If they were following the book, they could have done a true blockbuster of this. Still, ben kingsley managed to save this some how.",4,1,4,2 December 2014
The Bourne Identity," So, afterall, something happens in Europe too
","I was so glad to have an action movie that is entirely set in Europe. Not everything happens in the states afterall...First of all, this movie shows a thing that I negatively reviewed in hunger games, that is well used here instead: shaky shots. We have plenty of them, but while in hunger games they often were used in a too confusing way, here we have a smarter use of them: you can figure out well what is going on despite the shake. that's wonderful.Can't be that much of a fan of the music and sometimes of Matt Damon's acting homever. Luckily, everything else fills in the small gap well.Great choice of locations and great fight scenes, together with the absolute no existence of high tech gadgets therefore its realism make me like really much this movie.",9,5,5,26 April 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," an emotional beginning
","WHile I was first introduced to the Middle-earth movies through The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, this was the second film from the saga that I watched.While watching it on the extended edition expands the story so much that sometimes it feels a little too extended, it's my second favourite LOTR movie. What made me definitely like it is the way it gets really emotional towards the end. You'll understand that only by watching the film.I'm not a huge fantasy fan, but Tolkien's universe is one I loved, and this is one of the movies that introduced me to the whole world.",10,1,1,7 January 2016
The Revenant," Not just a 'Revenge' film
","Some explanations to why 'The Revenant' didn't win the Best Motion Picture Oscar were that it is just a revenge film. I hardly disagree. While the story basis is a survival and redemption story, they way the story's told makes it much more. Also there are some other themes than revenge dealt with in this film, such as native Americans, and the exploitation of their lands.We're constantly introduced to stunning visuals of nature, wonderful single-take scenes, alternated with some singular dream sequences. I remember that, when they adverstised the film, they constantly paragonated this to Tarkovskij films. After seeing the film, I can say that the influence can be spotted well. The gore level is quite high, gratuitous and realistic. I feel like it's more gory every time I see it. I don't really like explicit violence depicted in films, but that's just necessary in this particular movie because of the story. Speaking of casting, I feel it was perfectly done, and no one seemed in the wrong place. I'm not sure we can call this Leo's best portrayal, but he definitely acted well, together with his antagonist, Tom Hardy. The music wasn't a stroke of genius, but fitted in the film well, and added emotional layers to it.Lastly, The Revenant is a great film, and soon made it to my personal top 10. But this is a film for those movie-watchers that look at movies as a form of art, not just some mean of entertainment. It's quite slow, definitely not action packed, but also very intense.",10,4,7,7 May 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," I couldn't believe it - but this is TRULY the best
","Seeing the M:I movie franchise, between III and Ghost protocol, I believe there had been an escalation of always more exciting action scenes but also more catching stories. This film is no less. It starts not much time after Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, mentioning things that happened there, and starts in an explosive way.Watching this movie I realised it got more tense than any other M:I movie I've seen, even more tense than (SPOILERS AROUND THE OTHER FILMS START) The computer room break-in from Mission Impossible, the Burj Khalifa climbing from Ghost Protocol or the second half of Mission: Impossible III. This movie kept a tense starting from the first scene, although easing it thanks to Benji's usual jokes.Great action scenes, great acting, but also a clever story. I must say that I want to see other films directed by this guy.The reason most of ratings are low is that most of the viewers wanted more action scenes such as chases or incredible-sounding stunts. Don't listen at those reviewers, or their rating, that's not at all what this movie is. I can guarantee that unless you won't get bored",9,0,4,9 September 2015
Dunkirk," Why this could actually be one of the best war films even after accepting its weaknesses
","Dunkirk is one of the rare cases a film receives a huge critical acclaim and a mixed reaction from the audience. Some reviews arrive to consider the praise for the film being based solely on the name of its director, Christopher Nolan.The main criticisms that Dunkirk receives is: poor character development, repetitivity of the action, little emotionality.Dunkirk indeed doesn't really have character development. This is a fact. You get to know something briefly about Mark Rylance's backstory and his son's friend George, but nothing about anyone else. There is a reason for that: Dunkirk relies mostly on its fast pace, which simply does not give enough time to fully develop characters the way, for example, The Thin Red Line did with Stavros, or Saving Private Ryan did with John Miller. I dare to say that's not something the film needed at all. Stopping the story from taking its course so that Harry Styles and Fionn Withehead talk about their backstory and are more identified as characters would have taken away from the whole suspense feel the film expects the audience to receive. We got to love John Miller because of the night-time church moment, or the past reveal scene, or the scene in which he talks to Ryan prior to the final battle. These scenes are also those which make Saving Private Ryan a 2h40m film, with about 1h40m of action.Repetitivity of action is a criticism I understood while watching the film. As many of the readers might know, this film tells three story lines contemporarily: one that lasts days, on ground, one that lasts less than a day, on the ship called 'Moonstone' and another that lasts less than an hour, on the spitfires. These storyline become increasingly interconnected through the film, until the final climax. What sometimes happens is that you see the same action from a different perspective ten minutes after you have seen it from another. So, the film's first sequence that involves Spitfires has three of them flying over the sea, and there is a sailor ship in the corner of the shot. 30 minutes later you will realize that the ship was the Moonstone when you see that same thing from the perspective of the people on the ship. There are several of these repetitions. That's why some viewers felt it repetitive: most of the time (expecially the ship scenes and the plane scenes) they saw simply the exact same scenes. Anyone familiar with Nolan must know how he either did complex story lines on a linear plot, but is more known for the non-linearity of Memento, The Prestige and so on. Dunkirk is following this habit in a truly outstanding and clever way.Dunkirk had no 'Earn this.' scene, or any moving John Williams score. The ending had some emotionality to it, but no other scene in the film. Dunkirk doesn't want you to cry. It wants you to feel the suspense the soldiers felt. Up until the last minute or so, not a moment of relief is left to the audience, and this is conveyed through the fast pace of the film and its very intense Zimmer score. Taken alone, the score is very similar to others he composed, but it does what is needed for the film's intensity.As for accuracy, I looked up the main things about the Dunkirk evacuation before watching the film. A lot of elements are slightly mentioned or implied. E.g. the french defending the perimeter, or the existence of a second dock for the french, overall the sense of chaos is fully present, and the film delivers it well. There are some minor inaccuracies or simplifications, true, such as the German planes' scheme colour being one that they didn't use until some time later, which apparently was an intentional choice, but all the main details of the Dunkirk evacuation where there, in my view.When the movie finished, I was relieved through the ending, but it delivered the intensity and climax that no other war movie gave. And Dunkirk did this without showing a single nazi soldier or without true warfare scenes: this is why Dunkirk should be considered one of the best war films made so far.",10,6,15,2 August 2017
Gandhi," Gandhi
","When it comes to biopic, there's always some skepticism: people try to find inaccuracies, complain about those, and such. I don't know how much was true and how much was untrue in Gandhi's depiction in this film, but certainly it makes me feel that they wanted to be the most accurate possible. Gandhi is very well portrayed by Ben Kingsley, in various scenes you get tricked and believe it's the actual Gandhi, especially in the second half of the film. It's a really long film, and has even got an intermission (wich allows it also to divide it for two separate occasions). Gandhi's teachings portrayed in the film are definitely some of the best things in this film, they definitely allow to get deep meanings from the story.",9,1,1,7 January 2016
Duck You Sucker," Silly at times, dead serious at others
","While not being at all my favourite Sergio Leone film, I still believe this movie is one of those you should have seen to consider yourself a proper cinephile. 'Duck, you sucker' starts with a guy peeing, something kind of strange in a western film. In fact, the first scene that comes after that introduces very well and seriously one of the biggest themes in the movie, the discrimination of the poor and the Mexican revolution. Then we have the encounter between the two main characters, and a whole alteration of really silly, humorous and childish moments to very serious scenes and events. This film depicts violence of the Mexican dictatorship as crudely as many films depict Nazis. Homever, it also shows an aspect of revolutions not always obvious. As Mao-Tze tung'squote says at the beginning, 'Revolution is an act of violence'. The film, through the experiences of John as an I.R.A. terrorist shown in flashbacks, paralleling events in the film, how inglorious and dirty were actually the really hosannated revolutions, making the viewer feel at the end similarly to John, who says at a point in the film, 'I don't believe in anything but dynamite.' This movie though is not anti-revolutionary or justifies dictatorships. 'Duck you sucker' has a quite complex theme and seriousness, next to some really silly and childish situations or jokes, and an unmemorable score which are what make the movie fall down to mark 8/10. Every Sergio Leone fan should try to understand it homever.",8,1,2,26 April 2016
Gone with the Wind," Technically good, story-wise nonsense on the second part.
","It is really difficult to review a movie negatively that is considered universally a masterpiece.From a technical point of view, Gone with the wind was well done. Really good shots, acting done well by everyone. I particularly liked the visuals with the rose clouds.Also, the story was great for almost all the notable lenght of the film. The first three hours made sense and were enjoyable, especially the part regarding the civil war in the middle, and this actually saved this film from getting a 5 rating in my list and made it got a 6.What frankly seemed to make no sense to me was the second portion of the story. It might be caused by something that has been taken out of the book, or just me because I'm used to coherent plots like Nolan films or Citizen Kane. Until pretty much the scene where Rossella decides to marry Rhett, it actually all worked, and would have worked on later too. What I refuse to believe is that a girl who already managed to survive hunger during the civil war by hard work would behave as childishly as Rossella does in the last hour of the movie. The ultimate ending, with Rhett leaving the moment Rossella realises she doesn't love Ashley (something that should have happened when Rhett left to London, about 30 minutes before) and particularly her famous quote just made me question why did I spend four hours watching a movie which had practically no ending. Because that's not an ending.",7,3,11,28 December 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The desolation of smaug: extended edition
","I just had to go spoilerific here, it is difficult to talk spoiler-free about this particular chapter of the trilogy.Because the previous film spent three hours around a relatively small amount of events, this movie had to deal with way more. Beorn, Mirkwood spiders, Lake-town, Smaug... and also a lot of the added material from other sources (LOTR novels) like Dol Guldur. This movie has certainly more plot complications than the previous ones, also more expansions to the original 'The hobbit' book, but still manages to make no mistakes story- wise. Yet, there are plenty of strange criticisms to this movie.The Relationship between an elf and a man had already been discussed in LOTR, so I don't see why a relationshp between Tauriel and Kili (Or Fili?) would be a huge problem. Another overused complaint is 'Terrible' CGI. I think many viewers haven't seen 'Terrible' CGI in their life, the one that looks really terrible and fake. For references, I propose to watch: the creature from 10.000 B.C., certain dinos from the Jurassic Park trilogy, the final train in Back to the future III, Early scenes in The Phantom Menace and... last but not least... oliphants from Lord of the rings: the Two Towers. A conftrontation between those CGI animations and this shows how CGI was well done in this film. On the expansions in the extended edition: they worked well. The extended editions of the hobbit trilogy provide of a new subplot regarding a ring of the dwarfs, and the inclusion of Thrain in the Dol Guldur section was something I particularly appreciated.My great problem (And the reason it's not getting a 9) is the ending: it was just bad to walk out of the theater two years ago with a such ending. I think the solution would've been to put the dragon entirely in the last movie. But, afterall, if you have 5 hours and 40 mins, you can watch The battle of the five armies right after the desolation of smaug thus having a proper ending to the story. Or just go and read the book.",8,0,2,28 December 2015
Batman Begins," Deserves more attention than what it currently gets
","Being this my first Christopher Nolan movie, but not only for that reason, I personally think this is the second best installment in the Dark Knight trilogy, even though its rating on IMDb seems making believe that it's on the other hand the worst.In this version of the batman story we get a quite realistic-looking, dark and adult superhero movie. This first part homever is the less gory, has gore level 0, still being dark and not an all-kids-movie. Locations used for the movie just worked perfectly, acting by all the involved actors - Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson and so on - was just brilliant. The music also gave it the right vibe.As the only unreal thing I've found was a threat towards the end which in real-life would have worked differently, This first part of the batman's journey was to me a great movie. I would give it a 9/10, but due to it's 8.3 rating I must balance the rating out",10,3,4,13 July 2015
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An unexpected journey: extended edition
","In this review I'll consider the extended edition of the film. The hobbit, in my opinion, is an example of a book-based movie that has been expanded and modified respect the book in a positive way. Various things differ from the original 'The hobbit' novel, many of the things shown in the movie are only mentioned in either the hobbit or the fellowship of the ring, some other stuff was added without appearing at all in the Tolkien books. Other than cowing cash, this is why a such short novel's movie adaptation required a division in three movies: the story got expanded so much that the amount of events couldn't fit in a single movie but required further divisions. Also said expansions made a bigger bondage of the hobbit trilogy to the Lord of the Rings trilogy as it would've had otherwise. The Hobbit: an unexpexcted journey is greatly entertaining, even if it is 3 hours long. Homever, understanding the importance of certain scenes might require a view of either at least 'the fellowship of the ring' or the entire LOTR trilogy. There's nothing I can criticize, not even the extensive use of CGI, because it just worked well (better than in 'The Two Towers'), the well-done acting of the actors, or the music. Everything just worked well together, and made the movie really entertaining despite the lenght of it. The only problem with 'an unexpected journey' is the lenght that doesn't allow to watch the movie that often.",9,1,5,28 December 2015
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," One of the less-graphic ones
","I particularly liked this entry to the mission impossible series first of all because it's the perfect example of how a movie can be enjoyable and exciting without being gory.Not going to tell about the plot, that's pretty evidently told in other reviews and even showed out a bit by posters and such. First of all it's good to note that this is Brad Bird (The incredibles)'s first live action film. An enough well-conceived plot, not too complicate, but still interesting, is well brought on by the cast featuring Jeremy Renner as a new entry to mission: impossible (It's ridiculous how he's a secret agent in both this series, both the Bourne series and in Marvel Cinematic Universe), together with already seen faces such as Simon Pegg.Tom Cruise's stunts, the good choice of locations, and the improbable high-tech gadgets make the whole thing very interesting, with quite a few jokes, though most of things are, in fact, impossible.I believe that even if you're a Bourne series fan you'll like it. Relation between Mission: Impossible and The Bourne is similar to Marvel and the Dark Knight trilogy. KIn both cases the second series looks more realistic, but the first is still fun to watch.It's obviously the realism lack that makes me give an 8 and not higher, because I have to confront this with the Bourne series that is quite real, even though I enjoy both almost on the same level.",8,1,2,25 April 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Its strenght are the parallels
","its strenght lies in the parallelsI've seen Rise several times, and it wasn't until my latest view that I realized its true strenght, which are the parallels it sets with the original '68 film. I always considered, and still consider, Rise the weakest chapter, between this and Dawn. Now, however, I see it as a better film than I did before.On the surface, Rise can seem a quite average 'origin' movie, but despite its visual style isn't that interesting or distinctive, and the CGI flawed mostly in the first half of the film. What it does right, though, is to connect emotionally the viewer with the main character, Caesar. Andy Serkis demonstrated how well can Mo-Cap be used to portray a CG character while still using an actor. You can see in Caesar often Serkis, and he proves that the talent of an actor can emerge even when he portrays a Computer Generated Character. As for parallels with the original 1968 movie, there are plenty I noticed. The most evident one is the inversion of quotes between Caesar shouting 'No!' for the first time, and Tom Felton's character, whom quotes Heston's 'Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!' right before. Caesar being imprisoned in a similar facility to that where Charlton Heston's character was in the first one, though inverted in roles, is also a recalling to the first film. When Caesar leads his rise, he imprisons two humans in cages, a foreshadowing of what will happen in the future. During the rampage through San Francisco, the police strongly reminds of the soldier Apes in the first film. There's a slight animalist facet in this film as well, even though we know that the sequels are not really animalist films but more sort of allegoric in an Orwellian 'Animal Farm' fashion.Again, I prefer Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to this film. Rise of the Planet of the Apes provides, though, a good enough introduction to the story.",7,1,1,18 July 2017
Beasts of No Nation," A must-see Netflix Original
","Beasts of No Nation is an essential film to see: the first Netflix Original ever produced is also a very good film about modern african warfare, and the ultimate film about children soldiers. Beasts is a very hard pill to swallow. It isn't particularly gory (The Last King of Scotland, for example, is way harder to watch in terms of gore), but much of the violence that can be seen is utterly crude, especially because it is often performed by brainwashed children. It is definitely a very hard R, mainly due to its theme.Nonetheless, Beast doesn't focus much on battle scenes. There are a few, but not very long or massive, mostly guerrilla-style battles. The focus is on the development of the main character, Agu, rather than on action scenes of sort. I assume the role of Agu wasn't a particularly hard one, but the child-actor playing the character gave him much gravitas, especially in some of the final scenes. Idris Elba also performed with intensity as the Comandant of the Battalion. I loved Season one of True Detective, and Fukunaga again orchestrated wonderfully quite a set of single-take scenes here aswell (though not as long as the famous one from the tv show). Photography sometimes brought eccellent imagery to look at.While the final 15 minutes or so didn't completely feel conclusive, I would say that, as of the date of this review (August 2018), Beasts is perhaps the best Netflix Original film so far released. The only other film that might compete for the title is Hell or High Water. Following this first release, there have been very few outstanding Netflix films (to list some good ones: Hell or High Water, Mudbound, Annihilation, The Meyerowitz Stories) and tons of very bad releases (Spectral, Death Note, Mute, The Cloverfield Paradox and so on). Let's hope that the 2018 fall season brings many such good Netflix Original films as Beasts of no Nation.",9,3,3,26 August 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Least good in the series (minimal spoilers)
","Somehow the two towers, despite featuring some of the greatest battles in the LOTR trilogy, is the movie I like the least out of the three. In the extended edition it's just really, really long. I can handle Tarkovskijs, so usually I don't have problem with long films. There's a flashback that allows us to see Boromir at Gondor before going to the council of Elrond, which might have been unnecessary, as we learn about his and his brother's singular relationship with their father in the next chapter, that eats up a lot of the extended edition. While I understand that this is a 2002 movie, and Gollum was well portrayed both by Andy Serkis and the CG department, I don't like some of the CGI in this film. Those oliphants in a scene just look fake. Personally, I believe that ILM did some better job on attack of the clones, despite even Episode II of the Star Wars prequel trilogy lacks of some realism.The two towers was a movie I liked, just didn't like as much as the other films in the trilogy.",10,0,1,7 January 2016
Schindler's List," The worrying amount of 1/10s is why we still need this film and holocaust movies in general
","The first time I've seen it, Schindler's list didn't give me much of an impression. It was horrific, black and white, and I was 15. Now, after I got myself quite a cinematographic culture, feeling the urge to identify Spieblerg's masterpiece, I came back to this movie. I knew it was rated as one of the best films generally, ever, but when I took a look at the reviews, I became really worried. Most of the 1/10 ratings bring reasonless motivations for this film's criticism. The main points of criticism that I saw are the following: 1) it manipulates facts; 2) presents a too distinct line between good jews and evil Nazis; 3) too emotional; 4) money grab; 5) 'Holocaust is bad, we already knew it' (and this is an almost exact quote);1) the claims for this point of criticism are that it portrays a positive figure of Oskar Schindler, exaggerates several aspects of the holocaust, and portrays essentially bad Nazis (we to this latter point in 2)); Let's get this straight: unlike some reviewers claim, Oskar Schindler didn't end up as an enriched Industrialist, as some reviewers wrongly claim. In other words, he didn't earn off the holocaust anything. On the contrary, he spent his entire fortune on bribes and corruption acts in order to aid his Jewish workers. He even had to escape to Argentina, as many Nazi officers did after WWII. As for the claims of overly dramatisation, that is certainly an aspect of the film. There are a few scenes which are not accurate (e.g. the shower scene - in real life, jews didn't fear the gas chamber as they where purposely misinformed). Generally, though, I didn't see that much of an overly dramatization. Most of the times, the film presented simply factual events. Jews were in fact killed and persecuted, there's nothing overly dramatized. Concentration camps where truly such bloody places as seen in the film. Instead, maybe it even downgraded violence quite a lot., still being incredibly bloody as a film.2) Good jews vs. bad Nazis; I remember Hans Landa's monologue from the beginning of Inglorious Basterds, which centered on jews being rats in the sense that they're generally a population that could figure out a solution easily. Do not get me wrong here (obviously Landa stereotypes this immensely), but this is portrayed often, mainly in the first portion of the film. Jews going to the Synagogue to buy and sell instead of praying, some jews that join the police force and essentially collaborate with the Nazis, and some jews fight each other when hiding away during the ghetto persecution scene. I clearly would not say that all jews are good nor that all German soldiers are bad, but that shouldn't be a matter to be portrayed in a holocaust film. To see an avid jew, go watch 'A Christmas Carol'. As for 'bad Nazis', I'd like to clear out again what is Nazional-Socialism. It was an extremist, right-wing movement that enhanced, in this case, Germany's national identity and superiority on the base of racial distinction, and urged violence on anyone that would not be member of the 'superior' race. This movement, along with fascism, attracted a great deal of fanatics. I'd like to suggest the view of 'Novecento', which similarly depicts the rise of fascism in Italy and its ruthless cruelty, carried on by it he insane and violent individuals which joined the party in the early twenties. I know that one movie depicted a Nazi soldier's moral division during WWII, called 'Onore e Lealtà', which has low reviews for the same reason that prevents this film from portraying 'good' Nazis: it is kind of dangerous, and can easily turn in a glorification of Nazis. Nonetheless, most of the cruelty is carried through a notorious war criminal, Amon Goeth. 3) Spielberg is of Jewish origins. As a filmmaker, he's considered this story very personal. Moreover, he is notorious for being emotional in his serious films. 4) It is well known that Spielberg chose to renounce for his fee as he considered it 'blood money'. Of course studios have to do a profit of their movies, but film is still a form of art. Movie makers of Spielberg's caliber do films without a simple capitalistic view of making money, but with the purpose of making an art work. Schindler's list is not a fancy action blockbuster, if nothing else, its black and white colouring identifies it as an art film. Add the fact the Spielberg felt personal about this story, and you'll realise how empty this claim is.5) This film was released in 1993; I personally don't know many outstanding holocaust films from before 1993 (certainly a lot from after 1993), or if there were, they certainly weren't as bold as this one. A black and white film about a crude subject that keeps the viewer's attention for 3 hours and 15 minutes. Think about it. I personally believe that, unlike other films (this includes my favourite holocaust film, Son of Saul), gives a such wide view on the holocaust. This film shows most of the aspects of the holocaust, some overrdramatised, but nonetheless represented. It is really stupid to see this movie as unnecessary. Conclusively, I'd like to point out that 6 million jews died due to the Holocaust. The only bigger genocide I know of is that of the native Americans, 18 million only in northen America. Seeing so many 1/10 reviews that base their claims on this being basically Jewish propaganda is worrying, especially considering the rise of right-wing ideologies that happened in the latter years. Are we forgetting history? I hope not. And, in case that's the truth, it's films like Schindler's list that remind us of that.",9,49,88,24 September 2017
The Bourne Legacy," Just enjoy it.
","I noticed there's a quite extended fanbase complaining about the existence of this movie. If you liked the previous ones, there is a quite big possibility you might like this one too. From cinematrographical point of view and action, it's of a very similar tone as the first trilogy of movies. The main difference is what makes people not like this movie: you don't have Jason Bourne as the main character, instead Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner. Because of this I've seen in many reviews an overly though criticism. First of all, the slightly sci-fi like twist of the film. Which is really slight. Seriously, mission impossible is truly sci-fi. This had a 1/100 amount of sci-fi content which made many people hate it. I guess The bourne viewers mostly are sci-fi haters. I'm not, but still I can assure that compared to other movies the sci-fi content is extremely limited, and is not visual too. Besides, this Sci-fi content I'm talking about, is not that 'impossible'. Yet another thing about the bourne legacy is that it seems more a new beginning to a trilogy, rather than a follow-up to the bourne ultimatum. The bourne ultimatum was quite a concluding movie.Anyhow, if you don't have these limitations, you'll find out that you will quite like the bourne legacy.",9,1,1,1 July 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Quite Enjoyable
","This, again, is not that bad as many users write of. The Amazing Spider-man is to me a quite good reboot. If previous movie was more about the origins, this is much more for a super-hero clash-down movie, mixed with a romance-plot enough sturdy and believable.What definitely makes this movie is again the theatricality of the villain, and of most of the battles.Something that with the previous trilogy could not be done, is a huge expansion that makes possible the making of more than a trilogy, I could explain with this the reason that the Avengers plot-line is not matching with spidey's anywhere.I'd say that comic-fans might like this, and also people that haven't grown up with the old trilogy (I myself was too young at the time).Music is something very electro-tecno like, and I wondered that Hans Zimmer actually worked on that. I guess he did the job taking a bit of his free-time, while working on that gorgeous score that he did for Interstellar.",7,0,2,21 December 2014
Back to the Future Part III," best sci-fi comedy ever, best in the series
","You can't review each movie alone, the trilogy is so bond together that it's impossible.Must say that this is one of the most memorable Sci-fi comedies or movies related to time- travel in the whole film making history. The story's great, you'll love the plot. Dr. Brown's explanations make sure that even the most complex things could be understood by everyone. You'll get excited for all the high-tense scenes like never, even after seeing it several times. That's one of the best things about the movie. Alan Silvestri's score is just great, gives an emotional touch like not many scores do.Now, a little problem comes to the fx. instead of using models like in star wars (what also made star wars win Oscars for the effects) they started using CG, just CG technology wasn't yet so perfectioned in 80s-90s like nowadays. That's a little problem though, the movie's not overloaded with these FX at all. Also, I think this chapter is the best in the series, has the biggest emotional plot.",9,3,3,3 December 2014
Event Horizon," Could have been developed much better
","It's been a while since I've reviewed a film on IMDb, but on this one I felt the urge to do so. Event Horizon has a well-thought premise, which simply fails to become anything good. The 'starship in distress' trope has been used in many films, and much better. One such film was Solaris.The fact is, I enjoyed Event Horizon's first half or so. It had some stupid jump scares, all right, but until then, the mystery was well executed. I believe the story started to get stupid and ridiculous when a certain video showed up.Who's seen Solaris (mind, the 1972 Tarkovskij film) might remember a similar plot: a Space station near a planet reports of certain anomalies that occur on board, as well as the breakdown of the scientists working on the station, and a Psichologist, Kris, is sent. When the Kris gets aboard, a long series of really unsettling and scary events and circumstances ignite to the viewer, and what's relevant, with almost no gore. Some might say Solaris is boring, but, damn it isn't. It's very scary, and also much deeper than many movies. Now, Solaris is also a masterpiece of cinema. Is it fair to confront this film and Solaris?The fact is, that the story of the two films is similar. Sam Neill's character is in this movie's first half in almost the same situation as Kevin, there's the theme of the unknown and the alien dealt with in a similar manner, the setting is almost entirely one space ship / station's corridors.So whats's the difference? The way the material was dealt with. Solaris is clever, unsettling, lets the viewer have deep thoughts but also freaks him out. Event Horizon is, on the other hand, full of Jumpscares (a quite cheap way of scaring the viewer), mentions superficially some aspects that might have been dealt more deeply (e.g. what happened to the ship), and destroys all the premises it built up in the last 30 minutes, letting go to a flow of endless gore (another cheap way of scaring the viewer). Even the ending wasn't satisfying. All the actors did the best they could, Sam Neil for example executed well his role, even in the final arc, even if I personally hated that part of the film. VFX and photography, for a 97 movie, were fine-ish, as well, also I remember that I appreciated some shots and even the set designs. The technical side of the film was well executed. What went wrong, terribly wrong, was the story, and the ultimate meaning of the film.The movie's first 20 minutes made me want to give it an 8/10, the next 30 minutes a 6/10. The final arc was worth a 3/10. Therefore, I feel right to give it a 4.75/10, approximated via IMDb rating system to 5/10.",5,1,2,11 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The most divisive star wars film
","I've finished seeing the film an hour and a half ago, utterly shocked. I could not decide whether I liked the film or was disappointed. I'm serious: this film can really give serious doubts on their capacity of judgement.What I think many people could be afraid of, is whether this film is similar or not to V. 
I did not see many, very little similarities, in fact. More similarities where there with VI, if I must say, but any similarity to previous film dissipated in the final 45 minutes. It is also to note that such similarities are very slight, especially when compared to what seen in VII.Let's start with the technical aspect, which was obviously outstanding. I really liked the overall style and the various choices made by Johnson there. Special effects where great, especially in aspects I didn't expect, that of the practical alien characters. I cannot but praise Johnson's techincal capacity in directing action, in the photography and much else.
I am still not sure about Johnson's capacity in story writing. There was an entire story arc, which, although included some very great scenes, ultimately had quite a few plot holes and unhappy solutions. I'd like to point out that I noticed aforementioned plot holes after quite a few discussions, so it's not that I'm like those reviewers that see plot holes everywhere. But I have to be honest, the story arc that follows the Resistance was not outstanding at all.On the other hand, the backbone of the film was truly outstanding. I won't spoil anything, I will only state that a new light is shaded on the entire course of Good vs. Evil, of the picture you get of the prequels, and much else. Some very bold story decisions where made, unexpected at all. Ultimately, a very interesting outcome is provided for a possibly strong episode IX. Finally, having seen it, I find VIII very divisive. I can understand both those who praise it and those who will hate it. It was certainly better than VII, but I'm not yet sure if it lives up to the OT, even though it sometimes seems even better than aforementioned films. But when it does not do so, it becomes at moments a quite bland film, especially during the arc that focuses on the Resistance. If I have to choose, I'd say it is a good movie.",10,49,178,13 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," OK... it reminds of... but it's not star wars
","Now, I went to see this because it was hired as the new star wars, and being a star wars fan myself wanted to check that out. I must say that it truly does remind of star wars, even having many differences (no outline of main characters being sharply good or bad, much energy-blaze stuff that personally don't like much, use of bad-words and of modern music) Strangely, and I wasn't expecting that, it does have an emotional touch to it, and not just action sequences.What really blocked back this from becoming 'the new star wars' was really the music. It's not at all touching and epical as the John Williams score we hear in star wars, and the lack of truly epical duels, like the star wars lightsaber duels (here it's made by star-lord banally taking an orb in his hand without dying) I'm so gonna laugh if it turns out that Thanatos is star-lord's father. giving this an 8/10",7,0,3,21 November 2014
The Imitation Game," Not excellent but not terrible
","I don't know in what amount this movie is historically inaccurate, as most of reviews claim, so I'm judging by what I can judge. For much time I thought this actually won the Oscar for best picture, then I realized it hadn't. (I have sometimes prejudices towards latter Oscar-winning films.)The first thing I liked about it was the non-linear story-telling, partly similar to Christopher Nolan's movies. Other than that the story manged to be touching the way it was told, although it included the theme of homosexuality with which I'm not completely comfortable. In addition, it managed to be exciting, without any action. Definitely Benedict Cumberbatch performed greatly in the role of Alan Turing.I might confront this movie's magnitude with 'The king's speech'. It's so similar in themes that it almost feels a sequel to said movie. To sum up, The Imitation Game isn't a really bad movie, but not a so-excellent movie. It's averagely good.",8,0,0,29 December 2015
The Dark Knight," Not exactly what I was expecting
","I find it very strange to understand why is this the most loved movie of the dark knight trilogy. I find it even stranger that many fans of this movie seem to forget Batman Begins, or don't know that there is a previous chapter.Don't get me wrong, I liked it after all. My first complaint must be with the beginning. For the first I dunno, maybe 20 minutes, I couldn't recognize that I'm watching the sequel to Batman Begins. Gotham City is just completely changed, in what is supposingly a year after batman begins. The fact that Rachel's actress has changed messes up things as well. Yeah, we meet known faces, such as Gordon, and *SPOILERS*. But the atmosphere is completely changed, even the batcave isn't a batcave (I don't feel that this is too spoilery...) Added to this there is a wuite fast-paced change of scenes from place to place, which gives you no time to get used to this new atmosphere.Things get better from batman's first extended action. from there on I can again find myself in the original world. Hey, don't get me wrong, I didn't came for this movie just for some action, just thinking about a point that makes you get in the movie I would say from that point. From that point on, damn it is enjoyable, and interesting.Definitely acting worked well in this movie. Heath Ledger performed as a great Joker, and all the others were just perfect in their roles.I found it interesting to find at least two 'accumulation' scenes that Nolan usually does: I am referring to scenes where you see seemingly unrelated stuff happening in fast shots, with tension music or a voice-over, and end in a suddent twist, such as an explosion. These kind of scenes appear in quite a few Nolan films, naming one: Interstellar.Another thing that I couldn't like much was this particular movie's scoring by Zimmer. It didn't feel at all that great as the others were.Still, this seems quite unrelated to Bruce Wayne / Batman's journey through the Dark Knight Trilogy, and being a good movie I didn't felt about it being the 4th best in the world or the best in the trilogy.",10,0,0,13 July 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," OK, almost...
","I must say, at first I hated this movie. I didn't understand anything about the end. Then I started seeing it again, and read the book, and finally understood this whole thing.I must say, now that I understand it, it's not a complicated movie. also, it definitely has great effects for 1968. What Tarkoskij said, and I agree with, this movie is a little 'cold'. In the final sequence, I don't feel that much of an emotional journey together with the main carachter, like in other films, e.g. Solaris, Stalker or even Interstellar, inspired by this film. Also there is a loong sequence at half movie that just makes me bored, for some odd reason.What I instead like of this, is the plot, and the cinematic side of it, the solutions adopted to film some scenes. The great synchronism between music and picture, the use of classical music, mixed with gyorgy ligeti's music really makes that side of the thing. Pink Floyd fans like me will like the fact that their song 'echoes' is perfectly synchronized with the last chapter of the movie, I suggest also to watch that listening simultaneously to the song, it definitely gives a different feeling.",10,2,4,2 December 2014
Avatar," Great visuals, partly obvious message, still an enjoyable film
","While Avatar maybe doesn't deserve to be the film with biggest box-office record, it's not so much of a 'bad story, eye candy' film as it is made believed in other reviews. Avatar was truly a breakthrough in filmmaking almost comparable to what Star Wars did in 1977, from the visual effects aspect of filmmaking. The motion-capture technology and advanced rendering sistem was nearly invented with this film, and is now commonly used in many films. And this movie is one of the few ones that has no CGI flaw in nearly 3 hours almost entirely shot in CGI, which is quite outstanding. We're introduced to a visually appealing world, really wonderful and also realistic (thanks to the mentioned advanced visuals). The opposite military-sci-fi technology of men makes the whole film unique. Story wise, it almost seems a natives vs white explorers story, just with aliens versus humans, and some misticism of different sorts. The existence of the dragon-like creatures makes the whole thing get a fantasy touch too. Plus we have some good old sci-fi, with the concept of Avatars. Really, this movie has a quite unique merging of different concepts. Casting worked perfectly to me, and so did direction. The ambientalist/freedom message is though kinda obvious, but it's also not as important as it might seem in order to enjoy the film. I really enjoyed the depiction of battles as well. Overall, an at least once must see film.",10,2,5,4 December 2014
Super 8," My rating would be 8 if haters hadn't over low rated this
","I said it in the title.Looking around on the reviews I've found both too pleasing and too negative reviews. Still I think it's more good than bad.One thing to underline is the teens's behaviour. Many people say that's annoying, stupid, and unreal, but having been at that age not too time ago I can see that's exactly how teen kids behave. So that argument is invalid.Then we have hates towards the 'too over dramatized' train crash, saying how impossible that scene is. My answer is: you came to watch a science fiction thriller about an alien on earth, and you expect realism? Must say that J.J. Abrams did a great job on this, and showed that he's able to direct a movie in Spielberg's style, so much that a friend of mine thought it's directed by Spielberg. I wasn't very okay with the ending, but overall this movie is enough good.",8,0,3,26 April 2015
The Da Vinci Code," How is this NOT faithful to the book?
","That's what reviwers say around IMDb. Let me say it: I started once watching it but got interrupted, I've read half of the book and then saw it all 'till the end.When I read the book, at least for the part until which I arrived at watching the film for the first time, we have a congruency of the two at 99%. Then, the part until which I arrived at reading in the book (we're talking about 6 hours of reading), so like the second 3rd of the movie, again 99%. When I've finished watching the movie I've read through the next part and found again the same level of congruency. Therefore I think many reviewers here tend to over-react at details, and to judge a movie based off a book without any exception.But, in films based off movies, when you see eragon, and compare it to, let's say, lord of the rings, you realise there are both good and bad transpositions. This is a case of a good transposition to films, with the important things nailed right, and the mistakes being only some minor details.One pro is the casting. While maybe for Robert Langdon they might've needed something else, yet Tom Hanks portrays enough well the character. Ian McKellen was a wonderful surprise to find too, he did maybe one of the best performances in the film, together with Paul Bettany as Silas, and Jean Reno as Fache. I feel to highlight these three between the stars that appeared in the film especially. But overall, by reading the book I can say that choices of actors seems perfect.I want to understand also why people found it boring. because they knew its ending, maybe? Definitely The Da Vinci Code is a fast-paced film, and in the moments of pause it's filled with interesting explanations that keep your attention. Finally, Hans Zimmer's score as usually is very fitting for the entire movie.What to me is partly a con is the repetitive shoeing of the cilice's bloody wound, a disturbing thing, that wasn't particularly shown this frequently in the book.Other than this, any cons the movie could have are cons that the book could have.",9,0,0,27 September 2015
Thor," Deserves a little more consideration
","As I said in the title, this movie is low-considered. Might be because of the not-so vast place it is located (A small New Mexico village). First of all, this might be the movie from Marvel avengers universe with better development of the main character. Also gives the origins to a main villain in the marvel cinematic universe, Loki, in a very smart way that might not everyone noticed. Also the score is very good, gives to Thor and his father Odin a Jesus and God-like looking. Also I want to remind the presence of Natalie Portman. One really annoying thing I homever seen is the overuse of slightly oblique shot. In the end, still this movie deserves more consideration. not the best, but not at all that bad as they tell it to be.",6,0,1,24 March 2015
War of the Worlds," The most accurate depiction of panic
","The first time I've seen this film I was around 11, and remembered only that it was very dark, but also not that good. Th usual internet opinion also influenced me on my position as for this film. Nonetheless, this film is often displayed as proof that Spielberg is a not-so- great director, as nit all of his films are masterpieces. By rewatching it, I realised actually how good is this film, and how Spielberg is a great filmmaker afterall.Let's start with the technical side, which was the first to blow me off. CGI aside, which, well, qualified for a 2005 standard, I didn't notice how well was the photography handled. There's tons of wonderful single takes (3 minutes of 360 rotations around the van, while seeing three characters talk and interact in the van while it is running! And it's not Emmanuel Lubetzki!) astounding camera angles and shots. The sound effect was appealing as well. I completely enjoyed listening to the sound of the tripods! Aside from the obvious need for CGI as for depicting the tripods and other vehicles, tons of practical sets were built. Towards the end, an entire field with houses and damaged cars covered with the red plants.What also got me was how accurately panic was depicted in this film. Take any Roland Emmerich disaster movie. You often see the mass of terrified people running here and there, but you could not convey the feel of anxiety these people had. In this film, Mostly in the middle part, there is one particular scene that shows how a crowd of desperate people act. I didn't ever see that in any disaster film the way you can see it here. Spielberg also lives up to his fame as 'master of suspense'. The third act mainly focuses on a couple of pretty intense scenes full of suspense.Most of what is criticised in War of the worlds is story aspects. There are some minor plot holes (first they show you now tech works, moments later people have cameras working), like in every movie, but I think the haters for this movies simply started to point out every single one of them. As if Apocalypse Now had no flaws (I recall that a site collecting every kind of errors made in movies has something like 532 errors listed for Apocalypse Now, despite its quality as a film). Even Inception has a small plot hole. Let me get this straight: this isn't Spieblerg's masterpiece, or isn't one of his masterpieces, but isn't a terrible film either.The story follows quite closely the original War of the World novel by H.G. Wells. The ending is the same, in every aspect, even the most criticised deus ex machina or the outcome for the main characters. There are subtle differences, as for example in the Novel it is a single character to travel, and not a divorced father with his daughter and his son, or the setting being the US, and not London, as the original setting was, or Tim Robbins' character having some slight differences. The red plants appear also in the novel. There are some plot differences, as H.G. Wells' novel was set in the 1900s.The problem is, that Close Encounters of the Third Kind showed us friendly aliens. When I was around 8. it was due to all those 'alien invasion' sci fi stories that I started being constantly afraid of aliens, and my parents made me watch E.T. for that reason. Spielberg's precious works made us pretty much delete our image of aliens being hostile and believable at the same time. I think this is the main reason for War of the Worlds' negative reception. I suggest watching this film, especially if you enjoyed Minority Report. J.J. Abrams' visual style comes mainly from this film and from Minority Report, on the other hand.",8,2,4,17 August 2017
Joker," A psychological study, rather than a superhero flick
","I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.",10,1635,2186,1 September 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Live. die. watch again.
","This was a movie I was waiting for ever since I got to know about it being produced.I liked this, it's not as breathtaking as Inception, but definitely a good and entertaining movie. Something I want to underline that this is a military sci-fi, that means a lot of bad words, I wasn't expecting that, but Thinking of it in a military ambient that's kinda normal. Much of the technology we see here for some reason reminds me of Avatar.The story was great, I for some reason was expecting more, but it was definitely well written, If we take out some leaks in its structure, that are quite normal if we are watching a such paradoxical movie.Obviously effects have a big role here, still not the main reason of the movie. Now watching again I noticed gory details I haven't before, not like i'm enthusiastic of that at all.Music was right to this movie, Ironically you don't hear that song from the trailer, but is not the best soundtrack i've heard.Overall this is a good, entertaining movie for people who like paradox-things, or war-centered films. Or just see something sci-fi as me ;)",8,0,3,9 December 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," An acceptable ending (minimal spoilers)
","The battle of the five armies suffers the lack of stuff remaining to tell. As I said, including the whole encounter with smaug in this movie would have been better for this movie. Again, I'm considering the extended edition of the film.While saying that it's the worst in the middle-earth film saga might make this sound a bad movie, it isn't. It's an enjoyable movie, manages to keep you excited at watching an almost 2 hours long battle (the remaining 40 minutes are the set-up and the ending).What I noticed is that the extended edition makes two things with the movie: adds some much more gory scenes (really pulpy ones), which I particularly don't like, but also makes you care more about many of the 13 dwarfs. What some people always complained about is that you can't know and love all the 14 main characters of the hobbit trilogy the way you loved the members of the fellowship of the ring. There are various additional scenes that feature some of the dwarfs (including my favourite, the largest dwarf Bombur), some scenes make understand the outcome of the hobbit trilogy better, and so on. The complaint that I heard about the hobbit trilogy being not emotional is nonsense. In this movie I saw many of my family members cry being touched by the ending. Now ultimately, the finale of the film is again, just as with the desolation of smaug, the reason I didn't give a further high mark. The last scene just doesn't make feel as conclusive as, for instance, the ending of return of the king did. I do understand that it's only the last few minutes of the film that I'm considering, but those weren't conclusive. What gave a bigger feeling of conclusion was the sing in the ending credits instead.",8,0,2,30 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Maybe my favourite of the saga?
","Last movie produced in the saga, maybe it's the best! Great Effects, dramticity of the characters and the events, this is the most tragic episode of the saga.I heard from haters complains about Grievous, being him a wrong character from the point of view of the saga (using jedi weapons without having the force), but if you dig further in his past, everything is explained. That is another dramatic character like Vader, not as complex, but similar. Plot takes you in, some things may be frightening for younger viewers. This movie is plenty of action, some people also complain about having multiple lightsaber duels. There is a reason for that. This is the only movie that opens with a war in its full point. It actually is a war until the very end. Obviously don't expect jedis and sith to not take part of it. Really good directing of Lucas. giving this a 10/10",10,1,4,22 September 2014
Inception," A dream movie
","This is one of the best Nolan movies, i personally consider Interstellar the best, yet this one is very good too. The whole movie is well balanced between action and storyline, has a very smart plot, is both terrifying, well ending but also dramatic.Just as in the dark knight trilogy, Hans Zimmer is composing the music again, and must say it's maybe one of the best scores i've heard so far from him in Nolan movies.I'd like to underline also the special effects, this has almost 90% non-CG effects, and has some brilliant solutions to depict certain unusual phenomenas.Let me also say that this movie is in no way a 'matrix rip-off' It literally has nothing to do with that other movie.Overall, I consider this a must-see movie.",10,1,3,21 November 2014
Murder on the Orient Express," A single mistake
","I was quite saddened when I walked out of the cinema: it was very hard for me to accept that, while the film was nearly perfect in almost all technical aspects, a film that you could feel that those involved took their effort in making it as perfect as they could, it failed at one of the most important: its pacing.Let's immediately start with this issue the film had, which ultimately resulted in the rating I chose to gave it. The problem was that, particularly the whole murder solving part of the film, felt almost rushed, too quick. It all felt too obvious, almost too simple in deduction, as if anyone could have solved the case (and I, not having read the book or seen the previous film, did solve it a bit earlier than the revelation scene, due to the way clues where showed). My assumption is that producers allowed only a short lenght to the film, for commercial purposes, which lead to heavy cuts on that part of the film. I personally think that it would have been wiser to cut some of the scenes from the first third of the film: it takes about 10-15 minutes for the viewer to finally be aboard the Orient Express. Those 15 minutes, which did introduce Poirot and the other characters, could have been shortened or even cut altogether, in my opinion, even though they where fun, as they didn't focus on the main story. With a better pacing, the film could have decisively been saved.Another thing I didn't enjoy was the score: it felt too lightening, especially in the revelation scene, when it should have been much darker, and it being too lightening in that scene ruined most of the moral ambiguity that the finale required.Despite these two aspects, Murder had outstanding photography (I particularly liked the final shot), the settings (The choice of not displaying the revelation scene inside the dining hall, as, it is my understanding, Lumet's version did, but a much more scenographic setting), and notable is Branagh's impersonation and acting of Poirot, did with great cure, and which I particularly liked.Ultimately, I do consider worth my ticket, although not at the levels of satisfaction I hoped. I hope that, for the planned sequel, Branagh will reprise at least the role of Poirot.",7,0,2,9 December 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," the unexpected quality of birdman
","Let me start by saying that I was angry at birdman winning Oscars in its year, especially because I wanted so badly for Nolan's Interstellar to win it. But, afterall, I decided to watch it because The Revenant bugs me, a film from the same director. First of all, the way it was shot, to make it look an entire two-hours long scene was well done. The director whom name I still haven't learned deserved the Oscar entirely. The whole thing was enough interesting to keep me interested for the movie's full lenght. The ending was cryptic enough to make you think about the meaning for quite some time. That's something I like in a movie. Also, very creative soundtrack, made almost entirely with percussion instruments. What instead made me strike one mark off is language. There was so much vulgarity It, for once, disturbed me. After watching birdman, I ask myself, why all that hate? Because it criticises almost everything. Movie-making (Though Oscar electors liked that), Actors, stage theater, superheroes, journalists, common people and so on, by showing all the stupidities of the world of nowadays.I strongly believe though that rating a movie like this with a rating lower than 6 is very wrong. Even if offensive, it deserves at least consideration for the direction and acting.",10,2,6,8 January 2016
Back to the Future Part II," Best sci-fi comedy series ever
","You can't review each movie alone, the trilogy is so bond together that it's impossible.Must say that this is one of the most memorable Sci-fi comedies or movies related to time- travel in the whole film making history. The story's great, you'll love the plot. Dr. Brown's explanations make sure that even the most complex things could be understood by everyone. You'll get excited for all the high-tense scenes like never, even after seeing it several times. That's one of the best things about the movie. Alan Silvestri's score is just great, gives an emotional touch like not many scores do.Now, a little problem comes to the fx. instead of using models like in star wars (what also made star wars win Oscars for the effects) they started using CG, just CG technology wasn't yet so perfectioned in 80s-90s like nowadays. That's a little problem though, the movie's not overloaded with these FX at all. Of course you will laugh at the depiction of 2015 in the second chapter.",9,3,4,3 December 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," If you think of this as a trilogy conclusion, it's not bad at all.
","I think this movie deserves the fanbase the dark knight (previous chapter) has. Still there's quite some hate for this, which can be explained by one thing: its bondage with Batman Begins. you can seriously skip the dark knight and get to this without the need of explaining anything. The movie explains what happened in the dark knight.There's quite a lot of symbolism and important stuff in this story that many ones forget about or didn't like here, such as (MILD SPOILERS START) the prison pit being a bigger version of the pit from Batman Begins One thing that I particularly liked in the story was Bane's picture you discover at the end, which actually makes you have a pity for him. Together with the final plot twist that most of Nolan films have (and haters of the movie hated), it gives a very real character, which was greatly performed by Tom Hardy. The story introduces another character that becomes of some relevance: John Blake. It seems to some people a useless character which would have been well replaced by a more extended gordon's appearance, but they seem to forget the relevance his character has in literally the last shot of the film. Catwoman's character, as depicted in the movie, might not be a photocopy of the DC character, which is not a problem for me and anyone else that isn't a die-hard comic book fan, but gives her a such behaviour that truly resembles catwoman. Finally, there's a huge problem that people have with Batman's limited screen time. In my belief, a movie should not be judged by the amount of screen time of the alias of the main character. (MILD SPOILERS END)The last thing to praise is definitely the amazing Zimmer score.",10,1,4,13 July 2015
Blade Runner," Wasn't expecting it to be like this
","When I got to know of the blade runner's existence I made up in my mind an image of it being just some science fiction flick with gore and 80s music. THerefore, when I got to see it, I was... it's undescribable. I've seen other ridley scott films, the gladiator and Robin hood, but I would almost say that those films have been directed by a different person. The overall story of the film is quite simple, what makes the movie become a masterpiece is the way it is developed. Being a Christopher Nolan fan myself, I can say that I can see how Nolan's cinematography is influenced by this particular film. Other than visuals, and the way the story is shown, also the score fitted perfectly. Some sort of progressive rock merged into a filmscore, with powerful electric sounds that fitted perfectly the cyberpunk atmosphere. As for the gore in the film, I myself checked what does it consist of in the IMDb parents' guide. Literally, the way it's described makes it seem more gory than what it is. And as I was one of those people that turned around into certain scenes of the lord pf the rings, you can judge wheter you can handle it or not. Luckily enough, the fact that there are many different cuts of the film allows to choose the Director's cut version, which contains none of said gore, even though apparently the Final Cut of the movie is what Ridley Scott feels closer to his vision of the film.",10,0,2,27 August 2015
Ben-Hur," One of the best movies of the time
","Ben Hur was the first pre '60s movie I seriously saw. And it was just as exciting as watching a newer film.Despite it's a rather old movie, so there aren't the effects of nowadays, and it is also really long, it just keeps you attached until the really end. Much like the count of montecristo, Ben has quite a few adventures and takes his revenge. Story-wise, Ben Hur is also partly a religious film. In the background there's always Jesus, who lived in the period.I won't hold you any longer. It might be a little outdated, but Ben Hur is a movie I preferred seeing waaay more than seeing Gone with the wind (You can check my review).",8,0,2,7 January 2016
Thor: The Dark World," Not that bad...
","This is again like the previous chapter too downrated. Want to remind that more than a superhero movie, The dark world seems a space-fantasy movie. This movie has much action, though I somehow managed to get bored at the end. The fact is that, just as Guardians of the galaxy, marvel space sci-fi overuses energy flares, beams and such... and that at the very end gets kinda annoying to me. Still, Thor: the dark world has enough humor, story, and good plot/action to overlook at this slight problem... I want to note down that toward the beginning we have a series of events that reminds deeply of the phenomenas described in the novel 'Roadside picnic' of the strugackij brothers, the original story that inspired Tarkovskij's eternal sci-fi classic, Stalker; therefore I really appreciated that maybe unwanted reference. Score is different than the first one, and I didn't like it that much. Overall, I liked the movie, not so much like other stuff, this is not at all a deep science fiction.",5,0,1,24 March 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Afterall this is my favourite star wars movie so far
","I just got home from seeing it. Definitely was a great movie, a great star wars movie. First thing I want to outline, which is not really spoilerific, that there were a few things from the trailers that did not make it to the final cut. Although J.J.'s lens flares did appear (obviously) quite a lot of times, the first thing to praise is the visuals, especially the intro's visual. Also later on, all the various settings were well cured. Surely the force was strong with the direction of this film. Next on, acting of the actors. That was great. Everyone just did the best he/she could, which was fantastic. Now the most important thing in a star wars movie, besides having stunning visual effects (Wich were just really the best in this film) is the story. Many ones hated the prequels for that, and praised the originals for having great stories. Episode VII has definitely both the best story and plot and the best backstory. The 30 years of period after VI got well covered, episode VII has a lot of great elements which expanded the galaxy really well. Definitely old EU fans will see a lot of new things they won't dislike. What homever bothers and bothered me was the music. It's john williams, you can hear it, but sound more like Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull's and harry potter's score. That's strange to be seen on a star wars film. So... overall this was a great film that earns my respect. J.J. Abrams won't be called Jar Jar Abrams",10,9,37,16 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best Middle-Earth saga movie (Very little spoilers)
","The Return of the King stands as one of the best LOTR, Tolkien-based and fantasy movies of all time. First of all, it's the only LOTR movie that doesn't feel too long even in its extended edition. It keeps you excited literally for all the 4 hours of lenght of the film. I think having an extended edition of return of the king is partly compulsory, because it has added some scenes that are important for the continuity of the whole story (E.g.: Saruman's fate). Secondly, I felt that CG was very much improved since the previous film. Here, CG creatures felt much more real than in 'The Two Towers'.Overall, this movie certainly deserves being one of the films with most Oscars ever, it just deserved all of them!",10,2,3,7 January 2016
The Truman Show," Comedic serious film
","The Truman Show is a very interesting film. Most of you'll know the plot well, so I won't stop summing it up. The story is not too complicated, funny and yet with some melodramatic sadness. This strange melanchony is carried on through the entire film.Visual effects aren't really memorable, but the entire film's concept makes the thing outstand. Jim Carrey's performance adds to whatever's left out of the film, Ed Harris delivers nicely his character too. Next to that, homever, the ending didn't feel completely satisfying, and the music was not memorable at all.There's not too much to tell. Go watch this film and you'll understand the feeling it gives.",8,0,0,26 April 2016
Godzilla," Not as bad as other users say
","I am costricted by other users' too low rating to give this a 10/10 to attempt balancing the rating.Now, this is not a movie that is mainly about two hours of godzilla walking around a city and smashing all. We have that too, but in a brief way, making it not the main part of the film.The film's first part is a slower, more thriller-like part, with some clear references to Tarkoskij's 'stalker' that I've personally spotted, but that still drives some plot in it. The second part of the movie is the one that includes the most action and catastrophic-apoc. scenes, and I'd like to underline the use of a track composed by Gyorgy Ligeti, used also in 2001: a space odissey to give the right atmosphere to a scene that I'd define iconic to this movie.Complains about this movie come from the real pro of the movie, the existence of a not- too plain plot, and the short amount of screen time Godzilla has, choice done by Edwards maybe because this is somehow just an 'introduction' movie, all reasons that make this a 'not-just-action' movie, and reasons I actually liked it. Also the subplot of the characters involved gives a more real-like feature to the whole movie.Nonetheless, as I said I wouldn't truly rate this 10/10, but more a 8/10, because it still doesn't have a so-complex plot, but I wouldn't blame writers or the director for that, they already tried to do the most possible, but more likely the carachter itself's plainess... let's admit, Godzilla couldn't have a very complicated plot anyhow.Still I liked this movie and suggest everyone to see it.",8,9,14,21 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Masterpiece of modern science fiction
","First I'd like to state that this is my first review, and to apologize whenever it has some mistakes.Star Wars is considered, as written in the title, 'Masterpiece of modern sci-fi'. That's true; This movie is a division point between the Kubrick/Tarkovsky - like philosophical sci-fi, and the Cameron/ Scott - like action sci-fi. Many people consider it bad, because it's old and they say 'looks fake'. Now, I want to state that, yes indeed it doesn't have so advanced effects as the movies nowadays made, but confronting with both contemporary and latter sci-fi works, it's got outstanding effects (e.g. it won the Oscar for that). Don't want to spoil the story, will just say that it's what could make this movie a Fantasy- story in a science fictional setting.There are two editions traveling around the world: an upgraded with CG effects (Though many people say these add-ons are invasive I disagree) and an original edition from 1977. No complains for any of those.",10,1,3,22 September 2014
Annihilation," An 'intellectual' sci-fi horror
","This film isn't at all a light one to watch. Very tense, at some point genuinely terrifying, devoid of an immediate explanation for most of the story elements, and deep in meaning, it is a fairly good science fiction (maybe even horror) film.The plot centers around a scientific expedition in Area X, a region where laws of nature apparently don't apply and supernatural events happen. Something I really like about this film is the semi-absence of expositional dialogue. Most of the information is implied or provided visually, and the amount of dialogue is reduced to the minimum. I consider this to be a positive thing in a visual medium like film.Alex Garland's previous film had an overall gloom tone and tackled with deep themes. This film does the same, but at a magnified grade: towards the second half of the film, the flick provides a huge rate of anxiety to the viewer, while it focuses mainly on psychological themes, such as self-destructing tendencies and depression (hence the title). Visually, Annihilation is wonderful to watch, end credits included. It has a distinct visual style, which makes it very appealing, and a tendency to blend in well practical and computer-generated effects. The all-female lead cast seemed to me all right. I wouldn't say it was a particularly challenging film to act in, which also means there weren't any relevant performances, but I can say that the actors where rightfully cast for their roles.When I first heard about this film, I immediately thought of it as a 'Stalker' rip-off. It has numerous similarities to both the 1979 film by Tarkovskij and the book that inspired the soviet film ('Roadside Picnic'). It still sounds to me very odd that the author of the Southern Reach Trilogy (from which this film was adapted), as he claims, invented by himself such a similar premise and story for his books without knowing about 'Roadside Picnic' or 'Stalker'. I won't get into details, but there are numerous, starting from the features of Area X (the 'Zone' in the russian novel and film), the supernatural events that occur in the place, the institution studying the phenomena and so on.Annihilation is a stunning and meaningful film, and so far one of the best ones of the year. Definitely it's a memorable netflix original, even though, in my personal opinion, it isn't as thematically deep as its soviet counterpart was.",8,2,5,25 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Sequel to the masterpiece is masterpiece
","Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is one of the best films ever, and is considered by readers of empire magazine THE best movie ever.This is probably one of the most dramatic parts of the saga. Just as said for episode IV, voices that in the original trilogy visual effects look fake aren't right. Everything looks real and most of all Master Yoda, Cloud City do.This movie is not directed by George Lucas but instead by Irvin Keshner. I'd like to remember that much of the story-setting, the properties of the Force (I won't say what's that, you'll find it out alone) is decided in this movie. I gave a 10/10",10,1,2,22 September 2014
Moon," Might be one of the best exording-direction movies
","I just cannot not give this a 10/10 rating.This Science Fiction goes in the 'slow/Philosophical' category, and is really one of the best in that category as well.Story is well made, has just a few, minor leaks, but the whole atmosphere touches you in a way I wasn't expecting. This atmosphere is to be thanked to Sam Rockwell, the well- designed base, kevin spacey and the great direction, not forgetting the music. I don't even remember the composer's name, but despite some strange tunes, it's definitely the best movie for this atmosphere; when you get to know that this movie has been written by Duncan Jones only because he wanted to collaborate with sam rockwell at all costs, you see how great-talented this director seems until now.Slowness could be an issue to many, but I strongly think that this movie gives it all anyways. Also the last minutes drive together a bunch of coincidences that make feel excited even if you know exactly what happens next, and that's something to keep in mind.",10,1,4,4 December 2014
Back to the Future," best sci-fi comedy
","You can't review each movie alone, the trilogy is so bond together that it's impossible.Must say that this is one of the most memorable Sci-fi comedies or movies related to time- travel in the whole film making history. The story's great, you'll love the plot. Dr. Brown's explanations make sure that even the most complex things could be understood by everyone. You'll get excited for all the high-tense scenes like never, even after seeing it several times. That's one of the best things about the movie. Alan Silvestri's score is just great, gives an emotional touch like not many scores do.Now, a little problem comes to the fx. instead of using models like in star wars (what also made star wars win Oscars for the effects) they started using CG, just CG technology wasn't yet so perfectioned in 80s-90s like nowadays. That's a little problem though, the movie's not overloaded with these FX at all.",9,6,7,3 December 2014
The Bourne Supremacy," Yeah!
","this is a great follow-up, though not my favourite in the trilogy.the 'shaky camera' effect might have been a little overused, but still not disturbing to me. Follows pretty well the previous entry. Must say that from here on I also prefer Matt Damon's acting.We have here too plenty of action sequences that are quite exciting, and the same music as in the previous episode, but maybe not that disturbing.Also we must say that there is relatively a small amount of blood and gore, which is good for people sensitive to that.Overall, go, watch it, possibly after seeing The Bourne Identity. it's worth.",9,3,3,26 April 2015
Alien: Covenant," There's more than what emerges on the surface
","Alien: Covenant suffers from the ambiguous legacy left behind by Prometheus. Whereas the internet opinion discarded Prometheus and its lack of xenomorphs, Covenant minimised the bonds with its previous chapter in favor of more connections with the original Alien film from 1979. This lead to further shared and undeserved criticism: while Prometheus was too far from Alien, Covenant apparently is too close to it, and lacks of explanations as for some crucial questions raised in Prometheus.My personal view is in favor of both this movie and Prometheus. Covenant brought new cards to the table, despite what the common belief is.Let's talk about the connections with Prometheus first. There is not much explanation given about the big question from Prometheus, which was the reason that led the Engineers to decide to destroy mankind. At least not openly. I realised after some thoughts that many of those questions people want an answer to were indirectly answered through some small hints. As for quality, I personally think both Covenant and Prometheus are pretty much on the same level, with maybe Covenant being slightly more appreciated by me personally. David, the android from Prometheus, as we already knew, is back. His character has been further developed (partly at the expense of the new Fassbender character, Walter) and deepened. A theme that was developed in Covenant is that of creation and creationism. The film finally explores an interesting concept not very developed in previous alien films: just like the Engineers would be the creators of humans, humans created androids. This concpet will be further developed through the origins of the Xenomorphs.The origins of Xenomoprhs are finally unveiled, and the truth is much different from what one might have thought. While Xenomorphs appear for about 20 minutes of the film, there is much insight given to their genesis, something that I didn't expect. There are numerous subtle connections with Alien and even with Aliens, starting from the aliens text at the beginning, which in this film is identical to the 1979 film (underlining how Covenant is closer to Alien than to Prometheus). What I further enjoyed in the film was the very classical sci-fi tone of the first half hour. Many scenes in that portion of the movie had a strong 2001 vibe to them, with the effects and photography of a modern film. The movie then moved to a more modern approach, all the way to the ending. The horror side of Covenant wasn't as frightening as the original film. In defense for the film, when they reach the 6th film featuring a Xenomorph, it is quite hard to bring some. fresh frightening concepts, hence I personally won't complain about that. This is so far also the most bloody film in the franchise, and that is certain. The crew of the USCSS Covenant was far more enjoyable than that of the Prometheus, especially in the characters of Daniels, Walter and Tennessee. They're not Ripley, but they were enough unarrogant so to allow me to root for them (unlike most of the Prometheus crew members, except for the three pilots, Shaw and David). The outcome of the film is, obviously open, so to leave space for a third film, which can bring some final answers to some questions raised. Despite that, I think the two hours I spent watching Alien: Civenant were definitely well payed back.",9,122,238,16 May 2017
The Martian," The ultimate astronaut film, and the best film set on mars
","The martian kind of feels like the third chapter in a trilogy together with Gravity and Interstellar. While the three movies are quite different, they all feel very close to each other. I absolutely enjoyed both the others, and this was no exception. With no action, and much science, it was enoyable despite its 2h20m lenght, which to some people is already a huge lenght. Wonderful visual depictions of Mars made it excel. Compared to 'Mission to Mars' and 'The Red Planet', the other two Mars films, it is just waaaaay more enjoyable (Even though I'll admit that I enjoyeb myself Mission to Mars). The cast choice seemed perfect, and next to it the great direction of Ridley Scott worked out. As 'The Martian' is also based on a novel, a compare to the novel is needed. They managed to show almost everything that happened in the novel, with the difference that in the novel Mark Watney would explain every single thing he did scientifically. Another thing that worked well was the music. It fitted in well. For the scientific aspect of the film, yes. They got everything right. That's been told unanimously by any phisician asked upon the film. Stop reading reviews, and go to watch The Martian to spend great 2hrs20mins",9,0,0,26 April 2016
Atonement," Not a romance, not a class-conflict film, not a war movie.
","if it wasn't for the upcoming Dunkirk movie by Christopher Nolan, and if I didn't come the single-take shot, I probably would never see this film. I've never been interested in Pride and Prejudice, Anna Karenina or so-to-say pink novels adapted in film at all, although I did come across 'The Soloist' by the same director, Joe Wright, which I liked but didn't have a lasting impact on me.It is difficult to review this particular title. It is absolutely not a war movie, at least in my view, the sheer lenght of the sentimental relationship between McAvoy and Knightley's character prevents it from being a romance, the specific premise to which things are set in motion doesn't let it being a class-conflict centered story, although subthemes constantly pop up. It is to note that the class-conflict aspect of the film is mostly very subtle, particularly in relation to how that event which acts as premise to the plot is being dealt with by the aristocratic family of Knightley's character. Certain aspects reminded me of stage drama tragedies. The title has much been criticized: how's the ending an Atonement at all? In my interpretation, it is a certain character's whole existence, with her being always thorn by the acts she did or omitted to do, that acts as a sort of 'atonement', an attempt to somehow even out things between her and the other characters' relationships.I would like to keep the plot as much as under wraps. I'd like to point out that, until the last 10 minutes, I kept trying to ignore as much as possible an aspect of the plot I found idiotic (why a certain character didn't simply just withdraw its statement?). It was those final minutes that provided an explanation which simply brought back things to be logical. That said, the film is clever. Constant time-jumps and very subtle implications suggest some of the smartest portions of the plot. Don't expect Nolan-leveled complexity though. Technically, again, the photography is outstanding, in nearly the entire film. Certainly, the peak is the 5+ minutes Dunkirk single take sequence, but really it is needless and too long to list every single outstanding shot the film had.2008 was a year packed with too many good films that prevented Atonement from winning more Oscars. That said, Atonement deserves the acclaim it receives.",10,0,0,12 July 2017
