Requiem for a Dream," What a wild ride!!!
","OK moviev fans. Those of you who are looking for an excellent movie for real entertainment then, this one is for you. If you are not into reality based movies then stay away from this one. My brother recommended this movie to me about a month ago.  To tell the truth I didn't remember this movie being advertised or any thing, thats quite a over sight on my part since I am a big movie buff.  This movie drew me in immediately with the camera shots- close ups and the camera movement- I was clinching my heart and teeth once the ride started. The complete drama and the images remained imprinted in my mind for several days after wattching this movie. The lives of the four characters become pure chaos from where they start. I can't find the words to describe what goes on--- you just have to see it!!!!!",Null,0,1,12 February 2002
Footloose," GARBAGE!
","Here is one of those idiotic far fetched plot lines that plagues us several times in a decade. A town passes ordinances to band hard rock music and dancing. Oh, come on!! Not just the plot but the characters are pitiful as well. Ren, what kind of name is that and oh, Sarah Jessica Parker, the only bright spot in this flick but what a far cry from what she looks like now- talk about and ugly duckling!!",1,5,18,14 February 2002
Flashdance," What the.....
","What the heck was this crap. Boy, this was a tasteless mindless work of garbage. It was very obvious that stunt doubles were dancing for the lead actor, especially when she tried to incorporate break dancing into her routine. What a lame movie. This reminds of other works of crap like 'Footloose' and 'Dirty Dancing'. I gave this movie a 1 for the lack of entertainment value. If you have not seen this movie, don't bother. If you see the video/dvd on the shelf, shoot it!",Null,2,5,31 August 2002
Dirty Dancing," CORNY
",What a sorry flick. Too awful and corny to finish watching. There is not too much to say about this one. The story is ridiculous. I don't know why this just didn't go straight to video. How this made it to the silver screen is beyond me. What a waste!.,1,7,24,14 February 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Great entertainment but lacks a little substance
",I loved everything about this sequel except the 'cause and effect' speech. I think the Wachowski brothers should have stuck to the story line more instead of jumping to action and fighting scene 1 after another. The fight scenes were great but seemed to have been ill planned. In the 1st Matrix the characters fought when they had to. With the exception of Neo- all other characters in the Matrix Reloaded should have tried to avoid confrontation with the agents leaving the element of a threat. The new agents did not seem as much of a threat this time. New characters like the twins were introduced but what the heck is their purpose and what are they? Other than that everything was ok- loved the rejoicing scene at Zion!,9,0,0,27 May 2003
