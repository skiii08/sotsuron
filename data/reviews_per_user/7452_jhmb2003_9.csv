United 93," The risks of telling the simple facts
","This astonishing movie has some very strong points I would like to address: We've got a problem. In September 11, 2001 America was the victim. In a strange, perverse way, the rest of the world began to suspect that America was the attacker. Most of the people in my country don't give a dime about the 'official' story. They think that all was set by the government or at least with the complicity of some politicians, including the President, George W. Bush.This movie is not a propaganda and that's why It could serve as a testimony in a better way than any other efforts, such as government press releases and fake documentaries: There are no superhero characters, terrorists are what they are, but not monsters, there are no 'patriotic' or didactic dialogs or actions, and, best of all, it didn't buy any of the conspiracy theories. Just the simple facts. The truth, sometimes, is very hard to believe in.",7,1,4,4 October 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Another childish flick
","This movie, as 99% of Hollywood's productions, was made for kids and teens, or people who think they are still kids. I don´t want to say it's bad or stupid, it's just...like a floppy, disposable, toy. As an adult, I felt a waste of time sitting down and trying to watch this kind of material, even with one of my kids besides me, enjoying it. Saying this, if you take this movie seriously you can point out the following: 1. It lacks of historical accuracy or even the remotest realism (pirates were bandits blessed by the Queen who used to attack Spanish vessels, I guess, or someone told me that). 2. All the characters are caricatures from a comic strip 3. The plot is 0, nil, nought, zero. 3. The formula: Maximum adventure with Minimum suspense (poor Hitch!) 5. Avalanche of FX to keep the children amused. 6. No dialogs, no conflicts, no real life. But, who wants these things today?",4,2,4,16 April 2004
Taxi Driver," seven axioms about Taxi Driver
","Taxi driver is masterpiece because: 1. You can watch this movie like if you were listening your favorite tune. Again and again and again... 2. Travis Bickle is truly one of the most weird and consistent characters made in history of cinema. 3. Robert De Niro reaches the perfect work. After this movie he began to repeat himself. And all the performances are brilliant. Every character is unforgettable. 4. The music is another high peak. If you don't like this movie, you can enjoy the music. 5. T.D. defeats its own faults. Example: It has an unnecessary and weak epilogue and it's still awesome. 6. Scorsese melted his own style and gave us a guideline to enjoy his next masterpieces. 7. The story has a remarkable moral: Sometimes, Hell's path is plenty of good will and Heaven's path is full of evil. Good and Evil at random.",10,0,0,2 July 2003
The Revenant," A sophisticated entertainment with a glimmer of poetry
","The Revenant is not a great movie, it is a solid, sophisticated entertainment, which sometimes achieves certain poetic intensity. But above all, it is a product made conscientiously to try and entertain big audiences, especially young people and adolescents. The plot, as known, is fairly linear and predictable, we do not care so much what will happen but how it will happen, and here the script writers have put their greatest efforts. The film is enhanced by multiple cinematographic, literary and historical references, although many of them may seem obvious to an experienced film viewer. The film succeeds at times to evoke the spirit of the novel Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy, because of its obsession with open spaces, exploring long distances and sometimes a true visionary power, trying to explore the American dream of racial domination and expansion under a standard of a relentless violence. Moreover, there are also references to other major films, such as Dersu Uzala, by Kurosawa, in a key scene in which the main character must share his helplessness with the Pawnee Indian. In my opinion, the movie reaches its splendor during this part. There are even references to ancient literary traditions, such as the Song of the Cid, an epic poem of the Spanish Middle Ages (a clue scene almost at the end of the movie). All told, the film, like all major Hollywood productions, suffers from gigantism, exaggerations and unnecessary cruelties of dramatic effects, and some implausibility. The characters still tend to be quite credible, but the superlative performances achieved disguise the little affection that writers have for their characters.",8,1,3,31 January 2016
Big Fish," Big Fish, small movie
","Watching a movie like 'Big Fish' I realized I am sick of 'fantasy'. I am sick and tired of watching so false and artificial stories. So overwhelmingly decorated that they seem birthday cakes: look good, taste bad. The minor lies beneath this movie are nothing in comparison with the major lies. Black doctors delivering white babies? Black kids in white churches? In the '40? In Alabama? These are just little examples of 'real fantasy', if you excuse the oxymoron. The political correctness is the main lie, by no means the only one: Britons speaking like southerners? 33 years old guys acting as teenagers? Etc. This fantasy, decorated with corny FXs and clichés, does not deserve its fame as a great movie. It's just a medium entertainment if you don't have anything else to do. Certainly, Tim Burton improved his performance in comparison with the abominable 'Planet of Apes' but he is still very far from his best shape ('Ed Wood', 'Batman', 'Sleepy Hollow'). 5/10.",5,4,9,12 May 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A remake of a non-existent movie
","I have seen this movie after a couple of years because I am not very fond of Jim Carrey's theater of faces; so I tried to avoid him as much as I can. Finally, I found a good actor doing his job. Unfortunately, I also found a flat, fake, boring movie. Despite all of the favorable criticism, to me 'Eternal..' is a corny love story decorated with pretentious elements, such as the editing. The director and writer have stolen son many little things of other great movies (particularily from Europe) that in America people could think this is an original stuff. That's understandable where even people who know about cinema do not know anything about movies from other countries. It's like a remake of a movie that has never been done. I am suspecting that audiences' memories are erased from time to time. This is the only way you think 'Eternal...' is original. Should I choose a similar movie, I prefer by far 'Total Recall' (Schwarzenegger - Verhoeven). This flick is pure joy, action and epic. America needs to find again it's own, strong voice again. Very fast.",2,5,12,5 November 2006
Don't Breathe," The real horror is here
","In this awfully dumb movie all of the rules of a good horror have been broken or ignored. As a result: 1) The thieves are involved in kind of competition of ineptitude and stupidity. 2) It's is impossible to feel any empathy with such morons. 3) The blind man is not only blind, but most of the time seems to be deaf, which is impressive, given his ability to defend himself. 4) The mix of natural and supernatural horror is appalling. 5) The dialogues may have been written by someone of the janitorial service who was hanging around there when the script was... I don't know what. 6) Everything happen at the wrong time in the wrong moment. 7) etc.",3,7,13,29 May 2017
The Matrix Reloaded," Matrix Side Story
","It works as a musical, but don't try so hard to understand what's going on. Doesn't matter. The story is so confusing and dazing that you may believe is deep and clever. Not at all. It's more like a palimpsest, where you can trace debris of movies such as Blade Runner, Fifth Element, West Side Story and, not too much, The Matrix. My best advise is: Enjoy choreography and music. 6/10",6,0,0,20 October 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," Not the best prison movie
","This movie is a mystery to me. I couldn't find anything exceptional on it. It's another HBO stuff, without any aesthetic achievement and It's absolutely conformist. But there is a fact: people love it. I want to be fair: the movie is OK, but people put it in the same place than The Godfather! Maybe I'm wrong, but it's not the best picture of all the times, not even the best prison picture of all the times. Now I'm remembering 'Cool Hand Luke' or 'American Me', they are stronger and wiser. But..people has the last word.",4,7,17,24 February 2003
