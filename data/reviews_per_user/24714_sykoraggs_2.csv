Scarface," Just Plain Overrated
","Thin plot.  Surprisingly good developement.  This is one of those movies about how a really selfish stupid guy (al pacino) used none of his wits or hard work to become very rich and powerful.  He was just a guy with way too many balls for anyone's own good.  You don't root for the bad guy, you don't root for the cops.  You just root for this really long and dull movie to end.",6,1,3,2 March 2002
The Iron Giant," One of the greatest American animated films ever
","i loved this movie.  great story.  great insight into humanity and characterizations.  great artistic style.  The only reason i gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because i honestly think that this film would have had a deeper meaning and more impact if the iron giant stayed dead in the end.  not that i hated his character, rather i think the giant was a great character.  the giant is actually one of the purest and most genuine of characters.  i wouldnt want him dead in real life, but hey this is a movie with deep overtones of social duty and tolerance (also a very fun and entertaining movie too!).  the giant's sacrifice has the potential to bring out the best in all of us, but his rebirth invalidates all that.  his rebirth just lowers the film back to the status of a simple kiddie flick where everything just ends up being good.",9,0,0,2 March 2002
