Vertigo," This movie is really great!
","This is one of my favorite movies, and imho the best movie Hitchcock made. The story is good, and Madeleine and Scottie make one of the most interesting couples of all time. Some might not like it, the movie got no flashy effects or loads of action, but either than that, its just too good to miss.",10,3,6,9 March 2003
American Beauty," Just a great movie!
","I like this movie for a lot of reasons, the great acting, the great directing, the great story, the great sub-text of that great story, the interesting main plot as well as the -did I say great yet- sub-plots. Also, the movie has a really surprising ending which turns just about everything around. And, after all, I like the message the movie provides. If you have not seen it yet, go watch it!",10,0,0,9 March 2003
