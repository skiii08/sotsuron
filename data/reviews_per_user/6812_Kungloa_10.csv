3:10 to Yuma," Redemption, at any cost.
","I think above all 'the Western' is the kind of movie genre that only interests its certain fans. Fans who love being told the oldest and most classic stories in a very straight-forward fashion.I would say this movie is kind of a break from that mold, the story doesn't settle with any subject matter nor are the characters set in a black/white world.Man is inherently good. This is something a lot of people believe in. Even if reality is more or less grounded in the grey area.Which is where most of these characters reside.Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) is a ruthless criminal, leader of an outfit of 'animals', loose but loyal henchman. It's quite the performance.Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is a rancher down on his luck, who seems to have found his redeeming act in bringing Ben Wade to justice. These two characters and at the same time the actors, make this film what it is. A story tracing the thin line between what is right and what is wrong. And with that knowledge, making a choice.",10,2,4,17 August 2010
Warrior," Devastating.
","This is a very emotionally driven movie, with pitch-perfect performances.Nolte is amazing and was frankly robbed at the Oscars. Hardy is brilliant and Edgerton successfully underplays his role.Along with 'the Fighter', the story is all about family and sticking together.MMA is the backdrop and provides a good setting for these three men to duke out their differences.This is a drama first, the spectacle is the powerful acting.And admittedly, it relies on many of the clich√©s of this particular genre but it remains gripping and true to itself, the story.Which could just as easily have been a true one. It probably is.10 out of 10.",10,1,4,8 May 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Amazing is correct.
","I literally just came back from seeing this and suffice it to say I enjoyed it immensely.OK, first of all, Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker is amazing. In my opinion he owns the role in the same way Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark and Christian Bale is Batman. And in terms of quality as far as reboots go this is up there with Batman Begins and Casino Royale.The pacing is methodical, a considerable amount of time (about the first half of the movie) is spent on character building and introducing us to the relationships and the people in Peter Parker's life. If you can stomach origin stories, you will love it.The story arc is bound to seem familiar but the focus of it is on Peter Parker, akin to Batman Begins for Bruce Wayne. It works wonderfully and makes for a much more emotional movie. Oh yes, if there is anything this particular Spidey has more than its predecessor, it's heart.A must-see for comic book fans,10/10",10,7,23,28 June 2012
No Country for Old Men," A Masterpiece Of Cinema.
","I would love to be able to successfully summarize this film into a review of a few paragraphs, but it is not possible to do so without underselling it.The synopsis in it's most simplistic form is that of a hunter stumbling upon some dead bodies, a stash of heroin and more than $2 million in cash near the Rio Grande. This is the most basic synopsis, but...No Country For Old Men undoubtedly offers much more food for thought than one can cram into a two-hour movie. There is a wisdom gazing around the entire time, a philosophy that will surely keep you pondering days after.I found myself amazed and dumbstruck at how The Coen brothers managed to maintain such a high level of intensity throughout the film, when sometimes so very little is going on.The acting is non-existent. Everyone finds his character. Their tasks are hardened ever more by the fact that they have such little dialog to play with.I loved the absence of dramatic music.I would recommend any fan of cinema to see this, but the fact is that it is not for everyone. Some may find the entire experience boring.While others like myself, will leave inspired.",10,1,3,10 August 2008
Batman Begins," Batman Reborn.
","I've waited a long time trying to find the right words to express my thoughts about this film. I have read some incredibly great reviews on this title that put it on a pedestal. But nothing compares to the movie itself. I'm not here to write a synopsis, but I will tell you this. The ending gives me goosebumps, every single time I see it.This is a story about self-discovery. About fear. And about justice. It is about man who struggles to deal with his anger and his guilt and who uses those feelings to fight those who harm the innocent.Nolan is a different kind of a film director in more ways than one, but when it comes to comic book adaptations he has changed the game.His vision here, inspired to bring together heavy talent for comic book movies instead of cheap B-list actors. His Batman is the reason we have Robert Downey Jr. in Iron Man and Edward Norton in The Incredible Hulk. I thank him for that. And everyone else who had a part in it.",10,1,3,16 July 2008
The Dark Knight," In Nolan I trusted...
","Unrelenting, unconventional, mordant and of course most of all, dark.The Dark Knight is one of the best movies ever made. Simply because it manages to merge multiple genres and succeeds at that. More than enough.The mere fact that this is being compared with movies such as the Godfather, Heat and The Departed means Nolan did something revolutionary not only to the Batman Franchise, but to the comic-book movie genre.Christian Bale plays such a heartfelt and humane Bruce Wayne. His Batman is the definitive one.Ledger's performance is one for the ages. His Joker is a good match for Bale's Batman and Nolan's vision.Aaron Eckhart delivers with what is perhaps his best performance yet. He was as much a part of this movie as Batman and The Joker.'Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded..' When you revolutionize a genre and with that cinema, a movie becomes a classic. This is a classic.Time will make that clear.",10,3,7,28 July 2008
Thor," The God Of Thunder.
","So I saw Thor yesterday. And I liked it, quite a bit. First things first, casting Anthony Hopkins as Odin was a stroke of genius. His voice alone could be considered his most powerful tool in his portrayal as the All-Father. His presence also instills a certain serious tone, which is just what this movie needed, it being about a comic-book superhero who happens to be based on the Norse God of thunder.Chris Hemsworth is another example of good casting.I've always preferred somewhat unknown actors in larger roles, it gives the actor the opportunity to boost his career and the director more creative freedom. Hemsworth does a marvelous job. Aside from his physique he carries himself with just the right amount of charm, pride and vigor to make Thor a lovable character.The action sequences are amazing and breathtaking to say the least. I can't even remember half of what happened during those scenes, I just remember that my popcorn was running really low really fast. It's certainly a feast for the eyes.Which brings us to the story. The story is quite straight-forward, aside from it happening in the realm of Asgard. An arrogant and young Thor is stripped of his powers by his father in order for him to learn the value of his life and life in general before he can take his father's place. There is more going on, but I would rather not spoil it.So in short, Thor is the perfect start for the summer season. A light fast-paced character-driven comic-book movie, upholding the old notion that we have to learn the lesson, of not knowing all the answers.",9,2,6,28 April 2011
X-Men: First Class," Definitely worth a watch.
","OK, so I've seen X-Men: First Class at least a couple of times now and suffice it to say it definitely holds up to repeat viewings. Let's start with the good.The casting is great, the two leads Erik Lehnsherr (Fassbender) and Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) have great chemistry between them and these are the most important roles in the movie, so you need strong actors for that.The entire plot revolves around the dynamic between these two characters and it's the better for it. Erik Lensherr comes from a troubled (German concentration camp) past which results in this sort of bottled rage which is his source of purpose in his older years.'My anger outweighs my guilt.' Heresy! How dare I use a quote from a Batman movie!But honestly, I think the same applies to Magneto with a big difference of course. He is blind to the fact that he is on the road to becoming what he hates the most. This difference in ideology between Erik and Charles is what causes the conflict between them.Fassbender certainly proves up to the task and I can honestly say I enjoyed his performance as Magneto more than Sir Ian Mckellan's.Without saying much, James McAvoy as (Professor) Charles Xavier is equally brilliant. He exudes a calmness and gives off the sense of a man wise beyond his years. I enjoyed his performance and it was also fun seeing X's younger years.The action/special effects are remarkable, which is to be expected from a (Marvel) comic-book movie. And I liked the music too, in particular, Magneto's theme.If I had one complaint it's the constant hammering of the idea of feeling out of place. I get why they do it, it just gets annoying after a while.All in all, if you're a fan of comic books (movies), you should make sure to see this.If you're not, it's still good entertainment.9 out of 10.",9,0,1,1 January 2012
50_50," 10/10.
","Everyone has their own ideas and notions about movies that tackle the subject of a person with a terminal illness, be it cancer or something else.Most of us tend to avoid them because they can often be too overly dramatic and depressing. 50/50 is a sure break from that mold.Now being called a cancer comedy, I have to say that term is quite appropriate. It's a really funny movie, which does not mean it won't make you cry. The driving force is the actor who plays Adam. (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)Adam is a 27 year old writer of radio programs and is diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer. This comes as a shock to Adam, (as it would to anyone) a mild-manner young man who in his own words, doesn't drink or smoke. The subsequent events follow him as he tries to gently break the news to his family and friends. Everyone reacts to it differently as people would in a true to life situation.Kyle (Seth Rogen) is appalled at first but proclaims that young people beat cancer all the time. This is a good role for Seth Rogen who usually only frequents raunchy comedies. Not to say he diverts from what is clearly his strong suit. It acts as comic relief here and it works as the part of Kyle is quite well-rounded.There is a specific reason for this.Adam is based on writer Will Reiser, who was diagnosed with cancer and later recovered. Reiser called Adam an extension of himself.Seth Rogen, who plays Kyle, helped Reiser cope with his disease and convinced him to write a screenplay during their early 20s together.Anjelica Huston who plays the role of Adam's mother (Diane) is magnificent. She reacts as any mother would in such a situation and the little scenes she shares with Adam are very earnest and emotional.You also have Anna Kendrick as the young and inexperienced therapist Katherine (who is a fictional character) and Bryce Dallas Howard as Rachael, the sometimes distant girlfriend. She is an amalgam of various different people in Will Reiser's life.I didn't think any of the actors did a bad job. Everyone was just right, with Joseph Gordon Levitt being the definition of nuance. Still considered a young actor by Hollywood standards, he has come a long way from TV shows and solely independent movies. If 50/50 is any indication, he should age like fine wine.This a great film. Chances are you'll find something of substance, a few life lessons in between the laughs in 50/50.",10,0,0,15 January 2012
Fast Five," Undeniably awesome.
","I dare anyone to name the 4th sequel of a franchise (not based on previously known material) that is actually considered a decent movie on it's own? That's right, if there are any, I doubt it's more than a handful.But to call this a decent movie is a gross understatement. If looked at for pure entertainment value, this is probably one of the best action movies I have seen in the last 5 years. You can call the whole thing over-the-top, I don't care, to be honest, that would also be an understatement.The thing is, every movie, even bad ones have a redeeming factor to them. Either it's a certain actor's performance, a unique story or brisk visuals. With this franchise it's always been about cars, babes and action. And it handles the action so exceedingly well this time around that you forget the cheesy moments, you forget you're at the movies, it's like you're right in the middle of it, from the very start.No doubt the cars are beautiful, the girls are gorgeous and the acting is exactly what you would expect. But the story actually has a subplot which gives the movie more emotional depth. Money and freedom is the motivator for these guys, but by doing what they do best they aren't just fighting for their own freedom. This is touched upon a couple of times and it gives the story a good moral boost.And if there isn't something being completely demolished on the big screen it's the trash-talking that keeps the pace at a high level. Laughter guaranteed.I can't recommend this movie enough for action junkies or people who just want to have a good time at the cinema. So if this hasn't been enough...Picture Ocean's Eleven, now think cars, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and a lot of eye-popping violence.Yeah that should do it.",8,0,1,8 May 2011
