The Monuments Men," Some confusion on the casting
","Back in the spring, I saw the film, then recently read the book, and went back to IMDb to figure out who played whom. I realized for the first time that they had changed the names of ALL the characters, including the very important ones. It is a shame that most viewers will not know the identity of the heroes (and heroine) that lived this historical drama. I realize that some individuals might have been morphed together into fictional ones to make the story more compact and coherent, and that some details were probably better left out, but to fictionalize people like George Stout, Walter Hancock and Rose Valland was a disservice to the story and the audience.",9,0,0,1 September 2014
