Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Ultimate finale to the ultimate revenge film.
","According to Uma Thurman, Tarantino had her watch three movies to prepare for this film: John Woo's 'The Killer,' Pam Grier in 'Coffy,' and Sergio Leone's 'A Fistful of Dollars.' If that sounds awesome to you, then the Kill Bill films are for you! Part two of what was originally planned as a 4-hour plus epic tale of revenge is even better than the first part. If Vol. 1 was primarily a homage to Asian genre cinema of the 60s and 70s, this installment is more a homage to westerns, particularly spaghetti westerns. Nods to others are certainly present (blaxploitation, rednecksploitation, muscle car movies, etc.), but this is primarily a western, which is wonderfully set up by Michael Madsen's down-on-his-luck international assassin character, Buck. Madsen's character could have simply been another sadistic Mr. Blond sociopath, but Buck has a tragic element to him. He was part of an elite group of international assassins, but he's now living in a trailer in the middle of the desert, working as a bouncer at a run down strip club, and even had to hock his Hattori Hanzo sword. Tarantino manages to give Buck a fair amount of character depth with minimal screen time, which is always a great thing to see. Though I think the action highlight of the film has to be the showdown between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah as the deadly one-eyed Elle Driver. Hannah had largely been absent from any films of note for quite some time, unless you count the Grumpy Old Men films ten years earlier and has sadly been absent from much since then, but she is terrific as Driver. I think a lot of credit also has to go to fight choreographer Yuen Woo Ping for the amazing fight between Thurman and Hannah in buds trailer. Tarantino also gets a lot of credit for selecting some truly bad-ass Ennio Morricone music for their final moments. Tarantino includes in his cast some other cool character actors including Gordon Liu (as a white bearded kung-fu master this time), Sid Haig, and Larry Bishop. And then there is David Carradine as Bill, who finally show his face on screen this time, and who is excellent. I can't imagine anyone else playing this role, even though there were some very cool other actors under consideration to play Bill before Carradine was cast. As with most Tarantino films, this is not a film to suit all tastes, but for those who enjoy Tarantino's aesthetic, this film is a real treat.",10,3,5,8 April 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," Winstead is terrific in this tight thriller that keeps you guessing.
","A crackerjack of a film that keeps the audience guessing from beginning to end. Co- written by Damien Chazelle, who wrote and directed La La Land, and produced by J.J. Abrams, who produced the other 'Cloverfield' movie about a giant Godzilla-like creature attacking NYC. '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a very different kind of story about Mary Elizabeth Winstead knocked unconscious in a car wreck only to find herself locked in an underground shelter by John Goodman, who tells her there has been some kind of incident or outbreak out in the world and that they must remain in the bunker to stay safe. Is she a prisoner? Is Goodman her savior or completely insane? Does she risk trying to escape, angering Goodman or facing the unknown outside? John Gallagher Jr. plays a third character also confined to the bunker, similarly brought there by Goodman and unsure if he's been saved or is a prisoner. These types of bottle-stories, with a group of characters confined to a small space, whether it's high art with 'Death and the Maiden' or whether it's exciting pulp as with something like 'The Thing,' are incredibly fun when they are done well and this one is done amazingly well. Winstead is quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses after this and following a great performance in season three of 'Fargo' (along with discovering her singing career with Dan the Automator in 'Got a Girl'). Goodman is terrific in his ambivalent performance where you cannot figure out if he's a devil or an angel. Directed by Dan Trachtenberg, who seems to have not made anything else of note before of after this, tightly directs the film, building incredible suspense at times, while also giving time for the characters to become fully fleshed out. SPOILER ALERT! I felt the film did go a bit off the rails at the end when Winstead does finally escape and she has to fight off giant space monsters. Don't get me wrong, it's all very fun, but it felt like I'd suddenly stepped into another film. It may conceptually be an interesting ending in that it ties this to a larger J.J. Abrams Cloverfield universe, but this film taken on it's own, it felt strange and unnecessary, especially considering how small and confined a majority of the film was to then suddenly get dropped into the middle of a giant Michael Bay Transformers movie (though maybe that was the intent). Still, 'Cloverfield 10 Lane' is an exciting, suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat kind of film that is a must see for fans of this sort of film. If you enjoy this type of set up, I'd recommend Xavier Gens' horror/thriller 'The Divide' about a group of survivors in a fallout shelter after a nuclear attack, although I have to warn you it's a pretty rough ride.",8,0,1,15 October 2017
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Hard to be objective, but this is a truly special film for me
","First off, I am so disappointed my children found this film boring when I took them to the theater for a 35th anniversary screening. They didn't hate it, but they did not get the sense of wonder and magic that I got when I watched this film as a child. Granted I was a few years older than them, but I'm still disappointed. Anyhow, 'E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial' drips in 1980s nostalgia, with Mike and his friends playing Dungeons & Dragons while ordering pizza from a corded telephone, Space Invaders t-shirts, references to someone getting the high score on Asteroids, BMX bikes prominently featured, and so on an so forth. That alone made this film fun to rewatch, but beyond Gen-X nostalgia, Steven Spielberg does what he did best during this period of his career, he brought a sense of magic to the world. Spielberg at this time also populated his world with characters who seem very real and identifiable. I was the exact same age as Henry Thomas when this film first came out (I suppose I'm same age now as well), so that likely also added to me feeling a strong connection to the characters in the story when I originally saw the film. Thomas is great and very genuine in his performance, but this was Drew Barrymore's first film and she really does steal every scene she's in. It's hard to say a six-year-old has star quality, or if it's the script, or if it was Spielberg, but she has some of the film's best moments; dressing up E.T., calling him a deformed kid, telling her brothers, 'Give me a break!' or her the film's heartfelt finale with E.T. telling Gertie to 'Beeeeeee... gooood.' The overall story is of a boy hiding a lost alien in his closet and helping him get home is charming, but I believe it's really all of these small moments that made this film great. It's as if 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' is entirely filled with precious Spielbergian scenes like the one from Jaws where Chief Brody and his son mimic each other at the dinner table. I couldn't get over how charming and innocent moments of the film were, particularly when Elliott first coaxes E.T. out of his closet and tells him all of his toys. Those little touches all add up to making the audience more connected with these characters, even if they don't necessarily forward the plot. Those are the scenes that stick in your mind, although the flying bicycles are certainly going to stick in your mind and are a big plot moment. A few things I don't think I picked up on when I originally watched this film was some foreshadowing of E.T. and Elliott's connection. Early on in the film when Elliott is getting food from the fridge, E.T. is startled by something in Elliott's room and shrieks, causing Elliott to also shriek and spill a carton of milk. Upon first viewing, you'd think it was E.T.'s shriek that startled Elliott, but it's the start of their psychic and physical bond between the two. The other part of the film that escaped me as a child was Elliott's mom, Dee Wallace and a great performance that's very nearly very easy to miss, struggling with being a newly single mom and a still coming to terms with a recent divorce. Her struggles as a parent are something I now identify with as an adult and allowed for a new emotional connection to the film and characters. It was also fun when rewatching the film to see how many tips-of-the-hat that were done in 'Stranger Things' to this film. It's no secret that 'Stranger Things' cribbed heavily form Spielberg, but I was struck by how spot on 'Stranger Things' was when I actually went back to watch a Spielberg film from that era. Overall, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a film classic and if Elliot saying, 'You could be happy here, I could take care of you. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. We could grow up together, E.T.' doesn't get to you, you have a heart of stone.",10,3,4,21 October 2017
Train to Busan," Unorigianal, but entertaining South Korean zombie movie
","The highest grossing film in South Korea of all time is a routine, but well made zombie thriller. The story begins at the outset of a zombie outbreak with a father and daughter finding themselves on a train to the town of Busan, hoping to escape the zombie plague around them. Unfortunately, the train has a number of folks who are slowly turning intro zombies, so the survivors aboard the train find themselves having to fight their way through the infected cars to get to the safe ones. This story may sound similar to 'Snowpiercer,' but 'Train to Busan' lacks that film's smart political subtext. 'Train to Busan' is simply trying to entertain and it does quiet successfully achieve that with tons of fast zombie action, some interesting set pieces, and solid special effects, which is all fine and good if you're into zombie movies. On the downside, I'm not a fan of fast zombies and prefer the slow lumbering Romero-zombies, just as I also prefer my zombie films to have a Romero-style political subtext. So overall, 'Train to Busan' manages to come up with some interesting situations and set pieces and does them well, it's all pretty vapid and you'll forget most of the film an hour after you've watched it.",7,2,5,12 July 2018
Dawn of the Dead," Unneeded remake is surprisingly good and satisfying for fans of the original
","Surprisingly good remake of the George A. Romeo zombie apocalypse classic. It's tricky doing a remake of a beloved cult classic, so when I originally went to the theater to watch this film, I went in expecting to hate it, especially since the film was written by the same guy who wrote the terrible live-action Scooby Doo movie, along with some first-time director I'd never heard of and who'd only done music videos and commercials. However, right from the opening moments of the film, with a quiet suburban neighborhood quickly descending into a fight for survival from zombie hoards to when the opening credits roll to Johnny Cash singing 'When the Man Comes' around, I was hooked! Little did I know that writer James Gunn would go on to write other terrifically smart and subversive mainstream genre films like 'Slither,' 'Guardians of the Galaxy' as well as the little seen low budget films like 'Super' and 'The Belko Experiment' and that director Zach Snyder would go on to tackle (more successfully than you'd expect) other sacred cows such as 'The Watchmen' and 'Man of Steel.' Compared to Romero's original, this remake is minus the political subtext Romero infused into all of his zombie films, but it does manage to capture the original film's balance of comedy and horror. Both films are for the most part straight faced horror films, punctuated with moments of levity and black humor. The remake delved less into the audience fantasy aspect of getting to have the run of a shopping mall (similar to 'Night of the Comet'), but the humor Gunn placed into his script was arguably much more witty when compared to Romero's more pie-in-the-face style of slapstick comedy. The remake also boasts a strong cast that includes Sarah Polley (a nurse), Ving Rhames (a cop), Mekhi Phifer (an expectant father), Jake Weber (a nice guy), Ty Burrell (a rich jerk), and Michael Kelly (a mall cop). Another charm of the film for fans of the original is that while it does deviate from the original in many ways (running zombie instead of slow zombies, changing most of the characters and scenarios, and keeping really only the basic concept of people holding up in a mall during a zombie apocalypse), the filmmakers included many Easter eggs and nods to the original films, including a truck crashing into a diner (a nod to a story shared by Ben in the original film) or the mall being named after the lead actress in the original film, or cameo appearances by the three stars of the original film (Scott H. Reiniger, Tom Savini, and Ken Foree), and many others. Overall, the world did not need or ask for a 'Dawn of the Dead' remake, but Gunn and Synder managed defy my fanboy reservations and won me over to their new vision of Romero's horror classic. Well worth watching for fans of contemporary zombie films as well as for fans of the old school original film.",8,2,3,14 July 2019
Passengers," Interesting premiss becomes a routine sinking ship survival tale
","Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt make a handsome couple in this sci-fi version of a desert island romance (think 'Blue Lagoon' or 'Swept Away' in space), but the film ultimately fizzles on a promising premiss and becomes a routine sinking spaceship story that is no 'Titanic.' 5000 passengers are aboard a space cruiser on a 120 year trip to a distant plant called Homestead II when Pratt finds himself unexpectedly woken up from his sleep chamber about 90 years too soon. Pratt goes a little crazy all alone on the massive ship, growing a bear, walking around naked, and basically losing his mind (think Tom Hanks in 'Castaway'), when he hits on the idea of waking up another passenger. Enter Jennifer Lawrence, who he wakes from her sleep, but doesn't tell her he woke her, instead blaming the faulty ship. Can their romance survive such a huge lie? Pratt's decision to wake her was essentially sentencing her to die with him, so should he ever tell her the truth or should he live with the lie? That kind of story is ripe with possibilities and almost reaches Andrei Tarkovsky 'Solaris' levels of smart science fiction, but instead those emotional, ethical, and moral implications are barely addressed and the plot instead quickly shifts into a routine 'THE SHIP IS FAILING' storyline where the two have to try to save their slumbering fellow passengers from dying in their sleep. If this was a desert island romance film, the equivalent would be the happy couple spending most of the film fighting pirates and completely ignoring the first half of the film's intriguing set-up. Considering the likable stars, a strong story premiss, and the lavish production values, this film was a real missed opportunity.",4,0,2,4 January 2019
Hostel," Unfairly dismissed as torture porn, it's one of the most effective horror films of the past 20 years.
","Unfairly dismissed as torture porn by many critics, this terrific horror film plays off audience expectations and takes them on a terrifying ride you cannot predict where it will go. The story revolves around a group of three Americans traveling through Europe, staying in hostels. Two are obnoxious party-boys and one is the nice-guy character. When one of the obnoxious guys is lured away by pretty girls, the two remaining become suspicious of what happened and begin to investigate. All the while, since the film opened with images of horrific implements of torture in a dark, dank torture chamber, the audience has already had seeds planted in their minds of what really happened. Writer/director Eli Roth does an amazing job of playing against horror film tropes and audience expectations, particularly (SPOILER ALERT) when he kills off the nice-guy hero of the film Marion Crane-style and the audience is left without a safety net. After that, it feels as if anything is possible, which has the impact of creating genuine suspense now that we've seen that all of the characters are expendable. Roth really knows his horror films (his first film, 'Cabin Fever,' was a slasher film without a slasher, and it completely worked), and he uses that knowledge to surprise the audience throughout. When the nice-guy is killed, it's as if all bets are off and anything can happen. It also helps that the film doesn't feature and name actors, because when you cast Brad Pitt in your film, you know Brad Pitt isn't going to be killed. This tension is olstered by Roth establishing early on in the film that he's not going to cut away from the violence and that he is going to show the audience the full bloody graphic horror of what's happening (and it's extreme!). As with the best horror films, 'Hostel' has an interesting subtext about America's interventionist nature around the globe and how that's received by the rest of the world. American arrogance is a ripe topic for a revenge-like thriller, especially when it's framed around an underground Eastern European business that caters to the depraved murderous desires of wealthy men who want the exotic adventure of torturing and murdering attractive youth without consequences.This film is credited (or accused) of ushering in the 'torture porn' horror subgenera, which it most certainly did. Extreme horror films, like 'Audition' or 'Ichi the Killer' had been around Asia Cinema for awhile, and Roth rightfully gives a not to those film with a cameo appearance by Takashi Miike, the likely the originator of 'extreme' horror films. 'Saw' did come out the year before, but it relied more on traditional implied horror instead of showing all the graphic violence (unlike it's subsequent sequels). Roth also provides other nods that horror fans will likely pick up on, such as the slow tracking shots of the door at the end of the torture hallway as a nice homage to the menacing door at the end of the hall in 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' Overall, 'Hostel' is a film that is not intended to appeal to a wide audience and not even to all horror fans, but for horror film fans of a hearty nature, this film is amazing!",10,1,4,23 December 2017
Blade," Before the hard-R superhero movie 'Deadpool' there was 'Blade'
","At this point, I'm painfully bored with superhero films (I'm a huge Joss Whedon fan and I can't even bring myself to watch his Avengers films), but if more film adaptations took a tone like 'Blade' I'd probably start showing interest and showing up to the theater again. Almost 20 years before audiences flipped out over the hard-R superhero movie 'Deadpool,' the lesser Marvel Universe superhero Blade smashed onto the scene with with this ultra bloody tale of modern day vampire hunting. Wesley Snipes plays Blade, a half human/half vampire who can walk in sunlight and uses that to his advantage as he hunts his vampire quarry. In this vampire universe, vampires have an underground secret society, who use their wealth and power to hide their existence and keep themselves well fed. That is until upstart vampire Stephen Dorff decides vampires should come out from the shadows and should claim their rightful place at the top of the food chain. It's a cool story set up, but what makes this film great is Snipes as Blade, the ultra slick direction by Stephen Norrington, and the unapologetic gore that made this movie standout at the time (though it still manages to stand out to this day among superhero films). Sure, 'Deadpool' and 'Kick-Ass' were super violent, but they were done with a a fair amount of humor. 'Blade' is a humorless and completely serious of film, mixing action and horror. In many ways, it's more of a hybrid of 'The Matrix' and 'The Hunger' and is less similar to any other superhero film of the past 20 years. 'The Crow' is probably is probably the most similar of comic book movie to this one, although I don't know if I'd really consider 'The Crow' a superhero movie either. Ang Lee's 'Hulk' may be the only other superhero movie since Blade to take what I'd consider a serious tone that wasn't afraid to embrace downbeat themes and not worry about being a wide audience crowdpleaser. I think Ang Lee intended his film to be a crowdpleaser, but it ended up not, although I think 'Hulk' is highly underrated and I would argue is the best of the recent big budget Marvel films (even if they rebooted the series and do not consider Lee's film part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe). But back to this film in particular, Wesley Snipes commands the screen as Blade, in what' is likely his most memorable onscreen role. His stoic low-voiced man-of-few-words demeanor does border on parody and will admittedly come off as silly if you're not into the spirit of the film, but it worked for me. Also, Snipes, a trained martial artist, has some of the best fight sequences of his career. In terms of story, writer David S. Goyer took the unique approach of not making the movie about Blade's origin story and instead the audience finds themselves thrust into the middle of a long simmering war waged by Blade agains the hidden vampire world. The audience's is introduced to Blade and his secret war by way of N'Bushe Wright, an innocent human who finds herself suddenly caught up in fight when she's attacked by a vampire. Director Norrington, as well as director of photography Theo Van De Sande, get a lot of credit for the film's slick look, with tightly edited action sequences and a cold austere vampire world bathed in cool blues and blacks (until it explodes in blood red). The film also greatly benefits from its' supporting cast, which includes not just Dorff, but also Kris Kristofferson as Blade's human helper, making all his weapons and gear, Donal Logue as Dorff's primary henchmen, Udo Kier as an establishment vampire opposed to Dorff, and even Traci Lords shows up as a vamp. There's also a fine atmospheric score by the always great Mark Isham. Also worth noting are some excellent practical special effects, particularly a memorable sequence with a Jabba the Hutt-like vampire is tortured by Blade's ultraviolet flashlight. However, there are some significant downsides to this film. The main one is that the film's best scene, the vampire rave blood bath, is the first scene of the movie and nothing that follows lives up to it. It really is a dynamite scene, with New Order music blasting, sexy vampires cavorting, and blood spraying down from the ceiling where the vamps have rigged blood to rain down from the ceiling fire sprinklers. That is until Blade shows up and mows them down in his trench coat with guns, stakes, high kicks, and samurai sword. Also to the film's detriment are that the characters are all rather underdeveloped. Sure they all have a backstories, but they are more archetypes than relatable or empathetic characters. The story also meanders a bit and loses momentum at times. There's also a rather lackluster and disappointing climax that didn't seem consistent with the rest of the film's slick modern setting. Writer Goyer has a pretty hit or miss track record and his best films included either co-writing credits by others or were made by strong directors like Christopher Nolan, Alex Proyas, or Guillermo del Toro, the director of the far superior Blade sequel. Left to his own devices, I'm not sure Goyer is that good of a write outside of developing solid story set-ups. Another complaint is that while the films did feature some excellent practical special effects, the CGI is consistently awful throughout the film. The CGI blood looks like Magic Marker, the vampire disintegrations from stakings and whatnot look like a bad TV show superimposed images, and when the vampires swell and explode the CGI just looks completely off. The CGI was distracting and takes you out of the film. Still, despite these fairly major deficits, 'Blade' manages to be a memorable horror/action film hybrid that is well worth watching flaws in all, although Guillermo del Toro's terrific sequel should have been the first film to launch this franchise and is the high point of the series.",7,1,2,4 June 2018
Creed," Worthy successor to the Rocky franchise is true to the original
","A fine successor to the Rocky franchise follows the son of Rocky Balboa's original opponent, Apollo Creed. The film opens with the young Creed, the illegitimate son of his boxer father, as a juvenile delinquent, but who is adopted by Apollo's widow (remember, the big Russian in 'Rocky IV' killed him). Picking up years later, Creed has a promising white collar career, but he continues to fight in underground Mexican boxing matches, as well as fighting his own demons to escape his father's shadow and find his own identity. He decides to quit his job and follow in his father's footsteps to become a boxer, fighting under the name Johnson instead of Creed and enlists the help of none other than Rocky Balboa to train him. The young Creed gets his big shot when it leaks out who his father is and when the champ, 'Pretty' Ricky Conlon, is looking for a last minute opponent, just as Creed senior did for Rocky in the original film. The film follows the Rocky underdog formula, with a terrific Michael B. Jordan as the young Adonis Creed having the prove himself to the world and to himself as well. Jordan makes Creed feel like a genuine person and not one of the many cartoon characters who populated later Rocky films ('Rocky Balboa' being the exception). This film differs from prior Rocky films in that Balboa is now a supporting character, but Stallone delivers a heartfelt performance that is his best since the original film. Also, this is the first Rocky film not written by Stallone, but the story's underdog nature, the father/son relationship, and, of course, the build-up to the big fight, all fit nicely within the Rocky formula. Directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler, he brings an indie film sensibility to a major studio film to great effect. Overall, 'Creed' hearkens back to the heart and soul of the original 'Rocky' in what I hope continues for the sequel now in production. Interesting factoid: Stallone is now the same age as Burgess Meredith when he played Mickey in the original film.",8,1,1,29 October 2017
The Natural," Baseball Americana/American Studies at it's best!
","Wonderful bit of Americana told through that most American of sports, baseball. Director Barry Levinson fashions a mythic tale about an over-the-hill 1920s baseball player, Roy Hobbs, finally getting his shot at the big leagues with the fictional New York Knights. Robert Redford plays Hobbs, himself in many ways a stereotypical All- American boy. Hobbs seemingly comes out of nowhere and no one knows where this talented player came from or why it took him so long to appear in the majors. Hobbs quickly gains fame an attention, and while on his journey faces many challenges; tempted by seductresses, facing down dark corrupting forces, and the lure of money and fame. As with most American myths and tropes, they have their roots in other cultures. The mythology presented in 'The Natural' seems heavily influenced by Greek Mythology, with Hobbs as a Homer-like hero on a journey to find home. Kim Basinger and Barbara Hershey plays a sirens. Darren McGavin and Robert Duvall plays dark, corrupting underworld god-like figures manipulating events. Glenn Close represents the home that Hobbs is seeking. Other actors of note in the film include Wilford Brimley as the team manager and Richard Farnsworth as an assistant coach. There's also strong supporting performances from Robert Prosky, Michael Madsen, Mike Starr, and Joe Don Baker in a small role that's a thinly veiled analogue for Babe Ruth. Randy Newman also deserve note for his beautiful score, as does director of photography Caleb Deschane. When a baseball smashes the ballpark lights in an explosion of sparks and rousing music are unforgettable and gorgeous. Barry Levinson has made some brilliant, including 'Diner,' 'Avalon,' and TV series like 'OZ' and 'Homicide: Life on the Street,' but I think this film may be my favorite of all of his fine work.",10,3,4,20 August 2017
Sleepy Hollow," Underrated Tim Burton homage to 1960s Gothic horror films
","Gnarled trees drip blood, Christoper Walken with sharpened teeth, and more decapitations than you can shake a stick at! Easily Tim Burton's grizzliest film and one of his most underrated. Burton consistently makes excellent films, but 'Sleepy Hollow' typically isn't the first film people think of when asked what's your favorite Burton film? However, 'Sleepy Hollow' really does deserve to be right up there as one of his best. It's deliciously bloody homage to 1960s Gothic Hammer Horror films and Italian horror pictures, ALA Mario Bava. Very loosely based upon the Washington Irving short story, this version has Ichabod Crane as a big city police detective sent into the small hamlet of Sleepy Hollow to solve a mystery surrounding a string of murders, beheadings to be precise. The film was written by Andrew Kevin Walker, the man behind the equally good, and grizzly, murder mystery 'Se7en' and he does the same solid job of crafting a respectable who-done-it. However, just as with 'Se7en,' this film's success is really thanks to a strong director and strong cast and less so the script. Johnny Depp plays a very smug and uptight Ichabod Crane who looks down his nose at the rubes populating Sleepy Hollow, with the exception of a blond haired Christina Ricci, who has him completely befuddled. While Crane is sophisticated and intelligent, he's completely lost when it comes to women, social interactions, and, in general, the ways of the world, which is where this film version falls in line with the Irving tale. There's also Bram Bones, the headless horseman, and a few other trappings from the original story, but for the most part, this film strikes out on it's own, but it does feature some very fun nods to the classic Disney version of the Irvings story. Besides Depp and Ricci, there's a strong supporting cast that includes Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDiarmid, Martin Landau, Ray Park doing the fighting scene for the headless horseman, Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman, and Hammer Horror veterans Michael Gough and Christopher Lee. Overall, Burton's one foray into a hard R-rated horror film is a real treat for fans of 60s Gothic horror films and more in general anyone who just wants to fun, scary, bloody good time.",9,1,1,10 December 2017
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino's bloody western chamber piece is more Agatha Christie than Sergio Leone or John Ford
","Terrific western from writer/director Quentin Tarantino is unexpectedly more Agatha Christie than John Ford. Bounty Hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth, played by the always wonderful and sadly underused Kurt Russell, is taking in wanted criminal Daisy Domergue, the also amazing Jennifer Jason Leigh, to hang. However, a blizzard forces them to hold up at a way station with a band of nefarious types, one or more of whom aren't who they say they are and are likely looking to free Daisy. In 'And Then There Were None' fashion, character begin to get offed, and to reveal much more of the plot would ruin the fun of the film. Like most Tarantino films, this one is likely not going to be for all tastes, even if the film features a stellar cast that includes Samuel L. Jackson as a fellow bounty hunter, Major Marquis Warren, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, and Tarantino even casts Matt Houston himself, Lee Horsley, as a stagecoach driver, great plotting, terrific suspense, shocking moments of violence, and as you would expect from a Tarantino film, some incredibly sharp dialogue. Comparing this film to Tarantino's other work, this one seems closest to 'Reservoir Dogs' in the sense that it's a bunch of characters stuck in a confined space doing a lot of talking and tough guy posturing, leading up to a bloody climax. And boy it is a wildly bloody climax, courtesy of special effect maestro Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger. But since Dogs, Tarantino has matured as a director and continues to top himself each time out, branching out and challenging himself with something new and different with each new film and 'The Hateful Eight' is no different. Also of note, the film features composer Ennio Morricone's first western score in many years and also his first American film score in quite some time (his last was 'Ripley's Game' in 2002). It's a strangely moody score when I was expecting a score filled with crazy stings and whistles, ALA Sergio Leone or Sergio Corbucci. Morricone's score is more along the lines of his score for John Carpenter's 'The Thing,' which this film actually uses some tracks from. But the highlight of nearly all of Tarantino's film is his dialogue and this film features more verbal sparring matches than any of his films, which is endlessly delightful. From the his first film, with Mr. White and Mr. Blond facing each other down ('Are you gonna bark all day little doggie? Or are you gonna bite?'), it was clear that Tarantino knew how to use dialogue to build tension, and his skills have only gotten better since then. The way characters play with one another, trying to outsmart and outwit one another is endlessly watchable. And upon a second viewing of the film and the dialogue can be reinterpreted and takes on new meaning once the audience knows character motivations and where the story is heading. Thematically, I think Tarantino has always played with genres but with this film is commenting on modern race relations through this tale of violent bounty hunters in a post-Civil War old west. It's the racial tensions following the Civil War that Tarantino uses to put the ugly views on race front and center that you can today hear on cable news or read online just about anytime you want. Of all his films, this one seems his most mature and I think arguable his best. Still, like most of his film, they are not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're a film buff, Tarantino's film vocabulary that he infuses into each of his films is utterly intoxicating.",10,4,8,27 July 2019
We Were Soldiers," Mel Gibson takes his savage depiction of warfare to Vietnam
","Mel Gibson did not direct this film, but his production company made the film and he served as producer, so his fingerprints are all over this film, once again bringing his savage depiction of war to the big screen in much the same way he did with 'Braveheart' and 'Hacksaw Ridge.' Randall Wallace was the writer and director of the film and had previously worked with Gibson as screenwriter on 'Braveheart' and is currently working with Gibson again on his new film 'The Passion of the Christ: Resurrection.' With 'We Were Soldiers,' Wallace and Gibson tell the true story of Lt. Col. Hal Moore in the first major US engagement with the North Vietnamese Army at the Battle of Ia Drang. Some of the events and characters were compressed for dramatic purposes, but the film is largely true to the real-life battle. The film beings with a Gibson and family living on an army base putting together a new unit for a mission overseas, entering into the first conflict of the Vietnam War, just as French forces were pulling out. Much time in this first part of the film is spent establishing the characters, two standouts being a grim Sam Elliott as Gibson's second in command and Greg Kinnear as a brash Cavalry helicopter pilot nicknamed Snakeshit, showing the men with their families, and introducing the various character dynamics while on base, but once they hit the fields of battle in Vietnam, the film is an unrelentingly brutal battle that makes up a majority of the film. Wallace does a masterful job of filming the battle scenes, especially when it comes to clearly defining the action and geography of the battlefield, which is no small feat given the scope of this battle and the many fronts needing to be shown, both in the air and on ground. The slow motion battle scenes lack the elegance of a Sam Peckinpah film, but are more in line with the straightforward brutality of Samuel Fuller or Gibson's own depiction of war. The battle scenes here are not your typical war film depictions when it comes to now shying away from showing the horrors of war. Even compared to Steven Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' this is an especially brutal war film that is best compared to Gibson's own 'Hacksaw Ridge.' As with Hacksaw, although the film does not shy away from a savage depiction of war, it's not at all an anti-war film and is instead a celebration of the US military and the men who serve. The film does not really go into the politics of the Vietnam war, which was probably for the best and would have undercut the film's celebration of these soldiers. After rewatching 'We Were Soldiers,' and something I wonder about after watching most films directed by Gibson, is if it's more something about his own nature in wanting to show on-screen depiction of extreme violence. Even with his film about the Mayans, Gibson managed to steer the story into one that was wildly brutal and violent. Gibson may just be a disturbed individual, but he's a hell of a filmmaker. On the downside for this film, when it cuts away from the battlefield to the wives back home, it comes to a corny maudlin grinding halt. Gibson's wife in the film, Madeline Stowe, takes it upon herself to deliver the notification letters to the wives of men killed in action instead of the faceless military men delivering the grim news. This homefront story in itself, focusing on the impact of war on the families back home, would have been a worth story to tell in and of it's own, but this subplot is given short shrift and feels more just tacked on as some sort of way to illustrate the human impact of war, but it's not given enough time to be fully explored, especially when it's clear that the filmmakers were much more focused on the battle elements of the film. Overall, 'We Were Soldier' is amongst the most powerful and frightening depictions of war ever committed to the screen, while at the same time celebrates and honors the military and the men who make up that fighting force, without any commentary on the war itself. Keri Russell, Chris Klein, Barry Pepper, and John Hamm also appear in the film. INTERESTING FACT: One of the real-life officers who survived the battle was Lieutenant Rick Rescorla. He died in the 9/11 attacks, while employed as Head of Security for Morgan Stanley, while making sure all of the company's employees had gotten out of the World Trade Center, which they did, and is in keeping with the brothers in arms type of heroism depicted in 'We Were Soldiers.'",9,1,1,15 July 2018
Begin Again," Charming and surprisingly unsentimental romcom defies genre expectations
","Charming and surprisingly unsentimental romcom defies genre expectations. Keira Knightly plays a NYC songwriter who's just broke up with her singer boyfriend, Maroon 5's Adam Levine who cheated on her. While feeling down, a friend drags her to a small venue where he's performing and pushes her onto stage where she's discovered by a down on his luck record producer, Mark Ruffalo. The easy romcom path would either have Knightly and Ruffalo falling in love or would have the two learn and grow from each other and then find happiness with their respected partners. Instead, the film plays against conventions and it's quickly apparent to the audience that writer/director John Carney wants to make a much more realistic story of love, forgiveness, and redemption, where at the end of the day everything is not all neatly wrapped up in a bow. Knightly and Ruffalo appear more as real people dealing with real situations than your typical romcom characters. Their sincere performances bolster the strong strips and this realism of their characters and emotions give the film an earnestness that's missing from similar stories. 'Begin Again' is also a celebration of music. From the heartfelt lyrics Knightly pours into her songs about her relationships or a magical moment early on in the film when Ruffalo listens to Knightly play a song on an acoustic guitar in a bar to an indifferent audience while he imagines added layers of drums, piano, guitars, and strings, seeing in his mind (along with the audience) what the song could become. The film is greatly helped in that this story of musicians, songwriters, and producers features songs that are actually good. These songs were written by Gregg Alexander and Glen Hansard of The New Radicals ('You Get What You Give'), and they are full of feeling that perfectly capture the pathos of the characters while at the same time are actual catchy tunes. There are also excellent supporting performances by James Corden as a fellow struggling musician friend of Knightley's, the always great Catherine Keener as Ruffalo's ex-wife, and Hailee Steinfeld as his moody daughter. Overall, 'Begin Again' is not an earth shattering film, but it is a genuinely heartfelt story and celebration of music that really sneaks up on you with its earnestness.",7,0,0,29 July 2019
Suicide Squad," 'The Dirty Dozen' meets the DC Universe
","I never really had any interest in watching this film when it was first released, but having been blow away by Margot Robbie's performance in 'I, Tonya' I wanted to see another of her films and unfortunately chose this one. There's a lot of potential with a story that has the 'worst of the worst' super villains being called upon for a chance at redemption by agreeing to go on a suicide mission to save earth. Think 'The Dirty Dozen' meets the DC Universe. Written and directed by David Ayer, I'd have loved to seen a hard edged, dark 'Training Day' version of a superhero film, but what we end up with instead is a lightweight PG-13 superhero underdog story. For a film that want's to be dark, this film features a pretty likable group of super villains. This film also reminded me how thin the DC Universe is with heroes and villains outside of the Batman and Superman. Okay, Deadshot and Harley Quinn are legit DC Universe figures, but when you have to include El Diablo and Captain Boomerang, you know there's not a rich pool of characters to pull from (for the record, I do own every issue of the 1989 run of El Diablo). There's also a very unpleasant overuse of CGI that had the effect of distancing me from the action on screen. Give me the stripped down street-level action of Netflix's 'Daredevil' any day. On the plus side for the film, Robbie is good as Harley Quinn, but she's really the only standout of the squad (unless you count Viola Davis as their tough boss, who is equally good and probably scarier than any of the super villains). Another plus is an occasionally retro soundtrack that I'm pretty sure was influenced by the much better 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' although this film's soundtrack falters when it dips into bland contemporary hip hop. You also get fight scenes choreographed by Richard Norton (a regular nemesis of Jackie Chan in his action films of the 80s and 90s), but much of hand-to-hand fight sequences are muted by the bombastic CGI, which is the big problem with this film. Batman and Superman films are better suited to ridiculously large scale set pieces and generally bombastic action, whereas this film should have been more of a gritty, nasty, punch-you-in-the-gut type of action film that was along the lines of 'Death Wish' with super powers. Overall, 'Suicide Squad' isn't a terrible movie, but it's an absolute missed opportunity.",4,0,0,27 January 2018
Taxi Driver," Profoundly disturbing but brilliant tale of urban isolation, obsession, and rage
","Arguably Martin Scorsese's best film, writer Paul Schrader's best screenplay, and actor Robert De Niro's best performance. De Niro plays unstable Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle who the film follows down his rabbit hole of isolation, obsession, and eventual violent rage. The plot, as it is, has Bickle working nights as a NYC cab driver, becoming infatuated with pretty campaign worker, Cybill Shepherd, but when he sours that relationship due to his weird behavior, he becomes obsessed with saving pre-teen hooker Jodie Foster from her slimy pimp, Harvey Keitel. The plot could easily have become a simple Charles Bronson/grindhouse tale of urban vigilantism, but it's much more than that. Much has been written about 'Taxi Driver' in terms of urban decay, isolation, desire, sex, misogyny, and as a critique of the media, all by others more eloquent than me, so I won't even try, but I will say that on a visceral level, the film is a ferociously disturbing piece of filmmaking. The audience is slowly drawn closer and closer to Bickle's madness, in a similar way to 'Repulsion' or 'Peeping Tom.'. The audience almost understands and sympathizes with his where his thinking is coming from and are found rooting for him against the even more despicable of characters during the film's disturbing finale. Scorsese has presented a New York City that truly is a brutal urban nightmare, but at the same time has created surreal hallucinatory vision of NYC that may only be Bickle's perception of reality. Also of note, the film features memorable performances by Victor Argo, Peter Boyle, and Albert Brooks. Additionally, this was the final film scored by Bernard Herrmann and he delivers a memorably unrelenting and oppressive score that ranks among his finest. Overall, 'Taxi Driver' is one of the finest pieces of cinema ever committed to celluloid, though due to it's profoundly disturbing nature will likely deny the film wide appeal.",10,3,5,15 October 2017
Over the Top," If you watch one arm wrestling movie... wait, there is only one
","Sylvester Stallone plays an underdog athlete getting his shot at the big-time and also a chance at redemption. No, this isn't Rocky Balboa. It's the story of Lincoln Hawk (an awesomely fake movie name), a truck driver/amateur arm-wrestler. In what is likely the worst 'sports' movie of all time, Stallone tries to win back his son and win a big arm wrestling completion at the same time. Said competition is hilariously filled with 80s style professional wrestling types of characters who seems to grunt and sweat more than speak human words. Even more ridiculous is Stallone's secret arm wrestling move where he repositions his hand to defeat his opponents, which begs the question, way aren't all of the other arm wrestlers using this same move or coming up with some sort of counter move after having seem Sly go 'over the top' several times during the picture? Whoever had the idea that audiences were clamoring for a film about the world of competitive arm wrestling was quite mistaken. That person was likely producer/director/studio head Menahem Golan. 'Over the Top' has added entertainment value for me, having recently watched the documentary 'Electric Boogaloo: The Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films,' which documented the rise and fall of Canon Films, including how this film's excesses contributed into Canon's eventual demise. Featuring wall-to-wall cheesy rock music (by the great Giorgio Moroder, no less) and non-stop product placements (everything from Alka-Seltzer to Pennzoil to BRUT cologne), this film is the typification of excess (or over-the-top, if you will) at it's most ridiculous. However, in the film's favor, I did get a lot of ironic entertainment value out of how mind boggling awful it is. I'll also say that I do honestly think Stallone is a good actor, despite what his detractors may say, even if it's hard to see it in this film. Although I gave this film two stars out of five, it really deserves much less. If your film is beat out at the box office opening weekend by 'Mannequin,' 'Outrageous Fortune,' and 'Platoon,' your film is likely not going to be a big success. Overall, if you're in the mood for a movie that's so-bad-it's-good, you might get ironic enjoyment from this nonsensical film.",4,0,3,25 December 2017
Doctor Strange," Marvel super hero films are now endurance tests and this was a true test
","I'm so tired to super hero films. They're all sound and fury and generally seem to waste the talents of excellent actors and filmmakers. Case in point, 'Doctor Strange.' If there was a Marvel movie that was going to revitalize my interest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it would have been this film. Doctor Strange is a different sort of superhero and usually tells different sorts of stories that are much more comics and science fiction in nature, compared to more common Hulk-Smash Marvel storylines. This film boasts an especially fine cast with Benedict Cumberbatch (BBC's 'Sherlock') as Stephen Strange and Mads Mikkelsen (who plays the lead in the brilliant and under seen 'Hannibal' TV series. Watch it NOW if you haven't!) as the villainous Kaecilius, along with Tilda Swinton and Rachel McAdams. But despite a strong cast, a more interesting of superhero than most, and top notch production values, it's hard to put my finger on what went wrong with the film. What I really think it is, is superhero fatigue. I'm just tired of superhero films and no longer have patience for this formula, even when it's well done. Yawn...",4,1,3,1 October 2018
Romeo + Juliet," Highly accessible and exuberant Shakespeare adaptation
","Wildly fun adaptation of William Shakespeare's play by writer/director Baz Luhrmann. Changing the setting of Shakespeare's plays for film adaptations isn't a new thing. It had previously been done as musicals, westerns, samurai films, gangster pictures, indie dramas about street hustlers, teen comedies, teen dramas, and so on and so forth, but none of those films brought the exuberance and audacity as this film. Set in a Venice Beach-like setting between two feuding wealthy business family empires, Brian Dennehy as Ted Montague and Paul Sorvino as Fulgencio Capulet, with their star cross lover children, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, in roles that really put their stars on the Hollywood map, at the center of the drama. The film faithfully follows the source material's story and all of the dialogue is taken straight from the play, but the dialogue is amazingly accessible and understandable from the actors speaking the lines in a very naturalistic manner. Laurence Olivier was actually criticized in his day for delivering lines in too naturalistic of a manner and not in the traditional more sing-song of manner, which Kenneth Branagh took even further, but this film puts that on a whole new level. Actors here are gangsters, street punks, and thugs and deliver their lines as such, but their words are accessible in a way I'd never seen before that retained Shakespeare's original words. In some ways, it's kind of like Martin Scorsese's 'The Last Temptation of Christ' where most all of the characters spoke as if they were off the mean streets of Brooklyn. In both cases it served to connect the characters and stories to modern audiences and crate less of a distance between the two. The film also drips of 1990s cool, with a very hip soundtrack and many fashions of the day (with a hint of Elizabethan). The film features a strong cast that also includes Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Rudd, Vondie Curtis- Hall, M. Emmet Walsh, Jamie Kennedy, and a memorable Vincent Laresca. But the real start is Bad Luhrmann, who's combination of visuals, sound, and editing created a film so full of energy and audacity that it stands apart from any other Shakespearian film adaptation and is something truly unique. My only complaint about the film is that the modernization of the story also makes Romeo and Juliet's drama and romance seem overly trite and self important in a way that I found annoying. To the teens and teen audiences, I'm sure their love and feelings are very real and serious and worthy of live & death, but at the same time these are kids and they really shouldn't be taking themselves all that seriously. Leo and Clair might as well be the self important teens from '13 Reasons Why' for how overly serious they take themselves. Still, I don't think middle age men were Luhrmann's target audience here (i.e. me), so my criticism is probably not valid (i.e. I'm just being a cranky old man). Still, this is a wonderfully original film that demands multiple viewings.",8,1,1,27 May 2017
The Lost City of Z," Ambitious if flawed tale of British explorer Col. Percival Fawcett
","I really wanted to give this film a perfect five-star rating because it is such an ambitious and unique film, telling the true story of British explorer Col. Percival Fawcett, who disappeared while searching for a lost city in the Amazon in the 1920s. Charlie Hunnam gives a riveting performance as the driven explorer working to prove himself to his peers (he's a military officer who'd never seen combat), working to restore his family's good name after being disgraced by his father, and working to financially provide for his family. There have been many masterfully made films about explorers, but I was most taken with how 'The Lost City of Z' was a near perfect blend of old fashioned Rudyard Kipling type of adventure story while also tapping into the likes of Werner Herzog's 'Aguirre, the Wrath of God,' unafraid of delving into Fawcett's obsession and creating a haunting, hallucinatory film experience. Gorgeously photographed by Darius Khondji ('Se7ven,' 'Delicatessen,' 'The Beach,' and many more), the film is worth watching for the location photography alone. What I think held this film back from being a masterpiece is that although it was at once a ripping old fashioned adventure film and also a smart meditation on obsession and escaping one's past, it never quite goes deep enough into either. It never goes as far as 'Aguirre' or 'Apocalypse Now' into it's heart of darkness, and it never fully embraces it's Edgar Rice Burroughs inner heart. Still, it's an ambitious film and Hunnam terrific in the lead, as is Sienna Miller as Fawcett's loyal wife who only sees him between expeditions. Overall, writer/director James Gray has made something unique and fascinating, which made me want to go back and look at some of his previous films, which I seem to recall being interesting, but also mixed bags.",8,1,2,29 October 2017
Burn After Reading," A weaker Coen Brothers comedy is still pretty darn good
","A weaker outing for the Coen Brothers is still a pretty good time. The film is a bit of a send up of spy pictures like 'Three Days of the Condor' or 'Enemy of the State' (an under appreciated spy flick of the 90s). In this Coen Brother version of a spies and espionage, it's a world populated by a bunch of dumbbells (George Clooney, David Rasche, J.K. Simmons, John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton), who end up circling a couple of fitness trainers (Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand) who stumble upon a draft of Malkovich's autobiography and thinks they've discovered top secret material they could sell to the Russians. From there this screwball comedy gets even crazier and sillier. I don't think I busted a gut quite as hard as I did for 'Raising Arizona,' but this film does have that same kind of silly frenetic tone that is unique to the Coens, so if you enjoyed that film, you'll probably enjoy this one, thought likely not quite as much.",6,1,2,12 August 2019
Baby Driver," Breezy crime film is pure cinema!
","Snappy crime film from writer/director Edgar Wright ('Shaun of the Dead,' 'Hot Fuzz,' 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'). Ansel Elgort, an actor who I was previously not familiar with but who is excellent, plays Baby, a young getaway driver paying off a debt to crime boss Kevin Spacey by pulling jobs for him. Baby is near the end of paying off his debt and getting out, but as with most crime films about criminals trying to leave the life, it pulls them back in. That synopsis does not do this film justice because Wright tells his story in a supremely cinematic of fashion. What I mean by that is that he tells his story in a way that it would not be the same if it were told in a book, a graphic novel, TV show, or other format. 'Baby Driver' is pure cinema. Baby wears headphones throughout the film to buffer the constant ringing in his ears from a childhood accident that killed his parents, which allows Wright to give this film an amazing playlist of the first order that includes everything from Dave Brubeck to The Dammed to Queen to Young MC. This is easily my favorite film soundtrack in a very long time! And as you would expect from a story about a getaway driver, Wright delivers a series of dizzying and thrilling car chase sequences, each better than the last. The film also boasts a strong supporting cast that besides Spacey includes Jon Hamm & Eiza GonzÃ¡lez as a husband/wife crime duo, Jamie Foxx as a dangerous nutcase, and Lily James as Baby's new girlfriend Debora. Everyone's performance is great all around, but this is really Edgar Wright's show and they're just living in it (or at least fleshing it out). With constant references to other genre films, this movie one that is a must see for cinephiles!",9,5,10,13 August 2017
The Thing," 'I dunno what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off.'
","I've of course seen this film many times before, edited for TV, on VHS, laserdisc, DVD, and now in crisp HD, and am happy to report that John Carpenter's classic horror film still holds up today as just as shocking, grotesque, claustrophobic, and as scary as hell as when it first came out in 1982. Without spoiling too much of the plot, Kurt Russell is part of a US outpost in Antarctica who encounter an alien life form that kills and then assumes the form of outpost members, leaving those still human unable to figure out who is friend or foe, ALA 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers.' A remake of the Howard Hawks produced 'The Thing from Another World,' Carpenter ups the suspense tenfold by not having one alien terrorizing the isolated team, but by having any and all of the characters a potential enemy. It's a chilling moment when a desperate Russell tells the group, 'I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now, so some of you are still human.' Members of that team are played by an excellent and varied group of actors who include Keith David, Wilford Brimley, T.K. Carter, Richard Dysart, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, and other character actors you'd know their face if not their names. The script is credited to Bill Lancaster (son of Burt), and is his only original film script outside of 'The Bad News Bears' (arguably the greatest sports film of all time) and an okay sequel, 'The Bad News Bears Go to Japan.' The script is stripped down and efficient in a way that perfectly matches Carpenter's directorial sensibilities. When this film came out it was considered wildly gory in it's grotesque graphic violence, courtesy of special effects wizard Rob Bottin. SPOILER ALERT! I remember my mind exploding the first time is saw the a head extricate itself form it's burning body and then sprout spider-like legs to escape. The same can be said for the chest cavity opening up to bite off Richard Dysart's arms, and for so many other moments of the film that were a result of Bottin's truly monstrous creations, which are masterfully shot and edited by Carpenter for full cinematic impact. The film also greatly benefits from sharp photography by Carpenter's regular DP Dean Cundey, who'd later go on to work regularly with Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard on high profile Hollywood films. And enough cannot be said for the score by Ennio Morricone, which interestingly sounds more similar to a John Carpenter score than a Morricone score. Morricone at this point had done some work for Hollywood films ('Days of Heaven' and 'The Exorcist II'), but this is the film that really started landing him some bigger Hollywood pictures titles, like 'The Untouchables' and 'In the Line of Fire.' It's also fun to watch rewatch this film if you've seen Quentin Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight' due to Tarantino's many nods to Carpenter's film, whether he did them intentional or not, Overall, if there was ever a perfect marriage of science fiction and horror by a quality filmmaker, 'The Thing' is that film.",10,3,7,15 January 2018
21," Not exactly 'Rounders' but is breezy fun.
","Kevin Spacey plays an MIT mathematics professor who recruits his brainiest students to be part of his secret team of blackjack card counters and spotters. Jim Sturgess is the main character and is Spacey's newest recruit. Loosely based on a true story (in real-life all of the mathletes were Asian) the film does stretch credibility at times, but Spaces is amazing and in one of his wonderfully acerbic and snarky roles, and the film has a hip feel to it, featuring cool songs by MGMT and Peter Bjorn & John, and Laurence Fishburne is a lot of fun as a glowering casino fixer type of character who's out to get Spacey over an old beef. This film is breezy summer entertainment and is not a dark edgy poker movie like John Dahl's 'Rounders,' but it is still solid entertainment.",7,1,1,19 August 2017
U-571," Ripping good old fashioned WWII action/adventure submarine tale
","Exciting and suspenseful WWII adventure tale is more 'Where Eagles Dare' or 'The Dirty Dozen' than 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Dunkirk.' Those are all great WWI films, but the former are lighter depictions of war and primarily use this period of history as a backdrop for a ripping good adventure tale than any sort of historical insight. In 'U-571,' a small group of US navy seamen set out on a secret mission to steal an Enigma machine to help crack German U-boat coded messages. To get the machine, they plan to pose as German mechanics and meet up with a Nazi sub in the middle of the Atlantic and to then hijack the sub like it's the opening of Steven Seagal's 'Under Siege.' Their plan succeeds, except that (SPOILER ALERT!) their own sub gets blown up and they find themselves marooned on a German sub with a skeleton crew. To make things worse, mission commander Bill Paxton is killed and young officer Matthew McConaughey now finds himself in charge and struggling with his new leadership position. When this film first came out, it was at the same time I was getting my school administrator license, so I found the film's themes around leadership and qualities of a good leader interesting. I particularly liked Harvey Keitel's lower-ranking Chief Petty Officer and how he coaches McConaughey on how to be a leader, telling him what the men he's leading need and helping him to step up into that role. The cast also includes Jon Bon Jovi, David Keith, and Jake Weber. 'U-571' was directed and co-written by Jonathan Mostow, an underrated action director who made the excellent Kurt Russell thriller 'Breakdown' and the under appreciated third Terminator film. All of his film have echos of classic Hollywood adventure and action films in a way that's a welcome contrast to the a majority of the over-directed Hollywood action films nowadays. Mostow's action feels more Robert Aldrich or Walter Hill than say Michael Bay or Paul W.S. Anderson, which is something I wish we had often in action films. I'll take 70s and 80s muscular action films over bombastic 3-D, IMAX, CGI blockbusters that predominate today's multiplexes anytime. Overall, 'U-571' may not be all that historically accurate or be some magnum opus about men-at-war, but it is a ripping good adventure story. FUN FACT! The allied forces did steal an Enigma in real-life, except it was the British and not the US to led the daring mission.",7,0,2,17 September 2018
The Shining," Terrific haunted house story is not as scary as it once was
","I recently rewatched 'The Shining' on the big screen at a revival showing and was struck by how it has aged and now only seems mildly frightening. I remember being terrified of the twins, the elevators of blood, and Jack in the hedge maze. Still, even though the film has lost some of its scare factor, 'The Shining' is a fabulous piece of cinema. I won't bother summarizing the plot, because this is a film everyone has seen and if you haven't watch it NOW. Masterfully directed by Stanley Kubrick, his use of the Steadicam gives the film a dreamlike quality, floating though the empty hotel hallways and hedge mazes, which beautifully compliments the film's supernatural story. This was a new technique at the time and it still stands out as one of my best uses of this technology (Scorceses use of it in 'Goodfellas' is probably the other standout). Although not as edge of your seat as contemporary horror films (Mike Flanagan's 'The Haunting of Hill House' is an excellent example of a film that manages to be both scary and intelligent, which 'The Shining' was in it's day), but Kubrick's film does maintain a wonderfully creepy atmosphere. The photography by John Alcott ('Barry Lyndon' 'A Clockwork Orange' 'The Beastmaster') is as gorgeous. It's interesting to note that this is a haunted house story shot on brightly sunlight sets, compared to the typical dark-and-stormy-night setting of most horror films. Roy Walker's production design and Leslie Tompkins art direction are both beautiful and terrifying in their starkness. No review of 'The Shining' would be complete without mentioning Kubrick's masterful selection of music for the film. Wendy Carlos provided a few pieces, but a majority of the frightening music were compositions that, believe it or not, already existed. This film introduced me to György Ligeti, Krzysztof Penderecki, and Béla Bartók. Kurbrik brilliantly places the music into the film to a highly effective degree. Thematically, there are many theories on what the film is about (see the hilarious documentary 'Room 237' for some outrageous theories, though that film is less about the dissecting 'The Shining' and is more about how people get sucked into conspiracy theories and look to make order, seeking out patters and connections where they don't actually exist), but what the story of 'The Shining' really boils down to is the horrors and challenges family, parenting, and marriage. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Jack is having a midlife crisis. He wants to be a writer, but he now has responsibilities, a wife and a child who he increasingly beings to view as getting in the way of his life. He even tells Loyd, the ghostly bartender, at one point that he's losing who he is. From Wendy's perspective, Jack doesn't appreciate her cheerfully running the house and Wendy begins to lose her own mind over this as well, while poor Danny is caught in the middle. Looking for an escape from his responsibilities, Jack begins drinking again (he's a recovering alcoholic) and is even tempted by another woman at one point. Minus all the supernatural elements, this really is a domestic drama. This all was more at the forefront of King's book, which got watered down somewhat for the film version since Nicholson goes crazy pretty much right off that bat, which is a negative point on the film and was the crux of King's outspoken criticism of the film. King much preferred the TV-mini series version directed by Mick Garris and with Steven Weber as Jack Torrance. That version is much closer to the book and the highly identifiable Weber much better conveys King's focus on the horror of seeing your very ordinary father wrestle with his demons versus the very unordinary Nicholoson (no one's dad is like Jack Nicholson), but the TV-mini series is nowhere as cinematic as Kubrick's big screen opus. Overall, 'The Shining' remains a classic, but it is a film that has lost some of its sparkle over the years, mostly likely due to it being endlessly copied, which consequentially leaves the film feel somewhat stale by comparison. Irregardless, it remains a compelling and visually stunning film to behold.",9,2,3,16 March 2020
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Archetypal 'A Boy and His Dog' story except with a Terminator
","It never occurred to me before, but T2 is really an archetypal 'A Boy and His Dog' story along the lines of 'Old Yeller' or 'Pete's Dragon' or 'ET: The Extraterrestrial.' I'll assume anyone reading this has already seen the movie, so spoilers ahead. Arnold Schwarzenegger was a huge star when this sequel was made, so this time he HAD to be the hero of the film, this time becoming the protector of a young John Connor, who is being hunted by a more advanced Terminator model played to perfection by Robert Patrick with cold animal-like predatory menace. The 'Boy and His Dog' story starts fairly quickly, as a young John Connor befriends the futuristic killer cyborg. Connor teaches him tricks (i.e. that car keys are often under sun visors and, of course, 'Hasta la vista, baby'), the boy and his pet Terminator save each other at different points in the film, and in the end John has to give his beloved Terminator a sad farewell that's every bit as touching as when the boy in 'Old Yeller' says to his mama 'Listen. Old Yeller just saved your life and Elizabeth's, too. And he saved mine and Arliss'. We can't. We don't know for certain. I'll pen him up where he can't get out. A-and then we'll wait. We could not shoot up like he was nothing. Don't you understand?' Or when Elliott in 'E.T.' tells his pet alien 'You could be happy here, I could take care of you. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. We could grow up together, E.T.' And in T2, it's every bit as touching when the Terminator tells John there is another Cyberdyne chip that must also be destroyed, to which John replies, 'No, no no!! It'll be okay. Stay with us! Don't do it. Please... don't go --' with tears streaming down his face. So my point here is that you pair the durable 'Boy and His Dog' story with wildly exciting and muscular action courtesy of director/co-writer James Cameron (man, do I wish he'd make a straight-up non-preachy action film again ALA 'The Terminator' or 'Aliens') and strong performances by Patrick as the T-1000, Edward Furlong as the young John Connor, and particularly Linda Hamilton as the fierce and buffed our tiger mom, Sarah Connor, you have a movie that's pretty irresistible. The CGI does seem fairly primitive at times, but most of it surprisingly holds up with the mix of practical and CGI when displaying the T-1000's knives and stabbing weapons. If I did have a complaint upon rewatching T2, it's that the sequel shifted too greatly in tone from the original, relying too much on one-liners and comedic elements. Admittedly, the one-liners are good and the comedy is genuinely funny, but the hard edge of the original is what makes that first film easily the best in the series. Still, sequels of this era had a penchant for radical shifts in tone and story (i.e. 'Mad Max' to the 'The Road Warrior' or 'First Blood' to 'Rambo: First Blood Part II'). Overall, although T2 takes a major shift in the direction of family-friendly with the 'A Boy and His Dog' storyline, but the characters, story, and especially the action are brilliant and impossible not to enjoy.",9,0,0,24 March 2020
The Patriot," Severely flawed in it's whitewashing of history, but exciting and highly entertaining
","This film came out around the same time as star Mel Gibson's 'Braveheart' and I remember people thinking he'd directed this film as well, particularly because of savage battle scenes. However, 'The Patriot' was directed by Roland Emmerich, the reliable producer/writer/director of many enjoyable but empty headed summer popcorn films, including 'Independence Day,' 'White House Down,' and 'Stargate.' While most of his films are unchallenging crowd pleasers, 'The Patriot' stands apart in his filmography as quality piece of filmmaking. The film was written by Robert Rodat, who also wrote 'Saving Private Ryan,' and he brings the same mix of realism and and emotion to the American Revolutionary War that he brought to WWII. Mel Gibson plays a farmer and retired war hero who wants nothing more than to left alone with his family and to run his farm. However, Gibson is pushed to his limits by Jason Isaacs, best known as the sneering Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter films, who play as a sneering British Colonel. Gibson's fictional Benjamin Martin is an amalgam of several Revolutionary War heroes, but primarily seems to be based upon Francis Marion, The Swamp Fox, who was a pivotal figure during the war, leading a group of irregular soldiers in a guerrilla war against the British in South Carolina, even after the Continental Army had been driven out the state. After Gibson's son, Heath Ledger, is captured by Issacs, Gibson leads his own ragtag band of soldiers against the redcoats using what was at the time was very unusual guerrilla tactics. The small and large scale action sequences in 'The Patriot' are the real highlight of the film. They are exciting, brutally realistic, and most importantly, are emotionally poignant. There is an early scene in the film when Gibson ambushes a British detail to free his captured son, Ledger, where he uses his very young sons as his soldiers, and the filmmakers don't shy away from the young children's shock at their father telling them how to kill men, as well as taking time to show the aftermath and their reaction to their father's brutality. Besides being and exciting and unflinching in it's graphic and realistic presentation of war, it's the emotional component that elevates 'The Patriot' from simply being a technically effective crafted battle sequence. However, although the film does a fine job of presenting a realistic depiction of war for this time period and also does an excellent job of period detail in terms of costumes, architecture, and set decor, the film grossly fails in it's whitewashing of history in an attempt to present a politically correct hero who's more palatable to audiences.. As I said before, 'The Patriot' is a work of fiction, but having Gibson's Martin 'paying' his black farmworkers instead of owning slaves seems wildly disingenuous (Francis Marion owned slaves). Additionally, the real-life Francis Marion committed many war atrocities, even by the standards of his time, which are completely absent in this film, although there are hints of something in Gibson's past during the French and Indian War. If 'The Patriot' had been as honest in it's depiction of history in these respects as it had been in it's depiction of warfare, this film may have been a true classic. Despite this major lapse, 'The Patriot' remains a strong piece of filmmaking, with an emotional center that focuses around family, which gives the film a resonance that is lacking from many war films. Well worth watching despite it's flaws.",8,1,1,23 November 2017
Dunkirk," Heroism amid defeat in an epic war film told on a personal level.
","There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who love Christopher Nolan films and those who find them pretentious and tedious experiences. I'm in the former and found this film utterly brilliant. Set before the United States entered WWII, the film retells the the British defeat by the German Army at Dunkirk, where they were surrounded on all side by German forces, trapped along the shores of France and desperately trying to retreat back to England. The story unfolds almost wordlessly, following several individual stories amongst what must have been thousands of personal stories. One is of a group of infantrymen trying desperately to sneak ahead in line to get aboard a ship bound for England. Another follows one of the many civilian ships, crewed by a father and two sons, who risked all crossing the channel to bring their boys home. Another thrilling storyline follows an airman who must protect English civilians and soldiers, while watching out for German planes, all the while also watching his dwindling fuel supply. The film is incredibly suspenseful and at times terrifying, which was a bit of a surprise considering the film's PG-13 rating, but that's a big tip-of-the-hat to writer/director Nolan talents behind the camera. What struck me most about this film was how it was able to fully capture the scope of this battle, but did so by telling the the story from three very individual experiences. Time will tell, but I believe this film will one day stand amongst the like of 'Paths of Glory,' 'The Battle of Algiers,' and the other greatest war films of all time.",10,2,10,3 September 2017
Saw III," Respectable sequel is better than subsequent sequels but not as good as previous films
","The first 'Saw' film was an excellent grizzly thriller and the first two sequels were surprisingly good even though they were taken over by another director, Darren Lynn Bousman. I think what I liked most about these sequels is that the director was willing to kill off many main characters from the earlier films. This sequel also benefits from James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the writers of the original film, returning to write the film. This time Jigsaw, Tobin Bell, dying in a hospital bed, but with the help of Shawnee Smith is still able to carry out his games, kidnapping a doctor who's son was killed in a hit-and-run accident and putting him through a series of games/choices/situations where he can exact his revenge on those responsible. The first 'Saw' film was unfairly written off as torture porn, when it's really a terrific suspense thriller that happens to be excruciatingly gory. However, the subsequent sequels, this one included, are the typification of the torture porn genre, which is either a good or bad thing depending upon your feelings of the horror sub genre. As films of this disreputable genre go, 'Saw III' is nowhere close to being as good as 'Martyrs' or 'Hostel,' but is far better than the worst of the genre (i.e. 'Turistas' or the 'I Spit on Your Grave' remake). Donnie Wahlberg, Dina Meyer, and Betsy Russell also appear in the film, and composer Charlie Clouser returns to provide another effectively unsettling score.",5,1,1,1 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 1960s Hollywood nostalgia mixed with wish fulfillment
","I'll make the bold statement that this is writer/director Quentin Tarantino's best film thus far. However, 'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' is also Tarantino's most specific and idiosyncratic of film, which is saying something from the man who's made a career of making incredibly idiosyncratic films seemingly made only to sate no one but his own tastes in cinema, which makes the film also his least accessible. The story revolves around fading Hollywood star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his loyal stuntman/personal assistant Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) figuring out what to do next with his career. Having been the star of a number of Audie Murphy-type of genre pictures and the TV western 'Bounty Law' (which Tarantino actually wrote multiple teleplays for and teased he'd like to film on day), Dalton now finds himself relegated to guest spots on TV series as the villain so producers can build up their new stars by showing them killing off the star of 'Bounty Law.' Dalton has to make big career choices, deciding whether to continue acting on American television or consider opportunities to star in low budget Italian productions, much like Clint Eastwood did following his stint on the TV western 'Rawhide,' as did many other fading Hollywood stars and B-level actors. The other significant story thread that looms large over the film is Dalton's new neighbors, real-life director Roman Polanski and his young wife, actress Sharon Tate. They are introduced early and although a majority of the film follows Dalton and Booth, the audience is kept in suspense with the prescient knowledge of the horrific Manson Murders. The Dalton/Booth story and Manson story cross paths when Booth flirts with a hippie chick who invites him to drive her out to Spahn Ranch, home to the infamous Manson Family, as well as a blind and bedridden George Spahn, a brilliant Bruce Dern, who's renting his rundown backlot western town to the group. The film's one scene at Sphan Ranch is the closest Tarantino has ever come to making a horror film and the scene is incredibly creepy and unsettling. Tarantino does what he does best, which is build slow burn suspense that grows to an always satisfying climax (i.e. Bruce facing down Zed and Maynard, the opening scene of 'Inglourious Basterds,' or almost any scene in 'The Hateful Eight). What he does so well in his films is that he establishes the threat of violence and keeps ratcheting it up until you can't stand it any longer, climaxing in an explosion of violence, which makes me really wish Tarantino get behind the camera for a full-on horror film. But I digress. 'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' is a love letter to the era it's set, creating a fairy tale world where there is a mourning for the passing of old Hollywood as well as a celebration of the new. It's hard to say whether I enjoyed more the film's characters and story or it's recreations of 1960s Hollywood. The Cinerama Theater, Bruce Lee working as Kato on the set of the Green Hornet (getting his ass handed to him by Brad Pitt's Cliff Booth in a somewhat controversial of a scene), to the charming backlot filming of various TV shows and movies, are all utterly enthralling in this Hollywood dreamland. This is one of those films where you just want to step onto the screen and live in this world. Though equally compelling are Tarantino's characters and plotting, which get better with each film. While DiCaprio's Dalton is completely vapid and self absorbed, but the audience can't help but root for the guy. While he's seemingly an empty shell, Dalton is talented and his loyalty to Booth is endearing, as is Booth's loyalty to Dalton. There's one scene in particular that stands out in the middle of the film where Dalton has a crisis-of-faith moment while making a TV western guest villain appearance where he pours his heart out to a precocious child actress whom his TV villain has kidnapped. The scene manages to be sincere, touching, and utterly hilarious. The child address, Julia Butters, nearly steals the scene from DiCaprio. With the exception of the film's finale, this is likely the most memorable scene in the film. As with most of Tarantino's films, he features a cast that's as eclectic as they are talented, which includes Margot Robbie as Tate, Emille Hirsch as her friend, Timothy Olyphant as an up-and-coming TV actor, Dakota Fanning as Squaky Fromme, and also Luke Perry, Al Pacino as a hilarious agent, Kurt Russell as a stuntman (possibly connected to Stuntman Mike in 'Death Proof'?), Lena Dunham, Maya Hawke, Danielle Harris, Martin Kove, Clu Gulager, Rumer Willis, Rebecca Gayheart, Zoe Bell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and James Remar. Tarantino often has great casts in his films, but this one is really special. Robert Richardson captures the era with dynamite photography, which feels both nostalgic while also capturing the Hollywood fairy tale elements of Tarantino's vision. Much credit also has to go the the production design team, who made this feel like an authentic vision of 1969 Hollywood, though it could very well be the Hollywood versions of 1960s Hollywood, and in either case, it's stunning. And without spoiling anything, the film's finale is ridiculously fun. In summary, if you love the types of films Quentin Tarantino loves, which runs the gamut of low-budget genre pictures to foreign arthouse flicks, you will find 'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' an utterly enchanting film experience.",10,11,16,22 December 2019
A Quiet Place," Smart post-apocalyptic horror film is really about the terrifying responsibility of parenting
","Smart small-scale post-apocalyptic horror film is really about the horrors of parenting. John Krasinski co-wrote, directed, and stars as the father of a family living in a world where monstrous blind creatures roam the countryside hunting by sound, forcing the family to live in near complete silence. The film begins 89 days after the monsters first appeared and Krasinski and family seem to be the only ones left alive, introduced without explanation, walking barefoot into town to get supplies and medicine. The family has an advantage in this new silent world in that their oldest daughter is deaf and they all know sign language. The film is endlessly fascinating, seeing how the family has adapted to survive in this silent world, creating sand paths to quietly get from place-to-place, leaving all door open to avoid noise, and an elaborate system of colored lights to silently communicate danger. Different ways the family has adapted to live in silence are shown throughout the film and are a great hook to hold audience interest (Don't even ask about Krasinski's wife, Emily Blunt (who are a real-life married couple), being pregnant and their plan for how to keep the infant quiet!). From a filmmaking perspective, 'A Quiet Place' is unique in it's use of silence and reliance on visuals to tell its story. Most horror movies rely on jarring sounds and pounding music to build suspense, while Krasinski has crafted a film where the smallest sound becomes terrifying. Even more impressive, from a storytelling perspective, Krasinski has created what is essentially a modern day silent film. There is almost no spoken dialogue and most of the film has the characters communicating through ASL. The original plan was to not include subtitles for the ASL, but at the last minute the filmmakers decided to include them. I chose to watch the film without subtitles and it worked perfect without, which is a testament to Krasinski's talent as a writer/director, as well as credit to the talents of the actors involved. Original ideas for horror films are rare these days, and this was a pretty clever twist on the tired end-of-the-world scenario, but what makes 'A Quiet Place' a cut above most of its ilk is the film's emotional depth. Most post apocalyptic and horror films are simply exciting survival tales, and this film is certain that, but at its core it's about the terrifying responsibility of parenting. The most resonant parts of the film are the parents' constant vigilance to keep their children safe, teaching them how to survive in this new world, and their guilt over mistakes that have made (even when it was not their fault). This identifiable human emotional level is often missing from horror films, but when it is present, it makes the suspense and horror elements all the more terrifying, which is what makes 'A Quiet Place' one of the most effective horror films of recent memory. Well worth watching, even for non-horror fans!",8,0,0,22 January 2019
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Painfully slow second act nearly kills this early Miyazaki film
","I'm a big Hayao Miyazaki fan and had not seen this one before, so I was fairly excited to watch this film on the big screen. However, I was a bit disappointed and would have to say this is the weakest of Miyazaki's films I've seen. The story of the young Princess Nausicaä, who has a connection to nature, is seeking peace between three warring kingdoms and wishing to restore the earth's environment seem like ripe Miyazaki fodder, but this film is slow moving and the pro-environmental message was preachy and heavy-handed. Miyazaki almost always has a pro-environmental message in his films, but this one seemed to hit you over the head with it. But the main problem with this film is a deathly slow second act. The film starts strong and has a reasonably good conclusion, but the middle section is pretty lifeless, which is exacerbated by a lack of interesting characters outside of the titular princess. Overall, I suppose this is worth watching for Miyazaki fans, but it's certainly not a good entry point for those new to his work.",5,1,6,21 October 2017
Coco," Not as good as 'Up,' but better than 'Cars' 1, 2, or 3
","Pixar story about a young boy who wants nothing more than to be a musician, except that his shoemaker family has forbidden music due to the boy's great great grandfather abandoning the family long ago to pursue a life as a musician (Coco is the boy's very elderly great grandmother, and daughter of the shunned musician). The film takes place during Dia de los Muertos, the Mexican holiday where families remember and celebrate their deceased relatives, and when the film's hero, Miguel, discovers his runaway relative is actually the famous star of music and film, Ernesto de la Cruz (voice by Benjamin Bratt), he sets out to seize his moment by entering a music contest, only to find himself transported to the colorful and vibrant land of the dead. There he find a world populated by skeletal deceased relatives waiting to be remembered by their families so they can return to the world of the living to once again be with their descendants and loved ones. Miguel must find a way back to the world of the living before the end of the night, but that's not as easy as he expects when he discovers his relatives in the land of the dead also continue to hold music in contempt and refuse to help unless he renounces music. But wait! Ernesto de la Cruz is a relative and a musician, but he's just as famous in death as he was in life, so for Miguel to get to de la Cruz is no easy task. Miguel is aided on his quest by Héctor, a down-on-his-luck character who claims to know de la Cruz, but who is beginning to fade away from this world because his family no longer remembers him. Without spoiling any plot points, it's the themes of family and being remembered by your children and descendants that tugs at the heart strings and is at the core of the film. Pixar does sentiment better than anyone (I still get weepy just thinking of Bing Bong's farewell scene from 'Inside Out'), where it's rarely maudlin or saccharine, and is typically genuine and easily identifiable. The idea of being forgotten by your family is one that will hit home for parents watching the film, and the themes around family connections will be identifiable for both kids and adults. Setting the story aside for a second, I haven't even mentioned the film's lively music ('Remember Me' is a real ear-worm), it's clever sense of humor (Miguel's street dog friend steals most every scene he's in), and the film's eye-popping visuals. It's also very cool for a major studio film to not feature a single anglo character and to instead feature a characters outside the dominant culture of the United State. My main complaint about the film is it's over reliance on plot devices and episodic adventures that were rather forced and relied once too often on coincidence, but I'm sure this will only annoy adults and the kids won't even notice. Overall, 'Coco' is a solid entry in the Pixar canon of films, and athough it's not quite up to 'Monsters Inc.' 'Up' or 'Toy Story 3' standards of greatness, it's still far better than any of the 'Cars' movies.",8,0,2,18 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Rain Johnson takes the new trilogy beyond a simple fanboy exercise
","I went into the film with goodwill, wanting to like it, but I also had modest expectations given some of the varied opinions out there. The film's first 20 minutes or so seemed really by-the-numbers and was not grabbing me at all, starting off with a routine space battle with no story build-up to get the audience invested, Luke saying he doesn't want to train Rey, and Rylo Ken/Ben Solo getting talked down to by his master, the Supreme Leader. Ho hum. But when the film started to get more into character driven stories than plot driven ones, the film really takes off. That opening exposition did set up some great character driven storylines, the most welcome of which involves a new character, Rose Tico, a mechanic working for the resistance who's sister was killed during that opening space battle. Rose's story as a low level true believer in the resistance getting caught up with main players Finn and Poe Dameron is terrific and a great hook for audiences to enter into the Star Wars universe with a fangirl of these rebel heroes. The main storylines in the film involve the rebel fleet fleeing the New Order while low on fuel and unable to jump to light speed, Rey trying to get Luke to come back and help lead the resistance while also telepathically linking to Rylo Ken and trying to draw him to the light side of the force, and lastly a secret plan by Finn, Poe Dameron, and Rose to sneak aboard a Star Destroyer to save the retreating rebel fleet. While those all seem very plot driven, writer/director Rian Johnson makes these stories dependent upon character and that's why this entry into the new trilogy really works so well. The last of the three plot lines, about sneaking onto a Star Destroyer to exploit a design flaw, is a very played out plot device for a Star Wars film, but Johnson plays against audience expectations and makes it work. Johnson also plays against expectations with the commanding officer of the rebel fleet being played by Laura Dern. It's unexpected casting, and don't get me wrong, Dern is a terrific actress, but is not someone who I'd have pictured in a Captain Kirk/Captain Adama type of role, but she commands the screen with power and grace. This being unexpected for me may be my male centric/chauvinistic perspective, but I want to commend the filmmakers for prominently featuring women in heroic/action roles throughout the film. 'The Force Awakens' did this some by making Rey the main character, but 'The Last Jedi' noticeably had more women as fighter pilots, on the command bridge, and in other leadership roles. This made me realize how male dominated the original and prequel trilogy were. The other character point that Johnson gets credit for is his development of Rylo Ken/Ben Solo. Johnson and Adam Driver make the character's inner turmoil between whether to embrace the light or dark side of the force seem very real and honestly left me wondering which way he will go. In the prequel trilogy, we already knew Anakin was going to embrace the dark side, so there was no suspense there, and the original trilogy had Vader as an out-and-out black hat villain for the first two films with no hints of an inner struggle, so having the Vader figure of the new trilogy palpably struggling with what direction to go is compelling to watch. Daisy Ridley also gets a lot of credit for helping make Rylo Ken's struggle feel more human, but Ridley deserves recognition for the strength of her own character as well, with Rey holding her own with such an iconic of character as Luke Skywalker for much of the film. It's also worth noting Carrie Fisher's final film appearance as Leia was given additional weight by her recent passing in real life. There's also a surprising supporting role by Benicio Del Toro, who is terrific as always. I'm really hoping his character returns in the next film. SPOILER ALERT! Getting to see Luke and Leia reunite, even if it was ever so briefly, is a great little moment. The other spoiler worth noting is Yoda's appearance and how excited I was to have Yoda portrayed by a puppet once again and NOT computer generate imagery (along with again being voiced by the great Frank Oz). Overall, 'The Last Jedi' elevated the new trilogy and allowed it to stand on it's own. 'The Force Awakens' was the fanboy movie I was hoping to see with the prequel trilogy and made me excited about the Star Wars universe again. 'The Last Jedi' allowed the new trilogy to come into it's own and gave real substance to these new characters.",9,1,7,3 January 2018
The Evil Dead," The original Ash vs. Deadites
","Classic low budget horror film that I love and can no longer objectively review. Directorial debut of Sam Raimi ('Army of Darkness' 'A Simple Plan' 'Spider-Man'), film debut of cult favorite Bruce Campbell in his most iconic role as Ash Williams (although his Elvis in 'Bubba Ho-Tep' is my personal favorite), and the filmscore debut of prolific composer Joseph LoDuca ('Xena: Warrior Princess' 'Spartacus' 'Brotherhood of the Wolf'). The film was produced by Rob Tapert, who'd go on to produce many more films and TV shows with Raimi. Ash and his group of friends in their 73 Oldsmobile head to a remote cabin in the woods and inadvertently wake the evil dead when they read aloud from the Necrocomicon. Demonic possessions, evil trees, and all sorts of weirdness ensue. For such a low budget film, it's manages to to be visually inventive (particularly the evil spirit POV shots through the woods), shockingly gory (but in a fun over-the-top way), and also works wonderfully as a black comedy. 'Evil Dead 2' does feature better special effects and is much more consistent in tone, staying consistent as a dark horror comedy than this first film, which at times wants to be a straight horror film and at other times wants to be tongue-in-check, but those are minor quibbles for a film that's terrifically fun and wildly inventive. A must see for horror fans, but maybe not a film for all tastes.",10,3,7,17 September 2018
Saw II," Engaging, but lacking the mystery of the original
","Disappointing sequel to the surprisingly quality first film. 'Saw' had good plotting and a solid mystery, along with a lot of memorably grizzly horror. This sequel instead focuses primarily on the grizzly horror (the pit of dirty drug needles is by far the film's most memorable moment and unsettling) and really doesn't have much of a story outside of how-are-these-people-going-escape-Jigsaw's-deadly-traps? The film does offer one unexpected twist at the end, which led to several more sequels, but for the most part, this film set the formula for the many sequels, which was simply a new set of victims and anew set of overly elaborate traps. That was enough to hold my interest, but it's not really enough to call this a good horror film. Donnie Wahlberg, Beverley Mitchell, Shawnee Smith, Tobin Bell, Glenn Plummer, and Dina Meyer provide the solid cast.",5,1,1,21 June 2017
From Dusk Till Dawn," Reservoir Dogs vs. Mexican Vampires
","Incredibly fun genre mash-up from director Robert Rodriguez ('Desperado' 'The Faculty' 'Spy Kids') and screenwriter Quentin Tarantino ('Pulp Fiction' 'Kill Bill' 'Hateful Eight'). In what is best described as Reservoir Dogs vs. Mexican Vampires, a pair of low-life criminals, The Gecko Brothers, handsome leader George Clooney and creepy sex offender little brother Tarantino, are on the lamb and headed for Mexico when they kidnap Harvey Keitel and family, Juliette Lewis and her brother, to help them sneak across the border in their RV. One thing that makes this film so fun is that the first half is a pretty straight crime film, but it takes a hard genre turn towards horror when our heroes stop off at a seedy strip club to celebrate their successful border crossing, finding themselves in an establishment run by vampires intent on locking everyone inside and feast upon their blood. From there, the film turns from crime film into a 'Night of the Living Dead' or 'Assault on Precinct 13' style siege film (a nod to which is made by one character wearing a 'Precinct 13' t-shirt). I remember a friend of mine watching this film with no idea what it was about or there were any horror elements to the film and had his mind completely explode when the bar employees and strippers all of a sudden start turning into vampires, which I thought was hilarious since there is nothing in the first half of the film to indicate that vampires are coming. The second half of the film is pretty heavy on action and vampire slaying, so there's not as much snappy Tarantino dialogue, but is still fun non-the-less. There's also a very cool supporting cast of character that show up in the vampire club including Salma Hayek as a stripper named Santanico Pandemonium, Cheech Marin in three different roles, Danny Trejo as Razor Charlie, Tom Savini as sex Machine, Greg Nicotero, and the always great Fred Williamson. Some other memorable supporting players who appear prior to the vampire bar are John Saxon, Marc Lawrence, Kelly Preston, John Hawkes, and Michael Parks. There's also some fun crossovers moments to other Tarantino and Rodriguez films including Michael Park's Earl McGraw later becoming a recurring character in 'Kill Bill,' 'Planet Terror,' and 'Death Proof'. There's also Chango Beer and Sex Machine's codpiece gun that reference 'Desperado.' Big Kahuna Burgers from 'Pulp Fiction' also make an appearance and would later reappear in 'Death Proof.' Clooney also borrows a line from 'Reservoir Dogs' with 'All right, Ramblers. Let's get ramblin'!' Oh, and Tarantino's trademark foot fetish is also present. So for fans of Rodrigues and Tarantino movies, this one is hard to resist. For non-fans, you may not love it as much, but it's still goofy crime and horror film fun. FUN FACT! In return for providing the ear-slicing scene special effects in Reservoir Dogs, Robert Kurtzman asked Tarantino to write the screenplay for 'From Dusk Till Dawn' based on his original story.",8,0,0,1 August 2019
Mission: Impossible II," John Woo leaves his stamp on his one Mission: Impossible film
","I remember after seeing this film being very excited about what I though was going to be a unique action series where each installment would be directed by a distinctly different director who would leave their own unique stamp on the series. The first film was directed by master of suspense Brian De Palma and this first sequel in the series was directed by John Woo, the most famous of the Hong Kong action directors, who brings his 'heroic bloodshed' type of story and action to this mega budget Hollywood production. Woo's best films, or at least his best known films, are 'The Killer' and 'Hard-Boiled,' both stories about two men on opposite sides of the law, but who in many ways live parallel lives. The story here has echos of that sort of mano a mano battle between two ying and yang type of characters, but not to the extend as Woo's Hong Kong pictures. Now I'm writing this review couple weeks after having watched the film and I'm barley remembering the story, which kind of makes sense since according to co-writer Robert Towne (Star Trek writers Ronald D. Moore & Brannon Braga received story credit) said that much of the script was written around action scenes that Woo told him he wanted to be able to direct for the movie. What I do remember of the story is that Dougray Scott is the bad guy who has some sort of deadly bioengineered disease and it's up to Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton to stop him. Although it's not all that memorable of a story, and this was reportedly a conscious decision by the filmmakers due to the criticism of the first film received regarding it's overly complicated plot (which it was), but what is memorable about MI2 are Woo's directorial stylistics. All of his usual trademarks are presents; zooms, slow motion, people firing two guns, birds flying in slow motion, etc. and although the action is not nearly as wild as anything in 'A Better Tomorrow Part II' or 'Bullet to the Head,' it's unmistakably a John Woo action scene. I remember being disappointed in the action at the time, but rewatching it now, I can appreciate all that Woo did bring to the film. Woo also brings a number of memorable non-gunplay sequences, including a car chase between Cruise and Newton early in the film, which plays out more like a dance than a William Friedkin or Walter Hill style of car chase, or the climactic fight between Cruise and Scott on as rocky seashore that's a wonderfully loopy genre mash-up; part Hong Kong heroic bloodshed, part spaghetti western, and part straight-up American fight scene. Woo's first cut of the film came in at three and a half hours, which is obviously not the film that was released, but how fun would it have been to see that director's cut of an epic length John Woo film with all the budget and trappings of a major Hollywood studio allowing him to indulge in slow motion tracking shots of big name stars in their sunglasses, or close-ups of clothings, or birds, or whatever else Woo felt needed to be added to build his sense of atmosphere and cool? The movie was also originally given a R-rating and had to have the violence edited down to a PG-13, which is another reason it would be fun to see Woo's three and a half hour crazy violent version of this film. And interestingly, Woo was not the first choice of director on this film. Cruise originally offered the job to De Palma, but he declined. The job then went to Oliver Stone, who if you remember has not always done heady dramas, but wrote come classic action films including De Palma's 'Scarface' and Hal Ashby's 'Eight Million Ways to Die' but Stone had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts when Cruise's ended up having to work an extended amount of time on 'Eyes Wide Shut,' directed by Stanley Kubrick, who was notorious for the length of his shoots. Overall, MI2 is absolutely a John Woo films, even if it's a bit watered down for mainstream audiences compared to his Hong Kong films, and although 'Face/Off' is still Woo's best American production, MI2 is a solid credit to Woo's filmography and I would argue is better than 'Broken Arrow.' (I'm not mentioning 'Hard Target' because I have a pretty big soft spot for that film and it may be my favorite of Woo's American films, even if I can't quantify an argument as to why it's a better film - maybe it was Wilford Brimley riding a horse in slow motion.).",7,0,0,25 June 2018
Black Snake Moan," Two great leads can't save cliché filled tripe
","'Black Snake Moan' drips in atmosphere, but it's clichéd, meandering, and mostly offensive. Samuel L. Jackson plays a Tennessee blues man looking for redemption and find his chance by 'helping' stereotypical white trash Christina Ricci. After finding a drunken, half-naked, and beat up Ricci along the roadside, he chains her to his radiator in order to provide tough love until she agrees to change her party girl ways. Yep, the film is just that offensive! Jackson and Ricci are both strong actors and are compulsively watchable, even when they're saddled with garbage like this, but it's only their screen presence that makes this film barely watchable.",4,1,3,10 December 2017
Grindhouse," One of Rodriguez's best and one of Tarantino's weakest is still great
","I originally saw this in the theater and loved it! I was too young to have seen this sort of double feature this film is a loving homage to, but I did grow up watching a ton of these sorts of exploitation films on VHS, which re-watching this film brought back those video store memories. Maybe for a home video release of this double feature they should have added some cheesy Vestron Video opening and replaced the missing reels and burnouts with VHS tape splices and tracking errors. Or maybe that's another Rodriguez/Tarantino film for another day? I'd recently watched both of these films separately and gave 'Planet Terror' ***** and 'Death Proof' ***1/2. 'Gindhouse' in it's original theatrical presentation as a double feature, complete with mock trailers for fictional movies, falls somewhere in between. Edgar Wright's 'Don't' trailer is the best. It looks most like it was a real movie and has a hilariously coda at the end, but a close runner-up is Eli Roth's 'Thanksgiving' as a very funny send up of holiday themed slasher films (i.e. 'Halloween,' 'Mother's Day,' 'April Fool's Day,' 'Black Christmas,' etc), but Rodriguez's 'Machete' trailer and Rob Zombie's 'Werewolf Women of the SS' are also hilarious send ups of various exploitation film sub-genres. I also greatly appreciated the faux grain in the 'Grindhouse' version over the cleaned up individual releases. As to the merits of the two films on their own, see my previous individual reviews.",9,0,0,21 October 2017
Mission: Impossible," De Palma set pieces overcome an overcome an overly complicated plot and an annoying lead actor
","This first Mission: Impossible film is a bit of a mixed bag for me. Firstly, Tom Cruise has always annoyed me as an actor, although I usually end up finding myself enjoying his films despite his annoying screen presence and weirdly intense performances. Second, This film's serpentine and overly complicated plot more than pushed credulity, not that your typical James Bond film is exactly realistic, but the plot here takes so many twists that it just becomes annoying. However, there are enough other aspect to the film that are so good the above mentioned fairly major deficits are overcome. The film opens with the IMF team (Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Béart, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ingeborga Dapkunaite, and Emilio Estevez) infiltrating a foreign embassy, when (SPOILER ALERT) the entire team is killed, which was a shockingly awesome the first time I saw it in the theater (especially after each character got their own freeze frame intro ALA TV credit sequence), with only Cruise and Béart barely escaping with their lives. The two then become prime suspects in their team's demise and then set out to clear their name by stealing the 'NOC List' which contains all of the undercover IMF agents, which they will then use as leverage with another power broker so, blah, blah, blah... who really cares. The NOC List is a classic MacGuffin where it doesn't really matter what it is, except that all of the characters are after it. Cruise forms his own rogue team of disavowed agents, and I still remember the audible gasp of excitement from the audience in the theater with the reveal of Ving Rhames leaning into frame, followed by Jean Reno leaning in right after him. The two were not major stars at the time, but had both just come off of 'Pulp Fiction' and 'The Professional,' which is something that may be lost on audiences watching this film today. The main charm of this first Mission: Impossible film is the set pieces, which is something right up director Brian De Palma's alley. De Palma is famous for his elaborate set pieces, whether it's the baby carriage bouncing down the steps in the midsts of a slow motion shootout in 'The Untouchables,' Angie Dickinson in 'Dressed to Kill' following a man through an art gallery, John Travolta in 'Blow Out' using a radio mic to find Nancy Allen before John Lithgow kills her, the long Steadicam setups for finale of 'Carlito's Way,' or the wildly suspenseful build up to the pigs blood being dropped on Carrie at her prom, he is a director deservedly known as a modern day master of suspense and the rightful hair to Hitchcock's throne. De Palma delivers multiple set pieces, but the best comes in the middle of the film when the team breaks into the CIA headquarters, lasting almost 20 minutes, done almost wordlessly, and in near complete silence. The team breaks into a secure room at Langley that only one man has access to, is sound sensitive, the floors pressure sensitive, and are temperature sensitive, all of which can trigger an alarm, so the team has to get gain access, get the one agent out of the room, and bypass all the alarms in order to steal the NOC List. Will the agent come back into the room to discover Hunt? Will Hunt touch the floor and set off the alarm? Will the temperature in the room rise too high and set off the alarm? Will a noise set off the alarm? Will Reno be able to hold rope long enough to keep Hunt aloft? Will a rat in the air duct cause Reno to drop Hunt? Will that bead of sweat on Hunt's glasses touch the floor and set off the alarm? It's an insanely fun suspense set piece and is irresistible. The scene reminded me of the great Jules Dassin jewel heist pictures like 'Rififi' or 'Topkapi,' but with a dash of James Bond. The other scene that always stuck with me is a smaller one, but it's is also a testament to De Palma's directors skills. It's a scene following the film's opening when Cruise goes to a rrestaurant with the CIA director who wants to take Cruise in for questioning about his failed mission. De Palma slowly builds the suspense with increasing close ups of the two actors starring each other down as CIA head Eugene Kittridge, played by the underrated Henry Czerny, as he delivers the sharply written Robert Towne dialogue, over the crescendoing Danny Elman score, saying'Alright, Hunt. Enough is enough. You have bribed, cajoled and killed, and you have done it using loyalties on the inside, you want to shake hands with the devil, that's fine with me, I just want to make sure you do it in hell.'And then BOOM! Fish tanks explode and Elfman's music soars in what's another great De Palma build-up and climax. But De Palma films are much more than suspense. He's also known for his themes around voyeurism, violence, and guilt, as well as his many visual hallmarks, including split-screen, slow zooms, 360 degree shots, and extensive use of POV shots, all of which manage to work their way into 'Mission: Impossible.' Thematically, it's nowhere as hard edged as 'Casualties of War' or 'Body Double' but this is unmistakably a Brian De Palma film and he leaves his fingerprints all over it. The second Mission: Impossible film had a very different kind of action film director with John Woo, who also left his very unique style of action on that film, which made me quite excited about this franchise, where each film would feature a different director who's bring their own unique vision to the series. The subsequent sequels directed by J.J. Abrams, Brad Bird, and Christopher McQuarrie (all good films and all good directors) did not stand apart from one another nearly as much as Woo and De Palma's films did. I think it would have been fun to have continued to seek diverse action film directors to tackle each new films. Who wouldn't want to see Luc Besson, Walter Hill, John Milius, James Cameron, or Michael Mann directed a Mission: Impossible sequel, though they may be too big for a franchise films, but still, a sequel directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, Gareth Evans, Kathryn Bigelow, Matthew Vaughn, Takashi Miike, or Edgar Wright seems completely plausible and super exciting. But I digress. Overall, the first Mission: Impossible film features is pretty excellent despite an overly complicated plot and an annoying lead actor, making up for it's faults with solid action, a strong cast (minus Cruise), crisp dialog, and an iconic suspense set piece smack dab in the middle of the film.",8,0,1,29 May 2018
Saw," First Saw is a smart horror/thriller. Sequels just torture porn.
","The quality of this series seriously declined as time went on, but this first film really does stand apart as being smarter and not simply a torture porn gore-fest. Similar to 'The Cube,' this film has a can't resist premise of two men (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell) waking up in a dank disgusting basement, chained to the wall, with a dead body between them, and no idea how they got there or how to get out. This film, unlike the others, unfolds much more like a mystery, as the two men flashback to the events leading up to their imprisonment, while at the same time a team of police detectives (Danny Glover and Ken Leung) are hot on the trail of the madman who put them there. Even without the elaborate head-smashing traps and terrible choices, this would have been an exciting thriller. In some ways, the sensationalistic traps and terrible choices detract from the film, although I think it was those elements that really hooked audiences (that was the focus the the film's marketing at the time), but this entire film could have worked fine without that. However, the sequels seemed to almost exclusively focus on those extreme elements and the mystery and thriller elements took a backseat, which is why the subsequent films are nowhere as good as the first. This first film also stands out because it has a stronger cast than any of the sequels, which also includes Dina Meyer, Michael Emerson, Shawnee Smith, Monica Potter, and Tobin Bell as Jigsaw. Although this film is clearly going to be repellent for most audiences, it's undeniably compelling if you are a horror fan and can stomach the many stomach churning moments in the film. Overall, this film isn't a classic, but it is something of a cultural touchstone for when torture porn had it's short lived and ignominious run ('Hostel' is still the best American film of this disreputable genre).",7,0,1,18 June 2017
Super 8," Before 'Stranger Things,' J.J. Abrams did his own 80s/Spielberg love letter
","Before 'Stranger Things' was ever a thing, J.J. Abrams did his own love letter to early Steven Spielberg, a nostalgic and spot-on homage to films such as 'E.T.,' 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' or 'Poltergeist.' Sure Tobe Hooper directed the last one, but Spielberg produced and left his mark all over it and the horror elements of that film are embraced in 'Super 8'. Spielberg also produced 'Super 8' and it contains many early Spieberg-ian hallmarks; childhood innocence, broken families, government conspiracies, the sense of wonder and faith, parent-child relationships, etc. Set in the summer of 1979, a group of middle school boys and one girl are filming their super 8 zombie movie when they unexpectedly film a train crash transporting a secret cargo. To reveal more would spoil the plot, but the plot isn't what make 'Super 8' memorable. Just like the best Spielberg films, it's the characters and their relationships that have endeared those film to us and made them classics. 'Poltergeist' is a perfect example of this. The plot is a fairly straightforward haunted house story that is basically a riff on 'The Twilight Zone' episode 'Little Girl Lost,' but the believability of the characters and the realistic portrait of a typical suburban family connect the audience so much more to the plot (and the scares) than would a similar haunted house story with lesser defined of characters. Even strong haunted house films like 'The Entity' or 'House by the Cemetery' are nowhere as immediately identifiable to audiences as the family depicted in 'Poltergeist,' which has the impact of making the scares all the more scary. 'Super 8' manages to capture that same type of middle America feel, but does so steeped in nostalgia, in very much the same way the Duffer Brothers have done with 'Stranger Things.' Now despite the well drawn characters and the warm nostalgia the film generates, the story about the mysterious cargo on the train and the kids investigation is nowhere as interesting or compelling as Spielberg's best films. 'Super 8' is probably on the same level as 'Explorers' when it comes to story, which isn't bad, but the plot is just not up to ET or Close Encounters levels of greatness. Back to the film's strengths, it boasts a strong cast of unknown child actors, with the exception of Elle Fanning who I think at the time was more famous because of her sister, Dakota. The always reliable Kyle Chandler is also a standout as a deputy sheriff looking into the train crash against his superior's wishes and who's also the father of the main boy of the group, both who are grieving the recent loss of the boy's mother. Also of note is a fine score by composer Michael Giacchino, which manages to be nicely evocative of the John Williams/Jerry Goldsmith type of scores that frequently accompanied Spielberg films of this era. Overall, J.J. Abrams does a terrific job of capturing the innocence and wonder of early Steven Spielberg, which is a real treat for anyone who grew up watching these film.",8,4,6,8 April 2018
Reservoir Dogs," Taratino's debut still holds up as a classic crime film
","I remember walking out of the theater after seeing this film the first time and telling my friend, 'If I ever make a movie, I'd want it to be something like this!' Quentin Tarantino's movie obsessed personality completely clicks for me, with a fondness for exploitation and genre cinema, but balanced with a respect and understanding of classic and foreign cinema. 'Reservoir Dogs' offers a perfect cocktail mix of pulp and art, equal parts Don Siegel and Joseph H. Lewis, but also equal parts Jean-Pierre Melville and David Mamet. The story is a straightforward heist film, but what Tarantino does differently is how he structures his story. Fro one, he never shows the actual heist and a majority of the film is the events following the failed heist, with flashbacks to events prior to said heist. Flackbacks have become a trademark of Tarantino's, but he uses them in a way that serves the story, providing necessary information for the audience at a specific time. Another major departure from standard heist films is Tarantino's dialogue, which is amazingly sharp and fun to listen to. No one write like he does, though he has plenty of imitators who've attempted to mimic his voice, it's a kind of artificial movie-speak that will either delight or annoy filmgoers. When you top all that off with an amazing cast, that includes Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Tim Roth, and classic film heavy Lawrence Tierney, it's hard to imaging this film going far wrong. Of special note, Madsen especially gives good in a can't-take-your-eyes-off-of-him performance as the psychotic Mr. Blond. Much like Anthony Perkins' performance in 'Psycho,' this role for Madsen pretty much typecast him as a smiling villain for much of his career. Tarantino has been called out for copying much of the plot of Ringo Lam's Hong Kong action film 'City on Fire.' Without revealing any spoilers, the story is undeniably similar, right down to some very specific scenes. However, as good a film as 'City on Fire' is, 'Reservoir Dogs' is soooo much better. Tarantino clearly lifted many story elements from that film, but he used them to make a much stronger film. Re-watching this film now, another fun element is you get to watch Tarantino's cinematic universe begins to take shape, with character being potentially related to or appearing to other Tarantino stories, with the names Alabama ('True Romance'), Vega ('Pulp Fiction'), Skagnetti ('Natural Born Killers'), Marvin Nash ('Natural Born Killers' and 'Pulp Fiction') all getting mentioned at one point or another. But as I wrote at the top of this review, Tarantino completely has my number and his sensibilities seem perfectly in sync with my own, which is probably why I see 'Reservoir Dogs' as a true cinematic classic.",10,0,0,15 October 2017
Don't Breathe," Durable home invasions plot serves as a showcase for director Fede Alvarez
","A trio of burglars, Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, and Daniel Zovatto, break into a blind veteran's remote home, the great Stephen Lang, to steal a recent large legal settlement. The young burglars get more than they planned for when they instead find themselves the trapped inside the home and stalked by Lange. The fact that Lang's character cannot see and the burglars cannot speak for fear he'll hear them and kill them makes it so a majority of the films done wordlessly and in complete silence. These sorts of movie set-ups are what I consider 'pure cinema,' telling a story on film that could not be told in another medium. Not as a book not as a comic, not as a play, or not in any other storytelling format. 'Don't Breathe' builds suspense with visuals and sound in a way that would not transfer to another medium. Now the set-up is not all that clever or original (I supposed you could say it's 'Wait Until Dark' turned on it's head), but director Fede Alvarez, who'd previously directed the surprisingly strong 'Evil Dead' remake, builds tension like a master and has crafted a wicked little suspense thriller. In contrast to his 'Evil Dead' remake, this film steers away from blood and gore and instead focuses on suspense, creating a situation where the audience can't help but ask themselves, what would they do in this situation? Credit for this also goes to a strong script co-written by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues, which the best of these sorts of films have the characters have the characters take the logical actions the audience would do in that same situation. It's like the classic haunted house story question. Why don't the characters just leave? The script for 'Don't Breath' does a great job of exhausting all of the logical options you'd think the burglars would do to try to escape (cell phones, guns, windows, door locks, basement exits, etc.). The story does seem to overly rely on horror movie tropes than I would have liked (torture, the-last-girl, night vision, etc..), but it's all done so well that horror movie aficionados won't care. Produced by Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert, with an fine score by Roque BaÃ±os, 'Don't Breath' is a must see for horror fans!",8,0,1,3 June 2018
The Untouchables," De Palma and Mamet craft a brilliant gangster picture with modern day sensibilities.
","A commercial and artistic high point for director Brian De Palma ('Blow Out' 'Dressed to Kill' 'Scarface' 'Femme Fatale'), working from a script by David Mamet ('House of Games' 'Glengarry Glen Ross' 'Heist' etc.) and featuring Kevin Costner in his breakout star making performance as prohibition era crime fighter Eliot Ness. There's little historical accuracy to the film, but who really cares about that when there is so many other things to love about the film. Besides the above mentioned assets, you have an incredibly strong cast led by Coster as an idealistic Ness, who's joined by honest beat cop Jim Malone, a wonderfully over-the-hill Sean Connery, a rookie cop recruited straight from the Academy who hasn't been corrupted yet ('If you're afraid of getting a rotten apple, don't go to the barrel. Get it off the tree.') played by a young Andy Garcia ('8 Million Ways to Die' was his only other major credit before this), and capped off by Robert De Niro packing on a ton of weight to play Chicago gangster Al Capone. Incidentally, De Niro started his career with director Brian De Palma well before he made 'Mean Streets' with Martin Scorsese, so it's a treat to see the two reunite. Besides the strong leads, you also have Charles Martin Smith, Richard Bradford, Billy Drago, Patricia Clarkson, Del Close, and even Clifton James (the tobacco chewing sheriff from 'Man with the Golden Gun' and 'Live and Let Die') all in memorable parts, so it really is a cast to die for. In addition to a sharp script, an amazing cast, you have some serious talent behind the camera that includes cinematographer Stephen H. Burum ('Rumble Fish' 'Carlito's Way' 'Hoffa'), composer Ennio Morricone ('The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' 'The Mission' 'The Hateful Eight'), set decoration by the guy who's everything from Disney's 'Mary Poppins' to 'Back to the Future,' and the editor of 'The French Connection' 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Scarface,' but the real hero behind the camera is director Brian De Palma. The sets, costumes, music, and overall period atmosphere are amazing, but it's the visual stylistics from De Palma that make this film a classic. Without spoiling anything, the Pagliacci scene and the Sergei Eisenstein inspired baby carriage scene are moments of pure cinema (meaning they are scenes that would be impossible to capture or recreate as effectively in another medium. Not written word, not painting, not stage play, not graphic novel, etc.). Although a major studio film, this is unmistakably a Brian De Palma picture. 'The Untouchables' is minus his usual obsessions around voyeurism and sexuality, but the film does have his trademark fascination with violence ('They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the Chicago way!'), guilt/betrayal (most all of the characters are motivated by some form of guilt), as well as his many visual hallmarks (camera zooms, slow motion, and memorable POV shots). De Palma's fingerprints are all over the film, especially the 'Battleship Potemkin' inspired train station shootout with a baby carriage bouncing down marble steps amongst a hail of slow motion gunfire. According to Mamet, the scene was not in the original script and was added by De Palma, but this particular scene ends up being the most memorable of the film. It's De Palma's signature suspenseful build-up that makes the scene so effective. In lesser hands, this 10-minute sequence might have been a straight forward shootout, but with De Palma it achieves operatic levels, with about a dozen moving parts all contributing to mounting suspense as he turns the screws on the audience, stretching out about 10 seconds of real time action into a two minute slow motion action masterpiece. Whether it's a bucket of pigs blood above Carrie's head or Tom Cruise trying to catch a bead of sweat, De Palma builds suspense better almost anyone. What makes 'The Untouchables' different from many of his other films is its emotional center, which comes from an earnest performance by Coster and Mamet's carefully plotted script. Many of De Palma's films seem at times mere exercises in cinematic stylistics and explorations of his various obsessions, but his best films have an emotional center, which I would say are 'Carrie,' 'Blow Out,' 'Casualties of War,' 'Carlito's Way,' and this film. Overall, from the the stylish opening credits to the soaring finale, 'The Untouchables' doesn't have a single false note. This is the film that De Palma will be remembered for and deserves to be recognized as a true American film classic. SIDE NOTE: Rewatching the film 2018, I was struck by how '1980' this otherwise very authentic looking period film seemed. I had a hard time putting my finger on what made it seem such a product of it's time, but I think it came down to the cinematography, with the use of hazy lighting, but still, I'm not quite sure what made this period picture seem so 80s.",10,2,3,24 December 2018
Zombieland," Post-apocalyptic zombie comedy is charming, gory, and nearly stolen by a hilarious cameo
","I remember loving this film when it first same out, but it didn't hold up quite as well upon rewatching it. It's still good, but zombie films are pretty played out and the film doesn't offer anything unique except for some decent comedy. Co-writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick would go on to write the highly successful 'Deadpool,' which I actually haven't seen but hear took the highly played out superhero film and reinvigorated it by bringing self referential humor while also delivering loads of ultra-violence. Wes Craven's 'Scream' did the same thing when slasher films were becoming very routine and very played out. When 'Zombieland' came out, zombies were not quite to the point where the living dead had become tiresome, so the film's adherence to the conventions of this horror sub-genre were perfectly acceptable, especially since they were executed with style, with an A-list cast (Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin), and with better production values than it's lower budgeted contemporaries. However, watching the film now, it's unoriginal take on the zombie film sub-genre feels pretty tired this time around. This film was a major studio production of what's usually a B-level budgeted genre film. The story, such as it is, is basically a road movie with some dueling comedic duos. The main pair is Eisenberg and Harrelson. Eisenberg is the relatable everyman. He's who we all would actually be during a zombie apocalypse. Harrelson, on the other hand, is complete id, and is who anyone who's ever ruminated about what they'd be like during a zombie apocalypse imagined themselves as being. Harrelson is supremely confident and macho, driving big trucks, carrying big guns, and blowing stuff up real good. These two are repeatedly outwitted by con artist sisters Stone and Breslin, who leave them high and dry on multiple occasions, that is until the two reach an uneasy alliance on a quest to drive across the country in hopes of reaching a zombie-free amusement park in California. In the film's favor, the film is populated with four entertaining and likable lead characters. Also, the road trip premiss allows for an entertaining series of episodic events. The film also benefits form it's studio support, which allows for better special effects, a better cast, a more talented of director in Ruben Fleischer, and an overall a bigger scale and better production for their version of a zombie apocalypse. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the film, but there's a hilarious cameo that on it's own earns 'Zombieland' an extra star in it's rating. On the downside, I did not care for the frequent breaking of the third wall, where Eisenberg directly talks to the audience, or when the film makes a random cutaway to the 'Zombie Kill of the Week.' Also, the film doesn't present any zombie scenarios that seem all that original or interesting, which wasn't all that bad when this film came out because there hand't been quite as many quality living dead films at this point in time, so anything well produced was exciting and good, but now that we live in an oversaturate undead media environment, you need something original like 'Dead Set' or 'The Cured' or the long-form storytelling of 'The Walking Dead' to stand apart from what's become pretty familiar stories and scenarios. Still, despite the film's seeming unoriginality in story and situations, the actors and characters are quite likable, the film's comedy for the most part works, and the better than average production values make this zombie film well worth watching.",7,0,0,15 July 2018
The Witch," Chilling slow burn horror chamber piece carefully balances psychological and supernatural horror
","Set in 1630s New England, a family that's been shunner by their community over a religious dispute is forced to move far into the forest on their own. The film is told from the perspective of the eldest daughter, Anya Taylor-Joy in a standout performance that's also her film debut, one day is watching her baby brother who mysteriously disappears before her very eyes. It's revealed that a witch has stolen the unbaptized child for a blood sacrifice. At that point, the family begins to suspect one another of consorting with the devil and practicing witchcraft, which is where things begin to unravel. First time writer/director Robert Eggers has made something of a minor masterpiece with this slow burn horror film that never quite comes out to explicitly state whether anything supernatural is happening or if it's all in the paranoia imaginations of it's characters. This isn't to say the film isn't scary, because it's scary as hell. Although not a standard jump-scare horror film in manner of 'The Conjuring' or 'Paranormal Activity,' Eggers delights in slowly building tension between characters and peppering it with some truly haunting and chilling imagery. When Taylor-Joy's younger twin siblings befriend a goat named Black Phillip, hold onto your horses! There are few films I would visually compare this too (Dante Tomaselli is possibly the only current horror filmmaker I might compare Eggers visual style of horror). It's shot primary using natural lighting and the camera is largely invisible in that it doesn't draw attention to itself with showy pans or zooms. It's primarily frightening and chilling static images that stick with you, whether it's Black Phillip striding through the forest, a red cloaked raven haired beauty becoming the viewer closer, or some of the more overt horror images I won't spoil here which may or may not be hallucinations or dreams. Eggers has stated the film is based on folktales, fairytales and written accounts of historical witchcraft, including journals, diaries, and court records, with much of the dialogue coming directly from these primary sources, which gives the film a sense of authenticity that's missing from many period films about witchcraft. Witches have long been a horror film staple, but they rarely come off well. 'Rosemary's Baby' is likely the best film about witches and like this film, it rode a delicate balance between supernatural and psychological, but no film about witches has better captured the folktale/folklore elements of witchcraft than 'The Witch.' The silent film 'Häxan' may be the only other film I can think of that possibly captures this period feel, but that silent film documentary style was quite different from a narrative form of storytelling. In 'The Witch,' the imagery of a black goat with a broken horn, all the talk of 'signing the book,' different animals which may or may not be familiars, talk of a witch's teat, or the plot point around an unbaptized child all feel straight out folklore and effectively tap into primal audience fears. The film also greatly benefits from a truly remarkable score by composer Mark Korven, who creates an unsettling dissonant soundtrack using a minimalist approach. Korven actually built his own original instruments to create some of the frightening and original sounds used for the film's score, which makes the soundtrack to 'The Witch' one of my most favorite film scores in years. Overall, 'The Witch' is not a standard horror film that will appeal to your average Fangoria gore-hound, but is more of an arthouse horror film for horror fans who appreciate a slow burn horror style of filmmaking that takes its time to build character and tension.",9,4,6,13 November 2018
Scream 2," More of the same self-relative horror, enjoyably balances mock and slasher film goods
","Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson re-teamed for this unneeded but entertaining sequel. Also returning is a majority of the original cast (Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, and Liev Schreiber), where the story picks up two years later with Campbell attending college when a new killer dons the Ghostface mask and stalks her and her college pals. As with the first film, everyone is a suspect and most importantly the film strikes a nice tonal balance of mocking slasher film conventions while also delivering the slasher film goods. Jamie Kennedy's video store clerk, now a film school student, at one point explains the rules for horror sequels, stating 'there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to create a successful sequel. Number one: the body count is always bigger. Number two: the death scenes are always much more elaborate - more blood, more gore - *carnage candy*. And number three: never, ever, under any circumstances, assume the killer is dead.' and 'Scream 2' delivers on all three of these points. Besides meeting those sequel requirements, Craven is a master of suspense and shock and as with the first film, for a mainstream picture, he does deliver a shockingly rough horror film. Craven actually had to submit eight different cuts to the MPAA before getting an R-rating, so there's no mistaking that this film was from the same guy who made 'The Last House on the Left' and 'The Hills Have Eyes.' The film is also immensely helped by a strong cast of new characters that include Jada Pinkett, Omar Epps, Sarah Michelle Gellar (interestingly playing a helpless blond character-type, the antithesis of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which she was playing at this same time), Timothy Olyphant, Jerry O'Connell, Laurie Metcalf, Rebecca Gayheart, an unrecognizable Portia de Rossi, and the great David Warner in a small role as a drama teacher. Best of all are the very funny cameos for the movie-within-a-movie 'Stab,' where Heather Graham plays the Drew Barrymore part form the first film and Tori Spelling & Luke Wilson play Campbell and Skeet Ulrich's parts (an inside joke from the first film where one of Campbell's friends asks her 'If they make a movie about you, who's gonna play you?' and she answers, 'With my luck, they'd cast Tori Spelling.'). Look fast for a before-he-was-famous Adam Shankman as a Ghost Dancer and Selma Blair has an uncredited appearance (or is heard) as Gellar's friend on the phone. Also, the film was edited by Patrick Lussier, who'd later go on to direct the solid 'My Bloody Valentine' remake, Nic Cage's 'Drive Angry,' and was co-writer on under appreciated Terminator sequel 'Terminator Genisys.' My main complaint about the film is that Williamson's script hasn't aged all that well, seeming at bit too clever for itself, reminding me in many ways of the endless Tarantino wannabes of this era, where pop culture references were lazy substitutes for good dialogue, interesting characters, or original stories. Still, while this sequel basically covers the same ground of the first film, it's a strong cast with a talented director making a big budget slasher film, which is not something horror fans are treated to very often. FUN FACT! Robert Rodriguez ('Desperado' 'Sin City' 'Machete') directed scenes of 'Stab', the movie-within-a-movie.",7,4,4,30 December 2018
Jaws," Greatest nature-gone-wild film of all-time!
","Steven Spielberg's classic film about a giant shark terrorizing a small New England resort community is masterful entertainment and also (along with 'Star Wars') ushered in the age of the blockbuster film, essentially ending major studio support of smaller edgier films of the 1960s and 70s. I recently listened to an interview with Roger Corman, the prolific low budget exploration filmmaker, who noted that after he saw 'Jaws' he said to himself that he's in trouble because the majors figured out what he'd know for years, in terms of what audiences wanted to see, and did it much better. An argument could pretty easily be made that this is the greatest nature-gone- wild movie ever made. 'Jaws' truly is a great film, but when most of it's competition was the the likes of 'Frogs' (about a deadly hoards of frogs) or 'Them' (about giant radioactive ants) or 'Night of the Lepus' (about giant killer rabbits), it shouldn't be much of a surprise 'Jaws' wins out (okay, Hitchcock's 'The Birds' is a pretty excellent nature-gone-wild film, but 'Jaws' is still better). But back to 'Jaws,' this is the film that put Spielberg on the map. Up to this point he'd mostly done television and had one film under his belt, the fine 'Sugarland Express,' but 'Jaws' is a popcorn movie of the first order. Roy Scheider is the Chief of Police for the sleepy beach community of Amity Island when he's confronted with a likely shark attack at the outset of tourist season. Murray Hamilton is great in a supporting role as the mayor who won't let Chief Brody shut down the beaches, that is until a horrific attack in front of legions of beachgoers. At that point Brody is authorized to enlist the help of young shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and crusty shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw). Brody, Hooper, and Quint are a wonderful trio of contrasts aboard Quint's ship as they hunt the giant great white shark. One early exchange between Hooper and Quint quickly sums up their relationship:Quint: You have city hands, Mr. Hooper. You been countin' money all your life. Hooper: All right, all right. Hey, I don't need this... I don't need this working-class-hero crap.And you have Brody, who lives on an island but doesn't ever go in the water, playing the level headed one of the trio who wants to be anywhere but on a boat. The character dynamics between the three are terrific fun to watch and lead to many memorable scenes and quips ('You're gonna need a bigger boat.' or 'Cage goes in the water, you go in the water. Shark's in the water.' or 'Slow ahead. I can go slow ahead. Come on down here and chum some of this sh-t.' or 'I'm not going to waste my time arguing with a man who's lining up to be a hot lunch.' and then there's the USS Indianapolis speech. Quint's tale (and character motivation) is a perfect marriage of acting, writing, and direction and is likely my favorite scene of the film. Robert Shaw is absolutely riveting as he tells his tale of his WWII naval vessel going down after being hit by Japanese submarine torpedoes and the men having to survive for days in the water as sharks preyed upon them. 'I'll never put on a life jacket again.' There's been much discussion as to who wrote this scene, but according to Spielberg it was first written by playwright Howard Sackler, who wrote about three quarters of a page, and was then expanded by the great John Milius to about ten pages of dialogue, and lastly Shaw himself pared down Milius' work to what appears in the film. This has to be one of the all-time greatest moments committed to film. But the suspense Spielberg builds towards the end as the ship is slowing sinking while the three men struggle to figure out how to kill the shark and/or how to survive. The way the camera bobs up and down with the waves and how the camera gets lower and lower into the water as the boat slowly sinks is extremely effective in immersing the audience in the situation, especially if you've seen this film in a darkened theater on the big screen, where you nearly feel Brody's sea sickness, not to mention his terror as the shark gets closer and closer. But as fun this film is as a roller-coaster thrill ride, you also can't forget the quieter moments, such as the dinner table scene where Brody and his son silently mimic each other, which audiences would later realize is a moment of pure Spielberg. Or the smaller comic moments early in the film with Broday taking reports of kids from the karate class 'karate chopping' the fences, perfectly establishing Chief Brody's usual police activities. Even these small moments all serve a purpose and there is not a wasted moment. Additional, no one could review this film without acknowledging the contribution of John Williams' iconic score. After watching the film I listen to Williams' score and found his heavy use of strings and even some of the themes very similar to Bernard Herrmann's score for 'Psycho.' Overall, this film is an American film classic and is a must see for all audiences.",10,2,4,6 July 2017
Kingpin," The crass breakout Farrelly Brothers comedy still holds up
","I saw this back in the day in the theater at a midnight showing and loved it. 'Kingpin' was a box office disappointment upon it's original release, but it found it's audience on home video and became something of a cult classic. The set-up is basically 'The Natural' except instead of a 1920s Robert Redford having his baseball career cut short, we have a 1970s Woody Harrelson's promising professional bowling career cut short. Harrelson resurfaces 20 something years later to mentor an Amish bowling prospect, Randy Quaid, in order to get payback against bowling star Bill Murray, who was responsible for Harrelson's career ending bowling injury. Suffice to say, it's not the story that made this film memorable. It's the many over-the-top hilarious gags and some surprisingly earnest characters that make this film still hold up today. Some of he best gags involve Harrelson's rubber hand, the foul mouthed Lin Shaye, Harrelson trying to pass as Amish, Quade getting some cold drinks, and an odd Indecent Proposal sequence involving a cameo by Chris Elliott, but it's really Bill Murray who steal every scene that he's in, whether he's mugging after losing a bowling match, doing a self serving infomercial, or something as small as his bad hair combover, he is absolutely hilarious in what might arguable be his best comedic performance (and that's saying something). It's really too bad Murray's part is a supporting role, but it may be his limited screen time that makes his performance so special. Writer/directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly had previously made the popular (and I believe critically underrated) 'Dumb and Dumber,' but it was this film that helped pave the way for the slew of raunchy 90s comedies that followed, such as 'American Pie,' the Farrellys own 'There's Something About Mary,' all the way up to 'Superbad.' The 80s certainly had it's fair share of Porky's inspired raunch, but this new generation is a bit more story and character driven than their sleazier 80s counterparts. The main weakness of 'Kingpin' is that the sappy maudlin elements of the story, which do certainly make the characters more empathetic, are often incongruous with the raunchy and absurd comedic elements. It's hard to go from Harrelson 'milking' a bull or 'paying' his rent to his hideous landlady to caring whether he finds redemption and self respect. However, 'Kingpin' remains an enjoyably crass and rude comedy that although not be for all tastes is a hilarious treat if you can get into the spirit of the film. Vanessa Angel, Richard Tyson, Rob Moran, and Daniel Greene also appear in the film.",7,3,4,12 July 2018
Hancock," Likable, though lightweight, superhero send-up
","This film came out the same year as 'Iron Man,' which started off the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I think this clever send-up of superhero films should have come out later, when it could have been a commentary/satire of the now very played out superhero film. This story has Will Smith as an grungy, alcoholic superhero who will fly in to save the day for various situations, but does so drunkenly, haphazardly, and always with wild amounts of property damage. That is until he saves the life of PR man Jason Bateman who offers to help Hancock with an image makeover. It's a clever script by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan, from an earlier script by Vincent Ngo, though at it's heart it's still a lightweight summer comedy. Smith and Bateman are both quite likable, and Charlize Theron is good, though underused, as Bateman's wife. Directed by Peter Berg, who did the terrific movie and TV versions of 'Friday Night Lights,' but who also the insipid board game film adaptation 'Battleship,' delivers solid action and likable characters, which is better than you get in most summer blockbuster films.",6,2,4,1 July 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Unabashed popcorn film is enjoyably unpretentious entertainment (Kong smashed real good)
","And unabashed popcorn film, with no deeper meaning or subtext, is delightfully endearing in it's simple (although big budget) adventure story. Set during the waining day of the Vietnam War, John Goodman plays a government agent specializing in the strange and mysterious has discovered an uncharted island and convinces his superiors to give him a detail of soldiers from Vietnam to help him explore the titular island. That island is full to giants monster, mysterious natives, and also a WWII pilot who was shot down 25 years ago and doesn't know the war is over. John C. Reilly really steals the movie as the WWII solider marooned on Skull Island, but he does have competition from Samuel L. Jackson as the commanding officer leading the US soldiers helping Goodman, British airman Tom Hiddleston, and photojournalist Brie Larson. The action is fun, the characters are likable, and Kong smashes things real good. Beside John C. Reilly being awesome, the next most interesting element to the film is that it was set during the Vietnam War and treats the era with a rather light touch and not the usual downbeat tone that typically surrounds Vietnam set war films, which is something I cannot recall seeing in any other major film before (unless you want to count John Wayne's 'The Green Berets'). Throughout the 70s and 80s, most every Vietnam war film was pretty heavy, and even the ones with a lighter touch, like 'The Boys in Company C' or 'Good Morning, Vietnam,' still made sure the audience was aware that this was a terrible and horrific war. The version of Vietnam depicted in 'Kong: Skull Island' has the costumes, musics, and all the other trappings of just about every other memorable Vietnam film you can think of (from 'Apocalypse Now' to 'Born on the Fourth of July'), but it kind of just blew my mind out uncomplicated this war was presented. World War II has seen a lot of entertaining sci-fi and horror mash-ups, from Michael Mann's 'The Keep' to Disney's 'Bedknobs & Broomsticks' as well as lesser underrated films like 'The Final Countdown' or 'Zone Troopers.' There are so many of this sort of film that there's even an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to it. As for Vietnam, I think filmmakers stayed away from making light of that war because it was such a damaging war to our nation, not just politically and militarily, but culturally. Seeing the Vietnam War portrayed so differently in a blockbuster summer popcorn film made me realize that maybe we've reached a point in history where we've put enough distance between ourselves and that nearly 50-year old war, with three generations (Gen-X, Millenials, and Generation Z) who did not grow up with this war being part of their lives. It reminds me of the old Mark Twain quote, 'Humor is tragedy plus time.' For better or for worst, enough time must have passed now for Vietnam to now be fun. But I digress. Now Kong smashes things real good, fighting giant snakes and all sorts of other made up creatures. The CGI effects are excellent, but I'm a grouchy old man about CGI effects. I really want my giant movie monsters to either be men in monster suits crushing miniature sets or to be stop-motion animation. Computer generated animation takes me out of films and might as well be cartoon animation as far as I'm concerned. CGI works for backgrounds and explosions, but it doesn't work for for living people, animals, or creatures. Still, despite my annoyances with Hollywood's overuse of CGI, 'Kong: Skull Island' is pretty fun for a number of reasons, but primarily because of it's excellent cast and it's unpretentiously fun action and adventure, which comes off as a nice old fashioned adventure yarn, which is exactly what you need in a retelling of classic monster movie.",7,1,1,20 August 2018
Inception," Terrific Mindbender
","This is one of those films that warrants repeated viewings. The fascinating and complex story demands repeated viewings, much like director/write Nolan's previous work 'Memento'. All aspects of this film are top notch, writing, acting, directing, production design, music, photography. There was not a weak aspect of the film or anything I could imagine could be improved. A terrific film.",10,0,3,8 April 2017
Arrival," Think 'Solaris' or 'Contact,' not 'War of the Worlds' or 'Independence Day'
","Smart and visually arresting science fiction tale about earth's first contact with aliens. Mysterious floating monoliths appear around the world and linguist Amy Adams, with help of physicist Jeremy Renner, work with the government to try and communicate with the aliens amid global fears and international political tensions. This story is more 'Close Encounters' and 'Contact' than 'Independence Day' or 'War of the Worlds,' where the main focus of the story is on how to communicate with the aliens, while reassuring the military brass, primarily Forrest Whittaker, that everything is okay and they don't have to attack. This tension of whether they can successfully communicate and avert a conflict with this new species (and whether other countries around the world might tip off an interstellar as well) makes for good ticking time bomb of dramatic tension, but it's really Adams who give the film an emotional human center, desperately wanting to connect with to these advances creatures, while at the same time is haunted by visions of her daughter. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, who's next project was the new Blade Runner film, brings a strong visual style to the proceeding, but never in a way that is distracting to the story or style for the sake of style. My only complaint about the film is that it does move at a rather glacial pace, though in the end, the film does deliver with a terrific mind-bending of an ending, that makes the wait well worth it. Overall, 'Arrival' is not a film for anyone wanting slam-bang science fiction, but is great if you're in the mood for something along the lines of 'Solaris' or 'Moon.'",8,0,1,26 November 2017
Parasite," A comedy without clowns and a tragedy without villains
","Writer/director Bong Joon Ho ('The Host' 'Snowpiercer' 'Okja') has been on a roll of late with thought provoking genre films with underlying social commentary. From river monsters, to end-of-the-world tales, to a pig-like Totoro, Bong is not afraid to take seemingly popcorn concepts and work them into a smart film that has arthouse and movieplex crossover appeal. With 'Parasite' he takes a more subtle route and tells the story of a struggling family living in a tiny basement hovel in South Korea where they have to leech off neighbors unprotected wifi and deal with nightly public urination outside their alley-side windows. When the son lands a job as a tutor for the daughter of a rich family by pretending to be a college student and lying about his resume, he spots an opportunity to recommend his sister as an art teacher for the younger brother, hiding that she's his sister and lying about her credentials as well. Next the brother and sister scheme to get the chauffeur fired so their dad can land the job and then how to fire the longtime housekeeper so their mom can snatch that opening. To tell more would spoil the fun, but I will say the film takes an unexpected turn and dramatic shift in tone. I had no idea where the film was going or how it was going to end and the ultimate ending is quite a shocker. What's most interesting about the film is asking the question, who really is the parasite? Is it the lower class family living off the rich family host or is it this privileged rich family living off the backs of their working class servants? The answer is that it could be either or most likely both. Bong's thesis appears to be that this situation of haves and have-nots coexisting is untenable and will lead to an inevitable collision course, much as it happened in his prior film 'Snowpiercer.' Bong sums it up best himself when he was described 'Parasite' as 'a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains.' If I had a complaint about the film it's that the shift from humorous satire to something darker felt a bit incongruous, but Bong likely did this intentionally to bolster the film's message around the inevitable conclusion of a world of stark haves and have-nots. 'Parasite' is a compelling film that delivers a pure cinematic experience, meaning that it's a story that could not have been told in any other medium, and is an absolute treat for cinema lovers.",9,0,0,28 April 2020
The Conjuring," Well crafted and effective, although derivative, haunted house story
","No blood. No gore. No violence. But wonderfully suspenseful and scary haunted house story from director James Wan ('Saw' 'Furious 7' and the underrated 'Death Sentence'). The film is 'based on a true story' of real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson & Vera Farmiga) helping a family (Ron Livingston, Lili Taylor, and their brood of children) experiencing frightening and escalating supernatural attacks in their newly moved into rural home. Wan does a fine job of building suspense and in creating a dark unsettling atmosphere. A wonderfully eerie sound design greatly adds to the film's unsettling feel. If you're wondering how scary the film is, it managed to get an R-rating without any nudity, almost no profanity, and bloodless violence, earning the rating solely for it's pervasive frightening nature. The downside to the film is that although it's effectively suspenseful and scary, the story is is disappointingly derivative and familiar, with many similarities to other films, ranging from Robert Wise's 'The Haunting' to Tobe Hooper & Steven Spielberg's 'Poltergeist' to even the 'The Grudge.' Another disappointment is that Wan relies on a jump scare several times too often, which is pretty much the cheapest scare you can put into a horror film. Master of Horror John Carpenter once said it doesn't take any talent to make a jump scare, saying all you need to do is run a series of black frames and then splice in a white frame with a loud noise and you'll make the audience jump. One or two jump scares might be acceptable, but Wan goes to this well far too often and it comes off as a lazy way to scare the audience. Still, despite Wan's perchance for easy scares, he has made a film with believable characters and created a eerily atmospheric film that is well worth watching for horror fans, even if you've seen this type of story at lease a dozen times before.",8,0,0,22 October 2018
Scream," The original self-referential horror film is still the best
","21 years later (wow, I can't believe it's been that long) 'Scream' still holds up. Neve Campell plays a teen who's mom was murdered a year earlier by Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) and she and her friends are now being stalked by a new killer wearing a ghostface mask inspired by Edvard Munch's The Scream. What made this film stand out at the time was it's self referential humor that called out the many over-used tropes of 70s and 80s horror films. Jamie Kennedy's video store clerk character actually names some of them at one point in the film when the group is watching John Carpenter's 'Halloween,' stating that in order to survive a horror movie you must 1.) never have sex, 2.) never drink or do drugs, and 3.) never say 'I'll be right back.' 'Scream' came out at a time when horror films were getting pretty tired and formulaic, so a film that called out the formula while also being scary and exciting in it's own right deservedly became a major hit, spawning three sequels and a TV series. Most horror films at this time were the likes of bad Chucky, Freddy, Jason, Howling, Omen, Amityville, Leprechaun, and too many other unwanted sequels to mention, so something original was very welcome (okay, the early 90s also had some good horror films too; Misery, Night of the Living Dead, Nightbreed, Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, Tremors, Body Parts, Candyman, Lord of Illusions, In the Mouth of Madness, and The Frighteners, but far more of this era were garbage). This film does get credit and/or blame for spawning a spate of imitators that were equally self referential and winking at the audience, which itself got very tired and thankfully ended when more straight-faced of horror films took over again following Eli Roth's intense 'Hostel' in 2005. 'Scream' was directed by Wes Craven, who actually gets credit for helping establish the formulas Kevin Williamson's script mocks. Although the script is clearly making fun of these well worn horror formulas and cliches, it also has an affection for them, gleefully embracing the horror topes of everyone's-a-suspect, the-final-girl, or the-killers-not-dead to name just a few. The film also features a terrific cast, who were great at the time and is even better now, including Neve Campbell as the final-girl, Courteney Cox as a pushy reporter, David Arquette as a dopey cop, Henry Winkler as the principal, Linda Blair in a cameo as another obnoxious reporter, director Wes Craven as Fred the Janitor, and various teens include Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Jamie Kennedy, and Rose McGowan. There's also voice artist Roger Jackson as the memorable scary voice on the phone and Drew Barrymore is great in a Marion Crane-like cameo for the opening sequence of the film. Looking through the film's other credits, it was edited by Patrick Lussier, who'd go on to direct the underrated 'Drive Angry' and co-write the surprisingly good 'Terminator Genisys.' The film was shot by Mark Irwin (who also photographed my kids' current favorite movie 'Descendants 2'), brining sharp fluid photogrpahy to the picture, along with a nicely consistent color scheme that's vibrant and also muted in a way that recalls the VHS horror films of the 70s and 80s. My main complaint about the film is that I personally do not like films that are so overly self referential and break the third wall. I prefer my horror film to be straight-faced, but this is forgivable given state of horror films at this time and also how sharp Williamson's script is at times. Overall, 'Scream' is a suspenseful, clever, and witty mystery with a strong cast and loads of fun gory scares along with way.",8,0,0,2 January 2018
Halloween," The REAL originator of the modern day slasher film
","There are a number of films that have been credited as the progenitor of the modern day slasher film. 'Psycho,' Italian Giallo films, and 70s's exploitation films like 'The Town that Dreaded Sundown,' 'Black Christmas,' or 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' are all often cited as early examples of slasher films, but it's really John Carpenter's 'Halloween' that set the formula of the unstoppable killer dispensing with hapless oversexed teens. Those other films all had elements of the slasher film formula, but 'Halloween' is the one that cemented the slasher film genre tropes (including but not limited to the final girl, don't have sex, and the masked emotionless killer). Set in the fictional everytown American city of Haddonfield, Illinois, the story takes place on Halloween night 15 years after the horrific murders by a young boy named Michael Myers. Myers (simply referred to in the credits as 'The Shape') escapes from the mental institution where he's been housed since childhood to come back home with unprovoked murder on his mind. Jamie Lee Curtis (the real-life daughter of Psycho's Janet Leigh in her film debut) and her group of gal pals (including P.J. Soles) are babysitting and fooling around with their boyfriends on Hallows eve when Myers begins his rack up a body count. The story is lean and efficient, but it's Carpenter's masterful building of suspense that makes this films such a classic. Instead of relying on cheap scares and gratuitous violence (there's actually very little blood or graphic violence), Carpenter takes the time to develop his characters and to take the time to build suspense (Carpenter once derided jump scares, saying anyone can do that. Just run a hundred frames black and then insert one white frame with a loud noise and the audience will jump.) This focus on character and suspense elevates 'Halloween' compared to most of it's ilk. Also worth noting is Nick Castle's performance as The Shape, giving an eerie performance that's better than you'd expect. On a side note, Castle went on to co-write 'Escape from New York' with Carpenter and to also direct the very underrated comedy 'Major Payne.' Most slasher film simply cast a stuntman in these types of roles, but Castle brings something special to Myers (wearing what is actually a Captain James T. Kirk rubber mask sprayed white, with the eyebrows and sideburns removed). Many may discount Castle's performance and contribution to the film, but as fans of the Friday the 13th films know, Kane Hodder is by far the best of all the actors to play Jason Voorhees. Besides the excellent suspense and the frightening emotionless killer, Carpenter's score is the final crucial element that makes this film so memorable and such a horror classic. Carpenter's synthesizer heavy score is eerie, jarring, and terrifying all at once. Two of these three elements will be part of the 2018 Halloween sequel/reboot (Nick Castle returning as The Shape and Carpenter returning to score the film) and I'm hopeful the suspense will equal Carpenter's masterful touch. Subsequent sequels where Carpenter was not involved (part 4 onward) relied more on routine slasher violence and didn't bother to build much suspense, which was the downfall of the franchise, along with an overly complicated and ridiculous backstory for Myters (although I will say I was a fan of Rob Zombie's reboot films). Donald Pleasence as Myers' twitchy and terrified psychiatrist is also a standout in the film. Carpenter's also inserts all sorts of fun film nerd inside jokes throughout the picture, particularly if you're a fan of Howard Hawks films. Overall, 'Halloween' is arguably THE most influential film on modern day horror cinema and although it's pacing can be slow and almost meandering at times, once it revs up, it's a suspenseful thrill ride that holds up to this day. FUN FACT! Donald Pleasence told John Carpenter the main reason he took the part of Dr. Loomis was because his daughter, who was a musician, loved Carpenter's score for his previous film, 'Assault on Precinct 13.'",9,1,1,14 July 2018
Creed II," More of a 'Rocky IV' sequel and a 'Creed' sequel
","Solid sequel is entertaining, but felt less like a sequel to 'Creed' and more like a sequel to 'Rocky IV,' with Rocky continuing to mentor young Adonis Creed, an excellent Michael B. Jordan, only this time Adonis has to fight the son Rocky's dirty commie nemesis, Ivan Drago, who killed Adonis' father at a Vegas James Brown concert (okay, I'm going glib). With the writer/director of the first Creed film, Ryan Coogler, moving on to bigger and better things, writing and directing duties were turned over to others and this sequel loses some of the human element that elevated 'Creed' above other Rocky sequels. 'Creed II' is takes more time to develop characters than most Rocky sequels and avoids the jingoism and silliness of 'Rocky IV' (there's no equivalent of Paulie and Rocky's robot maid or Rocky's Regan-era anti-commie speech at the end). The subtext of fathers and sons looms large over 'Creed II' as Rocky and Dolph Lundgren's Ivan Drago both seek redemption through their sons (a surrogate son in the case of Rocky) that builds to a climactic battle in the ring. But to put the film in perspective, it's really only a few scenes, such as one between Rocky and Drago at his rrestaurant, that have the kind of poignancy that made the first Creed film such a standout. Michael B. Jordan continues to shine as the film's lead, but for me, this film felt like it was more about Rocky and Drago having one last battle. I was also tickled to see Brigitte Nielsen (Stallone's real-life ex-wife) reprise her role from 'Rocky IV' as Drago's wife (now ex-wife) in a brief cameo that greatly helped to define the current state of Drago's character today. Overall, 'Creed II' is nowhere as good as the original film, but does offer more humanity than most Rocky sequels and remains an entertaining fight film that's well worth checking out. FUN FACT: Stallone is now two years older than Burgess Meredith when he trained Rocky in the original 1976 film.",6,0,0,26 April 2020
Final Destination," Okay horror flick from ex-X-Files talent
","This film had a definitely inserting concept, that a group of teens who have 'cheated' death after abruptly departing an airplane that ends up exploding upon takeoff, who then find themselves fighting for their lives as death stalks them in the form of a series of elaborate fatal and/or near fatal accidents and mishaps (ranging from seemingly simple bathroom slip and falls, to downed power lines, to elaborate car and train sequences). The film was written and directed by 'X-Files' veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong, so from a technical standpoint, it's a well crafted film with excitement, suspense, and thrills. However, I'm not sure the film's premise was enough to sustain a feature length film. It also doesn't help that the characters are not all that interesting, though it is kind of fun to see a young Ali Larter. Overall, this film this lacked story and characters to sustain itself, but the elaborate death sequences were interesting and suspenseful enough to hold my interest and make the film worth watching.",5,0,0,20 May 2017
The Purge," Great set-up becomes a routine (although very well done) siege film
","Writer/Director James DeMonaco provides a dynamite set-up with the opening title card that reads, 'America. 2022. Unemployment is at 1%. Crime is at an all-time low. Violence barely exists. with one exception...' That exception is The Purge. A government sanctioned annual 12-hour period in where all criminal activity, including murder, becomes legal. It's an insane premise that's ripe for unhinged Devil's Night mayhem along with all sorts of possibilities for commentary on society, politics, economics, ethics, and human nature. What's disappointing is that doesn't explore it's thematic potential and is instead a fairly routine siege film. The story follows wealthy home security salesman Ethan Hawke and this family on Purge Day, hunkering down when they find themselves the target of a well armed group trying to get in. There are some thematic nods regarding the economics of the haves and have-nots, but it never really goes all that deep. Despite my disappointment in terms of unexplored thematic potential, 'The Purge' is a well done exciting and suspenseful siege film. It's not up to John Carpenter 'Assault on Precinct 13' standards, but it's leaps an bounds better than Bruce Willis' 'Hostage' or WWE's 'The Day.' The film also benefits from a stronger than average cast for a genre film, which besides Hawke also features Lena Headey as his wife. Rhys Wakefield, who was previously unknown to me, is also very memorable as the 'Polite Leader' of the group trying to get inside their home to murder a homeless man their young son has given shelter to. And one bit of film geek casting that had me giddy was the casting of character actor Chirs Mulkey as one of Hawke's neighbors. Given the film's modest budget, it understandably couldn't have had the scale that the story premise could have lent itself to. According to IMDB, writer/director DeMonaco said that if he ever got a chance to do a second film, it would be more like 'Escape from New York.' He's since made two sequels and a fourth is in the works, so I can only hope that the sequels are worthy that build up (I'm actually very excited to watch the sequels now). Overall, even though the film's subtext is left largely left unexplored and the siege elements of the film were very familiar, the strong cast, the unique story premise, and DeMonaco's tight, suspenseful direction make 'The Purge' a real winner for genre fans.",8,0,1,5 March 2018
A Nightmare on Elm Street," First is still the best, focusing on primal fears versus wisecracks
","Wes Craven's classic original film that spawned a highly influential franchised (and a terrible reboot) is still the best of them all. Craven cooks up an irresistible premise of child murderer Fred Kreuger killing the kids of Elm Street in their dreams as revenge for his mob justice murder by their parents may years before. What makes the set-up work so well is the blurring of the lines between dreams and reality when Kreuger stalks the kids in their dream. The characters fight sleep to avoid Kreuger, but are never quite sure when reality may have drifted into dreams after they may have dozed off in class, in a bathtub, or wherever they might be at any moment. Once reality moves into the dreamworld, Craven plays off of some of our most primal of fears; claws, drowning, burning, not knowing what's a dream and what's reality, and, of course, being killed in your dreams. In many ways, this film stands in stark contrast to the rest of the series. Most notably Freddy Krueger (in this film referred to as Fred Kreuger) has a total of 7-minutes screen time. This film is mainly about the Elm Street kids trying to figure out what's going on and how to stop Krueger. This film is also much stronger than the sequels because Freddy is not yet the wisecracking, one-liner delivering character he later became, which has the impact of making him a much more frightening of character. Since this is the first film in the franchise, it gets to tell the origin story of Freddy and Elm Street, which is more interesting than the sequels ('Dream Warriors' and 'New Nightmare' being the exceptions) and who all basically recycled the same material but with bigger budgets and set pieces. Heather Langenkamp is quite good in the lead as Nancy and Amanda Wyss is good as well as her best friend. I did like how Craven (SPOILER ALERT!) pulled a bit of a Marion Crane by starting the film with Wyss, who gets killed off about 20-minutes into the picture and the film then shifts it's focus to Langenkamp. It's also pretty fun to see a teenage Johnny Depp in his film debut. And, of course, Robert Englund is very scary and effective as Fred Kreuger, even if he's not on screen all that much. Englund really made this character his own throughout this series and England's absence from the remake is a major reason why that film did not work. Also worth mentioning is the iconic music from Charles Bernstein, who for some reason never scored another film in the series, and also of note is the wonderfully surreal and dreamlike photography by Jacques Haitkin, who's now a second unit director of photography on major Hollywood films like Captain America films, the Fast & Furious films, and even the new King Kong film, 'Kong: Skull Island.' My main complaint about the film is the ending. The producers wanted a twist ending that left it open for a sequel and Craven wanted a happy ending. I'm not completely opposed to twist endings, though more often than not they don't work, or even unhappy endings, but I do think this film would have worked better if it had more definitive of resolution. And regarding the producers desire for potential sequels, Jason got killed at the end most every Friday the 13th film and managed to come back over and over again. Why wouldn't that work here too? Overall, this is Craven's best film and one that really got under my skin as a kid back in the day watching it over and over on VHS, but what's so great about the film is that it still holds up today, both in concept and in suspense and scares.",9,1,2,20 October 2017
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Two very endearing lead characters carry a weak comedy
","Bill & Ted for a time became the common nomenclature for two dumb guys, which is kind of surprising since this film was never considered a classic, but it's also not so surprising since this comedy is as likable and unpretentious as it's two main characters. The silly story has the two not-so-bright So-Cal dudes, Alex Winter (Bill S. Preston, Esq.) and Keanu Reeves (Ted 'Theodore' Logan), hoping to form their band Wyld Stallyns, but Ted's dad is going ship him off to military school because of failing grades, which the only way he can bring them up is by nailing his history report and presentation to 'Express to the class how an important historical figure from each of your time periods would view the world of San Dimas, 1988.' Enter a time traveling George Carlin as Rufus, who gives the pair a time machine to kidnap historic figures to help him finish and nail the assignment. The duo go back in time to kidnap Billy the Kid, Abraham Lincoln, Joan of Arc (Jane Wielding), Socrates, Sigmund Freud, Napoleon, Genghis Khan, and Beethoven and mild hilarity ensures. Time travel is a ripe premiss for any number of genres and it's roots in comedy go back to the days of Mark Twain, where he mined similar culture clash humor of past and modern day ideas and values. However, that may be overstating the level of the humor in this film. Bill shouting 'You medieval dickweed!' is pretty funny, but that's about as funny and clever as this film gets, although Al Leong as Genghis Khan tearing up a sporting goods store is a close second. Despite the mediocre humor, I think the under appreciated element that made Bill & Ted work is the likability of the two main characters. Bill and Ted are kind, caring, and earnest, even if they're not the sharpest knives in the drawer. Winter and Reeves fully commit to their dumb-guy roles. So well in fact that it took Reeves years to not automatically be pigeonholed by audiences as a doofus, despite appearing in plenty of straight roles ranging from 'Speed' to 'My Own Private Idaho' to the underrated and somewhat forgotten 'River's Edge.' So despite the film's humor not being all that clever, Bill and Ted's infectious likability and unpretentiousness carry the film, making it enjoyable to this day. Bernie Casey and Diane Franklin also appear in the film.",7,1,1,12 July 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," Keanu has completely divested himself of Ted
","Keanu has tried to shed his dumb guy persona for quite some time. Even in excellent films like 'Point Break' or 'The Matrix' he was still playing a doofus. With the John Wick films, Keanu is a next level badass and completely divests himself from Ted (although he's reprising his role in an upcoming third film). This sequel picks up right after the first John Wick film, with Keanu being pressured to pay back a debt that originally got him out of his hitman life in the first place. He's been asked to kill a powerful mob boss by her brother. After doing so, the brother puts a huge bounty on Wick's head and he has to fight off hitmen and hitwomen at every turn. That is everywhere except for The Continental Hotel, an underworld sanctuary run by Ian McShane where no killing is allowed. When characters who've fought each other to a bloody pulp meet up at the Continental, they must peacefully coexist. However, as cool as The Continental is of an addition to the John Wick universe, it's the unbelievably great action sequences from director Chad Stahelski and writer Derek Kolstad that make this film so memorable, even for even the most jaded of action film fan. Kolstad's script sets up some great action sequences (there's an excellent hall of mirrors finale, although most filmmakers should know that they're never going to top Orson Welles' 'The Lady from Shanghai' climax), but it's director Chad Stahelski who makes the action sequences something wholly original and something not seen on screen before. Hong Kong action films of the 80s and 90s brought something original and new to action films (which were then endlessly imitated in American action films like 'The Matrix' or 'Desperado', but there really hasn't been anything since then that seemed all that different from what's come before (maybe Kurt Wimmer's 'Gun-Fu' in 'Equilibrium' and 'Ultraviolet,' but that too borrowed heavily from Hong Kong action cinema). The action in John Wick is fast, aggressive, and mixes hand-to-hand and gun-play in a way that has not been done before on film. The film is expertly shot by ace cinematographer Dan Laustsen ('The Shape of Water' 'Crimson Peak' 'Silent Hill' 'Brotherhood of the Wolf'). The action is fast, bloody, and brutal, which is to say it's not going to be for all tastes, but if you're a fan of action films, you'll likely find this sequel equal if not better than the first John Wick film. Besides the top tier action, you have an even better cast than the first film, which includes Riccardo Scamarcio, Ruby Rose (as a very cool mute hitwoman), Laurence Fishburne, John Leguizamo, Bridget Moynahan, David Patrick Kelly, Peter Stormare, and even Franco Nero! Top that off by a surprise appearance by a Commodore VIC-20 used by The Continental Hotel staff and at the end of the film and that adds up to one of the best action films to come out in years!",9,1,2,24 July 2018
Inside Llewyn Davis," A rather moody turn for the Coensis a folk music spiritual sequel to 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?'
","Joel Coen remarked regarding the film that it 'doesn't really have a plot. That concerned us at one point; that's why we threw the cat in.' The Coens are notoriously tight lipped about their films, but this offhand remark is a pretty insightful into the type of film they intended to make with 'Inside Llewyn Davis.' Telling the story of struggling 1960s folk singer Llewyn Davis, the film ends up an ode to capturing a specific time and place, as well as a celebration of the 60s folk music scene. Oscar Isaac ('Ex Machina' and Poe Dameron in the latest Star Wars trilogy) plays the intense Llewyn and spends the film in a wintery NYC couch surfing, trying to reach a wider audience with his music, and wanting to land a record deal or even a gig. The first couch he lands on he ends up losing the owner's cat and that becomes the main narrative thread of the film, such as it is, but the film is really about an artist so committed and uncompromising in his vision that he ends up unable to find success or an audience. Ironically, this is a trap the idiosyncratic Coen Brothers have manage to avoid, finding success in their modestly budgeted films, which has given them a level of autonomy that's allowed them to achieve their vision. There was criticism of 'Inside Llewyn Davis' by actual folk singers of this era that it wasn't an accurate depiction and that it was NOT a happy tight knit community and was more made up of competition and backbiting. Still, it's a gorgeous representation of a time and place, even if it's a bit of a fairy tale. This is the crisp wintery New York City I remember seeing in actual NYC films during this actual period, like 'A Thousand Clowns' or 'The Pawnbroker.' The film is gorgeously photographed by Bruno Delbonnel, known for working with the likes of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Tim Burton, and with Peter Bogdanovich on his Jazz Age tale, 'The Cat's Meow' (the Coens' regular cinematographer, Roger Deakins, was unavailable shooting 'Skyfall'). The production design detail is dynamite! Watching the film I just wanting step onto the screen and be a part of this 1960s NYC, even if it's a fairy tale version that never existed (sort of how I also want to step onto California shore of a Beach Party movie). 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is fascinating in how it holds the viewer's attention despite the lack of a strong narrative. This is in large part thanks to the talents of Oscar Isaac as Davis, making this flawed and at times unlikable character compelling to watch for for nearly two hours, as well as the Coen's deft touch for creating a stylized atmosphere, colorful characters, and filling the film with memorable songs and soundscapes (another element they are often not given enough credit for), in what is probably their best use of music since 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake also appear in the film as successful folk singers Jim & Jean, as does Adam Driver in a funny bit part, and Coen Brothers regular John Goodman makes a memorable appearance as an obnoxious jazz musician. Overall, 'Inside Llewyn Davis' has more heart than most Coen Brothers' films and I would argue stands amongst their finest. FUN FACT! The singing voice of Mike, Llewyn's deceased music partner, is Marcus Mumford from the band Mumford & Sons, and actress Carey Mulligan's husband.",10,1,1,12 August 2019
The Nice Guys," Shane Black successfully mines the buddy-cop film formula he helped create
","Terrifically fun buddy-cop film throwback from writer/director Shane Black, one of the folks responsible for establishing the 80s action films subgenera with 'Lethal Weapon' and 'The Last Boy Scout.' Set in a scuzzy Boogie Nights looking 1970s L.A., an unlikely duo of smart down on his luck P.I. Holland March, Ryan Gosling, and dimwitted hired thug Jackson Healy, a scene stealing Russell Crowe, form an uneasy alliance in trying to find a missing porn actress named Misty Mountains. From there the plot gets more serpentine and complicated, but what makes this film so fun and worth watching is the banter between Gosling and Crowe, where you get hilariously throwaway moments like:Holland March: Look on the bright side. Nobody got hurt.
Jackson Healy: People got hurt.
Holland March: I'm saying, I think they died quickly. So I don't think they got hurt.OrJackson Healy: So, you know the old lady, right? Did you believe her?
Holland March: What about?
Jackson Healy: When she said she saw Misty alive that night, did you believe her?
Holland March: God, no. She's blind as a bat.
Jackson Healy: Uh-huh.
Holland March: She has actual coke bottles for glasses. You paint a mustache on a Volkswagen, she says, 'Boy, that Omar Sharif sure runs fast.'OrJackson Healy: The place reeks of marijuana. They're smoking it.
Holland March: I can't smell.
Jackson Healy: What?
Holland March: I got hit in the head a while back. I lost my sense of smell.
Jackson Healy: You can't smell?
Holland March: Yeah.
Jackson Healy: You're a detective, and you can't smell?
Holland March: Yeah.
Jackson Healy: Aw, this just keeps getting better and better.
Holland March: Wow, that's really insensitive.Gosling and Crowe have a great chemistry that cries out for a sequel to happen so audiences can enjoy their future adventures in this sleazy 1970s coke filled version of Los Angels (although the film was sadly a box office disappointment). The other standout performer is Angourie Rice, playing Gosling's quick witted and smart-mouthed daughter Holly (reminiscent of Danielle Harris' character in Black's 'The Last Boy Scout' as Bruce Willis' smart-mouthed daughter), who has some great banter herself with Crowe's Jackson when she finds out what he does for a living:Holly March: You beat people up and charge money?
Jackson Healy: Yeah.
Holland March: Sad, isn't it?
Holly March: How much would you charge to beat up my friend Janet?
Holland March: What?
Jackson Healy: How much you got?
Holly March: Thirty bucks.
Holland March: That's good, this conversation is over.Holly also has some hilarious father/daughter interaction as well, such as when she hides out in the trunk of the car to follow Gosling and Crowe to coke filled party populated with adult film stars and observes:Holly March: Dad, there's like whores here and stuff.
Holland March: Sweetheart, how many times have I told you? Don't say 'and stuff'. Just say 'Dad, there are whores here'.
Holly March: Well, there's like a ton.That last interaction leads to a great callback later in the film when Holly is talking to a young adult film actress that's too inappropriate to repeat here, but it's probably the biggest laugh of the film. Overall, 'The Nice Guys' is charmingly retro, from it's use of the 1970s Warners Bros. logo at the film's opening to the fabulous cars and costumes to a fun soundtrack, it all gives the the feel of a politically incorrect R-rated version of The Rockford Files. Keith David, Lois Smith, Gil Gerard, and Kim Basinger also appear in the film.",8,0,1,17 July 2018
The Wizard of Oz," Despite dated elements, there's an undeniable charm and magic to enchants kids today
","I took my kids to watch the TCM revival showing of 'The Wizard of OZ' on the big screen and my 6 and 9-year old were just as enchanted and terrified of the film as I was as a child. I won't bother to summarize the plot, because everyone already knows the story. Rewatching it now, it's fun to see how this film has influenced everything from the 1980s version of 'Flash Gordon,' to Jim Henson's 'Labyrinth,' to obscure sci-fi comedies like 'Heartbeeps,' to even J.R.R. Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings.' The film is admittedly slow at times, some songs are better than others ('If I Only Had a Brain' and 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' are the high points), and it's incredibly corny though out, but there is an undeniable charm and magic to the proceedings. Although many newer films have better special effects, less mannered of acting, and far better production design, they don't hold a candle to the wonder and magic of this true American film classic.",8,3,4,21 June 2019
