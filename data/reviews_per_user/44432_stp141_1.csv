Skyfall," mean-spirited movie
","I got the strong impression that this movie is promoting gay-hating. The only apparently gay character was the villain, who made advances toward Bond. This scene appears to have been introduced solely to promote hostility toward gay people. The writers, producers and actors deserve scorn for participating in what appears to be an attempt to vilify a group of people through a totally fictional plot. Even though, in reality, gay people are probably completely innocent of being super villains and molesting super spies.Sadly, it appears that some Brits still have problems with homophobia, rooted in archaic Victorian priggery, from which they cannot rise above. It is particularly appalling that these people are in the movie business where they seek to propagandize their primitive malice through dishonest scripts that get produced and acted out.",1,4,10,19 September 2015
