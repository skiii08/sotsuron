The Blair Witch Project," Scary?
","I don't understand why everyone thinks this movie was so scary? I think people have been told for so long how incredible this was that they talked themselves into the hype. Halloween H2O was a short, scary movie, well worth seeing twice. This, I don't even think I would bother to rent when it comes out on video. To each his own I guess.",Null,0,0,6 August 1999
