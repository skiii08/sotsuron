Scarface," scarred up for life - the spiritual side of scarface
","Much of the good things have already been said about scarface, to say it as a landmark film in the gangster genre is definitely without a doubt. Critics from the very first release of this movie have complained about the 210 f words and the violence, but these are things that are necessary to a gangster picture, especially one that represents a dynasty. (each gangster movie has a different style of doing violence, the 'cleaner' ones are that of godfather and once upon a time in America, De Palma's choice of violence in this movie is only to enhance the viewing, whether you like it or not, it is up to you. As a viewer, you should only have the right to comment on the quality of such style rather than completely denigrating it) Having said all that, i now turn to the issue that has not been discussed often on this board. To a segment of viewers, Scarface is not a drug movie, it's more about the determination for power, to go higher and higher in the world. There are no other issues that are more important than this, Bregman, the producer wanted the movie to head this way because it shows something that is inside everyone of us. Some of the viewers do not openly agree, but this is the main reason most of the fans are drawn to this movie. This movie represents the reality of the world, that to achieve success, you somewhat have to inherit Tony's traits. Tony's strength in front of the chainsaw, his wit when facing Sosar and his determination in the argument between Frank for the $15m deal are all very admirable and respectable. The audience love these parts, it is not wrong to respect someone who has paid a price to achieve his goals even though he did so through a rather evil but common street business of the time.To treat the movie as a 'bible' would definitely be too much, but it is rare to find a movie which gives such notion of survival in a capitalistic world.",10,0,1,24 April 2005
