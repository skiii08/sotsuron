Minority Report," Great Film, Great Cinema
","I've seen Minority Report twice now, in different company, and have thoroughly enjoyed it both times. Was moved and excited and engaged throughout. It's a film you need to take your brain along for, and much as I enjoy a mindless film occasionally, was getting tired of there not being much else around.This is the first film I've ever watched where I've noticed and loved a car! Aside from that the film presents a lot of things to think about. Not only is there the central question of 'how just is a system which punishes people who haven't committed a crime?' but also about privacy invasion - all persons are not only identified and registered globally by retinal scan, but are continually and publicly identified by scanners set all over the place. The future of truly targeted advertising is far more frightening in some ways than the idea of having your windows kicked in by rapidly descending men in black.A great film, a trifle sentimental in places but doesn't over do it, I think. More - it's a great film for the wide screen, the effects are great but it's the story, the plot which drives the film, not the effects.Special mention should go to Samantha Morton as Agatha, very impressive.",9,0,0,25 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Pleasantly surprised
","Having waited impatiently for the new trilogy and being a trifle disappointed with The Phantom Menace, though I still watch it often - just to see if I've changed my mind, you understand, - I was a trifle apprehensive about Attack of the Clones, not least because I think it's a naff title. Still think it's a naff title but for the rest - thoroughly enjoyed it. Drawbacks - a couple of places looked too much like preparation for the computer game release, and I can't get past the whole Senator and whinghy Annie thing. Having said that, the love story was done as well as they could do it, I think. For me, best thing about the film was the underlying politics, who and what the Clones are - a surprise turn around there - wasn't expecting that. Also the Cloners themselves, very impressive. Was pleased the rumour about Obi-Wan being jealous of Annie over Amidala wasn't true. I've voted an 8 out of 10 on this one and am looking eagerly forward to the next episode.",8,0,0,25 July 2002
