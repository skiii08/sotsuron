The Monuments Men," Monumental cast in a monumental disappointment
","'The Monuments Men' was a film I'd been looking forward to seeing in some time. I'm a big fan of war films, and equally a big fan of most of the impressively assembled cast. This could be classified as an adventure/war film that flirts with the idea of trying to be a comedy. But funny it is not, and is in fact a monumental disappointment, not doing any justice at all to the story.George Clooney plays a re-incarnated version of various characters he has played before, as he leads a team of museum curators and art experts on a mission to war-torn Europe in a bid to save art from the Nazi's and by the films end, the Russians. The film's premise is promising, and should have made for a cracking film, but then falls down pretty much after the first scene. Other than Cate Blanchette (who is amazing in most of her roles) the rest of the star-studded line-up were terrible. Matt Damon was bland in his role, Bill Murray looked disinterested throughout, John Goodman looked as though he's fallen off the wagon again, Jean Dujardin had this stupid smirk on his face before meeting a stupidly conceived demise, and Hugh Bonneville didn't actually do anything except die. Even the two German baddies featured were unconvincing. There was no real action, and absolutely no emotional attachment to any of the characters. I thought it was a shame that more of them weren't killed. The Americans all survived (sigh), with the two foreign participants both dying (sigh). This film was dreadfully dull and far too predictable.In all, a hugely disappointing film. I wouldn't even bother with this on a DVD night. In fact, I want my twelve bucks back, George. I'm not happy at all. Next time I'm in Como, I'll be dropping by your villa looking for a refund. You've been great in other films, but your performance in this one really sucked... along with your direction. Maybe stick to more contemporary themes in the future. And don't be making any more films with Matt Damon because you'll ruin him if you produce another turkey like this one and he's in it.",3,4,5,16 April 2014
The Expendables," Yawn, yawn, yawn!
","Oh dear, where do I start? The ageing Sylvester Stallone assembles a very impressive cast for this unmitigated disaster of a movie. Whilst I wasn't expecting a collection of the greatest action films ever rolled into one epic blockbuster, I was hoping for something a little more substantial than this embarrassment.The plot; a group of over-the-hill mercenaries do the business on a fictitious island, killing hundreds of baddies in the process, whilst miraculously not enduring any casualties themselves! Yawn.Opening with an attack on a ship hijacked by Somali pirates, (and I doubt very much that any of them were actually Somali) stupid dialogue is sprouted off right before the baddies get massacred. With Dolph Lundgren about to hang the last one, his comrades protest by saying 'that's not how we operate,' before being attacked by Jet Li. Yawn.Back in the world, the goodies all assemble at a tattoo parlour owned by the appropriately named Tool (Mikey Rourke). Spouting off some nonsense about a girl jumping off a bridge in Bosnia - yawn - he dishes out the jobs, lining up a meeting with Bruce and Arnie. The meeting takes all of 60 seconds, just long enough for a really pathetic joke about Arnie running for president. Yawn.Visiting the island where a dodgy dictator needs sorting out, it becomes clear that a dodgy ex-CIA goon is the real target, which Sly manages to figure out all by himself. Yawn. The rest of the film is basically a yawn fest, with lots of fights, explosions, baddies being killed, and the pretty girl being saved. Yawn.I wish I could build a time machine, go back to the other night and stop myself from going in to see this drivel! For film fans from the 80's and 90's, stay at home and watch 'Die Hard,' 'Under Siege,' or 'Speed,' instead of putting yourself through 90 minutes of unadulterated nonsense.'The Expendables' should sweep the Razzies next year. Definitely wait for this film to come out on DVD, and then use it as a drinks coaster!",3,9,17,3 September 2010
Interstellar," Interstellar, a sci-fi movie for the ages... almost
","So I got around to seeing this yesterday, and really enjoyed it. I do like Christopher Nolan's films, and I would rate this as his fifth effort â€“ behind 'Inception,' 'Momento' and the first two Batman films. In 'Interstellar,' Nolan reaches for the stars, and has created a sci-fi movie for the ages... almost. The result isn't quite the '2001' of this generation, but I do think that sci-fi from this point on will need to aim high in terms of ideas and concepts presented in films, which is going to be amazing for sci-fi fans.Set around 40-50 years in the future, life on Earth is fast approaching its use by date, as food is running out due to a number of factors. The discovery of a worm-hole near Saturn presents scientists with the possibility that humanity may be able to continue on an Earth-like planet on the other side of the wormhole. To that end, the Endurance mission follows up the earlier Lazarus missions, which were a series of manned missions seeking worlds that might be able to sustain human life. What follows is a lot of science and drama, with an ending which was a bit 2001, and will have fans of the film debating various aspects of the film until the end of time.Taking two years to reach Saturn, before traversing through the wormhole, the Endurance encounters the first of three targeted planets; Miller, which is an ocean planet where tsunamis the size of sky-scrappers appear to be a regular occurrence, Also, due to Miller's close proximity to a Black Hole, the gravity of the planet means that for every hour on the surface of the planet, seven years elapses back on Endurance, orbiting the planet. By the time Cooper and Brand return to orbit, 23 years have passed on Endurance.With much of the Endurances resources exhausted as a result of this leg of the mission, the crew must decide between one of the remaining two planets, or give up on the idea of returning to Earth. Mann is chosen, where the crew find and revive Dr Mann, the leader of the Lazarus missions. His glacier covered planet turns out to be unsuitable, and his data was faked in the hope of being rescued. In an attempt to hijack the mission, Mann meets his doom, along with one of the other characters.Following a daring return to Endurance, which is now hopelessly low on fuel, Cooper pilots the ship, so it sling shots around the black-hole, launching it towards Edmund, the third planet, but launching himself into the black-hole in the process. It was a bit 2001 at this point, as Cooper finds himself in a dimension where time is not linear. Cooper then finds a way to communicate with the adult Murph, giving her information that allows for the space station being constructed on Earth to be launched, thus allowing for the eventual evacuation and relocation to the new world. Having completed his mission, Cooper then miraculously finds himself floating in space, back on other side of the wormhole, having become a fetal being enclosed in a transparent orb of light floating in space gazing at the Earth... I'm just gagging. Cooper is in fact floating in space, near Saturn, and is rescued by NASA rangers, who deliver him to a large space station, a further 50-60 years into the future. He reunites with his elderly daughter, who on her death bed, tells him to go back through the worm hole and find Brand, who has set up camp on Edmund, but is all alone. The performance of the cast was very good, with Matthew McConaughey dominating the film throughout. Anne Hathaway was good, although I can't help but feel that perhaps Nolan could have used someone a few years older, especially since it's revealed that her character had a relationship with one of the Lazarus astronauts, whom had embarked on his mission 10 years before the Endurance mission. Michael Caine is usually good in everything he does. Matt Damon's cameo was good too, although similar to Hathaway, perhaps the director could have used someone older. In terms of the presentation of the film, it was beautifully shot, as you would expect a film with such a large budget to be. The scenery on Mann, which was filmed in Iceland, was quite spectacular. The musical score by Hans Zimmer was out of this world, and will possibly get a few nods when awards' season rolls around. I liked the story as a whole a lot, although it did contain a few plot holes. Some questions I found myself asking at the end of the movie included things like; how could NASA execute such a large and costly mission without the public knowing? Why was the first planet (Miller) given the thumbs up given that it was completely covered by water? Given the length of time spent on the Miller leg of the mission, would NASA (or somebody else) not have launched another mission? Finally, with the space station positioned near the worm-hole, why hasn't anyone else gone through it? Overall, the film is highly entertaining, and will do ridiculously well at the box office, so much so that a sequel might possibly come about. I do think many reviewers are getting a bit carried away by awarding this film a 10, which clearly it is not.For me, this is a 7. The scope of this film is grand and ambitious, but it does fall short of being great. I'll probably go and watch it again, mostly in the search for answers I know I probably want get. I do recommend the film to sci-fi buffs, and also for Matthew McConaughey fans, but if you don't fall into either category, the film is three hours long, so you should probably steer clear of it.",7,2,6,11 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The force is just hanging on in this one
","A long time ago in a galaxy not too far away, a young American director created a sci-fi epic which went on to become a cultural icon. A universe was created that captured the imagination of film goers across the globe. And the merchandising that accompanied this mid 70's blockbuster was spectacularly unprecedented. Sequels (and prequels) followed, generating more money than what is probably collectively owed by the Third World. When Disney forked out $US4 billion to own the franchise, it should have come to no surprise to anyone that a shed load of films would follow, along with all the hype, the merchandising, theme park rides, console games and goodness knows what else. The first step in this new journey has been taken, and the first offering for this current generation has been delivered, with predictably stunning financial results, and generally positive reviews.The Force Awakens takes off thirty years following the events of Return of the Jedi. New characters are introduced, along with bringing back most of the now much older favourites from the original trilogy. We see the opening action taking place on a desert planet where the bad guys are desperately searching for a droid that contains plans to a super weapon, which finds itself bouncing around the galaxy with a character who is strong with the force, with Han Solo and Chewbacca along for the rideÂ… Wait a minute, am I talking about the right film here, or am I having de-ja-vu?JJ Abrams did a pretty decent job with his two gigs on the Star Trek franchise, and has produced a visually stunning film in The Force Awakens. The film is pacey, has lots of action, and is quite beautiful to look at. From a technical point of view, this is a very well made movie. John Williams does a fine job with the soundtrack, and there are some decent performances from the cast. There's a lot to like about this film, but on the flip-side, there is a something that was very hard to swallow - it lacks originalityÂ… on a galactic scale.It could be argued (quite successfully) that since growing up with the original trilogy, I have since grown to be old and cranky (something the prequel trilogy has undoubtedly contributed to). I love my sci-fi, and feel aggrieved when I see a lack of originality, poor scripting and generally bad film making. Whilst this is a beautifully made film, the lack of originality is disappointing. Some things I can learn to deal with, but others less so. The parallels between the Force Awakes and the A New Hope I think, short changes fans who have been with the franchise since the very beginning. I do realise that this is a bridging movie, linking the original trilogy with this latest sojourn, but I do feel overwhelmingly that Abrams has played it a little too safe by sticking to an old, and tired formula.With all the talk surrounding the new characters in the lead-up to the release of the film, I felt that we didn't get to see quite enough of Finn, and especially Poe Dameron. Finn is merely introduced into the narrative as a Stormtrooper who flips out and suddenly changes allegiances. If it was his first mission as a Stormtrooper, perhaps the director could have given us a short scene where the First Order are preparing to go into battle, thus allowing the audience to also get a more solid introduction to Captain Phasma, who does look like an interesting character, although one which I assumed had met a grisly death in a rubbish compactor. Kylo Ren originally comes across as a poor man's Darth Vader, with severe anger management issues. I was quite intrigued with him, however, by the end of the film.My favourite part of the whole movie was when Han Solo and Chewbacca walk onto the Millennium Falcon. The encounter with the pirates was also good, and could have been better had it developed into a Mexican stand-off, with Quentin Tarantino hired to direct that one scene. Rey discovering Luke's lightsabre, as remarkably coincidental as it seemed, is a critical juncture in the film, and does lend to the possibility that Rey is in fact, a reincarnation of Anakin Skywalker, as the latest rumours suggest. The remainder of the film is disappointingly predictable, although no medals get handed out this time, Chewbacca might be seriously thinking about how the hell he is supposed to get one! Instead, at the film's conclusion, the 'walking carpet' and Rey take the 'piece of junk' to find Luke Skywalker, in a concluding scene which solidly lays the foundation for episode VIII, and goodness knows how many more films to follow after that. In the meantime, it seems that fans will be treated to the first on the Anthology series in Rogue One, which does look good. Hopefully Forrest Whittaker's appearance in this upcoming sci-fi film proves to be more successful than his last venture in the genre (Battlefield Earth).On a scale of 1-10, I'm giving The Force Awakens a 6. It is beautifully made, with stunning effects, and good performances from the cast, but hopelessly lacking in originality. The powerbrokers at Disney would have been very happy with the film, on account of the starship full of money it has generated, and how it opens itself rather well for many more instalments to follow. Newer fans to the franchise will probably enjoy this movie more than older ones. Hopefully in episode VIII, we get some questions answered along with some better character development. Rian Johnson is helming the next chapter. I don't know much about him, I hope he's up to it. I guess we'll find out at the end of 2017!",Null,1,4,22 April 2016
