Skyfall," After 50 years, James Bond finally comes home!
","Congrats to the production team, especially the writers and the director Sam Mendes, for creating one of the very best Bond movies. If there's any fairness at all in the movie industry, 'Skyfall' will get its fair share of Oscar nominations.THE GOOD:<ul><li>The precredit sequence: They spent almost three months filming this 10 minute sequence. When you see it, you will understand why.</li></ul><ul><li>The lead actors, especially Craig, Bardem and Dench really shine, given a script which has some very interesting plot twists. Especially in the third act, which takes place on British soil entirely.</li></ul><ul><li>Cinematographer Roger Deakins, has made 'Skyfall' the most visually stunning movie of the year. Not since Lewis Gilbert directed Bond movies has a Bond-movie looked this good. Excellent use of colors, light and locations in 'Skyfall'. And no shaky-cam (!) which destroyed the last Bond-movie, 'Quantum of Solace'.</li></ul>THE 'COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER':<ul><li>The huge action setpiece from the beginning of the movie never gets topped during the rest of the movie. Some Bond-fans will probably be disappointed by this, since action set pieces are a key ingredient in the Bond franchise.</li></ul><ul><li>The soundtrack by newcomer Thomas Newman: A bit underwhelming when compared to John Barry, and later David Arnold, who scored the last six Bond-movies. </li></ul><ul><li>The return of the exact same Aston Martin DB5 presented to Bond by 'Q' in 'Goldfinger': I think this messes with the whole 'reboot'-idea.</li></ul>",8,71,140,25 October 2012
The Irishman," No wide cinema release? I understand why.
","Watching the wax museum version of De Niro for more than three hours wasn't the blast I hoped for. The CGI is not there yet. Dead eyes. Very distracting.Al Pacino pretty much tries to play Al Pacino, De Niro his usual bitter self, but nice to see wax-Pesci, who was the most believable character. He completely outshines wax-De Niro here.Oh, and by the way, Scorsese: there were no twin towers in the late 60's.I can rewatch 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' over and over again. I will not be returning to 'The Irishman'",6,400,683,28 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Best of the three...by far!
","Great action scenes and cameos and a nice conclusion to the saga. Part IX didn't drag like the previous two. It's fast paced, fun and has some great drama between the characters.",8,1,8,19 December 2019
Dunkirk," Dunkirk: The Disney version.
","'The best world war 2 movie to date'? Really? As a guy who have been brought up on ww2 movies, I had to attend the first showing. Especially since there were so many 'best ever' headlines. So there I went.This movie is one long action sequence that stretches 106 minutes. But if you deduct the number of times that the exact same situation is shown, but from a different camera angle at another time in the movie, it barely passes the 60 minute mark. And after Hardy shoots down his fourth German plane, a stuka divebombs for the fifth time towards the beach, or Branagh looks up in the sky for the 7th time, it gets repetitive. This actually felt like one long teaser prologue to 'Battle of Britain'. (If the rumors are true that Ridley Scott is doing his take on Battle of Britain, all I can say is: get busy!)In 'Dunkirk' there's almost no dialogue, no conflict between any of the characters, no character development at all and the enemy is completely faceless. So this makes it a rather forgettable movie for me, unlike 'Hacksaw Ridge', 'Saving Private Ryan' and many of the other great world war 2 movies, that show war like it is: bloody. 'Dunkirk' is rated PG-13, which will sure please all the young Harry Styles fans. In retrospective: The 5-minute Dunkirk segment (all shot in one take, an available on You Tube) from the movie 'Atonement' still makes a much larger impression to me, than I think Nolan's first (and hopefully not last) world war 2 movie forever will be doing.But besides that - what Nolan (and collaborator Hans Zimmer) always do really well however is to create suspense, and there are some real nailbiting scenes in there, which make the ticket almost worth it.I left the theater disappointed, though. Expected it to leave a larger impression. It didn't. If you would have preferred 'Titanic' to be a movie that started right when the ship began sinking, 'Saving Private Ryan' to be all about the Omaha beach landing, and 'Braveheart' to be all about the battle of Sterling and Fallkirk, you don't mind cardboard characters, and you often find yourself muttering 'when do they get to the action-part?', then 'Dunkirk' is definitely for you. For people who enjoy movies for emotional context, also: be advised that you won't find it here.",7,178,342,19 July 2017
Avengers: Endgame," 57,4% giving it a 10?
","This I had to see...But oh well, must be all those die-hard Marvel fanboys at it again.Lot's of CGI, green screen and jokes in this SOAP OPERA with way too many characters. And yes, here comes the CGI villain again.It wasn't for me.Captain America: Winter Soldier is still the best Marvel movie.",6,6,10,1 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Predictable and overloaded
","I knew almost all about this movie before I saw it: Superheroes disagree amongst themselves, but must stand together against some CGI villain, This CGI villain is off to destroy a city.... no wait, we've already done that, the World..... no wait, we've done that too, THE UNIVERSE, and the superheroes more less prevail in the end, leaving some sort of cliffhanger though to ensure further profits from the next instalment.Please... a little more orginality next time, Marvel?",6,2,12,27 April 2018
1917," Paperthin script and lacking drama and tension
","Although beautifully shot and a technical masterpiece, '1917' left me dissapointed. Like Nolan's 'Dunkirk' there really isn't any tension between the characters. Guess that warmovies nowadays just have to be a visual spectacle. Like a cutscene from a computergame.And the ending.... so Hollywood. Wrong message there.The shortmovie on YouTube called 'Coward' is a much better and true presentation about what happened in the trenches.",7,2,3,11 March 2020
Once Upon a Time in America," Probably the best movie I have ever seen
","Make sure you watch the 220 minute version which is perfect. The butchered 139 minute version should never have been released and the added faded clips in the much longer 269 minute version aren't worth it.It's not an easy watch. The story builds patiently and jumps back and forth in time, spanning three generations. It's not the usual gangster flick, but a tale of forgiveness, betrayal, greed and nostalgia. The sets, the fantastic score by Morricone, De Niro at the pinnacle of his career.A beautiful epic swan song by the master Sergio Leone this is.",9,2,15,21 January 2020
Inception," Did Michael Bay co-direct this?
","This was a visual treat. A full-blown action movie masked as some sort of intelligent sci-fi. Lots of explosions and people shooting at each other.But no real character development here. No memorable characters. Almost no tension.Christopher Nolan was the guy who directed 'Memento' and reinvented the Batman-franchise, right? What happened here? Instead of sitting on the edge I my seat, I found myself checking my watch. Not good.I expected more than just a lot of cool special effects and Oscar-worthy production design. I expected a gripping story.I left the theater disappointed.",6,11,20,5 August 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," This was not the movie I was looking for!
","And then it begins...A droid lands in a desert carrying a hidden message. It is found by a teenager. And because of the droid it will take this teenager across the universe meeting various characters and finally saving the day from an evil empire and its sinister darkly dressed guy wearing a helmet and its massive weapon that blows up planets.That was Star Wars Episode VI: A New HopeAnd that was what I saw today when watching Star Wars Episode VII.How original...It looks good, though. But I was expecting something else. Like an original plot.",7,17,39,16 December 2015
Spectre," Skyfall on steroids
","A fun, and very much needed joyride, after the more darker Skyfall'.SPECTRE - with its $300 million budget - is probably the most entertaining movie I have seen since Nolan's 'The Dark Knight'Where Skyfall was a revenge-movie with freudian references and plenty of plot holes, SPECTRE, like most Bond-movies, revolves around a current topic. This time it's mass surveillance. Sympathizers of Edward Snowden will probably love this movie for its message.In an interview with Empire magazine, director Sam Mendes, promised that SPECTRE would be 'more panoramic in scope' than Skyfall. And yes, the crowdy Mexico City, the orange lid Rome, the snowy Austrian alps, dusty Morocco: globetrotting Bond is back. And its beautifully shot. It reminded me of the Bond movies helmed by director Lewis Gilbert (You Only Live Twice, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker) which were also grand-scale escapist fun Bond movies and also featured a huge silent henchman and a larger-than life ubervillain. And it reminded me why I became a fan in the first place.There's a LOT going on during its 148 minute runtime. It's extremely fast paced, however never too difficult to follow. There are many huge action setpieces that never drags and several nods to earlier Bond movies. The cast does a great job, as expected, too. Didn't like the score from Thomas Newman, though. It doesn't stand out, like it should, and is too generic, much like his score for 'Skyfall'. I hope they bring David Arnold back for Bond 25.But the action...SPECTRE is without doubt the best actionmovie of 2015. Where 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol' was far better than 'Skyfall' in 2012 as an action movie this time it's vice versa: 'SPECTRE' is vastly superior to 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation', mainly due to the amount of setpieces.Stunt coordinator Gary Powell said about SPECTRE back in July that 'if Skyfall was Sam Mendes' way of getting his feet wet into the Bond franchise, then this one is jumping into the deep end.' And it shows. Although I had minor issues with some of the plot devices in the 3rd act, SPECTRE is overall however a Bond movie that all die- hard will most likely embrace, unlike the much debated Skyfall, which many fans felt veered too widely from the classic James Bond that they know. But with 'SPECTRE'...James Bond is finally back.",8,7,24,26 October 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," More warrior than road
","Hugely disappointed. So Mad Max loses his car two minutes into the movie, and spends almost the rest of the movie driving around the wasteland inside or on top of a tanker with a bunch of supermodels with the lead lady looking like a boy, escaping from a bunch of morons, with the main freak looking like the predator from that Arnold movie?Yeah, yeah... the effects are good - lots of CGI explosions and havoc - like in a Michael Bay movie, but since there's no real story here and Tom Hardy hardly utters a word throughout the movie, I am left to wonder:How the .... did this get 8,5 rating on IMDb?This movie suffers from really, really sloppy storytelling. We know that Max has a backstory because of his flashbacks, and that those flashbacks are a cause of his inner pain. But they are never explained. Who was the little girl that he keeps seeing in his dreams? And where did all the old women on bikes suddenly come from? We never get to learn about anyone in this roadkill, besides the Furiosa women.Buuuh!",5,17,35,26 June 2015
Alien: Covenant," Much better than Prometheus
","This was a great surprise. In this, Fassbender has the most multilayered and fascinating character I've seen in a while in a movie. I see that the motivation for his character's actions is being analyzed on many homepages and forums. Well-written. Can't wait for the final entry in the prequels.",8,3,6,1 August 2017
