The Avengers," A BRILLIANT SUPER HERO FANTASY THRILLER,PERFECT CAST.
","Avengers Assemble is a big budget summer blockbuster that's action packed & perfectly cast, it's so Awesome to see these heroes we all grew up loving on screen together in a big adventure fantasy Thriller!!!Avengers has the right amount of seriousness & light humour, the action scenes are Awesome!!!
It's amazing seeing Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Iron man together fighting side by side & we also have the Awesome Hawkeye & Black Widow joining the fight.The cast is excellent, we have the legendary Samuel l Jackson as Nick Fury the guy who Assembles the Avengers when a threat against earth rises.
Chris Evans is perfect as Steve Rogers aka Captain America he's my favourite of the Avengers team & one of my favourite Marvel characters ever along with The Punisher & Daredevil.
Evans has the perfect balance of lost & weary old school soldier & also in control tough & confident leader when needed, he's a fantastic complex character.
The whole cast is perfect though, Thor is fun, tough & loyal & that's down to a great performance from Chris Hemsworth!!!
Robert Downey Jr is perfect as rich guy super hero Iron man, he's playful, funny & super smart it's a fantastic performance.
Mark Ruffalo is excellent as the big mighty incredible Hulk, another perfect performance bringing nice guy scientist Bruce Banner to life & the big green beast within.
The absolutely beautiful Scarlett Johansson is outstanding as extremely tough & super smart Black Widow, she's extremely Dangerous & extremely brave.
Also we have the excellent marksman Hawkeye played perfectly by Jeremy Renner who is probably my 2nd fave character after Captain America, Hawkeye is a Cool, tough & loyal warrior.
This first Avengers film is truly OUTSTANDING!!!
A big piece of pure fantasy entertainment & a near perfect super hero film.
Director Joss Whedon is a Genius, he writes this BRILLIANT stuff & directs it.",9,2,2,19 August 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," ANOTHER GREAT FANTASY ADVENTURE
","All the pirate's films so far have been Brilliant & i mean BRILLIANT!!! The production design is outstanding, costumes, sets, acting, music & directing all excellent & best of the best & this 4th entry is still full of that quality filmmaking.Although 'On Stranger Tides' is not directed by the legendary Gore Verbinski it's still greatly directed by Rob Marshall. The beautiful attention to detail is there & the gorgeous old fashioned sets are all here full of textured detail & realism, really these films are works of Art!!!
I have yet to see the 5th pirates movie yet & probably my favourite of the franchise so far is 'Dead Man's chest' because i loved the Davey Jones charactor & Mythology & all the sea creatures crew & it's really dark Horror-Gothic look & atmosphere.
Now here with 'On Stranger Tides' we follow Captain Jack Sparrow on his own personal adventure as he searches for the legendary fountain of youth & is accompanied by his old enemy Captain Barbossa played brilliantly by the great Geoffrey Rush, who i absolutely love in this role. Now Elizabeth & Will are not in this film & it's still a great film. We have new characters joining this adventure with Captain BlackBeard played by Ian Mcshane, another great performance, also the beautiful Penelope Cruz as Sparrows true love & an equally cunning & savvy pirate as himself, named Angelica.
The special effects are fantastic as always in this outstanding franchise & one big sequence stands out as the best part of this film & that's the incredible Mermaid scene!!! These Mermaids are the best ever put on screen in my opinion & show the darker mythology of those beautiful singing sirens. The sequence is Amazing, exciting & creepy. All in all this 4th entry is just as much fun & exciting & thrilling as the one's that came before.
ANOTHER great movie in the fantastic franchise & just a whole lot of entertaining fun.
9/10 as i still think that Gore Verbinski is a better director.",9,0,0,30 April 2020
Men in Black 3," A SWEET END TO A FANTASTIC TRILOGY.
","The 3rd part in this wonderful special trilogy is as spectacular & stunning as the first two films!!!
Now i love the 'MIB' films & the 1997 original is my favourite movie ever & part 2 is a fantastic film & both i have watched a ridiculous amount of times over the years & now there's a 3rd film. Part 3 is very good & it's nice to see my childhood heroes again with Agent K & Agent J, i love the magic & chemistry of Smith & Jones & it's still here with the aging stars!!!There's a lovely meaningful heartfelt back story & origins that's explored about Agent K & J.
The performances are excellent especially from Josh Brolin who play's a young K from 1969, his performance is spot-on & perfect & he's having so much fun with the role.
Will Smith is obviously great again & is funny,charming & very heart-warming on screen like seeing an old friend again as i grew up on the MIB films from the very first Classic back in 1997!!!
I absolutely love this franchise/trilogy & have always been a huge fan of Will Smith my childhood hero & idol & once again he's fantastic as Agent J.There's a nice fresh time travel plot & some beautiful production design & sets of Coney island & New York City back in 1969, it looks beautiful.
There's lots of really fun moments & nice characters bits & scenes such as a lovely little scene where the young K sits in a Diner with Agent J & eat pie together & just chat, it's a lovely human scene.
The legendary veteran Tommy Lee Jones is great again as the much older & craggy Agent K & is great on screen although he's not in it all as the younger k takes over the most of the movie but equally excellent.
This film ties it all up nicely & is very enjoyable even if it's not as great as the first two films, there's still alot to like & some good humour & fun along the way, it's a solid 8/10 for me.Boris the Animal is a great designed villain & very funny at times as Well as evil & just a fun monster.
This 3rd part has alot of Heart & is stunning to look at with it's detailed backgrounds & lovely cinematography.
Men in Black 3 is just a beautiful sci-fi action comedy with a big heart",8,1,1,2 August 2019
Gremlins," A BEAUTIFUL FANTASY CHILDHOOD CLASSIC.
","Joe Dante is a brilliant fantasy director & i think Gremlins will always be remembered as his masterpiece!!!I grew up watching Gremlins & it's equally excellent sequel & have been a life long fan of those 2 classic's just like i am of Ghostbusters 1&2 & Predator 1&2.
Gremlins 1984 is a magical,fantasy Horror Comedy that blends all that together perfectly & the gorgeous Christmas setting in the lovely little town of Kingston falls only adds to the magical feel & look of this classic.
Gremlins & Gremlins 2 are very special movies to me & have a special place in my heart & i hold alot of Nostalgia for these lovely films.
I grew up a fan of director Joe Dante & love his movies & grew up watching lots of his on video like Innerspace, Piranha,Matinee,The Howling,Small soldiers but his 2 Gremlins films & his others masterpiece classic The 'burbs 1989 is another very special movie to me & is probably my favourite Joe Dante movie!!!!
Gremlins is the first time i was introduced to the legendary bit-part lovely character actor DICK MILLER & became a huge fan of his thanks to Joe Dante & his movies especially Gremlins 1&2.
An easy 10/10 lovely,fun,dark,fantasy comedy that is very magical.",10,0,1,18 January 2019
The Equalizer," DENZEL WASHINGTON IS FANTASTIC
","I loved 'The Equaliser' & i loved the legendary Denzel in his role as the extremely skilled & dangerous 'Robert McCall' an ex-CIA Agent turned Urban Vigilante. Denzel is one of the greatest actors in cinema history FACT & i grew up watching & loving this guy & over the years he's cranked out some Amazing films such as 'Training Day' & 'Man on Fire' & 'Deja Vu' & 'The Taking of Pelham 123' & 'The Bone Collector' & many, many more films. I'm a fan of Denzel but some of his flicks i didn't like such as 'Inside Man' & 'The Book of Eli' (terrible ending) & '2 Guns' but most of his work is usually excellent with excellent performances.
Here Denzel gives another incredible performance to his big list of great roles!!! McCall is a deadly man but a good man who will stop & help someone in trouble & here set in Boston he gets in deep trouble with the local scum, the Violent Russian gangsters who pimp out young girls & here 'McCall' helps out a young brutalized girl 'Teri' played greatly by Cloe Grace Moretz & comes head to head with a very dangerous man called 'Teddy' played intensely by Martin Csokas, we also have a small role for the excellent Bill Pullman who turns up later in the film.
Director Antoine Fuqua has created a fantastic urban vigilante action Thriller that's exciting, gritty, brutal & fun.
The fact Robert McCall works a regular ordinary job in a hardware store is just genius & grounds everything is a sense of realism.
McCall goes about his violent business cleaning up a dark crime ridden Boston & meets good people as well as bad people.
The Action is brutally fun when McCall starts using his 'Special Skills' on the local thugs & corrupted cops, it's a joy to watch him doing what we would all love to be done in real life!!!
Another excellent Denzel Washington film & role.",9,0,0,2 February 2020
The Expendables 2," ANOTHER EXPLOSIVE WILD RIDE WITH THE EXPENDABLES
","A great follow-up to the Awesome first film, this sequel is much harder & grittier this time around & our team of mercenaries are on a mission of vengeance when one of their team, a new young member played by Liam Hemsworth, is killed on their latest mission by the new villain called 'Vilain' played perfectly by Action legend Van Damme, now he makes a great evil & deadly badguy & a good rival for Stallone but i would've liked him to have been one of the Expendables team members but I'm glad he's here anyway!!! Van Damme does give a gritty, merciless & menacingly cold performance here.
The team are all back in an even more stylised Action Thriller, the look & cinematography is very gritty & harsh & the Awesome theme music blasts as the non-stop thrilling action kicks in.The cast again is great with some new additions with obviously Van Damme but also with the excellent but underrated Scott Adkins as Damme's right hand man 'Hector' & the guy is an Awesome tough as hell villain, there's also a return of the Action king Schwarzenegger back as 'Trench' the other mercenary who often works with Barney Ross, it's a bigger part & just his presence in the film makes it feel more important as an action ensemble piece, we also get Bruce Willis back as the mysterious 'Church' in a bigger part & a great extended cameo by Action veteran Chuck Norris as 'Booker' & with a cast like that it makes me wanna cheer.
This sequel is a blast of adrenaline pumping action & brutal fight scenes, this is a much more fast & furious action Thriller with a very cool fight between Stallone & Van Damme, now the fight is good & well done but not Amazing as you would expect from these two action greats & it's kind of one sided as it's Stallone's film & Van Damme gave up too easily but IT'S a solid fight just not Amazing.
Jason Statham is Awesome once again & works so well with Stallone, if you liked the first film then you will love this sequel.
A great fun wild action packed ride with our old school action heroes!!!",9,0,0,19 January 2020
Deja Vu," A BRILLIANT UNIQUE THRILLER WITH A BRILLIANT DENZEL WASHINGTON
","Another excellent piece of filmmaking from the incredible team of, one of the greatest actors in cinema history, Denzel Washington & one of the best Directors of all time, Tony Scott (R.I.P)When Denzel works with Tony Scott they deliver something very special & create such fun, exciting & thrilling big budget blockbuster popcorn Thriller's such as the excellent Taking of Pelham 123 & the excellent Man on Fire & the excellent Unstoppable.Here the great Denzel Washington gives another great performance as ATF Agent Doug Carlin who is investigating bombings & joins forces with the FBI. 'Deja Vu' is a very stylish Sci-fi Thriller & deals with Time travel as our hero Doug is able to go back in time & try to stop a terrorist attack & save the women he's fallen in love with. It's a crazy story in a way but it's a fantasy sci-fi Thriller so it all works in fine & adds to the Blockbuster fun & popcorn Thriller feel of it all.
Tony Scott has crafted a slick, suspenseful & exciting piece of science fiction with a great lead performance & character portrayed by Washington & an excellent supporting cast with Val Kilmer, Bruce Greenwood, Jim Caviezel, Adam Goldberg & Paula Patton.
Everything in Deja Vu is top notch in the highest quality with stunning cinematography & exciting music & some outstanding action set pieces & one of Denzels best movie characters to follow on his exciting mission.A great movie made by two of the best to do it. Scott & Washington.",9,0,0,27 April 2020
It," GREAT FOR 'STRANGER THINGS' FANS BUT I MUCH PREFER THE 1990 VERSION.
","It the reboot/remake is a very good film but i much prefer the 1990 version,yes i have Nostalgia for that old version but it's also much more darker & way scarier than the new film.
Tim Curry nailed his fantastic performance as the terrifying supernatural Clown pennywise & is totally iconic for that role & scaring the hell outta thousands of kids who grew up in the 90's like myself!!!The new pennywise is more over the top,almost silly & funny but not terrifying like Tim Curry's Pennywise.There's alot of cool & fun stuff in the new film but i just like it all more back in the original,maybe it is all Nostalgia?
Anyway the new flick is made well & has a good creepy atmosphere & a cool bunch of kid actors & there's some great scenes but it does feel like it's made for the 'stranger things' cult phenomena that's taken over? I haven't seen that series but lots say stranger things is very similar to the new it?
Anyway a good solid Horror just not as good as the 1990 Classic.",7,2,3,15 July 2019
Training Day," ONE OF THE GREATEST THRILLERS OF ALL TIME!!! A CLASSIC.
","Training day is a stone cold gritty Classic that's for sure!!! it's perfectly directed & perfectly acted!!! The performances by Denzel Washington & Ethan Hawke are OUTSTANDING!!!This is a gripping cop Thriller & is an instant CLASSIC in my opinion & deserves to be known as a CLASSIC movie.Ethan Hawke gives the performance of his career he's never been better or as powerful in a role as he did as Jake Hoyt!!! His acting was superb you feel how uncomfortable & completely out of his depth as officer Hoyt is & you feel his fear & are scared for him it's truly one of the best performances I've seen in a movie.
And we know how BRILLIANT denzel was as Alonzo Harris he won a well deserved academy award as his performance was so outstanding & created one of the most sinister & evil bad guys in cinema history!!!
Alonzo is a controlling,intimidating & scary as hell corrupted cop character & you hated him but also liked him as he spoke the truth but always twisted it to suit his needs,he's a fantastic villain & a fantastic performance.Training day is an urban cop Thriller that's ridiculously entertaining & gripping from the moody opening to brutal ending this is a cinema great & should be held high as one of the greatest in the 'cop Thriller' genre or in the 'Thriller' genre as it's excellent.",10,0,0,29 April 2019
Inglourious Basterds," ONE HELL OF AN ENJOYABLE WW2 ADVENTURE BY THE LEGENDARY TARANTINO!!!
","Quentin Tarantino is easily one of the greats movie directors of all time!!!
I consider Tarantino to be one of my top 5 fave directors ever along with my number one John Carpenter.
I've loved Tarantino since his blood soaked debut 'Reservoir Dogs' rocked the world way back in the 90's & of course loved 'Pulp Fiction' & his true masterpiece in my opinion the excellent 'Jackie Brown' & his 'Kill Bill' flicks were great fun too if abit over the top & absolute loved his work on 'From Dusk Till Dawn' probably the best Vampire film ever made!!! So yeah Tarantino is great & I'm a big fan.Now down to his war epic adventure 'Inglourious Basterds' it's as expected a fantastically well made & beautifully shot movie, the best of the best from an obsessed movie geek behind the camera & his cast is excellent, even though I'm not a 'Brad Pitt' fan at all & consider him to be one of the most overrated actors in cinema history along with the terrible 'Tom CULT Cruise', pitt is good in his role as the scarred Lt. Aldo Raine & he's funny often & has a thick hillbilly accent but the guy that stands out to me was the incredible casting of Horror Director 'Eli Roth' who plays the baseball bat using big 'Jew Beary' Sgt. Donny Donowitz who is a scene stealer of a role as beats to death deserving Nazi scum, he's great fun & hilarious at times, now the cast is excellent some truly outstanding performances here from the likes of 'Christoph Waltz' & 'Michael Fassbender' & 'Diane Kruger' & 'Melanie Laurent' all incredible performances.This is an Awesome piece of Action adventure Thriller & drama set in Nazi occupied France during WW2 & a team of soldiers 'The Basterds' are sent in behind enemy lines to slaughter & scalp as many Nazi's as possible, there's some Awesome gory scenes & some incredibly intense scenes along with the big pieces of smart & interesting dialogue that Tarantino loves to spill out of his characters!!! It's great entertainment within a work of art piece of filmmaking, Tarantino is a genius!!!
I much preferred this over his 'Kill Bill' films, it's still gritty & savage but fun & entertaining at the same time with beautiful music.
Another Stone cold CLASSIC from a master of Cinema",9,1,2,10 January 2020
Inglourious Basterds," ANOTHER OUTSTANDING CLASSIC FROM THE GENIUS TARANTINO
","Tarantino is a genius, he's probably the greatest director of all time!!!
With each BRILLIANT movie he unleashes we see more into his Awesome movie universe where fact & fiction cross paths & memorable & iconic characters do what we wouldn't love to do in real life!!!
Here Tarantino gifts us with a WW2 man-on-a-mission Thriller that's both full of violent grit & what if fantasy.I absolutely love this film & think IT'S a work of Art & a cinematic instant CLASSIC just like his MASTERPIECE 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' both include beautiful looks & a stunning mix of scary fact & spectacular fiction, here we have a Nazi occupied France & a team of brutal American Nazi-scalp hunters, i love the idea of a bunch of toughs doing to evil Nazi scum what should've happened to the cowards back then but atleast here i get to see some savage justice executed beautifully on screen!!!
We know what the Nazi scum did to the Jews through History so it's Awesome to see some savage killing done to them.The cast is excellent especially the Awesome Eli Roth as the brutal 'Bear Jew' who beats then to death with LOVELY baseball bat, he's called sgt: Donny Donowitz & he's a jew soldier along with the leader of the team Lt. Eldo Raine played by an excellent Brad Pitt & I'm not a Pitt fan at all but he's great fun here as the redneck leader of the 'Basterds' sent to kill & scalp as many Nazi's as possible!!!
The rest of the cast is fantastic with the outstanding Christoph Waltz & Diane Kruger & Melanie Laurent & Michael Fassbender & more it's an incredible cast on screen.
The cinematography is gorgeous & the music is always excellent as with all Tarantino films, this is a kicka## war Thriller with lots of dark humour & also real intense moments & stunningly crafted scenes & the old fashioned 1940's production design is phenomenal in it's look & detail, we get a bloody quest of vengeance but also a beautiful story of a young Jewish girl who escaped the Nazi's & opened up a beautiful Cinema but smartly plots her revenge on the Nazi's that killed her family, there's the beautiful what if? Final showdown scene that is in it's self a rip roaring exciting & incredibly uplifting sequence that we can all only wish really did happen!!!
The movie is one of the greats of cinema & is an instant classic, Tarantino knows how to tell a wild story that is totally entertaining & totally engrossing & transports you to that fantasy world of his with his incredible characters.
Thank you again Mr. TARANTINO
you make films important works of Art that we can go back to over & over again.",9,0,2,16 January 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," BRILLIANT!!! A MORE GRITTY DARKER STAR WARS FILM.
","BLOWN AWAY is what comes to mind with Rogue One as yes i grew up on the Star wars franchise but this movie is a more grown up & darker in tone & actually gritty & a real sense of danger so to me it's actually as great as the classic's.The group of rebels are excellent & the story is exciting & dangerous so the atmosphere is very dark & often emotional!!!
A fantastic sci-fi Thriller not just a great star wars movie as this is a brilliant sci-fi film that's excellently directed & it looks amazing.A rag tag group of rebels are on a deadly suicide mission to destroy the Death Star & that's the story but so much happens & there's so much action & stunning set pieces that makes this a visual pleasure to watch.Yes the other movies are of course iconic classic's but this is an instant CLASSIC & a brilliantly crafted sci-fi adventure/Thriller with meaning & a much more urgent excitement feel to it & in my opinion a better more grown up star wars film & a perfect film in the franchise.",8,3,6,10 February 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT SEQUEL & AS GOOD AS THE CLASSIC FIRST FILM
","What a fantastic sequel to a Classic.
'Dead Man's chest' is another Masterpiece like the first film by the brilliant visionary director Gore Virbinski, a stunning piece of filmmaking with some of the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie!!!
This time Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner & Elizabeth are mixed up with the Mystery & Legend of Davey Jones Locker & what we get is an Amazing swashbuckling, Cannibal, Jungle & sea creatures action adventure flick.
The look of the slimey octopus mutant Davey Jones is just amazing & his sea creatures mutated crew all look fantastic & scary & so richly detailed they are a work of Art.
The first time we meet the Deep sea monster crew is an incredible sequence that feels like a Horror movie it's done so well with such a creepy atmosphere, i loved it.The performances are all great again & Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow was actually better this time around as he was toned down i felt with his bizarre ways & it was better.
Orlando Bloom is great again as the real action hero of the movie Will Turner & his beautiful bride-to-be Elizabeth played by Keira Knightley is funny & cunning. The real star of this show goes to the Amazing performance of the main monster himself Davey Jones performed & voiced by Bill Nighy under alot of c.g.i effects but an incredible creation.Dead Man's chest is a such a fun & beautiful looking Gothic monster movie with beautiful cinematography & richly textured & detailed sets & characters.
One of the best Adventure films ever made in my opinion. Another Masterpiece that's a joy to watch over & over again.",10,0,0,16 April 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL OLD FASHIONED FANTASY GHOST STORY ADVENTURE
","This is the best of the 'Pirates' franchise & one of the greatest fantasy-adventure films ever made.
I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen way back in 2003 upon it's release & i loved it & still do in 2020!!!'The Curse of the Black Pearl' is a fantastic piece of filmmaking as well as a big summer blockbuster film, everything from the absolutely stunning production design & outstanding special effects to the Amazing music score & excellent performances are all perfect & put together created a Masterpiece.Simple-basic story is about a famous pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) who teams up with a young Blacksmith named Will Turner (Bloom) who set sail on a thrilling adventure to rescue the princess Elizabeth (Knightley) & battle the Evil supernatural pirates lead by Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) & all hell breaks loose. That's the basic plot but of course there's lots more going on with Magic Medallions & Zombies & Battles & a whole lot of Fun.I loved all the performances here, especially the heroic turn as Will Turner played by Orlando Bloom, i liked his character more than Captain Jack Sparrow (which everyone became obsessed with?) Now Bloom is everybit the handsome & willing fighter out to save his true love Elizabeth. Depp is silly & fun as Jack Sparrow & very bizarre but good fun & Keira Knightley is great as the quick thinking & beautiful Elizabeth but who really steals the show here in my opinion is the fantastic Geoffrey Rush as the Evil, Funny & Cunning Captain Bambosa, he's a hilarious villain with such a great voice & it's the standout performance here for me.
The supernatural Zombie pirates look Amazing on screen with truly stunning special effects that make the pirates look scary rather than comical as you might expect from a big budget Disney production, here everything looks spectacular.
The ships are so richly textured & beautifully detailed as is all the costumes & fantastic sets, all the best quality possible.The Curse of the Black Pearl is truly a rip-roaring, swashbuckling fantasy adventure full of fun & magic.
An instant CLASSIC & a film that be watched over & over again.",10,0,0,6 April 2020
Hostel," EXCELLENT FOLLOW UP TO THE CULT CLASSIC 'CABIN FEVER' IT'S A SAVAGE SHOCKER!!!
","Hostel is an excellent follow up to 'Cabin Fever' the cult classic dubut of Director Eli Roth.
With his 2nd movie Roth has created a terrifying eastern Europe nightmare world, but this stuff does go on all around the world that's a fact, anyway 3 backpackers are travelling around Europe & end up in a beautifull luxury Hostel that is a front for an evil institution of torture for money & it's brutally played out & set up by the excellent Roth.What eli roth has shown here is the evil of the world, the evil that men do & the dark sadistic real world we live in, this stuff happens in real life!!!
I totally agree with Roth, nothing he could put in a Horror film could ever compare to the real Horrors of the world!!!
The world is darker & more sick & twisted than any Horror film could ever try to be & that's the truth, we exist in a living nightmare where the absolute worst things happen to women, Children & men.
It's a very scary world out there & Roth has put that fear on screen, especially that fear Americans have of foreign places & that completely out of your comfort zone is what he plays on with the creepy atmosphere & use of gradually draining all the colour out of the film as it gets more dangerous for our group of backpackers!!!!I loved 'Cabin fever' & it's one of my favourite movies of all time & Hostel is an excellent follow up movie,
although completely different it's still exciting & you can feel that Roth has lovingly crafted this movie too just like he did with Cabin Fever.
The musical score is beautiful & exciting by 'Nathan Barr' & the look & cinematography is excellent.The stand out performance is definitely 'Jay Hernandez' he's excellent as Paxton the party womanizer friend, who ends up being a tough smart hero & turns the tables on the hunters.
Now i did like the characters better in 'Cabin fever' as that group of kids were alot of fun & 'Rider Strong' was excellent as 'Paul' but it's still a well paced, exciting sinister survival Horror.ELI ROTH is a fantastic Horror director as he knows the genre so well so with his first two films 'Cabin Fever' & 'Hostel' he really gives you brilliantly made movies for that genre & he still hasn't beaten those 2 films or the impact they had.
Hostel is brutally savage survival shocker with disgusting & disturbing scenes of gore & torture but it's all worth it to see Paxton (Hernandez) get some well deserved revenge later on in the movie!!!
Hostel is an excellent shocking survival Horror film & one that really brought back the blood & guts to Horror back in 2005.
Hostel is great but doesn't beat his first blood soaked masterpiece 'Cabin Fever' (2002).",9,3,5,1 April 2019
Happy Gilmore," GREAT SANDLER FUN & DEFINITELY ONE OF HIS BEST FILMS
","Adam Sandler was abit of a Hero to me during the late 90's & early 2000's when he was at his blockbuster best knocking hit after hit out!!!I loved Big Daddy, The WaterBoy, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Bulletproof, Anger Management & Mr.Deeds, the guy was on fire as a goofy lovable but angry big kid & everyone loved him.'Happy Gilmore' was one of his that i got in video the same time i got his 'Billy Madison' as both got re-released with the massive hit 'Big Daddy' when it came out to buy, Adam Sandler is a comedy genius & his films are great fun with lots of hilarious scenes & hilarious cameos by anyone that Sandler is friends with at the time.
Although Sandler now has dropped massively with the quality of his films & he's no longer a 'Big movie star' as he's had his day, we can still go back & watch with great Nostalgia his Comedy greats from his long Career.'Happy Gilmore' is pure Adam Sandler gold, he's here the type of angry & sarcastic character he would be known to play in nearly all his films but that's fine as that's his 'thing' & as Happy Gilmore he's great fun to watch as he takes on a Golf tournament to try to win & collect the big pay-off at the end & buy back his grandmother's house, that's basically the story & a fun set-up for all the craziness that happens. Gilmore always wanted to be a Hockey player but kept getting benched for being to aggressive & fell into the world of Golf by chance with his powerful swing & he meets his soon to be manager 'Chubbs Peterson' a hilarious little role for the action hero actor Carl Weathers, also we get a slimy little cameo from another Comic great Ben Stiller & one of the best & funniest Comedy villains ever with 'Shooter McGavin' a slimy & brilliant Christopher McDonald.This is a goofy feelgood summertime Comedy with lots of laugh out loud moments & an on Fire Comic performance by the legendary Adam Sandler as Happy Gilmore!!!
This is definitely one of his greatest & most beloved movies, we who grew up in the 90s loved this flick & still do.",8,0,0,11 February 2020
Us," ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS, I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED
","I loved 'Get Out' it was excellent but 'Us' was absolutely ridiculous!!!!The beginning was very good & well done & then the 'Clones' come & the film died!!!
The revelation is absolutely ridiculous leaves so many Questions it made me angry!!!
Also the performances were terrible especially the annoying joker dad played by Winston Duke, he helped ruin the film too as he tried to be 'Funny' all the time & didn't take the situation serious at all!!!
The film was a massive let down & i was genuinely gutted by the end, oh & the 'Surprise' ending was again ridiculous & left too many Questions again!!!
The director tried to be too smart & destroyed the film as it turned out just stupid, made no sense & was ridiculous, a big shame as i loved 'GET OUT' so much & the start of 'Us' was excellent but went stupid & made no sense & oh my there was so many unanswered questions",1,1,1,10 December 2019
Knives Out," A MURDER MYSTERY MASTERPIECE
","I loved this AWESOME ensemble cast, murder mystery thriller, the talent is mega here with a huge cast of fantastic actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween franchise,The Fog) & Daniel Craig (James Bond) & Chris Evans (Captain America) & Ana De Armas (Knock Knock) & Michael Shannon (Man of Steel) & Don Johnson (Machete) & Toni Collette (Hereditary) & to top the rest ensemble off with Lakeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, Jaeden Martell & Movie Legend Christopher Plummer!!!! A hell of a great cast.The exciting, interesting & super smart story is about a renowned crime novelist Harlin Thrombey (an excellent Christopher Plummer) is found dead at his huge mansion estate just after his 85th birthday & a Brilliant & debonair private Detective Benoit Blanc (a Brilliant Daniel Craig) is mysteriously enlisted to investigate. From the crazy & dysfunctional family & his devoted staff, Blanc has to sift through a huge web of red herrings & self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's death. Each actor brings so much richness & detail to their character, it's a beautiful piece of filmmaking in my opinion with a truly stunning setting with the massive mansion setting that is just beautiful, old looking & richly detailed & a place you would want to explore, the look of this movie is gorgeous too with a lovely cozy look & set during the Autumn & simply lovely cinematography. The real knockout performance here is from the beautiful Ana De Armas, this lady is truly a phenomenal actor who really carries to the whole movie & interacts with everyone of the huge ensemble cast of characters & holds it all together perfectly, her performance is fantastic as she struggles to help others & keep secrets & its a great performance. I was also really impressed by Chris Evans as he's moved onto such a different role than what we know him as (Captain America) & it's a fun part from a guy who is only really known for his Marvel movies work, he's a great actor here. This is also the best I've seen Daniel Craig in a film, he's excellent here as the smart Colombo type Detective with a deep southern accent, another great performance. Jamie Lee Curtis is another legend of Cinema & as usual she's great here & alot of fun, always been a Jamie lee Curtis fan since i grew up watching the Halloween films & The Fog. The whole cast is terrific fun & the movie is a huge piece of entertaining fun & with a real cozy atmosphere.
A perfect late night murder mystery Thriller that really the whole family can enjoy as it's loaded with dark funny humour & wacky characters. Loved it.",10,0,1,2 July 2020
The Mummy," THE DEFINITION OF THE SUMMER POPCORN MOVIE
","I remember seeing this in the cinema way back in the Awesome 90s & it blew my mind & i still think it's excellent & holds up fantasticly with it's excellent fx & Awesome cast.
1999's The Mummy is the best film in the franchise as the others just became boring & lost the perfect tone of Action-fantasy Horror & comedy.
The sequels are just not very good at all but this first film is a fantastic adventure with the once leading man Brendan Fraser at his absolute best as our funny but tough lead hero 'Rick O'Connell' who is such a great old fashioned character & hero!!!
Brendan Fraser is so COOL here with his many guns & funny wisecracks & handsome charm he's such an all American movie hero, think a little Indiana Jones & Han Solo & any explorer hero from 50's B-movie flicks!!!
'The Mummy' is full of adventure & the special fx look Amazing, the mummy itself is fantastic & scary but done fun at the same time, i love this film.
Also at times this is like a Horror movie with Zombies, Mummies, Killer bugs & demonic followers & the 'Book of the Dead' i mean this could be a prequel to the fantastic 'Evil Dead' Trilogy!!!
A great little cast with the BEAUTIFUL Rachel Weisz & the posh bumbling John Hannah & the cool but intimidating Arnold Vosloo as the main Mummy monster 'Imhotep' it's a good cast.
I love the Egyptian locations & all the creepy dark underground tunnels & corridors under the pyramids, there's such a fun sense of Adventure & wonder here & there's lots of great scenes or moments, there's some Awesome creepy bits too that lead into the Horror Genre at times & the production design is Amazing as is the music!!!
Another great film from the 90's & still the absolute best Mummy film of them all.
There's loads to enjoy in this Adventure of great entertainment that mixes Adventure,Horror,Fantasy & Comedy together perfectly.
One of the most enjoyable Adventure films of all time!!!
This is what movies were made for, to take you on an exciting fantasy adventure & give you escapism from the depressing real world.",10,0,0,1 January 2020
Terminator Salvation," A FUN SCI-FI THRILLER & A FUN POPCORN FLICK
","I really enjoyed 'Terminator Salvation' it's way better than 'Terminator 3' which i think is the worst film in the Terminator franchise but it's not as much fun as 'Terminator Genisys' which i really enjoyed but all in all the Terminator franchise is a good one in my opinion.
Christian Bale is really good as John Connor even if he feels abit miscast but hey so was Sam Worthington, i think that's only because i was used to seeing him as Batman or in big weighty dramatic roles but he's still a good solid serious & intense action hero here because he's such an excellent actor, we also have the then 'next big thing' of the time Sam Worthington who was the lead in James Cameron's sci-fi epic 'Avatar' & because of him being pushed as the next big star i think he was dropped quickly into big budget blockbuster films such as this Terminator film & the huge fantasy adventure Clash of the Titans & here Mr. Worthington if ok but nothing special as just like his other lead roles he's actually a very bland actor to lead a big movie but Hollywood loved him at that time but his fire very quickly died out & he's mostly stars in DTV flicks now.'TERMINATOR SALVATION' is an action packed sci-fi Thriller with excellent special fx & lots of Terminators this time & an Awesome looking apocalyptic landscape, the look is gritty & 'Mad Max' style, a solid good cast & good music score, i enjoyed this film & it's a good film in the franchise, a big budget sci-fi action popcorn flick with some stunning shots of an apocalyptic landscape & there's a real grittiness to the look & feel.",7,0,0,12 January 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," BRILLIANT JUST LIKE THE FIRST TWO FILMS
","WOW, This 3rd entry in the fantastic Pirates franchise is, once again another fantastic piece of filmmaking.
'At Worlds End' is an extravaganza of an adventure epic with an incredible richly textured & detailed world beautifully created & crafted.This time we have the main gang back together & some other new members as they are on a mission to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from Davey Jones Locker. The adventure is epic in scale & absolutely beautiful to look at, a Visual treat just like the first two films. Gore Verbinski is a visionary director & a great one.
The characters are even more explored here & there's so many amazing set pieces & stunning sequences it's another instant Classic in the franchise.The universe of the Pirates is such an exciting, dangerous & mysterious place to explore full of danger, myths & legends. The exciting Davey Jones is given so much more depth for his character here & he once again looks Amazing. Theres lots of Twists & turns & unexpected moments in this film that kept it exciting the whole way til the surprising ending.
A beautiful fantasy adventure full of great characters & Amazing cinematography.
The great cast has expanded here with the likes of the legendary Chow Yun Fat, Geoffrey Rush, Reggie Lee & even Keith Richards.Another great blockbuster popcorn movie",10,0,0,24 April 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," A HILARIOUS FANTASY ADVENTURE MARVEL MASTERPIECE
","Thor:Ragnarok is an utterly hilarious fantasy adventure & the third part of the Thor Trilogy, Thor has become probably my favourite Avenger, i love Captain America & Hawkeye but Thor is just as great & is so much fun.The comedy here is perfect, perfect moment comic timing, the funny buddy chemistry between Thor & Hulk is so much fun & makes me want more adventures with these guys!!!Ragnarok is a massive budget, beautiful looking Marvel MASTERPIECE along with The Winter Soldier, Civil War, Avengers Assemble,
Avengers:Age of Ultron, Avengers:infinity wars & Avengers:End Game, i believe these to be the best movies of the MCU & are the 'Marvel Masterpieces' in my opinion.
This 3rd Thor adventure is full on action-packed fun & full of beautiful production design & amazing sets & stunning special fx, there's so many hilarious moments that is was a total joy sitting through this movie, Chris Hemsworth is a hilarious guy & here he gives it his all & gifts us with his greatest performance as Thor & he's absolutely amazing!!!
A great new hero & character comes in the form of hard drinking & tough as nails warrior 'Valkyrie' who's played fantasticly by Tessa Thompson, she's Awesome & a great new friend & hero to help Thor.
The incredible 'Hulk' is perfectly played once again by Mark Ruffalo, he's hilarious & does some amazing fight scenes & some funny as hell behaviour bits & great scenes.
Bad brother 'Loki' is great in this movie, he's still slimey & sneaky but much more fun & silly & has some really funny bits throughout & shows he's still got a heart after all & does love his brother 'Thor', a great performance by Tom Hiddleston.
Even veteran actor Jeff Goldblum is here as a hilarious games master called 'Grandmaster' & he's great.
The always excellent but underrated Karl Urban has a good role as 'The Executioner' a good guy who turns to the darkside for abit but not by choice & comes back fighting for Asgard, Urban is a great actor & starred in one of the greatest comic book films ever MADE & that's 'Dredd' he was outstanding as Judge Dredd.Ragnarok has a huge cast of great actors & great characters, we also have Cate Blanchet as the evil villain of this movie 'Helena' & there's Idris Elba who ruturns as 'Heimdall' old friend of Thor, actor legend Anthony Hopkins returns in a small role as father 'Odin' & a great new hilarious character joins the wacky cast 'Korg' a soft speaking rock monster who becomes a friend of Thor's & he's hilariously voiced by the director of this film Taika Waititi, lots of fun & adventure spilling out of this film.The music is excellent & very retro 80s style, the movies cinematography is stunning with popping colourful imagery & beautiful detail, this is easily the best 'Thor' movie & easily one of the greatest 'Marvel' movies ever made & an instant CLASSIC comic book movie!!!
This sets the bar so high for comic book movies & fantasy adventure films, this has it all.",10,2,16,15 September 2019
Silent Hill," EXTREMELY DARK, DISTURBING & ATMOSPHERIC, A HORROR CULT CLASSIC
","I have never played the 'Silent Hill' games so i just make my opinion purely on the movie & oh my, this is a fantastic Nightmare world covered in falling ash.
Silent Hill is a Classic of the Horror genre in my opinion!!! It's full of suspense & has a thick,dark,gloomy Atmosphere that i haven't seen done that well since John Carpenter's CLASSIC 'The Fog' (1980)!!! With 'The Fog' it was obviously a thick creeping Fog bank rolling through that small coastal town & here it's also thick fog that's engulfed the town as well as thick white/grey falling ash from it's eternal burning from the under ground & it's done visually stunning!!! The town look is really eerie with it's Smokey-misty-fog, like the early morning look in the winter when that cold mist has engulfed everything, superb cinematography.
The 'Dark' that comes is seriously scary as a black nightmare takes over the old abandoned town & twisted nightmare creatures stumble out of the darkness!!! It's as affective as it sounds on screen & it's here this movie moves into pure Horror territory with it's twisted-gothic set design, it looks scarily Awesome & the creature fx are Amazing!!!
The back story of the little girl is so sad & disturbing & extremely dark, it's a scary well told slow-burner Horror that really lets the Horror unfold & doesn't rush into easy jump scares.
'Silent Hill' gets under your skin with it's raw bleakness,
I personally think 'Silent Hill' is a modern Horror masterpiece, it atleast deserves Cult Classic status but personally i think it's more powerful than that & with it's stunningly detailed sets it's TRULY a work of ART within the Horror genre.We also have an excellent lead in 'Radha Mitchell' as Rose & she's a great fearless character to follow into this nightmare world of Silent Hill. Radha gives an excellent performance & is completely different from other screaming final girl type women in the Horror genre, here Rose is strong,tough,smart & has bigger balls than most men lol as she searches this evil place full of tortured, demonic creatures whilst looking for her daughter, she's a tough mother.
'Laurie Holden' is equally excellent in her role as tough & smart no nonsense Cop 'Cybil Bennett', a great strong performance.The music score/soundtrack is a masterpiece in itself, full of tension & mood & very atmospheric.Silent Hill is stunning visually & creepy as hell with some awesome nightmarish monsters roaming around, this makes a great Horror film setting & a unique new Horror world to explore!!!
The sequel 'Silent Hill:Revelation' is also very good & does expand & explore more into this nightmare world but it doesn't beat this first cult classic.
Forget the other's comparing it to the video game as i haven't ever played a 'Silent Hill' game & i loved it purely as a Horror movie!!!",9,2,3,14 July 2019
The Hateful Eight," A FANTASTIC SNOW-FILLED MURDER MYSTERY
","I loved it , now my best will always be 'Reservoir Dogs' & that's his 'MASTERPIECE' but oh my this was great fun!!!
I loved the long & slow relaxed storytelling & interesting & strange characters, i love Kurt Russell & Samuel L Jackson & Bruce Dern!!!
A fantastic superb cast of talent involved.
The Hateful 8 is a long wild ride through the thick snowy countryside & further, the cold atmosphere is exciting & fun & full of mystery!!!
The dialogue is excellent & smart as usual for the genius Tarantino & his mix of strange characters are given full room to breathe & play out.
The performances are great especially from Kurt Russell & Samuel L Jackson!!! Both are on top form & are fantastic on screen.
Yes Kurt Russell is excellent & Samuel L Jackson is excellent, these two performances are the best in the film in my opinion, but hell the cast is superb all around!!!At times this movie definitely feels like it's Going into the Horror genre & feels very 'Evil Dead' at times when the stage is set up at the stagecoach stopover where different travellers are taking refuge from a major blizzard.
There's an exciting who's gonna turn on who feel to it & a sense of doom, each character is given room to shine & when it gets bloody it gets bloody, old school brutal violence explodes accross the screen.
I loved the beautiful cinematography & the old school music score, this is top notch film making by a master at his most relaxed & confident.This is basically in a way Tarantino's 'The Thing' but set around Civil War times & without an Alien but the mood, look, Atmosphere, music & the presence of the legendary Kurt Russell is just like 'The Thing'
This movie is truly OUTSTANDING in every single aspect, Tarantino has created his Cinematic Masterpiece.An excellent post civil war wintertime mystery adventure Thriller full of mood,atmosphere & great performances.",9,2,5,7 December 2019
The Expendables," ACTION RESURRECTION
","I grew up watching & loving all the Action movies from the 80's & 90's & loved all the Action stars, especially the king of Action 'Schwarzenegger' & 'Stallone' & 'Van Damme' & 'Snipes' among others, so i was so excited to hear that Stallone was getting the old school action heroes back together for a big budget project. The Expendables brought together some legends with himself Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Mickey Rouke & some other greats such as Jason Statham, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Steve Austin, Gary Daniels & Eric Roberts. That's an impressive cast of Action stars & Stallone delivered an Action packed brutal Thriller made in the mould of the 80's & 90's Action style, the blood flows as explosions & bullets fly accross the screen in an Action frenzy, it's such a fun movie & feels Nostalgic because of it's look, feel & actors!!!Stallone & Statham make a great duo & have such fun chemistry & banter, the basic simple action story is the wild bunch of mercenaries known as the 'Expendables' are on a mission to stop an evil latin American dictator & a corrupt ex- CIA agent (Roberts) & what unfolds is non-stop brutal & bloody old school action with plenty of Manley gritty moments & Awesome fight scenes & brutal shootouts & Stallone is excellent as the leader of his rag tag team 'Barney Ross' so if you grew up on the old Action stuff like i did from way back on video, then you will love this!!!
Great little cameos from Schwarzenegger & Bruce Willis too.
Jason Statham probably is the best here & steals the show but it's great to see all my childhood heroes back & together, it's an Action resurrection & a blast of Nostalgia but in a new time for movies!!!
My heroes are ageing but can still kick ass.The Expendables is an action blast of old school justice.",9,0,0,19 January 2020
Final Destination 2," THE BEST OF THE FRANCHISE.AN EXCITING,FUN,GORY HORROR-THRILLER.
","Final Destination 2 is the best film in the whole franchise in my opinion,i was lucky enough to see this at the cinema back in 2003!!!This gory as hell sequel is so much fun,it's smart & thrilling & exciting so much more than the first film which was ok to good but nothing special.
FD2 packs more ferocious,spooky atmosphere into an exciting rollercoaster ride that is pure Horror-thriller entertainment.The cast of survivors is a better & more interesting bunch of characters this time around & none of them are too annoying & all give fine little performances for a fun-Thriller like this.
This film also has the best & most terrifying scene in the franchise,the pile-up car crash on the motorway.
That sequence is terrifying & probably the most iconic & memorable scene in the entire franchise.Final Destination 2 is basically just good gory-fun,a good night's entertainment especially if your a Horror genre fan like myself!!!
The kills are creative & brutal & the film itself feels better made than the others in the franchise & I'm fine only owning this film from the series because it's easily the best one.
Yes i have Nostalgia for it but i also saw the first film way back on video first & even then i thought it's ok but no need to watch it again.Just sit back with a nice hot cup of Coffee one evening & stick on Final Destination 2. It's a real Gem from an otherwise just ok franchise.",8,2,3,9 July 2019
Suicide Squad," LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH & WILL SMITH AS DEADSHOT WAS EXCELLENT
","FORGET all the silly way over the top & unnecessary Hate this movie has gotten as it's NO WHERE near as bad as it's made out to be!!! First off it's a really fun action packed & really good stunning visual looking blockbuster movie, You can pick bits apart i get that & it may not be absolutely perfect as there is some small faults, but no movie is perfect these days because everyone picks films apart so much that no one just sits back & enjoys the fun entertainment especially with a movie like this, SUICIDE SQUAD is big flashy Cool entertainment & i loved it, i have watched it so many times it's become one of my favourite movies of all time, in my top 5.
SUICIDE SQUAD has also become regular viewing at home with my family, we all love it.Now it's not absolutely perfect & there are bits that Don't make sense but overall there's too much good stuff in this film that those bits Don't really matter!!! The good stuff definitely out weigh it's flaws for me.
One silly bit is the eyeball creatures, that are not very well created, they look silly & totally not scary or threatening & they die way too easily they literally crumble if you hit one hard enough so they are useless bad guys but Enchantress & her big god like brother Incubus, are both fantastic creations.We all have different tastes as 'Deadpool' i hated, so yeah we all have different tastes with movies & Suicide Squad hit everything i like some how!!!
I'm used to loving films most boring critics hate so that doesn't bother me at all especially after them raving on about how great 'Deadpool' is when in my opinion it's one of the worst films I've ever seen it's Terrible.Suicide squad introduced me to a darker edgier corner of the DC universe & one i much prefer & that's why Suicide squad is one of my favourite comic book films ever, probably my favourite.
The characters are all great in their own unique way & style, the movie had a throwback dark fantasy feel to it like that of 'Escape from New York' (1981) & 'Blade Runner' (1982) like a retro neo-noir look & style that completely satisfies me watching it's magnificent visual style, there's a dark gloomy grungy & almost Cyberpunk look to the film & i loved it. Also the main thing is the Team are a bunch of Great characters that i enjoy spending time with. We all see movies differently & that's ultimately what makes us decide if we like something or not & i absolutely loved, Suicide Squad as my opinion is formed by how i feel about a film & if i loved the characters & here i definitely loved the team & Deadshot blew me away & has become one of my favourite characters ever in any medium.There's so many great scenes & moments that make this so special, i TOTALLY adore this movie & love all the characters but especially 'DEADSHOT' he's fantastic, my favourite actor is Will Smith & here he didn't disappoint at all, he created one of his best characters & roles of his excellent career & Deadshot needs his own movie.
SMITH gives an emotional & thoughtful performance as the hitman with a heart & troubled mind, really he's the heart & soul of the movie & is so good at grounding all the fantasy action with some grit & heart!!! So SMITH is Excellent & i loved all these touching little scenes with his daughter, Deadshot is such an interesting character that i want to see more of!!! I need his own movie & really explore his dark world more!!!
Deadshot is now one of my favourite movie characters of all time & my favourite DC character.
Also another great thing about this movie is the excellent Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag & his chemistry with will smith's Deadshot but Kinnaman stands out as a great actor & intense screen presence, i love this guy & think he's the best of the new wave of actors out there!!! He's great as the new Robocop & excellent in Run All Night & outstanding in The Informer he's one of my faves!!!also Margot Robbie is great as the crazy but fun Harley Quinn, she is a fantastic actor & completely becomes the character to perfection!!! The other team member characters are absolutely fine & work well together especially DIABLO, played perfectly by JAY HERNANDEZ, a great performance & A big part of why this movie is so good, big mention to WILL & MARGO again though because they really steal the show more on a deeper level with lots of emotional moments that are great, the villain is also great, people hated Enchantress but i loved the demonic ancient witch, she was so cool & visually Awesome to see plus the city scenes look beautiful too, excellent cinematography. Also the music is really great through the film.So yeah one hell of a good ride with great music throughout & an exciting atmosphere, so i don't get all the hate at all? But hey we all have our own opinions!!! I had NEVER heard of suicide squad until this movie or the BRILLIANT 'deadshot' so I'm not a fan boy maybe that's why i loved it more as i took it completely for what it was? I thank this excellent film for introducing me to these characters especially DEADSHOT my favourite & thank you WILL SMITH for your great performance!!! Great film just enjoy it, i haven't gone on about the plot or story because loads have in great detail so here i am just honestly telling all i LOVE this movie & even with it's faults. This Anti-hero flick is ridiculously entertaining & rewatchable. A fantasy Thriller that has a gritty & grimy neon drenched look & the imagery of the empty city is beautiful & very 80s style, again BEAUTIFUL cinematography with a fantastic music score, A really well directed film with a great atmosphere of dark fun & humour, very stylish.
Also Joker was excellent even if it's a small part it's still a solid part of an overall bigger story & Jared Leto was excellent in all his incredible scenes.
I also loved the inclusion of Ben Affleck as Batman, he's the greatest Batman ever in my opinion & including him in a few small scenes was an Awesome idea as he connects all the rich comic book history & it's universe. There's so many great bits to this movie that i just enjoy it all for what it is.I honestly think Director David Ayer done an excellent job considering all the tampering by the Studio & I'm not the only one who thought so as Deadshot himself, Will Smith went straight on to work with him again on the, also underrated fantasy Thriller Bright a Netflix original movie, another great film by the visionary Director!!!
Some scenes are really great in Suicide Squad, such as the opening introduction scenes to each character, especially Deadshot's scene it's Awesome. All the subway/station scenes with big warrior monster Incubus are excellent & full of Horror atmosphere. To be honest i think Deadshot steals the show & every single scene he appears in because Will Smith is such a good actor & a powerful screen presence, most of the best scenes involved Deadshot such as the excellent Gun-range training scene where he shows his Amazing shooting skills & deadly Aim. I also loved the scenes in the rain when the gang head in to an abandoned bar for a drink it's a nice group scene of talking, bonding & opening-up, a good character moment. Probably the most fun & exciting & action packed sequence is the gun-blazing 'Ally way battle' when the Squad & soldiers first encounter the 'Eye Creatures' & Deadshot pretty much shoots them all to bits as he stands on top of a car, it's a spectacular action sequence & sets in stone just how Dangerous & how Cool Deadshot is. The Squad all seem to look to Deadshot for their next move as if he's the leader & i liked that. The big battle with Enchantress at the end is an Epic special effects spectacle & really looks fantastic & a powerful last shot by Deadshot aiming while drenched in the pouring rain & a beautiful piece of music that enhances the scene to really get the emotions going, an epic scene.Love SUICIDE SQUAD & will continue to watch it more & more, it's made my all time top 10 fave movies,
The reason it got rated a 9/10 is because it sits just under an 'Instant Classic' or 'MASTERPIECE' because there is some faults with it, it's not perfect but it's still one hell of a fun ride with a great Squad of characters & will definitely become a FUTURE CULT CLASSIC I'm sure.",9,0,3,21 July 2018
Taxi Driver," A MASTERPIECE & ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS IN CINEMA HISTORY.
","What can be said that hasn't already been said & researched & talked about & obsessed over when it comes to a true pure CLASSIC of cinema history as Martin Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER.This is Scorsese's Masterpiece without a doubt this is also the greatest movie he has ever made.Robert De Niro gives one of the greatest performances to ever grace the screen in the history of cinema & created a character so lost & damaged that he can be so easily relatable as even I've felt like his character Travis Bickle many times as our world is full of evil people & scum ruling the streets & a joke of a justice system so it's so easy to feel that rage & pure anger & hatred for what's happening all around us & we can't do anything!!!
So yes Travis Bickle is a legendary classic movie character who i personally can identify with.The sleazy crime filled gutter called New York City of the 70's is gritty & raw on screen & with all the hussle & bussle you can see how Travis would be completely lost in this grimy city of sin.
The music is beautiful & the night time world that Travis is cruising around in is captured beautifully with it's glowing neon signs & colourful backgrounds very neo-noir with a touch of urban gothic Horror in a way.
Taxi Driver is a vigilante Thriller & a twisted dark crime drama.We all know the story so I'm gonna leave this review with this:
Taxi Driver is a true masterpiece & one of the greatest movies ever made.
I love this movie & it's one of the greatest films of the 70's & one of the greatest of all time.",10,0,3,11 May 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," AN EXCELLENT CONSPIRACY THRILLER & THE BEST & MOST GROWN-UP IN THE MCU,BRILLIANT
","Captain America: The winter soldier is an excellent Conspiracy Thriller that felt so familiar to me, like a 90's Thriller like Enemy of the State (1998) or Murder at 1600 (1996) or The Fugitive (1993) you get the idea, it felt old school & that made it more grounded.
This is a much better film than the first film & is one of the best sequels ever, especially in the super hero genre!!!This Captain America movie is the best I've seen in the MCU by far & that's because of it's real,grittier & more grounded approach, there's brutal fighting & terrorist shootouts, this is a conspiracy Thriller with a touch of fantasy with it being a super hero Marvel film but even with that it's still a much darker & more mature toned Marvel flick.
Steve Rogers/Captain America is easily the best character of the Avengers & is the most interesting & most human, here he goes on an emotional journey & questions the government & powers that control everything.
This is an exciting & intriguing Action Thriller that also rings true with it's corruption & conspiracy storyline.Steve Rogers is lost, he feels alone in an ever changing world & he's basically a relic of a time when being a Hero ment something & he knew what he was fighting for but now everything seems corrupted & feels wrong, what is a true man of honour supposed to do in a world like this?The loneliness is in Cap's eyes & it's an excellent very human performance from Chris Evans, who is perfect at coming accross dis-heartened & hurt at what he sees around him.
Can he trust S.H.I.E.L.D?
Is he fighting on the right side?
Captain America is lost & unsure & that's the heart of this excellent film.
Captain America is definitely my favourite character of all the Avengers & in this action packed Thriller he cements that status.The always excellent Samuel l Jackson plays Nick Fury more serious here too & has some fantastic edge of the seat scenes.
Black Widow is excellent in this movie & show's she's one of the smartest & toughest Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D again another excellent & kick a## performance from Scarlett Johansson.
Anthony Mackie is also fantastic as Falcon, he's a good man with a good heart & you can totally see why Cap trusts him.
Caps old war buddy & best friend Bucky is a terrifying & deadly Assassin, again another excellent character & performance, he comes accross so deadly & fast like a Terminator!!!
We also have the great tough guy Frank Grillo & even movie legend Robert Redford rounding out the fantastic cast.If like me you get bored of massive explosions & buildings getting blown up & want a more intriguing & more grounded Marvel film then Captain America:The winter soldier is definitely the one.A truly fantastic,exciting & fast paced action-packed Conspiracy Thriller.",9,2,5,11 August 2019
Justice League," GREAT ACTION PACKED FUN,LOVED IT & LOVED THE CHARACTERS, THIS IS DC's MASTERPIECE!!!
","From the AWESOME opening to the final battle i was hooked!!! It was great comic book blockbuster fun. Don't understand all the silly hate but i do get DC changed their tone & made this more fun with a little bit of humour & it worked absolutely fine in my opinion, The whole BRILLIANT cast really was PERFECT!!! Each excellent character had their time to shine & all had great chemistry together, Also the music score was Awesome. Steppenwolf was yes all c.g.i but looked & sounded excellent!!! The voice was great & perfectly fit the ancient character. All the action was great fun & the sewer scene with Batman's Awesome Nightcrawler vehicle was FANTASTIC!!! There's lots of great gems all through the movie, from great scenes to great character bits there's so many great parts, The Parademons look great, Lots more good things in this movie than bad things? So if you like it, just like it & forget all the hate!!! I totally enjoyed this as a big budget fun fantasy adventure & that's exactly what it was. 'The Flash' kinda stole the show as the funny younger hero & his own flash theme is beautiful. Totally Awesome fun & very underrated. Also BEN AFFLECK is still the absolute BEST batman & bruce Wayne we have EVER HAD!!!
'Aquaman' is excellent & 'Wonder women' is again fantastic & really holds the group together as the big heart of this rag tag team, the only character that didn't really get alot of depth was 'Cyborg' as i did hear he was supposed to be the main arc or heart of the movie but had lots of scenes cut so that impacted his character part.
'Superman' becomes the 'Real' superman in this movie, he become the comic book style icon.
The cast is excellent!!!Steppenwolf is one of the greatest movie villains I've seen in along time especially in big fantasy comic book films!!!!
'Justice league' is an easy10/10!!!
I've been really enjoying the DC universe movies & I've followed these more than the 'Marvel' films but i love both franchises.
DC films rated so far:
'Man of Steel' 9/10
'Batman vs Superman' 10/10
'Suicide squad' 9/10
'Wonder Woman' 9/10
'Justice league' 10/10
'Aquaman' 9/10
'Shazam' 8/10
'Harley Quinn & The Birds of Prey' 9/10Justice league is just a big budget action-packed,funny fantasy adventure!!! Would've loved it if this came out in the 90's & i saw it as a kid,
Justice league rivals Marvels Avengers & i love the Avengers films so much & Justice league is up there with those.It's Amazing seeing the Justice League on the big screen it was magical.",10,2,5,30 July 2018
28 Weeks Later," A FAST, FRANTIC, FEROCIOUS & FANTASTIC SEQUEL
","The first 28 Days Later is a modern Horror Classic & one of the scariest 'Infected' movie's ever made!!!
Yes these are the 'Infected' & Not Zombies, these are humans transformed by the Rage Virus & not brought back to life from dead as in Zombies.Now, This fantastic Sequel takes the 'Aliens' approach as it has lots more action & monsters for an Action-packed Horror sequel. Everything here is tightened up more & bigger in scale for fear & tension but i do still prefer the quietness, full of dread fear atmosphere from the first film, that really gets under the skin & makes you on feel on edge, but the tone & atmosphere is still strong & thick here but there's much more characters around this time so the scary isolated & lonely feel is not as strong here.People are starting to repopulate England, London & life is trying to get back to normal with the help of the U.S Army keeping watch & on guard. Everything feels realistic & the opinion sequence is absolutely terrifying & nearly equels the terror of the first film. We get an excellent & powerful performance from Robert Carlyle & his opening scene is energetic & heart-pounding with terror as Carlyle runs from lots of the Infected from his hideout farmhouse to the lake & IT'S pure Horror & gripping as hell!!!
A superb opening to set in stone that this sequel is gonna be just as Horrific as it's Classic first film.
The cast is excellent here with, like I've said Robert Carlyle, also Jeremy Renner, Rose Byrne, Idris Elba, Harold Perrineau, Imogen Poots & more. A solid cast of both American & British talent working together.
The usually great, Jeremy Renner stands out as expert Sniper-soldier Doyle, a 'Hicks' type of Good & strong take charge type of Soldier, a great heroic performance.
The Rage Virus obviously infects & spreads through the Country again & all hell breaks loose again & this time a group of survivors, including some kids & soldiers are on the run through London trying to survive from the Infected.
The infected are absolutely scary as hell again like the first flick & to me are probably the scariest Creatures to ever chase Humans in the Horror genre.
There's lots of super scary & intense moments scattered throughout the movie & everything is done in a gritty & raw look like the first but also in a Cinematic way & not like the low-budget look & feel of the Classic first film, which i personally liked better.28 Weeks Later is an excellent sequel & is just as much terrifying fun as the original but still not as great or as impactful as that Masterpiece.
I enjoyed & love both films in all their terrifying,gritty & gory glory!!!",9,0,0,24 March 2020

I love this film, the whole creepy atmosphere & dark cinematography by the legend Dean Cundy is superb & the awesome music by Carpenter is excellent & of course the AMAZING practical FX & the awesome casting.........except it's missing the perfect guy for this film the legendary Horror icon TOM ATKINS!!! it makes No sense as to why he's not cast? I mean he was good friends with John Carpenter at the time he had just starred in carpenters The Fog (1980) & Escape from New York (1981) & Tom said in an interview that he had discussed how much he loved the 50's original film & so did carpenter, so they talked about the movie & John must've known how excited Tom would have been to be apart of it & yet he cast every other guy but him? Makes No sense & Tom Atkins would have lifted the movie even more in quality, he would have been the best in it!!! Anyway that was a huge missed opportunity.
The cast is an ensemble cast of know the face actors & Carpenter regulars, i love the paranoid mood of the movie & the thick Atmosphere of dread that hangs over the film, this is one of Carpenters best films!!!
I used to watch this on video & absolutely loved everything about it & i still do!!! 'The Thing' yes it's a classic gory horror film & many class this as Carpenters masterpiece, my personal fave carpenter movie is 'THE FOG (1980)' but i can see why many love this great movie, it's in my top 5 of Carpenters films & in my all time favourite top 20 films list.
The always great 'Kurt Russell' gives a solid performance & has created another Classic character as he did in other John Carpenter films such as 'Escape from New York' & 'Big Trouble in little China' as we know Carpenter & kurt work perfectly together.
Kurt Russell is awesome,cool & iconic as 'Mcready' & the location is isolated & scary & like i said the fx are amazing so much better than the silly cheap looking c.g.i today!!!
The Thing is a Horror CLASSIC.
I love John Carpenter films & i consider him my favourite Director.
All in all this 1982 sci-fi Horror is a Classic of it's genre & is one of Carpenters best films!!!
Check out the equally excellent 'The Thing' 2011 prequel, it's just as great & surprisingly still very atmospheric & exciting.",10,1,2,15 August 2018
The Revenant," DICAPRIO IS OUTSTANDING, HARDY IS OUTSTANDING & THE FILM IS BRILLIANT
","Leo DiCaprio is excellent & Tom Hardy is excellent & both give outstanding performances in this gruelling survival drama.
The cinematography is gorgeous & the action is savage & bloody, the bear attack scene was the most realistic bear attack your ever likely to see in a movie ever!!!
Leo plays a scout tracker type of woodsman 'Hugh Glass' who witnessed his son murdered by the psychotic 'Fitzgerald' played by the always excellent Tom Hardy & here you will hate him, it's a mix of primal raw survival tale & a mission of vengeance through the unforgiving winter terrain of mountains & wild rivers & snow storms & Savage Indians as well as savage frontiersmen & hunters & wild bears as our survivor just keeps going with every breath getting closer.
It's an extremely wild ride & shows how brutal those times were for any race of people, I'm surprised anyone could survive during those dark times but they did.
'The Revenant' is a journey & adventure during those extreme western frontier times, so it's a period piece drama also but mainly IT'S a film of a man who has lost everything & has nothing to lose so with a heart full of rage he seeks revenge for his murdered son. A bleak story but an important one with a realism that's brutally captured on film.
A fantastic survival film",10,0,1,14 January 2020
Pitch Black," FANTASTIC SCI-FI HORROR, DESERVES TO BE NOTHING LESS THAN A TRUE CULT CLASSIC!!!
","I saw 'Pitch Black' when it first came out in 2000, i loved it back then & i still love it now!!!
It's a great mix of Horror & sci-fi with lots of suspense & a nice deserted eerie atmosphere.
Vin Diesel is Awesome & Cool as hell as tough Criminal 'Riddick' he's like a character from the universe of 'John Carpenter' a little bit of the iconic 'Snake Pliskin' is in there & the fact he's an Anti-Hero with a criminal past!!! Vin is great in this role & this was my first introduction to the cool voiced future Action star, we also have an excellent ensemble cast with Vin, we've got the always good 'Keith David' a star of John Carpenters 'The Thing' & 'They Live' & we have in the form of a tough chick 'Radha Mitchell' as the 2nd main lead & she's great but for me the 2nd best character & performance after 'Riddick' comes from the excellent Cole Hauser as 'Johns' the equally tough & troubled Bounty hunter transporting his prisoner 'Riddick' back to civilisation, it's a great intense & lively role for the underrated Hauser as he goes from cool,calm & in control to panicked & Angry often, he's a really interesting & conflicted character he's sly & corrupted by not totally evil, a great performance.The Creatures are Awesome looking, Night time sharp looking bat & shark type things, a really cool monster design & very creepy creatures that move very quickly & hunt in the dark.Pitch Black is an Awesome old school type of Sci-fi Horror film, it could've easily come out in the 80's as it's got that look & vibe to it, the lost desert planet they crash on looks like the wastelands of 'Mad Max' so it's got a real cinematic vision that feels like we know it!!!
There's plenty of excellent action scenes & plenty of cool monster attacks & some cool character bits especially the fight between 'Riddick' & 'Johns' a cool little scene.All in all 'Pitch Black' is a Gem of the sci-fi Horror genre, it fits in there with films like 'Aliens' 'Predator 1&2' & other Classic's of that genre.I've loved this since the vhs days & it's one of those films that if you haven't seen it in years, you watch it & can't believe how good it is!!!
Definitely nothing less than a true cult classic but deserves to be a Sci-fi Horror Classic like 'Aliens 1986'",10,3,4,30 October 2019
The Hills Have Eyes," A HORROR MASTERPIECE,ONE OF THE BEST HORROR'S EVER MADE & ONE OF THE BEST REMAKES EVER!!!
","The Hills Have Eyes 2006 remake is an instant CLASSIC!!!
The 70's wes craven original CLASSIC is obviously excellent but the remake makes everything abit better, scarier & a sense of more gritty realism, it's terrifying.
I'm not knocking the original 70's Classic as I'm a huge fan & think it's a Horror classic too, it's just the remake ups everything including the tense dread filled atmosphere & the savage mutant attacks, it's a blood soaked masterpiece of a remake & is genuinely terrifying, both films make for an excellent double bill.The atmosphere is so on the edge & full of dread, it's actually scary as hell without any silly comic moments, it's all kept tight,serious & tense.
The cast is superb, that goes for everyone in this movie!!!The desert setting is terrifying & lonely, the mutants are absolutely terrifying & extremely savage.
This is a brutal,raw survival Horror with intensely filmed action scenes & fight scenes that are horrifying.The whole mutant town scene is truly terrifying!!!
This is as raw & savage as these survival slashers can get along with the also outstanding Texas chainsaw massacre remake (2003) & the extremely underrated Horror Gem 'Borderland 2007'This is a bloody slaughter house of a movie with scary cannibal mutants slicing up anyone they can get & ordinary people rising to be heroic.A brilliant Horror masterpiece with intense performances & shocking gore.
Aaron Stanford gives the most powerful, intense & ferocious performance in the movie as 'Doug' a timid geek type of guy until his wife is murdered & his baby is taken, then he become a savage vigilante warrior who brutally fights back against the mutant hillbillies & it's fantastic to watch!!! It's one of the greatest performances in the Horror genre & his character 'Doug' is easily one of the greatest in the Horror genre!!!
Doug becomes as tough as Evil Dead's 'Ash' as he goes through hell to get his baby back & as heroic as 'Mad Max' by the end of the movie!!!
It's a standout stunningly raw performance.
Aaron Stanford is so great to watch fighting these monsters to save his baby, pure Horror & one of the greatest Horror movie hero performances of all time,
Just watch the tense as hell fight scene between him & Pluto, it's a terrifying & raw savage fight for your life sequence, one of the best fights in cinema history.
The Hills Have Eyes is truly a modern Horror MASTERPIECE.",10,4,5,4 August 2019
"I, Robot"," SINCE SEEING THIS IN THE CINEMA, IT'S BEEN MY FAVE WILL SMITH FILM.
","I, ROBOT is excellent, it's a detective Mystery Thriller in a futuristic world ruled by Robots & it's so much fun. Smith plays a troubled Chicago detective named 'Del Spooner' who doesn't trust Artificial intelligence at all & he has a good reason but i won't give anything away or go into the story as many already have but i will talk about the BRILLIANT world created in this absolute action packed masterpiece!!! Smith has never been better as this tough, couldn't care less what you think, troubled cop & he portrays it perfectly, what a good solid performance by Smith & what a cracking good exciting Thriller this is, it's a big budget blockbuster, that has depth & mystery & Amazing visuals, it's just a beautifully made film that rivals the likes of 'BLADERUNNER' it's that good & it's my favourite sci-fi film of the lot, & mainly due to Smith's incredible performance as 'Spooner'.
The movie is set in a futuristic Chicago
Where robots do most of the usual daily jobs, like garbage collection & bar keepers & walking peoples dogs & tons of other things & the city looks Amazing it has that slick & clean shiny silvery look to it, very artificial & that works well with this being a movie all about Artificial intelligence, the cars looks Awesome & all the production design looks fantastic & very interesting, everything looks stunning in this big pop Corn blockbuster!!!
I come back to this film over & over again it's that entertaining.
The FX are Amazing & cast is perfect all round but of course Smith is the one that really Shines & has created one of my favourite movie characters of all time!!! i so wish he would bring this character back in a sequel? So yeah just a BRILLIANT film with a BRILLIANT music score by 'Marco Beltrami' that adds such mystery & excitement to each frame it's that good infact it's probably my fave film score or atleast one of my faves of all time!!!
I,Robot has alot of amazing action packed scenes & big fx shots but this big budget summer blockbuster still has a heart at it's center & a dark look at our future of relying on gadgets, machines, robotics & Artificial intelligence.
I know this is a big 'action movie' starring the legendary huge star 'Will Smith' but there's still so much more under it's surface & alot of depth & emotion.
Will Smith is actually perfect for this movie & role as it's a big comfort seeing his warm & familiar face in a world that's so icey-cold metal looking & so Artificially created it's creepy, so Smith as Del Spooner grounds it all for us viewers & comforts us with his usual wise cracks approach to dangerous situations, i always felt that this film is where Will Smith really became a proper big Action star, by that i mean his role is the type that the Action King 'Schwarzenegger' would've played or 'Stallone' it's a great part as 'Spooner' is the heart & soul of this huge mega budget studio movie, the entire film is carried on Will Smith's shoulders & performance!!! Luckily Smith is perfectly cast & created his best movie character of all time in my opinion.
Smith is a big Action hero joy on screen & for me completely cemented him as one of Cinemas greatest stars.Detective Del Spooner is my favourite movie character of all time, i love how he's also a Nostalgic guy & his apartment is full of old school stuff, for an action Thriller 'Smith' has put alot into what could of been just a typical action hero role, this is why it's my favourite role/Character of the great Will Smith or next to his 'Agent J' but his Del Spooner lives in a paranoid state, he's full of fear of the robots that are apart of society now, Spooner has experienced tragic events that have left him emotionally & physically scarred, Smith has some fun with the role of 'Spooner' but also keeps that emotional state of fear upfront all the time & that makes 'Spooner' such an interesting character, he's a Detective but hates what he's Detecting!!! He has No trust in robotics or the people that make them & he does things his way without question, Spooner is a complex character that likes to work alone & seems comfortable as abit of a loner unless he really needs some help, there's definitely layers to Spooner that Will must of loved exploring like his anger & paranoid fear!!!i,Robot is a film that is made for repeated viewing & oh my have i watched this hundreds of times & i had the pleasure of seeing this in the cinema.
Will Smith is a childhood hero of mine, i grew up watching his Show 'The Fresh Prince of bel Air' I've always listened to his music & his first solo album 'Big Willie Style' is still my favourite album of all time, I've followed his career in music & movies & he's something of a positive role model for me.
If one guy has made a huge impact one me it's definitely Will Smith.
Will Smith means alot to me & his films, especially I,Robot, MIB 1&2 & Wild Wild West have gotten me through some very dark times.There's 3 main Will Smith movies that I've watched countless times over the years & that mean alot to me as I've watched these 'Comfort' films at different times in my life, through the good & the bad, these 2 special gems are of course 'I,ROBOT' & 'MIB' & it's
Sequel 'MIB 2' all three i hold near & dear to my heart & are in my all time top fave movies!!!",10,0,1,20 July 2018
Dunkirk," ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL,BRILLIANT & A MASTERPIECE
","I loved 'Dunkirk' & i nearly wasn't sure about giving this a try as i thought it would be another really over long boring epic but it wasn't at all, i mean it's Epic in nature as it's about the real battle at Dunkirk so it's all based on real events but it's running time was under 2hrs which is rare for a war based film & rare for a Christopher Nolan film.
I liked how the movie is framed by three stories going on at the time of Dunkirk, we get a Land, Sea & Air story that all gradually meet as one & it's all told so intensely & exciting as well as dramatic & often scary.
The look of this great film is beautiful & moody & the score is excellent & like a distant siren & eerie heartbeat that's always there as a symbol of danger is constantly there & no where feels safe thanks to the brilliant Hans Zimmer, also the movie moves at a good pace & feels like a survival Thriller set in war time.
The cast was great without having too many characters that often weighs everything down, no here we have a few main faces that we follow around in the interlinked stories but none are over dramatized, we got Tom Hardy as a Pilot always in the sky battling the enemy & pop singer Harry Styles is very good in his first ever movie role & debut role is of a surviving young soldier just simply trying to stay alive amongst the chaos & there's the only kind of main character in the movie another young scared soldier who we follow from the very beginning & who teams up with good young french soldier & Harry styles soldier & they become a trio of keep moving soldiers, that main kid is 'Tommy' played greatly by newcomer Fionn Whitehead & Harry's guy is called 'Alex' there's also a shivering shell shocked survivor played by Cillian Murphy so there's a good solid British cast.
Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director as we already know but i think his WW2 survival Drama 'Dunkirk' could be his best!!!
The atmosphere & mood is always kept very tense & almost creepy & danger always feels close by, at times almost as if 'John Carpenter' directed a War Film & that's a big compliment!!!All in all 'Dunkirk' is a superb war drama with an exciting survival Thriller tone & a great group of characters simply surviving a messy war & wanting to get home.
Also i get why we didn't HAVE big main characters to watch & that's because it's about the experience of the crazy war & just trying to keep moving & survive & it could be any man, any soldier story or any pilot story it's a view into the nightmare world of war as an average guy thrown into the thick of the action, it's a film made for the average soldier who can become a hero just by staying alive long enough to get home. EXCELLENT!!!!
Proud to be BRILLIANT.",10,1,3,9 January 2020
Aliens," A BRILLIANT SCI-FI HORROR MASTERPIECE.
","WOW Aliens is BRILLIANT & I've been a massive fan since i was young & watched it on video & became obsessed with this absolute CLASSIC piece of sci-fi action Horror.The characters have become iconic such as Ripley,Hicks & Hudson among others & i always loved Hicks best infact he's always been my favourite character in the whole franchise!!!The atmosphere & tone is creepy & unsettling & full of excitement & danger & with fantastic music & outstanding creature fx by legendary Stan Winston Aliens is a full on mind blowing action packed experience & is a true CLASSIC not a cult classic a full on one of the best films ever made!!!Aliens is still the absolute best film in the franchise & yes is way better than the classic original!!!
Everything about this movie has become Classic & iconic & is a massive piece of Nostalgia for me along with Predator & Predator 2 & Alien Resurrection (2nd best in the Alien franchise) among others but Aliens stands out as a masterpiece of sci-fi like Blade runner & Escape from New York.James Cameron directed the hell out of Aliens & crafted & created an atmospheric,exciting & explosive Horror set in space & those marine characters are legendary!!!",10,1,6,9 February 2019
Captain America: Civil War," BRILLIANT!!! A TOUGH LOOK AT HERO CONFLICT.
","WOW!!! Civil War is absolutely Brilliant, the darker more serious tone of the excellent Winter Soldier has carried over to this fantastic film.The action scenes & fight scenes are absolutely fantastic in Civil War, especially the frantic & exciting gritty opening action packed scene with Cross Bones & his terrorist team, it's outstanding.A big cast of great actors & characters mixed into a political nightmare that's handled perfectly with a gritty & dark tone & dangerous Atmosphere.
Steve Rogers is again fantastic as the troubled Captain America who is torn between what's right & wrong & friends & enemies & loyalties are broken, Civil War is a mature super hero movie.
Just like the equally excellent Winter Soldier, this Civil War is handled with a sense of real grit & harsher so these characters feel like they exist in the real complicated world.Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther is a fantastic actor & brings heart & soul to his character, Panther steals the show alot when he's on screen.
There's so many Awesome characters here such as Spiderman, Ant-Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow & more great stars of the Marvel universe but it's the interesting & intense relationship between Steve Rogers & Tony Stark that is at the heart of this serious sci-fi Thriller.
Captain America vs Iron man.
The winter soldier himself Bucky is has a bigger & more tragic story here, he has been mind controlled for years & now has to deal with the torment of his past actions & the complete loneliness he feels as an outsider who is good at heart & best friends with childhood pal Steve Rogers but has been a deadly Assassin for so long he mind is a mess, IT'S a really well told little story arc for the character & he becomes one of the best characters in the movie.Chris Evans is absolutely excellent in his iconic role as Steve Rogers/Cap & he's my reason for getting into these films of the Marvel universe, Captain is such a great Troubled character to follow on his adventures as he's a loner really, a lost man from a completely different world & he's always trying to find his porpoise & his meaning in this new messed up terrorist & corruption filled world.Although this is a big budget Superhero film it's all handled like a deep serious Thriller just like The winter soldier & that's because of the excellent directors the Russo bros they know how to work a fantasy story & mixed it into a real grittier environment.Captain America:Civil War is One of the greatest Marvel movies of all tine",10,0,1,18 August 2019
Die Hard 2," THE BEST DIE HARD FILM & A GREAT XMAS FILM
","I've always loved & preferred the Excellent sequel 'Die Hard 2' over the original 'Classic' as i think it's a much better film, it's got a beautiful Christmas atmosphere complete with snow storms outside of the big airport at xmas time, the mood is festive & feelgood & a great set-up for a Terrorist filled Action Thriller plot.Yes i grew up watching & loving the 'Die Hard Trilogy' & I've always loved that excellent underrated Sequel over the lot!!!
I love the main villain much more than 'Hans Gruber' in Die Hard, here we have the Brilliant William Sadler as a cold blooded killer named 'Col. Stuart' & his performance is great as he plays it serious & sinister plus I've always been a big William Sadler fan & love his intense performances in films such as the urban survival Thriller 'Trespass' from 1992 & the Tales from the Crypt Horror movie 'Demon Knight' from 1995 & the crazy fantasy comedy sequel 'Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey' from 1991, Sadler is a great underrated actor.The Airport setting is exciting & atmospheric, the dead of winter plays a big special part with it's festive Christmas theme, the tone is fun & brutal action, this is a thrilling movie even more so than the Classic first film!!!
I also prefer the cool wisecracking tough 'John Mclane' here played obviously by Bruce Willis, i like the Action set pieces best here & the edgd of the seat thriller elements like the planes running out of fuel idea & the double crossing of good guy soldiers are actually plotting terrorists, there's a great story here & more excitement this time around.This is similar to other sequels that i genuinely like just as much if not more than the first films such as 'Robocop 2' & 'Ghostbusters 2' & 'Predator 2' & 'Gremlins 2' & 'Lethal weapon 2' & 'Aliens' & 'Mad Max 2' & a few other's.",10,4,5,30 November 2019
Resident Evil," ONE OF THE BEST ZOMBIE FILMS EVER MADE & ONE OF MY BEST FILMS!!!
","This first film in the Resident Evil franchise came out in 2002 & i couldn't wait to see it at the cinema & i did & it was EXCELLENT!!! i loved this John Carpenter inspired survival Horror, infact if John Carpenter made a zombie film this would be it & that's a huge compliment.I saw this at the cinema & it was a fun time watching this survival Horror film & probably the most fun I've had watching a film at the cinema!!!
It felt like this movie was made for me as at the time i was obsessed with Zombie films & i couldn't wait to see this & it didn't disappoint at all, infact it was even more enjoyable & entertaining & exciting that i could've imagined!!!
Every time i revisit this film I'm reminded just how damn good it REALLY is & if I'm the only one who likes it this much i don't care as it's definitely a personal favourite of mine & one of my all time favourite films.
I have big love & big Nostalgia for this Action zombie film as it was the first ever 'Zombie' film i saw at the cinema & that's a big deal to me as i grew up obsessed with Zombie films such as George Romero's Dead Trilogy & the Evil Dead Trilogy, i honestly loved 'Resident Evil' it's a nice budget take on those old school zombie films with a nice dose of 'John Carpenter' mixed in so how could i not love this?
The production design is excellent within the Hive & the first zombie encounter is done so well with suspense,Horror & action as we have our mixed group of Commandos & survivors having to work together to get out alive, i love that ensemble lgroup dynamic of different characters teamed up, great fun.
A couple of good standout characters other than the main stars, were British actor Colin Salmon who plays the leader of the group of Commandos & his big tall frame & deep commanding voice adds alot to the very creepy beginning scenes, his character is not around long but he makes such an intense presence on screen that i would've loved him to have been a main lead!!! Also the computer expert/soldier 'Kaplan' is good played by another British actor Martin Crewes, a good solid cast with everyone involved actually.
Some of the imagery is the best I've ever seen in a zombie film & the design & look is incredible like the underground Access tunnels scene with the dripping water & grimy walls & old pipes that are heroes have to crawl accross that's an incredibly exciting & intense sequence as is the iconic laser hallway scene & the test subjects tanks scene when we first meet a zombie & the atmosphere is so raw & full of dread with it's dark smoky look & then hearing a metal being dragged accross the floor noise it's a zombie dragging an axe, just some of the greatest suspenseful moments in a zombie film I've ever seen, this movie doesn't get the recognition it so deserves & yes the other films in the franchise are not very good & don't come no where near the level of brilliance & quality here so this one 2002 movie that started it all should be considered a 'Cult Classic' & it's definitely the best movie made by Paul Anderson.
'RESIDENT EVIL' is ridiculously underrated & yet it's more exciting than most huge budget films at the cinema now!!! To me it's a zombie masterpiece that could easily fit into the universe of the legendary 'John Carpenter' it's got a primal raw survival tone & cold high-tech & artificial intelligence feel to it when our team enter the scary 'Hive' underground lab base, i feel that contract of old & new here like i did with 'Escape from New York' & the violent bloody rawness of old school zombie flicks like 'Dawn of the Dead' for example, there's alot of quality in this film to ignore & i love it.The music score at the beginning sets the tone, it's a creepy digital score that sounds like a 'Carpenter' inspired 80s synth score, it's really well done & one of my favourite music scores ever as it's so creepy.
The cast was great especially Milla Jovovich & Michelle Rodriquez both are great actors & are both fantastic tough ladies of Action in this film, obviously 'Alice' (Jovovich) is the heart of the movie & is on a mission to uncover the truth about herself & what's happening & 'Rain' (Rodriguez) is a no nonsense tough as hell soldier & she will stop at nothing to get her job done. Great performances.
the rest of the team are all good in their roles basically Marine types & the zombies look great with excellent FX especially the big Licker monster!!!
The underground lab where the zombie outbreak starts is a really creepy setting for a zombie movie & the whole idea of a group of marines having to sneak in & shut it down is very exciting with a great sense of dread atmosphere, one of the best scenes in the movie is the terrifying laser corridor sequence, it's a scary scene & we lose most of the soldiers in that Corridor before we even get to the zombies!!!
Resident Evil is definitely one of my personal favourite Zombie films of all time, i put this in my top 5 along with 'Dawn of the Dead 1978' 'Day of the Dead 1985' '28 Days Later' & 'Night of the Living Dead 1990' all Excellent Zombie films!!!
There's a great mix of cold Technical cybernetic futuristic surroundings, with the underground Hive base, & old fashioned bloody flesh-Eating zombie carnage, it's this mix of Sci-fi & Horror that makes Resident Evil very exciting,edgy & Awesome.
There's an icey-cold scary atmosphere within 'The Hive' as the corridors are empty & silent & at any moment our survivors could turn a corner into wondering zombies, it's enclosed & claustrophobic trapped setting reminded me definitely of the legendary 'Carpenter' in it's look,mood & style.
I love this movie & it's mix of exciting action scenes & moody creepy Horror & dark futuristic sci-fi setting, a stunning mix done perfectly.a BRILLIANT & scary ending but it's a shame the sequel is Terrible to follow on from this great ending!!!
A great sci-fi action Horror Thriller & EASILY the best of the whole franchise & really the only great movie of the LOT!!!
Yeah good suspense & very exciting Action make RESIDENT EVIL a great film & one of the best Zombie flicks out there!!! Definitely an underrated CLASSIC in my opinion & one hell of a fun ride & a great popcorn flick too!!!
The most fun zombie flick ever.",10,4,6,3 August 2018
Avengers: Endgame," AN ABSOLUTE SUPERHERO MASTERPIECE!!! EMOTIONAL & OUTSTANDING.
","WOW!!!
End Game, that film blew me away,
It's truly a MASTERPIECE of cinema & not just of the comic book world, i was amazed at how beautiful & devastating this movie was & how deeply it affected me!!!
Everything came together perfectly to create something really special & powerful, that much talent & characters all come together in a beautifully touching way it really is a technical masterpiece of filmmaking!!!I'm massively into the 'Avengers' movies but not so much all the characters own films as there's so many, but the ones i have seen have all been excellent, Captain America & Hawkeye are my favourite characters of the Avengers team & I've loved all the Avengers films right upto 'End Game' & then just WOW!!!This is a very dark & apocalyptic fantasy Thriller, all the stakes are higher & the atmosphere is of sadness & loneliness, Clint aka Hawkeye really feels like the heart of this particular Avengers film as we see him as the ordinary & loving Family man who loses his family & becomes a dangerous vigilante, Hawkeye uses his skills to hunt & kill criminals & you feel his sadness,his anger & his despair & Jeremy Renner gives the best performance so far as the troubled Hawkeye, it's a dark path for a complex character & that's just the start of End Game.
Captain America is the main big beating heart behind all this darkness & Chris Evans gives his most powerful performance so far as cap, Black Widow has some extremely dark & emotional moments & Tony Stark shows why he's such an important Avenger as well as the smartest!!! Heroes rise & Heroes fall.All the characters are fantastic here in End Game, each character is given more depth,drama & emotion so you really care for this team.
The apocalyptic world is very eerie with half the people missing, it's creepy & lonely looking, the atmosphere is dark & gloomy & our heroes need to change this world.
End Game still has hilarious moments scattered throughout it's huge running time as it does with the amount of emotional drama & action packed scenes, there's never a dull or boring moment i thought as i totally got into this dark new world created by the evil 'Thanos'
The Action is breathtakingly Awesome & the c.g.i fx are Outstanding to the highest quality with it's massive budget put to full use, this is an epic film in every way!!!
The visual look is stunning!!!
By the End i was an emotional wreck as the characters touched my heart & the action put on screen blew me away, this is the best Avengers movie it's also the ultimate Comic book movie & an instant CLASSIC.Just watch it & laugh & cry at a MASTERPIECE of cinema.
When it ended i felt a big sense of loss,sadness & Happiness & that's how this masterpiece grabs you by the heart!!!
Excellent but my personal favourite Avengers film is still 'Age Of Ultron'",10,2,5,8 September 2019
Independence Day," A BRILLIANT SPECTACULAR 90S SCI-FI CLASSIC BACK WHEN FILMS WERE FUN AT THE CINEMA!!!
","Independence day is one of those absolutely incredible movies that is totally a 90s CLASSIC!!! A big budget blockbuster that is Action packed with heart,drama & comedy. I grew up watching & loving this film & always loved WILL SMITH as captain Steven Hiller the mouthy Action Hero, One of Smith's best roles & one of his best movies!!! WILL SMITH owned the 90s & was & is still always a hero of mine. BILL PULLMAN was also great as the president & JEFF GOLDBLUM was funny & great as was the whole cast & the Alien FX are still Amazing even today!!! A real treat of a movie. INDEPENDENCE DAY is a 10/10 spectacular blockbuster movie & makes me Nostalgic just thinking about it!!!
This film along with lots really that impacted me growing up in the Awesome 90s was about big spectacular fun on the big screen, 'ID4' was a perfect summer blockbuster movie, people had Fun watching it like they did with others excellent 90's Summer flicks 'Men in Black' & 'The Mummy' & 'Lost in Space' & 'Star Gate' you get the point, not everything like today's social media obsessed world was picked apart & over analysed, films could just be big fun pieces of entertainment & nice escapism!!!
I love these types of films & hold them very close to my movie loving heart.
Times have really changed & for the worse, especially with movies & how they are hated on & totally despised before even being released? Now the hate starts from a simple teaser trailer & it's completely ridiculous!!! No one just enjoys what movies are about anymore.
Anyway Will Smith is my all time favourite actor & childhood hero, Smith in movie's means alot me & i defend most of them, especially these days where everyone hates on 90's movie's & only likes 'Stranger Things' the world is mental!!!Anyway love 'Independence Day' & it's one of the greatest summer blockbuster movie's of all time!!!",10,1,2,31 July 2018
Toy Story 4," BEAUTIFUL, SAD, EMOTIONAL & MAGICAL!!! A LOVELY FILM & ANOTHER MASTERPIECE!!! VERY SPECIAL.
","WOW how far Toy Story has come!!!
I've grown up with these film's the same as Andy grew up with his Toys about the same time & age, so this franchise & it's wonderful characters mean so much to me, as i really did grow up with them, 'Toy Story' was such a big part of my childhood that it's had a huge impact on me & as an adult (A 35yr old man) i feel attached to that little gang a good-hearted Toys!!!
I'm very emotionally invested in this beautiful franchise of fantasy & magic.
It's a lovely Nostalgic comfort hearing the great voice of movie legend 'Tom Hanks' back as Woody, i love Hanks & i know he's more loved now for his brilliant serious performances but to me it was his funny & goofy roles that have always stayed with me from such CLASSIC 80's films as 'Dragnet 1987' & 'The 'Burbs 1989' both huge films to me growing up in the 90's as i constantly watched these two on video over & over again, then came the first Toy Story in 1995 & blew me away & those three 'Hanks' movies are so special to me & each has a special spot in my heart as well as on my all time favourite movies list.Toy Story '95 was way,way ahead of it's time & blew me away with it's ground-breaking animation & Amazing characters.
Woody was always my favourite & I've watched him grow as a thinking, good hearted character through the films.
All 4 movie's are instant CLASSIC's & that's special for a franchise!!!
Toy Story 3 was BEAUTIFUL, i was an emotional wreck by the end of that & it ended perfectly.But here we are back again for Toy Story 4 & it's ok because the film is absolutely Brilliant & is the most visually stunning of the whole franchise!!!
It's lovely to see our old friends again, the Gang are back & a few new characters are introduced.
The animation has advanced to perfection.
This story is about woody really & how he feels lost & not needed anymore, it's handled beautifully & touching, Toy Story 4 is the most grown-up & most serious of the series & often creepy & a mood of sadness hangs over the movie.
Toy Story 4 brings back Bo peep & tells her story as well as tell woody's dilemma & introduces a new character for the gang called 'Forky'
There's a sweet love story in here too, Woody & Bo Peep & it's beautiful, i was an emotional wreck at the end as it's really saying goodbye to this wonderful franchise we all grew up loving, a masterpiece movie & my favourite of the franchise.
I do really appreciate the darker & creepier tone to this sequel, at times with the creepy ventriloquist dummies in the old antiques store, it's like stepping into 'Goosebumps' territory with 'Slappy' it's got an old school Nostalgic Horror quality & i loved it.There's a few little stories entwined together but mainly this is Woody's story & his movie.
There's some fun stuff here, mostly with Woody trying to look after forky like a father & his kid.
The basic story is the gang of Toys go on a road trip with Bonnie & her parents & end up meeting some strange characters at a fun fare & old antique shop.
There's a sense of something big is gonna happen in it's atmosphere whenever woody is on screen, There's a change coming & you can feel it.I felt Toy Story 4 was also the darkest of the franchise, it dealt with real emotion coming from Woody.
Woody feels so lost & lonely, he doesn't feel wanted anymore & doesn't have a purpose anymore!!!
He doesn't get played with & is feeling the loss.
What do Toys do when they don't have an owner anymore?
What do they do if they never get played with?
There's some emotional questions for the toys.
Woody also acts like a father figure to Forky which is funny & touching at the same time!!!
This sweet heart-felt movie has so much beautiful little moments & scenes, it's a special film in an outstanding franchise & i would say part 4 is the best & is on a different level in some respects.Toy Story 4 is another beautiful film in the outstanding franchise, it's beautiful to look at & full of emotion.
If you grew up watching & loving these films then part 4 will hit you hard at the end!!!
Now this great film part 4 didn't need to be made, as part 3 ended beautifully but I'm so glad this got made because it really does carry on the story to another logical conclusion & still with an impactful ending that is both very sad & at the same time very sweet, it will bring tears to the eyes.The new characters are fun with the likes of 'Bunny' 'Ducky' & 'Forky' & some other's but those 3 stand out the most & have the most to do.
'Gabby Gabby' the old doll is a sort of villain type with a sad story & there's some creepy ventriloquist dummies that are her henchmen.
The big old Antique shop setting is stunning in it's look & detail, There's such an exciting old style atmosphere whenever the Toys are there.Like part 3, this film has a big heart & emotional scenes that made me cry like a baby!!!
I think this is my favourite of the franchise? Or maybe that's because it's so fresh & new? But it is excellent even though the original Toy gang all take a back seat for this film, even Buzz is basically a minor character here but it's ok because this film gives us so much else to focus on.Toy Story 4 is an instant CLASSIC.
I absolutely loved watching this with my wife & kids who all loved it.
A lovely & bittersweet ending to an incredible franchise that is loved so much, especially by me.
I've loved all these films & it's one beautiful epic fantasy franchise.",10,2,5,10 July 2019
Non-Stop," A GREAT ENTERTAINING MYSTERY THRILLER
","Liam Neeson is an action legend in his own right & has made some of the most entertaining Action Thriller's of the about the last ten years, we've had Neeson vs wolves in the snowy wilderness survival Thriller The Grey & we've had his iconic kidnap & revenge Taken Trilogy & his memory loss Mystery with Unknown & his troubled grizzled Detective Crime Thriller, A Walk Among The Tombstones & his Survive the night chase Thriller, Run All Night, all excellent Neeson flicks. So it's definitely safe to say that Neeson is an action Hero legend just a later in life ageing action hero but already he's one of the greats in my opinion & i just totally enjoy his films as he takes out plenty of villains & saves the day, he makes high class slick, big budget action Thriller's that are a perfect night time watch as a 'Popcorn' flick.Non-stop is a smart & stylish suspenseful Murder Mystery Thriller with some good action scenes but it's mainly in the Thriller genre just like Neesons other Mystery Thriller flick 'Unknown' with the same Director (Jaume Collet-Serra) who obviously has a great working relationship with the ageing action star as they've made so far four films together with Unknown, Non-stop, Run All Night & The Commuter.
Here Neeson plays another troubled & rugged type of character with a very sad backstory as an Air Marshall named Bill Mark who gets thrown right into a deadly mystery aboard his flight with a terrorist messaging him about a passenger with die every twenty minutes if his demands are not met. Neeson does give such a good paranoid & frustrated performance & has created one of his best characters in my opinion.The suspense is high & very claustrophobic as our hero is stuck on the plane wondering up & down the aisles & looking at the passenger's wondering who it is.
I liked the quiet & lonely night time atmosphere. This is a smart Mystery & an exciting one too & it has a nice night time feel to it & a slick look & a great supporting cast with an excellent Julianne Moore in a good solid role here with some nice character depth & back story as Jen, a passenger who helps our hero & we have an off duty New York Cop named Austin played by Corey Stoll & he's a good character here too & there's also solid performances from Scoot McNairy, Nate Parker, Michelle Dokery & Lupita Nyong'O.
Non-stop is a fun popcorn Thriller that keeps you guessing & wondering who is doing this & why? How many terrorists? It's a clever story & also frustrating as Neeson's Character is constantly being look at as the terrorist himself as things keep happening & pointing directly at him by the clever terrorist.
Just an enjoyable Neeson thriller & he's so good at them.",9,0,0,20 April 2020
The Transporter," AN ACTION CULT CLASSIC!!! PURE B-MOVIE FUN
","Jason Statham has become a British van damme & he is very cool & has become an awesome action star in his own right!!! 
Statham was Excellent as one of the expendables in the great action packed trilogy & was fantastic in The Mechanic & Home front films he also was very cool in Death Race & Ghosts of mars but i honestly liked him best in this first Transporter film!!! 
Here we see & witness Statham become the brutal action hero we all know now!!! But this felt like his Die Hard or his Taken & so on as this action packed Thriller was his big action break & his trademark role & has become an action cult classic.
Statham here is a nice mix of bruce Willis (his bald head & stubbled face) & Van damme (his ripped body & fighting moves) & he really is cool to watch especially the 'oil fight' that's a great fight scene & yes this has the usual corny & cheesy bits but that's what makes this movie a throwback to those old school action films, this is a very slick looking film with tons of Action & stunts but still on the lower budget side & that's very cool!!! 
Frank Martin is a cool character but only the first film is good the others are TERRIBLE & try to be like a fast & furious film & i HATE that franchise!!! But yeah wanna see Statham do action old school style & be very cool then see this first entry.
A little cult classic action movie that's a lot of fun probably still Statham's best solo movie? or at least i enjoyed this one the most so far",8,0,0,22 August 2018
28 Days Later...," A BRILLIANT TERRIFYING BRITISH HORROR!!! AN INSTANT CLASSIC
","28 days later (2002) is an instant CLASSIC in my opinion, it was a huge hit back when it first hit the cinema in 2002 & i saw it on the big screen & it was so exciting & scary as hell!!!
British films in general are not usually that good at all especially Horror movies so when 28 came out i was blown away by this terrifying infection film.This is the greatest 'Infection' or 'Infected' film ever made or side by side with Eli Roth's CABIN FEVER, & the greatest Zombie movie ever made is the George Romero 1985 Masterpiece 'Day of the Dead'
My other favourite 'Infected' movie is Eli Roth's 2002 Cabin Fever & then there's the excellent, Will Smith infection Thriller 'I Am Legend' all great films in the Infection Sub-genre.The look of the film is amazing, it's very real & very gritty & has a very unsettling atmosphere. The infected people are ridiculously scary lol the make up fx look stunning & no use of c.g.i so it's amazing to look at the infected running through the abandoned London streets!!!
There's so much good stuff in this film that makes this a classic Horror movie.
28 days later also has that very old school feel to it, that dark & moody gritty low budget approach like those old 70's Horror Thriller films such as SHIVERS (1975) & RABID (1977) two excellent Infected David Cronenberg films & 28 has that feel intentional or not?
The cast are excellent & give great performances especially, Cillian Murphy who gives the standout performance here & who became a big Movie star after this in America. Also we an excellent Naomie Harris as the tough & brutal warrior survivor, Salena, also a strong solid performance from the great Brendan Gleeson (Lake Placid) as a good man & father trying to keep his daughter safe & another great performance comes from Christopher Eccleston as a sinister Army captain with scary motives, a superb all British cast of top talent here!!!The empty London here looks so scary & menacing, also the music is excellent some times very sad & scary that it captures the loneliness & other times very almost 80's style but always excellent!!!
So yes a very surprisingly excellent British infection film by a director that i would Never usually be interested in or watch his films at all!!! I Hated the DEPRESSING & GRIM overrated 'Trainspotting' & i didn't like 'The Beach'
But his, 28 days later is a great film & is extremely powerful & suspenseful & is actually an important film in the genre.
Raw, real & scary as hell, also scarily more relevant each year!!!",10,0,3,15 August 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," ANOTHER SPECTACULAR MARVEL CLASSIC
","Infinity War is another spectacular piece of filmmaking & another amazing Avengers movie with all the star studded cast of characters we love.
End Game was an easy 10/10 instant epic Classic & so is Infinity war, the special effects are fantastic as always & the action is incredible & the great characters all get some real time to shine with that hilarious banter & humour that the Avengers are known for but also the stakes are much higher here & the danger is even more deadlier for our heroes.The evil Thanos is collecting up his Infinity stones & will destroy anyone in his path with his deadly army & he's here on earth causing mega destruction & all our heroes come together & join forces in an epic battle of good vs evil to save our world.I loved this movie so much & it's a huge big budget blockbuster movie, a beautiful fantasy adventure that is ridiculously entertaining & fun. I love big popcorn movies & comic book movies & I've loved nearly all the MCU flicks that I've seen & Infinity War is probably my favourite of the Avengers films & one of the best Marvel has made.
The cinematography is gorgeous & the music theatrical & exciting & i loved having the Guardians of the galaxy back here & of course the hilarious Thor steals the show alot with his hilarious attitude & kick-ass fighting, i love that dude but all the characters do get a great scene or more to do their stuff.A fantastic special effects extravaganza & an instant fantasy action Classic!!!",10,0,2,21 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A TOUCHING LOVE LETTER TO HOLLYWOOD & THE LOVE OF MOVIES.
","After this outstanding movie i believe Quentin Tarantino is probably the greatest director of all time? Maybe? But he's definitely one of the best ever, my favourite is 'John Carpenter' followed by 'Ivan Reitman'.
CINEMA & movies are a better place for having Tarantino & i thank him for making movies the way he does.Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of the greatest performances in cinema history!!! He's truly phenomenal as 'RICK DALTON'
TARANTINO at his epic greatest here.
I love the guy for what he does & how much he loves movies & the history of cinema, his love letter here is a beautiful & touching fairy tale about Hollywood & one of the famous Horrific tragedies that happened but in Tarantino's universe he cleverly rewrites History & makes the world a little bit better.
'Once upon a time in Hollywood' is a beautifully filmed & crafted story of two buddies surviving the ups & downs of making movies in Hollywood & it's that buddy friendship that's at the heart of this wonderful movie, Leonardo DiCaprio is probably the greatest actor of all time & his performance here as insecure,troubled & struggling actor 'Rick Dalton' is one of his best of his incredible Career, also Brad Pitt is good as his reliable best bud & stunt double 'Cliff Booth' & I'm not a Pitt fan at all but here he's good fun & Tarantino seems to get the best out of him in terms of performances!!!
I loved the extremely detailed old fashioned 60's production design & gorgeous look of the movie, everything is perfect & that's Because Tarantino knows his stuff & is a perfectionist, i loved the humour & the tons of famous actor cameos especially Kurt Russell, also the music was great & the Spahn Ranch scene was intense & exciting, this brought a tear to my eye for the whole love of movies that comes accross on screen, this is a movie for movie lovers & shows how important movies are to those that love them so much as i do.
A wonderful delight & powerful piece of cinema that's totally entertaining all the way to the bloody massacre & the really beautiful ending of what if...Really a special period piece with a fantastical Tarantino twist.",9,1,8,16 January 2020
Django Unchained," TARANTINO'S WILD WILD WEST
","Another great Tarantino film & another big hit, here Tarantino takes us back to the old south just before the Civil war & drops us off in the horrible racist Slavery times & takes us on a violent & bloody quest of vengeance!!!
Tarantino DEFINITELY watched Will Smith's WILD WILD WEST whilst preparing this move!!!!
Tarantino is an outstanding film maker as we know & here he delivers all the quality & great dialogue we've come to expect & his casting is again Amazing with an excellent Jamie Foxx as the 'Django' the freed slave in search of his beautiful wife played by Kerry Washington, & 'Django' is helped by a German bounty hunter named King Schultz, an outstanding performance by Christoph Waltz, the two become partners as bounty hunters & Django becomes an incredible marksman who can really handle his guns. The two Bounty hunters go from town to town & plantation to plantation in search of Criminals & Django's wife, this leads them to the evil plantation owner Calvin Candie, an excellent performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as such a nasty & evil villain of this piece. There's also Tarantino regular Samuel L Jackson as an evil black butler type who is just as racist as the Southern whites!!! There's lots of other great actors in small roles & there's lots of very funny moments & black humour throughout but there's also still the dark & raw look into the evil times of slavery & it gets extremely violent & bloody. I loved this mix of fact & fiction turned into a revenge fantasy just like Tarantino did with his 'Inglourious Basterds' & his 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' that's why he's such a great story teller & film maker. I did notice alot of similarities to the excellent but underrated Will Smith western 'Wild Wild West' from 1999, now i know the part of 'Django' was written with Will Smith in mind but he turned it down, so there's lots of bits & bobs & scenes & it's look that Tarantino obviously borrowed from Smith's Wild Wild West!!!
Smith would've been excellent as Django as he's a great actor but hey we got the excellent Jamie Foxx & he nailed the part as extremely tough & raw freed slave.
When the killing gets going it's so exciting & gripping as these evil Slave traders so deserve to die brutally & Django delivers, my favourite line in the movie is 'I like the way you Die boy' from Django before he blasts an evil redneck in the chest, it's beautiful.
The movie looks fantastic & never was it boring because it's so interesting watching these richly detailed characters & this dark & dangerous world they are in & i loved the idea of these two Bounty hunters on a quest of vengeance!!! Another great Tarantino movie & another instant Classic.",9,2,3,27 January 2020
Get Out," OUTSTANDING HORRIFIC THRILLER.
","Get out is a knockout of the Horror/ thriller genre & a future CLASSIC!!!!The performance from Daniel kayluuya as Chris was outstanding just BRILLIANT this guy can act & will be a huge star in the future I'm sure!!!The story is full of creepy eerie suspense & an atmosphere that's dread filled & a very old school 70's sounding music score all add to this edge of the seat dark Thriller.
Won't go into the story & no need to spoil anything just watch this dark & often funny Shocker!!!",9,1,6,27 February 2019
Aladdin," ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!! BEAUTIFUL & MAGICAL. WILL SMITH IS STILL THE BEST MOVIE STAR EVER.
","WOW!!! Aladdin is a beautiful movie full of magic & meaning!!!
I was totally mesmerized but what i saw on screen,it was magical & the entire cast was superb especially my childhood hero Will Smith,he was fantastic & even better than the great Robin Williams R.I.P un my opinion!!!I've always loved Will Smith as an actor & Rapper & an icon & a man & here his performance was one of his best!!! Definitely in his top 5 greatest performances of his fantastic career!!!
Smith sprinkled Fresh Prince over his magical fun loving,feelgood genie & he was a pleasure to watch.
There's nothing like Smith completely enjoying himself on screen, his charm was there & his big smile, Will Smith is still the best movie star ever in my opinion.
After growing up watching & loving the Cool guy, it's so nice to see him still on the big screen & his fame star still hasn't faded.
Yep, Big Will is my all time favourite actor & he means alot to me as his movie's have gotten me through some tough times in my life.Aladdin was also fantastic,beautifully played by Mena Massoud, this guy is excellent & will be a huge star!!!
Princess Jasmine is absolutely beautiful with a strong woman presence & a stunningly beautiful voice too, she is perfectly played by the excellent Naomi Scott.The performances of everyone is spot on & perfect as is all the songs & music!!! It's a beautifully filmed masterpiece full of stunning scenery & lovely characters with morals & inner strength,there's lots of messages in this CLASSIC.
Full of fun,Adventure & HEART.I laughed,i smiled & i cried
Aladdin is a true instant CLASSIC & a masterpiece of Director Guy Ritchie.
Loved every minute & so did my little daughter who took me to see it on father's day. Just pure MAGIC",10,3,7,17 June 2019
Ghost Rider," AN AWESOME COMIC-BOOK FANTASY, AN UNDERRATED GEM
","I admit that when i first saw Ghost Rider on t.v i didn't really like it, i thought it was too cheesy but i recently gave it another try because i love most of the Marvel studios films.
Yes i was a fan of the early 2000's Marvel films, well before the Connected Universe stuff, I'm a big fan of the Excellent 2003 The Punisher, starring Thomas Jane, it's an underrated CLASSIC in my opinion!!! Also the fantastic Ang Lee directed Superhero Drama 'Hulk' from 2003, starring Eric Bana & then there's the extremely underrated 'Daredevil' from 2003, starring Ben Affleck, also the Excellent Sam Raimi directed Spiderman Trilogy, Marvel was already making excellent but very underrated movies way back then.
Now, Ghost Rider fits into the very underrated Marvel movies. I recently brought it on dvd & watched it & was totally surprised by how much i enjoyed it, a fantasy western Horror Thriller.
I've always liked Nicolas Cage & here he's perfectly cast as the cocky & crazy bad-ass motorcycle stuntman JOHNNY BLAZE!!! IT'S such a fun character for Cage to sink his teeth into & create an Awesome leather-jacket wearing demon Anti-hero, it's like it was made for Nicolas Cage.Here a Young Johnny Blaze sells his soul to the Devil, played by Hollywood legend Peter Fonda R.I.P, in order to save his dying dad but in doing that he has become a Warrior from hell that has to carry out kills for the Devil himself.
Johnny Blaze goes against the Devil & becomes a type of Anti-hero but he has the fight against some other powerful demons that want to destroy the world, it's full on Comic-book fantasy stuff.
The cast is rounded out with the always Awesome & rugged, Sam Elliott as a mysterious Caretaker that knows alot about the forces of darkness, also Eva Mendes stars as Roxanne, the love of Johnny Blaze's life. The cast are all great in their roles.
A big great part of this movie is the incredible special effects, especially when Johnny Blaze transforms into the Ghost Rider, with flames pouring out of his face revealing a skull & it's done fantasticly!!! The glowing fire against the dark, gritty & grimy streets is a mesmerising visual treat, the cinematography really is fantastic.
Yes the look of the movie is stunning & the music is Cool & the action is fast & furious!!!
Seeing Ghost Rider riding his moterbike with flames pouring out is just such cool scenes & creates such great imagery.
There's some great bits in here like the police chasing Ghost Rider & he rides up a building, it's so cool & when Ghost Rider gets a mugger & literally scares him to death & lots more great fantasy moments & some Great fight scenes with Ghost Rider using his big flaming chain as a weapon. There's at times a dark atmosphere but it's all in a blockbuster fun kind of way, i see this as an Awesome summer blockbuster movie that was just very misunderstood & underrated in my opinion, put it this way i would rather watch 'Ghost Rider' than an 'Iron-Man' movie or a 'Captain America' movie, nothing against those flicks as i love most of the 'MCU' but 'Ghost Rider' is just simply a more entertaining & enjoyable movie, in my opinion.'GHOST RIDER' is a pure fun, Action-packed Fantasy Thriller with Horror & western elements mixed into a big budget Summer Popcorn movie that's big on fun & full of Cool moments.
Nicolas Cage is literally on Fire here in his role!!!",9,1,1,19 February 2020
I Am Legend," AN EXCELLENT SCI-FI THRILLER & A BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE BY WILL SMITH.
","WILL SMITH is a BRILLIANT actor FACT.
Smith gives a powerful & fantastic performance as the lonely last man survivor in the world,he's Robert Neville & he's surviving in New York City with just his dog but there are others but they are infected zombie types that only come out at night. I am legend is a BRILLIANTLY made sci-fi Horror Thriller that's intense & scary & emotional & that is solely because of WILL SMITH!!! His performance is BRILLIANT,his emotional eyes say it all.A true modern Classic.
Now i love the movie it's a massively budget apocalyptic Horror Thriller but it's not perfect as the infected Dark seekers are all c.g.i & that is never a good thing as i always prefer the practical make up fx & rubber suits it looks more real & grimy & gritty just look at how terrifying the infected zombies was in 28 days later & they was actors in scary as hell make-up no cheap looking c.g.i so THAT was the one problem i had with an otherwise fantastic movie.
The Dark seekers though do look good & are very frantic & scary but you can see they're computer images & that does take a little of the suspense away but the design/look of them is very well done & they are scary.
The mood & atmosphere is very well done with this movie it has a loneliness to it & the music score is very sad with a sense of loss.
Will Smith is truly OUTSTANDING as Robert Neville & shows why he's the greatest movie star on the planet.This is the closest i will ever get to will smith being in a zombie movie or even a Horror movie & as Horror is my favourite genre & smith is my favourite actor this movie means alot to me.
I am legend is an excellent movie & the performance by smith is outstanding so this is an instant CLASSIC in my opinion & yes the infected are well done but c.g.i of course now imagine if they looked like they do but was played by actors like in that excellent 28 days later!!! Would've been AMAZING.I've been a huge Smith fan since the fresh Prince days & have grown up loving him as my idol as an icon & as my childhood hero.
Now 'I Am Legend' is not a Masterpiece but it's one hell of a good sci-fi Thriller & very entertaining",9,4,7,31 July 2018
A Quiet Place," VERY DISAPPOINTING,NOTHING SPECIAL & IT WAS DULL,BORING & ANNOYING.
","This is why i NEVER listen to or believe 'The Critics' this boring drama was very dull,dreary & not very entertaining!!!
I can appreciate the work that went into it but i was only waiting for it to finish when i should have been enjoying this so called 'Masterpiece'
I found it annoying & very Arty & just boring.
Yes there's some good action i suppose but it came off annoying to me & the dad's sacrifice could've been avoided if he just banged something or threw something to distract the creature!!!!
Frustrating & pointless.
The monsters are ok but very similar to everything else especially pitch black & venom.Not what i heard it was like?
Very disappointing",1,2,4,16 July 2019
Unknown," EXCELLENT MYSTERY THRILLER
","I've been loving the rise of Liam Neeson the Action star & he's made some really excellent films like the Taken Trilogy & Non-stop & A walk among the Tombstones & Run all Night & The Grey & Unknown, he's become an aging action legend in his own right.
Neeson gives another solid performance here as a man with a lost memory stuck in a wintery Berlin trying to find out why his wife is saying she doesn't know him after he turns up a few days later with no memory except of her & his own name & has to piece together what the hell is going on?
Unknown is a Classy Mystery Thriller that's filmed in a grim & sickly green that makes everything feel off & looks very grimy & urban gritty, also the dead of winter & snowy setting of Berlin add a cold icey atmosphere to this Clever Mystery that is expertly Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, who also directed Liam Neeson in other excellent Thrillers Non-Stop, Run All Night & The Commuter, so he's a top suspenseful Director who brings out the best Thriller performance from the ageing rugged Neeson, abit of a dream team.
Apart from the good cinematography & tone of this movie it's also got a nice suspense-driven music score & a good little supporting cast with January Jones, Diane Kruger, Aidan Quinn & Frank Langella.
If you enjoy a good solid & exciting Mystery Thriller & like a good Neeson film than Unknown is definitely gonna satisfy.
I love Thriller's & love Neeson flicks so i totally enjoyed this entertaining Thriller that could've easily of been made in the 1990's as a slick Thriller with someone like Michael Douglas for example & that's kinda comforting that this type of straight forward action Thriller is still getting made in these over-blown mega-budget & c.g.i obsessed days of movies.
Unknown is a fun, Mystery popcorn Thriller that's perfect for a Saturday night.",8,0,0,19 April 2020
Ghostbusters," ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!! A MASSIVE PART OF MY CHILDHOOD & MY HEART
","GHOSTBUSTERS is obviously one of the greatest movies ever made EVER.
It's also one of the greatest movies of all time, it's a Masterpiece of Cinema & the best movie ever in my opinion.This is an absolute all time CLASSIC, anyone growing up in the 80's & 90's loved Ghostbusters & it's BRILLIANT underrated Sequel!!!
I love both movies & both are a huge part of why i love MOVIES so much.Now Ghostbusters '84 was always my favourite movie since tiny & other the years i started to like Ghostbusters 2 more & more & claimed it was my favourite movie of all time, but as much as i enjoy & love that sequel i can't help but notice now I'm alot older the things wrong with it!!!
Such as the fallen Statue of liberty & how did it stand back up & get back to where it originally stood? Why did it even fall down?
Also who did that painting at the end of the Busters & baby Oscar?
Also i notice now how bland & cheap looking the cinematography & lighting is in nearly all of the day scenes on the sets such as Dana's Apartment that looks like a cheap set & all the actors are glowing too bright under what i can imagine is a massive lamp!!! Everything is always way too light & clear like a commercial or something, it lost that deep rich & textured cinematography & lighting from the 1984 Classic!!! The river of slime tunnel scenes are probably the best looking but nearly everything else has a cheap look.
I hate saying this about a movie I've always loved & have deep Nostalgia Love for but it's true i still love GHOSTBUSTERS 2, but the first is better in it's quality of production design, look & cinematography.
I think i still like Ghostbusters 2 more though even with it's faults.GHOSTBUSTERS has all great all the elements,cinematography, music, cast,special effects & locations of New York City are absolutely iconic & burned into my mind since being tiny,i have so much Nostalgia & love for these Ghostbusters movie's.
I've been obsessed with Ghostbusters all my life & adore the characters who feel like family to me & everytime i watch these film's it's like seeing old friends again.
Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd) will always be my favourite character in the franchise.
I grew up watching the animated series The Real Ghostbusters, Extreme Ghostbusters, i collected all the Action figures & watched both FILMS on video over & over growing up,so yes i grew up on Ghostbusters.
This movie made me fall in love with New York City for how it looks on screen & the beautiful & detailed cinematography, both films look beautiful!!!
I could go on & on about my love for Ghostbusters & still never completely explain it lol, the truth is Ghostbusters & it's characters touched something in me at a young age like most fans & never let go!!!
Ghostbusters opened my mind & curiosity to the supernatural, PARANORMAL & my sense of wonder about the world.
Ivan Reitman is one of my favourite movie Directors ever, he sits comfortably next to John Carpenter, I've always loved Reitman's films like his 'Kindergarten Cop' & 'Stripes' & 'Twins' & 'Junior' & 'Evolution' & of course his masterpiece films 'Ghostbusters 1&2' he's a legend of cinema.
From the beautiful opening music & into the iconic Library Ghost scene, Ghostbusters is a phenomenal Comedy Horror Classic, with a perfect blend of silly humour & Scary frights, the cast are Amazing & all four busters our like Super heroes to us film geeks!!!
Bill Murray is a Comic genius, Dan Aykroyd is a Comedy legend & fantastic writer, Harold Ramis R.I.P was a fantastic Director & a the brains on screen & good old Ernie Hudson is an underrated Every man of Cinema.Love you Ghostbusters.
Thank you Ivan reitman.
Thank you Dan Aykroyd.
Thank you Harold Ramis R.I.P
Thank you Ernie Hudson.
Thank you Sigourney Weaver.",9,2,2,26 June 2019
Men in Black II," THE MOST CARTOONISH OF THE TRILOGY BUT ALSO THE MOST FUN, ALWAYS LOVED IT.
","Just as Fun this 2nd time around with Men in Black 2!!! Yes part 2 is definitely the most Cartoonish of the series but it's alot of good hearted fun.
A very fun filled fantasy-Comedy that is so underrated, but i loved it & it was really nice seeing Agent J & Agent K back together with alot of fun silly humour & some cool action, there's exciting fx & cool Aliens that make this a totally entertaining film.
I love 'MIB 2' & have changed my mind lots of times of which Men In Black film i love best part 1 or 2, but i have to admit the best made film in the franchise is the 1997 Classic original but this extremely underrated Sequel is just as much fun, it just doesn't have the impact of the first film or a fantastic villain such as the Awesome 'Edgar Bug' but both films are very special to me for different reasons.There's alot of good elements in this sequel that i absolutely love such as the bigger role of Frank the pug & the more fun role of MIB boss Zed played perfectly by the legendary Rip Torn (R.I.P to one of the greats) & the beginning subway scene with Jeff the worm & the sweet relationship between Agent J & Laura (Rosario Dawson) & even evil Serleena is witty & good fun even though she's not as great as the excellent Edgar Bug from the first film, also the bumbling henchman Scrad/Charlie is a fun silly villain played by Johnny Knoxville, there's alot of fun & just great bits to enjoy in an entertaining & light movie.Men in Black 2 is very much like the ridiculously underrated 'Ghostbusters 2' & just like that great movie, such great films but so underrated.
When you Don't have all the origin story to tell you can get right into the new adventure & explore that world more.
I often prefer the sequels over the first films because there's no build up of origins story, we already know the characters so it's straight into the adventure & that's what i found fun with 'MIB 2' & 'Ghostbusters 2' both movies are excellent & both are less liked & extremely underrated of the franchises & both were made 5 years later.
I like what i like & have Never followed what boring 'Critics' say or anyone else, i am my own critic.
I'm not saying 'MIB 2' is a masterpiece or a Classic like the first film & I'm not saying it's perfect because it's not as the main villain is no where near as good as 'Edgar' from the first film & some bits are too silly & childish such as as 'Frank' the pug barking to the terrible song 'Who let the Dogs out?' I can't stand that song!!! & some of the humour is abit too kid-friendly but those are miner small complaints for an otherwise easy watching fun film.'Men in Black 2' has always been so underrated but i genuinely loved it, when it came out i remember going to watch this at the cinema on my own but i didn't care because Will Smith was & still is my idol & childhood hero, i was obsessed with the first film so no way was i going to miss part 2, also i love the look of the warm summer night time scenes of New York City it's beautiful, also the warm chemistry is there again when K comes back & the always great 'Will Smith' is fun silly & at times deeply thoughtful & emotional, it's a calmer more lost & lonely version of Agent J in this sequel, he's had other partners but none last & or have the chemistry he had with Agent K, it's a nice warm performance by Smith.
I love the scene where J sits on a bench after a battle in the subway with the alien 'Jeff' & he's sat there feeling so lost in the universe & it's a nice summer night in the lit-up beautiful city, it's just a lovely touching little scene, it's bits like this that make me love this movie more & respect it's fantasy & emotional stuff even more!!!
I also think i have such big love & Nostalgia for this particular movie because i watched it so much at different times in my life, MIB 2 became a comforting movie for me as i remember feeling so lost & lonely in the world just like 'Agent J' at the beginning of the movie, i kinda related to the character & Will's performance, it's a special film to me.
I consider the 'MIB TRILOGY' to be my favourite movie 'Trilogy' as i loved each film & the 3rd film wrapped it all up really nicely, it's an excellent set of films except now there's a 4th film making this a full on franchise, 'Men In Black International' I've not yet seen as it won't feel the same without Agents k & J!!! Maybe i will give it a watch at some point? Could be good?
But the original Trilogy is pretty much perfect in my opinion.There's something special about Will Smith for me though as i grew up with the 'Fresh Prince of bel air' & his excellent rap music, so Will Smith is something of an icon to me & abit of a positive role model, his films have gotten me through some tough times & MIB 2 along with I,ROBOT are probably the most important films of his to me for personal reasons, those two flicks I've watched so many times at my most lost & loneliest but 'Big Will' was there keeping me comforted but also now Suicide Squad is another favourite of mine.
Movies are special to people for many reasons & MIB 2 holds a very special spot in my heart.Mib 2 is alot of fun & has a nice goofy tone to it but still has some dangerous situations like the first Classic but made more family friendly & goofy, but that great chemistry from Smith & Jones is still perfectly there.
The colourful production design & visual look is fantastic.
I remember buying mib2 as soon as it came out on video & i think i must have watched it nearly every night during that summer!!! It became my late night go to film so yes i still love this underrated sequel.
Men in Black 2 became a 'COMFORT FILM' to me, by that i mean it's one of the films i nearly always put on if i just want to chillout & have something 'feelgood' on in the background that's nice & familiar or even to watch when i can't decide on something i usually put on MIB2, it's nice seeing K & J together & just a joy watching them together & the nice chemistry & flow & music of the movie is really nice & relaxing, it's a nice fantasy escapism flick & i can forget about the dark real world for about 80 mins & just see something fun.
A nice sequel & nice to see my old buddies again on screen Agen K & Agent J.
I adore the MIB franchise, i probably have watched part 2 the most & really have a big soft spot for that sequel, probably my favourite if i had to pick one out of the fantastic trilogy but not the best made that goes to part 1.",9,1,3,22 July 2018
Children of Men," AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF APOCALYPTIC SCI-FI
","Children of Men is a grim & gritty sci-fi Thriller but it's also so much more with it's many messages & in the face look at a not to distant future & one that feels scarily familiar already!!!There's lots under the surface of this Apocalyptic sci-fi Thriller & probably tons of hidden messages about where we're heading but i enjoyed as an exciting & gripping Sci-fi Thriller that is drenched in a real grim & gritty sludge but mainly as a great piece of entertainment & sci-fi filmmaking.
This ain't no Neon-drenched BladeRunner, this is a dirty & raw scruffy future flick that has a sense of realism in it's cinematography & overall look of the future here in England.
This could easily be real, could easily happen & feels real.
The movie is relevant & shocking but also exciting too. Clive Owen gives a great intense performance as an ordinary guy protecting a pregnant lady at a time when there hasn't been a baby born in years, the world is in a panicked & depressed state with no hope. No one gets pregnant anymore & no children anywhere, there's a big mystery to all this & a real sense of loss & sadness, loneliness & desperation is the atmosphere in this Thrilling piece of science fiction.Clive Owen as Theo must get the ONLY pregnant women to a safe place amongst a devastated England that has collapsed & fallen. There's danger everywhere in the year 2027 & it's a dystopian nightmare & feels like no where is safe.
The cast is excellent with the legendary Michael Caine & Julianne Moore is excellent roles.
This is probably the best movie Clive Owen has made? It's definitely one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made.An intense & gritty survival Thriller set in a scary world",9,0,0,21 April 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," GREAT FUN IN THIS FANTASTIC SCI-FI FANTASY ADVENTURE
","Guardians of the galaxy is just lots of fun with great characters & is definitely one of Marvels best movies.Guardians of the galaxy looks Amazing, i mean beautiful with it's production design & stunningly
created look, it's a work of detailed art. Everything in this film looks Amazing & top notch as it should be with it's huge mega budget & it's all splashed accross the screen for us to enjoy. This is one of best looking sci-fi films ever made in my opinion & IT'S definitely one of Marvels most fun & entertaining films.
The tone is fun, humorous & exciting but still with plenty of danger for our odd crew of space heroes. The characters are such a fun & an odd mix & it all works perfectly. I loved the characters & Chris Pratt is great as the funny lead hero here as Peter Quill aka: 'Starlord' the Junker & it's still his best movie role, also Dave Bautista is excellent as the extremely tough warrior out for revenge named Drax, also we get a funny gun-toting Raccoon named Rocket, a big tree creature named Groot & a sexy green assassin named Gamora. One Cool odd-ball crew of Space warriors for one big fun adventure with outstanding special effects & a well crafted story & some of the most beautiful sets & backgrounds I've ever seen in a sci-fi flick!!!
The whole prison set piece is Amazing & this Crew is a Group you wanna hang out with & watch again & again.
With an Awesome soundtrack too & plenty of great moments & standout action scenes makes this pure fun entertainment.
Truly a Marvel great that is full of style, wit, fun & pure Awesomeness.",9,1,2,18 April 2020
The Evil Dead," STILL THE BEST OF THE FRANCHISE!!! A HORROR CLASSIC
","I grew up watching the BRILLIANT evil dead trilogy & love all 3 movies, my favourite was probably Army of Darkness but now i would say NOTHING beats the terrifying & gruesome 1981 original Horror MASTERPIECE!!! 
The original is pure Horror & is a gritty low-budget gross demonic possession flick before it went all comical, Ash was more of a terrified coward here but he was more real & full of fear like anyone would be!!! 
The setting is scary as hell & the atmosphere is full of dread & it's all very well made on that tiny budget.
A true scary old school Horror classic that used to terrifying me as a kid & still today it's scary as well as being crazy disgusting fun. 
Evil Dead (1981) really is a true Horror movie with amazing monster fx done with a tiny budget so this really is a Horror CLASSIC & the brilliant director Sam Raimi's MASTERPIECE",10,8,11,11 August 2018
Saw II," A FANTASTIC FEROCIOUS SEQUEL
","The first Saw film is the best of the franchise i think but this first sequel is easily the best of the sequels & to be honest i only own & love parts 1&2, this sequel does up the sick & twisted games & bloodshed & it's so much fun!!!
I love the big old building that the entire film is set within & it gives a sense of claustrophobic improvement & an intense mood & all the traps & trials are brutally twisted such as the most disturbing one here the 'Needle Pit' a shocking sequence, a great twisted Gory as hell Horror-Thriller with a good solid cast & the always good on screen Donnie Wahlberg, i like this dude as an actor & yes he's such much like his brother Mark lol but Donnie has become a more B-movie actor than a big movie star like Mark & he's always good to watch & usually pops up as a Detective in many flicks, he starred as a Cop in James Wan's AWESOME atmospheric Horror Dead Silence & here he's a tough cop on the edge & plays his role perfectly. The rest are all fine in their small roles.
An excellent sequel & genuinely a well made, well filmed Flick & a great follow-up to the Cult Classic original",8,0,0,26 June 2020
From Dusk Till Dawn," ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF THE AWESOME 90's, MY MOST WATCHED VIDEO & ONE OF MY TOP 5 FAVE FILMS
","I love this film so much & have watched a ridiculous amount of times since owning it on video when it first came out but i will admit that even more now as I'm older, i do think that George Clooney was slightly miscast as Seth. I since have found out the Underrated but great, Joe Pilato (Day of the Dead '85) was set to play Seth & oh my he would've been perfect & also in my opinion the also underrated Robert Davi or the also underrated William Forsythe both could've played the part of tough & foul mouthed Criminal Seth, but it is what it is & it's still Clooney's best role & film by far & he's not bad at all but he's just not very convincing as a tough-nut. Still 'Seth' is a Cool Character & the part shot Clooney to the big stars & like i said he's good & Cool but there's other's who could've pulled the part off probably better.This was a huge film in the 90's a massive instant cult classic & has gotten better & better as the years have gone on.
This rugged flick is a perfect 'Late Night' Film.
I first saw this great movie when i rented it on video way back in '96 or '97? I think? But anyway it looked cool on the cover & i thought it was another Crime Thriller like pulp fiction or reservoir dogs so i was so shocked when it turned into a vampire Horror film!!! Such a great twist & one that could not be kept secret today with social media!!!
I'm so glad i grew up in the 90's it was so much better back then & i remember hot summer nights up late watching Dusk Till Dawn over & over i even took it a sleepover when i just brought it on video & introduced some friends to it's brilliance & i had the movie soundtrack & constantly listened to it so yeah i was obsessed with this CLASSIC movie & still am.
From Dusk Till Dawn means a hell of alot to me for so many reasons & at that time in the 90's i was so into Quentin Tarantino i was watching Reservoir dogs & Pulp fiction & same with Rodriguez i was watching Desperado so the team up was a beautiful thing.
From Dusk Till Dawn also opened up a cinema world to me a movie world as it introduced me to old school B-movie stars & Horror icons such as Fred Williamson & Tom Savini & i was a huge fan of both after this vampire film plus i became a big Danny Trejo fan too so my mind was full of this new movie world created by Tarantino & Rodriguez.A nice shock twist & some fantastic characters in this excellent film i mean Seth played well by George Clooney was such a cool, smooth & tough guy character he was AWESOME!!!
Also 'Sex Machine' played by the Horror legend, Tom Savini was a fantastic character & Frost played by the cool as hell B-movie legend Fred Williamson!!! What an excellent cast, Harvey keitel,Juliette lewis,Danny trejo & even Tarantino himself all delivering solid performances, A Fantastic cast. Also the Crime Thriller first half is excellent & brilliantly scripted & shot it's exciting & brutal & then we have the crazy horror second half with some of the greatest vampire FX ever put on screen!!! These are ALSO the best looking/designed vampires in any horror movie ever!!! This is a true Cult CLASSIC & a genuine CLASSIC movie!!!
There's been nothing like it or as good since!!! A dusty 70's style road crime Thriller & an 80's style creature feature mixed hybrid that works perfectly & is one of my favourite films of all time it's in my top 5.
This really is a crazy & fun, wild ride from a suspenseful Crime Thriller to a Monster Siege Horror. There's lots of great humour sprinkled throughout too & some great characters.Yes i spent many late nights up watching From Dusk Till Dawn & have great nostalgia & memories of this AWESOME movie & i went & brought a book on Tarantino after seeing this it was called King of Pulp.
This is easily one of my most watched films of all time & i still know every word it's one of the best scripts for a movie ever!!! Ridiculously quotable & Cool as hell.
Infact there's no film out there as Cool & exciting as From Dusk Till Dawn in my opinion.
My video of this was on fire i watched it that much & it still amazes me that it flips from a proper Tarantino style Crime Thriller into a full blown Vampire Horror film.
It's a unique brilliantly directed movie by the legendary Robert Rodriguez & written by the legendary Tarantino so two BRILLIANT minds at work created this masterpiece.
From Dusk Till Dawn owns a big piece of my movie loving Heart & still is the GREATEST vampire movie ever made in my opinion.A little update here as recently a short 2 min promo trailer for From Dusk Till Dawn came out in 1991 directed by legendary fx guy Robert Kurtzman & starring day of the dead star JOE PILATO as Seth Gecko!!! I was shocked it's a little teaser trailer to help raise money for the project at the time back in '91 & i have to admit it that Joe pilato would have made a fantastic & way better Seth Gecko yes a better choice than George Clooney in my opinion as Joe looks tougher & more intense & seems more deadly like a Criminal should & he has that nice back history of being one of the most famous Horror movie villains of all time as Captain Rhodes from Day of the Dead (1985) another Romero zombie CLASSIC.
Also Joe Pilato was the FIRST to wear the Black suit/white shirt & thin black tie that's become iconic because of Reservoir dogs & Pulp fiction but Joe Pilato was the first!!!
If you watch the promo trailer he looks so cool & his hair is fairly long & slick back & i can see that TARANTINO copied his entire look on to John Travolta as vince in Pulp fiction now I've seen this i honestly think that role of vince as well as Seth should have gone to the great Joe Pilato R.I.P!!! I actually think Tarantino made some wrong choices now for not using a better older genre actor who Tarantino himself was a huge fan of but hey that's my movie mind over thinking as usual but yes pilato would've made a better seth & a better vince & he should have definitely been cast as a reservoir dog!!!!
Anyway some films from our childhood or just growing up stick with us for life & this fun Vampire Thriller definitely has stuck with me & owns a special place in my heart along with 'Jaws' & 'Dragnet' & 'Ghostbusters 2' & 'Big trouble in little China' & some other's that i consider to be in my all time top 10 fave movies!!!
I loved & lived the Awesome 90s & 'From Dusk Till Dawn' was a huge part of that defining era of films for me, even though we as movie geeks
Grow & watch alot more films & maybe our tastes even change abit & we enjoy more sophisticated 'Drama' films or 'Epic' films or even 'Historical' films, we always come back to those 'good memory' & Nostalgic films & remember just why we loved them so much back then!!!
I have a big bunch of films that i call my 'Comfort Films' & those flicks are my safety net from the cold, cruel & harsh Adult world, i can go into my little movie world & feel safe again.I also loved the low budget straight to video sequel starring Robert Patrick.",10,0,1,21 August 2018
Clash of the Titans," A GOOD FANTASY ADVENTURE BUT A BORING BLAND LEAD IN SAM WORTHINGTON.
","I grew up on the old early 80's version of 'Clash of the Titans' & that was a great film with a terrifying Medusa that is an iconic creature design so i wasn't sure about giving this a watch for a long time but I'm so glad i decided to watch it as a double bill of Monster movies with 'Kong: Skull Island' & really enjoyed both films!!!
This version of the Classic tale & remake of the old school Classic is excellent, i TOTALLY enjoyed the look & effort put into the amazing production design & incredible creatures put on screen.
Now Medusa didn't look as scary as the old version but obviously with todays special fx she moved & looked real enough to still be very sinister, i prefer Sam Worthington in the main lead role as he's a tougher looking hero as Perseus, he was much more Manly & harder in this more grittier & darker version BUT although Sam Worthington looked the part he didn't have much else about him, he's obviously a good looking guy so he probably got picked for a 'Handsome lead' but anyone really could've played the part & much better as its not a big 'Acting' role but yeah 'Worthington' is a bland lead actor really but he was ok for a moody scowling angry looking Australian guy lol & he seemed tough.
I would've preferred the excellent Barry Pepper in the lead role or even Tom Hardy.
The different creatures are Awesome & look Amazing thanks to a nice big budget & the ancient Greek Mythological world is created fully & looks Fantastic.
The always excellent Liam Neeson is good here too as the god 'Zues' & Ralph Fiennes is very sinister as the evil god 'Hades' so there's a great solid cast of excellent actors here along with some beautiful ladies like Gemma Arterton & Alexa Devalos & Polly Walker & more stunning faces along with the tough manly warriors.The huge Scorpions look Amazing & it's an Awesome battle scene & the Medusa scene is exciting & creepy & there's plenty more great monster scenes & battles in this huge Exciting Fantasy fun big creature feature adventure. A remake that is better than the original as it's a big budget peice of fantasy adventure fun.",8,0,1,31 December 2019
Jurassic World," NOT THAT GOOD & NO GOOD CHARACTERS
","I really didn't like any of the characters in this movie, the two boys were annoying & Chris Pratt wasn't very good here i mean i got nothing against him but here in his role he seemed too cocky & abit of an A-hole to me!!! He's better in the remake of The Magnificent Seven & he's Awesome & hilarious in Guardians of the galaxy & the Marvel films but nothing about him is interesting at all here in his lead role!!!
Everything was obviously all over the top c.g.i but it had some good bits but the heart was missing for me & the fact that raptors could be trained & be good was too silly
Nothing special at all & the original Trilogy is way better still.",5,0,1,6 April 2020
Black Hawk Down," A RAW REAL TO LIFE SURVIVAL WAR STORY, EXCELLENT.
","'Black Hawk Down' was a huge hit way back in early 2000's & i loved it from the first time i rented it from Blockbuster on video!!!
I was already a Josh Hartnett fan from Halloween H20, The Faculty & Pearl Harbour & yes i like those films & think Hartnett is a very good yet way underrated actor, he's a solid intense actor who proved himself once again as a great leading man with his excellent performance in 30 Days of Night (2009) & here in Black Hawk Down he's great once again but this time he's part of a big ensemble cast.This shockingly violent & gritty real to life true story of survival war film is set in a hot zone war torn part of Somalia, a group of US Army Rangers get caught in an extremely violent conflict of war in the most dangerous hostile part of the city & basically have to run & fight their way out to safety, it's an intense & scary situation with bullets wizzing by not stop & angry violent Somalia warriors everywhere hunting down our soldiers.
The huge excellent ensemble cast has lots of good actors & know the face types, we have of course Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Orlando Bloom, Tom Hardy,
Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, William Fichtner, Kim Coates & more!!!
This is also excellently directed by legendary Ridley Scott & boasts fast paced intense action & exciting edge of the seat moments, the cinematography is sharp & raw that shows the grittiness of the broken war torn city, this is one of the greatest war films ever made in my opinion.
The fact this actually happened is very scary & makes everything even more intense & emotional.
Just a fantastic survival tale in a deadly savage place where killing is common everyday acts.",9,1,1,9 December 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A MARVEL MASTERPIECE!!!
","Age of ultron actually beats the brilliant first film, i absolutely LOVED Avengers Assemble & Age of ultron is an even better film than that!!!The opening scene is action packed excitement, the Avengers are on a mission & are battling Hydra soldiers through a snowy forest & it's a breathtakingly beautiful sequence!!!
Captain America is still my favourite Avenger, he's the lost relic from another time & he remains loyal & is the heart of the Avengers.
This superb sequel really grabbed me & pulled me into this fantasy world with this amazing team of crime fighters, you really care for these characters & that's how well written they are & the world they exist in!!!The chemistry between the Avengers team is great, playful & fun but full of heart, the team bounce off of each other, they became great friends & are a joy to watch together.I found this outstanding sequel to be more grittier, Darker in tone & atmosphere & more heartfelt, there's a great depth to this story & it's characters, the script is superb it's fantastic writing.
Each Avenger is given plenty of room to shine & really grow as a character especially Natasha (Black Widow) She is excellent & really shines as one of the greatest & bravest of the team!!! A fantastic performance from Scarlett Johansson, also Hawkeye is given alot more depth to his own story, we find out he has a pregnant wife & two kids, there's a warm touching scene where the Avengers hide out at his big country house & meet his family.
There's so many great character moments & stunning action scenes.The Nightmare scenes that each Avenger suffers after the witch plays with their minds is so well done it plays out like a Horror movie, very creepy & dark scenes.
Ultron is a Terrifying villain, an Artificial intelligence nightmare robot who creates an army of deadly robots to destroy earth, he's genuinely creepy & very menacing, a much better villain than Loki in my opinion.The directing, the music, the acting, the action & the characters are all done perfectly.
Probably the best Avengers film in my opinion & one of the greatest comic book films ever MADE!!!",10,0,0,19 August 2019
Men in Black," 'MIB' OWNS A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART & WILL SMITH IS MY CHILDHOOD HERO!!!
","Yes we all know that MIB (1997) is an absolute CLASSIC FILM!!! Everything about this movie is perfect & i loved this film ever since i first watched it at the cinema way bk in the summer of '97 & always remember when WILL SMITH name came up at the beginning all the girls cheered!!! WOW Will Smith is a super star & I've been a fan since 'Fresh Prince' & he's my favourite actor, I've been watching Smith since then & this movie is a huge piece of Nostalgia for me & owns a piece of my movie loving heart along with the 'Ghostbusters' films!!!
Some films you just love, you can't get enough of it & always come back to a certain or a few main films & mine are 'Men In Black' & 'Ghostbusters 2' & 'Dragnet' & 'MIB2' & 'The Fog 1980' & 'Jaws' among a few other's & these certain movies seem to have had a huge impact on me & i mean so much to me but if i had to narrow it all done to a single movie that i cherish the most it would be the JAWS, followed closely 'Ghostbusters 2' but & 'MIB' . My favourite actor Will Smith in his most iconic role & the magical genius pairing of mr.Smith & the Hollywood veteran legend Mr.Jones, i adore both actors & love Rip Torn too, i love his voice R.I.P. all cement MIB as a Classic from the 1990's
I think i love this film so much is because it's always been there from my late nights up watching it on video during the 90's & Men In Black became a 'Comfort Film' to me & i would put it on so much that it was simply comforting to have it playing in the background & hearing the voices of these guys from like hanging out & seeing old friends again, strange maybe but true to how I've always felt about this film but my love for this particular film has bern resurrected as i loved it as the best film ever i think through the 90's but fell back into my love for my childhood favourite 'Ghostbusters' but now i appreciate the 'MIB' even more so now as I'm a 35yr old guy who is still a huge Will Smith fan & he's still my favourite actor ever, & i can look at it the from a much more older/grown-up/mature view & i fell in love with this wonderful feelgood sci-fi buddy Comedy even more!!!. Also as an adult i feel this movie is even more special as we're now in a movie world crammed with way over budget & way over the top huge C.G.I bloated films & so my very 90's Men In Black film feels much more relaxed & easy going in flow & much more character based than c.g.i fx based, back then the Alien Creatures were mostly Animatronics & puppets with some c.g.i but now everything is c.g.i mad!!!
The Amazing legendary creatures designer 'Rick Baker' created everything special & slimey on screen so what you saw was a work of Art & hard work but now it's cheap looking computer fx & often feels soulless.
There's too many perfect elements that came together to create this wonderful film & that's why it deserves to be a 'CLASSIC' movie & it definitely is.
MIB is perfect escapism from the real world. The cast is perfect, i mean the great Tommy Lee Jones partners with the super star Will Smith works perfectly with hilarious chemistry comic timing & the Biggest villain 'EDGAR' is one of the greatest villains ever created & that's because of vincen d'onofrios amazing & funny as hell performance. Everything just works perfectly including the comedy & the incredible iconic music & the fun tone & the action & the Awesome creatures, it's truly a CLASSIC & WILL SMITH on top blockbuster form.
The 90's was Awesome & this movie was one of the biggest films of that era to impact me & made me love Will Smith even more so & got me very interested in U.F.O's which i believe in as I've seen one!!!
MIB is one of those just BRILLIANT films where everything just works perfectly from the amazing cast & special fx & Beautiful music score by Danny Elfman & excellent production design & Amazing script & Comic-Sci-fi tone & all the fantasy elements to the pure 90's comforting cinematography & the lovely New York City setting during the summertime.
New York City is a big character for our main characters to explore & for the 'Aliens' to try & live normal average lives within the beautiful city.
I love the easy watching & easy flowing tone to this movie, it's such a nice feelgood watch & ridiculously entertaining!!!
This is definitely one of my most watched films of all time & i think i wore out my old video of it long ago.
it's a Classic sci-fi film & one of the biggest & best films of the 90's as Well as an important movie for me as it made such a huge impact on me growing up, i love this film.
The main charm of this film is it's pure escapism fun & nice banter-full chemistry between 'Smith' & 'Jones' & the great 'Rip Torn' (RIP) is fantastic as Zed, the hit song by Will Smith has cemented this as a true 90's MASTERPIECE & time capsule of that time. I had the action figures to this film too & the soundtrack Album, oh the memories & Nostalgia are strong with this one.I have massive Nostalgia for this movie massive 90's Nostalgia as that was my era,my growing up years as a young teen & was obsessed with Men in Black & Will Smith.
This first MIB movie is truly a Classic & one of my most watched & beloved movies i remember the summer it came out & i remember talking to my friends about it at school it was great times & collecting the awesome action figures & books of the film & posters, so yes this movie has had a huge impact on me growing up just like the Ghostbusters films did too.
Will Smith at his absolute best & i love Smith in his great later films like 'I,Robot' & 'I Am Legend' & 'Suicide Squad' & others but his first 'MIB' film is the landmark movie that changed everything for this quick rising mega star, his 'ID4' was obviously a huge hit but 'MIB' cemented Smith as a global blockbuster movie star with charm & quick witted humour,goofiness & yet brave,Cool & heartfelt image, he became a Legend of Hollywood.
As much as i Love most of his film especially I,Robot,MIB 2,I Am Legend, ID4,Bad Boys,Enemy of the State,MIB 3,Suicide Squad, Wild Wild West, Bright & Aladdin among other great films it's his 1997 first Men in Black film that i mostly come back to or well along with MIB2, as this is the most iconic Will Smith on screen as Agent J & it's such a good character & his MIB performance & work i think will be what Will Smith will be remembered for mostly within the movie world. A perfect blend of sci-fi Action & buddy Comedy, so thank you 'Barry Sonnenfield' for directing this masterpiece!!! I could be Happy watched this movie everyday of my life, i wouldn't get bored & it wouldn't still Cheer me up & make me laugh. One of my favourite movie's of the 90's is 'MIB' & my favourite movie of the early 2000's is 'I,Robot' these flicks are important to me as a film lover & geek.
Will Smith was a childhood hero of mine from his 'Fresh Prince' days & has remained my hero still today!!!
There's lots of actors that i love & grew up watching & are also hero's to me (Eddie Murphy, Schwarzenegger, Estevez, Aykroyd, Chase, Roy Scheider, among others) but it's Mr. Smith that has had the most important impact on me throughout my life. The world is definitely a little bit better with Will Smith in it with us.",10,0,0,2 August 2018
Midsommar," A DISTURBING & MESMERISING SHOCKER MASTERPIECE
","WOW!!! 'Midsommar' is one brilliantly made disturbing Horror Thriller, it's a slow burning tight trip into terror & it's done beautifully & eerily with a sense of dread hanging over everything all the time, a masterful piece of Cinema.
Now I can totally understand all the excellent reviews & see this as a definite instant CLASSIC.
The performance from the main girl Florence Pugh as 'Dani' was absolutely outstanding, she gave it her all in an extremely emotional & raw performance & was easily the best actor & character in the movie.
The beginning scenes were depressing,shocking & unsettling in itself & that was just abit of 'Dani's' backstory & her family but that was so intense & dark even before we get to The shockingly scary summer festival in Sweden!!!
Dani has been through a hell of alot with her family dying tragically & she suffers from depression & panic attacks & this movie is really her story & journey.
Dani & her useless boyfriend & a few friends go to Sweden for some summer festivities & learn the different culture but as expected the weird over nice village place is a haven for a Cult.
You already know exactly what is gonna happen & who will die but when it does happen IT'S shocking & disturbing, i can see the idea may have come from the 70's Classic 'The Wicker Man' & Midsommar is just as shocking & scary!!!
Dani's boyfriend & his mates are useless idiots & Dani is the only smart & fully aware person there that fears the strange place & can really see how weird it is but the others just seem to go along, Dani is a fantastic character.
There is a very raw feel to it & an incredibly intense atmosphere that's gripping all the way through from the shocking beginning to the disturbing ending, Midsommar is a terrifying new modern Horror Thriller MASTERPIECE!!!
Some of the imagery is very scary & some scenes of violence is savage & shocking with realism & harshness, this is not a film i could watch lots but i TOTALLY can appreciate what a BRILLIANT work of art this movie is & how well it's MADE.
A standout performance from Florence Pugh & an incredibly directed shocker by Ari Aster who is a masterful powerful Director.",9,10,19,8 January 2020
Taken," AWESOME DARK & BRUTAL VIGILANTE ACTION THRILLER
","Well 'Taken' was the film that turned ageing serious & excellent actor Liam Neeson into a tough quick fighting Action hero & hes great here as ex- special Agent one man killing machine Bryan Mills!!!
This kick-started an Action franchise for Neeson & totally revitalised his Career to a bigger Audience & now he's up there with the Action greats.'TAKEN' is a very real to life horrific story about Sex-trafficking that goes on in the world all over but here this story is set in France.
The teenage daughter of 'Bryan Mills' goes on vacation with her best friend to stay in France but almost immediately are captured & by evil Sex-trafficking scum & then that sets in motion a violent quest for Bryan Mills to hunt & kill those responsible.
Famke Janssen plays the ex-wife of Bryan Mills & mother to their teenage Girl played by Maggie Grace & the grizzled Neeson gives a fantastic angry & deadly performance as Bryan Mills & uses his skills to track & exterminate the vile scum who do this stuff & the action is brutal tense & gritty with Neeson even torturing some of the scum to get the answers he wants!!!
I loved Neeson here & wish there was guys like him really out there killing off the evil scum of the world as they all deserve to die in my opinion!!!'TAKEN' is a tight & tense dark Action Thriller with an Awesome Neeson taking out the trash!!!
The film is fast paced & relentless but the very 'Happy Ending' didn't work but all in all IT'S one exciting solid revenge Action Thriller",8,1,2,1 January 2020
Sinister," TRULY TERRIFYING & SCARY AS HELL WITH AN OUTSTANDING ETHAN HAWKE PERFORMANCE
","'SINISTER' is truly a terrifying experience, especially when i watched it at the Cinema but even since then I've watched it a few times & each viewing is still utterly terrifying lol!!!I would say that 'SINISTER' is an instant classic or even a Horror masterpiece or a future Cult Classic & I've given it a 9/10 instead of a full 10/10 only because the ending is too depressing & disturbing, but the movie is fantastically made.We get an outstanding performance by Ethan Hawke as a struggling writer who moves his family to a small town & moves into a house where real murders happened & some real sinister things start to happen, he thinks this creepy place will help give him inspiration to write a magnificent book on his true crime story of which happened at the house he's now living in.
Hawke as Ellison is excellent here as his descent into utter terror is gripping & disturbing, this is a shocker that drips pure terror & dread in it's Atmosphere, mood & look.
The movie looks fantastic & the scares are as frightening as can be for a Horror flick, especially a Horror flick about the supernatural!!!
Another major thing here that stands out is it's ridiculously terrifying soundtrack, the music score is completely engulfing with it's creepy sounds & almost suffocating noises that make everything feel so claustrophobic & full of dread!!! This Horror movie is crafted to be one to always remember & as a life long Horror movie fan not much still scares me but this film still makes me feel uncomfortable & unsettled after watching it, it's a powerful Horror film & one of the absolute best of the whole Genre.",9,1,2,21 January 2020
Reservoir Dogs," TARANTINO'S BRILLIANT BLOOD SOAKED DEBUT MASTERPIECE
","RESERVOIR DOGS was always my favourite of Tarantino's films growing up in the 90's, most people loved 'Pulp fiction' the best, yes it's also BRILLIANT but i like the simplicity of his masterpiece Debut movie & his brilliant 'Jackie Brown' infact it's his 90's films that completely gripped me into the world of Tarantino!!! My love has grown more now for the smart & intriguing storytelling & characters of his underrated Jackie Brown but his low-budget Cracking Crime Thriller RESERVOIR DOGS will always be my favourite Tarantino movie & one of my favourite movies ever!!!! His little Heist Flick is a memorable, iconic & extraordinary piece of filmmaking & one that i hold close to my movie loving heart.
I absolutely love his '90s Trilogy' as i call it as each film was outstanding, Reservoir dogs, Pulp Fiction & Jackie Brown, what a set of films by probably the greatest director of all time!!!Anyway back to the dogs,
I love the 'set in one place' situation such as the meeting place warehouse where all the intense drama happens after the robbery has gone wrong.TARANTINO shows how great he is from the beginning scene in the Cafe with the crew of criminals chatting & having Coffee together, here the witty & fun dialogue shines right through, it's funny & smart & so different from any other movie as this is a Tarantino movie & it's already unique.I grew up in the 90's & Tarantino was the Coolest Director out there, his films were all hit instant CLASSIC's such as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction & Jackie Brown plus From Dusk Till Dawn that he didn't direct but was a main star in it as well as producing it & he had written it, so Tarantino was huge.
Reservoir dogs remains a tight, intense & powerful Crime Thriller before Tarantino got longer & more talkative with his films, this remains a simple story that's not too long but is filled with Cool characters & excellent performances!!!
Reservoir dogs is a blood soaked masterpiece of Neo noir Crime & great story telling.This is probably still my favourite Tarantino film, I'm huge fan of his work as he is truly a genius but hey each film he crafts is excellent!!!I could watch this movie over & over again it's that great & smart, Reservoir dogs is such a Nostalgic 90's CLASSIC & for a debut film it's pretty much a MASTERPIECE.
I feel a connection with the genius Tarantino as i love movies like he does, i understand that obsession & I'm a movie geek too & i feel much safer in my movie world than i do in the horrible real world, the film world makes sense to me but not reality!!!
The 90's were the best for Tarantino though in my opinion as i have big Nostalgia for his first 3 films. A funny & compelling little low-key Genre film that is basically a cheap B-movie but crafted like a 'big' movie thanks to the genius of Tarantino.",10,1,1,10 August 2019
Don't Breathe," BRILLIANT!!! AN INSTANT CLASSIC BEST FILM IN YEARS
","Don't Breathe is an instant CLASSIC in MY OPINION!!!
This is a BRILLIANTLY made suspense urban Thriller that is actually scary & very intense.
The abandoned Detroit neighbourhood that this is set in is creepy as hell, the old house that the blind man lives in is creepy too, infact the atmosphere in this movie is edge of the seat intensity, All the actors are FANTASTIC & give excellent performances especially the scary 'Stephen Lang' as the blind man ,'Dylan Minnette' & 'Jane Levy' all amazing!!! This is one hell of an exciting Thriller that feels so real & gritty & very exciting!!!
The cinematography is outstanding & you see that in the birds eye view shots of the old decrepit run-down Detroit neighbourhood, very creepy & well shot, an urban nightmare!!!
All the actors & characters are EXCELLENT!!!
everything about this film is excellent movie making & made with a real love for the dark Thriller genre, even down to the BRILLIANT creepy atmospheric music & an atmosphere full of loneliness & dread.
DON'T BREATHE really is a true instant CLASSIC & has already become one of my favourite movies of all time!!!
One of my favourite Thriller films & just a beautifully made Thriller that i consider abit of a companion piece to 'Judgment Night' the 1993 urban survival Thriller starring 'Emelio Estevez' both share similar themes & both are about a small group of young people trying to survive the night in an urban nightmare world whilst being hunted!!! Now 'Judgment Night' is surviving on the scary streets of Night time Chicago & 'Don't Breathe' is a group trapped in a big old house of Horror but set in an urban nightmare world too, the abandoned & apocalyptic looking Detroit, so both share the theme of the 'out of your territory' & both plays to that really scary urban-decay inner city nightmare world!!! Both CLASSIC films & make a great Double feature.",10,1,2,3 August 2018
Inside Man," TOO COMICAL & BORING
","I love Denzel Washington & he's easily one of the greatest actors in cinema history but in this film he's not used right & the film has a silly comical tone to it all so you can't take it seriously!!!
Denzel is brilliant in action Thriller films but this film is so boring & thr fact it doesn't take itself serious makes it all feel pointless",1,0,2,27 April 2020
Pulp Fiction," A CLASSIC 90's MESMERIZING CRIME DRAMA
","Everyone know's the huge impact Tarantino's 'PULP FICTION' had in the 90's, it was huge & is still considered one of the greatest movies ever made,No need to talk about the story as everyone who loves movies knows all about it.
Tarantino was like a rock star by the time his masterpiece 2nd film came out, Reservoir dogs was an instant CLASSIC & everyone knew the name Tarantino, as a film geek turned amazing film director he touched us movie geeks big time, Tarantino was one of us film obsessed nerds who made it to directing what he loved about cinema.
I love Tarantino & think he's probably the greatest director of all time along with John Carpenter.
His 90's films were & are still my favourite of his as that's when the impact of his genius hit me, i was obsessed with From Dusk Till Dawn which he starred in & co-wrote but was directed by his friend the equally excellent ROBERT RODRIGUEZ, we had Tarantino's blood soaked debut 'RESERVOIR DOGS', his masterpiece 'PULP FICTION' & his truly BRILLIANT 'JACKIE BROWN' it was a great time for his films & pure genius.
I was lucky enough to have grown up in the 90's & being obsessed with anything Tarantino related,
Pulp fiction is a masterpiece of cinema, it's a crime tale that's a gritty crime drama & ultra violent Thriller, there's hilarious humour & intense situations & Classic moments, Pulp Fiction is the movie that everyone still talks about & is one of the best reviewed films in cinema history!!!
I love this movie & it's amazing cast.
Tarantino's 90's films are still my favourite of his amazing career.Quentin Tarantino & Robert Rodriguez were heroes to me growing up & still are but the 90's was their hey day & the best for both of their genius to explode on the screen.",10,0,1,24 August 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A GREAT SEQUEL & JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST
","Vol.2 was spectacular fun & just as good as the first if not better!!!
This sequel was a blast of intergalactic fun but this time with a whole lot more Heart. Our Guardian's of the Galaxy this time end up on a new strange planet when they are invited there by a God-like man named EGO, who apparently is Peter Quills long lost father but things don't seem right & there's a big sinister plot & our heroes have to once again save the Galaxy. That's the basic storyline here & it's well done with some new faces on screen like two absolute legends of Cinema, Kurt Russell as Ego & Sylvester Stallone as an old ravenger who used to work with Yondu, named Stakar Ogord. Great having these two legends enter this MCU as i grew up watching & loving these guys & they starred together as partners in the Classic Action Cop Thriller 'Tango & Cash' from way back in the 80's. Also there's much more emotional depth to all the characters this time & makes us care for this time & like them even more. Yondu (Played greatly again by Michael Rooker) has so much more depth to his rugged, angry & deadly Ravenger here that we get to understand him & find out what he's done for Peter Quill. Baby Groot is absolutely adorable & so cute that he steals the show & Peter Quill aka: Starlord gets much more emotional depth with his past catching up to him with a few surprises. All the characters get lots of time to shine here & even Rocket opens up more too!!!
The special effects are as always Amazing & the comedy is just right with plenty of fun comments & banter between our group & that's why is such a fun movie as we love to hang out with this group of misfits & the love of this team is on full display by the end.
A blast of thrilling adventure, stunning set pieces, witty humour, beautiful colourful cinematography, good music & lots of Action make this one great big budget blockbuster popcorn extravaganza. Fun for the whole family, we all loved it.",9,0,0,30 April 2020
The Happening," I LOVED THIS ATMOSPHERIC & EXCITING HORROR THRILLER!!!
","I don't understand the silly hate for this film & i NEVER listen the boring critics that never like anything unless it's like that boring piece of crap 'Citizen Kane' & i loved M.Night Shyamalan's Creepy Apocalyptic Thriller & it's my favourite of all his movies!!!
I loved Signs & The Sixth Sense & Unbreakable & The Village & Split & i even liked After Earth & The Lady in the Water but i enjoyed his 'The Happening' most of all.
Now some of the acting from Mark Whailberg is very corny, silly & goofy but hey this is a fun throwback 50's or 70's style B-movie so it's fine in that regard & Whailberg is fun as science teacher Elliot Moore & really does come accross as that very 50's or 70's style smart scientist lead, i liked his character & his easy going nice guy performance, & what is really great about this fun little Thriller is the simple story that is very old school nature vs us, like the paranoid old school films like 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' & 'The Birds' & many other fun B-movie survival films of those times.
'The Happening' is suspenseful & exciting apocalyptic fun & it starts with lots of unexplained suicides & those scenes are very creepy & the amazing beautiful music score by James Newton Howard is hauntingly lovely & affective, this film is full of an atmosphere of dread & fear as our small group of survivors are running from an unseen killer & that's what's really clever is the 'Killer' of this sci-fi Horror Thriller is deadly toxins released from plants, trees & grass & those toxins infect humans & then theu kill others & themselves, it's actually a terrifying idea & it's executed perfectly by Shyamalan!!!
'The Happening' is definitely drenched in that 70's paranoia of a collapsing environment like 'Soylent Green' & 'The Omega Man' i love those movies & The Happening fits in that genre with them, man vs nature & the fears of our destroyed & polluted environment!!!
What are we doing to our world?
It's all here in the tense Atmosphere.The cast is solid with Elliott Moore's troubled girlfriend 'Alma Moore' played by Zooey Deschanel, she comes accross abit weird really & kinda detached but she's ok nothing special here but Elliott's best friend & fellow teacher 'Julian' played by the always great John Leguizamo is a great character & an intense & panicking performance by John & another standout & very creepy performance is from Veteran actor Betty Buckley as Mrs. Jones & she's great in her small but very sinister role!!!All in all 'The Happening' is a fun, fast paced & exciting atmospheric paranoid Horror Thriller & one that i can watch over & over again, it's just so entertaining & good fun.",8,2,4,22 December 2019
The Departed," A BRILLIANT COP THRILLER FROM A MASTER DIRECTOR.
","The Departed is one of if not the best films of legendary Director 'MARTIN SCORSESE' i know his masterpiece would probably be the Classic Taxi Driver but his edge of the seat, suspense Cop Thriller 'The Departed' is definitely in the top 5 of the best movie's Scorsese has ever made, along with the brilliant 'Cape Fear' that's another Classic suspense Thriller from the legendary Director.
This is a Masterpiece & one of the greatest movies ever made in my opinion!!!!The Departed is a gritty Cops & Criminals Thriller with a brilliant cast of some of the best actors in Hollywood!!!
Leonardo DiCaprio is TRULY outstanding here as young undercover rookie Cop Billy Costigan, leo gives one of his greatest screen performances & nails the in over his head panic of his character, you really feel for Billy as he is put in some deadly situations & is constantly on the edge of thinking he could be found out any minute & get killed, it's a fantastic role & performance from leo.
Legendary star Jack Nicholson brings his maniac charm to his role as big time gangster Frank Costello, a superb performance from Nicholson who is both funny & scary at the same time!!!
Matt Damon is great as the slimy 'Rat' who is a cop but works for Frank Costello, a good solid performance from Damon.
Mark Whailberg is excellent in his role as mouthy police sergeant Dignam, he's an intense presence & a cool character.
Legendary old school actor Martin Sheen is also excellent as Queenan, the detective working with undercover Billy & he has some incredibly intense & scary moments.
The beautiful Vera Farmiga gives a great emotional & torn performance as girlfriend of 'Rat' Sullivan (Damon) & Doctor/love interest to Billy (leo).
Legendary British tough guy actor Ray Winstone is brutally scary & gritty as Mr.French who is Costello's right hand man.
Also we have another Hollywood legend with Alec Baldwin who is the best i think I've ever seen him act as Ellerby a tough no-nonsense cop trying to bring down Costello.A fantastic cast in a brilliant instant CLASSIC, gritty,brutal,intense Cop Thriller with an Awesome cast.",10,2,4,18 August 2019
Hercules," GREAT ANIMATION,GREAT VOICE CAST & GREAT FUN
","'HERCULES' is one the most fun Disney animated films!!!
I saw this in the cinema way back in the 90's & loved it, there's a nice sense of fantasy fun & adventure with cool creatures & an amazing cast for the voice work!!!
James Woods, Danny Devito & Rip Torn to name a few all put in excellent work using their iconic sounding voices to bring iconic mythological characters to life.
'HERCULES' is good solid fantasy adventure fun with some of Hollywoods best sounding voices gracing this beautiful animated film.It's just great fun & an underrated Disney Classic.
James Woods is excellent & hilarious",8,0,0,31 December 2019
30 Days of Night," AN ACTION PACKED HORROR THRILLER THAT MADE VAMPIRES SCARY AGAIN!!!
","WOW what a fantastic & scary Horror movie this is!!!!
'30 Days of Night' deserves to be double billed with John Carpenters The Thing!!!
'30 Days of Night' is the best Vampire film ever made, it's a Horror that actually shows Vampires to be terrifying ferocious creatures & this film totally made Vampires terrifying again!!!
Also this film is a visual stylishly stunning treat with beautiful & eerie cinematography as well as a scary as hell raw icey-cold musical score that is truly haunting & very unnerving.This is also the great underrated Josh Hartnett's best movie & Role, here he gives one fine solid leading man performance!!!
As i said this Wintertime Horror made vampires absolutely terrifying again!!! like primal beasts hunting it's prey, the scariest vampires I've ever seen so far in a vampire movie...Ever!!!
The vampires look scary as hell & the bleak snowbound setting is really unsettling especially when it gets dark for 30 days of night!!!
This also has the best lead performance given by the underrated 'Josh Hartnett' who i think is a cool guy & a great lead ever since seeing him in Halloween H20 (1998), The Faculty (1998) & Black Hawk Down (2001) he was great in those movies but has also been in alot of terrible films, he is excellent here as the sheriff of this little winter town in Alaska. Here Josh plays it very serious & intense & his performance comes off completely believable as you can see the fear in his eyes!!!
Sheriff Eban is A great character for a Horror movie.
The rest of the cast are all great like 'melissa George' who is a strong tough female lead here & the always intense & creepy 'Ben Foster' who is very scary here!!!
The Atmosphere is very intense it's got that isolated 'John Carpenter' feel to it that filled his movies with dread & works perfectly here, think of two 'Carpenter' films mixed together with
'The Thing' & 'Vampires' & that's the kind of Horror this is, the atmosphere & mood is dark & creepy.
Now this may not be an absolute Masterpiece & the ending didn't play out how i would've liked but it's definitely Excellent & deserves to be a Cult Classic in the future!!!This is a blast of a brutal & violent vampire frenzy survival Horror film,
It's also a blood soaked splatter fest with real looking fake blood spilling out all the over the place like the old school Horror films we grew up watching & loving.
The setting is cold snowy & bleak, then comes nightfall & then comes the vampires & then it's full on survive the nights & fight till the end.
A scary thrill ride Horror Thriller,
Gritty,brutal,Raw & scary makes this one of the best vampire movies ever made!!! Up there with 'The Lost Boys' 'From Dusk Till Dawn' & 'Vampires'
Yes '30 Days of Night' is a superb, Thrilling & intense Horror movie with bursts of savage violence & blood splattered action!!!
A real scary blast of Horror & Action.",9,1,1,9 December 2018
Joker," AN INSTANT CLASSIC & A MASTERPIECE OF CINEMA & A FILM I CAN TOTALLY RELATE TOO!!!
","WOW!!! 'JOKER' what can be said that hasn't already?
It's an instant CLASSIC & a true masterpiece of cinema with one of the greatest performances in cinema history too from the incredible JOAQUIN PHOENIX & another great performance from the legendary Robert De Niro!!!
This movie i can relate to & i think lots of people will to, it's a powerful film & I've felt like how he feels & mental illness is an extremely hard thing to live with especially in a cold dark & nasty world like it is!!!!
A mesmerising movie!!!
The music was fantasticly moody & the cinematography was outstanding & captured the old fashioned gritty, grimy & crime infested & decaying Gotham city of 1981!!!
This Brilliant movie was part Psychological Drama & part Dark Crime Thriller, it was a mesmerising viewing & pretty much incredible in every single way!!!
I got vibes of old school greats such as Charles Bronson's 1974 Urban vigilante Thriller DEATH WISH, I also felt vibes from Martin Scorsese's 1976 Physiological Vigilante Thriller TAXI DRIVER & I'm sure there's other's that felt similar in look & story.
I felt 'Joker' really did feel like a movie made in the 70's or very early 80's as that much care was MADE in the details & grimy urban tuxture of every location, i felt dirty just watching it & that's how well crafted & expertly made this Masterpiece was.Joaquin Phoenix is Phenomenal as Arthur Fleck the struggling Comedian with an extremely sad & horrific past, he also suffers really bad with his mental health & has a condition of severe laughter when nervous or upset, it's an astonishing performance a raw piece of acting on screen that is shocking & full of realism!!!
This movie felt real & feels like it can happen & has happened & will happen as it's darkness & themes are so relevant today...now!!!
I totally enjoyed this modern masterpiece & totally agree with all the huge praise this got & the awards it won. Truly OUTSTANDING piece of filmmaking that made me feel emotional & sorry for what Arthur has gone through in his terrible life but also how he goes isn't the best way but again it's totally understandable & i bet his actions will continue debate for years!!! A stone cold gritty Classic",10,5,8,11 February 2020
Jaws," THE GREATEST FILM EVER MADE, A TIMELESS MASTERPIECE & ONE OF MY TOP 3 ALL TIME FAVES
","JAWS wow what can be said that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece?
'Jaws' was one of the first movies i ever saw as a kid that got me into proper films & not just animated stuff, well along with a few other's like 'Halloween '78' 'Ghostbusters 1&2' & probably the original 'Star wars trilogy' so yeah Jaws had a big impact on me growing up.
Jaws is the greatest summer blockbuster popcorn movie of all time, the film that truly started the big 'Summer Blockbuster' & it still holds up perfectly. No amount of today's flashy over-the-top C.G.I heavy mega budget films could ever beat Jaws on any level, the excitement & suspense & characters are a work of movie magic & art, a movie that is absolutely perfect in every single way & is still Spielberg's best movie in my opinion.All i can say is how much i love this movie to death & it's probably the main reason I'm obsessed with movies also with the Ghostbusters films as these i watched as at a very young age
But Jaws was my first experience watching a Horror film that's also part adventure & Thriller,Jaws had it all & stuck with me all my life thanks to Spielberg being a brilliant director & the outstanding beautiful music by John Williams & the BRILLIANT cast & performances & the beautiful Amity island setting.Roy scheider as Cheif Brody is one of my favourite movie characters ever, he's a fantastic average joe blue collar kinda guy & the legendary Roy scheider was never better R.I.P in my opinion & that's why Jaws 2 was also EXCELLENT because we had another film with Cheif Brody!!!
Roy scheider is immortalised as that iconic role as the panicked Cheif Brody & it's truly one of the greatest performances & characters of all time in cinema.
Richard Dreyfuss who i also love as an actor also gave a fantastic performance as marine biologist Hooper & he was just perfect & had lovely chemistry with Cheif Brody it was heartwarming especially the end when they swim back in together with thay beautiful music playing it's really a special scene that is movie magic.
Robert Shaw was excellent as the rugged no nonsense captain quint & his performance was his most iconic role of his career & so it should be he was fantastic.
Also brody's wife Ellen is also a great character & performance by Lorraine Gary she's just as important as the main three leads as she is like us the audience seeing it from the shore & terrified & in complete fear for her husband's safety when he has to leave in the boat to hunt that killer shark, she's a great actress & that's why i loved Jaws the Revenge because that was her movie her story of the effect these sharks have had on her family.Jaws is a special movie that takes a big chunk out of my heart & childhood as it's a movie I've grown with & everyone in my family loved the film especially my older brother.
Jaws is in my all time top 3 & that's a hard thing to say as i love so many movies but really Jaws had to be in there as it's so rewatchable & so beautifully made it's perfect.
Everytime i rewatch Jaws i fall in love with it all over again, it's perfect, beautiful music & performances & just simply the movie of movies.
Spielberg has never done better than Jaws in my opinion now i know he's made way more important films but none are as exciting & none have had the characters as well done as Jaws.
Jaws & it's characters will always live on & continue being some of the greatest in cinema history.SCHEIDER, DREYFUSS, SHAW & GARY are outstanding & gave some of the most memorable & beautiful performances in all of Cinema History!!! Big Nostalgia LOVE for Spielberg's Summertime Shark Horror.I love Jaws!!!!.
My all time top 3 favourite films that i grew up loving is JAWS, GHOSTBUSTERS 2 & DRAGNET.",10,0,1,17 April 2019
Hancock," AN AWESOME DIFFERENT KIND OF 'SUPER HERO'
","WILL SMITH is Fantastic yet again in another fun blockbuster movie!!! Hancock is good fun about a broken lost & lonely super hero called Hancock played perfectly by the always excellent WILL SMITH. This film has alot of laughs but more heart & drama mixed into a big budget super hero movie. Sometimes this film goes to a very deep & emotional level during some really brutal action scenes towards the end & it packs that powerful punch that SMITH does & he gives another excellent performance as Hancock. This is basically an origin story of the lost soul super hero Hancock, Yes there is a 'man of steel' vibe & there's similarities between 'superman' & Hancock but Hancock feels more real if that's possible when talking about fantasy heroes!!! & he's basically a messed up version of 'Superman' really but with more grit & darkness. It's another excellent performance from Will Smith who is my favourite actor, he does the big Action c.g.i fx action stuff but also hits all the darker & more emotional notes too, Hancock is a very troubled & complex character.Charlize Theron & Jason Bateman are also EXCELLENT & really do give fantastic performances that help lift this very dark super hero film up to a higher level.
BRILLIANTLY directed & stunningly filmed with a real gritty & grainy look something you definitely don't expect from a big blockbuster super hero film!!! But like i said before Hancock is alot of fun & has big expensive c.g.i action scenes but the underlying story is very heart breaking & serious & emotional,this movie goes to a dark place in the 2nd half & that's how i see this movie as the first half is comedy action & the 2nd half is very serious dark drama & it works perfectly.
LOVE HANCOCK",9,1,2,1 August 2018
Kong: Skull Island," AN AWESOME FUN MONSTER ADVENTURE
","'Kong: Skull Island' is a big fun Monster movie adventure, IT'S a big budget summer blockbuster film that i enjoyed alot!!!
This is the best King Kong film out there in my opinion.The ensemble cast was great with Samuel L Jackson (The Hateful Eight) Tom Hiddleston (Thor:Ragnarok)
Brie Larson (Captain Marvel)
John.C.Reilly (Step Brothers)
John Goodman (Arachnophobia) & some other's but these are the main stars & i liked Tom Huddleston playing a posh British mercenary as I've only seen him as the dark gothic evil brother of Thor in the Marvel Connected Universe films but he's good here as a smart & tough guide through the dangerous Skull Island.
Samuel L Jackson is great & intense with a serious strong performance as a troubled Captain fresh from Vietnam as this is set in 1973 just after the Americans pulled out.
I like the period setting of the 70's & it looks fantastic with excellent production design & greats visuals & fantastic cinematography as well as outstanding special fx!!!
Kong looks Amazing.This is definitely an old fashioned Jungle Adventure film with a group of explorer's & rescuers heading into the strange unknown world of Skull Island that's full of massive creatures that have been hidden from the world.
My favourite of the cast was the hilarious & touching performance from John.C.Reilly who plays a survivor from WW2 who crashed on the island & has been the ever since, he's great fun.
All in all this is great entertainment & full of Awesome monsters & battles & Soldiers fighting creatures & bits of homage to Apocalypse Now & old Explorer Adventure monster movies of the past. Great Fun.
If you like Monster Movies or Creature Features like The Meg, Congo, Jurassic Park films, Godzilla & all those types of fun films then you will definitely enjoy this film, it's the best KING KONG film ever made in my opinion.",10,3,5,31 December 2019
Centurion," A BRUTAL SURVIVAL CHASE THRILLER!!!
","Action packed & brutal as hell is how i would describe director Neil Marshall's Centurion but it's also exciting & tense & non stop!!!
Michael Fassbender is excellent as the main lead trying to get the last survivors of his roman army back home but it's gonna be a hell of a run home & the seven men are way behind enemy lines!!!
I loved the scary tense atmosphere & the bleak winter setting & the lonely cold mountains it all adds realism & grit to the chase survival story that itself is based on legend & history but with a more modern The Warriors (1979) chase twist on it & it works perfectly.
Doomsday (2008) is another EXCELLENT Neil Marshall film that's got that Warriors vibe all through it along with the tone of escape from new york,another AWESOME movie.
A great cast including Fassbender & the excellent Dominic west & a few other names but these two stood out as excellent performances!!!
The tribal hunters 'The Picks' are savage & scary & are constantly hunting our small group of men & it's suspenseful & exciting.
Another excellent & way underrated Neil Marshall movie but hey i loved it.Also i have to say im very happy that this is not another over long BORING historical epic like Braveheart or Gladiator or countless other bore fests!!! Centurion is a straight up simple survival tale with all that brutal fighting still there but with a much more urgent excitement & one hell of a chase accross all terrain!!! Excellent film that's dark & thrilling",8,3,5,17 December 2018
Halloween," A CLASSIC HORROR MASTERPIECE & MY INTRODUCTION TO HORROR
","Of course EVERYONE knows John Carpenters HALLOWEEN is an absolute CLASSIC Horror/slasher/
Thriller so no need to talk about the plot or story everyone already knows.
This was one of the first Horror movies i ever saw when i was way too young to really watch it lol but hey i loved it & watched it on t.v every time it was on at Halloween!!! Also had it on video & watched it loads but also i loved The Fog as much & remember both being played alot in my house by my mum so got know the music & atmosphere & the same with the excellent Halloween 3:season of the witch another one i grew up with & loved the creepy music & atmosphere & like The Fog it introduced me to the legend TOM ATKINS!!! love those movies.
I think the fog is a horror CLASSIC too it's just as good but both absolute CLASSIC films!!!
Halloween also introduced me to the excellent Jamie lee curtis & Donald Pleasance!!!
Yes Halloween was a great introduction to Horror & one that is so rewatchable. A nostalgic CLASSIC & still one the greatest films ever MADE.
The Halloween franchise is abit of a mess,the only good films are of course the original classic,the excellent Halloween 2 (1981),the underrated Halloween 3:season of the witch,the fun Halloween 4:The return of Michael Myers,the excellent Halloween H20 & Rob zombies Reboot & sequel are both excellent films!!! But Halloween '78 is 'THE' movie that properly introduced me to the Horror genre & i became a massive fan since & it was tradition to watch this classic on vhs every Halloween or if it was on t.v i would watch it so yeah like most fans this 70's CLASSIC means alot to alot of people & especially Horror fans.
My love for the Horror genre grew thanks to this 1978 CLASSIC & Jaws & The Fog & H3 season of the witch & Gremlins 1&2 & Ghostbusters 1&2 all these childhood greats helped shape my absolute love for Horror!!!",10,0,1,10 August 2018
Taken 2," JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST
","Neeson is back as deadly Bryan Mills in this excellent & intense Sequel to the mega surprise hit, Taken.'Taken 2' is one of those sequels that really works & is just as good as the first flick, here Bryan himself & ex-wife are Taken by the father's & family members of Bryan's victims from his Vigilante quest from the first film!!!
That's where this sequel really deserves to exist & isn't just made for 'money' here the story makes sense & has a meaning behind all the Action.I think there would be Angry other's from his victims that would want revenge on Bryan, because not only did he slaughter loads of scum but he pretty much destroyed their business of Sex-trafficking, there would be alot of blood-thirsty Criminals wanting him dead.
The story puts Bryan's Daughter from the first film into his shoes of the smart saviour, Maggie Grace is very good here as Kim & is under so much pressure to find her mum & dad before their both killed.
The story is set in Istanbul & a gang of ruthless Albanians are out for revenge.
The pacing is intense & exciting as well as keeping it's very gritty & dark atmosphere from the first film, it's also brutal & violent like we expect from a Liam Neeson action Thriller. Neeson is again serious & solid as Bryan Mills the deadly Ex-CIA Operative & does plenty of skilled fighting & shootouts, the action is slick & gritty!!!
I genuinely loved this sequel as much as i did the First film, i liked the frantic feel of the action sequences & the kick ass fights, it's also scary in the way it shows what's really going on out there all over the world & here we see the dark seedy underbelly of Istanbul, i like the slick & gritty look & the suspenseful atmosphere.'Taken 2' is a great sequel & a great Action Thriller in it's own right!!!
I loved it.",8,1,2,17 February 2020
Shrek," GREAT FANTASY FUN & THE ONLY GOOD SHREK FILM!!!
","I love 'Shrek' but only the first film as the other sequels are terrible!!!
I've watched Shrek so many times as my kids have always loved it too & we all still do, it's such a nice fun fantasy adventure comedy & still is one of the best computer animated movies of all time!!!
Comic genius Eddie Murphy is absolutely hilarious as Donkey, he steals the show & shows us again why Eddie Murphy is one of the Comedy Greats & one of the funniest actors of all time.
Shrek himself is good fun too with his Scottish accent voiced by Mike Myers & is a great character that is both strong & independent but also lost & lonely.
There's some lovely touching scenes & some Awesome action scenes like the bit where they rescue Princess Fiona from the castle & fire breathing Dragon, great Action & stunning animation.
Yes 'Shrek' is definitely one of my personal favourite animated films as it's so entertaining & so much fun & genuinely funny!!!
Also the story is good with all the recognisable Fairy tale creatures needing the help of big mean & green Ogre Shrek & end up at his swamp home, great fun & also the villain Lord Farquaad played by another comic genius John Lithgow is hilarious & so is the Gingerbread Man.SHREK is great family friendly fun & adventure",9,0,0,1 January 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT THRILLER & PURE CLASSIC
","Silence of the lambs is a stone cold 90's CLASSIC Thriller, there's outstanding performances from it's cast, Jodie Foster is absolutely Brilliant as Clarice Starling, she gives one of the GREATEST Performances in cinema history!!! Her performance is now iconic as is the equally outstanding Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, another iconic character/performance in cinema history.This old school Thriller is pure excellent entertainment, there's a terrifyingly dark & creepy atmosphere & it's a gripping edge of the seat CLASSIC movie.This is one of those films that came out when i was young growing up in the 90's & this movie was an instant CLASSIC & huge success & feels today just as glorious as it did way back then!!!
Some films are absolute stone cold CLASSIC's & silence of the lambs is definitely one of those movies.This extremely dark Detective Thriller can also be included in the Horror genre as it balances between Cop Thriller & Sinister slasher but made with so much more love.
There's a real dread filled atmosphere that's terrifying at times along with now Classic scenes & moments that are iconic to this movie now.I love the dark & dangerous feel to this film & following such a strong character like Clarice in such a sinister world of sadistic serial killers is scary & exciting, foster has created such a great character that she is so memorable & like i said, very iconic.
The rest of the solid cast round out the richness of this crime story, such as the excellent Scott Glenn & the also excellent Ted Levine, both are incredible in their roles & also give incredible performances.
The mood, music & Cinematography is all perfect.Silence of the lambs is a perfect late Saturday night type of Thriller, this is filmmaking at it's absolute best, especially within the 'THRILLER' & 'Horror' genres.",10,0,1,17 August 2019
Black Panther," A BEAUTIFUL CINEMATIC MARVEL MASTERPIECE
","Another outstanding Marvel movie & definitely one of the greatest of the lot, it's like a modern big budget Blaxploitation movie & it's fantastic!!!'Black Panther' was such an Awesome & interesting character when he popped up in the other Marvel films as a side character & here he gets his own Amazing movie.
Chadwick Boseman is excellent as Black Panther & brings his level of calm & coolness to his own fantastical adventure that plays like a super cool Spy flick adventure. Everything in this movie is a feast for the eyes as the design of the Wakanda is absolutely beautiful & visually stunning to look at!!! The production design is outstanding & the futuristic city is just amazing. Black Panther had a huge budget like all the Marvel films so it's top notch in every single department from the stunning cinematography to the Awesome & exciting music score, this is an epic super hero movie with one of the most Awesome looking & interesting Marvel characters ever!!!
The huge cast is fantastic & the action scenes are spectacular, fresh & so exciting to watch, there's some funny moments & some deep moments but most of all 'Black Panther' is an amazing fantasy adventure with Awesome fight scenes, cool gadgets & a mix of interesting characters.
I heard all good things about this movie & excellent reviews & i have enjoyed pretty much all of the Marvel films so far, well i like some more than others & Black Panther is now my favourite of the MCU.Black Panther is rich with old ancient African culture & beautiful imagery, i movie that is powerful in it's vision & in it's story.
Black Panther, is without a doubt one of the most impressive & spectacular looking movies I've ever seen.Just sit back & enter the Amazing world of the Black Panther & Wakanda for a blast of exciting action packed adventure & a big visual treat.",10,1,9,19 February 2020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," GIVES US THE GREATEST BATMAN EVER!!! A BRILLIANT,DARK & ADULT COMIC BOOK MOVIE.
","This is one hell of a dark gloomy & very serious comic book movie!!! I really enjoy this film i don't have all the ridiculous pathetic over the top fan boy hate or the over the top unnecessarily critic venom, i simply enjoyed this as a great super hero movie with the greatest batman of all time!!!
This is a mature-grown up super hero movie, there's a dark & dangerous tone to it & there's grit & violence, this is Batman in the real world.
I totally respect a more adult comic book movie & love it for doing so!!!The actual fight between Batman & Superman is excellent, couldn't have done it any better in my opinion, it's gritty & brutal & rain drenched, the fight looks fantastic!!!
The gloomy cinematography looks amazing, Zack Snyder knows how to create a dark visual mood & look, sometimes scenes are closer to the Horror genre!!! Snyder is a visionary director & the 'Nightmare' scene is excellent as is the mentioned 'fight scene' & the big battle at the end is like it's own monster movie latched on, this is a great fantasy Thriller.My ONLY big complaint would be Lex Luther!!! He was TERRIBLE. Luther aside i loved BEN AFFLECK, i loved the idea when it was first announced & his performance is the best in the movie & the best version of batman so far he's that great.
Affleck's batman is an older tougher & grittier version, he's an angry man at a corrupted world, this is the real dark knight!!!
This movie is pretty much a superhero Masterpiece, it's near on a perfectly dark fantasy Thriller with just the annoying Lex Luthor character/performance as my only real complaint or dislike in the whole movie!!!
I really appreciated the much darker feel & atmosphere of this movie, a darkness we haven't seen in a long time this well done in Comic book movie, i prefer Batman vs Superman over the 'Nolan Batman Trilogy' because here i have the best version of the Batman character to ever be filmed with Affleck's outstanding intense performance.The brutal fight scenes with Batman & thugs are BRILLIANT, exactly & finally how i want to see Batman fight!!! Everything about BATMAN is perfect. WONDER WOMAN is also fantastic in her part & SUPERMAN is Fantastic in his torn up emotional part & the big fight with Batman is AMAZING!!! the movie looks fantastic,the cinematography is OUTSTANDING & also the music is great with real emotional punch. Zack Snyder is a fantastic Director, Batman vs Superman is a fantastic film with so much good in it & so many amazing scenes like the NIGHTMARE SCENE that is AMAZING!!! watch & enjoy i did",9,5,8,31 July 2018
Blade Runner," A SCI-FI MASTERPIECE
","'BLADE RUNNER' wow where to begin? I think everything that can possibly be said about this Masterpiece of Cinema has already been written & discussed about for years & years now!!!I will just say that this is still my favourite HARRISON FORD movie & it's Director Ridley Scott's Masterpiece of Cinema, also the late great RUTGER HAUER was magnificent in his iconic role & he's cemented in the Hollywood Hall of Fame & a piece of Cinema History for his performance here!!!
The legendary Harrison Ford is also iconic & excellent here as Replicant Hunter Detective 'Deckard' & he is amazing on screen & created probably the most famous movie Detective of all time as he investigates deeper in to the dark Noir infused, smokey & rain drenched streets of the futuristic Los City, the cinematography & look of this film are unmatched by anything else in the sci-fi genre since!!! All aspects of this production are flawless, the special effects are still breathtakingly beautiful as is the truly beautiful, haunting & emotional soundtrack by Vengelis, that soundtrack album is a Masterpiece in itself!!!
The performance from Ford is fantastic as he's a tough Detective but is also clearly lost & seems to not know his place in this dark future he's in & he plays it perfectly.
I adore 'Blade Runner' & it's one of my all time favourite movies, it's still exciting every single time i rewatch this Classic.
The dark themes of a lost world & the ever changing times & our reliance on technology is always more & more relevant each day.
Blade Runner is a timeless classic.But put aside all the relevance stuff & hidden meanings, themes & messages, as this is still a great futuristic Detective Thriller with some Amazing scenes & stunning set pieces, a wonderful movie of the highest quality.
I love BladeRunner",10,1,2,5 February 2020
Trainspotting," ONE OF THE WORST FILMS EVER MADE!!!
",DEPRESSING JUNKIES IN A DEPRESSING FILM!!! what a terrible overrated Piece of crap!!! I just wanted all the VILE JUNKIES TO DIE!!! nothing else to say????? Utter garbage & i HATED EVERY CHARACTER in the film,1,6,20,31 July 2018
Space Jam," WOW!!! WHAT A LOVELY 90'S GEM
","I love 'Space Jam' & remember fondly how big this movie was back in 1996, it was a massive blockbuster hit movie & i had some of the Awesome Action figures & remember buying 'Space Jam' the day it was released to buy on home video from the Blockbuster video store, i miss that place & those days so much!!! I loved the 90's & this movie is an absolute product of that lovely time period, when the legendary Michael Jordan was a Basketball super star & to put him at the height of his superstardom in a kids animated fantasy adventure was pure genius.
Everybody has always loved the Looney Tunes characters & here Michael Jordan is brought to the tunes animated universe to help save their world from an evil group of Monsters that wanna take over, the great Danny DeVito does the excellent voice work of the evil mastermind 'Swackhammer' & his group of colourful monster/alien things magically steal some professional NBA players talents & challenge the Looney tunes to a Basketball game & the prize is if they win is to keep their world!!!
Bugs Bunny & Daffy Duff mission it to the human world & seek out the greatest player 'Michael Jordan' for help, that's the plot & it's a blast of amazing animation & hilarious antics but all feelgood family fun.'Space Jam' is a wonderful fantasy adventure that is just a joy to watch & is buzzing with energy & a sense of Fun. The music is sweet & nice & this Classic is produced by the great IVAN REITMAN, the genius who made both Ghostbusters films, Kindergarten Cop, Evolution, Twins & Junior, so this man knows great fantasy comedy.
We also gets an Awesome & hilarious little role from comic genius BILL MURRAY!!! There's also the big funny guy, Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park) & famous faces from the NBA.All in all 'Space Jam' is a Comedy CLASSIC from the 90's that i have a big soft spot for & have always loved.
Big Nostalgia Love.",8,3,4,16 February 2020
The Purge," A GREAT CONCEPT FOR A FRANCHISE & A SOLID SCI-FI THRILLER
","I love the Purge Franchise & my favourite is 'The First Purge 2018' the Blaxploitation prequel but each entry is very good in their own way.This one is the film that started it all, we have a great scary & exciting concept with a solid cast, here we get the always good & intense Ethan Hawke as the main lead as he stars as an ordinary family man getting ready to lock up for the scary night ahead.This is an intense home invasion style Thriller with an old school siege feel, it feels low-budget & very B-movie but in a great way, like the type of indie type that John Carpenter may have made in the 70's abit 'Assault on precinct 13' in it's low-key & cheap approach with it being set in one location & a it's small cast.Ethan Hawke is excellent & intense as James Sandin the dad of the house they are holed up in, we also have the excellent Lena Heady as his wife Mary & the two teens Charlie & Zoey, all well cast.
A cool standout character is the homeless bloody stranger who ends up at the Sandin's house wanting help, he's played by the good Edwin Hodge & becomes a good unlikely hero of the film.
The purge night starts & the atmosphere of dread is present & everything goes wrong when 'The Stranger' is let in to the family home, a deadly siege is commenced on the house it becomes a fight to survive the night!!!
The Purge is a very good intense survival Thriller & the excellent franchise only gets better from this fantastic first film.
Check out 'The First Purge' from 2018 for the best of the franchise in my opinion but it's a great Franchise.",7,0,0,12 December 2019
Deadpool," UTTER CRAP!!! EMBARRASSING & PATHETIC
","Overrated total stupid crap!!! Ridiculously UN-FUNNY & DEADPOOL is DEFINITELY the worst created super hero EVER!!! A joke a silly spoof of MUCH BETTER IN FACT BRILLIANT characters such as DEADSHOT played BRILLIANTLY & with heart by the legend WILL SMITH & DEATHSTROKE!!! 
DEADPOOL is boring Annoying crap & one of the worst films I've ever seen!!! My god & people hate on the BRILLIANT SUICIDE SQUAD??? absolute idiots!!!",1,3,9,5 August 2018
Jackie Brown," TARANTINO'S TRUE MASTERPIECE & ROBERT FORSTER IS OUTSTANDING!!!
","Jackie Brown is an absolutely BRILLIANT Crime Thriller, Tarantino created a gripping, intelligent, exciting, funny & totally entertaining piece of pulp cinema & my personal favourite Tarantino film, This crime Thriller is right up there with his other classic films 'Reservoir dogs' & 'Pulp fiction' the 90's were the best for Tarantino's genius.
The pairing of B-movie & low rent films of the past legends Pam Grier & Robert Forster is phenomenal, it's PERFECT casting so thank you mr. Tarantino for bringing back two of the underrated greats of past cinema, the whole movie relies on the romantic chemistry between 'Grier & Forster' & it's completely perfect.
Just the nice scenes of these two veteran actors together sitting & having Coffee & chatting are such comforting scenes, the way Max looks at Jackie when he's at her apartment & she puts on some music, beautiful touching & natural character moments, Tarantino is a genius at this, just letting you hang out with the characters & become comfortable with them like you would with real friends, Tarantino gave us a real gift with JACKIE BROWN!!!!Jackie Brown is a character piece as well as his true masterpiece, Tarantino has put interesting characters on screen & gets the viewer to hang out with them & it becomes a comfort seeing these great characters again each time you watch it & that's incredible.
From the amazing opening scene with the Awesome song playing 'Accross 110th street' it's one of the Coolest films ever made, easily the best Tarantino film in my opinion!!!
Also the look & cinematography is gorgeous this is superb film making at it's best!!!!
The dark humour is hilarious & the dialogue is witty,smart,humorous & great.
Samuel l Jackson is fantastic & gives one of his best performances!!!
Robert Forster is truly Mesmerising on screen, easily one of the greatest performances in cinema history!!!
Jackie Brown has become my favourite Tarantino movie & that's mainly due to the incredible performance from 'ROBERT FORSTER' & this movie introduced me to him & made me a fan of his & got me searching out his back catalogue of his movie career, Forster has such a great screen presence as an actor,
He is rugged world weary & full of heart but
he's got a sadness in his eyes & a rugged natural Coolness, he puts a depth into his characters, a seriousness that makes him so interesting to watch, he's truly one of the best actors in the history of Cinema in my opinion!!!
Max Cherry is one of my favourite movie characters ever, Max is the type of world weary-seen it all & survived it all kind of guy you would want as a friend, he's wise & smart & a good man.
Forster always gives a solid performance even if he has a small role in a Little B-movie, there's a richness to the veteran actor on screen that can't be matched!!!
Forster is the kind of blue collar 'working actor' who turns up in lots of movie's, mainly B-movies & low rent Thrillers but is always very good no matter what small role he may have had, he's like the great 'Tom Atkins' in that respect or even the excellent 'Robert Davi' as each guy is a good solid character actor on screen & brings their own unique acting style & screen presence & that's why these guys have huge 'cult following' later in their careers, the 'cult status' is for cool dudes like these & 'Robert forster' is easily one of the best out there!!!'Brown' is not a blood-soaked ultra violent film like 'Fiction' or 'dogs' it's a slower paced character driven drama-thriller with a beautiful heartwarming centre, that centre is the two ageing & lonely unlikely kind of couple in 'Jackie Brown' & 'Max Cherry', it's the heart of this crime caper.Jackie Brown has definitely become a favourite of mine now (It's entered my all time top 20 films list) 'Brown' grew on me the most as i used to like it & always loved pam & forster in it but i used to think this was Tarantino's most boring film, but hey i was only a teen then so i couldn't understand the richness of the characters & the excellent story telling until i was older & now it's my favourite of his movies!!!
I rediscovered the genius of 'Jackie Brown' & fell in love with it.The heart of this gripping crime Thriller is the sweet unsaid love story of Jackie Brown & Max Cherry, it unfolds beautifully & never fully blossoms but it's there.The cast & performances are truly fantastic here in Jackie Brown, i mean we have the legendary Pam Grier, Robert De niro, Samuel l Jackson, Bridget Fonder, Michael Keaton & Robert forster!!!
This is a standout ensemble cast & Pam & forster give the greatest performances of both their careers!!!Max Cherry (Forster) is my favourite character from the universe of Tarantino, i think 'roberts' performance is one of the greatest in cinema history & he got a nomination!!!
I'm thankful for 'Tarantino' introducing Robert forster & Pam Grier to me with this film, this film also resurrected Forsters career & got him the attention he deserves as a respected veteran actor.
Pam Grier is TRULY outstanding as 'Jackie Brown' she gives the film a higher feel of quality & her BRILLIANT performance is mesmerising, she made an incredible lead along with 'Forster' & it's the best I've ever seen her.The music is beautiful throughout & the scenes are crafted with a special song thats specific to that moment, it's Tarantino's genius again at work.
Jacke Brown is a fantastic movie & is as good as pulp fiction & reservoir dogs & that's how great a filmmaker Tarantino is!!!
Tarantino is one of the greatest directors of all time.
Reservoir dogs 10/10
Pulp fiction 10/10
Jackie Brown 10/10
His 90's films are still the best, big Nostalgia for Tarantino & the 90s.
So sad to hear about the passing of one of my favourite actors ever 'Robert Forster' R.I.P to one of the greats, an actor so full of passion & heart, the type of 'Real' working man actor we don't see anymore, i will continue to see him everytime i watch his OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE as Max Cherry in 'Jackie Brown'",10,2,2,22 August 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT & TOM HARDY IS AWESOME
","I grew up watching & loving the 'Mad Max Trilogy' & Mel Gibson was always fantastic as the tough wasteland warrior & now I'm very happy to say that our new wasteland hero is the fantastic actor 'Tom Hardy' the guy is one of the best actors out there today!!! He's the biggest actor of his generation & he's a hell of a presence on screen. I've only recently got into Tom Hardy films as he hasn't done much that i wanted to see or be interested in seeing except his excellent role of 'Bane' in the 3rd part of Nolan's Batman Trilogy 'The Dark Knight Rises' & that was it for ages until he did the Marvel film 'Venom' which i absolutely loved & consider it easily one of the best 'Marvel' films & one of the best comic-book films, then i saw his 'Mad Max' & he was excellent in the role of our hero of the dangerous wasteland.'FURY ROAD' is a full throttle action packed adventure through the ever dangerous Apocalyptic wastelands & the original Director George Miller is back with his new Masterpiece.
The excellent Charlize Theron is great here too but this is Hardy's Mad Max he's as good as Mel Gibson if not better in some ways!!!
The cinematography is gorgeous as expected & the scarily violent warrior & gang filled world of Mad Max is much more explored in this movie,
The music is banging Awesome throughout & the action is tough, brutal & Awesome!!! It's one hell of furious road trip accross dangerous territory & Mad finds some people to help & begins a violent quest of dazzling action set pieces.
There's too many crazy-funny & just plain Awesome bits in this instant CLASSIC.
Tom Hardy has stunned me again recently with his intense performance in Christopher Nolan's New WW2 survival MASTERPIECE 'Dunkirk' he just keeps getting better as an actor.Anyway Mad Max:Fury Road is fantastic fast & furious fun.",10,1,4,10 January 2020
The Pursuit of Happyness," A BEAUTIFUL DRAMA & WILL SMITH IS MY FAVE ACTOR
","Another outstanding performance by the BRILLIANT Will Smith!!! 
WILL SMITH is truly become one of the greatest actors of all time,just like his outstanding performance in Ali & Seven pounds he crafts such an emotional punch into his characters that you totally feel an emotional attachment to his roles,he's a genius!!! 
This is a powerful drama based on a powerful & uplifting true story a real rags to riches tale.
I won't go into the story as you would've heard all about it by now.If like me you are a huge Will Smith fan then you will really love this beautiful film i mean it's not a movie i would watch loads as it's abit too dramatic & emotional to put on alot my usual go to Smith movies are I,ROBOT,HANCOCK & MEN IN BLACK FILMS but i love all his films & have collected them all except Focus that was terrible & his worst film!!! Pursuit of Happyness is a great movie with an Oscar nomination for will's outstanding performance!!!",10,0,0,8 September 2018
Shark Tale," VERY FUN & FEELGOOD BECAUSE 'WILL SMITH' IS AWESOME!!!
","I love this silly,fun & colourful little animated movie 'Shark Tale' i know this isn't very popular compared to other animated movies but i love it's fun atmosphere & down to the always great 'Will Smith' who brings all his old school 'Fresh Prince' charm,energy & humour to the part of 'Oscar' a silly little fish who can't stop getting into trouble & is always trying to get rich until he gets in too deep with some gangsters sharks, played hilariously by legend 'Robert De Niro' & comedy great 'Jack Black', black is a timid non-violent non-meat eating shark who gets mixed-up with & become friends with 'Oscar', also legendary movie director 'Martin Scorsese' does some fun voice work & the whole movie has a very lively & colourful feelgood vibe, there's great bouncy music & lots of silly comic bits that make this adventure a nice watch.I've been a huge fan of 'Will Smith' since i was little & grew up watching 'Fresh Prince of bel' & all his movies, he's been my idol since i was little & I've always loved his music too 'Big Willie Style' is my all time favourite album, he's my childhood Hero & my favourite actor so i love watching his movies & this animated flick is a good one because he's basically a fish version of the fresh Prince lol it's good family fun.",6,0,0,25 September 2019
Beetlejuice," TIM BURTON'S BEST MOVIE & A NOSTALGIC CHILDHOOD CLASSIC
","Beetlejuice is Tim Burton's best movie in my opinion, it's a funny-crazy & totally inventive supernatural comedy,
This is one of those 80's CLASSIC's i grew up on along with the likes of Ghostbusters 1&2 & Death Becomes Her, among others, these were fun, spooky comedies full of fantastic special effects that were great for it's time well before c.g.i completely took over & the fx back then actually were special!!!
Tim Burton crafted a beautifully designed fantasy Horror comedy, the visual look is fantastic with it's big gothic cartoony style & colourful sets & incredible creature designs, this is Burton at his creative best in my opinion!!!
The atmosphere is nightmare weird & cartoony strange but not in a threatening way, it's more a fun fantasy feel to the film with many creative bits popping out at you.
The cast is great fun & so memorable.
Especially BeetleJuice himself!!!
Michael Keaton is excellent in his most iconic role as the crazy-menacing & hilarious evil spirit 'BeetleJuice' his performance is legendary now & he's full of life for a dead guy lol, he's great fun.BeetleJuice is a pure 80's CLASSIC movie, i grew up loving this on video & also collected all the Awesome action figures from the movie, great nostalgia for this fun, gothic Horror-comedy.
This is Director Tim Burton at his absolute best in my opinion!!!
The big haunted house is a beautiful set peice & the production design of the supernatural otherworldly sets are incredible!!!
Also the music is BEAUTIFUL, especially the opening scenes it's just beautifully done.
This film makes me long for that lovely lost era of the 80's & early 90's my favourite times as i grew up in those simpler times with these CLASSIC movies.
There's some absolute classic scenes in this film such as the waiting room scene full of freaky spirits & the big scary BeetleJuice snake scene, superb moments in a a superb movie.
This is one my favourite movies of all time from Childhood & it gets better with age!!!",10,1,1,21 August 2019
