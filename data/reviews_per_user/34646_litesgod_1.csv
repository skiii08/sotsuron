Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Incredible, just as good as the other three.
","This movie, and this series truly is critic proof.  The problem is, the critics all want Lucas to use his platform to say some deep message about the world today.  However, Lucas just wants to make a great movie.  And that he did.  Criticism has ranged from a poor performance by Jake Loyd to the digitally created Jar Jar Binks being annoying and comical.I'm going to try to keep this from having any spoiler material, and still try to counter some of the critics.  Jake Loyd does a stellar job.  His job was not Academy Award caliber, but how much can you ask from a child?  Not only is he stepping into the role of the most recognized evil villian in the world, he is supposed to portray the heartless Darth Vader before he knew anything about hate or greed. Jar Jar is, at times, cartoonish, but hardly annoying.  His accent takes sometime to get used to, but he is far from being impossible to understand. He takes a role of comic relief, a role provided in the original movies by C3P0. The effects are dazzling, precisely what one would expect from Lucas and ILM.  If you had any doubts about going to see this movie, get over them, and five it a chance.  You will not be disapointed.",10,1,1,20 May 1999
