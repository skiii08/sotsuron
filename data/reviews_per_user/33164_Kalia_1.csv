","Alright, now let me just say first that this is an excellent movie!! I'm a huge Disney fan, but I really don't think that I've seen this good a movie from them in a long time. The animation is superb, excellent to say the least, and the characters are believable.Unlike Disney films, this movie is realistic. We don't have a sporty, handsome, sure-of-themselves hero type, nor the fair damsel in distress that falls for him. The secondary characters don't take away the spotlight (Pocahontas, anyone?), plus the villains here aren't bumbling idiots that reveal their plans to everyone in the first half hour of the film like so many Disney-esque chars. seem to do quite often.Once and for all, the dialogue is pretty good too. I remember sitting in the row, and when one of the characters swore, a mother behind me began talking about how this wasn't suitable for her eleven-year-old child. What are you bitching about? Yes, you heard me! I've gone to the elementary school and hear kids in like grade two swear up a streak! It seems that the only people concerned with the language in this film are the over-protective parents. Alright, I'm 15, so I haven't lost the touch that kids have, and I have a word for you parents: Your kids do use those words... not when you're there of course, but they do.As well, the fight scene and others of violence were believable too. It was true... in Disney films, someone can get beat up, stabbed or even shot with an arrow, and do you see any blood? No, of course not. Well, the war scene in this had an eerie quality that actually made it look real. Everyone was on the edge of their seats that time.Perhaps if people paid attention to the facts that the characters were good, the story plot was pretty well laid out and the animation was absolutely brilliant, instead of remembering the swearing and the fact that it wasn't Disney, then they would get the full impact of the show.It was realistic, it was human... that's all that matters",Null,0,0,18 October 1998
