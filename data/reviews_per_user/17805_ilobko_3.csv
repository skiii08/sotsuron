The Ring," Poor people
","The whole idea of making american remakes of good asian and european movies should not be tolerated. It`s like explaining something to a dumb and lazy person. If i were you i would never let people tell me what to do and what to watch. I would rather choose it myself. I chose RINGU, not The Ring. For those of you who never heard about RINGU - its a japaneese movie, copied and recycled in THE RING.",Null,0,1,5 November 2002
Spider-Man," Not enough Raimi
","Yesterday saw Spiderman movie and it left me very dissapointed.Sam Raimi was always my favourite director, but this movie is way too american for european tastes - parents of Spidey are dying desperately, tears are falling from their faces like rain from the sky, where american flag is waving. I know, i know, its good to be a patriot, to love your family, but why show it in an action movie in such a hard dose. There were some nice moments (famous camerawork included), but the whole thing is not gaining even Darkman's (old Raimi's work)level of quality. So watch Sam's previous movies instead of this one. Evil Dead is a first to watch!",8,0,0,7 May 2002
Mission: Impossible II," Boring!
","This movie is a total mess and a big disappointment to watch. I heard a lot of good stuff about the first one and was desperate to watch the sequel. I also enjoyed some previous Woo works, so the expectations were high, but the movie was SO BORING that i couldn't wait till the end. Plot? No plot AT ALL. It's even sillier than the recent James Bond. Don't waste your money and time! Wait till it comes out on video. 2 out of 10 for short length.",1,1,2,4 August 2000
