The Avengers," Greatest Superhero movie ever made. Simple as.
","Quite truly, this is a film that makes your mouth water while watching it. The man and the character that steals the film is Hulk played Mark Ruffalo. He adds this unique stint to the character commonly known to be scary ruthless monster. He actually has the best comedy 'bits' in the whole film. We all thought Iron man/Tony Stark would provide the humour in the film, he does, but I feel he was casted down to be more of a super hero. You will understand what I mean when you watch it. This brings me to the point, would the Iron Man and Avengers movie franchise be any good without Robert Dwoney Jr. He is truly an incredible actor, that is so suited to the character of Tony Stark. I don't wanna say anymore, and I am so damn tempted to give away a couple of spoilers, but I have to resist to let you enjoy this fabulous movie. GO WATCH IT.",10,2,7,28 April 2012
