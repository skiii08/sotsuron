Scarface," Good Gangster Movie, but ONE problem ....
","I realize, there is nothing more to say about this movie, as all has been said in the many comments here, except : The cheesy 80's music, which seems to be created with the cheapest synthesizers of that time, destroys many of the atmosphere a gangster movie should have. i mean, when they are in the club, did people REALLY dance to that creepy stuff, they're playing there ? this could have been a timeless movie, if the director would've used a classical score, that's for sure. i guess that maybe in 1983 this was the hippest you could get, but that's definitely way beyond hip now. they should release some sort of director's cut with a reworked soundtrack.",7,0,1,7 January 2005
