Hereditary," Scary? No Thriller? Nope!! Enjoyable? Perhaps as a sedative!!
","How is this movie getting such rave reviews?!
I found myself falling asleep while undertaking this harrowing journey from opening scene to closing credits.Nothing even REMOTELY scary occurred in this film.At many 'scary moments' I could hear snickers, giggles, and laughter throughout the auditorium, other than my own.Which is undoubtably a shame, as I was interested to see Gabriel Byrne and Toni Collette in this 'highly touted, chilling masterpiece'. Toni Collette really shines in this train wreck, as she slowly trickles into madness. Gabriel Byrne does his best as the concerned father and husband.Sadly, those are really the only 'good things' I could say about this film. I don't consider myself an expert in film, nor do I think I am a renowned reviewer. In actual fact, I do believe this is the first review I have EVER written. I felt compelled to write at least 1 review that might shed some light on this 127 minutes snooze fest!!To coin a phrase from Blackadder, 'I was more frightened by the contents of my handkerchief the last time I blew my nose!!'",1,14,34,12 June 2018
