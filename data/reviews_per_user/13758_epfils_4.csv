Mission: Impossible III," Surprisingly superb
","Mi-III is an explosive entertainer that is far better than the crappy Mi-II. After seeing the latter, one does not really expect much especially after the idiotic motorcycle fight scenes, boring and draggy plot and sequences and pathetic attempts at add complexity to the plot. Mi-III differs greatly in that it leaves out the totally unnecessary complexities and twists in plot, at least not to the extent of the past two movies. The story is good, the actions scenes are good and the acting is very good as well. Although the movie starts off a bit boring, it progressively gets better and better. All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable movie which is highly recommended.",9,0,1,8 July 2006
Madagascar," Over-hyped and retarded
","This one computer animated movie that is completely the opposite of the what the hype tells you. It is clich√©d and retarded and most of the time, NOT FUNNY. It also uses several racial stereotypes and toilet humor. First of all, for a kids movie and being strictly marketed as such, how could the Zebra say 'Mothaf....' and how could the Giraffe present a rectal thermometer to his friend to put in his mouth? Its obviously not just a coincidence that the Zebra is also made to explicitly talk and act like an African American for the same reason. That is too much of racial stereotyping. There are very few genuinely funny moments in this movie and too many stupid moments. Overall, this movie is a less than average piece of crap that ran out of ideas before it even began.",2,5,8,8 July 2006
Independence Day," Underrated
","This movie gets bashed a lot and its surprising to see so many idiots pretend to be pseudo intellectuals who can't enjoy 2-3 hrs of pure unadultrated fun. Sure it isn't the most sophisticated movie ever made but it was mostly very well done and was highly entertaining and polished for what it was worth. The special effects were top notch and the dogfight sequences were great fun even if a bit unrealistic in the actual manuevering capabilties of the aircraft involved. But its not too often that you get to see so many stealth B-2s in the air. If you have'nt seen this, then this movie is recommended as a great entertainer and feel good movie. The characters weren't very deep but were likable.",8,2,5,8 July 2006
Gladiator," Spectacular
","A movie like Gladiator is extremely rare and the concept involved does raise some question marks. However, the movie is so well made and so brilliant that it makes this one of the greatest movies ever made in history. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is absolutely amazing and brilliant and I'm surprised that he gets little mention and is often overshadowed by Russel Crowe. Joaquin Phoenix is certainly one of the most underrated actors of all time. The special effects are brilliant and the gore depicted so realistically that the violent is impactful yet not disturbing. The only minor nitpick about this epic is how Commodus is so easily hated by all and maximus gets so much support and backing so easily.",10,1,2,8 July 2006
