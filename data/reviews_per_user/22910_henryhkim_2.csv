Hereditary," Terrible movie, plot is not recognizable
","Terrible movie, plot is unrecognized. Mother acts well but story line make zero sense. Ending has no basis. Such waste of money.",1,19,44,10 June 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," too convoluted of a plot
",Too convoluted of a plot. Too long to show the fight between the 2 heroes. How can superman not immediately destroy batman (human) in 5 seconds ?The plot does not get explained well enough in first hour of movie. The portion of fighting the monster is too long portion of movie.There was no explanation of how the special bullet enters the movie. Lex character is not played well at all; why does he act like Joker?Too much time spent on the woman super hero and how she came to be found out. I found the Clark character not believable in terms of relating to Lois. The Bruce character is not portrayed in the way I remember from other movies.,6,3,7,1 April 2016
