Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Different, but not worse
","Seeing Kill Bill Vol. 2 before it opened, as a special screening was cool, however, I was expecting Volume One's crazy bloody fights and outrageous-ness.  And I thought it was a bit misleading of Michael Madsen to tell Maxim magazine that 'You ain't seen nothin' yet.'  In actuality, all of that crazy in your face hoopla wasn't consistently blowing up in blood in front of your face.  However...this movie shows some of Quentin's great talent for dialogue.  And he ties it all together in this film.  And! There is an excellent segment for those who dig old skool Kung Fu movies. Bottom line is -- if you don't want to walk out disappointed in any way --: don't create expectations based on Kill Bill: Vol. 1",Null,0,1,15 April 2004
