The Ring," Scariest movie ever made! Go see it.
","The Ring was a pure delight, and quite possibly the scariest filmI've ever seen before.  I was totally gripped to my theatre seat forthe entire film, squirming and looking away at stages trying to pickwhere the next scare would come from.I've seen plenty of horror films in my time, but nothing like TheRing.  It's just such a great idea.  The film wonderfully holds yourfull attention throughout and takes you on a truly 'eerie' journey dueto some great acting, beautiful cinematography and awesomeeffects from Rick Baker.I can't believe some people are criticising some sections of theplot and even the ending (how could they possibly complain aboutthe ending, the best ending to a horror film EVER!  I had shiversrunning up and down my spine).  Some reviewers taking it tooseriously and are missing what The Ring is about, it's not meantto be Schindlers List....it's a horror film and what it sets out to do ....it does perfectly.You must not miss The Ring, ignore some of the minor negativereviews, focus on all the positive ones.  And do yourself a favourwhen it comes out on DVD, pick a really rainy friday night and driveto your local video store and rent it out.   Take it home and watch itwith all the lights out in your house, you'll thank me in the end. Enjoy!",10,0,0,20 December 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Terminator ended at T2 - Avoid at all costs
","Don't be trapped into seeing this poor cousin to the Terminator series.  Why has it taken so long to produce such a poor followup?  The acting is bad, the Termanatrix does nothing special but throw some sparks out of her hand, some of the Terminators look like something from Short Circuit and the ending is a real let down.  I think the whole audience walked out thinking nothing was gained by making T3, the story hasn't progressed ...in fact most of it seemed like it was telling T2 all over again.  The Matrix series is the leader now, Revolutions will ROCK!",Null,0,0,15 August 2003
Vanilla Sky," Most amazing and frustrating film of all time
","I won't go into exhausting detail about the film, you can read other peoples comments for that.  But what I will say is the film was pure genious, except for the 'easy way out' and incredibly disappointing sci-fi ending.  The film had built itself up so well over more than an hour and a half and then discovered it had no where to go.  And then over explained itself in an otherwise mysterious and unique film.But with that aside I loved the film, it was annoying and even made me get a headache (well I was close to the screen too), but the acting was superb from all involved....and Cameron has created a film here that will be talked about for years to come.  The scenes of Times Square completely silent were awesome and were worth the price of admission alone, not to mention the outstanding soundtack that always accompanies Cameron's films.Go and see it for yourself, everyone will have a different opinion about it, so go and make yours.  But no matter what your final verdict might be, you will be taken on a visual rollercoaster that even the harshest of critics couldn't deny experiencing.It is an emotion packed and enjoyable experience that takes you out of the cinema and places you in the film.Out of 10 I rate it 8 and a half, points lost for it's ending.  You will have seen the ending before in 'Total Recall'.",Null,0,0,21 December 2001
