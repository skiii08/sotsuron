The Ring," An outstanding film.
","I had been waiting for so long for this film. When I found out my local cinema was screening a preveiw I was first in line. I was a little worried that I had hyped this film to myself to much........I was not disappointed. This was without doubt one the most polished films I have ever watched. I was gripped from start to end. The direction was outstanding, the storyline was first rate and the acting was of a much higher standard than this genre usually receives. I cannot recommend this film too much. It was awesome. I have never been this scared since the Blair Witch. Go see it.........class.",10,0,0,17 February 2003
