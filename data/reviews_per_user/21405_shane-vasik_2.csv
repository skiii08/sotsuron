Iron Man 3," One of the worst movies I have ever watched....and I'm an action/comic fan!
","Okay, I don't want to overstate things here, so I'll just casually say that this is well and truly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long, long time.Where do I start? I can go on and on about how boring, stupid, repetitive, predictable, typical and unbelievable in the worst possible way this movie is. Despite the fact that it goes without saying the movie is based on a fantasy comic book superhero, this pushes the boundaries of idiocy and juvenile.So, rather than write a 15 page diatribe on what is so poor about this waste of 2 hours, I thought it best to summarise these flaws in point form.* Three missile-shooting helicopters are powerful enough to blow up a heavily fortified house, destroy several 'better model' Iron Man suits, a dozen armour-plated vehicles and an entire Cliffside...yet his unsuccessful, aluminium-plated prototype survives - no, thrives even, saving everyone's life all on it's own as though the 'suit' is it's own sentient being. * terrorists use heavily armoured helicopters, but they are obviously no match for a wooden piano flying through a triple-plated glass wall and, without deviation to its trajectory, 50 metres in a straight line through the air. * a 12 year old kid from Tennessee sounds like he's from upstate New York, is smarter than most college graduates, and talks/behaves like an adult. Seriously, why do action movies have kids in them to add a bit of 'Ying to his Yang' only to make the kid a small version of an adult? * where did all those Iron Man suits come from? Suddenly he doesn't have a few - he's got 600 of them, and each of them can fly on their own, plan tactics, rescue people and attack the bad guys (that is, after they've identified who they are...all on their own). * how many explosions does Pepper survive? A cut on the cheek? Yep, that's enough to convince me she was 'lucky' the entire building collapsed around her and not on her. * I still don't understand...what is the bad guy's problem? So he got stood up on a rooftop - that's enough to be an international terrorist? * Slow motion does not mean everything else slows down except for the main character...who can suddenly move in real time. That's another superhero altogether. * Why does Stark need his suit anyway? Without it, he's like the Hit-man and Solid Snake combined - dodging bullets, throwing bombs, kicking ass and being heroic all whilst being suave and cool and sexy. * Guy Pearce's performance was okay, but wasted on this piece of trash. Sir Ben Kingsley shows why he was knighted just for being the amazing actor he is, but this movie is well beneath his talents. Don Cheadle is a good actor who, unfortunately, seems to like picking crap roles. And Downey Jnr. is, well, the same in this movie as he has been in every single movie he's done since coming back from constant rehab and cocaine and rehab sessions. * and I thought they overdid the acrobatics with Legolas - it seems that Stark can never fall, get injured or be left alone with his nemesis without some sudden appearance from his 'suits'. * super Pepper takes down the Iron Man suit in one punch - despite a barrage of super-super fire-breathing henchmen unable to make a friggin dent. I cannot believe that I wasted 2 hours of my existence watching this garbage. I've never seen anything worse in the 36 years I've been alive, and I doubt I will in the coming 36 years. And this is coming from a man who loves action movies, generally doesn't mind comic book adaptations, and is ever hopeful that the wider movie watching public will one day appreciate them more than simply those who are fans. But, in saying all that, these disappointments provide more than enough evidence to prove why, maybe, they are made too often lately. Let's hope this was the last movie with Downey Jnr., and Iron Man, and that Gwyneth Paltrow can get a real job...say, flipping burgers at McDonald's.",1,2,5,13 January 2015
Star Trek," I'm sorry, but I still don't like this film all that much..
","Firstly, it doesn't 'feel' like Star Trek. Okay, okay, you've heard that before from other reviewers, but here's why it's important to some of us: Simply calling a sci-fi action flick 'Star Trek' doesn't make it fitting of the universe it is built around. The ship in this movie reminded me of The Minority Report for some reason - all white with light blue displays had an intergalactic hospital feel about it. Spock making sarcastically predictable one-liners were so bad I gagged whilst others chuckled. And Kirk being a martial arts expert with a teenage angst attitude who never listens to the advice of his officers (even though he repeatedly asks for it) makes no sense whatsoever.Also, although I like Eric Bana, what's with a Romulan covered head to toe in tattoos? I never knew they inked up before. And, to this day, I still have no idea why he's so upset with Earth.This did not feel like a movie about a Starfleet captain or crew in the 23rd century, at a time when we've evolved beyond our petty differences and practically created utopia on Earth. This felt like...well, just another sci-fi action flick, and a poor one at that. I actually liked all the TNG movies (yes, even Insurrection and especially Nemesis), but this left a bad taste in my mouth.",3,2,4,16 January 2015
