Casablanca," Play it again, Sam!.
","A re-watchable or 'Play it again, Sam' chestnut of the 'what would happen if...' variety which also happens to be good theatre and an artefact of its era. It's informative and 'draws back the curtain' on an event that has become history. Its 'slant' is propaganda but then, even in today's society, what isn't? It's a well structured screenplay worthy of study. It possesses quotable and re-quotable lines. Relax, sit comfortably, and enjoy being entertained!",10,0,0,30 December 2001
