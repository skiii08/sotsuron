Hereditary," Don't read and believe the reviwes!
","One of the best horror movies? I'm still scared? I can't watch for a few days after watching it? ROFL
Who's wrote these comedy comments? 7yo girls? Just for real horror fans: this movie is not scary, it's no horror and it's pathetic in evert way. Do not wadte your time and money on such stupidity.",3,1,3,29 October 2018

","If potatoes could feel, they'd cried over this movie. If tomatoes could speak, they'd shouted over this movie. If all men had a brain, they'd never ever watched such wasteful garbage. I deeply feel as I'm being fooled by a bunch of bad made CGI and an actress, who most probably got this role, because she is nice and sexy, but possesses in no way, any kind of acting abilities. Basically, all she does all the movie is to pose in front of camera with shoulders wide, getting into jump mode with one knee bent etc etc. I mean, do men don't see enough beautiful women nowadays, so even the movie actresses must be beautiful and sexy to attract people to the theaters? Beside that, the only positive thing about this movie is Chris Pine. Without him, I'd stood up and left the theater. Expect to watch absolutely no character built up, no worthy dialogues, no real fights, even if it is a fantasy film, it all makes no sense at all. Two villains who come out of nowhere with no real background or any story behind. They suddenly get killed like they're not important at all. I mean, come on, give us something to enjoy. I'd watch Baywatch, if it's all about seeing a sexy woman acting like a super hero!",1,3,9,1 December 2017
