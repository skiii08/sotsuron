The Devil's Advocate," One of Favourite Movies
","Kevin Lomax (Reeves), a hot shot lawyer who's never lost a case. A master at getting the guilty acquitted, despite his belief in their guilt.Mary Ann Lomax (Theron), Kevin's wife who dreams of a family and languishes in her husbands success.And of course John Milton (Pacino), the head of the most powerful law firm in the world.Milton recruits Lomax to his law firm and rewards him with the mega wages and the standard of life he and his wife have been longing for. An instant success Lomax becomes the hot property of the legal world, while Mary Ann continues to only dream of the family she so desires. Ill at ease and suspicious of everyone and everything, she begins her decent into madness, while Kevin continues to dominate the courtroom, with the aid of the brilliantly manipulative Milton. As the story unfolds, Kevin becomes seduced by the power Milton affords him, and Mary Ann becomes increasingly insane; or so it appears.In a truly fantastic climatic sequence, Lomax learns the truth about himself and his family, and he tries one final shot at redemption (an attempt to spit in the Devils Face) that doesn't quite work out as he had hoped.The secret to the appeal of this movie is the subtle visuals that project you into Mary Ann's state of mind, the seductive and manipulative methods used by the superbly cast John Milton, and the climax that is revolutionary to say the least.An absolute masterpiece 10/10",10,28,33,19 January 2005
The Mask," A Fine comedy treat
","Carrey is on top mad-cap form in the Mask, he plays Stanley Ipkiss, a boring Mr. nice guy with a longing for more excitement and success in his life. When he finds a relic of an ancient mask, he gets slightly more than he could have dreamt of; he becomes a cartoonish superhero and at last he can live out his desires; or not! This film also introduced the very beautiful Cameron Diaz, and what man can forget her first screen appearance as she breezes in to the bank in all her splendour.Hilariously funny, cracking special effects and a thoroughly entertaining story, the Mask is a winner people, and it's an absolute must-see for everyone who likes a bit of Jim Carrey madness.7/10",7,58,65,22 January 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Vol 2, More Character, Less Action but equally as good
","Where the first film grabbed our attention, with its visuals, action and a special brand of Tarantino violence. Volume 2 takes you back through the characters and fills in the background to the story and the rivalry between the them.Equally as good as the first (an opinion not shared by everyone) this film is closer to Tarantino's usual style where the story and dialogue carry the film more than the action and the violence. There are still ample thrills and some good fights, but i have to say its the revelations in the plot and the ending that do it for me. Very clever and subtle, and really very funny (in a strange way) this was the perfect end to Tarantino's latest masterpiece.10/10",10,5,10,23 January 2005
Alien 3," Another Fine Film
","I remember seeing this film and thinking that it was trying to re-create the first film, unsuccessfully. My opinion has changed after viewing it again and although it is neither as fresh as Alien or as exciting as Aliens it still is a fine film. Credit has to go to David Fincher for even attempting this sequel. I think if this had been the second in the series it would have failed. Fincher quite brilliantly recreates some of the tension of the original and manages to work in some great characters.I think that after Aliens, we all know exactly how deadly these creatures are, and to throw one in with a bunch of convicts with no weapons (except Ripley) works surprising well.Overall the movie delivers the terror and suspense, which when added to the shocking ending, makes for entertaining viewing yet again 8/10",8,4,6,15 January 2005
Gremlins," Infectiously funny
","Zach Galligan plays Billy a young bank clerk, when his father (Hoyt Axton) brings him a some what unusual Christmas gift, a creature known as a mogwai which they name Gismo; his life changes dramatically. After a series of accidents Gismo multiply's and the cute furry offspring soon become little green beasts that terrorise the town, leaving Billy and his girlfriend (Phoebe Cates) to find a way to get rid of these gremlins, before everyone winds up dead.Gremlins is infectiously funny and effortlessly entertaining with its blend of cutsie charm and comic book horror. The creatures themselves are excellently brought to life with some masterful puppetry and Joe Dante's direction really does the film justice.This movie is crammed with memorable scenes, subtle parody and excellent, yet quite humorous horror.7/10",7,8,15,9 January 2007
Antz," Dreamworks answer to 'A Bug's Life'
","Released 1 year after Disney/Pixar's 'A Bugs Life' and still during the early years of the computer generated genre, Dreamworks released their second all CGI cartoon 'ANTZ' and despite the glaring resemblances between the 2 movies; all it not as it appears.ANTZ still stands alone as the more adult movie in the genre, far more complexity in the character's emotions and a far more sinister plot evolution separate this from rest. OK movies like 'Shrek', 'Finding Nemo' and 'Toy Story' have adult undertones beneath the humour, but ANTZ doesn't rely on such subtlety.PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT A CRITICISM OF EITHER STYLE! We follow the struggle of 'Z' (Woody Allen) as he tries to come to terms with his life as a worker, his neurosis, his love for Princess Bala and dream of something better. Allen is excellently supported by an all star cast, including Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman, Christopher Walken, etc, and we are treated to a visually impressive rendition of a heart warming story about life as an ANT.This movie can still be enjoyed as a family film, but much of it will be lost on younger kids.In Summary ANTZ is a fine film, but in truth it is difficult to compare with others in the genre, and for that; i salute it! 7/10",7,16,26,11 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 16 years later, and we finally get to see the beginning of the Saga
","The problems George Lucas had, when he began to piece together the prequel trilogy to the Epic Star Wars Saga are as follows - 1/ He's tied into a story that all the original fans already know, leaving him less scope for his ideas than he had before.2/ He made such a fine job of the original movies, the fans will expect more of the same.3/ He has to appeal to a new generation of Star Wars fans, and without the Impact of Groundbreaking special effects, its harder this time round. (Face it, Great special effects are seen in adverts these days)So, evidently we end up with an inferior movie, but thankfully it's still a good one. Lucas has still managed to bring in some new characters, he has created some memorable scenes (the Pod Race scene is superb) and above all he's begun to fill in some background to the characters we Star Wars fans know and love, R2, C3PO, Obi-Wan and Yoda. I believe more time could have spent on some of the new characters build up, but he only has 3 films to reach the point where Star Wars started off, and there is a lot of story to cover.There are some flaws in the film, but there is enough here to entertain you, and George is just warming up.One thing i was massively impressed with, and strangely it was the movies biggest let down at the same time, Darth Maul and his truly brilliant light-sabre battle with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon. The question is why not have more of him in the movie? But who am i to question George Lucas's motives.8/10 Nice Effort, on a difficult first outing.",8,26,40,3 February 2005
Catch Me If You Can," Hard to believe its true
","I Don't know how accurate these events are but as they are based on accounts written by Frank Abagale Jr. himself, then i assume that they are probably only dramatised for the viewing audience.It's hard to believe that people were so naive, that they allowed Frank Abagnale to achieve what he did, but i have give the guy credit for pushing the system, and riding the high life for as long as he did.Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job of capturing the character of Frank Abignale Jr. (strange i didn't picture him in the role of a jet setting Gigalo) and the rest of the cast although only little more than fringe characters, are all very well cast and give typically fine performances, as you would expect with the calibre of Hanks and Walken.All in all this is a fine film, that most people will enjoy watching 8/10",8,54,60,17 January 2005
Ghost," This film delivers time and time again
","Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is murdered, just as he and his sweetheart, Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) were enjoying their near perfect life. Not ready to accept his early departure from the realm of the living, Sam is left walking the earth as a ghost. He is trapped, only able to witness the truth behind his murder and the threat that now surrounds Molly.With the help of Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) a spiritualist with a questionable history; Sam tries to solve the mystery and save the one he loves.The cast is very strong and they all deliver, the direction is sublime and the story is both complex enough to provoke your thinking and simple enough to captivate everyone. The result is a movie with many humorous moments, visuals that really work effectively, a love story that is very moving and a mystery that is thrilling to watch.Ghost is enjoyable time and time again, and it is still remembered for its originality and impact years later.8/10",8,4,6,7 January 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great Action/Adventure
","Introducing Indiana Jones, one of the finest Action Heros to grace the screen. Created by George Lucas, Perfectly Portrayed by Harrison Ford and Expertly Directed By Steven Spielberg, he couldn't be anything less could he? Indy is an Archaeologist who is charged with finding the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazi's, with the Help of Karen Allen Indy begins his quest for the prize, but the adventure leads him to his arch enemy, who is working for the Nazi's.Simply Brilliant.9/10",9,1,3,22 January 2005
Deja Vu," Intriguing and Original
","Deja Vu is a stunning blend of Action/Thriller and Sci-Fi that is somehow a very believable ride. Denzel Washington once again shows why he's on so many peoples favourite actors list, bringing so much character to the lead you simply have to want him to prevail.What i liked most of all about Deja Vu is the way it utilises the Sci-Fi without overpowering the movie; it doesn't often feel like a Sci-Fi film even though these elements are essential to the plot, and i think the the film makers deserve massive credit for this seamless blend, which is both captivating and at times extremely cool.I wouldn't say Deja Vu is flawless, but it is certainly well thought out, well cast and well executed, making it a very entertaining movie that most people should enjoy with ease.8/10",8,1,3,10 October 2007
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Very Charming and quite Touching
","E.T. is one of the most inspirational stories ever put into film; the heart warming tale of an alien life-form that is trapped in our world, 3 million light years from home; and its bond with a 10 year old boy named Elliot.The story is both charming and humorous, and it has some very touching moments, all captured beautifully by the genius of Steven Spielberg and the talents of the very young cast.E.T. is a very entertaining family movie, that is emotionally charged with a magical touch.7/10",7,1,2,1 January 2007
Minority Report," Top Sci/Fi Movie
","Based on a short story by Phillip K. Dick and borrowing a few ideas from others, Minority Report delivers good sci/fi, action and conspiracy.In the future, cops no longer wait until a murder is committed, they catch you before you do it and sentence you before you know what happened. All made possible by the predictive minds of the Pre-Cognatives, three experiments that didn't quite work out as planned.Detective John Anderson (Tom Cruise) heads the team that enforce this concept and he believes that the system is infallible, until his name is connected with the murder of a man he doesn't know. On the run he now has to find his Minority Report (the only proof of his innocence), the problem is, it is stored in one of the pre-cogs, well maybe it is? Cruise is forced to take drastic measures, to try and unveil a conspiracy and prove his innocence, the trouble is infallible systems are hard to disprove.With some great ideas and some cool visuals this movie is great entertainment.9/10",9,2,4,24 January 2005
G.I. Jane," An Enjoyable Flick
","Lt. Jordan O'Neil (Demi Moore) is selected to be the first female to enter the rigorous Navy S.E.A.L.S. training program, that has a 80% drop out rate.Although the story is difficult to take too seriously, it is done with plenty of believable looking scenes, good direction and a feel good, well dramatised screenplay. G.I. Jane is pretty enjoyable and can be entertaining for everyone not just feminists, as the theme of the movie would suggest.Watchable and fun, but it just has too many flaws to ever be anything more.6/10",6,3,8,7 January 2007

A really solid film.8/10",8,1,12,6 February 2005
Monty Python's Life of Brian," My Favourite Python Adventure
","I think its my favourite because it was my first experience of the Monty Python team's classic take on comedy. Before seeing the film i had the LP of the film, and i used to listen to it almost every day and could only visualise the movie. When i finally did see the film, it all feel into place and fitted perfectly with the image i had pictured.Brian, born at Christmas in the stable next door to Jesus, grows up and becomes a messiah after standing on someones foot. The movie follows his life from beginning to end, and it is littered will hilarious moments and characters.A triumph from the Monty Python crew, but if you don't like Python comedy, leave it alone.10/10 also watch the Holy Grail, and the Meaning of Life",10,4,10,23 January 2005
Erin Brockovich," Not the Norm
","I have to say that this is one of my favourite films, it's not the norm for Julia Roberts to play a role like this and i was very surprised how convincing she was. She was simply fantastic and my opinion of her has elevated dramatically.The film itself is very well directed and extremely well cast, all the main characters are portrayed brilliantly.The film is based on a true story and i feel that the producers dramatised the events in a powerful and touching way.I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone, it is great.9/10",9,3,5,11 March 2004
Meet the Parents," Great comedy
","Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is a male nurse, poised to propose to the woman he loves, Pam (Teri Polo) but the right thing to do would be to ask her father's permission first. During a weekend of getting to know them, he manages to make a strong impression; for all the wrong reasons. Her father (Robert De Niro) isn't quite what Greg has been led to believe, and right from the start he seems to have it in for his daughter's partner.De Niro and Stiller play off each other brilliantly, and both of them give fine comic performances, with a surprising level of depth for comedy characters. This film is packed with slick gags, hilarious scenes and it has a really fun story; it's a comedy film that you don't want to miss.8/10",8,53,70,23 January 2007
Se7en," Top Serial Killer Movie
","Somerset, (Morgan Freeman) a deeply Intellectual Detective, with barely a week left until his retirement and Mills, (Brad Pitt) the new cop in town, who is a pretty weak detective, are thrown together to investigate what at first appears to be another Homicide.After a second Victim is found, Somerset realises that this is no open and shut case, and requests that he is relieved, in light of his impending retirement. Mills gladly takes over the case and plunges himself in way over his head.As the work of a Crimally insane genius continues, Mills grows more and more erratic, and Somerset simply has to remain, to guide his young partner through the case, which ultimately leads to one of the finest climax's in movie history.With Wonderful Performances from both Freeman and Pitt and a really dark and morbid direction from David Fincher, the movie is crammed with suspense, intrigue and Excitement.My Favourite scene is John Doe (Kevin Spacey) tearing into Mills in the car, driving towards the Climax, the acting is simply perfect as Pitt's character is torn apart by the genius of the Criminally insane, and Freeman interjects with insightful rationality, demonstrating his superior mind. The Scene Carries such intensity, and at the same time encapsulates the primary characters basic elements. Most actors can't achieve this level of character depth, but these are three of the finest actors of our time. 9/10",9,33,44,30 January 2005
Fight Club," What did I wait for?
","I have finally got around to seeing this movie, and after all its hype and all its acclaim, I'm pleased to say it's deserving of it it all. I have gone out of my way to avoid this film for almost 5 years, often watching far inferior films instead, and now i have seen it, i can't think why?Edward Norton (Jack) is an insomniac who seeks solace in joining help groups for cancer, blood disorders, etc. and his addiction for them grows the more he attends. That is until he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and they form their own help group (FIGHT CLUB) where grown men can join and beat each other up to forget their troubles. And so an underground sect is formed, as Jack and Tyler's ideas spread like the plague, Jack soon realises that all is not quite what it seems.Brilliantly directed, and solid performances from all the cast, Fight Club is an undoubted winner, packed with action, slick dialogue, comedy, violence and much more.9/10 What are you waiting for - SEE IT!",9,3,8,19 February 2005
Memento," Wow, don't miss this one folks
","Guy Pearce first came to my attention as a seriously good actor in L.A. Confidential, and his performance in this film is probably better, it is certainly more focused. He portrays Leonard Shelby, a man suffering from short-term memory loss since the brutal rape and murder of his wife.Fighting against his condition and desperate to reap vengeance on the one responsible, he dedicates his life to tracking down the killer, and with only the knowledge that he keeps in the form of photos, notes and tattoos, its a long process.The direction and editing of this film are simply stunning, the story unfolds as we the viewing audience become one with Leonard on his trail of the killer. Pearce and the support performances from Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are all fantastic throughout the picture, so much so you will find it hard to take yours eyes off the screen.A seriously intriguing thriller, with an original plot that really works well; only a fool would miss a treat like this, so don't be a fool and watch it - you'll be glad you did.10/10 Masterful film, assured to be a classic",10,1,3,23 January 2007
Kickboxer," Good Martial Arts Flick
","Kickboxer is a gritty martial arts movie that is entertaining despite the predictable plot and shallow characters, the movie is a general feel good flick with some great fights and demonstrations of Van Damme's athleticism.Some interesting characters have been thrown in to lighten the feel and bring some humour to the film, and if you like this type of film it's very entertaining to watch.Call it what you like, cheesy, shallow, cheap, and i can't really disagree, but the essence of the film is successful, and it will definitely satisfy fans of the genre and of Van Damme.6/10 If you enjoyed this watch Bloodsport",6,1,1,20 January 2007
Shakespeare in Love," A Touching and very subtle Comedy
","In the times when Women were not allowed to act on the stage. A time when a young William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) was troubled with Writers block. Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) wanted nothing more than to perform on stage.The Lovely Viola, is set to marry Lord Wessex, but her desire to become an actress, leads her to dress as a man and she successfully auditions for a part in Shakespeare's Romeo and Ethel the pirate's daughter. Inspired by a forbidden love for Viola, Shakespeare's writers block is lifted and his play blossoms into Romeo and Juliet.This is a heart warming tale of forbidden love between an unlikely couple, and is delivered in a charming way, with subtle comedy undertones throughout.A Beautiful Film 8/10",8,4,7,30 January 2005
Dawn of the Dead," A Good Remake
","Dawn of the Dead was always one of the better Zombie films, and although this remake is not entirely true to the original, it is still a fine movie.Keeping the same basic plot, it successfully thrills and scares the audience with a new breed of zombie, (similar to the infected in 28 Days Later) the undead are pretty quick and therefore far scarier than the conventional slow paced zombies.The film has a strong and believable characters and plenty of action sequences, making it a highly enjoyable 95 minutes of blood soaked fun, if you like that kind of thing.8/10",8,2,3,19 January 2005
Alien: Resurrection," The All New Ripley
","Nice idea, Ripley the alien, the bad-ass hero cloned to become half human/half alien.QUESTION - Does it work?ANSWER - Yes, i think it just about does, without this twist on Ripleys character I think this movie could have been one too many. But, there are just about enough new ideas here to make one final outing the for the aliens (I quite like the offspring of Ripley and the alien at the end too, although it's a little cheesy)If you have been avoiding this, then give it a chance, it is not as good as the first two, so don't expect too much.7/10",7,8,13,22 January 2005

A mistake is made and Cole is sent back to the wrong time, and finds himself committed to a mental institution.Back and forth through time, Cole begins to gain the required information about the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and he finds out things are not what they seem, there not even close.With the Direction of Terry Gilliam, this weird and wonderful Sci/Fi proves to be a great film and has solid performances from both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt.Brilliant if you like this kind of thing 9/10",9,1,2,8 February 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Funny Zombie Flick
","Shaun of the Dead, while Hilarious, does at the same time pay respect to a Horror Genre loved by so many. Many of the horror scenes are humorously played out, but many are genuinely creepy, with an atmosphere to suit, that's not to say this is a really scary movie, just that it was not portrayed and a mockery or spoof of the genre.Shaun (Simon Pegg) and his Girl Liz (Kate Ashfield) are having a few problems in their romantic life, determined to correct his wrong doings, he sets out to win back her heart, only to find the streets are filled with Zombies and he, his friends, his family and his girl are in very real mortal danger.Fresh original comedy (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are Hilarious) that has an interesting story and is well produced and written, films like this don't come around very often.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," An Enjoyable Ride

In Short this film is Well cast and directed, it has great visual effects and is good entertainment, the problem is this, the film simply doesn't have enough story or character development to attain its quest for epic status or justify its length. Strange as it may seem, this is not a heavy criticism, because the film still carry's enough action, humour and charm to be an enjoyable one.Most people will love it, but i just like it.7/10 for the film 10/10 for Johnny Depp's performance (it is masterful)",7,1,4,28 January 2005
Hostel," A Bit of Sick Fun, that Feels Somewhat Pointless by the End
","Directed by Eli Roth 'Hostel' begins as a story of two young Americans backpacking through Europe, looking for fun, sex, drugs and more fun. This section of the film is quite sexually explicit (which seems to suit the Ora of the film) and it does introduce the characters with some depth.When the unsuspecting youths are lured into a secret murder for profit business as potential victims, the movie does become a very graphic gore-fest that is pretty disturbing despite the fairly obvious low budget effects.There is slightly more here than some people have given credit for, there is some reasonable acting on show, some strong ideas and a pretty interesting story for the most part. However, by the end of the movie i was left wondering what was the point! 6/10 its more than a just a gore-fest, but a classic it is not (maybe a cult movie one day, only time will tell)",6,0,0,11 October 2007
Madagascar," It's definitely no 'Shrek'
","Dreamworks add Madagascar to their list of CGI cartoons, where four pampered zoo animals from New York find themselves shipwrecked on the island of Madagascar.Voiced by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith, the animals soon learn its a jungle out there.Next to Shrek, Toy Story and Finding Nemo this is very poor, the CGI uses what appears to be a different technique (more cartoonish) and although it is impressive, it doesn't look as good. The biggest failing is this - only traces of the charm, humour, parody and magic that made the aforementioned films so good, still remain here, and it ends up as an OK kids film, that adults can watch without being bored to death; but nothing more.5/10",5,2,4,21 January 2007

On this epic voyage he gets to battle sharks, surf with some turtle dudes, dice with some jellyfish and survive an encounter in a whales stomach.All the characters are vibrant with Disney charm, but my favourite is Dory, the comic relief, probably one of the funniest Disney characters ever written and superbly voiced by Ellen DeGeneres, pure genius.All in all this is another success for Disney and Pixar, It brings out the child in all of us.Solid family fun 8/10",8,56,70,22 January 2005

Eligible bachelor Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) accepts a high-stakes bet that he can lure any woman into falling in love with him...also in 10 days.With the couple consistently tying to deceive one another, this turns out to be a pretty funny ride, and the chemistry between Hudson and McConaughey is excellent, which does help to hide the lack of depth in the story.I've seen better, but it's entertaining enough 6/10",6,25,37,14 January 2007
Hot Fuzz," In a Nutshell - Don't Miss It!
","After Shaun of the Dead, this second pairing of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost was very high on my wanted list, and it didn't disappoint in the least.Hot Fuzz is crammed full of excellent characters, ranging from the eccentric to the diabolical, and every one gets at least one laugh during the course of the movie and most of them get many more. I don't mean to suggest that this film is wall to wall gags; in fact it is far from it, instead it is just very clever and often very subtle humour that runs continuously throughout the film.Another pleasant surprise was the wonderfully impressive murder scenes, which were pretty gruesome and definitely stood out from the general vibe of the film, which made them far more involving. As well as the comedy and the murders, there is also a genuine sense of mystery surrounding these events and it definitely makes for compulsive viewing.Just in case all that wasn't enough to satisfy you, there is a very action packed and explosive end sequence that is so out of place and ludicrous it works like a charm, and simply caps the film off in style superbly.For me this film was every bit as good as Shaun of the Dead, and its definitely one of the best comedies ever made.9/10",9,123,160,11 October 2007

","Rick O'Connell (Brendan Frazer) leads the beautiful Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) to Hamunaptra (The City of the Dead) where reading from a book brings Imhotep (Pharaoh Seti I's High Priest) back to life.Once revived Imhotep has only one purpose in this world, to bring his love 'Anck Su Namun' back from the dead to join him, and will kill anyone who gets in his way.Although based on a Horror Theme, there is little horror on show here, but there are plenty of Great Action Moments, some brilliant visuals and some good humour.The dialogue is well written and punchy, this combined with some great characters bring the story to life and it turns out to be a terrific Film that is more Action/Comedy than Horror.8/10",8,86,95,25 January 2005
Constantine," I wanted so much More
","Everyone at work was raving about Constantine, saying how groundbreaking it was. So on the strength of that I went out and bought it, I wish i'd have checked IMDb first.My initial impression when i first saw it was pretty good, tinges of The Excorcist and Blade with a few new ideas and some great visuals. The story seemed pretty involved and had some interesting twists, and overall i felt that Constantine was pretty good, but not half as good as i had been led to believe.When i sat down again with my wife and watched it again i realised that the movie is actually pretty tedious the second time around. Now i wouldn't say it is a total let down, is does have some good moments and the story is OK, although not as deep as i first thought. The performances from the cast are adequate, and the visuals are top notch, but there is nothing here that justified the money i spent buying it.If i knew then what i know now i would have rented it instead.6/10",6,5,8,31 July 2005
Chicken Run," A Chicken's Quest for Freedom
","This beautifully animated movie is both charming and hilarious. It explores an age old concept of the quest for freedom using chickens trapped in a pen as the setting for the tale, and they are all given individual personalities by the excellent voices from the likes of 'Mel Gibson, Jane Horrocks and Julia Sawalha' Their life on Tweedy's farm is heading for a huge turn for the worse when Mrs Tweedy 'Miranda Richardson' has a better idea of how to make money. Their only hope is Rocky 'Mel Gibson' a Rooster who knows the way out, if only he hadn't broken his wing.Chicken Run is fresh, clever and very very funny, and it is a must see movie for all the family.8/10",8,1,1,29 December 2006
Terminator Salvation," I don't get the criticism???
","Terminator Salvavation takes us to the inevitable and lets us see the war and the rise of the machines. Kind of set in the future, but showing us the history behind the entire franchise.

Insomnia," Damn good thriller
","An LAPD detective, Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner are sent to an Alaskan town to help in the investigation of an horrific teen murder. In this town the sun never sleeps and as they close in on the killer his partner is also killed. With the perpetual daylight, the mind games of a reclusive writer (Robin Williams) who is the prime suspect and suspicions from an idealistic local cop (Hillary Swank) in regards to his partners death; Dormer is stretched to his psychological limit and is haunted by sleep deprivation.Pacino, Williams and Swank all deliver top performances in this tense and mysterious thriller, that keeps you under its spell until the conclusion.7/10",7,3,5,14 January 2007
L.A. Confidential," Top Notch Thriller
","This is one of those films that may pass you by if you chose to watch it when other distractions are around. Along with the Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction, i made several attempts to begin watching this movie, only find myself switching it off after 1/2 an hour or so due to distraction or lack of attention. Don't miss interpret what am i saying, this not a sign of a poor movie, in fact quite the opposite; it is merely a warning that films such as these require our undivided attention, and without it they may seem to be less than they are.L.A. Confidential is a terrific thriller set in the 50's, with very realistic characters and an accurate depiction of the corruption and issues of the period.The cast includes Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Bassinger and Danny Devito, and every one of them delivers a top notch performance, and i have to say Guy Pearce was surprisingly the one that shone the most.Not to be missed 9/10",9,5,9,23 January 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Not Awful, But Badly Flawed
","The build up to this disaster film is somehow far better than the aftermath. We are introduced to the main characters, told about their quirks, special talents, etc. and the scene is setup nicely for a damn enjoyable film. By the time the disaster hits most people will be pretty pleased with story so far and the effects during the disaster certainly don't disappoint at all.From here on in the movie falls apart. It quite simply becomes boring to watch and although the acting among the survivors is talented and believable it doesn't stop you thinking there should be more to enjoy. As usual for the genre, some of the science is flawed, and although this is often forgivable, the failure to keep the audience entertained, only makes them think about these flaws all the more.Ultimately 'The Day After Tomorrow' peaks too soon, and rather then build to a climax, it's over way before we are satisfied.6/10 should have been way better",6,9,14,30 December 2006
The Terminator," An Amazing Sci/Fi Action Movie
","In the future, we are at war with machines, and one man teaches the remains of Humanity how to win the war, that man is John Conner. The Machines send back a Killing machine, A Terminator (A super strong cyborg, that looks human) to kill the mother of mankind's saviour Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton). John Sends a protector for Sarah, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who volunteered, so he could meet the great legends Mother. The trouble is Sarah is no warrior (yet) and the Terminator will never eat, never sleep and never stop until she is dead.Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Terminator in one of his best roles ever, and he leaves many dead in his wake, as he hunts down his target. Sarah and Kyle are on the run, and it seems that their fate is sealed as the relentless Killing Machine, shows no signs of remorse and proves to be unstoppable time and time again.A Fantastic final sequence brings this movie to an awesome climax, that will go down in cinematic history as one of the best.9/10",9,5,6,5 February 2005
Hotel Rwanda," A very powerful and disturbing account
","Hotel Rwanda is the true story of a real life hero, who risked everything he had, too save as many as he could; while the governments of the world that could have helped, stood by and did nothing. Obvious comparisons have been made between this and Schindler's list, and the harrowing truths in both films do stir the emotions and enlighten the blind to the real tragedies in the world, but the films and the stories within them are very different.Just over ten years ago some of the worst atrocities in the history of mankind took place in the country of Rwanda, and yet in the media driven world in which we live; these events went almost unnoticed by the general public and were ignored by the powers that may have helped.Even without the production quality of Schindler's list, this film still proves to be equally as powerful; so much so, that i felt ashamed that such things had really happened during my adult life, and i'm sure anyone who sees this movie will feel the same way.Don Cheadle excellently portrays the hero, a ordinary man named Paul Rusesabagina, who offered shelter to over a thousand people at great risk to himself and his own family. Over a period of just three months; one million people were brutally murdered, and if one man managed to save over one thousand others, imagine how many could and should have been spared their terrible fate.The story simply has to move you, even if the film itself may appear a little cheap looking, but to me it isn't, it's realistic and shocking.9/10 Well done",9,1,1,13 January 2007
The Bodyguard," I quite enjoyed it
","The Bodyguard is fundamentally a love story between two contrasting characters with their own idiosyncrasies. The plot is intriguing enough to carry the film through and the romance between Costner and Houston builds steadily and realistically.With some decent action scenes, a decent cast and a great soundtrack, i found the Bodyguard to be an enjoyable movie.Clearly this film is not for everyone, it doesn't have enough action to satisfy the action fans, it isn't thrilling enough to be a thriller and as a pure romance film it is fairly weak; but i have to admit it does balance between these 3 genres quite well without excelling in any one of them.7/10",7,70,89,25 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The end of the Star Wars Saga
","Return of the Jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series, and is a fine conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. With Han Solo imprisoned by Jabba the Hut and the Empire building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side, and only our favourite heroes can pull it off.The Opening sequence, set on Tatooine, we see Jabba's palace, a pit of slavery and scum, and new home to Han Solo, as Luke and the gang prepare for his rescue, and with Luke's Jedi powers, they have the edge.We also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end. Han, Leia and Chewy battle it out on Endor, desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the Death Star. The Rebel Fleet led by Lando, battle with the Imperial Fleet while they wait for the shields to go down, and Luke has a final showdown with Darth Vader. An Epic end to a Classic Saga, and it's only just of the pace of the first two.10/10",10,20,29,3 February 2005
Final Destination 2," Same Concept, Different Story, Good Result
","Final Destination 2 uses exactly the same formula that worked the first time (so be warned if you didn't like the fist one you won't like this)The story is slightly different and manages to tie all the new characters into the characters from the first film and it does it well. The death scenes are better in this one, but the freshness is slightly tainted as you would expect from a sequel. Once again it is well cast and has a good script with the traditional sprinkle of cheese for the teen horror genre.Great sequel in every way and its damn close to being as good as the first film.7/10",7,1,2,2 January 2007
Blade II," Really Solid Sequel
","He's back, and this time he's teaming up with his arch enemies to hunt a new threat; reapers. They hunt down vampires and turn them into their own kind, plus they are almost as invulnerable as Blade himself.Blade has to lead the blood pack, a group of vampires trained to hunt him; they are the best the vampires have, but without blade they are no match for the reapers.More action, better special effects and a truly awesome performance by Luke Goss as the reaper, Blade 2 is sheer entertainment that is at least as good as the original, maybe even slightly better.8/10",8,29,57,24 December 2006
Alien," Still Awesome
","A classic movie is one that can stand the test of time. Alien does and it still looks stylish, even when it is compared to many movies that have borrowed ideas from it.What you don't see, scares you more, a premise that is very often attempted but rarely works. Ridley Scott managed to pull this off with style, he got the balance exactly right and the result is terrifying.Sigourney Weaver was an inspired selection as the now legendary character 'Ripley' (probably the first female action hero, certainly the best) and the supporting cast are all more than adequate.I can't deny that this film has dated a little, but when compared to other Sci Fi/Horror movies of the same era, you really can see how awesome this movie is. An undoubted classic that will terrify audiences for decades to come.9/10 and they may be a little harsh",9,2,5,15 January 2005
Closer," Movies like this Don't come along very often!
","Closer explores the possibility of love at first sight.Closer is an exploration of Love and Lust between multiple partners.Closer examines the deception and betrayal of the ones we love.The story focuses on two couples brought together by strange quirks of fate. Alice (Natalie Portman) a young woman, innocent; vulnerable and outrageously sexy. Dan (Jude Law) a pretty unsuccessful writer, who is genuine, honest and faithful. Anna (Julia Roberts) is a photographer, she is decisive, intelligent and beautiful and finally Larry (Clive Owen) a doctor, brilliant and successful.Four different characters, none of which are quite what they seem, as their individual relationships grow, so do their inner most desires to get what they want.Wonderfully directed by Mike Nichols, and with truly outstanding performances from all of the cast, Closer is in a class with films like 'American Beauty'.Almost entirely character driven, Closer is not for the casual viewer, the story gradually moves along, unfolding the characters backgrounds and emotions, cleverly weaving in some twists and shocks.Compelling, uncompromising, sexy, dramatic and at times tragic. Closer successfully stirs your emotions and captivates your attention from start to finish.Probably the best film of 2004 10/10",10,4,7,31 July 2005
Elf," Nice Family Christmas film
","Buddy (Will Ferrell) is a human brought up in the world of Elves at Santa's grotto in the North Pole by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). When he finally realises he doesn't seem to fit in, he asks Papa Elf and learns that his dad (James Caan) lives in New York and he's on Santa's naughty list. So off he goes on a quest to find him.Elf is charming and funny throughout and Buddy's naivety in the big apple is an over-used premise that works with charm. He also meets a department store Elf (Zooey Deschanel) bringing a little romance to the tale.OK its full of clichés and the basic plot has been done to death, but the film is still a winner that cannot fail to entertain on some level.7/10",7,2,3,1 January 2007
Lost in Translation," Interesting?
","Bill Murray is Bob, a movie star who is in Tokyo to shoot a whiskey commercial. Scarlett Johansson is Charlotte, she is a young wife who is tagging along with her workaholic husband. When they both become lost in a city where they feel alienated by the culture and the language, they both suffer with insomnia and are left dealing with their loneliness. When they cross paths in a luxury hotel bar they strike up an intimate friendship, and begin to explore the great city together.Murray and Johansson both deliver stunning and insightful performances, and their is some subtle humour along their journey through Tokyo. Sadly, however good each element in this film is, the result is somewhat boring at times, OK the film is about human connection and loneliness, and the character depth is great (even without much development) but this alone does not make a interesting movie. I couldn't help feeling the movie had little real point, it has all the ingredients of a masterpiece, except one - the story.6/10 for trying",6,1,3,21 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Force is strong in this one
","With the Phantom menace out of the way, Lucas can now build on the foundation he laid out and take us towards the story we Star Wars fans want. Attack of the Clones delivers the Star Wars magic once again, and brings the Jedi to the fore, in a war between them and the Dark Side, that even Yoda cannot see coming.With some more familiar feeling characters, than in the Phantom Menace, and with far less Jar-Jar, the movie entertains with ease, as it begins the story of Anakin's decent to the dark side and his romance with Padme. We also see the Emporer begin his manipulation of the Senate.But above all, this movie has two truly awesome Jedi Sequences at the end. The first is a Gladiator style battle, that quickly becomes an outstanding JEDI/Clone/Droid/Sith War, and it is spectacularly executed. The Second is what every Star Wars Fan has waited for since Empire Strikes Back. Yoda doing his Jedi Thing, and it is simply perfect (its kind of weird, almost funny at first) but is certainly doesn't disappoint.

Forrest Gump," Simply Unmissable and Totally Unforgettable
","This movie is the story of a little boy with below average intelligence, but with a heart that's worth far more than a few little I.Q. points.Tom Hanks delivers this outstanding character to the screen and his performance is truly captivating; just like the story of his life. The Beautiful Robin Wright brilliantly portrays Forrest's most cherished friend and childhood sweetheart, Jenny. And this review wouldn't be complete without thanking Gary Sinise and Sally Field for their wonderful contribution to this truly heartwarming experience.Forrest's story sees him touch the hearts of the entire world with his simple innocence and strong will to do only what is right; making life better for many people along his journey.Forrest Gump is a movie that you feel as you watch, you will empathise with the character of Forrest, sharing his experiences whether they are humorous, heartwarming or tragic. And along this journey you will learn a great deal about life and its many twists of fate.Good enough to inspire everyone, even the most cold hearted among us.10/10 Unmissable, Unforgettable, Brilliant",10,6,14,5 January 2007

Bridget Jones's Diary," Great Light Entertainment
","Bridget Jones's Diary is a very entertaining and very light romantic comedy that is well written, well cast and subtlety humorous from start to finish. Renee Zellweger captures the character of Bridget very well, quickly allowing the audience to empathise with her vulnerabilities and relationship issues, and thankfully Hugh Grant and Colin Firth support her excellently along with the rest of the cast.On the down side, I did find some of the scenes a little cringe worthy to endure and i did feel that there were not enough laugh out-loud moments.All in all Bridget Jones's Diary is a winner, and although better suited to a female audience; is still has enough to entertain most fans of the genre.7/10",7,1,1,28 December 2006
Notting Hill," Very Fine Romantic Comedy
","Not usually impressed with Romantic Comedies, i found this one strangely compelling. It really was a nice movie, littered with great characters, especially Spike played by Rhys Ifans (Hilarious).The story demonstrates to the extreme that love can occur between the most unlikely of people, and the humorous portrayal of this, is both touching and realistic. And i mean realistically created, not necessarily true realism.Worthy of your attention, this well written romantic comedy is a must for fans of the genre and is a good gamble if your not.8/10",8,61,76,26 January 2005
The Aviator," An Very Interesting Movie
","I Found the Aviator very compelling to watch and enjoy, despite its length i felt it was perfectly paced and captured my interest very early on in the film. Some of the visuals in the movie are a brilliant demonstration of how to utilise modern effects and keep them realistic, and although used throughout the movie, at no time do they look out of place.Great credit has to go to the cast, who all produced fine performances. In particular Dicaprio who captured Hughes's excentricity with imagination and conviction and Blanchett, who successfully brings Hepburn to life.BUTScorcese has to take most of the credit for the film's success, he really does capture the audience with his stylish direction. This is not his greatest achievement, but its damn good.8/10",8,1,1,22 October 2005

(I hope not to many people deal with them quite like this though) American Pie delivers exactly this and plenty more. With some truly hilarious characters and some terrific dialogue, this film will have you in stitches, and contains scenes that will be laughed about for years.As teen comedy films go, this is up there with the best of them, highly recommended 9/10",9,10,16,15 January 2005

He wakes to find he has no memory of who he is and he needs answers fast if he is to survive the attempts to erase his existence.The Bourne Identity is excellently paced and brings a great deal of realism to the spy genre. The fight sequences are fast and believable, the car chases are accurately choreographed and the character of Jason Bourne is vulnerable and easy to identify with.Matt Damon plays the role with apparent ease, he simply slips into the character and brings him to life. As spy thrillers go The Bourne identity one of the best around.8/10",8,85,120,27 December 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," It grew on me
","Unlike most people, i wasn't trying to be first in the queue to see this film, I have never read the books and wasn't taken in by the hype. When i finally saw this film, i was impressed with the visuals, but found the story disjointed (clearly 3 hours isn't long enough to build the characters and portray the story in the way the books do) For fans of the books, i appreciate that you've all been waiting a long time for this trilogy, and i can see, without reading the books that they have done a good job at bringing the books to life. My criticism is this, for people who don't know the characters and the story, the film misses out too much content that i'm sure must be in the books.That aside i watched it again and have to admit that it grew on me, i got into the characters a little more and found an enjoyable movie with some masterful visual effects.8/10",8,4,7,23 January 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Successfully shatters its own illusions
","By the time this film was released i was a Matrix-oholic, after Neo used his powers outside the Matrix and stopped sentinals in their tracks, leaving him unconscious. I was desperate to see this movie and was first in the queue at the cinema.Neo somehow has entered a state of limbo between the real and the Matrix and then manages to get out - i forget exactly how, (it was a while ago and i haven't watched it again). Anyway, with sentinels (alot of them) closing in on Zion, time is running out for what's left the human race.Neo figures out how he can beat the machines, but he's not letting us know just yet, so he and Trinity take a ship and set off to the machine city, so Neo can do what his has to do.Meanwhile, the sentinels attack Zion (The best action sequence in the film, by far) it all takes place in the real world, but it is done with style.As Trinity and Neo make their way to the machine city, SHOCK, Trinity dies; this worked well. But, then Neo has a chat with the machines and gets them to plug him in to the Matrix to defeat agent Smith, who is running amok and threatening the destruction of both man and machine. Neo, now fighting to save both sides has a showdown with Smith that is at best disappointing (it was like Superman fighting the super villains in Superman 2 - not disrespect to superman, he can carry a fight like this off)) the effects were better but, it wasn't good. Anyway, Neo wins with the help of the Oracle and then he dies, and the machines carry him off like a hero.I admit that my recollection of these events is a little vague, but the feeling they left me with was one of shattered illusions, they just seem to have ran out of ideas for this one, and it was a huge let down.I have read a few good reviews, that say their is more than meets the eye here. So i will watch it again, because i would love to be wrong in my perception. If i am wrong i will post a new comment, but for now i'll leave you with this, Most of the film is outside the Matrix and most of these scenes did deliver, but inside the Matrix the fights were quite tired. One is a rehash of the lobby scene in the original and the other is a Superman style borathon. Additionally the story loses itself and its original motives, leaving too many holes and unanswered questions.Just 6/10 and that's kind.",6,2,4,24 January 2005

","Without Danny Boyle in the Director's chair, i feared that the essence that made '28 Days Later' so good would get lost; but Juan Carlos Fresnadillo clearly knows how to keep a winning recipe, and once again we are treated to a fine horror movie.'28 Weeks Later' doesn't hang around before it gets going, it's pretty much straight into the action and horror, and once its there it keeps going at a steady pace throughout. The story is well constructed, and everything falls into place nicely, leaving just enough to the viewers imagination to keep our minds stimulated.The dark and creepy tone that succeeded in the first film is retained, and the infected once again bring real terror to the screen, but the all new cast inject enough freshness to make this film every bit as good as the first, with some excellent stunts and action sequences thrown in for good measure.If you enjoyed the first outing for the infected, this is quite simply a must see movie.Credit to everyone involved, it's a sequel to be proud of! 9/10",9,1,2,8 October 2007

It is simply the story of one's mans struggle against nature and a test of his will, and without question it works well.Cast Away is realistic, fascinating, touching and honest 7/10 If its thrills that you're after then avoid it like the plague.",7,1,2,29 December 2006

","John Carpenter brings us this Brilliant remake of the thing from another world. An alien is found in the Antartic, frozen in time awaiting its chance to live again. It shape-shifts into whatever it kills and then it kills again.Carpenter achieves Horror in two ways, one is the very Graphic Alien Scenes, which are both Horrific and very Visual. The other method he uses is far more subtle and effective, he shows us into the Psyche of the Potential Victims, their Fear and Paranoia are captured wonderfully, creating some great moments of Suspense and Tension.The Cast all deliver good performances and Kurt Russell gives a performance that is very different to his all action Snake type role. He shows us that he really can act and he personifies carpenters ideas perfectly.Top Horror Sci/Fi 9/10",9,6,10,5 February 2005

There were a great deal of laughs too (mostly intentional) anyone who hasn't seen this but just wants relax and enjoy a good (yet Shallow) action flick then this certainly fits the bill.For pure entertainment value i score it 8/10If this is for you then check out The Core and Independence Day, avoid the Day after Tomorrow and Deep Impact, there not really for action fans.",8,244,370,15 January 2005

","A cross country road trip turns bad when the family is left stranded in New Mexico, miles from civilisation. A clan of genetic mutants, with a thirst for blood are watching them, planning their attack on the unsuspecting family.The Hills have Eyes is a very gruesome and spine chilling horror flick that surpasses the original made by Wes Craven. The characters are very well fleshed out before the carnage begins, and it really helps to bring a real sense of compassion for the impending victims.The cast all portray the terror of the situation very convincingly, and the character evolution runs nicely along side the story and the events within it. The Direction captures the tension and the sheer brutality of the plot effortlessly and this, coupled with the realistic and stomach churning visuals, heightens the impact of movie very effectively.7/10 Not a film for the feint of heart",7,1,1,13 January 2007
American Psycho," A faithful translation to the big screen?
","Ever read the book? Hard work wasn't it? I don't mean this as an insult to 'Bret Easton Ellis' work, he simply had to use this intense attention to detail to deliver us the character of Bateman. So i for one was very pleased to find that this was carried over to film successfully (apart from the glaring omission of the violence and gore).Mary Harron, bravely chose to leave these scenes to suggestion, running the risk of reprisal from critics everywhere.Did Mary Harron chose correctly? I say absolutely yes! Given the relatively low budget of the film, the complexity of the story and the characters and the difficulty in displaying such harrowing and sick sexual and murderous visuals, 'American Psycho' could have quite easily become a very disjointed slasher movie, and thankfully it doesn't.Instead 'American Psycho' is a wonderfully satirical look at Yuppie life in the 80's, and the idea of living the dream at the expense of the soul. Christian Bale captures the character of Bateman with perfection, and he takes us on the decent into madness with him.Overall this is a faithful translation to the big screen, which is in many ways more entertaining than the book. My thanks to Mary Harron and Christian Bale for this achievement.8/10",8,1,2,6 February 2006

Only programmed to give the appearance of intelligence the hologram's purpose is unclear, but is enough to sow the seeds of doubt in Will Smith's already suspicious mind.Investigating a murder he believes was perpetrated by a robot, Smith proceeds to pursue the robot in question, revelling a whole lot more than he would have wished for, and discovering a great deal more about his foe than he expected.Stunning visuals, fast paced action and plenty of decent surprises all contribute in making this a fine Sci/Fi Thriller, thats not quite as good as the hype but still well worth a watch.8/10",8,4,6,22 January 2005
American Beauty," Just for the people who missed this Masterpiece.
","At over 5 years old this movie has probably been seen by most people already. But just in case it did pass you by, for whatever reason, i suggest that you see it as soon as possible.The characterisation is sublime and has not to my knowledge been matched since, every stereotypical character is so realistically portrayed, by a combination of fine acting, great writing and excellent direction; that you feel a connection with everyone in the movie.I won't try and link this film with any particular genre, as i believe it stands out on its own, but i will say this. Whatever kind of film you usually go for, 99% of you will like this one, and most of you will love it.Look closer and you will find an absolute gem.10/10",10,8,15,5 January 2005
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," This Terminator Sequel, may prove to be the best sequel ever made.
","After failing to kill Sarah Conner, the Machines are now trying again, only this time their after John Conner himself, as a boy. Sarah Conner is labelled insane after trying to burn down Cyberdyne Systems, the company that hid the remains of the first terminator she destroyed, and she is committed to a mental institute. John Resents his mother for the way he was brought up, and now lives with his foster parents.Again the machines send a Terminator the T-1000, but the resistance have one of their own. Sent back to protect John, Arnie is the same make and model, but has a new mission, this time he's on our side.Is Arnie a match for the new T-1000, a liquid metal terminator that can morph into anything it samples by physical conduct. Groundbreaking special effects and non stop action sequences ensue as the war between Terminator's boils into one of the finest action movies of all time.Simply Brilliant in every way.10/10",10,22,25,5 February 2005
Heartbreak Ridge," Impressive
","Clint Eastwood stars, directs and produces this very fine tale of a hardened US Marine who takes charge of a group of misfit recruits. He has to show these men how to be marines, while at the same time fighting against his superior officers, his new platoon and his feelings for his ex-wife.Heartbreak Ridge is a very gritty and realistic feeling movie, Eastwood delivers a typically brilliant performance, and his direction is very compelling. The whole cast lends great support, but Eastwood undoubtedly steals most of the credit.Packed with humorous moments, clever and interesting dialogue and plenty of easy to like characters; not to mention some pretty decent action.8/10 A fine film",8,7,12,11 January 2007
Being John Malkovich," Good, But Not For Everyone
","A truly original example of movie making, the concept of the movie is very refreshing and the gags are fresh and funny.Great direction, great cast and overflowing with fresh ideas, this film is a breath of fresh air.There is a problem though, it is certainly not for everyone; it is very weird and is more likely to attain a cult status in movie history than it is to become a true classic.That said, i did enjoy it immensely, and would recommend it to every movie lover who fancies something a little different.Try it, you might like it, and if you don't, what have you lost? 8/10",8,12,26,16 January 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Excellent comedy treat
","Andy Stizer (Steve Carrell) has a job, a nice apartment, a collection of action figures and his virginity. When his buddy's at work learn the truth, their quest becomes, helping Andy with the female of the species. A hilarious series of painful, sexual and eye-opening events ensues, and Andy's life will never be the same again.Steve Carrell plays the role superbly well, capturing the innocence and vulnerability of his character with ease, along with a strong script and a talented supporting cast '40 year old virgin' is one of the freshest comedies in recent years, and should be enjoyed by everyone.8/10 Hilarious and definitely recommended",8,2,4,23 December 2006
Face_Off," An All Action Movie that's a Winner
","FBI Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) desperate to avenge the death of his son; uses radical new surgery to become his arch enemy Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), but when Castor wakes from his coma and becomes Sean, he finds himself trapped in the life of of his nemesis and unable to protect his family.With relentless John Woo style action sequences, cutting edge stunts and special effects, thrilling storyline and great performances from Cage and Travolta, Face Off is a cut above most of the action movies out there. It's terrific entertainment.8/10",8,4,7,2 January 2007
Jarhead," Realistic and Insightful
","This film is based on a real account, written by a real US Marine; and it certainly seems to depict the Gulf War in a extremely believable way. We see the story through eyes of Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) It's his journey through Marine life, from the trials of initiation and training, through the mental anguish of the politics and the loneliness, to the scars that get left on the mind.Sam Mendes directs this picture exquisitely, capturing the imagery, the darkness and the emptiness of the conflict. All of the cast from Jake Gyllenhaal's lead to Chris Cooper's 60 seconds of screen time, are brilliant, every character is real, every word that they speak is part of an overall statement and the cinematography is sublime.This movie is a truly gritty and insightful journey through the war, at no time does it try and falsify emotions or disguise the true images; yet it isn't what is generally considered to be a war film. There are no hero's or high octane action sequences in this picture; just plenty of guts and an artistic approach.8/10 A film for purists, not thrill seekers",9,2,3,15 January 2007
Collateral," One of Cruise's Finest Performances
","Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a ruthless, yet cool and calculating killer, Max (Jamie Foxx) is a cabbie. A quirk of fate throws the pair together when Vincent uses Max's cab as transport between hits.The result is a first rate thriller that is totally compelling and thoroughly entertaining. Despite Vincent's relentless and cold nature the viewing audience will still find it hard to dislike him, and this is due to the fantastic character portrayal that Cruise pulls off.Michael Mann's direction is as good as you have come to expect, with films such as (Last of the Mohicans, Heat and Ali) and even though he didn't write this, that doesn't detract from the movie experience.It would be wrong of me not to mention the performance of Jamie Foxx, as it is also great.Overall Collateral is a top film, and a must see for thriller fans.9/10",9,3,6,31 July 2005
The Machinist," It's a dark and delicious treat
","Christian Bale is Trevor Reznik, he has not slept for a year and he is ravaged by exhaustion, his body is little more than bones and his weary mind is playing tricks on him. After a serious accident where his neglect sees a co-worker lose a arm, he becomes haunted by his guilt and he begins to find cryptic notes in his flat, while he is stalked by man, wherever he goes.Brad Anderson creates and sustains a very creepy and dark Ora throughout the film; filling it with haunting imagery and clever camera work. Christian Bale is simply mesmerising in this role, and he must have starved for months to capture the characters physical appearance. He is excellently supported by Jennifer Jason Leigh, a prostitute who seems to be the only one he can trust.The Machinist is truly compulsive viewing and despite similarities to the feel of Fight Club and the structure of Memento; this film does stand alone on it's own merits.8/10",8,11,19,21 January 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," At Last Harry 's Getting Powerful
","Harry's third outing, is the best yet. Some new characters and some key historical pieces of the plot are weaved into the story. This movie is far darker than the first two and Harry is growing up and growing into the powerful wizard that he is supposed to be. No longer always in Hermione's shadow Harrys magical powers are needed now more than ever, stalked as he is by the Dementors (these are cool) This movie uses some cool tricks, some great visuals and has plenty of story developments. The only disappointment for me was how pathetic Draco Malfoy has become (he is a wimp, of the highest order), and i was looking forward to him and Harry having some good battles later in the series.Again Harry Potter delivers in this his best outing to date.9/10",9,3,7,22 January 2005
Aliens," Different from the Original (and one of the best sequels in existence)
","This time its James Cameron who is charged with bringing the alien to the screen, an entirely different approach is used and it has to be said that this sequel is not as scary as the original, however it is slightly better (probably because it was made 7 years later and visual effects were much improved).This time we get to see the alien in all its glory and the frights are due to the sheer number of them terrorising the heavily armed soldiers intent on destroying them.This is definitely less of a horror film and more of an action movie. I think the reason that it works so well is that everyone was is ready to see the aliens in all there terrifying splendour, and had the sequel tried to recreate the suspense of the original would undoubtedly have failed.Sci-Fi action at it's very best 10/10",10,8,13,15 January 2005
The Exorcist," A Horror Classic
","This is a very highly rated horror movie for a good reason, when it was realised it broke the mould of everything that preceded it, and set the standard for the horror genre for decades to come; because of this it should retain its place Movie history forever.The sheer terror this movie instilled in people, during the year of its release is even today unmatched by anything. Time, however has altered its effect on its audience, we simply are not as easily shocked as we used to be.For anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet, my advice is this, approach it with an open mind, and remember when it was made, this is the only way you will appreciate it for what it is.Difficult for new audiences to appreciate, but it is still a classic, time won't change that.8/10",8,14,19,31 January 2005
Ocean's Eleven," Smart Crime Thriller
","A remake of a rat pack film, this was a brave venture to take on, and thank you Steven Soderbergh for this valiant effort. Retaining a good cast, Soderbergh has modified this movie to fit with the times, and he has helped create a very slick and stylish thriller.Danny Ocean, wants to pull off the crime of the century, by ripping off three Casino's at the same time, while at the same time settling a score or two with the casino's owner. With the help of ten others, he might just do it. Or is he not quite as smart as he appears to be.8/10 Recommended",8,39,57,26 January 2005
The Usual Suspects," A Very Memorable Crime Thriller
","Five Suspects, one line up, and a puppet master pulling their strings. The Story is told by Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) while being questioned by the police. The Line up is no coincidence, and the usual suspects are all suspicious, and we, the viewers are deeply confused.The Cast is simply brilliant (Kevin Spacey's first Oscar was well deserved) and no-one's performance is weak. The Direction by Bryan Singer is quite incredible, this is not an easy film to make work, it really is very complicated and the truth is very well guarded.Despite your enjoyment, you will feel confused for much of the time, puzzling over the various plot elements as they intertwine and twist you around, but its all down to the clever direction, there are not many movies out there, like this one. The good news is this - the ending is totally satisfying, and that alone is a rare thing to witness.Despite the complexity, this film works, but if you don't give it your full attention, it may just pass you by. And that would be criminal! 9/10",9,1,2,8 February 2005
Dirty Dancing," Very Good Film, Just Not My Cup Of Tea
","I'll start by saying that there is very little wrong with this film; it has a great cast, a charming story, strong dialogue and some excellent characters; not to mention a good soundtrack.I did enjoy this movie and i can understand why so many people hold it in such high regard, it's a fine film; the only thing that lets it down for me is the subject matter, dancing isn't really my thing. So my score of 6/10 is a testimony to how good a film this really is, for a film of this type to entertain me, even just a little surprised me completely. There is simply nothing to hate here, as it tells the story of a girls journey into womanhood, and the dancing is simply the catalyst for the change.",6,4,11,31 December 2006
The Commitments," Raw and Real
","A terrific story of a struggling Dublin band who have to deal with the political struggles of artistic disagreement and Street life for the lower classes.Beautifully crafted, this movie is engrossing, raw and realistic and it contains one of the finest soundtracks ever recorded, performed by some truly talented musicians.Brilliantly cast and a well written slick script, this film is a must for any blues lover.Not for everyone, but still a great filmA Solid 8/10",8,4,8,17 January 2005
Independence Day," I Love this Movie for what it is
","Independence day achieves exactly what it sets out do. It makes you Wow! at the visual effects and it entertains you with all out action for a couple of hours.Sure, the plot's quite obvious and characters are a little cheesy and gung-ho, and yes there is a lot of sentiment that doesn't always fit the movie. But lets be honest, if anyone expected this film to be clever or insightful than there looking at the wrong genre.The truth is this film does have the following elements -1/ Loads of action.2/ Great special effects.3/ Humorous characters.4/ Passable even if slightly cheesy script. 5/ Some mildly touching moments.Like i said, if you want deep, meaningful and thought provoking then your not watching the right movie. Try 2001, A Space odyssey or even Contact; but if you want to unplug your mind and watch the a couple of hours of well produced action, then i think you'll like it.I give it 9/10 (at least it doesn't pretend to be something that is isn't.)",9,3,7,22 January 2005
The Butterfly Effect," One of the best movies i saw in 2004
","For a Start Aston Kutcher does a surprisingly good job in this role, easily his best film to date (although that alone is not really a good reason to watch this) As with all movies that play with the notion of altering time, there are plot holes (and some of them are big - e.g. why are his journal entries always the same, regardless of what he has changed?) If you can get passed these plot holes, and view this film without trying to find them and just go with it, you'll find a massively enjoyable film. As you may all already be aware, there are two versions of the film (well the Ending) and they both have completely different appeal, for me the directors ending is superior, it is more unexpected and far more shocking, but it does end the film on a slight downer, which is why the original release was happier (even though it didn't really fit the film) Definitely worth watchingOriginal Release 6/10 Directors cut 8/10",8,66,99,16 January 2005
Alien vs. Predator," I Quite like it as an action movie, but it should have been more than this.
","As a straight forward action flick, AVP has a place in the market; but here are two of the finest aliens to previously grace our screens, and frankly they deserved more.The Aliens, probably the finest monsters in film history, have always been the ultimate prey for a race of Predators, for centuries man has worshipped these beasts, and every one hundred years we have laid sacrifice to the Predators by offering ourselves as hosts to the Aliens, in order for them to partake in the ultimate hunt.In Antarctica, 2000 Metres beneath the ice; a ancient pyramid is found by Weyland Industries. Charles Bishop Weyland assembles a team to venture into the find, only for them to become very welcome additions in the battle of the species.The problem is the sheer enormity of the movie, battle between two movie giants such as these should have never been attempted; this concept is never going be truly embraced by fans of either movie franchise and in particular fans of the Alien movies.As i said this isn't all bad, but it does fail to capture the imagination and terror of the Alien movies, and the action of the original Predator film.If you have to watch it, then watch it; but don't expect more than an action flick. 6/10",6,2,3,13 February 2006
Batman Begins," And i thought the Combination of Tim Burton and Michael Keaton was as good as its gonna get?
","I loved Batman and Batman Returns, Tim Burton's direction and Michael Keaton's Batman were really good, and seemed to be the best we were ever going to get.I'm glad to say that i was wrong, Christopher Nolan has taken the character of Batman to the very beginning, fleshing out the characters of both Bruce Wayne and Batman down to the finest details. Nolan's use of realism in the creating the Batman character makes him more believable than ever.Christian Bale quite simply personified the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman and actually puts everyone else's portrayal in the shadows. Bale is supported by a wonderful cast, including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and more, but i found Cillian Murphy's performance as Dr. Jonathon Crane to be one of the finest in the movie.Overall Batman begins is an very honest, detailed and compelling adaptation of the Batman character, that is worthy of the recognition it has received. For Bat fans and movie lovers alike; this is a must see.9/10",9,5,5,13 February 2006

With a huge career changing case that is based solely on lies about to go to trial, he is stuck in an unfamiliar position, that may just change his life.Jim Carrey is on top form for this one, giving one of his most hilarious performances to date, he is well supported by the likes of Jennifer Tilly, Swoosie Kurtz and Amanda Donohue, and the winning concept of the movies theme realises its potential.7/10 Great fun",7,26,34,20 January 2007
Meet the Fockers," Good follow up
","It's time to meet the Fockers (Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman) are Greg's parents, they are a fun loving, open minded and free spirited; basically the complete opposite of Pam's parents, and just maybe getting them together isn't such a great idea after all.Once again De Niro and Stiller play off each other well, but we also have the added injection of humour from Hoffman and Striesand, who clash hilariously with De Niro's stuck up character.There's plenty of fresh material, a similar yet still entertaining story and a fine cast that really performs. This is a strong sequel, and its only a little off the pace of the first.7/10",7,1,2,23 January 2007
Saving Private Ryan," A Great War Epic, with plenty of substance
","The opening sequence, is without doubt.1/ The most Harrowing and Horrific depiction of War that i have ever seen.2/ The Best Movie Sequence to test out your surround sound system that i've ever encountered.After learning that 3 out 4 of Mrs. Ryans Sons have all died in combat during various missions in World War II, It is decided that her last remaining son will not be allowed to die in battle, and a small group of soldiers is assembled to get Private Ryan out.Spielberg has undoubtedly captured the feel and the gloom of War, and has certainly avoided unnecessary Dramatisation. With a Top Class Cast, a Great Director and a Powerful Story, Saving Private Ryan is probably one of the finest movies ever made.10/10",10,3,6,30 January 2005
28 Days Later...," A Cracking Zombie style horror, with substance
","28 Days Later successfully takes the zombie genre to a new level, this movie is far more than just a horror flick. There are some great characters, that you actually care about, some you'll like, some you'll be glad to see killed, but all solidly performed.The story is well written and avoids the clichéd cheesy scripts that are too often attached to the horror genre. And I must add that the direction is exactly what you would expect from 'Danny Boyle' top class.For me though the real difference between this movie and many others made in this genre is as follows - The infected (the zombie like folk) are more menacing, they turn instantly and they move fast, a combination that would instill fear in every one of us.I don't mean to run down the zombie movie genre - I am a huge fan of most of these films, but lets be honest its been done to death, re-animated and done again, and this was the first movie to break the mould and transcend to a new level.If you like your horror flicks, then this is certainly worthy of your attention.9/10",9,130,181,23 December 2006
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," More of a showpiece than the first, but it's left lacking depth
","It does exactly what it says on the back of the DVD and i quote - 'The blockbuster sequel with even more dinosaurs, more action and more breathtaking visual effects than its record breaking predecessor'However it does this at the expense of the character development and the plot; both of these are compromised to give more screen time to the dinosaurs and the action sequences, so it really comes down to what you are after in a film. If it's fairly good action and stunning CGI dinosaurs and chases that you want, this film delivers; if your after something with a bit more depth then you may be left wanting.Personally i found this was great fun to watch, but i found myself routing for the dinosaurs, they had more character than the cast, don't get me wrong, the cast is sufficient, their just not as compelling to watch as the dinosaurs.7/10 for the fun of the experience",7,1,2,17 January 2007
Hellboy," Don't expect too much, and you should enjoy it
","Firstly, I just have to comment on Ron Pearlman's performance as Hellboy, he breaths life into the character and makes him great fun to watch.The basic story is kind of 'X-men meets Men in Black'.Hellboy and sadly only a couple other mutant type characters are used to defend Earth from dark forces, intent of taking over the world. With very strong visuals, some fine characters and an action packed storyline, this movie is entertaining, amusing and great fun.Kids will undoubtedly love it (I know my son does) although some scenes are not for young kids, and most people should think it is at least good entertainment, but don't expect too much as you may be disappointed.Good fun for most 6/10",6,2,3,22 January 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Enjoyable
","After the first movie i was looking forward to this one, not having read the books, i didn't know what was coming next.All the characters were there again, even Gandalf, who i thought was dead (ahh, but this time he's Gandalf the white) the visuals were as good as expected and some of the cinematography blew my mind.For me though, Golem stole the show, a very compelling computer generated character like nothing I've seen before. Well done to the special effects crew. The story developed with some interesting revelations along the way and all in all I was satisfied with another chapter of the trilogy.8/10",8,2,2,23 January 2005
Schindler's List," A Harrowing Experience, but a worthwhile one
","I have very recently seen this movie for the first time, and i have to say that it was a truly Harrowing Experience, this is definitely a break from Spielberg's usual style, the charming, inventive and visionary direction is neither present, or needed.This movie is dark and graphic reality, and it's depiction of the holocaust is one that i will never forget.Watching this movie is a very worthwhile experience, if it fails to make you think or it fails move you and stir your emotions, then i'm afraid you may have passed away and are not aware of it.A Masterpiece in film making, that is Awesome to witness.I have to give it 10/10",10,9,14,31 January 2005
The Incredibles," Fit for any Superhero
","Disney's imagination and Pizar's awesome animation techniques combine once again to produce another slice of fun for the whole family.The Incredibles is faithful to the superhero genre, albeit with a tongue in cheek humour that operates on several levels beneath the simplistic yet effective storyline. With plenty of laugh out loud moments and some more subtle humorous undertones, the incredibles has enough to entertain most of us.Although the Incredibles lacks the charm and sentiment of Finding Nemo, it makes up for it with action and excitement, and it's a different movie experience. This is the action movie of the animation genre.8/10 recommended to anyone who enjoys Disney/Pixar productions, it's not the best, but it's up there.",8,2,4,2 July 2005
I Am Legend," Watch the movie first, then read the book, it is possible to enjoy both!
","I watched this movie years ago, and very deliberately avoided the book until i had.I am Legend the movie is a tense, sometimes creepy, sometimes heart breaking movie of substance and quality. Will Smith does an outstanding job and I found the story and the message of the this movie compelling and powerful.Then there is Matterson's novel. It is completely different and is seeded purely in the horror with a very different meaning to the 'I am Legend' title.I get people hating this movie for what the filmaker's did to the story in relation to the book. But this movie is great in it's own right and I personally love the movie and the book, I just see them as completely different stories.Great film 8/10",8,1,1,10 June 2020
School of Rock," Jack Black, he's Da Man!
","Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a down and out Wannabe Rock Star, who poses as a substitute teacher and tries to mould his class into a rock band.Jack Black is simply way over the top, with every aspect of his performance, but in way that only he can be, and in a way that makes this movie come to life a little more with every gag and every rock score.With support from a large cast of children, there are some fine performances from the young talent on show here. Maybe we'll see some of these faces again.All in all a really entertaining and outrageous movie, that is both fun to watch and satisfying to enjoy.8/10",8,4,7,30 January 2005
The Game," Glad he's not my Brother
","What an amazing thriller, it's totally original, i've never seen anything like it before. The casting of Michael Douglas and Sean Penn was inspired and the story is compelling to say the least.Nicholas Van Orton (Douglas) receives a strange birthday gift from his brother Conrad (Penn) A game, that's the gift, a game that plunges him into a living nightmare; a conspiracy (or so it appears) Life or death, true or false; The Game poses many questions and is steeped in mystery and tension from the moment it begins.All the questions do get answered by the end, and the surprise ending caps off this thriller excellently.Terrific entertainment 8/10",8,63,74,7 March 2004
Ghostbusters," Brilliant fun and fresh comedy
","Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson are the Ghostbusters, a team of para-psychologists that setup an emergency service for people experiencing problems with irritating transients from the spirit world.The impact of this film is still awesome even now, it's quite simply a great idea that is brought to the big screen by the talented writing of Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. Using wonderful special effects (for the time) and the comic genius of themselves plus Bill Murray, they produced a film that is one of the most memorable comedies in movie history.This film is littered with hilarious gags and funny scenes, that are all housed within the solid and very inventive storyline.8/10 It's great",8,2,3,7 January 2007
Back to the Future Part III," The End of an Era
","Its off to the wild west where Marty has to save Doc Brown from being shot in the back by Biff's ancestor.The film is not as good as the first two, but it is entertaining, and it answers most of the questions raised by the first 2 Movies.All in all the third film is the worst but it ends nicely and it brings Marty Back to the blissful position of not knowing his own future. something we all take for granted.If you've seen the first two, you must see this, just to see how it all ends up, you may be a little disappointed, as some of the magic has worn off, but its still great fun 8/10",8,2,2,16 January 2005
Men in Black II," Still good, just not as good
","This follow up to MIB has a familiar feel to it right from the off, and Jay (Will Smith) must find Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) and refresh his memory before the renegade Kylothian monster disguised as a supermodel (Lara-Flynn Boyle) wipes out the human race.There's plenty of familiar characters and also a few new ones, although the new ones aren't quite good enough to fill the void left by the characters who have been omitted (mainly the original bad guy) although Boyle is definitely sexier lol.Once again the special effects are outstanding and the pairing of Smith and Jones works like a charm.OK it's not quite as funny as the first film and at times it does feel a bit re-created, but it's not at all bad, and it still has the required elements to entertain.6/10",6,6,12,24 January 2007
Rules of Engagement," An OK Movie, if you can ignore the holes
","I Like to enjoy a movie, even if it has flaws, and i don't like to nit-pick as a rule, bit i don't like movies to cheat, and this movie does exactly that.Samuel L Jackson, is a highly decorated and Heroic Marine, that is hung out to dry by the American Government, after a siege in Yemen went bad. Under heavy fire, he loses Marines and orders the hostile crowd outside the US Embassey to be slaughtered. Refusing to let the United States take the fall, they destroy evidence and leave him without a chance.With a cast of Samuel L. Jackson, Guy Pearce and Tommy Lee Jones, all delivering fine performances, and the basis for a good story, this movie is somewhat spoilt by the following - WARNING MAJOR SPOILERSDuring the Siege in Yemen, we see the unarmed crowd, before the order to waste the Mother F*****s. Later in the film we see a flashback through Samuel L Jackson Eyes, where everyone, even the women and children were armed and were firing at the marines. There was no reason for this, other than to try and fool us, the viewing audience that he may have been wrong to fire on the crowd.SPOILERS OVER That Said it is an enjoyable movie, but sadly nothing more.6/10",7,2,4,30 January 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Three of the best performances on film
","Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a boxing trainer whose daughter is painfully estranged from his life. He doesn't take risks with his fighters, he's calculated and protective; leaving him less than successful at his art.Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) is a wannabe boxer, with an remarkable and unshakable focus on success; but her age is against her. Her family are less than supportive of her ambitions, and they are disrespectful to her in-spite of her desire to do the best by them.When Frankie begrudgingly agrees to teach Maggie, they learn to share a common feeling of fulfilment, and find the sense of family that they have both lost, in each other.Morgan Freeman plays an integral part in the story, his is Dunn's helping hand in the gym, while also being his council and his guide; but he is also the narrator of the story, in a very similar manner to the one used in the Shawkshank Redemption.Eastwood's direction is sublime, again he proves his knowledge of what a film needs to truly tell a story and compel an audience. All of the support characters are interesting, sometimes funny, but always well portrayed; the story itself is excellent, it has power and passion, and if it fails to provoke your emotions then i'm afraid you may in fact be dead.What completes this masterpiece is the performances of the leads players - Eastwood is typically brilliant, he's inspiring and impossible to take yours eyes off.Freeman is on top form, he's faultless and plays the voice of reason and rationality throughout the film.And finally Swank, she is simply awesome in this role, her physical ability as a boxer is astounding enough, but when coupled with her exemplary acting talent, she commands the screen in every scene with ease - Awesome Whatever your expecting in this film, it won't fail to move you or impress you; it's a masterpiece 10/10",10,2,4,25 January 2007
Dumb and Dumber," One of Carrey's best Movies
","Madcap crazy comedy from start to finish, Harry and Lloyd are two brilliantly funny characters, both excellently cast and perfectly played out.OK the story is nothing special, but it doesn't need to be. It is merely a carriage for the escapades of the dumb duo. Make no mistake for those of us that simply want a good laugh aloud riotous comedy, this fits the bill.Hilarious, side splitting fun.8/10Avoid the sequel.",8,3,7,20 January 2005
The Evil Dead," Cult Viewing
","The Evil Dead is probably the first movie to shock, scare, haunt and amuse all at the same time. Sam Raimi captures the terror of the Evil Dead in this first outing for Ash (Bruce Campbell). He and 4 other students are taking a vacation in an old cabin in the woods, they unwittingly resurrect some slumbering demons that one by one take possession of the students.Unlike the title suggests, this is not a zombie movie, it is a horror that is both supernatural and evil, but it's also brilliantly funny without taking away the gruesome and creepy feel of the film.The only bad thing in the movie is the quite obvious low budget that Raimi had to work with. Thankfully most people can see past this flaw and appreciate just how good this movie is.8/10",8,3,6,1 January 2007
8 Mile," Not all its cracked up to be.
","So many people have told me that this film is brilliant, that it bridges the gap between rap and poetry, that is has an amazing and compelling story.Well let me start by saying this - a year ago I wouldn't have contemplated watching this film, but in that time I have grown to admire and respect Eminem as a musical artist, the man is a genius at what he does.8 mile does have an interesting story, and I take my hat off to Eminem for his strong performance. The problem I had with the film was this - the rap battles (except for the final one) They were like something seen in the playground at school; I just couldn't take them seriously at all. They just seemed childish and nothing like the cutting edge rapping I had been told was in the film.Not bad, but I don't see what all the fuss is about.6/10",6,1,3,31 December 2006
Shrek 2," Doesn't quite match the first film, but good fun anyway
","Shrek 2 keeps the wining trio of Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy, and it throws in the comic genius of John Cleese and Jennifer Saunders as well. The freshness of the first film has gone, but that is not to say that this sequel is stale, far from it! It still has plenty of new gags and parody's, and it successfully plays on a few 'in jokes' from Shrek's first outing.The only problem i can see here, is this, the magic has worn off a little, (despite the introduction of the fairy god-mother) and it does leave the movie just a shade behind the original.A Good sequel, and i can't wait for Shrek 3, but i suspect it may disappoint (lets hope not) 7/10",7,6,12,1 February 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Fantastic
","Probably Tarantino's most universal movie to date, with a little less character dependency than most of his films and a more linear approach than usual, Kill Bill Volume 1 is a great place to start for anyone new to his movies. I don't mean to imply this is a shallow film (far from it), i simply found it easier on the mind than Tarantino's other movies.Uma Thurman, left for dead by her ex-boyfriend (Bill) doesn't die and begins her quest for vengeance, by hunting down Bill's gang members in a search for Bill. Armed with a Samurai sword and a deadly blend of martial arts skills, Uma delivers action, violence and passion as she plays out the character with beautiful precision.Need i say, this is excellently directed, brilliantly scripted and cast, and should be in everyone's Tarantino collection.10/10 Second only to Pulp Fiction. Although it has wider appeal (I think)",10,125,256,23 January 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," A fine pair of Films
","Beginning with a fine story of two brothers on the run with a kidnap victim in tow, looking for a means to escape and live the high life. After Tarantino's character murders their hostage, they turn to Jacob (Keitel) a faithless priest travelling with his children to help them cross the border. Scared for his children's lives, he help the murderous duo reach the 'Titty Twister' a dodgy bar in Mexico, and that's where film number 2 begins.Very quickly the movie becomes a vampire slasher flick, that is extremely gory and all in all pretty unexpected.The film remains humorous throughout and never quite takes itself seriously enough to be become cheesy and the cast are all on top form throughout.For its originality and high octane entertainment i give this 9/10. its just sheer mindless (and bloody) fun.",9,5,7,21 January 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A Classy and Polished Remake
","Charlie and the chocolate factory is a painless transition for every fan of the original. All of the magic is still here, the script is updated and has been given a Tim Burton makeover, but it still rings true, and happily none of the charm has been lost. In fact the one and only minor disappointment as a big fan of the original is the omission of the UMPA LUMPA song (you all know the one i mean) Gene Wilders eccentric and wonderful portrayal of Willie Wonka has also been surpassed by Johnny Depps truly awesome and inspired character. The blend of humour and sarcasm, lends a new dimension to the film, thank you Johnny for another top notch performance.I can't close this review with mentioning Freddie Highmore's performance as Charlie Bucket, with surprisingly little to say and do, he delivers his lines of sentiment and wisdom with great effect.Overall, this is a great film, that is fun for the whole family.8/10",8,2,4,13 February 2006
Mission: Impossible II," More of an Action Movie than a Spy Thriller
","Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back, and this time John Woo is in the directors chair, which can only mean one thing.Mission Impossible II still keeps some of the spy feel found in the first incarnation, but this time its interlaced with some brilliant action sequences and some original stunts sequences that are great fun to watch. I think what impressed me most about this film was the fight sequence near the end, it really did seem very realistic considering the training and background of the characters involved.To carry the action along, a good storyline is introduced, that is both compelling and clever enough to keep our interest throughout.With a few old faces and the introduction of Thandie Newton and Dougray Scott, the cast is again pretty solid; all in all this second incarnation bears almost no resemblance to the original series, yet it still entertains purely as an action picture with some substance.I found it to be a thrilling ride, and i enjoyed it more than the first film 8/10",8,1,2,13 October 2007
Black Hawk Down," Not a huge fan of the Genre, but a Fine Movie
","As war films go, i have to say i'm not really a fan, but i do like to watch a good movie, and thats what this is.Based around real events, this film and its brilliant cast delivers suspense, drama and action.The entire movie seems to be realistic in its depiction of war, in the same way that Saving Private Ryan is.This is a well made movie, that shows us that errors in war do occur, and that no-one can hide from the horrific repercussions of these errors.An emotionally charged, well made movie 8/10",8,3,5,16 January 2005
Men in Black," Funny, effects laden sci-fi comedy
","Agents Jay (Will Smith) and Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) protect our world, that is crammed full of aliens who live among us, and most of them are respectful citizens of planet Earth, but every race can have a bad apple or two. Smith and Jones make an unlikely pair, but they work in harmony really well here, and it's a pretty funny adventure.Fine special effects help to bring the aliens in MIB to life, and they have as much character as the duo in black, and they get just as many laughs. The film carries a good plot and is entertaining from the opening scene; which sets the tone of the film nicely, and makes you yearn for some more.8/10",8,36,45,23 January 2007
This Is Spinal Tap," Wonderful Rock Satire
","Spinal Tap is a brilliant piece of Rock Music Satire, and here's ten things i love about it.1/ Nigel Tufnel's painfully bad Guitar Solos. (There his trademark) 2/ The bands spontaneously com-busting Drummers (Dozens of people do it, it's just not widely recorded) 3/ The 18 inch Stongehenge Monument that was in danger of being crushed by a Dwarf (Making a big thing of it would have been a good idea) 4/ Not Doing Heavy Metal in Dubly (Dolby of Course) 5/ Nigel Tufnel's Guitar Collection (Don't Touch it, Don't even look at it) 6/ Derek Small's Embarrassing Airport Security Problems (A Cucumber wrapped in Silver foil) 7/ David St. Hubbin's, the patron saint of quality footwear.8/ Nigel's Medically accurate T-Shirt, (It is green, you see how your blood looks Blue) 9/ The Track Big Bottom (Talk about bum cakes, my girls got em) 10/ The Black Album Cover (None more Black, and Metallica Loved it too) 11/ And Finally (These go to Eleven) A Must for Rock Fans, but potentially funny for all.10/10",10,1,5,4 February 2005
The Mummy Returns," A good Sequel
","Rick and Evelyn now married with a son, find themselves amidst the second coming of Imhotep. After their Son Alex is kidnapped by Imhotep as he seeks the Scorpion King (The Rock) Rick and Evelyn must pursue their sons capture, with the aid of the clues Alex leaves along the way.Aside from some unusual revelations in Evelyn and Ricks past, the movie concentrates mainly on the action this time out and runs a little short on story.I Liked the evolution of Evey's character, now she's hardened up she makes a mean adversary, and takes part in some good battles.All in all, i enjoyed the experience and once again the Visuals were more than adequate.If you enjoyed the first, then watch this one, its good fun and has some fine moments.7/10",7,49,61,25 January 2005

","When Woody is stolen by a toy collector, Woody learns his background and discovers he was part of the round up gang, with other toys named Jessie, Stinky Pete and his trusty steed Bullseye, he is all set to become part of very rare toy collection in a museum. But Buzz, Hamm, Rex and Slinky Dog have other ideas, as they mount a rescue of huge proportions.With some hilarious parody's of Star Wars among others, and some funny interventions from other toys in the store, Toy Story 2 spends more time entertaining than character building, and it makes an even better Story for the Toys to play in.Fun for everyone 8/10",8,8,12,5 February 2005
There's Something About Mary," My Favourite Farrelly Brothers Movie
","Ted (Ben Stiller) has a date with the hottest girl in school Mary (Cameron Diaz) but it all goes horribly wrong, and Ted never quite recovers from the experience. Years later He Hires a private detective, Pat Healy (Matt Dillon), to find Mary in hope of a second chance. The Problem is Pat Falls for her too and along with Ted, there's also Tucker and Woogi after the affection of the beautiful Mary.The four of them go to extremes in a fight for Mary, and will do anything to get the girl.Hilariously funny script and characters, this is one of the funniest romantic comedies ever made, and is a fine achievement from the Farrelly Brothers.8/10 There is definitely something about Mary",8,1,2,5 February 2005
Mission: Impossible," Its a Decent Adaptation to the Big Screen
","Tom Cruise Ethan Hunt, a secret agent framed for the deaths of his espionage team, is on the run from government assassins, as he tries to uncover the shocking who's and why's of his setup.Cruise performs well in the role, and the support from Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Jean Reno, Ving Rhames and more is strong and definitely adds plenty of body to the film.With some good intrigue and tension, a few breathtaking stunts and a strong conspiracy style plot; Mission Impossible is a decent adaptation of the original series, without really being too familiar.7/10 but should have been better",7,21,32,13 October 2007
Saw," Well Above My Expectations
","After hearing mixed feedback from reviews and comments made by others who had seen the film, i wasn't expecting too much from SAW. I WAS WRONG! Entirely Dark and Creepy, Saw successfully engages your attention, provides many shocks and scares that are perfectly blended with a strong story.SAW achieves what too many Horror/Serial Killer movies only strive for, Undying Tension and an original plot, where the viewer is fed each revelation and twist at the right time so that the truth unfolds subtly, and the shock effect is maximised.With a budget of around $1 Million and a debut outing for writer/director James Wan, the result is stunning, and i feel this young talent has a great future ahead of him. Even with some fairly weak acting and an occasional low budget feel, Wan has still created one the finest horror/serial killer movies ever. This would equal Seven or Silence of the Lambs if the Cast was of the same calibre.A brilliant Debut, an original Film, and a fantastic achievement. Great work, and i look forward to the sequel.9/10",9,1,2,20 February 2005
The Last Samurai," A really Good Film
","Although not a true depiction of the Samurai warriors, this film is very well made, and the essence of the Samurai remains true. Capt. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is under orders to wipe out the Samurai, but is captured during battle and learns to live along side them and take spiritual fulfilment from their ancient way of life.Some fantastic battle scenes (a little braveheart like in their imagery), strong characters and brilliant direction, result in a thoroughly entertaining movie, that is not what i expected at all.(not even close)If you're looking for all out action, this isn't the right film for you.If you want a spiritually moving insight into what it may have been like to live as a Samurai, and how modern day Japan was born, then that is what you will receive.9/10",9,4,7,23 January 2005
The Hurricane," Denzel is a knockout
","This is the story of a once promising prizefighter called Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, who is unjustly convicted of a brutal crime. During his two decades of incarceration, a group of supporters refused to let the fight end, giving everything to help him fight for freedom.The movie is based on true events as told by Rubin Carter himself, he was released in 1985 but he was never actually exonerated of any crimes, and the debate surrounding his guilt is very easy to access via many websites, so i do treat this film as fiction not fact.Whatever the real truth is, for me it didn't distract me from what is a very powerful and intriguing film; and Denzel Washington is simply fantastic throughout.It is a great film, but it's better to think of it as fiction 7/10",7,2,6,14 January 2007
The Fly," Great Film
","This remake of the 1950's 'B' Movie horror classic concentrates on the character's and the science fiction storyline way more then the horror and it is a great film because of this.Jeff Goldblum stars as a brilliant scientist who is working on a machine that can teleport matter across space, and he invites a young female journalist (Geena Davis) to document the final stages as he tries to perfect it so it can transport living tissue.When he accidentally mixes his own DNA with that of a fly he begins to mutate into something far more vile and disgusting then your average house fly.8/10",8,2,4,4 January 2007

Reservoir Dogs," Primary Tarantino Excellence
","Five Strangers are brought together, to pull off the perfect crime. When everything goes wrong and the crime becomes a bloodbath they realise that one of their numbers is cop, but which one.Tarantino's first Feature film, introduces us to his style, in style. With Great characters and Dialogue, and of course, his now well known characteristic direction, reservoir dogs is a very memorable movie.With plenty of quite disturbing violence, and really solid character building scenes, this is quite simply an unbelievably good debut movie.Check out his other work, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill 1&2 and Jackie Brown, and his writing prowess is on show in True Romance, Natural Born Killers and From Dusk till Dawn.9/10",9,3,6,29 January 2005
Total Recall," One of Arnie's Best
","Total Recall, is a fine film and must rank highly for every Arnie Fan. With more story to chew on than a lot of Arnie flicks, this film is a lot more than your average action movie.Quaid (Schwarzenegger) takes a trip to Recall, where you can have a holiday implanted in your mind, and take a vacation from yourself too. When Quaid asks for holiday on Mars as a Secret agent, he begins a psychotic episode before the trip is implanted, and it turns out he really is a secret agent and he is involved in a major conspiracy and has had his memory erased. Or at least that's how it appears?The great thing about the film is it lets you decide for yourself if it really was a dream, or was Quaid really there?8/10",8,4,7,5 February 2005
Rocky," The Original and best
","Rocky Balboa, a legend in movie history created and portrayed by Sylvester Stallone, is more than just a boxer, he's a very realistic character.In his first outing, he is given a once in a lifetime chance to fight the champion of the world. But Rocky is more than just a boxing movie, it a story of a mans journey through life, when all he's any good at it beating people up, the hardships, the struggles, the romance and the sheer determination of the man are all captured here in this wonderfully made film.Rocky is an awesome 'feel good' movie that shows us that the little guy can make a difference after all.8/10 The whole series is worth watching, although none of them recapture the quality of the original, Warning, they do get progressively worse as the series goes on, and you might want to avoid number 5.",8,1,2,30 January 2005
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's Swan Song
","Cruise and Kidman pay the ultimate respect to Kubrick's final work in 'Eyes Wide Shut' a deeply complex and compelling drama that explores marital mistrust, jealously, sexual tension and the potentially harmful effects of hidden truth between partners.As usual Kubrick's work is subject to mis-comprehension and dismissal by casual viewers that are not prepared to think about the movie they are watching.Eyes wide shut is littered with artistic imagery, dialogue and music score. It is fabulously cast - Cruise and Kidman really put in fine performances that are both emotional and powerful and Kubrick's direction is exceptional for one last time.Vivid, brilliant and unforgettable 8/10",8,4,7,2 January 2007
The Descent," Awesome
","Neil Marshall has created another top class movie, 6 friends get trapped when a caving excursion turns bad and the Descent becomes more than a journey into the depths of a cave system; it becomes a descent in to a world of mistrust and even madness.As they are hunted down by a breed of predators adapted to surviving in the darkness of the caves, their individual characters and friendships are tested to the limit.Marshall creates a very strong sense of tension throughout the movie, and all 6 of the actresses give outstanding performances, in particular 'Shauna MacDonald' and 'Natalie Mendoza' whose characters have their own sense of tension between them right from the start of the film.The Descent really is one of the finest horror movies to come out in years, it is relentlessly creepy, dark and atmospheric, it is very gruesome, but it's way more than just a gore-fest; and it is truly terrifying.9/10 Simply has to be seen",9,4,9,31 December 2006
Inside Man," A Very Intelligent Thriller
","Spike Lee has crafted a very compelling and clever heist thriller, Denzel Washington and Clive Owen are the main leads, and they both deliver top notch performances. Strong support is given by Jodie Foster, Willem Defoe and Christopher Plummer; and it all adds up to create a cracking film.Packed with intrigue and mystery right till the end, Inside Man prevails as one of the better thrillers in recent times, and credit to Spike Lee for the style and originality of the direction; it really does have a fresh feel throughout.Fine Performances from everyone concerned, coupled with a strong story will ensure this film is remembered and enjoyed by most people that have the pleasure to watch it.8/10 and a must for thriller fans",8,3,5,12 October 2007
Pulp Fiction," Still the best Tarantino Movie to date
","This movie was recommended to me by my Sister about a year after its release, it was the first Tarantino movie i had seen, and i have to be honest, it nearly passed me by. You know when you sit down to watch a movie and your minds somewhere else, well that was me the first time, and i could have missed out on a gem.Such was the recommendation from my sister, i actually went and hired it again, i don't think i pieced it all together properly on this viewing either, but i certainly recognised it quality, and quickly added it to my collection, and later bought it again on DVD.The Direction can only be described as Masterful, the Cast is simply perfect and each piece of the intertwining story was brilliantly written and played out. What else can be said, that hasn't been said before. 10/10 Recommended to anyone who likes Tarantino, and to those who don't know his work, start with Kill Bill 1 & 2, then watch this. (This is better but Kill Bill is easier viewing)",10,1,3,28 January 2005
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," A Great British Movie
","Written and directed by Guy Ritchie, he successfully defines his brilliant style in this excellent crime thriller with a difference.The casting is perfect as is the characterisation and very slick dialogue. A combination of action packed, very violent and character building scenes, cleverly blend together to tell the story of crime and deception between multiple gangs all oblivious to one another.Ritchie keeps the complex plot, easy to follow without being too linear in his approach. Masterful direction on this movie just leaves you wanting more of the same.Should be fun most movie lovers 9/10",9,3,5,23 January 2005
The Da Vinci Code," An Enjoyable Work of Fiction
","I thought long and hard before choosing to watch this movie, after such a broadly mixed response from people who had seen it, but i'm glad that i did.The Da Vinci Code is a fairly slow paced mystery that plays with the notion of an alternate Christianity in a thought provoking and compelling way; so many reviews focus too much on defending their own beliefs or picking wholes in the facts surrounding the elements in the movie, but this is just another work of fiction as i understand it; and the clever manipulation of the 'facts' (i use this word very loosely, after all is religion based on facts in the first place?) helped to make the picture more intriguing.I do agree with some comments about the pace of the movie, as i have already said it is definitely slow, but the cast, the dialogue and the direction are good enough to keep the film entertaining and suspenseful throughout.Overall i felt it was a good film, with more than enough intrigue to satisfy anyone who is prepared to think as they watch.8/10",8,2,6,10 October 2007
Titanic," As much a Love story as it is a Disaster movie
","Most Disaster Movies have a love story that plods along amidst the action, but Titanic isn't one of them. The love story between Rose and Jack is very deep and involving, and is simply great to watch. At times it even distracts from the story of Titanic, yes, it's that compelling.The Good news for people who don't want the love story is this, the sinking of the Titanic is one of the best movies sequences in history, it truly does involve you in the horror of the disaster, and makes you realise how awful it must have been to have lived through it, or worse, to have failed to live through it.Many scenes in the film are deeply touching, but one that is imprinted on my mind is where a mother is reading a bedtime story to her children in 3rd class while the Titanic is sinking, the only way she can help them is to let them die peacefully in their sleep.The other wonderful thing about this movie, is the real life shots of Titanic at the bottom of the Ocean, the cinematographic is superb and it helps make it all more real.Worthy of its awards 9/10",9,3,6,5 February 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Good Family Fantasy
","In the first outing for Harry Potter, he learns of his descent from a magical background and enrols at the school of witchcraft and wizardry 'Hogwarts'Largely character building this magical adventure takes Harry and his new friends, Hermione (a very talented young Witch) and Ron (Harry's best friend) on a quest for the Philosopher's stone, a powerful stone wanted by the murderer of Harry's parents (Voldomort)Not having read the books, i can't make any comparisons, but even as a stand alone movie, this makes a fine fantasy adventure, fun for all ages. The characters are great, the scenery is wonderful and there is enough magical enchantment to charm and entertain all of us.8/10",8,2,4,22 January 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The Harry Potter films are just getting stronger and stronger
","With all our favourite characters well established and the actors all truly into their respective roles, Harry's fourth outing, sees some new introductions (Mad-eye Moody is brilliant) and some really interesting story revelations that unfold within the main theme, which is very imaginative and strongly written.The tri-wizard tournament has come to Howarts and one 17 year old entry from each of the three schools is chosen to represent their school, when Harry's name is picked at the age of 14, everyone is left bemused as to how and why this could have happened; but he has to abide by the magical contract and compete along side the other three champions nonetheless.The four champions have to fight dragons, solve the mystery of the black lake and survive the terror of the final task within a huge maze.This outing is definitely the darkest so far, and the truth behind Harry's shock entry into the tournament is nothing short of astounding, the closing scenes are deeply atmospheric and very graphic for a movie that is rated '12 - UK/PG13 - US' 9/10 I'm simply dying to see the next instalment, the magic just keeps getting stronger.",9,1,3,10 January 2007
The Matrix Reloaded," Decent Sequel, and a good bridge for the Trilogy
","Neo has grown stronger, and in retaliation the agents have been upgraded, but are still no match for his skills. Agent Smith is now a rogue program, he himself freed from the control of the Matrix by Neo, and is now controlling human souls and multiplying in numbers, spreading like a virus through the program.The crews of the defending ships of Zion are now searching for the key maker, the man who can unlock the secret to their mission. On their quest they are introduced to may new rogue programs, some of which are pretty cool.With some truly top notch action sequences supported by equally impressive visual effects, this film certainly does not lack action, my favourite (difficult to chose) is probably the chase/Fight sequence with Morpheus fighting agents atop a lorry and Trinity racing the key maker to safety (all one scene). Neo's two main fight scenes are cool (now he has Jedi like powers) but not quite as cool as the chase/Fight sequence. There are more fights but, these three stand out more.All in all this movie concentrates more on the action than the story, it is not neglectful, it just develops the plot a little at a time interlaced with some great action sequences.And i have to say the end is a wonderful cliffhanger, that wets your appetite for the finale.9/10 for keeping the Matrix series alive and kicking.",9,2,4,24 January 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A good follow up to Potters first outing
","With all the Character's in place and the world of Hogwarts so well established in the first movie, we get to concentrate more on the story this time around, and consequently, the story is has a little more substance to it.This time Harry is hearing strange voices around Hogwarts (These scenes are very well done, pretty eerie). Together with his friends he must find the reason for the mysterious Petrification of the residents of Hogwarts. After an Encounter with Aragog (A giant Spider) and a revelation that he is a Parsel Tongue (He can Talk to snakes) leading a lot of the students and Staff to believe Harry himself is causing these disturbances. He Finally Locates the Chamber of Secrets, a supposedly mythical Chamber hidden within the School. It is here he encounters the basilisk (a giant snake) for the final battle (a great scene.)Harrys second adventure is slightly better than his first, and at last we can see his potential.8/10",8,4,7,22 January 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Probably not as good as it could have been, but its fun nonetheless
","Brad Pit and Angelina Jolie are John and Jane Smith, a bored married couple who both have the same secret; they are both assassins working for rival organisations. When their paths cross in the line of duty it brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'Till Death Do Us Part!' Mr. and Mrs Smith definitely doesn't lack sex appeal, Starring two of Hollywoods most sought after love interests, and it doesn't fall short on action or laughs either, but with a similar concept to the likes of 'True Lies' i had very high hopes for this film, and sadly it fell a little short of those expectations; that said, it is still worth watching and does entertain pretty well.7/10",7,0,3,13 October 2007
Die Hard," Up there with the Best
","John McClane is one of the greatest action hero's ever, and in his first outing in Die Hard (1988) he is faced with a bunch of terrorists holding the staff at the Nakatomi building hostage, so they can steal the vast sums of money kept in the high security vault.John is caught up in the mess on a visit to see his wife, and is trapped alone in the building to sort out this mess in true hero style, with little help from anyone, except Sgt. Al Powell; a desk jockey who John builds a friendship with over the radio waves.Bruce Willis was an inspired choice as John McClane, his ready quips and lack of respect for authority are realistically portrayed by Willis, and it all adds up to a terrifically entertaining action flick.Action doesn't get much better than this.8/10",8,4,6,20 January 2005
Love Actually," One of the best romantic comedies ever
","Its totally different to most others in the genre, it stereotypes the clichés and then mocks them beautifully, it explores different types of love, couples, married couples, kinship, business relationships, etc. There's actually eight stories in this film, some cross over, some blend together and some stand alone, but they all play wonderfully; and the humour is consistent from start to finish.Littered with top names, and scripted by the brilliant Richard Curtis -Love Actually breaks the mould of the romantic comedy genre while remaining totally appealing to the fans of the tradition.8/10 Brilliant",8,11,18,21 January 2007
Ice Age," A good addition to the CGI genre
","At the dawn of a new ice age, three mismatched creatures have been thrust together by fate. They stumble upon a human baby and decide that they will take it back to its family, and so begins their journey, where they have to learn to trust and respect each others species if they are to survive and succeed.Ice Age is 20th Century Foxes answer to already well established works from Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks, and i'm happy to say that this film is a strong competitor, although it isn't as good as Shrek, Finding Nemo or the Toy Story films.Ice Age has plenty of funny characters, bags of humour and a nice sprinkle of charm and sentiment, which helps to make it an appealing movie for the whole family.7/10 It's not the greatest, but its definitely worth watching",7,2,3,14 January 2007
Man on Fire," Raw and Gritty
","A burnt out ex-CIA operative, John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is on a path of self destruction after losing faith in humanity. That is until he is hired to protect the young daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a wealthy family in Mexico city. After the girl is kidnapped, Creasey unleashes vengeance against those responsible.The story is nicely paced, it allows us to understand and relate to the bond between Washington and Fanning, which is imperative to really feel Creasey's wrath later in the film, and believe me; once the scene is set the vengeance is powerful and compelling, in a way you won't have seen Washington perform before.Top performances from all the cast, seamless direction, a raw and gritty screenplay; and you've guessed it, you have yourself a top film.9/10",9,6,7,21 January 2007
Army of Darkness," More Action and Comedy, Less Horror
","This time Ash travels back through time, and the evil follows him there (it definitely likes this guy) anyway he has to save everyone from the army of darkness that is on its way to wipe out humanity.Now it depends on what you're after in a movie whether you'll like this one more or less then the prequels; this one has far more action, loads more comedy and superior visuals when compared to the previous films, but it definitely lacks the horror element that made the others so good.Personally i think Raimi did another good job with this film and it still scores a 7/10 for me but for totally different reasons.The original Evil Dead is still my favourite, but this is definitely worthy of your attention.",7,2,5,1 January 2007
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Wow, it's better than the original
","In the third outing for John Mclane (Bruce Willis), he is being used as a puppet by a very sinister and vengeful criminal genius who calls himself Simon (Jeremy Irons) When Mclane is just seconds away from being killed on the streets of Harlem, a local shop owner called Zeus (Samuel L Jackson) intervenes and is then forced to join the game.The pairing of Willis and Jackson is throughly entertaining and it is in this concept that this film surpasses its predecessors, Die Hard with a Vengeance is a high paced, action packed buddy cop movie that simply outclasses most that came before it! Yes it's up there with Lethal Weapon; Mclane and Zeus are every bit as good as Riggs and Murtaugh.Beneath the against the clock action sequences and the laugh out loud comedy from the duo, lies a very believable villain with bags of character and a very sinister desire to both succeed in his plans and reap vengeance on Mclane in the process, for reasons that do become apparent.Die Hard with a Vengeance is an action movie, a comedy, a thriller and an adventure all packaged as one film; it entertains on every level and is definitely one of the best movies of its kind ever made.Excellent cast, excellent plot, excellent gags, excellent direction, excellent script, excellent movie. 9/10 Don't miss this one",9,2,3,31 December 2006
Con Air," Just Quality Fun
","A really good action flick that is better than average.Cameron Poe (Cage) an unjustly in-prisoned Army Ranger, spends the first years of his daughters life behind bars, only to find himself catching a flight to freedom aboard Con Air. In typical hero fashion Poe (unable to leave a man down) has to kill all the bad guys and 'save the f***ing day'.OK so its typical Hollywood gung-ho action, but its great entertainment and really does have some fine characters (Malkovich) undoubtedly steals the show with another excellent performance.Just unplug you mind, turn up the volume, turn out the lights and watch the good guys triumph against all odds in true Hollywood style.Brilliant fun, when you're in the mood.8/10",8,3,6,17 January 2005
The Green Mile," How Wrong I Was!
","I remember buying this movie on DVD shortly after it came out, i didn't fancy it much, given Steven Kings movie history (with the exception of just a few, they are too frequently, little more than average) and at over 3 hours long, i thought it may be a test of endurance; but my wife wanted to see it, so i did as i was told and bought it.How wrong i was! This film is one of the best i have ever seen. The characterisation is sublime, the direction is flawless and the range of emotions this film provokes in you is truly incredible.I won't single out an individual performance as this would discredit the rest of the cast, they are all superb; every one of them.For anyone who hasn't seen this film yet, watch it, i'm sure you will like it. You will empathise with every character, you will detest Percy with a passion, you will respect all the guards except Percy and you will sympathise with John Coffey (like the drink only not spelt the same) You will Laugh, you will cry, you will witness a truly horrific death, and you will almost feel it.TRUST ME, YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS MASTERPIECE10/10",10,2,4,7 March 2004
Jaws," Not a film for a new audience
","Made in the year of my birth, I can remember seeing this when i was very young, and i came away from from it terrified. I would go to bed and wrap myself in my duvet (somehow that made me feel safer - the reason why now escapes me). Only one other film that i saw as a child had this effect on me and that was Alien (i could never get passed the face-hugger leaping on to John Hurt's face). Although i realise how amazing this movie is, and can still thoroughly enjoy watching it (the scene on the boat with Richard Dreyfus, Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw comparing scars is pure genius), i do think that for a new audience it must appear a mystery as to why it was ever considered scary. Even its rating has been lowered for today's youth.To be honest the special effects which seemed so terrifying now look quite comical (The ending, when the shark flops on to the boat and chomps Robert shaw, looks kind of like a giant grey rubber dildo). The story and Cast stand the test of time well, but the truth is, there is nothing here to scare the modern audience.All that said, i can't think of a modern day equivalent thats even close to being as good as this was in its day.Still a classic 9/10",9,7,13,22 January 2005
Hitch," Surprisingly good
","Hitch (Will Smith) is New York's greatest matchmakers, known as the date doctor who guarantee's to get you the girl of your dreams in just three dates, and that's exactly what Albert Brennaman (Kevin James) wants when he gets aspirations of true love with a beautiful heiress, Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta) Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) is a tabloid reporter who is investigating the date doctor, completely oblivious that she is already dating him.Hitch was way above my expectations, the cast are all very believable and easy to identify with, showing genuine emotions and frailties. The story is both interesting and fresh, and the script is hilarious throughout.7/10 Definitely worth a viewing",7,2,4,13 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," It's up there with the best of them!
","Revenge of the Sith is now a classic piece of the saga and it 100% deserves to be recognised as one of the finest.Phantom Menace and Attack of the clones struggled to fully meet the standards set by the original trilogy, that is not to say that they were bad, I was a Star Wars kid and would find it hard to find anything Star Wars bad lol.Where the previous movies struggle a little, Revenge of the Sith doesn't. We have all the right ingredients here and some of the finest battles in the Star Wars universe. We even get to re-capture the darkness that was so evident in Empire Strikes Back!It's not perfect, but I could pick apart any of the Star Wars movies if I didn't treat them as escapism, so I am not going to single out this one!Finally, we have witnessed the birth of Darth Vadar, and it was epic!10/10",10,1,1,9 June 2020
The Terminal," Pleasant Viewing
","Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is stranded in JFK airport after his country is no longer recognised by the U.S Government due to a military fallout.Unable to speak English, Navorski is forced to remain in the airport, without full understanding of why? But as time passes Navorski, learns the truth about his country and has to adapt to life in the airport, with nothing but problems from the head of Security.Spielberg and Hanks combine well to bring this tale to the screen, loosely based around real events, Spielberg uses fast direction and his usual magic to achieve a very pleasant movie, which Entertains and amuses fairly constantly throughout.It is not a great film, but it is worthy of your attention, and can be enjoyed by most.7/10",7,3,6,19 February 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Deserving of its praise
","Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sent to Shawshank prison: For Life. Andy is a very intelligent man, a hot shot banker when he was free, and now he's just a number, at the mercy of Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and his head guard, Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown).Andy is a quiet man, but manages to attract the attention of the sisters (Barely Human Homosexual rapists) led by Bogs (Mark Rolston) and he begins his prison life, desperately fighting his admirers, sometimes he'd win, sometimes he'd lose, but he always stayed quiet.Red (Morgan Freeman) is the man who can get things, and he is Andy's first friend on the inside. We witness Andy's relationships with Red, the Guards, the Warden, the sisters and the rest of the inmates, develop through Morgan Freeman's perspective, but always revolving around Andy. In his time there he successfully wins personal battles, gains favour with the guards and inmates alike, and restructures the rehabilitation of so many with his unwavering persistence and drive.All the members of the cast are more than adequate, but i have to single out Freeman and Robbins. Freeman guides the viewing audience in an informative and subtle manner, and Robbins, in his finest performance ever, gives us hope and wisdom, as he manipulates the powers around him so cleverly, to make life as easy as he can for all his fellow inmates.The Movie is very powerful and moving throughout, and it doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of prison life. And at the end when the climax falls into place, you will be left completely satisfied by its unquestionable brilliance.For those who have not seen this movie, all i can say is watch it.10/10",10,4,8,31 January 2005
The Cannonball Run," Sheer Mad-cap Brilliance
","I remember watching Cannonball run when i was just a child, the opening sequence with the black Lamborghini simply blew me away, and i have loved that car every since. That sequence simply sets the tone for the rest of the film.OK so it's dated now, and probably isn't very appealing to todays generation, but this is the original road movie epic and is crammed full of cheesy gags, road rage, fights, great characters, sexy women, sexy cars, and even the odd super hero (Dun Dun Darr - it's Captain Chaos) Oh i forgot to mention the all star cast - Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise, Farrah Fawcett, Roger Moore, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jnr, Jackie Chan; Oh! Sod it there's too many to name, just watch it and see for yourself.Terrific Fun 7/10",7,2,5,29 December 2006
Scream," Teen Horror flicks don't come much better than this
","Another Wes Craven Horror, that delivers, and it delivers with originality and style.Killing the biggest star in the movie (Drew Barrymore was the biggest when this was made) in the opening sequence showed us all that anyone could be killed in this film, and left the way clear for the killer to reap havoc among the students left at the school.With plenty of tension, horror moments and humour, coupled with a great twist at the end, Scream remains one of the freshest Horror Flicks of modern times.8/10",8,16,18,30 January 2005
Back to the Future Part II," Great Sequel
","A great follow up to an amazing film, this time Marty Travels to the future and the past, and the story unfolds even further.Marty's not the only one changing events anymore, Biffs got other ideas as Marty discovers upon returning to 1985 and finds his world has crumbled around him, His Fathers died and his mother is married to Biff, Doc Brown has been committed. And Oh Yes it was all Marty's fault. That's the trouble with time travel, you mess with it and things go bad.So Doc and Marty need to go back to 1955 and put things right again, only this time they can't interfere with their last trip, great entertainment, crammed with fast paced thrills and comedy.9/10",9,6,9,16 January 2005
Carrie," Dated Horror Classic
","Carrie was Stephen King's first transition to film, and the most successful horror novelist's story didn't disappoint. Sissy Spacek excellently portrays Carrie, a sheltered high school misfit who is ridiculed and tormented by her fellow students because of her innocence and naivety. Little do they realise, they are pushing her to the edge and helping her unleash the power she wields within.Sadly unlike the novel the movie has suffered the test of time, seeing it again now makes me realise how much of the horror is lost in this on screen translation; but i still salute it as a genuine horror classic; i remember how scared i was when i saw it the first time, and it is because of movies like this one that the horror genre has continued to evolve and entertain.7/10",7,3,7,29 December 2006
Shrek," A Wonderful Achievement
","Shrek is a wonderful parody of every fairytale story that you can think of, for the kids it has charm, humour and tons of fun, and is a delightful film for them to enjoy. In addition, Shrek has plenty of subtle innuendo and more adult themes running seamlessly along side the story, much of which may pass younger children by, without spoiling any element of their enjoyment; while at the same time enhancing the enjoyment for the older viewers.Shrek is simply so well created that it can successfully appeal to a huge audience excellently voiced as it is, by Mike Myers, John Lithgow, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy.Brilliant characters, solid script and hilarious parody, make this film a simply wonderful achievement, and that's without mentioning the awesome computer generated world that houses it.9/10",9,73,85,1 February 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," Dark and Gripping Thriller
","Silence of the Lambs was the birthplace of Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter, one of the finest monsters ever screened. Although this is the middle film in the trilogy, it was made first and remains the finest in the set.Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is a highly intelligent, very vulnerable young FBI trainee. With a serial killer named Buffalo Bill increasing his body count. Clarice is sent by Jack Crawford (Scott Glen) to attempt to gain any information that she can from Dr. Hannibal Lecter (A brilliant, yet Insane Psyciatrist known as Hannibal the Cannibal) Starling has to gain Lecter's trust, by engaging in very dangerous mind games with the Doctor, and the last person you want in your head is Hannibal Lecter, but without his help, Buffalo Bill's victims will stand no chance.Foster and Hopkins have a very strong on screen chemistry, and both portray their characters brilliantly, making them realistic and believable. The Scenery matches the mood of the movie, very dark and gloomy for much of the time, and the pockets of suspense interlaced with some imaginative psychological horror make Silence of the Lambs a movie that sets the standard, and the standard is high.10/10",10,13,33,2 February 2005
Any Given Sunday," Not one of Stone's Better Movies
","Three things made me want to watch this film - 1) Al Pacino, and on this score at least i got some satisfaction, he pours everything into the role as Coach Tony D'Amato and his victorious position at the climax to the movie is truly rewarding and is thoroughly deserved.2) Oliver Stone, with movies like JFK and Born on the Forth of July under his belt, your never sure when he'll produce another masterpiece; unfortunately this turns out not to be one of them.3) Many reviews point out that 'no affection for American Football is needed to enjoy this movie' sadly i disagree, that's not to say i didn't like this film, just that i would have definitely enjoyed it more if i was an American football fan. (Please heed this warning, all of you who are not fans of the sport - your enjoyment will be impaired)Overall i found Any Given Sunday to be a decent attempt to explore complex characters, emotions, betrayal and corruption that uses American Football as a carrier for the story, but i found it to be too clichéd to ever become a classic movie.6/10",6,2,3,12 February 2006
Blade Runner," Clearly a Masterpiece
","This masterpiece, is probably the finest Sci-Fi movie ever made, and i can't see a reason for it not to have a place in everyones collection.The story, direction and cast are all perfect, and although i agree that the directors cut is better, i still believe that the original Harrison Ford voice over is pretty good, even if the end of that version was s**t.I first saw the movie when i was about 15 years old, and it blew me away (and yes that was the original cut of the film). At that age without the voice over the film would have been too difficult to follow, so i do have my reasons for liking that version. I also think that the original cut of the movie probably has wider appeal.My advice is this, see the original cut and if you like it watch the directors cut. If you jump straight into the directors cut, and don't give the movie your whole hearted attention, you will miss out on a masterpiece in cinematic history.Original Cut 8/10 Directors Cut 10/10",9,6,11,16 January 2005
Bruce Almighty," Another Carrey Triumph
","Jim Carrey has the power of god bestowed upon him in this hilarious comedy treat and he's on form to entertain in his usual mad-cap and crazy manner.Bruce almighty is not all that dis-similar to the Mask in the way Carrey's character has extraordinary powers at his disposal, and i would say they are about the same level in terms of entertainment too.Bruce Almighty is definitely a must see for Carrey fans, and it is certainly funny enough to tickle even the most miserable of funny bones.If you fancy a laugh, you could do a lot worse than this; pure mindless fun from start to finish.7/10",7,1,3,29 December 2006
Casino Royale," A Contender for the Best Bond Yet!
","Casino Royale takes the Bond Character back to his raw roots, and reflects the image of Bond that Ian Flemming had in the first place.After all the fuss and upset over naming Daniel Craig as Brosnan's successor in the Bond hot seat, i'm happy to say that he is quite simply an inspired choice in the role.Loaded with fast paced action from the start, we get too see James Bond evolve as the movie progresses, he has to learn many lessons in being a '00' agent the hard way; and the film is gritty and raw enough to portray it superbly.Casino Royale is both visually impressive and excellently made, and despite still having a few far fetched moments, it feels like the bond character is reborn. Dare i say its the perfect start to Daniel Craig's reign as Bond, and he proves with just a few very well known words right at the end of the picture, that he will undoubtedly succeed.9/10",9,0,3,12 October 2007
Signs," Hopeful 'Signs' of a long career
","M. Night Shyamalan has once again created a sense of tension that is rarely equalled. Mel Gibson is a great actor and with support from Joaquin Pheonix in a film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, i couldn't wait to see this film.I saw it during its week of release, and didn't expect the kind of frights and tension that we saw in the Sixth Sense, given its (12) Rating, but by the end of the movie, a group of young teenagers sat a few rows in front of me, were genuinely terrified and had spent much of the movie crying. It's not because the film was horrific, it's entirely due to the masterful creation of suspense and frights that Shyamalan has. He seems to be able to bring out the best in his cast, whatever their age, and he can retain the tension of a moment with ease.Believe me, to get the best from this film, turn out the lights, turn up the surround sound system and watch it alone, and if your can't feel the spine tingling terror, than i pity you, because your missing psychological effects of the this fine film.I hope Mr. Shyamalan has a long and successful career, and with films like Signs and Sixth Sense already under his belt, i'm sure he will.9/10",9,4,9,1 February 2005

","There are no Wonderful performances in this film, adequate is more the word, but gladly this doesn't harm the movie.Dennis Hopper has rigged a bus to explode if it slows down, an act of vengeance against Reeves, who had thwarted his previous scheme. From here on in its just pure edge of your seat thrills, it's 116mins long but, i swear it's over in an hour.There's nothing really clever here and there's no real depth to the plot or the characters, but it really is a thrilling ride, that is so easy to enjoy, it would be criminal to miss it.8/10 Avoid the sequel, it's bad; really bad",8,2,4,2 February 2005
Live Free or Die Hard," The Die Hard Series Definitely Lives Free
","I have to confess that when i heard about the future release of a fourth Die Hard Movie i did feel that maybe they were milking the series for a quick buck! All i could hope for was an entertaining action flick at best, i'm happy to say i was way off with my assumption.'Live Free or Die Hard' is an explosive, action packed addition to the series; the stunts are hugely impressive and they come at such a pace, the audience has no time to even catch their breath from one sequence to another. Mixed in with the adrenaline is a pretty compelling plot that unravels at a steady pace, maximising the compulsion to keep viewing; and of course the traditional Die Hard gags are evenly delivered throughout the movie.This movie has all the right ingredients for a great action movie, and even though it does have a few over used clichés in the plot, it still has enough fresh ideas to make stand up to the original.Well done Bruce and Company 8/10",8,1,3,8 October 2007
The Sixth Sense," It's all in the ending
","Cole (Haley Joel Osment) is a young boy troubled by an affliction, he can see the dead all around him, for much of the time and he is labelled a freak by everyone except his mother. Haley Joel Osment puts in such a fine performance in this role, it is hard to believe he is a child.Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is a highly acclaimed child psychologist, who's relationship with his wife is in trouble and his ability in his profession is diminished as a result. A different role for Willis, but he proves he doesn't have to be all action all of the time, with his remarkable performance.Crowe becomes Cole's therapist, and is faced with personal demons from a previous patient of his, a very similar patient to Cole, and Crowe has to figure out how to help him, however horrific the truth is.M. Night Shyamalan both wrote and directed this movie, and he helps provide an Ora that is extremely tense and spine chilling throughout.All in all the movie was very good in every way and would have scored 7 or 8 as a supernatural thriller, but then came the ending, well it's more of a revelation. It is simply wonderful, and you will want to see the film again, to find out exactly how they hid it from you, and the fact is they hid it well and didn't cheat in the slightest.10/10",10,16,19,2 February 2005
Final Destination," Fresh and Compelling Horror Flick
","Alex (Devon Sawa) has a premonition that flight 180 to Paris will explode on take off, he and some of his school colleagues get of the plane and survive the disaster; but death is still in their destiny and it's coming back for them.With a very refreshing and original storyline, Final Destination is simply compulsive viewing from start to finish. It still has many hallmarks from the teen slasher genre, most notable of these is the slightly corny dialogue, but it doesn't distract from the enjoyment too much. The cast is strong, the deaths scenes are shocking and usually unexpected, even if they are a little over-elaborate at times, and the direction is pretty smart and very tight.Overall this film entertains, and it is great fun when all you want to do is relax and watch - no thinking required.8/10",8,1,3,2 January 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The End of the Trilogy and it's good, except the end!
","The first 2 films were very good and not having read the books, i really wanted to see this, everyone seemed to think it was the best of the three movies and I didn't know what was going to happen next.I sat down expecting to be enthralled for another 3 hours, and to be fair i wasn't disappointed, that is until the end, unnecessarily it tainted the entire point to the trilogy.I'm not sure if this happened in the book but, here we go - Frodo reaches Mordor, has a pretty good wrestle with his conscience and with Gollum, and finally throws the ring into the fires of Morder.Great nothing wrong there, so end the film.But no, we then see the world collapse all around poor Frodo, (who's already had a pretty bad time) and he finds himself trapped on a rock surrounded by the fires of Mordor. And there it is, in flies Gandalf on some winged beast and whisks him to safety. What a crock of s**t! Why didn't the sadistic git's who sent poor Frodo on this voyage, just give him one of those winged beasts in the first place and save him a whole boat load of trouble.This ending really tainted the entire illusion for me, and a trilogy that i could have loved, left me feeling a little cheated.For its attempts at greatness i give it 8/10, but it would have 9 or maybe 10/10 if it had ended a few minutes earlier and not contrived to achieve a bigger climax.",8,4,8,23 January 2005

He Lives on an beautiful island, with good friends and a lovely wife; but he longs for more, he longs to leave his life and seek pastures new.

The Matrix," A Visual Feast, with substance
","What is the Matrix? It's a computer program created by the machines that now control our world, used a means to control our minds while we are used as batteries.In the wake of a war between mankind and machines, most humans now live in this computer generated world, and for the few that don't, life is pretty hard, living in the squalid remains of our planet.Keanu Reeves (Neo) a computer hacker is trapped within the Matrix, but he has a dream of something more. Growing suspicion of his surroundings and a belief that his life isn't quite right leads him to the truth, where he is rescued by a handful of freedom fighters lead by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)Does this seem a little mad? It does to me, but the fact remains that throughout our history millions have fought and died for the idea of freedom, so i guess this is human nature to try and attain freedom, regardless of the consequences that may ensue.Once free from the Matrix, Neo is told that he is the one (a little cheesy), he is the one man that can beat the machines, because he can bend the rules of the Matrix and become more powerful than the programs (agents) who control it, they are governed by rules and he isn't (now there's a nice trade off, for living in squalor. If you get bored, just plug in and kick some ass, sounds cool) Using groundbreaking special effects techniques the Matrix takes us to the next level, techniques that we now take for granted and see every day, were born right here.As Neo struggles to believe he is the one, the team continue to pitch battle against the machines in style, as they enter the matrix and fight to bring it down and rise up against mankind's captures.This movie really is cool, the cast is strong, in particular Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss, the script is pretty slick and the idea is good enough to get us thinking (at very least it acts as a vehicle to carry the visual feast that is The Matrix) For its originality, groundbreaking effects and sheer enjoyment i give it 10/10, even though it does have some tiny flaws.",10,26,52,23 January 2005
Casino," Great Movie, but not as good as it's predecessor
","Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci once again star in a Martin Scorsese mob movie, and yes it's a damn good film, but it does fail to live up to the standards set by 'Goodfellas' which used the same combination of talent. I think it's because Casino lacks the stylistic breaking new ground feel of the afore mentioned movie, and this distracts from the overall enjoyment a little.De Niro puts in a Oscar worthy performance, as does Sharon Stone, she was superb in this movie. Joe Pesci once again plays the psychotic hard man with a certain flair for sadistic violence, a role he seems to act with brilliant ease; and of course Scorcese once again directs with his usual brand of genius.If you liked this film, you simply have to see Goodfellas.7/10",7,1,3,29 December 2006

","In 1977, when the Star Destroyer flew in over our heads during the opening sequence, the Star Wars trilogy was born, and the power of the Force was unleashed upon Millions of adoring Fans. George Lucas successfully brought this Epic to life with a blend of Groundbreaking Visuals, breathtaking action sequences and wonderful characters, all held together by the compelling story, that has captivated audiences since its release.Sure Star Wars isn't flawless, the acting is at times a little wooden, the dialogue is slightly cheesy on occasion and Harrison ford struggles to keep a straight face as he utters the famous line 'May the Force be with you', but it is all forgivable, Hell! It's insignificant when you look at the scale of Lucas's achievement.Awesome Bad-Guys, Wonderful Heros, Humour, Action, Effects, Originality, Style, oh! and JEDI's (how cool is that?)

Cube," Low Budget, Does not have to equal Low Quality
","It probably cost about half the budget of this movie, to make the opening sequence, which successfully gets your attention. Once it has your attention it simply refuses to let you go, it is compelling to say the least.The entire cast were pretty much unknown when the film was made (and most still are), but they all gave fine performances throughout. Without the successful casting this film could have easily been a disaster, as it is almost entirely character driven. I'm glad to say that definitely is not the case.Despite the low budget and practically unknown cast, the film manages to be clever, intriguing, thought-provoking and highly enjoyable. sadly, this film is probably a one off, i can't think of another low budget film that has half the impact of this one.8/10 and worth every point",8,268,319,19 January 2005
Apollo 13," A Great Movie
","I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, i was simply compelled to watch it until the end. I already knew how it ended so i was surprised it commanded my attention so intensely.The fact is the characters were all so realistically portrayed and the film was so expertly directed that it was almost as if the Apollo 13 disaster was filmed and that is what i was watching.Now this film is certainly not to everyone's taste, it is quite slow in the build up and the film relies almost entirely on the script and ability of the cast.If you like your disaster films loud and in your face then this is probably not for you, but if you like them realistic (slightly dramatised) then watch it and be astounded.9/10",9,107,121,15 January 2005

They all do a decent job and the action is plentiful; the story is unintelligent, but amusing enough to make this a good family movie without boring the kids or the adults.It isn't as good as X-men or Spiderman, but it's good entertainment nonetheless.6/10",6,3,4,2 January 2007
Jackie Brown," Another Tarantino Triumph
","Tarantino once again writes and directs superbly in this gangster style crime thriller. With half a million dollars in cash as the prize, an air stewardess (Pam Grier) a gun runner (Samuel L Jackson) a bail bondsman (Robert Forster) an ex-con (Robert De Niro) a cop (Michael Keaton) and stoned beach bunny (Brigette Fonda) are all out to con one another and get their hands on the cash.The dialogue is very slick and clever throughout, and although its loaded with vulgarity; it works brilliantly.The characters are very diverse and each one is fascinating to watch, due to the great acting and the strong script.The direction equals all of Tarantino's previous work, and it blends the characters nicely into the story with craft.The story is a great slant on a commonly used theme, with more than enough twists and surprises to keep it stylish and fresh.Compared to Tarantino's other work, there is a noticeable reduction of violence in this movie, but it doesn't have a degenerative impact on the movie as a whole.Overall, Tarantino has done it again, its probably not quite as effective as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but it certainly doesn't fail to entertain for a moment.8/10",8,4,6,15 January 2007
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Monty Python at their best
","In the Realm of King Arthur, the Monty Python team set out on a quest to recruit the best Knights in the kingdom and find the Holy Grail.This is Classic Python Mayhem, where we encounter Killer rabbits, Knights who go Nee! and Horny Nuns who lure the unsuspecting in with there Grail Shaped Beacon.The Cast all give Typically Hilarious Performances, bringing another must see to the Python Loving Audience.If You Like Monty Python, you'll love it, if you don't then stay away.If you've never seen Monty Python before then give it a try, yes it's dated but its still great fun.9/10Also see, The Life Of Brian and The Meaning of Life",9,77,106,22 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," How do you match Star Wars? Make Empire Strikes Back
","When George Lucas made the Empire Strikes Back, he succeeded where so many filmmakers have failed. A Sequel to match the original, and the secret is simple, don't mess with the formula that worked the first time.The Darkest movie in the trilogy, Empire Strikes back is also home one of the finest battles in movie history. The Battle of Hoth is so full of imagination and excitement, it still stands out as one of my favourite action sequences of all time. Empire also introduces us to Yodi, the Jedi Master, who now has to train Luke to take over the fight against the dark side of the force, While Han and Leia try to escape the clutches of the Galactic Empire.Cloud city is the setting for the finale of the movie, another beautifully created scenic world from the mind of the great George Lucas. While Han is tortured and then turned over to Jabba's bounty hunters, Luke Finally has to face Darth Vader and learn the truth behind the power.10/10",10,1,3,3 February 2005
Braveheart," A Cinematic Treat
","All though not 100% factually accurate, Gibsons romantically dramatised version of events is still a breath taking cinematic treat.The build up of the characters is perfectly paced, allowing the audience to be sucked in to the rationality behind the forth coming actions of Wallace and his followers.The action scenes contain digital imagery so seamless that you would not know is was there unless you were made aware. During the epic fight sequences you are propelled into the horror of the melee, and you can picture how savage these battles really were.There is also some light comic relief provided almost entirely through the Irish warrior 'David O'Hara', who really is a great character and i thank O'Hara for his fine performance.The amazing thing about this movie is the climax, incredibly powerful acting and direction from Mel Gibson, means you almost feel Wallace's pain. Your own imagination visualises this scene far better than any special effect ever could.A top film 10/10",10,2,4,16 January 2005
True Romance," Gritty and fulfilling, one of my all time favourite movies!
","With a Stellar cast, slick direction, terrific writing, and a compelling story. True Romance is a masterful telling of the 'boy meets girl, they find a bag of money and go on the run from the bad guys!' story.We've all probably seen movies with similar stories, but i have never seen one done with such grit and style as this one!It is littered with iconic scenes (The scene with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken is my absolute favourite in case you were wondering!)None of the cast put a foot wrong throughout this movie and Miss Arquette is simply adorable as Alabama, easily her best ever role!If you're reading wondering whether to give True Romance a try, stop reading and watch it! You won't regret that you did for one second!10/10",10,0,0,9 June 2020
Gladiator," A Masterpiece
","Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the commander of Rome's armies and preferred choice as the new Emperor of Rome, this is before Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix) murders his father Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) steals the throne for himself and has Maximus's family killed leaving him for dead.Set on avenging the loss of his family and his much loved and respected Emporer, Maximus fights his way to the Colosseum in hope of confronting his sworn enemy Commodus. An epic tale of power and corruption ensues and its very satisfying to witness, the fight scenes are fantastic and contain enough gore to bring realism without going overboard.Truly wonderful performances from Crowe Pheonix and Oliver Reed, bring this Ridley Scott masterpiece to life.Epic story, powerful drama, top movie 10/10",10,5,7,21 January 2005
Contact," An Agnostic Viewpoint
","This movie is well structured, visually effective and extremely well cast, Jodie Foster captures her characters drive and enthusiasm brilliantly. I have seen this movie numerous times and never tire of its entertaining qualities.OK, so the film is probably not as clever as it thinks it is, but it is certainly not shallow or predictable (as suggested in many comments posted here) and YES it is thought provoking (otherwise why have so many people who claim that it isn't, got so much to say about it.) I do however agree that the ending is contrived, it deliberately withholds vital information (18 Hours of Static) to show that Jodie Foster has learnt to have 'Faith', this was unnecessary.Having read many of the reviews here on IMDb the theme of the reviews seems to revolve far too much around the religious undertones and the battle between faith and science too often. Yes, this would seem to be highly relevant, as it is a strong theme throughout the movie, however this alone is probably not a good enough reason to either love or hate this film. For a start most of the arguments are flawed and some are comically inaccurate, (example 1 - Jodie Foster says she can't believe in god, as there is no data to either support of disprove such a belief, Palmer then asks her to prove she loved her Dad.) Now, i ask you, is belief an emotion? No. So how does this comparison have any rational argument against her failure to believe in God? (example 2 - Jodie Foster says that if the message was religious, then it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a big booming voice from the sky, and Palmer states that that's exactly what it was.) So, if a radio signal received from outside our atmosphere, can be interpreted as 'a religious message' does this mean every phone user hears these 'religious messages' all the time? After all these are radio signals that are satellite relayed around the world from outside our atmosphere. Surely, there are better arguments that could have been used.Anyway, all that aside i really enjoyed this film, simply for its entertainment value and its more realistic approach to an alien civilisation and interaction with other lifeforms in the universe.I give it 9/10, even if it is flawed.",9,3,7,18 January 2005
Donnie Darko," Deeply Refreshing
","Donnie Darko is a cinematic treat for all thinking movie Fans. The story is very clever, but is difficult to follow if you don't give it your full attention.Rarely will you see a film as good as Donnie Darko, but i must stress that this film could easily be discarded as rubbish if you are not ready for its complexity and depth.Perfectly cast and with very few (if any) plot holes this is a film that toys with time incredibly effectively.A firm 9/10 If you like the idea but not the execution then try 'The Butterfly Effect' it is inferior to this, but more linear in its approach . 'Frequency' is another worthy of your attention.",9,9,13,20 January 2005
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," All in all a good outing for Indiana and his dad
","Not as good as the first outing, but far better than the second; and this time it's a quest for the Holy Grail with the help of his dad (played typically well by Sean Connery), this is more of the same great action/adventure you've come to expect from Indiana Jones.The introduction of Indy's father gives the character a little more depth and again you will undoubtedly enjoy the ride all the way.Action packed fun for all the family.8/10If you haven't seen the first two then watch them first, if you didn't like the first two then give it a miss. (I know i'm only talking to a minority here)",8,3,5,22 January 2005
Back to the Future," Pure Genius
","Time travel is a difficult subject to cover in a movie, but Spielberg pulled if off with the Back to the Future trilogy.Michael J Fox in his finest role as Marty Mcfly and Christopher Lloyd as Doctor Emmett Brown make an unlikely pair, then again a DeLorean makes an unlikely time machine, so i guess it doesn't matter.OK so there are some plot holes (Marty the youngest Mcfly, dissapearing from the photo last) for example, but the overall impact of the film is so entertaining that bigger plot holes could have been allowed and the film would have been just as good. It's hard say why this movie is so great, or why it still looks as good as it does, even by modern standards (don't forget this is 20 years old) but if it has escaped your viewing then just see it as soon as possible and i'll bet you'll want to see the rest of the trilogy the second you finish watching it.I think it's just entertainment in its purist form.A big 9/10",9,13,17,15 January 2005
Goodfellas," I'm the first to admit that Gangster films are not really my favourite!
","Scorcese's masterpiece, that's probably the best way to describe it; he takes us on a journey through Henry Hill's (Ray Liotta's) life, from boy to man, as he climbs through the ranks of the mobster scene, and Ray Liotta gives the performance of his life. Supported by great characters portrayed perfectly by Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco and the star of the piece Joe Pesci; this movie simply overflows with style, talent and guts.It's incredibly violent and it's brimming with vulgar language, but every bit of it is warranted as a piece of the picture. Now i am the first to admit that i am not a big fan of gangster movies, but i cannot fail to appreciate the magnificence of this excellent film.It's better than Casino (7/10) and it makes the godfather (6/10) look tame by comparison.Goodfellas (9/10) and its genuinely worth it",9,4,8,8 January 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Great follow up to the first outing
","This Story picks up where the first left off, after trying to start over with his girlfriend and after putting his violent past behind him, he manages to escape an attempt on his life from an unknown enemy. Jason Bourne is back and he must unravel the mystery that surrounds his past.With more action than the first movie, The Bourne Supremacy is both intriguing and thrilling, with great fights scenes, car chases and stunts; all of which are realistically carried out.If you enjoyed the first film, this one will definitely not disappoint; it is simply more of the same winning formula and a must see for fans of the first film, or indeed fans of the genre.8/10",8,6,8,27 December 2006
Jurassic Park," A Fine Effort
","Mainly due to the special effects team who really did bring the dinosaurs back to life, this movie is a good way to spend a couple of hours of your time.Although the cast is very good, they are definitely let down a little by the dialogue (it is sometimes cheesy and Jeff Goldblum's character comes off as pretty stupid most of the time.) Thankfully this takes little away from the fun of the movie and it is at times pretty funny.The story and characters build nicely and the direction is superb (athough a little slow for some), plus this movie uses some of the finest cinematography ever seen (just watch the helicopter approach the island again) magnificent.The saving grace for the cheesy script is this; dinosaurs don't speak and they play the lead roles, even if it does take a while to introduce them in all their CGI splendour.I give it 8/10 a fine effort",8,6,11,24 January 2005
Beetlejuice," An Accomplished Tim Burton Movie
","A Great Idea, Good Script, and Wonderful Cast. What more do you need?Answer - TIM BURTON He successfully creates a fantasy world for the living and the dead to share as only he can. This combined with solid performances from the entire cast and of Course Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice, you know your on to a winner.Keaton Brings Beetlejuice to life in this hilarious comedy, as he is called upon to help some ghosts excorisise the living from their home, with unpredicted results.This movie quite simply gets funnier every time you see it, and there is literally nothing else like it, that i have seen.Terrific 8/10",8,3,5,16 January 2005
Dodgeball," Pretty much as funny as they say it is
","When average Joe's gym, run by Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) is under threat of take over by White Goodman (Ben Stiller), La Fleur and his gym members must raise $50,000 to save it. The only way to do it is Dodge Ball, and with the help of a seasoned professional, maybe they have a chance.Great characters, and a hilarious script make dodge ball a Hit, Ben Stiller's and Rip Torn's characters are particularly well written, but none of the characters fail to get a laugh, and there is a good blend of them on show.Definitely worth a look for anyone who fancies a laugh. It's not a classic, but it doesn't fail to entertain with it's slapstick style.7/10",7,36,51,8 February 2005
Evil Dead II," It's kind of a remake, but then again it kind of isn't....Sort of!
","Evil Dead II once again sees Ash (Bruce Campbell) battling the evil demons in a run down cabin in the woods with his teenage friends. Its the centrepiece of the Evil Dead Trilogy and yet it feels a little like a remake of the original, it does follow on from the events of the first film but the similarities between the two are very apparent.Once again there is plenty of horror, gore and chills; but this time there is even more humour than in the first outing, and once again it is a great film.The character of Ash and the direction of Raimi combine well again and this time the effects have improved a little too.7/10 I still prefer the first film, but in truth they are about as good as each other.",7,5,8,1 January 2007
The Island," Really Enjoyable Sci-Fi Thriller
","Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson lead an all-star cast as residents at an isolated, high-tech compound. They have suspicions that things are not quite what they seem and they stage a daring escape to try and uncover the truth in hope of learning what exactly the island is. As they are hunted down in an unfamiliar world they begin to piece the truth together, and have to try and save everyone else that is still trapped in the high-tech facility.McGregor and Johansson have a magnetic on-screen chemistry and the story reveals its secrets at a steady yet exciting pace. It's packed with action, suspense and intrigue, that all adds up to an really entertaining movie.Forget the tiny flaws in the plot and just enjoy it. 8/10",8,1,3,14 January 2007
The Godfather," It's Not Worthy of number 1
","I have just seen it, for the first time. £20 for the first 2 Godfather films and Fight Club on DVD, i figured that's got to be worth it for such acclaimed movies.Strong performances from Pacino, Caan and Duvall do lend realism to the plot, but i have to say i found Brando's mumbled dialogue really annoying (Authentic? - Maybe? Acclaimed?) but still annoying, and i was disappointed to find he still had a part to play in the film, even after the film maker's had him shot.The movie does have some fine moments (the horses head, Pacino's restaurant scene, Sonny's death) all good scenes, but when interlaced with tediously drawn out rubbish (The opening 20mins YAWN, Pacino's entire time spent in hiding, YAWN) I couldn't help but wish for the film to end.At nearly 3 hours long, the movie could have easily been trimmed by a hour and not lost anything, in summary this film has brilliance mixed with tedium and simply doesn't deserve its place in the number 1 spot.I hope part 2 is better, because part 1 has not inspired me to watch it, maybe when i have nothing else to do i will. Thank god Fight Club's a winner.6/10 Watch Goodfellas instead (It makes this film look timid)",6,16,39,19 February 2005
