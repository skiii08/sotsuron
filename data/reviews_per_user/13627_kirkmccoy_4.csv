The Finest Hours," A story reflecting the quiet dignity of real people facing challenging situations
","I just saw The Finest Hours for the third time in a week and I loved it even more the third time around. There are three stories inter-mixed; the townspeople, the tanker crew and the rescue team. In all three stories regular people faced challenges and ultimately tried to do what was right; people growing emotionally while we witnessed their trials. I do want to stress that in each story people came together after debating what to do and pulled together as a team. That is an inspiring message for today's world. We can have our differences but if we want to succeed we have to at some point make a decision as a team and take action. Look how well it turned out for all concerned in this very fine film.The music and sound effects were amazing. I really felt the roller coaster ride across the waves and the strength it took for those aboard the tanker to survive and the rescue crew to get over that bar.Chris Pine is more than a leading man; he is also a wonderful character actor. This was his most appealing role; he was both vulnerable and shy and I could read his every emotion in those astonishing blue eyes. He has the ability to completely morph into his roles.Chris is mesmerizing to watch but a lot of his roles are not particularly likable men and I've seen all of his movies.Eric Bana did seem miscast in his role.I just wish there was some back story on the girlfriend so we know why she was drawn to Bernie. The biggest mystery is why she wasn't at all cold without her coat during a February blizzard. I thought this story held up very well. The actors behaved how real people would in such trying circumstances (no super heroes or macho personalities). I found the rescue operation very exciting. I will see it again at my local movie house and will definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD.P.S.: I saw it in 2D all three times and am glad I did. I think 3D is often a distraction - paying more attention to the visuals than the story.",9,3,9,6 February 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Wow!
","I loved, loved this movie, all 7 times I've seen it in the past week. Finally saw it in 3D today. Forget the 3D. The best part of this movie were the characters. They have all grown so much; they now own the series. For the stats I am 69 years old, a woman who loved the original series and saw the very first episode the very first airing. This movie had so much energy; the music is fantastic, really keeps the adrenaline flowing; the sound effects spectacular; the special effects wonderful. And I can't say enough about Chris Pines' blue eyes.Special kudos to Simon Pegg as Scotty. He was the voice of reason, he was funny, passionate and dramatic in turn. I also can't say enough about Chris Pine as an actor. He had to endure a roller-coaster of emotions and expressed them all exceedingly well. I really think he deserves an academy award nomination. I felt Spock was more like the old Spock in this sequel; strong and wow when he gets mad...! Uhura really was impressive and I love the 3-way dialogue in the shuttle.I do hope the trequel will be all of them pitching in together on some planet to help the beings, discussing ethics, morality and all the things humans are challenged with current day. Enough of the violence (although I loved every minute of it) but Star Trek is about hope and a positive vision for the future using their wits to solve problems, not fists, not super powerful weapons. May they continue to boldly go and hopefully not wait so long for the next installment; I'm too old to wait another 4 years.",10,4,14,25 May 2013
Rise of the Guardians," Visually beautiful, heartwarming characters, and fast paced action fun!
","I went to see this movie the first time because I think Chris Pine is an amazingly versatile actor, even if it was only his voice I was going to hear. I must admit that I did not get the movie at all that first viewing. But I decided to see it again and the second time I absolutely loved everything about it. The characters were warm, delightfully charming and I was able to follow the story better. The message of love, hope, and believing and having faith in the guardians and each other was precious. Jude Law was appropriately scary and yet turned out to be a rather sympathetic bad guy. Jack was both a 'bad boy' ala young Jim Kirk, and sweetly vulnerable and very much someone children and adults can identify with. Pitch and Jack Frost had a lot in common but chose clearly different paths. Anyway, for all those who like me sometimes need to see a movie a second time to 'get it' I hope you will take the time to see this movie again, especially if you didn't have a favorable impression the first time. I'm actually going to see it in 3-D tonight for my 3rd viewing. I am not a fan of 3-D for live films; it's more a distraction than an enhancement of the story experience, but I think since the movie is visually stunning that I will enjoy the 3-D in this one. I hope this movie wins lots of awards. Happy Holiday Season everyone.",10,0,1,15 December 2012
Wonder Woman," 8 times a winner
","Spoiler Alert! It is July 5, 2017. Although I can't imagine that anyone who has wanted to see this film hasn't already.No movie is perfect but Wonder Woman 2017 comes very close. Visually it is stunning; costumes and scenery. The music is amazing. Wonder Woman's theme is pure adrenaline rush and used sparingly, which makes it more satisfying when it plays. The fight sequence with the Amazon women on the beach was breathtaking to watch; graceful, forceful, and artistic. It was so exciting to see them riding their horses in defense of Diana. The slow motion sequences were a great touch.There was human comedy, laughter, anguish, pain and rage and it was all done realistically; nothing forced.Ultimately, this was a love story; non-traditional but love it was. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine exuded delicious chemistry; their dialogue was of two beings from two different worlds learning about each other. It was genuine and respectful and touching. Their banter was hilarious at times. They were both morally strong beings who cared about others. They tried to understand each other's perspectives but followed their own sense of doing what was right.There were many favorite moments for me but there were two that really stood out. The first was in the battle with the Germans when she turned and yelled 'Steve, let's go.' The second was in the town when he called to her 'Diana; shield.' They counted on each other. I loved that Steve accepted that she was stronger than he was without feeling threatened. He was, after all, brave in his own very human way. Chris was vulnerable, warm, and charming. I think this was his most appealing role.Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman in her statuesque figure and personality. She was so refreshing; she too was vulnerable, innocent at times but determined to fulfill her role as an Amazon, not realizing that she was in fact a god. She was kind and loving to all the humans she met through Steve. She was amazing in battle; loved her twisting around sweeping her foes off their feet. In the end when she went from grief to rage I felt it all. I did see the movie 8 times and this scene was one of the reasons why.Steve was so genuine and touching in his final scene with Diana. The gentle way he said 'I wish we had more time' and 'I love you' was emotionally heartbreaking and satisfying. Now for the hard part; the sequel Wonder Woman movie. I want to see Gal Gadot again in her own movie; I am not partial to the testosterone filled movies she appears in with the super heroes who are so filled with anger and antagonism even with each other. I, of course, would love for there to be a way Chris Pine could come back as perhaps a son or grandson of Steve Trevor (with the same name). But here's the problem. He would not be the same person with the same background and experiences as the original Steve. And Wonder Woman would have matured as she has now lived among men for years. She would have outgrown him. I would not want to ruin the love story they shared in this film by trying to force a 2nd story. He touched her by being human, not perfect, but loving and hopeful that she would save mankind as he gave up his own life so humans could continue to survive.As a feminist from the 1960s this movie appealed to me on many levels. Most of all the message was about the choice to love or hate. She made the right choice. May she live long and prosper. Maybe she'll meet up with Captain Kirk; after all she is immortal and there are many worlds to explore.",9,6,14,5 July 2017
