Ali," Will Smith Great, movie just ordinary.
","Will Smith portrayed Ali almost perfectly! And I believe he deserves and Oscar or at the most a nomination.  However, the story even though at times had its movements, but was most of the time was just lame and ordinary.  I think this is an just above average movie.",6,0,0,26 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 3-hour epic turns out to be a dud
","Boring is the `key' word to use in this film.  God, was it ever boring, especially near the end.   The thing I wished the director did was to edit lots of the unnecessary emotional parts of the film (i.e. death of Boromir) so it could have been shorten to 2.25-2.5 hours.  So, at least my short attention span would have been kept intact.  I have not read the book, so I cannot comment on the book to movie transfer. However I do agree with the comments made by Tolkien's son about the movie, when he said, `his father if alive would NOT have been impressed'.   A little advice, if you like me, and have no liking for fantasy type movies (by that I mean, movies that have elves, dwarfs, humans) avoid this movie at ALL costs.  I gave this movie a 2 (an extra 1 just cause the special effects were kinda cool!)",2,1,2,22 December 2001
Black Hawk Down," War's Futility and Carnage
","War is bad. Everyone knows that.  This movies tells us why!  The ugliness that is war, is beautiful depicted by the marines who battle the Somalis. I have to warn you, before you go see this movie that it is not a very easy movie to see, and some of the scenes can be gruesome.  The lady next to me, had to go outside several times...because she just could not stand the site of the bleeding and death.  I think this episode in Somalia is subtlety telling us the situation that marines would/are facing in Afghanistan.Overall, I gave the movie a 9 not 10, because I think the Somalis were depicted like mad men, which is not true (American war movies have the tendencies of just focusing on their sides). No wonder that the Somalis who live in American protested this movie.  However, other than this fact, it is really an unbelievable movie.",9,0,0,22 January 2002
Am√©lie," Wish I knew french
","um...wish I new more french, because I didnt get the whole story (well the finer details of it) However, it is still darn good...make sure you watch this one and Lagaan (the other internation movie nominated for an Oscar)...make you wonder what is wrong with Hollywood....all the good movies (with good plot lines) are international",8,0,1,23 February 2002
Hart's War," too much American symbolism
","Entertaining movie in the first half (good action, good story transition), however in the second half it falls apart.  Well, I think the movie becomes to symbolic in the end.  By that I mean, there is too many obvious and utterly predictable sequences.  It reminded me too much of another similar patriotic movie I saw in the fall -The Last Castle (starring Robert Redford).  Its not $12 movie, but definitely a rental.",6,1,1,16 February 2002
