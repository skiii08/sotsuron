The Devil's Advocate," Extremely Well Crafted
","First, I must be honest.  I have seen an edited version of the movie (am waiting to see it uncut), so perhaps I wasn't distracted by any 'excessive' nudity or gore....This is one of Pacino's best performances.  The nuances of expression and voice inflection he uses to create this attractive/repulsive diabolical character show clearly that he is at the top of his craft.  Keanu Reeves is also very good, and the majority of the performances seem to fit the bill nicely.What makes the movie stand out is the focus on TEMPTATION rather than total evil.  John Milton (Pacino's character ....hmmmm...'Paradise Lost'...get it?) presents a series of temptations any of us might fall for, before recognizing the evil behind the promises.  The writing includes many intricately developed pokes at the standard 'Goodness of God, Evil of the Devil' arguments we all know.The only weakness in the film, that I could see, lies in its ending....or does it?  After watching the turns and twists of the plot, one is left with a bit of a 'what really happened' at the end....and an understanding that temptation takes many paths.  I gave it a 9, and would highly recommend it.",9,0,0,10 April 2000
Minority Report," Great concept, great potential, poor execution!
","What a tremendous potential this film has....The first hour is dazzling high tech, fast action with almost a 'John Woo on speed' character.  The plot is well developed and engrossing.  So, what happened?For the remainder of the film the pacing is terrible (bursts of action moving the story along followed by long periods of...well...sluggish navel gazing).  It's as if Spielberg has NO idea what kind of a film he is making.I understand the problem, as Philip K. Dick stories tend toward the futuristic high tech combined with film noire.  But Spielberg doesn't combine them...he just makes two different movies and shows us one during the first hour, with the second movie making up the remainder of the film.It's worth watching, and even paying for...but don't expect anything great. Just enjoy the action in the first half, and then head for the snack bar for a pot of popcorn somewhere in the middle.(6 out of 10)",6,0,0,23 June 2002
Pitch Black," Very Unique!
","NO longwinded review / critique.  I wasn't sure this wouldn't be yet another 'monster' sci-fi movie in another environment.  WRONG!  The characterizations, subplots and storyline are all first rate.  The acting varies from terriffic (Diesel) to passable (Hauser).  This is a great roller coaster ride.  Enjoy!",8,0,0,11 October 2001
Dark City," New meaning to 'film noir'
",Imagine an entire world where 'Film Noir' is a way of life. This intriguing mix of 1940's detective thriller and science fiction catches the spirit of the dark cult film almost perfectly.,9,0,1,2 November 1998
The Piano," Well.....nice photography...
","OK....critics seem to have loved this.  It's a fascinating story, beautifully photographed, but directed with all of the subtlety of a small blowtorch.The characters are fascinating, but we are left searching for something to connect the heavy-handed symbolism with the story.  This film has it all, erotism, music, unrequited love, jealousy, bitterness, sadness.....and a totally selfish 'heroine' with a bratty daughter to match.Sam Neill beautifully plays the long-suffering 'husband' of the new bride. She loves everything he can provide, and gives him nothing, not even civility, in return.  She does, however, fall in love with the neighbor (after being carefully manipulated by the delightfully dark character of Harvey Keitel).The problem is: when it all comes to a head, we are asked to believe that the husband, who has never shown ANYTHING other than a kind, gentle and patient side, instantly rebels with an act of unspeakable and unconscionable violence against the wife.  The action was inconsistent with the character, the situation, and ultimately came off as little more than heavy handed propagandizing about the ultimate evil of men.Gave it a 6, as I was feeling generous.",6,10,21,24 January 2000
Major League," Why do I love this film?
","Beats me! All I know is that virtually EVERY time this flick hits cable...I watch it. There is something about the way this simple, very funny movie fits together that just compels me.  Sheen is great as 'Wild Thing' Ricky Vaughn.  And the same can be said for every other actor (and character) in the film.  They all just seem to click.  Bob Uecker is priceless.  I don't know, maybe I'm losing my taste, but this is a film that will ALWAYS pick me up and makes life just a bit better!",9,0,4,28 March 2001
