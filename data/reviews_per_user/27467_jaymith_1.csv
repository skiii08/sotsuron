Iron Man 3," Not up to the expectations
","I was waiting for this movie for a long time and also could not wait for the first day first show. Watched, enjoyed but not fully satisfied. Well, I must say I was expecting more. Though the first two movies were awesome, this one could not compete with the former. But if we are not going to compare this one with the other two parts (obviously our expectations are sky-high), it is quite a good movie, where I might have changed my rating from 7 to 8. Although I believe Director Shane did his part good enough, but there were flaws. Robert is brilliant as usual. So, guys I suggest you to go for this movie, but try not to compare with the other two parts.",7,11,22,27 April 2013
