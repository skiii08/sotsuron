Scarface," Common Sense!
","To all those people who have no brains, that know nothing about struggle and how to look past the situation of the movie, why even bother commenting? Scarface is a classic crime story of struggle and power!If you dont like Scarface then move on back to your love movies with no realistic plot to learn from. Yea, everyone understands what Tony (Al Pacino) was doing in the movie was wrong but so what! Its a movie and its a lesson of strength and wisdom to strive for inner power.  Scarface is a REAL gangster classic and so what if its not listed on THE ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES crap list! Everyone who has a mind that can be reached out through a realistic story(which it is, trust me) loves it! Al Pacino played the part of a Latino excellently (coming from a Spanish person's perspective) and Scarface had an extremely captivating plot. So for those who said 'THIN PLOT'  HAHA Boy you know NOTHING about a TRUE Gangster, cutting edge film!",Null,0,0,5 March 2002
