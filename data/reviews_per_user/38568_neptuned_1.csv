Angels & Demons," Horrible
","I am so sick of being pandered to, the wonderful complexities of the book have been left out completely from this 'retelling'. The questions of science and religion are gone, the relationship between the characters are gone, all the interesting facts and behavioral rules for the characters are gone, even the relationships between the main characters including the father/child storyline is gone.I have read about other shows that were rewritten as the executives thought the stories were too complex, give people some credit! The average person who will see this movie obviously enjoyed the complexity of the book as I would hazard a guess that they read it themselves! The book already had a winning formula, why in the world did they choose to throw that away? Why can we not allow the story to teach about Vatican protocol, why can we not describe the history of the locations that are being visited in greater depth than a quick line shot out of Langdon's mouth about Bernini's sculptures (and a few very quick references to locals).It seems such a shame that films have to play to such a low expectation of education and enlightenment, and that is a true tragedy.",1,13,22,19 September 2009
