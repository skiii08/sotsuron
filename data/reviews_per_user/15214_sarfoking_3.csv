Casablanca," 'Round up the usual suspects'
","Casablanca is a true masterpiece! I was not captivated as it started, but the moment Ingrid Bergman graced the screen, everything fell into place, and I begun to enjoy every moment of it!",9,0,0,24 March 2020
Midnight in Paris," Sidney Bechet: Si tu vois ma m√®re
","Midnight in Paris is yet another classic film by Woody Allen. It is a romantic comedy about a couple (Owen Wilson as Gil, and Rachel McAdams as Inez) who go for a family vacation in Paris, and the twist and turns of Gil's subconscious in a fantasy world filled with all his muse as a writer. The screenplay of this movie is top-notch. It was not surprising this film won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.
The screenplay solidifies the writing prowess of Woody.
Owen Wilson was perfect for the role with all his poetic 'bubbling', and there was such great chemistry between him and Rachel McAdams. The ensemble cast was marvelous, and immensely contributed to the beauty of this film. The score and soundtrack captured the mood and scenes perfectly, producing a positive synergistic effect.
I think this film serves as a tribute to veteran writers like; Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein etc.
Paris as a city is literally everyone's dream city to visit or stay, and Woody does a phenomenal job letting the audience experience midnight in Paris. Midnight in Paris, is not just a great film, but a true masterpiece.",9,0,0,25 December 2019
The Social Network," THIS IS PURE ART
","Wow, just wow! I was in complete awe after seeing this film, so I decided to scribble something to honour this beautiful picture! The Social Network is an outstanding film because of its TOP NOTCH SCREENPLAY, brilliant performances by the actors, and a masterclass direction by David Fincher. Usually I don't pay attention to scores when watching a movie, but this film's incredible score was able to grab my attention. The alchemy between Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield was very natural, which was one of the highlights of the film. This film was an emotional rollercoaster of which I enjoyed every bit of it...Thank you David Fincher!!!! THIS IS PURE ART!!!",10,0,1,23 March 2020
