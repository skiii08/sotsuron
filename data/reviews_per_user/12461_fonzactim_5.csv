Catch Me If You Can," Fun
","I've found that I like to wait for a few days to let a movie settle in my mind before I vote because my first reaction usually changes but, in this case I just must put something down. This movie is FUN! This movie was worth 8 bucks. This was a great story that kept me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait to see it again. I was unsure of Leo before going in but the man pulled it off. Tom Hanks was a wonderful character and the movie got a health round of applause at the end which I rarely see. Go see it and have a great time.",10,0,0,26 December 2002
Taxi Driver," Stupid Movie
","Why was this movie listed in the top 100? At this moment, I can't recall the last time I saw a movie worse than this one.The performances were all good performances, that is true. Unfortunately, the story they were in was stupid. I kept waiting for the end so that all the meaningless drivel of the previous hour and 1/2 would come together and bring some sense and meaning to the endless, pointless, non-existent story thus far. Never came. The ending was even worse, unbelievable and completely un-realistic. I watched this with 2 other people. They agreed this was a stupid movie too! SPARE YOURSELF! DONT WASTE 2 HOURS OF TIME WITH THIS CRAP. Walk your dog, have a nice meal, watch ANYTHING else and you'll have a more enjoyable and interesting time.",1,42,103,9 September 2002
Lost in Translation," Excellent
","I saw this movie last week and haven't quit thinking about it since. I think that this is probably not going to be a movie for most people under 30 right off the top and it's just not going to be interesting to people who like a quick thrill or an easy story. It is a an extremely thoughtful, mature, smart and beautiful movie for the rest that have the time.It's about two people in a foreign country. They don't understand the people around them and vice versa. They no longer understand their mates and vice versa and maybe they've even lost understanding of their own lives. For just a little while they connect with each other and rejuvenate themselves. Call it love, connection, soul mates, understanding, whatever...it's real and it's good and it's only for one week.It's really quite stunning, at times it's hilarious and eventually there's a little bit of bittersweet heartbreak. Bill Murray was not the Bill Murray I know from years past. He was even better in this mature roll. I'm still amazed. Wow. Loved it. Fantastic...",10,0,0,3 October 2003
Signs," Oh yeah...good stuff.
","Don't listen to the critics that bash this movie. It's good. It's real good. I rate movies based on whether I felt I wasted my time and this was a fine hour and 1/2. Definitely, worth the ride. It isn't gonna change your life but it isn't meant to. It's just a good suspenseful fun time. Being that I've seen so many 'realistic' sad endings lately, I was thrilled to walk away with something lighter with more imagination.",10,1,3,8 August 2002
Identity," Cool in the way of Memento
","I thought this was a great 'whodunit' movie. I didn't know all through what was going to happen, why or who. The movie was almost as good as Memento (which I loved) because it has so many twists and turns. I saw this about a week ago and I'm still chuckling to myself a bit about how interesting this story was. I paid over $10 to see it at a hotel I was staying at and it was well worth it in my opinion.",10,2,3,24 July 2003
