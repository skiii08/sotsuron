The Legend of Bagger Vance," Too shmoozy to be good.
",Although the premise of the movie was ok it was too folksy to really get its point across.  Will Smith was just too too ... the words escape me.  The romance between the two main characters was hokey and forced.  The only really redeeming feature was the young boy.  I think he did a good job.  An ok movie for a boring Saturday night at home but definitely not worth the usual price of admission.,6,0,1,17 November 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Absolutely amazing - but not in a good way!
",Unbelievable.  How many bad guys are that bad at shooting.  I think they could stand two feet in front of Tom Cruise with an armored tank and miss him.  I love an action movie... but come on - maybe a tiny bit of believability.  And the worst part - those stupid face changes.  Not worth the price of admission.,2,0,0,17 November 2000
