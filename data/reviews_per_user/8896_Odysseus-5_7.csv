The Blair Witch Project," This film you'll either love or hate...
","and it all comes down to just what your expectations are.In all horror films that work, there are really only two mechanics that grab the viewers and give them the shakes.  The first is the contemplation of some idea or concept that is truly horrifying.  This is very rarely the case in films, as most films cannot convey complex concepts and ideas that well. Some films that deal with the possibilities of disasters and 'aftermath' films try.  Films like _The Andromeda Strain_ come to mind - although obstensibly a sci-fi film, the premise of this film when I saw it first years ago really gave me the chills.Then, more often, there are films that give you a vicarious scare by letting you imagine yourself in a dangerous or terrifying situation.  This is a lot easier to do, of course, and so most horror films fall into this 'suspense-thriller' pattern.  I like the former better, but this - if done well - can still scare pretty good, and can still make for a great film._The Blair Witch Project_ does both.  And the ONLY reason it works at all is because it does use both elements - one by itself given this film just won't work, and if you 'don't get it' - if either part goes over your head - you're just going to be confused by this film.  I think that is why so many people don't like it.But if you can grasp onto the supernatural horror of this film, and if the 'ultra-realistic' way it was filmed can help let you put yourself into the film (like it did for me) then this film is VERY creepy and will keep you awake listening to those little bumps in the night for a good long time. Only one thing though - do NOT see this on the big screen, because you'll be too distracted by the feeling in your stomach at the 'bad' camerawork. Besides, the better setting is in a nice dark room... or tent... at night... lost... in the woods... :-)  Enjoy.",Null,0,1,28 June 2000
Blade," Better than expected!
","Normally, I approach comic translations warely - they tend to be rather hokey and predictable, and this was no real exception.  That being the case, this film was an awful lot of fun to watch, despite predictability and 2-dimensional acting.  The action scenes were better than most of this genre' and the plotline made more sense than most other comic-movies.  Snipes proved himself to be a consummate action-figure star once more in this film. The only disappointment I had with this film was it's en-masse treatment of most of the vampiric characters... but that's more a problem with my enthusiasm with real horror films than with this production in particular. This is not a real horror film, and horror film fans will be disappointed - but if you want a hell of an action ride, see this film!",7,0,1,9 September 1998
Chicken Run," One of the most fun films I've seen!
","Perhaps I'm biased.  I lived in Yorkshire for some years, so perhaps that may give me a little better understanding of the humor than most Americans will have (not to mention a slightly better grasp on the accents, though they were pretty clear).  And I have been a fan of the Wallace and Grommit work for some time - I think EVERYONE should see 'A Close Shave' unless they've had their sense of humor surgically removed.Perhaps I'm biased, but I don't think so, as the entire theater was laughing as hard as I was.  This film is just tremendous, and I have a feeling that Mel Gibson's _The Patriot_ is going to have some of the hardest competition in his other film, _Chicken Run_.Whether you have kids or not, see this film!  Of course the slapstick and animation will appeal to them, but there is enough sophisticated comedy and appeal to this film that anyone can enjoy it.  And to the perceptive who have watched all the 'serious' great escape films, (and to the perceptive who just love Brit comedy) there are many subtle stabs.This is the best 'film for everyone' that I've seen in a long time.",10,0,0,2 July 2000
Alien," This is the benchmark space horror film!
","I can't believe there is anyone who hasn't seen this film at least once. Still, I come back to it again and again, and again and again it gets me leaping out of my seat!  The story is downright terrifying (and, unlike a lot of sci-fi, absolutely believable), the acting very strong, the suspense incredible, the filming excellent - and the setting and monster straight out of the worst nightmare anyone ever had!  Tread carefully when you walk away from this film... you never know what may be following you!",10,1,2,9 September 1998
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Astonishing!
","Can it be?Yes!This is an excellent beginning to the Lord of the Rings trilogy!  While there were slight story changes and some of the images are not what I've always imagined while reading the book, it is obvious that Peter Jackson has done an amazing job of capturing Middle Earth and putting it on-screen.If there is one fault that I find with the film, it is that it glosses over elements that I thought were important in the story.  This I can forgive - if they had done the film the way I really would have liked to see it, it'd be six or so hours long!While the settings all shine in their own way, it seems obvious to me that the best attention was paid to Moria, which is so impressive it is a star of the film in its own right.  The feel of overwhelming gloom and ruinous splendor that hangs about Khazad-dum is both expansive and claustrophobic at once, with this being broken only at Balin's tomb.  The battle in Balin's tomb is astonishingly well done, and the pursuit to the Bridge of Durin shows the orcs as being, if possible, even more sinister and fearsome than I had imagined in the book.  The orcs of Moria resemble nothing so much as humanoid spiders in the deeps.As far as the Balrog is concerned, well... Lets just say that if I had to imagine a 'Demon of Might' - this would be it!Perhaps nothing is more striking in the film than being able to see through Frodo's view with the ring on.  You can understand now that the ring does not just make you invisible... when the bearer wears it, it is as though he has entered another reality that overlays our own.  It neatly works with Tolkien's own description of the 'existance' of the Nazgul.All in all, an amazing translation, and well worth seeing!  A few omissions and changes do not detract from this film's viewability at all - go and see it NOW!",9,0,0,24 December 2001
Event Horizon," Hey - I liked it!
","Finally!  A film that is more than just a splatterfest in space!  I think fans of classic horror (I'm thinking _The Haunting_ and other such) will enjoy this production.  It is a well-cast, solid, and intriguing haunted-house (or should that be spacecraft?) tale with an engaging plot where, refreshingly, most of the true horror occurs in the minds of the characters, rather than in the blood-soaked machete' of some mute killing machine or some wise-cracking psychopath.  I was a little let-down by the fact that they had to turn Sam Neill's character into the more-or-less typical antagonist, but otherwise, a solid horror film that will leave you thinking!",8,0,1,9 September 1998
Contact," Fine film!
","In fact, this may be one of the best sci-fi films of all time.  I gave it an '8' - and it only narrowly avoided a higher rating by virtue of its ending, which I thought was a little weak and predictable, given the rest of this fantastic tale.  However, the acting and the story was incredible, as were the effects!  Someone here said, I believe, 2001 for the 90's and they may very well be right, though _Contact_ does not quite match that film in my humble opinion.  Still, this is a must-see for any sci-fi film fan!",8,0,2,9 September 1998
