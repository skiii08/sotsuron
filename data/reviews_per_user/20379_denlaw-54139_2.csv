10 Cloverfield Lane," Speaking of Games...
","Cheated again. Shame on you Mr Abrams, and shame on me for allowing myself to be hoodwinked again. I won't go into the intricacies of the narrative, the performances, etc.; all of that has been elaborated upon by many, many others. I will say this to sum up my feelings on the film with this analogy: The experience was like being invited to a friend's house for an exciting new board game. The friend shows you the game and it's components, explains the rules, and it sounds awesome. And it is, but only until the game draws to a close...it all comes down to the final turn...anyone can win, and it doesn't matter who wins because it has been such a fun experience. But then, your friend suddenly and unexpectedly wins and then he informs you that the whole game was a scam. The game was fixed from the start; no one else playing the game was ever going to win. Your 'friend' is a manipulative cheater, and you've been had. That is how I felt at the conclusion of this film; not only had my time been lost, but I had been ripped off as well.
I really wish I had played a board game instead of watching this movie.",1,2,5,20 October 2019

","Overwrought & over-promoted. I was at a convention panel several years ago that featured Mr Peele as one of the guests. Overall, it was a lively and intelligent discussion, but one of the things that stuck with me afterwards was Jordan Peele's relentless self-aggrandizement as the next great horror director; I believe he even went as far as referring to himself as 'the black Alfred Hitchcock' (not that I personally ever saw Hitchcock as a horror film maker; suspense, crime, and thriller yes, but not horror). So now, with this narrative mess of a film, Peele has two horror films to in his credentials; neither of which are particularly original or frightening.I see that he has his fanatics and devoted adherents, but ego and self-promotion are not substitutes for talent. Mr Peele has demonstrated that he is an excellent comedian and is a reasonably knowledgeable horror fan, but he is light years distant from having himself or his films being included in the lists of the creators and creations of the Greats of Horror.",2,5,6,21 June 2020
