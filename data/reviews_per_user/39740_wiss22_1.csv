The Longest Yard," waste of my time
","I thought this movie sucked.I'm a Sandler fan, too, and not just The Wedding Singer. I enjoyed Billy Madison, The Waterboy, etc. I think the acting was fine, but the movie just couldn't decide what it wanted to be. Injecting comedy right after a main character gets roasted alive - not funny, but rather completely out of place. That's how the whole movie felt. Out of place. Either you're a comedy or a prison movie or a sports movie. Sure, you can combine those elements, but make sure it flows. It just felt so laborious. There may have been one laugh-out-loud moment, but it no way saved the movie from being a pile of dung.",3,0,1,5 January 2006
