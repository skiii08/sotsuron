Marie Antoinette," Self indulgently inept to the point of self parody
","One of the worst movies of all time. What the hell was Coppola thinking? Her artistic license should be suspended, if not revoked...So about the film- It's a disaster. From the black credits which metaphorically convey the total absence of virtue to be found in this turkey to the anticlimactic ending (Spoiler: we don't get to see Marie Antoinette put to death, which by the first hour was all I had to look forward to) this thing reeks. Hmm... A period piece in which the sets and costumes look sort of versailles-ish, (including Versailles itself) but the mannerisms, plot, and dialogue (not to mention the atrocious mix of bizarre accents) all seem strangely disjointed in time, space... and meaning. Hmm. There's a sort of New Wave soundtrack and title fonts, apropos of nothing. Hmm. Manolo Blahnik shoes. Hmm. And for all you reviewers who said this film is 'beautiful'- You probably think that a cheap grocery store wedding cake is delicious, too. This film is the visual equivalent of that cheap, overly-frosted and -decorated cake: yes, there are plenty of sugary pastel details, but that doesn't make for quality, in film or pastry. And the performances- Dunst is alright until she moves or, worse yet, speaks. Her finest work is clearly in the tent towards the beginning of the film, during her transition from Austria to France... She does convey the idea that Antoinette was vapid, and if that's what she was shooting for, she succeeds. Schwartzman looks anesthetized through the whole thing, mumbling his few lines with a stunned flatness befitting the dullness of the overall piece, but doing nothing to immerse the viewer in whatever the film was supposed to be about. What's the opposite of chemistry? That's what Dunst and Schwartzman have on screen together. Rip Torn adds a bit of leering lechery, but can't do much to help this floundering flick. The sparkling brilliance and danger of the real Versailles is absent entirely, along with any other vestige of historical reality, intelligence or wit. This movie might have been interesting if it had been more of a serious period piece or if it had been a surrealistic punk rock romp through an alternate universe of Versailles as dreamed by a dumb, spoiled little American girl, which Coppola, Dunst, et al, might actually have been able to pull off. Instead, it's an awkward, deadly dull and bloated exercise in pure pointless self indulgence in a way that even Versailles itself never was. It simply doesn't work at all. Technically, it's crap, from the awful cinematography to the wretched editing (many obvious and glaring errors- boom mikes, continuity, etc) all driven by the seeming absence of a script or anything to move the plot (such as it is) along. The awful fake 'sunset'- what _was_ up with that? All the scenes seem to take four times longer than they need to, which makes it all the more painful. This film takes an interesting historical character who lived at an amazingly dynamic time in history, and manages to render person, place, and time deadly dull. It was shot at Versailles, yet plays on screen as flat and claustrophobic rather than opulent and expansive. Politically, we are asked to identify with the symbol of a failed, corrupt monarchy, basically because she's cute and nonthreatening. Which brings up the one interesting point about this shipwreck: Perhaps in its flatulent excess, this 'film' somehow heralds a coming artistic revolution. After this, perhaps the peasants will storm the gates of the major studios, screaming for real creative bread. Or maybe we'll all just post on YouTube and quit wasting our money on studio garbage like this. Perhaps Sophia Coppola, and Kirsten Dunst along with her, will become the new Maries Antoinette of a new revolution in film and in art. Vive la revolution!",1,2,5,28 December 2006
Coffee and Cigarettes," Garbage, with some minor saving graces
","This self-obsessed Hollywood piece of crap is barely worth seeing. If you're a shallow, worthless Hollywood cult worshiper, you may find this lousy piece of cinematic trash worthy viewing because you hear the name of someone who knows somebody who knows someone who once may have heard of you mentioned. If you're not totally irredeemable, you'll avoid this worthless waste of celluloid like the plague. Jim Jarmusch has made decent, worthy films before (Dead Man especially) but this ain't one of em. Sad to say, I laughed at the cheaper shots in this film. Doesn't mean the film's worthwhile. Avoid. Avoid. There's a reason that RZA, GZA, Tom Waits, and Iggy Pop aren't movie stars. Seems like Jim called everybody he knew and said, please help me make a movie on your names, cause I can't make it on my talent. Lame, failure, pathetic... You'll have more fun becoming intimate with a vinyl doll, all things considered. ~spoiler~ There is no plot whatsoever in this flaccid piece of gutter streamer.",2,1,4,15 November 2005
Man on Fire," Moving, human, dark, and poignant
","It's hard to top this movie in several ways. Everything works really well here; the casting, acting, script, and cinematography are all first-rate. For the moviegoer, it's a moving, violent story of love and human redemption. For the film critic, there's plenty of sharp technique and technical merit. There are some tactical blunders, and as has been discussed on the boards, the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the CIA agent training angle. However, I took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the CIA agent's pragmatic approach, Creasy basically commends his soul to the Ultimate without considering the consequences. Like Jesus Himself, Creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, whether it actually makes pragmatic sense or not. In any case, I appreciated the fact that Creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and just caps the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice, which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent. In any case, this film is very much worth watching if you're at all attracted to the genre. An excellent soundtrack, great writing, flawless casting, and solid performances across the board make this a top-100 (or better) film.",9,6,10,3 November 2005
The Iron Giant," Great visuals wrapped around a horrendous infantile morality play
","This movie is beautiful, and full of neat details. Visually, I'd give it at least an 8. There's lots to love technically, the sound is great, the characters really work, and there are a lot of laughs. Unfortunately, the story is wretched at best, and actively evil at worst. The message is hypocritical in the extreme. Where Spiderman told us (rightly) that 'with great power comes great responsibility' this excuse for a moral tale says that with great power comes nothing but danger, and suicide is probably the best course of action. All violence is bad, and we can all choose what we want to be; even giant killer robots can be transformed into giant pu$$ies by the miracle of a small boy's love and friendship. Barf. As a moral tale, this is hypocritical and irresponsible garbage at best. The boy solemnly lectures the robot about death, saying 'guns kill' as if that's a bad thing. They mourn the death of a deer at the hands of evil hunters. But the boy is not a vegan, nor is his mother. So killing is okay as long as someone else does it, at a distance. That's amoral hypocrisy, nothing more. It gets worse- obviously the Iron Giant is a symbol, and he is the hero of the story, because he is the only character who changes. What is he a symbol for? Well, for Man's 'destructive' and 'flawed' nature. But the Iron Giant is obviously and explicitly a creation of something- he's a built artifact. So this implies a Creator metaphor; we're talking about God as Creator here. But God in this story is flawed, defective: He built a good, tender, sensitive creature and made the mistake of encasing that gentle soul in the form of a weapon. Or, He built a weapon and made the mistake of giving it a tender heart. Either way, God is flawed. Worse, the giant killer robot can't even distinguish a toy from a real threat, and thus self-defense is portrayed as unacceptably dangerous. And the only way to remedy this flaw is for the unfortunate creature to 'nobly' sacrifice himself rather than taking responsibility and using his tremendous power for good. The message is therefore ultimately Satanic: God is bad, and you're better off dead. When good people (and robots?) refuse to take their power, bad people take it by default. After all, a key component of evil is the lust for power over others. When evil has convinced everyone that the only acceptable method of resistance is pacifism, disempowerment, surrender, and suicide, then evil has truly won. Have we really fallen so far that we no longer know how to fight the good fight? Do we really think that all violence is 'bad'? Have thousands of years of culture, morality, and civilization really been swept away by a few decades of propaganda? The fact that this artful piece of toxic amorality has gotten so much acceptance suggests that much has been lost. The film is worth seeing as a pretty film, but I'd recommend sitting down afterward and discussing the values and lessons here with your family, in a critical way. I sure as hell wouldn't plunk my kid down in front of this with no discussion, because it's a powerful piece of propaganda that needs deconstruction. Or just destruction.",3,8,37,26 May 2009
