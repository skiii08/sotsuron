The Avengers," The second better avengers movie
","Avengers 1 is a movie with a meh art style and sometimes it feels to slow. The characters are good but actually are stereotypes of themself.
Iron man- the plaboy arrogant inconsequent.
Captain america- the man who always remembers that he's from 20th century.
Thor-the ignorant man.
Seeing the heroes is action is awesome, the story is solid and the villain is the best part. Tha action is wonderful and the cgi holds up well and is even better then most of the marvel superheroes movies.
And characters really evolve as a team",9,0,1,15 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Ok
","Captain marvel is a bad written movie with bad timing and with a formula that we've seen a billion times on this genre.
The skrulls are really good and they get the best scenes and well written scenes. Brie is good as captain and nick is perfect. The cgi is bad and the 3 act structure is poorly done.",6,1,5,9 March 2019
Aquaman," Good characters, wonderfull effects and an ok script
","Aquaman is full of cliches and deus ex-maquina, things only happen because the script wanted too, the story feels forced too.
But the acting is good for the most part, Momoa evolved and knows how to create an interesting character and Amber could be better. Daffoe and Patrick could apear more and black mantha to. The action and direction are wonderfull and the cgi is perfect and really of quality.
In an oversaturated genre, aquaman because of the effects and solid story is a fresh air, unfortunately, same can't be said about the script. As with a sequel underwater won't be anymore something new, if continues like that, it will be kinda bad.",7,0,2,9 January 2019
Deadpool 2," Better then the first one
","Some jokes are bad and sometimes the movie feels boooooooring.
But every character have a different personality and deadpool finally gets an evolution and some interesting conflicts.
The action sequences are awesome.",8,1,3,29 January 2019
Pacific Rim," Clich√© but fun
","Pacific rim is a movie with some bad dialogue, easy solutions (human part) and some overacting. It's dark and when tries comedy is horrible and unnecessary because seeing giants robots showing up is already an entertainment.
But knows what it is and the characters are interesting for the most part, the action is beatiful, the cgi perfect and the tension is wonderful. The colors and camera angles are beatiful and put an unique vision to a solid movie well put together.",8,0,1,10 February 2019
Justice League," A movie that doesn't even know if is good or bad
","Justice league is a Frankenstein, the story is badly developed and with characters who don't have depth even when are trying. Things just happens in an inconsistent film with tone, direction and even threath level.
The cgi is bad, the action scenes are just ok and seeing the most classical team for the first time isn't exciting. It does have good moments, but only that.",5,1,19,9 January 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The best spider-man movie in years
","The animation is wonderful, the action too and the story is simple and good done. Every character has some moment and peter and miles actually evolve during the story.",10,2,5,13 January 2019

Avengers: Infinity War," Marvel never gets tired of surprising
","An event builded for 10 years with no worries of developing deeply most part of it's characters (a merit) an.d sometimes (mainly during wakanda war) lacks balanced tone and for that, becomes some few times a cgi mess. But, even with the advantage of not developing, every character has personality and we fear for their lifes. The action scenes are balanced and well done except wakanda battle and when it embraces tension is awesome and well done. The cgi is good for the most part, thanos cgi is amazing.
Thanos is the best part, the movie is about him, he's the protagonist. It shows his rise in snapping and 'killing' half of the universe and his emotional fall. Gamora gets a lot more of deep (something that really lacked in GOTG 1 and 2) to.
A great accomplishment for marvel, russos and for the superheroes story in cinema.",9,0,4,8 January 2019
Transformers," A solid blockbuster
","Even with some stupid human characters, easy solutions and bad comedy is still a good movie. The cgi and action scenes are beautiful to watch and the plot is simple and solid.
The focus is Sam who's serves a purpose with Mikale and the story, bumblebee, optimus and a little of Megatron. But the other characters still get some unique thing.",7,1,2,29 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Potencial wasted
","Star wars ep8 have good actions scenes (in most part), amazing scenes direction, amazing soundtrack, the best art direction in the franchise and a good cast. However, characters are stupid, with no journey and evolution (except for luke and kylo ren). Ep8 blows up everything ep7 has put on the desk and beyond that, lost a amount of time with characters doing absolute nothing (more then 30m). An ambitious movie but potencial, but bad executed.",5,2,6,8 January 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Boooooring
","Avengers 2 creates more depth to it's characters, everyone has a moment and a conflict. But at the same time it lost so many time trying to stablish the future that gets boring, slow and without focus or plot clear direction.
Ultron has a lot of potencial, but finds himself in a lot of subplots and characters that he gets without enough time to be developed.
The action is good at least and even better then the first one. Basically the only problem with age of ultron is the amount of subplots and characters trying to stablish the future.",7,0,3,15 January 2019
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Cgi show
","Nothing makes sense, the diogue is bad, characters are bad and u don't remember something about more then a half of them and to long.
Tha action is still good honestly and the cgi wonderful. The less u think about it the better gets your experience, only if u can pass throughout the long boring humans sequences",2,1,4,29 January 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," An epic conclusion
","The end of a great trilogy shows the downfall of Bruce Wayne, phisic and psychological and how he learns that has to get up and RISE.
Some may say: batman appears so few times in this movie. But it's about Bruce and how Batman is a part of him, both in the end are the same thing and fall. It's about Bruce accepting he's a man capable of feel fear and that's what makes him strong.
Of course some things are messed up. The plot have some boring easy ways to advance the story like: catwoman saving batman in the most convenient time, don't activating the bomb before batman returns and bruce returning to gotham in so little time. And, sometimes the acting of Ghul is kinda bad and her death is stupid and with lack of emotion.
Catwoman is the best part, Blake is interesting, Jim as always is amazing, Bane is a good villain with a real threath to the hero, Talia is bad, Alfren as always is amazing and others are good with their own papers.
The dark knight rises ends the trilogy with some issues, but it's a great ending to everything batman begins started.",9,1,2,19 January 2019
Black Panther," Isn't an overrated film
","Black Panther knows how to create good characters with at least some trait and personality. T' 'chala is a hero and a good man but that doesn't means he's perfect and without conflicts. Nakia, okoye and shuri have their own personality and conflicts or convictions. Killmonger is a good villain with personality and real motivations.
About the politics: this is part of the movie inside it own rules. Wakanda wasn't beeing free to the world and the whole thing is about that and killmonger wanted this because of they killing his father and don't helping the persons he saw suffering and did too. Wakanda has every resource to help the outside world and the discussion is if they will and how will.
Beyond that, black panther brings a cultural celebration and is everything part of the movie.
The only flaws are the action and the cgi in the end. But because those people complaining about the politics saying nonsense thing I'll give a 10/10. It was for be a 9/10.",10,1,13,14 January 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Ambitious, courage and visuals # good movie
","Basically, BvS is ambitious, brave and brings stoning visuals. It does tries new things for the genre and the actors are goods, but, isn't equal to good movie.
BvS lacks a good script, the editing is a mess and the characters development is badly done with a lot of wasted potencial. The cgi is good until the end and things just happens. Lex Luthor is a mess without motivation.
The film pass a lot of it trying to discuss about superman on earth, only for in the end becomes a cgi mess with a cgi battle.",4,0,3,9 January 2019
