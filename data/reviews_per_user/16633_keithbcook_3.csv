The Blair Witch Project," very disappointing
","There are. of course, many films that (maybe because of the hype) end up disappointing/ This is such a film - VERY disappointing and a waste of time.It was a strange film and that is what I expected. It moved slowly and did not seem to be going anywhere. I persevered with it as I did not want to pass judgement on only part of the film seen. I soon realised it was going to be one of those 'different' films where it either worked (and worked marvellously well) or it dived.There seemed to be something happening at the end, and then the film ended. I was left feeling not only disappointed but also frustrated that something like this could be passed for a film (or movie if you are American).",1,1,4,8 February 2007
The Hangover," not funny!
","This has all the makings of something really special and a film where men (especially) can relate to on one of their drunken nights when they cannot remember the night before (is it always because the party is so good that you cannot remember - somehow do not think so!) and as the car sped off and they took their first drink on the roof tops, I was almost rubbing my hands together in anticipation.Then.... DISAPPOINTMENT it was suddenly the next morning and as the film unfolded we see how many ridiculous activities they could get up to in one night (think they MUST have ran our of hours?) If this was a comedy then I want my money back, This did not even produce a smile. Then I read that part 2 is not so funny....",1,6,10,14 January 2012
Lost in Translation," disappointing
","Film ambles slowly and depressingly to...no where! It only just picks up when the film ends. Very disappointing and a bit of a mismatch. Hoped it would be a love story but it was not. Shames as I usually like Bill Murray. Very improbable plot and little other information ie with the respective partners. Where was the leading lady's husband, he was in and out only fleetingly. Not enough deep dialogue for my liking and therefore the film did not fit into any real category.As there was little action, I would have hoped for better topics of conversation between the two leading characters. The dialogue was pretty shallow really and I am not sure what the film was trying to achieve. I was left disappointed and empty as this film was quite long in duration. At the time it started to take off and Bill Murray was making some real decision (or so I was hoping he would), in the end he didn't! The ending was the biggest disappointment of all. Missed a great opportunity to turn things around and I would not have felt unhappy at sitting through that first 90 minutes. When the opportunity arose to so something inspiring - it ended!",2,7,14,15 August 2011
