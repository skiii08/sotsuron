The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The terrors of war and suppression
","Many people misjudge this movie by comparing it with the book. Looking at the movie independently, I don't think of it as a bad movie. In my opinion its a very great movie that portrays amazingly well the gruesomeness and consequences of totalitarian regimen and how people rise up against their evil dominator and how rebellion is stoked. Both sides use clever propaganda to gain more followers or make the enemy loose hope and loose followers. Katniss has emerged as a symbol of hope and resistance against the Capitol. The movie shows us well how in war every decision made, might it be to save your friends or to create hope by broadcasting powerful speeches, will have a response from the enemy that could result in a loss of more supporters and casualties. It brings to the viewer a much a darker and realistic view on civil war, its terror and suppression as some other movies featuring the same thematic. The movie is a bit more reserved when it comes to action and battles, but focuses more on the psychological aspect.",7,0,0,16 December 2018
