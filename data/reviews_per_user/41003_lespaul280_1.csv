The New World," Sloooooow
","This movie really had great promise. I mean, look at the cast, Christopher Plummer, Colin Farrell, Christian Bale, Jonathn Pryce... But the dialog is very sparse; half of it is just voice overs from the three main characters. The score is very weak, and poorly reflects the tone of the scenes. The film just drags on and on for hours. I know people are going dismiss me and say it's a beautifully shot and scripted film, and I'm an idiot, or that I just didn't get it. That's fine. I just really didn't like it. I normally don't post reviews for films on here, but this time, I just had to. I couldn't believe how bad this film was. I mean, Malick normally does fantastic work. This time, he just falls short. Another thing, is there really isn't a whole lot of character development. It's like they just expect you to know all of these people just because it's an American folk tale (yes I know that it's based on true events). I'm Canadian, and I was pretty confused as to what was going on for the first twenty minutes or so. I was pretty bummed, because I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Now, I want my three hours (which felt like five) and my eight bucks back.",1,1,8,29 January 2006
