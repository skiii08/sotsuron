Casablanca," Blanca
","This was the first time I have ever watched Casablanca, I thought it was alright. Yes, I know it's a classic, but I was really liked the plot a lot and the story line. I liked how it was places during World War 2. I thought that the directing and camera work was great. The picture was clear and the camera movement was steady. Also the acting was amazing, I especially enjoyed the most of the characters, I did like Humphrey which I guess a lot of people didn't. I thought the movie did go a little slow and could have been edited a little bit better in some places. I think this movie would have been better to watch in color for the first time.",6,0,4,11 May 2010
Lifeboat," lost at sea
","I really enjoyed the film Lifeboat. I'm ashamed of admitting this, but I haven't seen a lot of Hitchcock films, but this is defiantly one of my favorites. He is such an amazing director, he can do so much with so little, and make it enjoyable. I thought Constance did really well in this film. She reminded me of my grandmother in a weird way, especially her choice of outfits and attitude. I liked that the movie was based in World War 2, that the Nazi's and German's were involved. The sounds and editing were great. I liked how Hitchcock could capture a moment just by focusing on one point. My grandfather told me that Hitchcock made the film just how Steinbeck wrote it in his novel. Which I thought was great, how many films do you see and say 'that was better then the book'.",9,2,2,9 May 2010
Citizen Kane," great great
","Citizen Kane has to be one of my 'old time' favorites, and not because it's Donald Trumps favorite movie. I LOVED Mr. Kane, he did remind me of someone on the Rocafeller type of guy. I thought the editing was great it went perfect with the photography. I enjoyed the long shots, and how the camera moved slowly to make sure you have the experience. The sounds were something that I would hear in a film made today. It was clear, and it made you feel like you were sitting at his desk. I liked how it was a fast pace movie. I liked how they did the flashbacks, it reminded me of Goodfellas. I strongly advise EVERYONE to see this movie.",10,0,1,9 May 2010
Fargo," def NOT
","Fargo wasn't my favorite. I thought it was a little overrated from what I heard about it even before seeing it. I thought Frances was an alright actress but her character kind of bored me. She did nothing for me. It bored me. I thought other movies were a lot better then this film. That's why i couldn't believe she won. The film work was okay but I didn't like the plot at all. It was dragging, I liked how the director did capture some of the scenes well but come on really? I don't think Frances should of won an award for this. I thought it couldn't of even been a 'b' movie. The police were a joke. I didn't believe any of it. What about the ending? I was confused, but i felt bad for jerry (somewhat).",1,4,11,5 May 2010
Apocalypse Now," bad
","I have to say that I did not enjoy the film Apocalypse Now, maybe because I'm not a fan of war movies. This film was awful, it was boring it had no theme in my opinion. It was just dragging on and on and on. The acting was HORRIBLE, I thought silent films were 100 percent better then this. I think this had to be a low budget movie, because the special effects were something from the 1920s, I thought the camera work were choppy and the sounds were delayed in some of the scenes. I strongly do NOT recommend this movie to anyone, unless you enjoy low budget war movies, that you like to sleep through. It was confusing as well, i have no idea what half the stuff they were talking about.",1,7,21,9 May 2010
The Exorcist," Not scary
","I watched this movie with a family member who actually saw this when it first came out in the theaters. They told me it was a lot better in the theater. They also told me that film was one of the greatest movies that came out in their time. I thought it was so-so, nothing to write home about. Yes I know, it's a classic and how can I say that. Come on? Really with the 'special effects' I laughed out loud. Not scary at all, but of course my family members were still scared to this day. The filming was okay, the camera work wasn't what I thought it would be. But I have to say I did enjoy the sound effects. They were different from what other movies I've seen before. My favorite character was the priest, I felt bad for him but he was a good actor. Not so much for the young girl.",5,3,8,5 May 2010
The Graduate," live
","The Graduate was a film that every young adult could relate to. That's why I really liked this film. While watching it, there was so many times I would say 'whoa is this my life'. Everyone has that pressure after college that you have no idea what the heck your going to do after you graduate. Your parents are asking you, your family members are wondering, and even your other classmates want to know what you are going to do for the rest of your life. Not everyone knows and its alright. The graduate showed yout hat you are not the only person in the world that doesn't know what you are doing for the rest of your life. I liked how the director caught that. I also loved Mr. Robinson, he reminded me of my uncle, who still tells me to relax and live life.",8,1,1,11 May 2010
Psycho," love Hitchcock
","Psycho might be the greatest horror film ever. Oh my lord, I couldn't believe how amazing this film actually was. Of course my favorite scene was the shower scene. I actually watched this scene twice cause you try and not to miss any part of it. I love the sounds and the angles Hitchcock used to get this perfect shot. How did he do it? I couldn't believe it. The entire movie was brilliant, I loved the acting. They could of not picked a better actress then Lila. She brought acting to a whole other level. I haven't seen a horror film ever like this. It was more believable then the average Friday the 13th film. Some of my friends haven't seen this yet, but I will make sure that they do.",10,0,3,11 May 2010
