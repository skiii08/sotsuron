Blade Runner 2049," Needs a trim...
","With the history of the original Blade Runner, it is very hard not to go into the theater without at least a little concern that, 'This movie will not measure up.' In the end I would say, 'It did and it didn't.' The film contains a good mix of story and action, and plot twists continue throughout to keep you guessing. The biggest problem for me was the length. It seemed to go on and on just to have time for another twist. Remove a good half-hour and the film, I think, would have been better. Meanwhile, even at its current length, don't expect all your questions to be answered. They won't.",7,1,2,11 October 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," An Unfortunate Mistake
","Great suspense, Goodman doing an excellent job portraying a man with compulsions, preparing the viewer all the way.Was he as crazy as it appears? Was there a very different, unsavory purpose in bringing the pretty young Michelle to his bunker? His story itself seemed quite implausible. Still, there was the woman begging for help. There was the scratches on the window spelling out exactly that word. Could he have set all of that up? But what about his daughter, and what really happened to her? Lots of questions, and no answers.And then the blunder.***SPOILER***Watch it first, or you won't understand, and even then you may disagree, but the movie was 5 minutes too long. The point of the story was simple. Howard claimed something terrible had happened on earth, Michelle didn't believe him. After several failed attempts, she succeeds in reaching the outdoors. Serene, peaceful, birds seen in their migratory formation. Ripping off her homemade gas mask, Michelle's thoughts can easily be read. 'He lied to us! He lied to us!' And then in the distance a noise coming from the sky.At first it is difficult to tell what we are seeing, but as it approaches, it is clearly not any craft we have ever seen before. Lines are dropped from it, and alien creatures descend, no more than a few feet from the terrified Michelle.Cut to a closeup, Michelle screaming in horror. Cut to black. Roll the credits.That is the way it should have ended. Minus 2 stars for certain for the writers' and director's failure to know when to stop, when enough is enough. What a shame.",6,2,4,30 August 2016
Deja Vu," Why, Denzel? Why?
","My wife and I love Denzel, but his choice to do this script? Inexplicable.The premise is this. Denzel, an ATF agent, is recruited to join a very special, experimental unit on their first case. Using unimaginable technology, this group is able to put together surveillance data from four satellites (and one would have to presume other sources as well) and, four days later, present it essentially as a movie. The preposterous (I know, I know, 'Sci-Fi') part of it is they are able to swoop down to ground level and show video looking not only inside a building, but even a close-up of its occupants. Using the latest 'heat technology,' they can not only show the outline of a body, they can present how many hairs in an eyebrow, eye color, even expressions the person in view made that many days in the past. What's more, they can, even from space mind you, display non-heat producing objects like pictures on a wall! Yep, they can! But get this. With all this technology, they have no ability to record/save any of what they see! Fire the guy that forgot that element. So...The current issue is a bombing that took 500+ lives and the determination to discover the 'terrorist' responsible. 'As luck would have it,' a body washes up on shore appearing to be a victim of the bombing, but Denzel's character notices something that makes him dig deeper. Though intended to appear as just another victim, this person, we discover, was dead before the incident, but it is clear the bomber was in fact responsible for the woman's death. Denzel's take? Find the murderer, find the bomber.Introduced now to this investigative team and their tools (even Denzel can't believe it, but of course the script told him to 'suspend disbelief' so he does after only a few questions), he encourages turning the focus to this woman victim and track her life for those four days. Maybe, though the team is adamant 'we can't change the past,' they can see enough to track down the culprit. I will stop there.Just, and spoilers begin right here, along with the omniscience necessary to go anywhere at any time from 'four satellites,' voices can be heard, notes can be read, and with heat sensor technology (?) even phone displays can be represented in 1080p. (I don't think 4k existed then. Maybe in the sequel.) The result of all this is indeed the capture of the bomber, not a Muslim of course, that would offend the PC's out there, but a fruit-loop 'doing God's work.' And then the fun really begins.Afraid of exposing their technology, the investigative team leader calls everything off, but that doesn't stop Denzel. Instead he enters (you had to see this coming) a 'time capsule' and goes back in time four days to try to stop the incident. (Anybody remember, 'We can't change the past'?) But preposterous wouldn't be preposterous without, well, more 'preposterosity'! (I just made that word up and I like it!)Getting there 'just in time' (after being revived in a hospital like a heart attack patient), Denzel rescues the girl but, himself is blown into little tiny pieces when the bomb, this time, goes off under water. No problem. Because somehow he was split in two and, in real time, though in real time he entered the capsule and went backward, he also didn't. That's right, up walks Denzel to investigate a different crime scene, only minutes after he was destroyed. Thank goodness there won't be big enough chunks of what was his other self to cause him to wonder, 'Am I dead? Or am I really, really dead?'I give. If you can suspend disbelief this much you're a better man, or woman, than I! I would give it 1 star, but there is Denzel, and face it. He is about as good as it gets at his profession. This was simply not the vehicle to prove it.",2,0,1,4 May 2018
Lion," Touching yet missing something...
","I hate to oppose so many, particularly because I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Many touching moments, particularly well-played by both actors portraying Saroo, by his brother Guddu, and of course by his mother, most in the few moments of the movie's ending. Don't miss seeing it!Now, that said, and trying to be careful not to give anything away, we neither see Saroo's mom searching for him, nor do we see the relationship between Saroo's adoptive parents and himself develop. Please, don't tell me about it, show me! Don't tell me, 'There are many more trophies in the garage,' show me dad at his practices encouraging him when he stumbles. Show me his mother at his games. Show Saroo victorious, holding up his trophy while looking at them both. Show them helping him with homework, teaching him to drive, give us something that demonstrates the relationship we are supposed to believe exists.For me, this serious flaw takes an otherwise '9' movie and makes it a '6.' I wish I had a part in the script development. I wish the movie had but 5 or 10 more minutes to display what it wanted us to believe.",6,1,1,29 June 2017
Before Sunset," Mmmm... Maybe
","I'm probably just 'out of step,' but I don't see the high rating. The profanity is over the top throughout, and the only basis for a relationship between the two is sexual, apparently something not at all (SPOILER ALERT!!!) reserved for each other. What I saw was a woman constantly griping about everything, finding any way she could to turn every comment of her husband's into cause for an argument, and since the movie is little more than dialogue, this and the vulgarity made it difficult to endure. Having read Ms. Delpy's self-description, then seeing she was one of the primary writers, it all made sense. She simply played herself, no acting required. Now, I certainly can't tell anyone to forgo an 8.0 rated film, but if I could, I would. It really isn't worth spending 109 minutes hearing 'f'.",3,1,2,23 August 2014
The Mist," Entertain or mock Christians? What was the real goal?
","Perhaps the worst 'horror movie' I have ever seen, and I've seen many decades of them. First, the premise was ridiculous. Second, the 'monster' was an octopus on land. Third, people who saw strangers arrive bloodies and claiming 'Something's out there!' were immediately forgotten by a main character who claimed his next-door-neighbor was simply trying to embarrass him. Fourth, well, no matter how many shrieks and bloodies bodies, it was laughable not scary. That, however, isn't the major sin of this 2 hr waste of time.How is it people with no real knowledge of Christians always think they can portray them, and always do so in the worst light? No one has ever acted like the character in the movie, but if your goal is to influence those with no more knowledge than you have, just make stuff up with the confidence that you won't be found out. By the way, 'Revelations' isn't a Bible book. We can begin there. Liberals run amok on this one and I have to wonder. Why don't they mock Muslims the same way?Pitiful. Don't waste your time.",1,2,14,10 June 2019
