Spartacus," if you like 'The Gladiator', watch the real story
","After spartacus, I don't think that any gladiator based movie will effect you. 'Spartacus' is a legendary movie in the history of the 7th art.
The cast is marvelous, they played as if they're the characters. The scenes are masterpieces. Kubrick says 'I know how to make a big movie' in this movie by this movie",9,0,2,4 January 2002
The Prestige," sensational script, good acting, marvelous job
","one of the best movies of 2006. I saw the movie in a business activity, and god knows I thought 'another time-wasting movie, what the hell I'm doing here, why am i not in my bed instead of being here?'. But i was wrong. from the first scenes, I was in the story. director is also very good at taking the audience wherever he wants them to be.The cast was very elite. Sir Michael Caine, as one of my favorites on all times, is doing a great job as Cutter ( as usual ). Hugh Jackman and Christian bale are the best actors for the roles as two 'competitor to wherever it goes' magicians.The story is also astonishing, seeing Tesla on the script makes me wonder, 'what the hell's going around, why Hollywood is talking about Tesla, the genius? someone's gonna tell the world about some wonders, which Tesla invented in recent years?' at last, I saw thousands of movie, I can understand what the hell is going on in a movie by watching it 5 minutes ( this is Hollywood's and the movie company^s bloody sin in the movie industry. making nonsense for idiots, or a few dollars more...) . This movie is absolutely not one of those clich√© Hollywood produced movie!s.I highly recommend it to everyone.",9,2,3,28 December 2006
Coyote Ugly," one of the worst films of the history
","I'm very proud of myself for not to see this movie in a cinema. It's awful man, only a few nice chicks dancing around(  I think it's only 3 times in the movie  ).poor dialogs, nothing more to tell about. so if anybody says 'c'mon let's buy this dvd, you can easily say 'no'",2,1,2,26 March 2001
The Matrix," A masterpiece
","After a long wait, at last I saw this masterpiece. Everybody has to see this movie. If you love sci-fci or not this movie will shock you.I refused to see this movie on videoCD or DVD while my friend recommended it to me. But I saw that I was right to wait it for a theatre.Especially the slow motion parts were like poetry. It hit me like a truck. I was stucked to the chair.I was in a great pleasure after I left the theater.just go and see it.",Null,0,1,3 September 1999
