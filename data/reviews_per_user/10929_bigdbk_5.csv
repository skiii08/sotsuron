Hereditary," Creepy As Hell
","This movie creeped me out in a way I haven't been in many, many years. The ending could've been better but overall definitely a good watch. Up there with The Conjuring in my opinion.",8,7,12,6 September 2018
Gone Girl," Potentially Great Film Ruined By Ending
","I will preface this review by saying that, for no particular reason, it took my wife and I 5 years to finally get around to this movie we have always wanted to see. The first hour was enjoyable, interesting story, good acting, endless possibilities. The second hour even better, amazing twist, even more possibilities! However.... the last ten minutes destroyed all hope for this to be the great film we anticipated based on reviews we have read over the years. A terribly unrealistic, unsatisfying ending brought this almost great movie from a 9/10 rating to the 6/10 you see before you. Not to dwell but the ending was so disappointing that it reminded me of an old low budget horror movie from the 80s that leaves an opening at the end for a sequel that would end up even more underwhelming than the original. I am not recommending that anyone skip this movie, just cut it off around the 2 hr 20 min mark and make up your own ending. ANYTHING would be better than the ending that played out. Oh... the unnecessary fading to black in and out of every scene gave the feel of something edited on an old desktop.",6,2,2,9 November 2019
Joker," Lives Up To The Hype
","Nothing much to say except, this is what cinema should be. An amazing film and the performance of a lifetime by Joaquin Phoenix! Arthur's further descent into madness portrayed perfectly. We can all identify with sadness, Phoenix's performance makes you sympathize with this disturbed, neglected man. This was the best film I have seen in a long time.",10,5,11,12 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Should Have Left IT Alone
","2 hours and 50 minutes. Way, way, WAY too long. I loved the original, you know the horror film with just enough comic relief? This thing on the other hand was a huge letdown. It dragged on and on and on like The Irishman. No balance between comedy and horror. Way too much CGI, at times it felt like I was watching a video game. Bill Hader's performance was the only bright spot for me but even he couldn't save this train wreck. Don't waste your time, just watch the original two times in a row.",5,2,4,12 December 2019
Green Book," Such a let down
","Terrible acting, TERRIBLE. No chemistry between the two main chracters. Clich√© all the way through. What was the Academy thinking?!",4,4,9,23 March 2019
