First Man," Claire Foy
",Claire Foy should've been nominated for a Razzie. I don't see how she was nominated for a Golden Globe for this performance.,2,3,5,15 February 2019
It," Lame
","I thought it was a lame remake. 
I never read the novel but I'm assuming 
it took place 
when they were 
adults and Pennywise 
came back. 
That was what happened in 
the original.
The remake only takes place
when they 
are kids.
Also the actor who played 
Pennywise wasn't 
very good.",1,1,1,13 January 2018
Us," Disappointed
",I enjoyed Get Out by Jordan Peele but was disappointed with his second film. The movie could've been a lot shorter. There was no reason to drag it out into a 2 hour film. Boring plot.,1,5,7,23 June 2019
The Irishman," 3 hours 29 minutes
",It didn't need to be 3 hours and 29 minutes long. Also Anna Paquin should've received a Razzie nomination for her brief performance.,2,4,8,6 March 2020
Ocean's Thirteen," Very Slow
",I found this one to be very slow. I enjoyed Ocean's Eleven. Ocean's Twelve was kind of lame. This one was very slow moving. They should have stopped after the first one. I don't understand the need to make sequels of almost every movie. I also found Ellen Barkin's character to be very annoying and irrelevant.,2,1,2,28 October 2017
Interstellar," Unrealistic Age Changes
",The age change of the characters is unrealistic. Murph ages on earth but Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway don't age in space.,5,0,17,31 March 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Mildred's son
",Mildred's son is too old to still be living at home with his mom. Also Mildred's ex husband has a huge nose.,8,0,1,16 February 2020
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Sarah Connor
","If Sarah Connor is only 29 now, which they said she is in Terminator 2, how could she have a son John's age? I would guess he's supposed to be at least 15. That would've meant she had John when she was around 14. He wasn't born yet in the first Terminator movie. Sarah got pregnant by the the guy sent to save her in the first movie. Sarah was an adult in the first movie.",8,2,2,31 July 2017
World Trade Center," Worst Movie Ever
","Terrible movie!Completely unnecessary and boring. Two firemen trapped in the rubble talking to each other while showing footage from that day.I see they are making a movie called 9/11 with Whoopi Goldberg. I watched the trailer, it looks just as bad, if not worse.Just leave it alone, we all know what happened that day.",1,1,4,21 July 2017
Rudy," Coaches
","It's your typical football movie, a bunch of overweight coaches yelling at the players.",2,0,0,24 April 2020
Con Air," Pregnant
","How can Cameron's wife be pregnant with his child? At the beginning, he is coming home from being in the Army. His wife is at the bar (what she's doing in a bar when she is pregnant is another good question). You can tell she's not very far into her pregnancy by looking at her. If I were Cameron, I would question whether or not I was the father. Maybe one of the guys at the bar she seems to be a regular at knocked her up.",8,0,1,8 September 2017
Mother!," Odd
",It started off good but fell apart later. I found it interesting up until Michelle Pfeiffer and Ed Harris left the house. It started to fall apart at that point. All the people showing up at the house (supposed fans of Javier Bardem) was kind of lame. At that point the rest of the movie was these people destroying their house and eating her baby after she had it. I gave it 5 stars because the first half was a 10 and the last half was a 1.,5,1,2,11 January 2018
Unbroken," Terrible Movie
","Maybe Angelina Jolie should stick to acting instead of directing, but I don't think she's very good at acting either.",1,0,2,29 March 2020
Goodfellas," Ray Liotta
",Trying to pass Ray Liotta off as a 21 year old was a joke.,5,1,4,28 June 2018
Jurassic Park," Samuel L. Jackson
","I like the movie but Samuel L. Jackson chain smoking in the movie is really unnecessary. You might as well give every kid who sees the movie a pack of cigarettes. Every time I see the movie, I wonder what the point of having his character chain smoking is. It's the most disgusting part of the movie.",10,2,6,16 September 2017
