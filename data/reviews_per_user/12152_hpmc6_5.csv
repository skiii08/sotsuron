Frost_Nixon," Much less than it could have been
","It's still probably worth seeing, I like 20th century American history stuff a lot, so I had a great interest in the topic. I'll give it a 6 because the subject is worthwhile, and it's not pure junk like a lot of movies out there. But it was a really flat one dimensional portrayal of what is in fact, a fascinating subject - a duel between a British interviewer and one of the USA's most fascinating presidents.The best acting was the Frost character. And the movie dos do a good job of portraying what he put on the line, as well as the 'winner take all' nature of the duel. His underlings were very unlikable characters, although one of them did convey the single minded 'get Nixon' negativity that many people had at the time, and a lot of people were happy to move on from.The first half of the movie is really pretty boring. It was a completely missed opportunity to better portray who Nixon was, and what he had on the line. Love him, hate him, despise or respect him, he was a fascinating character. A lot of people seeing this movie are too young to remember him, and those older still have things they can learn. Just looking on hulu last night, I found stuff on Nixon I'd never seen beforehulu.com nbc-news-time-capsule-richard-m-nixon-in-his-own-wordsdoes anyone think that some of this material wouldn't have given this movie more depth in the first half, and could have replaced some of the 'fluff'? The whole movie can be pretty much summed up by 'does Frost get Nixon, or not?', which may have been the primary issue in the interviews, but certainly not all of it. Most people, including myself, already thought he was guilty - what difference does it really make whether he admits it or not? The acting of Nixon is mixed - I thought it was very weak in the beginning, but did come together more at the end, as did the movie - the movie does at least, improve and come together at the end.But there was more to those interviews than 'slipping up and confessing Watergate'. These interviews, like Nixon himself, had more than the one dimension of Watergate. It was a capstone of one of the most significant players (whether he was a good guy, or not) of the Cold War, a potential nuclear conflict that was the biggest threat humanity has ever known This movie completely missed that.",6,7,16,13 January 2009
Forrest Gump," Watchable, with the right expectations
","What I mean by this is, if a group of friends really wanted to rent it, I wouldn't spend a 'veto' against the film with the group, but I wouldn't pick it either. It's tolerable if you don't expect too much from this 'box of chocolates'.I saw this when it came out, and I haven't seen it since.What struck me, was that when it was over, that people exiting the film were completely silent. I don't know why the other people in the theater were silent, but I was because the film really didn't deliver. I felt it took me on a long trip to nowhere. Those in my group felt the same way. But clearly, many other people feel otherwise.While somewhat watchable and pleasant enough to see unfold, and mildly funny at times, expectations of 'something profound' are instead met with a really shallow parade of clich√©s and stereotypes in a narcissistic baby-boomer nostalgia orgy, the kind of thing that was already wearing out it's welcome from 'the big chill' film & 'thirty-something' type TV shows.The viewer seems obligated to sit there and click on pop icons of the baby boomer past, to make them get off the screen and move on to the next. It's a very shallow parade through history.I'm not politically correct by any means, but it does seem like the worst stereotype was pushed of the Vietnam vet, along with other characters, I'm sure many people found some of these characters degrading. A 'slow person' was kind of made fun of, without any real purpose. Some parts of the movie, such as 'the run' was just spontaneous, stupid and pointless.If I had no real expectations, I might not have found it as offensive. But the presentation as though this was something culturally profound when it's not left me flat.",5,5,10,31 March 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," If you liked 'Forest Gump', you'll probably like it, and if you didn't
","you probably won't like this one either. Personally, I didn't - but I'll give this movie a 6 (would have gone 5.5 if half stars were allowed, rounding up) because it isn't pure junk, obviously not low budget. But it's no 'masterpiece' either.The parallels to Gump are the style of narration by an odd character, the characters he encounters along the way (tug boat captain very close parallel to Gumps' Vietnam Lt.), as well as pointless asides for a set up (lady swimming the channel). Like Gump, the movie plays at the expense of some segments of society. (Gump, being slow people, B Button being old people portrayed as physically unattractive, even scary. B Pitt will most likely age far better in real life than this movie portrayed 'his older self' - most people do. The movie seemed to glorify youth) Like Gump, the movie has some forced emotionalism, at the end, B Button presents some flat statements as something profound.There's also the positive portrayal of some bad morality, B Button's old girlfriend cheating on her new husband, with seemingly no regret whatsoever.Beyond the 'Gump' comparisons, what could be an interesting period piece gets bogged down in 2 hours spent not even getting out of the early 1940s. This is a 60 minute idea, played out in over 2 1/2 hours.And the obvious plausibility flaws about reducing size at both ends of life.But credit where credit is due, it does have a few redeeming points about life - that a chain of seemingly random events can change someone's life (segment where the woman's dancing career is ended.) And the point where the right people might cross paths at the wrong time (B Button visiting New York).As far as the acting goes, I think they're pretty much playing out the dictates of the script. I really don't know what more they could have done with it.I'm rarely aware of editing, or even think about it. But an improved movie could be made by cutting 1/2 hour our of the first half, I think it was poorly edited.I had never heard of this movie, 1 hour prior to seeing it, it was a last minute invite. The Gump comparisons were made by myself and my group immediately after the show - there was no prior suggestion of it from anyone else. Yet, clearly many people came to the same conclusion.I said in my review of Forest Gump (on IMDb), that I wouldn't pick the movie, but I wouldn't spend a 'veto' against it with a group of friends who really wanted to see it either. I think that applies here too.",6,1,3,2 January 2009
Mulholland Drive," Very Original
","The movie has that 'other worldly' feel of Lynch films, which I respect, but am not fanatical about.It kind of gave me a headache following it, and could be kind of slow at times, it's a long movie. The acting is good, Watts in particular. Her range is remarkable.It does however, have a payoff that is very original. They definitely put a lot into it, a plot that is very differentI think it's a better film than 'Blue Velvet', I think Mulholland Drive's story has more of a point to it, and comes together better by the end of the movie, than BV did.",7,1,3,6 November 2006
The Hurricane," Long, boring, biased film contradicted by recent radio interview of the real man
","I heard an interesting radio interview of the real man this film was made about, earlier this week. Sounded like a decent guy and an interesting story. I had never heard of this story before.Hollywood ruined this story with it's heavy handed politically correct agenda. The real man in the radio interview is an interesting, likable man who has valuable introspection and insight. But the Denzel Washington character is just that - a Denzel Washington character. The same one he plays in every film I've ever seen him. The perfect African American man, surrounded by inferior whites, who could be saved by him if only they would overcome their racism. A character and reality that lives nowhere except on a Hollywood script.Perhaps the greatest insult of this film is toward the man they made the film about, rather than the white audiences, in that they felt he wouldn't be likable or sympathetic if they told the truth, which the real man in radio interviews seems perfectly willing to do.I've seen my last Denzel Washington film. Whatever his future film might be, I've already seen it.",2,4,6,2 July 2011
