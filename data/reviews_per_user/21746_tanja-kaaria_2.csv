The Avengers," Really entertaining superhero movie
","No twists or difficult to follow plots, this movie was easy watching from start to very end. Obviously the idea is used million times before (evil declares war on world, heroes try to stop them, evil seems to be winning, government decides to nuke the evil and sacrifice the heroes at the same time, but in the end the heroes save the day) BUT I don't think movies like this ever go old. I am a 32 years old woman and felt like making a cape out of my sheets and go play superheroes after I saw this movie. It was really funny at parts (the whole theatre was laughing) and the action bits weren't overly long which usually make me go 'yawn'!. All in all, this movie is the best one I have seen in a long time, and I am usually very critical about movies. Also, I think I am in love with Robert Downie Jr now.",9,2,6,2 May 2012
The Hunger Games," Hunger Games from the view of a person who read the books more than once
","I went to see this movie with my boyfriend who has not read the books. He loved it, I felt a bit let down but I was expecting it as the books were very good and nothing ever compares to the book, no matter how good the movie is... well maybe LOTR extended version but that's about it.They did change some things, like how Katniss got the mockingjay pin or how Cato died so quickly etc. They also let some things very vague, like why was Gale's name in the lottery 42 times. I actually had to explain it to my boyfriend because he didn't understand it. They also didn't include Avoxes (which is weird as they will play a role in the last story) and also the rest of the prep team was missing (which again is strange as they are part of the 3rd story in the books).Besides these quite minor details I found the movie quite entertaining. But it is definitely not a massive cult movie unfortunately. The capitol was quite well made but for example the flaming suits in the parade just seemed cheap to what I had imagined in my mind. The whole production actually seemed quite cheap, which is a shame because it had potential to be so much more.But if I have to say some good things about this movie I have to mention the actors. I think the casting was extremely well done, a special mention to Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, Elizabeth Banks as Effie, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta (so cute) and Donald Sutherland as president Snow. Also the music was pretty good.Lets hope they learn from this 1st movie and make the next two less shaky and PLS make it rated 16 or something. We need to have blood in a movie where the whole idea is around people killing each other, jeez for once stop thinking about the kids and make a proper movie for the adults...8 for a great story (thanks to the book) and for great actors. Unfortunately the director really should be fired.",8,3,9,4 April 2012
