Come and See," It was much more terrifying in real life
","Recently I have read the book of Alexander Dukov 'What Soviet people fought for'. I think this book will never be issued in the West. I think Europeans (not only Germans) killed 15-20 millions civil people in the Soviet Union, including 5-7 millions children. But some children survived, like Flera and here is their recollections, I took from the book of Dukov.Me and my father drove on the cart, then he stopped horse and told me «I must take a look». Germans killed his cousin near that place. So, he walked into the forest and I followed him. Suddenly my father turned to me, trying to not show me the grave: «Do not go farther. You should not». I am only noticed, that the water in the creek was red and crows flied up There was so many crows, that I shouted And my daddy can not eat for several days. And if he spotted crow, then he run home and he was all trembling, just like he had some fever... Nina Yaroshevich, 9 years old«German truck stopped near our home. I think it was made not intentionally, but because of some fault with the truck. Soldiers got into our home and send me and my grandma away and they compelled my mother to help them... Night fell and it was dark. Suddenly my mom breaking into the room, took me by the hand and run from home. Our yard is empty, and we did not know, where we can hide. And we crawled under the truck They came from home after us, but they did not find us. Mom was lying on me and I heard her teeth clattering... In the morning we returned to our home, after Germans leaved it. We entered home and found our grandma on the bed. She lied, tied to it Naked! Grandma... My grandma... I shouted in fear and mom expelled me from home. And I shouted and shouted and can not stop...» Luda Andreeva, 5 years oldThey took 13 children, everyone they managed to find and set us in the head of the convoy because they were afraid of the mines, set by partisans. We walked and they ride after us on tracks. If they need water, they send one of us. Boys were not afraid, but girls cried. I remember it was early spring and we were barefoot Germans walked around the village, entering all homes in turn and they herd all parents, they suspected that thy have children fighting as partisan... And they behead them in the center of the village... They ordered: «Look». They did not find anyone in one house and they caught and hanged their cat. It pouched like little child». Luba Alexandrovich, 11 years oldThere were 6 persons in our home: grandma, mom, my olden brother, me and my two younger brothers... I looked in the window and found that they were heading to our neighbors. Me and one of my brothers run into the mud room and fasten the door by hook. Then we sat on to the chest near our mother. The hook was feeble and German broke it in one moment. He overstep the threshold and shoot at us salvo fire. I had not time even to discern, is he young or old. All of us fell onto the floor and I fell behind the chest... When I came back to consciences, I feel something dropping on me It was dropping and dropping, just like water. I raised my head and found that it was my mother's blood and mom is lying killed. I crawled under the bed and all the floor was covered by blood. And I was wet of blood... Leonid Sivakov, 6 years oldThey did not shoot outdoors, they entering homes. We stayed near the window, watching: — Here they go, to shoot Aniska... — They finished with Aniska family, and coming to aunt Anfisa... And we stayed, waiting, when they will come to us. We do not cried, no one of us. We just stayed... I remember, how my mothers hair burned and napkins of my little brother... We crawled from them with my olden brother, in to the yard, then – in to the bushes, in our kitchen garden. And only there I started to cry....» Tonya Rudakova, 5 years old«I saw something, the human being can not see. He must not... The previous night someone throw the train off the rails and in the morning Germans put the people, who worked on railway on the rails and set another train to go on them I watched, how they knocked children from the hands of their mothers by bayonet and throw them into the well... I watched our neighbor's dog crying. It sat on the ashes left of their home. All alone...» Yura Karpovich, 8 years oldWe lived in the Mehovaya village in Orel region. They took us from there and make move afoot to Byelorussia. They punch us from one concentration camp to another. When Germans wanted to take me to Germany, my mom made a false belly for her and gave me my little brother. So they crossed me out of their list... There were children, torn by dogs. We just sat over the one such baby and wait, when he or she stop breathing. Then we cover baby by snow and here is the grave until next spring... And we go to the next baby, to check is he still alive or not...» Anya Pavlova, 9 years old",9,5,7,19 November 2010
Mission: Impossible III," The first mission was stylish at least
","But this one just boring. As usually everything went wrong, but then, great American spy saved the world. Bullshit. Crappy fairytale. CIA, FBA, NSA, and 16 other terrorist organizations, established by US government... what had they brought to the world? Only wars, poverty, economic disasters, tortures, corruption, famine, new diseases. And drugs, of course, the hell lot of drugs. Trained murderers, they are traveling all around the world and destroying future of the mankind. It is funny to watch this scum feeling nostalgia for humanity, for innocence, trying to show love. It is impossible for them to become human beings again. They are traitors of their humanity, they can not live like that, they will die very soon.",4,2,4,29 June 2010
Casablanca," Weak plot
","That is just preposterous! Some bourgeois fighting Hitler… hehehe… in bar and… hehehe… dreaming only about leaving for US. Absolutely naive American look on the situation in Europe. This plot is not interesting and is not possible in real life. I do not know anything about American intelligence nets in occupied Europe, but if Germans only knew that Laslo have any information about resistance leaders in so many countries, then: 1) he would never escape his confinement in Germany (or all Europe, including south France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland and north Africa); 2) he would never save his secrets from Nazi SD specialists. If you want, I can recommend 'Vyzyvaem ogon na sebya' – absolutely REAL story of 18 years old girl and she is a REAL hero.",6,5,16,30 September 2008
