The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Mind blowing but not quite like the previous two
","I was quite impressed by this movie and was surprised by the number of negative comments on IMDb. Still, reading through such reviews you see that most complaints are about 'lack of action' and 'nothing happening' in this third Hunger Games installment. This is definitely correct - the movie contains much less of 'slash and smash' and suspense type of moments than the previous two titles. However, this is also exactly what blows your mind if you don't start watching it set on a suspense filled clash in life-or-death setting. What does blow you away is the development in the movie of the pain and hopelessness of the people of the Districts pitted against ruthless and inhumane actions of the Capital and president Snow. The movie develops in quite an orthogonal direction from the previous two titles, and this indeed rubbed a lot of HG1-2 fans the wrong way. In short, the movie does not contain excessive amount of action or breath-taking developments, but connects on a deeper and emotional level to show the things about Panem that did need to be shown. Don't come set for a suspense/action flick, and you will be rewarded with a deep and rich experience.",9,1,13,2 January 2015
Lone Survivor," Excellent movie must watch
","Contain spoilersI'd give this movie 8.5 stars but have to round up out of the absence of half grades. The movie is very solid and based on a strong real story. I certainly would recommend watching this to anyone, any audience. The movie is superb but itself is a soul wrenching horror story that shows how the price of incompetence in war is death. I was seriously motivated by the movie to get this off my chest here. It's hard to imagine a more horrendous pile up of tactical mistakes made by the SEALS and the rescue mission. I have no beef with the decision to release the hoarders by the SEALS, there was really no choice as this indeed was bound by the rules of engagement. But to not try to tie everyone up and release just the oldest - and the slowest - hoarder, thus getting more time to escape or hide. Or openly argue about the direction of retreat and just go there then and wait, instead of changing direction to try and get lost in the woods, fully realizing they would be followed shortly after. Or giving up high ground in a fight (although there SEALs might had no choice already). Or performing air drop in a clear war zone without trying to generate any kind of suppressing fire, even by firing own firearms, knowing plain and square there is Taliban on the ground, like it was a picnic hike. And not following up with a search for survivors, if any (where is the 'no one gets left behind' of the US Army we hear so much about in Hollywood blockbusters?). And finally the worst of them all - not taking up a defensible position while it was abundantly clear that the clash with Taliban was extremely likely. In aftermath while watching the things unravel horrendously, it appears that every single decision that had to be made was made wrong by the company leaders, and the loss of life is horrendous. The operation itself is a disaster, with 19 marines dead. The only thing you can say while watching this is Oh My God. Very sad and painful.",9,0,1,16 February 2015
