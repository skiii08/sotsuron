Minority Report," I went to see it because of Philip K Dick.
","I've read several PKD novels, and let me tell you, they are an excellent challenge.  Insightful, dark, ambiguous (amTRIguous?)and ultimately humane.  Sometimes his work seems deliberately unclear, but it is never short of compelling.With Minority Report, Mount Spielberg has created a film of consummate craftsmanship.  Noir bathed in light and white all over.  Wow!  Sort of the negative print of Blade Runner.  Nothing escaped Spielberg's attention, not the minutest detail, nor texture nor athmospheric.  A very convincing representation of the Police State that the United States could become (remember how everybody got face-scanned at the last Super Bowl?).  The choreography and pacing of action sequences are, yet again, masterful and fresh;  credit must be given to Spielberg for consistently pulling this off, year in and year out.  Which reminds me:  What a travesty it was to integrate the Schwarzenegger Element to another PKD project:  Total Recall. The plot reflects PKD's forte:  the permutation of ideas both visionary and unexpected.  However, the wishy-washy ending torpedoes everything that the rest of the film stands for.  What could have been a great film becomes merely a good one, because of the saccharine aftertaste.The factor that makes Blade Runner great is its conviction to bring forth the true spirit of PKD to the very end, to its logical lack of conclusion.  Many people remember that Blade Runner hit the screen in 1982 with an infamous watered-down ending, patched in at the prompting of studio executives, a sort of commercial bowdlerization, and a woeful mistake long since corrected.Now, Mount Spielberg has here shown yet again that he cannot help but to bowdlerize himself.  Could somebody please tell this man to stop pushing the same blatant sentimentality buttons that served him (and us) well once upon a time, once or twice?  And that goes double for Mr. Cruise.'It's too bad she won't live, but then again who does?'",Null,0,0,27 July 2002
The Big Lebowski," The Greatest Story Ever Told.
","I, as you, dear reader, probably do too, make it a point to sit aroundthe fireplace with my children and their children's children duringthe holidays, eating candied yams and watching The BigLebowski.  It's a family experience that bonds us ever closer eachpassing year.  We laugh in sorrow and weep in joy.It's got it all!  German nihilists that don't believe in anything! Androgynous flamenco bowlers!  Flying femenist avantgardepainter people!  Smut videos with exotic accents filmed in gloriousvideo!  Furry little mammals in harnesses!  White Russians madewith powdered milk!  Iron lungs!  Photos of farmhouses just a bitwest from way out in the middle of nowhere!Witness the Dude get kicked around from one limo into another. Feel the bubbles caressing your back as the bathtub turns into awhirlpool.  Learn a thing or two from the Dude on how NOT tobarricade yourself at home.  Grab hints from the Dude as how tosqueeze the most out of your Walkman on those lonely weeknights.  And above all, appreciate the value of being polite tocab drivers, because, you know, they are people too, with feelings.Yes ma'am, The Big Lebowski has got it all, hanging together as aroom does when there's a nice carpet laying about.  Anepistemology lesson in easy to swallow pink tablets, a musicalextravaganza that puts any old C-Span book signing broadcast toshame, a buzzard flapping its' wings in Nevada and creating ablanket of fog over London, The Big Lebowski is all this, andmaybe just a little bit more, but don't quote me on that one.Just one thing, though.  Does the Dude really have to cuss somuch?For consistently putting me in a cheery mood, lower to mid ninesout of ten.",Null,0,1,16 December 2003
A Bridge Too Far," In a dead heat with Thin Red Line, still the best WWII film.
","I saw this on the very same day I saw Star Wars.  Then a month later, I did it again, ABTF and SW on the same day.  I've made it a point to watch ABTF every few years from then on, and wow, it's a damn fine flick, isn't it?It was a series of firsts for me, I can't speak for anybody else: For the first time, we don't get the soldier clutching a bloodless wound and dying a quick, tidy, glorified, recruitment office approved, old Hollywood death. For the first time, we get insight into the interminable waiting by civilians like you and me, followed by a blinding ray of hope, followed by indescribable horrors. For the first time, we get a sense of the hellish logistical maze that major military operations must work out, compromising itself and the lives of thousands of men, because of an appalling lack of vision by some petty official ('We'll land you 10 miles out of town, since we cannot afford to loose a single glider'). For the first time, we see how the little details can do the biggest operations in ('It seems, sir, that the radios have been supplied with the wrong crystals'). For the first time, we see the astounding stupidity of mankind (that's the race I belong to, I'm sometimes ashamed to say) taking the form of Volksgrenadier boy soldiers. And  the paratrooping sequence.  The artillery shells coming closer and closer.  The construction of the Bailey bridge.Any weak elements of the film are overwhelmed by sequences such as these. Furthermore, it is to Cornelius Ryan's gigantic credit that he shows, in both TLD and ABTF, german officials as genuinely human, as opposed to caricatures.  Spielberg STILL succumbs to this childlish temptation. Just a couple of thoughts:1.  Gen. Gavin (Ryan O'Neal) is not necessarily too young to be a General. During wartime, the size of an army balloons, red tape shrinks to a minimum, and gifted leaders can quickly achieve extremely high rank.  Accordingly, once war operations come to an end and the size of an army deflates, to compensate, many high ranking officials are demoted back to their pre-war rank. 2.  Somebody mentioned something about americans arriving at the end of WWI, therefore not having lived the full, debilitating horrors of trench warfare, as Montgomery did.  Fiddlesticks.  It was americans who invented trench warfare during the Civil War.  If european generals had bothered to study the american military experience, WWI would have ended much sooner. What the american army did in 1917, when on the offensive for the first time, was attack in ZIG-ZAG with many flexible units, instead of full frontal assaults right at pillboxes with machine guns.  Thus, american tactics quickly sent dumbfounded germans reeling into defeat. Some films have to be three hours long, and this is one of them.  Any way you look at it, ATF is a thrilling, horrifying, thought- provoking, all around excellent film.   A grand slam. Now where's the definitive Russian Front epic, the life and times of Andrei Zhukov, Grand Marshall of the Soviet Union? Now THERE'S an epic, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad and Berlin, clocking in at just under four hours, whaddya say?",Null,0,1,11 December 2003
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," The BBC miniseries was perfect, why this? Or so I thought.
","When I found out a film version of TTSS was coming out, I got angry. TTSS was already perfectly executed as a story by the BBC, I have the DVDs, Sir Alec Guinness was already perfect as George Smiley. Why cram and 'Hollywoodize' a 2-hour version of something that was already perfect at 12 hours?Then I saw the film and was astounded on every single possible level that matters. As of today, if I'm surfing channels and TTSS is playing, I put the remote control aside and joyfully watch this work of art over and over again.Excellence. The best film I've seen since 'The Lives Of Others' and 'The New World'.",10,2,5,19 January 2014
Barry Lyndon," This is the only Kubrik review I will ever do in IMDb.
","I consider Kubrik to be the greatest film director of them all.  I have seen every film of his starting from Killer's Kiss onward.  After tonight, the only film of his I have not seen at least twice is Killer's Kiss (which I had the good fortune to find playing in a film theatre only two blocks away from my hotel room in Paris).Barry Lyndon only confirms my beliefs.  Kubrik IS the greatest (sorry, Cassius).  Kubrik always respected my ability to interpret, to think and uncover, to rise to the challenge.The pacing of Barry Lyndon is intoxicating, taking its' time to explore what otherwise would be blink-and-miss at the hand of the majority of film directors, Russians like Eisenstein and Tarkovsky excluded.  The lighting and usage of musical score are in a Universe of their own, comparable to nothing else ever done, outside rank or classification.  The complexity of storytelling navigates in shades of grey, leaving as villains only circumstance and poor judgement by the characters involved, an approach sorely missed in MOST of modern cinema, where melodrama seems to be the order of the day.  While Barry Lyndon is a film with morality, it is by no means moralistic.In short, Barry Lyndon very much reflects real life, presented as a unique and grand cinematic experience.  My only regret is that I have not seen this film on a 90mm proyector screen, where it belongs.Thank you, Stanley.  I treasure the king's ransom of art that you left us and miss you every day.",Null,2,4,24 June 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Should be regarded as part of a whole.
","Most people I know loved the original Matrix for its originality.  I,having read quite a bit of science fiction, did not find the storyparticularly fresh, but it was an original CINEMATIC experience, upuntil the point when they turned Schwarzenegger on us in thatlobby.  I was really enjoying it until that last third marred it for me. For my money, EXistenZ executed a much more satisfyingconclusion with a similar subject.Many people I know hated Matrix Reloaded because it did notrepeat their epiphany of the original Matrix.  Maybe they also expectto be dazzled anew by the unexpected twists of Fight Club Part II: Fight Harder.   Whatever.  I found Reloaded to be a bold statementand loved it, as I tend to prefer the tone and tempo of the middlemovement in three part symphonies (i.e.,  Empire Strikes Back,The Godfather).So come noon, I was in the cinema on the day of the premiere ofRevolutions.  Right off the bat, I was incredibly relieved:  no Ewoks,thank God.  Just pure visual heavy metal of the highest caliber. Some loose ends left so, as they were sideshows (expect a bunchof novels with the Merovingian soon).  Some awkward verbalelaborations on faith, personal destiny and existentialistphilosophy (handled better, methinks, in the final episode of NeonGenesis Evangelion).  An unfolding individual tragedy that pulls nopunches.  An ambiguous ending, a first step, worthy of Ballard orPhilip K. Dick, messy as life itself, in an epic sci-fi setting.  No cop- out this is.If you want your cherry on the cake with frosted coating and aCeline Dion tune as the credits roll, go watch a Tom Cruise flick orsomething.  But The Matrix Trilogy, overall, is ambitious, flawed,noble and worthy.",Null,0,0,8 November 2003
Duck Soup," Short but sweet. Spoilers ahead.
","Clocking at 68 minutes, Duck Soup ended a bit too quickly for me.I really enjoyed this film, shortcomings nonwithstanding:  Very poorediting in some spots, a couple of gags are poorly constructed orare orphaned halfway through.However, there are three great set pieces:  The lemonade stand(parts 1 and 2), the mirror scene (pure genius) and the warsequence (packed with insane rapid-fire gags, Airplane!-style).I find it amazing just how much Looney Tunes ripped off fromthese guys.  Having grown up with Looney Tunes, Duck Soup is, ina manner of speaking, like going full circle and finding myselfhome again.Another thing I really like about Duck Soup (or any Marx Brothersfilm) is Harpo, doing his silent movie character in a worldsurrounded by sound.  This creature from another era gives asurrealistic depth to the comedy offered on screen.It is said that Duck Soup's anarchic style is what makes it currentand relevant.  I beg to differ.  I rather think Duck Soup remainstimely because of 'We God's chillun an' we got guns, so let's go towar'.  Sounds absurd, doesn't it?  Well, it's how it happens, isn't it?How a people, any people,  can be whipped-up into a war frenzy forno excusable reason (such as Firefly's war-at-all-costs mentality),is the ultimate essence of this film.  The fact that Duck Soup doesthis in an absurd manner makes the observation easier to digest,putting up a mirror to us all without offending so easily with thetruth.  The message, in some level, makes its' way through.Tapping into universal truths and skewering them, Duck Soup wastimely when it was made, and remains timely today.",Null,0,0,3 August 2004
Apocalypse Now," There is no bigger artistic roll of the dice.
","I've made it a point to watch this film every seven or eight yearssince it came out.  I was all of twelve the first time around. Just tonight I was treated to the Redux.What a humongous scope!  To coherently cram this many resources in such an unforgiving environment is a testament toCoppola's crazed ego, stubborness and sheer flawed brilliance. No major studio today would touch this material with a ten footpole.  It would be watered down beyond recognition, to ensuresome targeted blah blah segments blah blah demographic.About the Redux: Every single restored scene adds, as opposed to distracts. Certain plot gaps, little ones, are now fulfilled.  I don't mindwatching this film for an extra hour, nor do I mind a discourse fromthe french perspective of Indochina, over a good dinner and wine. And thank you, Coppola, for jettisoning your alternate mom-and- apple-pie ending.But one thing I find unforgivable every single time around, and thatis the slaughter of the cow.  No sentient animal should EVER bekilled or made to suffer for art's sake, in the same way thatbullfighting goes against my every single principle. Yet bullfighting exists against my will, and Apocalypse Now makesme face that fact head-on, as a member of the human race, ofwhich I am often dismayed. Most probably this is a reflection of Coppola's disintegrating sanityapproaching the end of filming.  Apocalypse Now reflects thesame madness and hell that both cast and crew endured duringfilming.  One and the same skewed sense of integrity that flawsthis film so deeply but also makes it one of the monoliths by whichtwentieth century filmmaking will be regarded.  Forever.",Null,0,0,31 August 2002
Pi," Obtuse, infuriating and inspired content, virtuoso execution
","I saw Pi a couple of years back, it has run its course through my mind and settled there, as undisturbed as sediment at the bottom of a lake that is on its way to becoming rock.  These depths becon me every so often, and there I go, to revisit what I once knew. Guess what?  Pi is turning into a diamond down there, aging exceptionally well. To me, Pi was and is as challenging and satisfying as a really difficult crossword puzzle which, in interpretation, can fit many different words into the same spaces.  Pi jolted me out of complacency yet again and reshifted my paradigm about what art is and can do. Arofnosky, it becomes increasingly apparent with RFAD, is a brilliant director.  Thankfully, he's not alone, far from it.  Just not around multiplexes, mind you. KABOOM!  (Afterglow and fade out...)",Null,0,1,9 April 2002
Mulholland Drive," Curiously enough, Roger Ebert loved it.
","David Lynch shocked and awakened me with Blue Velvet, a hard act to follow. I have come to expect the unexpected from Lynch, so much so that I know exactly what's coming:  a twist.  It's like that Bugs Bunny cartoon in which the exasperated king cries out  'Every day it's the same thing... VARIETY!' Of course, there are plenty of tantalizing morsels in every varied meal, but my palate has become jaded with Lynch.  I am sure that Mr. Lynch realized this too.  This might be the reason why he cleansed his palate with the wonderful The Straight Story. So now, with Mulholland Drive, Mr. Lynch delivers his most subtle balance between the sublime and the madness. In a nutshell, the dream state.  Whereas Lost Highway is a nightmare that would awaken me perspiring halfway through, Mulholland Drive is like a long dream that fluctuates between the embers and the clouds, after which I wake up refreshed, with tears running down my cheeks and an intellectual afterglow, contemplating endless possibilities, even as my beloved dream irrevocably fades like a lifting fog to be lost forever.A few random observations: -I am willing to bet that Mr. Lynch has been struck by Robert Altman's latter work, specifically Short Cuts. -Angelo Badalamenti has become subtler, with greater impact. -David Lynch is becoming the first and truest of American surrealist filmmakers.  Someone we can be, and should be, proud of. -To compare Mr. Lynch with Federico Fellini is like comparing Jazz and Classical. -At best, Fellini makes me laugh while being mesmerized.  At best, Lynch abruptly makes me cry with a smile.Do I recommend Mulholland Drive?  Yes, very much.  But you'd better watch this film at least a couple of hours after your previous meal.  You do not want to be sluggish while watching this one.Kind regards from Mexico.",Null,0,0,27 October 2001

The Bourne Supremacy," Damn fine popcorn spy flick (minor spoilers)
","I've always been a fan of spy movies, for the same reason I like baseball, probably, to watch something that's complex and thoroughly inconsequential at the same time. To just sit back with some nachos, ice cream bon-bons, suspend all disbelief and have my brain tickled. Bourne Supremacy successfully delivers.Now, Bourne Identity was about a mystery in which we are digging deeper and deeper along with the main character. Bourne Supremacy cannot repeat this feat, nor should it, so the movie opts instead to be quite transparent about the plot and concentrate on the road towards payback. I really do enjoy how Mr. Bourne is ALWAYS a step ahead of the CIA pack, I smile at his unbelievable competence. I love the cosmopolitan settings in which the film takes place, more so than on the original Bourne Identity. And while not entirely able to disregard the laws of nature, I truly enjoyed the car chase, the first to acknowledge a post-'Matrix Reloaded' cinematic language, as the intense crescendo that it is.The only thing that put me off a bit was the editing (which worked fine for me elsewhere in the film), during the fight sequence, MUCH more thrillingly executed in Bourne Identity, where you can clearly observe the choreography of two precise, relentless killing machines going for each other's throats.Yes, Bourne Identity is a better, smarter, sharper film, as Doug Lyman is a superior director to Paul Greengrass, but Bourne Supremacy is pretty damn good, and quite a bit of pokerfaced escapist fun, to be taken with a grain of salt. Exactly what a spy flick should be. By the way, for a more serious example of the genre, check out 1973's 'The Day Of the Jackal', a superb piece of intelligent cinema.I am enthusiastic about the final installment of this adaptation of Robert Ludlum's trilogy, 'The Bourne Ultimatum', and I seriously hope that the studios will be wise enough to call it quits when that one hits the theaters.",Null,0,1,8 September 2004
