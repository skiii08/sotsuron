It," Horrible Movie
","Please! Don't waste your time or money. The teens acting is alright but the movies is horrible. There were no scary parts to make you jump and a lot of the movie is actually comical being so bad. The quality of the film and some effects are good, but you'll most likely be disappointed. I hardly ever go to a horror film and went because of a few reviews I read (first time going to a film by reading a review also). My wife is a horror film fanatic and said it was boring and terrible. Hope this is helpful.",1,15,29,13 September 2017
