The Blair Witch Project," Freaky, psychological thriller. I am hooked.
",Everyone who saw The Blair Witch Project with me was scared to death by the almost tormenting film.  I was much more than frightened by it.  I am now a Blair Witch follower.  I have ordered the Sci-Fi Channel documentary and I have the dossier book for the film.  Last week I went to Burkittsville and experienced an sensation of eerie glee from being in the place where Blair Witch Project was created.,10,1,2,9 August 1999
