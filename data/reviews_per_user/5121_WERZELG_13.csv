Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ham acting. Dull plot, no emotion.
","In this 'smash hit' which is low on everything including genuinely exciting action we are given cardboard, one dimensional characters, awful direction, awful camera work, and quite frankly, shocking casting, we see a plot which could put anyone to sleep and little to no expansion on the original trilogy.                                                         I am sick of modern directors who use effects to win the audience over. This film does not make us want the Jedi to win. Darth Maul is a complete stranger who does nothing to make us hate him. It would have been much better if we had started off with three Jedi Knights and we had got to know the third one until the evil Darth Maul comes along and mercilessly kills him. Instead you can't help rooting for him in the end. As well as an awful script the acting from Natalie Portman and Ewan Mcgregor. They seemed embarrassed to say their lines, who can blame them. Onto Anakin Skywalker. An awful character and damnably annoying. I was reminded of Wacky Races more than Ben Hur. Yet because of Liam Neeson's performance and Jar Jar Binks. I will give this a six out of ten. Maybe it is just because I am not into Sci Fi in the slightest but it can be entertaining probably for kids. I see this as one to miss.",Null,0,1,6 September 1999
Spartacus," KUBRICK AND DOUGLAS MADE ONE FINE TEAM.
",SPARTACUS is by no means without flaw but behind BEN HUR it is the most powerful Roman epic of all timeThe length of it wasn't annoying because not one second of it was boring. KIRK DOUGLAS leads the way as a humane slave who dreams of an end to slavery and oppression and his screen relationship with JEAN SIMMONS is simply beautiful because it follows them through thick and thin. The musical score is amazing and all of the main characters are played very well. CHARLES LAUGHTON and PETER USTINOV are a pleasure to watch.  In affew likable scenes it tells of the bonding between the slaves and their attitude towards ROME and its empire. The battle scene at the end could have been better but everything that happens after that makes this great.  This is without a shadow of a doubt one of the greatest romantic adventures ever to grace the big screen.,10,1,4,5 January 2000
Spartacus," Another epic set in Roman times
","Absolutely brilliant film, it has had the misfortune of being compared to Ben Hur but Spartacus is an epic and is easily one of the best films of it's time. Laurence Olivier is nothing special on this but it's great none the less.",10,0,2,7 September 1999
Citizen Kane," CITIZEN KANE
","Orson Welles' Citizen kane will never lose its significance. Orson Welles, Dorothy Comingmore and Joseph Cotton all give towering performances. The direction and the idea are simply ingenious and no successful film that has been made since doesn't owe at least something to Citizen Kane. Its place is with THE BIRTH OF A NATION and Sunrise as the most inspirational film of all time.  It also tells a story of riches and the importance of love and loneliness. It is all summed up in one word. REVOLUTIONARY",Null,0,1,4 March 2000
Gone with the Wind," PROBABLY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FILM OF ALL TIME.
","The first half is a harrowing recreation of the problems faced by women during the civil war, but after Scarlett's second husband dies it becomes a kind of soap opera. Okay, the score is probably up there ahead of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and BEN HUR and the four leading performances are among the best of all timebut I am still undecided whether to like it. Vivien Leigh plays the main character who may not be the most likable character in the history of fiction but sure makes the film fun to watch. The ending is probably my favourite of all time or at least one of them, that or IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE or CASABLANCA or BEN HUR. Clark Gable who was not around much until the last hour played an intriguing character in his usual laid back style. However, the only character who is completely likable dies at the end, seeing as the other characters include a damnably laid back officer, a manipulative witch(similar in many ways to Anne Baxter in ALL ABOUT EVE), and a simple minded servant with a squeaky voice. Leigh and De Havilland are what I'll remember this picture for.",Null,0,0,18 April 2000
Lawrence of Arabia," ONE OF MY FAVOURITE FILMS
",Unique in so many ways. David Lean's direction is easily among the greatest of all time. Peter O'Toole leads the way in a great performance of a grade A script. Only just losing out in the Best actor category to Gregory Peck.Playing a junior British officer who is sent to assess the situation and becomes the greatest British soldier of all time. Omar Sharif in the second lead role provides delightful support as his sober companion which set him to the stardom which gave him a part as Dr. Zhivago and the whole cast are a pleasure to watch. This film finds itself in my top 10 easily because of the mixture between wit and tragedy. One of the best films of the 60s.,Null,1,3,4 February 2000
Schindler's List," ONE OF MY FAVOURITE MOVIES.
","Schindler,s List is the only Steven Spielberg film that I've ever really taken seriously. Tht three title roles are all played to perfection and the black and white only adds to its documentary style. It captures the horrors of the holocaust from both points of view. Using both graphic violence and the dialogue between the Jewish victims to portray the insanity and horror. Ralph Fiennes performance has to be the best of them all because he shows that you don't have to be a monster to do  deeds of unspeakable evil. Ahead of Goodfellas, Forrest Gump and Fargo as the finest film of this decade.",Null,9,13,4 March 2000
Titanic," Manipulative schmaltz.
","For some reason, 2 and a half years on people still take this film seriously. 1. Why do they have the nudity scene? As a substitute for artistic quality although it is very nice. 2. Why did they cast Leo? Because how else would they attract female audiences? All they did was spend alot of money and got some sex appeal and the product was a goldmine of shallow sap. Okay, I understand that people might have got caught up in the hysteria at the time but surely people can now see all the cliches and sentimentality. Even the academy fell for it and gave this movie a richly undeserved best picture oscar. If you are looking for the definitive movie of the decade see SCHINDLER'S LIST, GOODFELLAS or THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION but please think twice before renting this mind-numbing schmaltz.",Null,3,5,27 June 2000
All Quiet on the Western Front," BRILLIANT ANTI WAR PICTURE
","One of the greatest films of all time. Far superior to such modern films as Saving Private Ryan. The battle scenes are impeccable and it tells in an outstanding way how their naive hopes failed them and tells alot about growing up. As opposed to other films, crane lifted camera is used instead of a man standing behind them like in Saving Private Ryan. The quality of the performances was extremely surprising because at that time there was alot of bad acting among young male performances. As well as being one of the most moving films of all time it is pretty entertaining for a masterpiece The characters can all be sympathised with including the misunderstood professor because propaganda and unnecessary patriotism were very common during the first world war. Without being particularly graphic it is still one of the most harrowing war films of all time. The scenes with the French civilian girls tells about the desparation and loneliness of war in a beautiful way",Null,0,2,5 January 2000
Paths of Glory," EVERY SCENE IS MEMORABLE
","Especially the end one, the battle scenes are spectacular, the generals are sadists, the privates are the victims and Kubrick is a genius. Not being a long film I can't think of one scene which I didn't love. There is little violence and it is very powerful and depressing. Amazingly Kirk Douglas, Stanley Kubrick and co. didn't even get any oscar nominations but there is no denying that this is one of the great war films of all time This is possibly in my top 10 definitely in my top 20   10/10",Null,0,0,16 January 2000
Ben-Hur," THE MILLENIUM MOVIE.
","The Cinematography, All Of The Performances, The Amazing Score, The Characterisation, The Deep, Meaningful Message Of Human Dilemma and Morality. Forgiveness and hate. This Film Is Perfect. Its Amazing Direction, Flawless Script And First Class Story Make This Better Than CITIZEN KANE or any film in the AFI TOP 10 (EVEN LAWRENCE OF ARABIA). This was ridiculously low in THE AFI TOP 100. 70 places behind THE WIZARD OF OZ and the overrated GONE WITH THE WIND. Unlucky BURT LANCASTER. BETTER THAN THE BOOK AND AWESOME.",Null,1,2,26 November 1999
The Wizard of Oz," DELIGHTFUL! FOR YOUNG AND OLD
",THIS TIMELESS CLASSIC IS THE CHILDREN'S ADVENTURE FILM PERSONIFIED. THERE IS SO MANY THINGS TO REMEMBER THIS BY AND SO MANY GREAT ONE LINERS IT IS QUITE SIMPLY UNFORGETTABLE. ONE OF THE BEST PARTS IS WHEN DOROTHY (JUDY GARLAND) IS FIRST MEETING THE BRAINLESS SCARECROW (RAY BOLGER) AND SHE SAYS 'IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A BRAIN YOU COULDN'T TALK' 'WELL SOME PEOPLE WITH NO BRAINS TALK AN AWFUL LOT' REPLIES THE SCARECROW. 'I SUPPOSE SO' NOT ONLY IS  THIS ONE OF THE BEST MUSICALS OF OLL TIME BUT ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER MADE. DON'T MISS!!!! 10 OUT OF 10,Null,0,1,7 September 1999
The Godfather," VERY GOOD.
","THE GODFATHER is definitely among the greats, no-one can argue that Marlon Brando's performance is astonishing. The script is brilliant and even the cameos are played to perfection. Although I wasn't as amazed as I expected to be on my first viewing I have come to love it. It is over detailed but the baptism scene is one of the greatest pieces of cinema of all time. This is not my number 1 though, my top 25 list looks a little something like this 1.BEN HUR 2.SCHINDLER'S LIST 3. GONE WITH THE WIND. 4. ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT 5.CITIZEN KANE 6. THE GODFATHER 7. CASABLANCA 8.THE GUNS OF NAVARONE 9.THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI 10.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST 11.
