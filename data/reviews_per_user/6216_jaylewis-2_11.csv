Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," see it anyway.
","I am writing this review at 3 AM, just having returned from the 12:01 showing on May 19.  That's right, I got tickets.  I didn't camp out, but I got tickets.Was it magnificent? not reallyWas it the best Star Wars yet? definitely notWas it a meaningful movies packed with symbolism? of course notWas the acting good? some of the worst I've seenDid I enjoy it? every minuteIt wasn't Shakespeare, but this movie served its purpose.  It entertained me.  The plot was intriguing even though I could predict the result of every single occurrence in the movie.  I won't spoil it for anyone with details, but it doesn't take a genius to spot Lucas' weak attempts at plot twists even before they occur.  The character development is miserable, and the insertion of the comic relief character Jar-Jar Binks was as irritating as the ewoks in Return of the Jedi.  Yet, I couldn't stop watching and I couldn't help but enjoy this movie.  For once, I will plead with critics to not read into this movie.  I am willing to give Lucas some slack when it comes to quality in his writing.  Critics should let this bad movie slide by because it's Star Wars, and unless you make it a point to pick it apart (something I like to do- see my review of Return of the Jedi), you will enjoy this movie.Will I sit on the edge of my seat until Episode II? No, but even if it is bad, I'll still see it.",7,0,0,19 May 1999
Memento," engrossing
",Takes a 'gimmick' and runs with it. Backwards filmmaking may not be the filmmaking technique of the future but it works quite well for Memento. This film is truly engrossing from start to finish and it make you want to watch it again to find out what the hell just happened!,10,0,1,10 September 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," a lousy conclusion
","Every time I tell people how horrible I thought Return of the Jedi was they give me this puzzled look and say, 'but it's Return of the Jedi! You can't hate Return of the Jedi!' However, this movie really bothers me every time I see it. The creativity of the first Star Wars made it a great movie, and the shocking twist in Empire made it quite possibly the greatest sequel ever. Yet this incredible scenario presented at the end of Empire was wasted in a movie full of rehash. First of all, could Lucas really come up with nothing better than a SECOND Death Star??! And just like the first one, the movie ended in an all out assault on it. Luke and Vader fought with light sabers (again!). Not to mention, in a desperate attempt to recapture the emotion created in the audience after Vader said his famous 'I AM YOUR FATHER', Lucas made Leia turn out to be Luke's long-lost sister. Give me a break! A little competition between Han and Luke might show some semblance of conflict among the good guys. Just because it's sci-fi doesn't mean it can't be somewhat realistic in character presentation. Vader's unmasking was disappointing. Instead of Lon Chaney unmasked as the phantom, we got Uncle Fester with acne. Carrie Fischer can't act worth $#\&*! Although I could go on and on, I'll give just one final reason. Three words: Ewoks! Ewoks! Ewoks! I hate those furry little muppet wannabes. They were added for one reason and one reason only, so Lucas could line his pockets by making Ewok stuffed animals, talking Ewok toys, Ewok lunchboxes, and even an Ewok TV show! The bottom line is, this is the most OVERRATED movie in the history of Hollywood!!!",4,30,59,25 October 1998
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick's worst
","I am a big Stanley Kubrick fan. A Clockwork Orange and Dr. Strangelove are two of my all-time favorite movies. However, I had to force myself to watch Barry Lyndon. It was three hours of my life that I'll never get back. The cinematography was outstanding, but the story was overrated and the plot was dull. I can usually appreciate movies for what they are, but it's unfair to expect anyone to sit through this movie and get anything out of it other than wasted time. 4/10 (it's only that much because of the cinematography and because it's Kubrick)",4,8,25,3 June 1999
Fargo," Mediocre
","I looked forward to seeing Fargo as I heard many great things about it.  As I usually am, though, I was disappointed.  I just never really understood what was so special about this movie.  The acting was good and very believable. The setting was believable as was the portrayal of the local people, but let's be honest, do acting and setting really make a movie great?  The problem lies in the script, which just isn't very good.  I found nothing at all unique about 'Fargo.'  It's just extremely mediocre.  I give it a five out of ten.",5,2,5,19 January 1999
Armageddon," Don't insult our intelligence, Hollywood!
","I'll be the first to admit two things, firstly that I am very critical of movies and second that I am a cynical person. I owe the first attribute to the fact that I've seen a lot of movies. And one reason that I'm cynical is movies like Armageddon. I hated this movie more than even 'Howard the Duck,' 'Surf Ninjas,' or 'Dracula: Dead and Loving It.' Why hate this movie? First of all, in a summer that featured masterpieces like 'The Truman Show' and 'Saving Private Ryan' plus good movies like 'There's Something About Mary,' '54,' and 'Deep Impact,' this piece of trash was the top-grossing movie. (By the way, 'Deep Impact' was a surprisingly good movie.) Second of all, it's rehash. I'm getting extremely tired of these disaster movies. This is the third '...there's an asteroid/comet heading towards earth!' movie released in the last two years. Aside from movies like 'Asteroid' and 'Deep Impact,' there have been similar theme movies as well. There was 'Volcano,' 'Dante's Peak,' and yes, I would even count 'Titanic' as the same genre. Third, we come to the movie itself. For lack of a better word, 'garbage' is the best description I can think of. It has a sappy Hollywood romance to appease the female viewers while at the same time, it has an equally stupid and unbelievable action part to keep the male viewers from being too bored. In this aspect, it is much like 'Titanic,' although at least 'Titanic' made some semblance of an attempt at a realistic presentation of the action sequences. 'Armageddon' was boring, unrealistic, and unoriginal while at the same time showing some of the most pathetic acting skills I've ever seen making it the absolute lowest of the low in my book. Hollywood knows just which buttons to push to create a movie that supposedly everyone will like while keeping the brain work to a minimum. It is a sad but true fact. On a scale of 1-10, this movie gets a 1, and it was lucky to earn that.",1,1,3,5 January 1999
Independence Day," absolutely HORRIBLE!
","I hated almost everything about this movie. It just sucked. Do they really expect us to believe that a crop-duster or the president would really be able to fly a state-of-the-art fighter plane?? This is just another case of good special effects, bad movie. I give it a 2/10.",3,2,5,18 January 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," Good, but overrated
","I'll give Lawrence of Arabia one thing.  It's one of the only three and a half hour movies that held my attention for the whole time (The Deer Hunter and The Godfather also held my interest).  The cinematography is outstanding and the plot is much better than average.  However, I cannot rank this movie among the top few (Citizen Kane, The Godfather, A Clockwork Orange).  It's top  100 caliber, but it's not one of the greatest.  The fact is, I've seen better.  This is not a movie that made me think.  The scenery was not a substitute for the lack of a great plot.  Also, Lean was too obsessed with the majesty of the desert.  I grew tired by the end of the film of the constant riding back and forth across it.  I found myself saying, 'Oh God! There they go again! Back across the desert with that infernal music playing!'  The music and the landscape never changed, so why make the movie THAT LONG?!  It could've been shorter and then the cinematography would've been considered even better because it might not have gotten so monotonous. I'd still give Lawrence an 8 out of 10.One last thing-  How did this completely British film make it into the AFI's 100 Greatest American movies??",Null,1,9,17 February 1999
Mission: Impossible II," Bond...James Bond. OOPS! Wrong movie, guys!
","What happened? I loved the tv series. I liked the first movie. The twists and turns kept me guessing until the end, and I had to go back and watch it again to truly get every detail. This movie wasn't a sequel to Mission:Impossible, not a sequel to the movie or to the tv series. It was a Bond movie. They'd should've just gotten Pierce Brosnan to play Ethan, changed a couple of names, and there it is, another bad Bond spy flick. I was disgusted at the ridiculously overdone action sequences. The fight scene at the end is laughable. Many in the theater I was in left before the end. Perhaps the most disgusting part of this film is Ethan's love interest. This is what makes it most like a cheesy Bond flick. Ethan meets girl, and within 10 minutes they're all over each other. Her character was supposed to be an expert thief, but she ends up being the dumb damsel in distress. Her thief skills NEVER EVEN COME INTO PLAY AT ALL!! Even the cool gadgets and technology weren't interesting this time around. The  exploding sunglasses at the beginning that were shown in slow motion as they blew up just seemed so cliche. This is the worst movie to come out since The Postman or Armageddon. Don't see this one. Save yourself some cash and go rent a movie. Anything is better than this disgusting work. I hope they lose a lot of money on this one. Maybe then they'll learn their lesson that they can't lure us in with expensive special effects and a really bad plot.",1,6,11,5 July 2000
A Clockwork Orange," one of my all time favorites
","This is a movie that makes you really stop and think.  It is true that it is a good movie in itself, but there is also a philosophical element in this movie.  It's about choices and free will and existentialism.  Does man have the right to take away another man's free will?  If man ceases to have free will, does he cease to be a man?  Then he is merely a clockwork orange, pleasing to the eye (orange), and yet perfect, a puppet of god or the devil that is as predictable as clockwork.  This movie has the potential to change your way of thinking.  'A Clockwork Orange' and perhaps 'The Truman Show' are the greatest movies ever made if one judges on the basis of how deep the movie is.  This is one of only two or three movies that I would give a ten out of ten.",10,0,0,17 January 1999
The Truman Show," a masterpiece
","I've watched quite a few movies over the years.  The friendly neighborhood Blockbuster Video people could probably retire on the money they've made renting to just me.  I've seen the entire AFI 100 and every critically acclaimed movies that I can find.  Even so, I'd have to say that The Truman Show is one of the greatest movies ever to come out of Hollywood.  It's a perfect film.  The acting is great, the screenplay is phenomenal, and it is a very deep and symbolic movie.  I've seen it seven times and I pick up something new every time I watch it.  Even the title character's name, 'Truman Burbank,' is oxymoronic and symbolic.  He is a 'true man' who is the product of Hollywood.  You can even spot a few allusions to the crucifixion when Christof tries to stop Truman from escaping by flipping his boat.  The depiction of a Utopian society reminded me of Alduous Huxley's 'Brave New World,' a world were freedom did not truly exist even though the citizens thought it did.  Why did they not do anything?  It's just like Christof said in a memorable and disturbing quote: 'We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.'  This cynicism is thrown at you one last time in the final scene of the movie.  Two security guards, upon realizing that the show is over, shrug and say, 'Hmm, it's over. Let's see what else is on' while stuffing their faces with pizza.  Likewise, viewers of this movie may see it and say, 'Hmm, it's over' without giving it a second thought, not realizing the significance of the movie.  Don't see this movie if you're not willing to think.  Don't see this movie if you're looking for a superficial, slapstick, screwball comedy like most of Carrey's other pictures (You'll be disappointed if that's what you're looking for).  See this movie if you are prepared to be challenged philosophically.  Along with 'A Clockwork Orange,' this is one of two movies that I have given a ten out of ten.",10,0,0,2 February 1999
