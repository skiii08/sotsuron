Marie Antoinette," My DH and I were Mesmerized by the good quality
","I felt so much like a young girl myself, how my younger life came rushing back to me with the portrayal of Ms.Kurnst as the Archduchess, the Princess, the Dauphine and the Queen. Kirstin was perfect, her face so radiantly beautiful, and no guile there. I am surprised that the royal family got her to do tedium things at all...So, the more bravo to MA.I thought I died and went to heaven, to the costuming of the 18th century, Rococo heaven. I wanted to touch, to look at the stitches and embroidery and the undersupport of each and every costume. I wanted to feel the silk, since I knew it was silk, the way the gowns floated, were coloured and broke on the creases. I was mesmerized by the folds and the ruffles, the incredible sheer amount of work, professional and authentic recreation that went into every scene. I particularly enjoyed the blue shoes in the closet....Her little black pugs'name was 'Eggplant', 'Aubergine' in French! She looked just like a little fat dog, a little fat eggplant.DH already asked me if I want this film on DVD and you betcha! What I would like to find is a book of sets and costumes and their descriptions from the wardrober. Maybe I will write and ask for them.The filming was first rate. Some of the scenes seemed a bit underlit, even though they were shot outside. Others were bright. I found the beauty of the place was overwhelming. I was in total shock at the immensity of Versaille, and the immensity of the ch√¢teau de Versailles. This is the first time France has ever allowed free rein to shoot there, and boy does it have that POW factor. That is not paintings on the walls, people, that is actual woven silver and gold and blue fabric made for her, with her cipher woven in all over the castle, on chairs, cement swirls, windowsills, everything.I don't think I will ever be able to view Versaille in person, so this was the closest that I can, and it was so different from seeing it in photos and books. I really got a sense of perspective, and depth. I saw for the first time the 100 foot high hedges, and the Neptune fountains. I liked the quietness of Versaille, and it was so secluded from the outside world.I don't think MA was spoiled, she was just lonely and wanting to fit in with the crowd, and having fun. So she gambled away her jewelry, clothing and money. She had to make it up in the long run, and she did. She reformed the household, but it was a little too late for the French people. Poor Louis was such a stumbler, all these 'ifs' and the royals would still be in like Flynn yet. (possibly).Where did her little son go? I thought I had studied that he was sent to live with a bourgesoise family and made to live a paupers life, but he was still known as Louis XVII, who did have heirs, but where are they? Not in Burks Peerage. I vote this film for Oscars for screenplay, sheer delight and movie ability to transport the viewer to within its realm, Many Oscars for costuming and wardrobe and scenery, set direction, props....Bravo Bravo Bravo. I loved this movie a lot. I am tired of typical movies. Hurrah to Sofia Coppola!!!! love, sheri williams",10,2,7,24 October 2006
