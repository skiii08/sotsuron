Men in Black 3," a very good sequel
","I am a huge fan of men in black.i have even seen the animated series.they humor,plot and interesting special effects.The first two films were excellent and the third which i saw yesterday is something else really.The story is about time travel and the year 1969 an important date for all humanity because in that year humans landed on the moon.We see a new enemy and a new agent O who is the boss of the organization because the old one is dead.The story goes like this:An alien prisoner has escaped from the prison in moon and hunts agent Key because in 1969 he arrested and cut his arm.But what he is trying to do is to go back in time and kill the young agent key before he arrested him and change of course the course of time.Back in the present the only one who remembers agent key is agent James (Will Smith) who will try to go back in time and save his colleague.But the fact that agent James can remember agent key is not a coincidence because they have developed a special bond between them that is going to be explained at the finale. Tommy Lee Jones has a small part on the film but the younger image of him Josh Brolin is incredible because he follows the acting of Tommy Lee Jones.Will Smith of course once again was excellent and Emma Thompson as agent O and i must not forget to mention the younger character that plays agent O in 1969 Alice Eve a young but a promised talented person.Barry sonenfield follows a weird story that ends with an unexpected finale.Though i cannot compare it with the previous films i believe it is a good choice to watch especially in 3D experience.",8,5,12,24 May 2012
Skyfall," Definetaly a different James Bond film
","Skyfall is the new adventures of secret agent 007 James Bond.In his 50th anniversary he brings excitement,action and suspense clues that we had not seen a while on previous version.SAm Mendes the director of this film did a great job.He managed not only to present new persons that could fit in the story but an unexpected ending which in my personal opinion it is a reboot of 007 adventures.We may see in the future the old films remade by other directors.Judi Dench is wonderful again as M though her death in the film was not so expected.Ralph Fienes is great and the surprise is Berenice Marlohe a pretty French woman for whom i am sure in the future we act in great films.Of course the perfect bad man Javier Bardem the evil of the film very well played.Many great actors play also very notable.The story starts with a failed mission in Instanbul where 007 get shot ed accidentally by a secret agent Eve Mannipeny yes thats right the famous secretary of previous James Bond films where the MI6 service believes he is dead he shows up after the terrorist attack against the headquarters of MI6.After that the action is full with scenes from Japan,London's downtown and in my opinion the great finale where the new M after the death of Judi Dench is covered by Ralph Fienes.This scene is like a dejavu from the past.Great work they were right those who stated that this might be one of greatest Jame's Bond films ever made.My wish i hope the next one is much better than Skyfall.Until then enjoy this film.",8,3,14,4 November 2012
It," A very scary film but the ending could have been better
","It is a movie that is based in Stephen King's book with the main character a deadly clown named Pennywise and 7 children in a small town in Dery Maine.It is 27 years after the TV series version of It and i have to admit that it is much different from the original TV version and the book with good and bad facts.The main character Pennywise is excellent such as the children who play Bill,Richie,Eddie,Beverly,Mike,Stanley,Ben and of course Henry Bowers.What it is different is the character of Beverly Mars though she is great she is different from the novel and TV version and her relationship with her father who is treating her very badly.Henry bowers's father is killed by him though in the novel he is simply mentioned and in the TV version he is not mentioned at all.In the movie Mike has lost his parents in a fire but in the novel there is a mention about his parents and a chapter between him and his father.Georgie who is bill's brother who is killed by the Pennywise in the novel his dead body was found both in the novel and the TV version but in the movie it was never found only his jacket at the end of the film.Eddie has broke his hand but in the TV version was just mentioned,in the novel there is a whole chapter in a hospital and of course the fact that four from the seven children already knew each other and were friends.The novel contains much facts about the origin of It such as the environment in which was living and the turtle which is just mentioned in the film,in the TV version was not concluded but as the director said the turtle will play a vital role in It chapter 2.The disappointment is that the viewers will have to wait until 2019 to see the new movie but in general terms and despite the differences it was an excellent story with very scary scenes and the good acting of Pennywise and the children who look like the kids in Stranger Thing TV series i truly believe it is worth to see it.",10,2,3,6 October 2017
Star Trek," great action combined with a good story
",I remember when i was a kid to see Star Trek the TV-show from the 1960s.The adventures of Enderprise with Captain Kerk and Dr Spok.when i first heard that a new Star Trek film is going to come out in the cinema i thought it would be a boring film nothing more.But after i read that J.J. Abrams is going to write and direct the film i said the success is guaranteed.And i did not fall out.It has a great story very clever the actors were great and the action fights are incredible especially if you had the chance to see this on 3-D experience.The film really brought me back a lot of good memories.I cannot wait to see the next sequel from which i read the the director will be the same.,8,0,2,10 September 2012
Dunkirk," An excellent war film
","Christopher Nolan made it again.The director of memento,dark knight trilogy,inception and interstellar is in my modest opinion among the greatest directors such as Spielberg,Cameron,Scott,Scorsese e.t.c Dunkirk is a war film which the scenario depends upon the real events that took place from 26 may-4 June 1940 the famous battle of Dunkirk with the successful evacuation of 300.000 British soldiers from the Nazi's troops.The reason why it is unique is that it is the first war film about the second world war which is referring to an event that occurred at the beginning of the world war 2 and not the end.The second reason this film is referring to real events from the famous Commander Charles Lightoller who managed to evacuate thousands of British wounded soldiers from the mole of Dunkirk.The last reason is the action scenes which were very realistic and not to forget the great acting by Tom Hardy who plays a pilot for the British royal air force,Kenneth Branagh as Commander Bolton and of course Mark Rylance as Mr.Dawson.What it is not to be compared is with movies saving private Ryan,Schindler's list,the pianist,fury,inglorious bastards because it is something different.I wouldn't say that it is a masterpiece or one of the best Nolan's movies but it is a movie that someone should see.",10,3,11,7 September 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," a great film
","This new version of spider-man is different from Sam Reimi's films.There is no Mary Jane but Gwen,The gift of spider was achieved different from the first film.But one thing i can add is that the new actor who plays spider man is much better than Tobey Maguire.i hope we can see a sequel soon.In 3-d is a great experience.The new enemy is the Lizard a giant lizard and about an experiment with DNA.The scenario was good there were great moments of laugh and sadness.Martin Seen as Uncle Ben was good although his appearance was small in the film but he plays an important role so as Sally Field as Aunt May.Finally we learn some stuff about Peter Parker's parents and what happened to them.A good try in a few words.",8,1,3,15 July 2012
Revolutionary Road," a great performance by DiCaprion and Winslet
",When i first heard about the film i would not expect to be so good.And the main reason is the actors.When i heard Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet would be the main stars of the film i immediately remember Titanic and i could not combine these two people in any other film.But i was wrong.The film is excellent.There is an obvious chemistry between Dicaprio and Winslet whom in my personal opinion are much better than in Titatic without of course to turn down the film of 11 Oscars this performance seemed to me more real.Of course it locates the relationships between young couples in 1950s and the problems they had basically with the stereotypes of the society.Though i wish it had a happy ending not that this one was bad but i expected a happy ending for the couple.Otherwise it is a good choice to watch and learn important things about human relationships and how to deal with them.,10,0,1,6 August 2012
Gone Girl," An incredible movie by Fincher
","I watched it last night and in my opinion it deserves an Oscar.A movie that changes its plot all the time including the power of journalism the nightmare of unemployment,the lies of the couples and of course the money.The general story is about a couple that lives in Michgan and have many problems with their wedding plus both of them with no jobs.Ben Afflek's character is a man who hates his wife because she is popular,has money but her character is so pathetic and that why she does not have any friends.On the other hand Amy cannot deal with the fact that they move from New York to a village and jealous the fact that her husband doesn't pay attention.And one day she disappears and of course the primary suspect is Ben Affleck.But later we see that all this was organized by her in order to avenge him because she was having an affair with a younger woman.But the most great part of the movie is the unexpected ending.All actors were excellent even Neal Patrick Harris who had a smaller role but very significant.Rosamunde Pike was also good and i have no words for Ben Affleck's performance and the rest of the actors.I would say one of the best films of 2014 and a masterpiece of David Fincher.",10,5,16,9 October 2014
Dark Shadows," Not bad at all
",When i heard Tim Burton was going to make a new film i was so excited.i am a huge fan and i enjoy his films very much especially batman returns and big fish are my favorites.And the title is so mysterious Dark ShadowsWhen i read the plot i realize it is going to be the classic Tim Burton film with Johnny Depp as main star and Helena Bonem Carter.The other cast is very good.Personally i distinguish Michelle Pfeiffer and Chloë Grace Moretz and Eva Green as Angelique Bouchard who has a love for Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp).This film has all these characteristics like any other Tim Burton's films.You will find it much more funnier that the previous film of Tim Burton's (Alice in Wonderland).Personally i believe that he has a good way to tell a story without getting bored that combines it with good music and graphic scenes.Trust me you must see it you will not regret i cannot wait to see his next film.,8,7,15,1 September 2012
Finding Dory," A great sequel-Well done Disney-Pixar
","Finding Dory is a great sequel which combines excellent the first story with the story of Dory who tries to find her parents but unfortunately Dory suffers from amnesia but there is her new family Marley and his son Nemo who will help her travel to California to an institute where dory believes there they live her parents but something went wrong and they will split but with the help of an Octupus,a whale and a dolphin Dory will catch up withe Marley and Nemo but also Dory will find her family.Amazing animation,a very good story which combines humor and realism,it seems when there is a cooperation between Pixar and Disney miracles happen and not by luck.Through the years we have seen great pictures such as Finding Nemo,Toystory,Wall-E,Monsters co etc.I wish we could see in the future great films as well.Well done Disney-Pixar and thank you for another great film.",10,2,8,20 November 2016
Prometheus," Have you seen it?Not yet?Then go
","Prometheus is the most waited film of the year.In Prometheus we expect to get answers about the space jockey and the xenoform.And at one point Ridley Scott has managed it.He is triggering with questions like where do we come from?what is our purpose?He gives a deeper meaning to the film.The film starts with a mysterious alien form (in the film we know them as Engineers) from whom we were created.This creature decides to leave hints so later mankind come in contact.And this is what happened.After a 2 year journey Prometheus reached its destination to LV-223 where a team of explores decide to investigate a mysterious pyramid where above are the engineers fossilized for unknown reason and they took a sample back to the ship.A sudden storm forces 2 members of Prometheus to stay back where both of them will be attacked by a mysterious small life form which has the same characteristics with the Xenoforms from alien and they both die.Back on Prometheus an android called David puts a genetic material on Charles Holloway and he gets infected without knowing it.And he is going to pass it to Elizabeth Shaw an embryo of the first form of Xenoform.Furthermore,David knows exactly what was the purpose of Engineers.They created the Dna of the Xenoform so they can kill the whole humanity but for an unknown reason they lost the control and there is an Engineer alive but frozen.The final battle will be between Elizabeth,Engineer and The Xenoform (do not compare it yet with the alien) where from this battle will rise the form of the Alien as we know from the films.There are many similarities between Prometheus and alien.The planet is not the same (LV-426 was in alien)but the main idea is the same.We get to know why these things were created,what was the purpose only to find out the human factor has played an important role in the story.A total different experience in 3D believe me you wont regret.Although it is not a direct prequel it has those characteristics with the alien franchise.I mean if Ridley Scott decided to make a direct prequel i believe it would be a total failure like AVP movies.Prometheus presents a new kind of science fiction and i hope in the near future we can see a sequel but i wish it would be from a great director.And don't forget that David mention that there are other space jockeys around the galaxy.If you ask me which of two i prefer i would alien because it is a classic film but Prometheus gives another aspect a new kind of franchise.",10,7,19,6 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Amazing but not quite so
","The Dark Knight Rises film i am sure it would be the hit of the year.A film we expected to come out after the huge success of the previous film The Dark Knight.In my opinion i choose The Dark Knight rather than this new movie.The reason is simple.The previous film was much darker and violent than this one.Of course Bane the evil man is incredible and better than Batman and Robin of Joel Schmacher but still i prefer Joker's performance.It takes out feelings,anger characteristics more human.Heath Ledger made his best performance better from Jack Nicholson.Anne Heathway as Catwoman is good but not so good as Michele Pfeifer in Batman Returns of Tim Burton's.Another disadvantage was the length of the movie.It is more than 2 hours and in some moment you feel bored.And the ending it did not have to be so confusing.It could be simpler.In the end the film was great in action,great acting and scenario.It has these turn overs specifically in the end where we learn Miranda Tate is the daughter of Raul Gaul from Batman Begins.Marion Cotillard is great as Miranda Tate so as Joseph Lovitt as Blake or perhaps Robin?It is good that Christopher Nolan decided to end the trilogy of the Dark Knight.It would spoil the meaning of new adventures of Batman.Thank God he created these films by himself.",10,0,3,18 November 2012
Monsters University," an excellent sequel
","Disney made its miracle again.The new version of Monsters is clever,funny,pithy at some scenes and much different than the previous film.We see these two heroes of the first film in the university where at first they did not get on well with each other but after testings they discover that together could be an incredible duet and this went on to the Monsters corp.Many other interesting characters are introduced except Mike and Sullivan whose voices are played by the Academy winner Billy Crystal and the Well-known John Goodman and Helen Mirren as Dean hardscrabble as a strictly teacher of the university.I almost forgot the appearance Randall Boggs where we know why he hates so much Mike and Sullivan.After toy story 3 and Ralph wreck it Disney made another notable movie.i hope we can see soon another sequel of Monsters.",9,0,0,14 November 2013
Toy Story 3," What a great movie
","I remembered when i saw Toy Stoy 1 in 1995 and i was really excited by the film although that time the movie had good critics due to the special effects there were using.But i believe that a good movie is not only but special effects.If there is no story then there is no movie ''THE END''.And fortunately in both toy story 1,2,3 the script was gorgeous.There were many good moments in Toy Story 3 but the one i will not forget is the ending which was very sad and hopeful that an old season ends and a new starts.Who would believe that people will cry for toys?Many thanks to Disney and of course a great thanks to the creators of toy story.Its a movie that would be unforgettable.Once again thank you very much.",10,1,1,8 July 2010
La Vie En Rose," Oh my Goodness what a film
","La Mome is one of the greatest non-us films in the decade.It is about the life of one of the greatest French singers Edith Piaf portrayed by a very talented and very beautiful woman named Marion Cotillard.Of course other great French actors play such as Gerard Departieu,Emmanuelle Seigner,Sylvie Testud and many others.The film starts and ends with the same scene,showing Edith Piaf sining on stage.It starts from the age of 9 where she was raised in her Grandma's house and then later at a circus where by accidentally she finds out her secret gift her voice.Then we see her in the 30s and 40s how she developed as an artist,her great love that she never managed to see,her daughter who died very young and her deal she had with cancer which in the end it killed her.The last scene she is shown performing the beautiful song ''Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien'' in my opinion one of her greatest songs.Excellent film i do not wonder why it won so many awards with top the two winning academy awards for best acting role for Marion Cotillard and best make-up.This film truly shows what the European Cinema can achieve.",10,0,1,24 April 2013
Alien: Covenant," Not quite what i expected but better than Prometheus
","Alien Covenant is a very interesting sequel to Prometheus which left some important questions unanswered and unfortunately this movie does to. To begin with the basic story is about the spaceship covenant which has a destination to a habitat planet where there will transfered 2000 people but something happened in the procedure and the crew woke up.when they started to fix the damages of the ship they received a weak signal from the planet of the Engineers which it is not anyone else from Dr.Elizabeth Shaw and the android David who plays a vital role in the movie.The crew member visited the origin of the signal but soon they realize it is a very dangerous planet with dead engineers who were killed by David with the black goo that kills the host and create the neoform.David in this film has a twin android brother Walter who is more friendly to the people than David who killed Dr.Shaw and created the xenoform yes the known creature from the alien franchise. The ending of the film was clever but what i did not like is that there is no answer why the engineers wanted the humanity dead,why ridley Scott decided not to know more about the civilization of the engineers,why there is no answer how the derelict ship landed on lv-426 and how there was a second xenoform on the covenant ship since there was only one and that died on the planet and finally what happened to the neoform on the lv-223. In my opinion one film could lead to the events of the the alien movie of 1979 and do not try to create sequels with no meaning and more questions.",7,3,11,18 May 2017
