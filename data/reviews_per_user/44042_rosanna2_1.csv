Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Disappointed
","I love Tarantino, but this film was too long, too slow, repetitive and filled with long, drawn-out, sometimes embarrassing, dialogue. The pace and structure of the 1st made me think that the 2nd would be even better. Unfortunately, you can set the scene and develop the action until it reaches a frenzied climax, but I'm afraid it just doesn't work when you try to do it the other way round - which is what happened here.Volume 1 is, and probably will continue to be, my favourite film ever. Unfortunately, although still an extremely good film, Volume 2 doesn't hold a candle to the 1st.One film that he (Mr T) was 'pressurised' into chopping into 2..? Somehow, I don't think so..Volume 3 is probably being filmed as we speak..!",6,0,1,27 April 2004
