Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Very niiiiice
","I doubt i'm going to spoil anything, but just in case, there's the check. I really enjoyed the movie and saw it twice, will definitely get a copy. First, they did a great job on the makeup, and the gal who played Mrs. L was as gorgeous as they get. The vampires appeared powerful and the affects of speed, invisibility and other qualities were great although II really would prefer movie makers stuck with the idea that vampires remain in darkness.The battle scenes were very well done, much better than some I've seen in the past in other movies. There were some affects that were a bit far fetched, but as a rule, the movie was well made and entertaining. My family has historical ties to Abe so I remembered that as I watched, but it was a very good movie nonetheless, and personally I saw not much I'd do different. As one with black powder experience though, it cracked me up when Abe as a young man fired the pistol and I could clearly hear the powder slow burn in the tube as do blank rounds, but very few people would notice that. Overall, very good movie and I'm glad to see they did not insult Lincoln's memory by making him a shitty character like they did in Blood Bloody Andrew Jackson and the utter atrocity of Dog Meets God.",Null,2,4,4 July 2012
Dark Shadows," I liked it but did not love it.
","I grew up watching the original show and it was dark, spooky and mysterious, very Gothic and it sucked you in, so to speak. The movie did great with the logical idea of a victorian vampire waking up in the present, and the seventies was not bad, but the amount of killing done at a time was a bit underthought. The means of dealing with Amngelique was very lame, and the sex scene was something that never should have happened, along with the 'client confidentiality' scene that did not belong in this movie at all.I loved the house, but essentially the movie did disappoint in many ways. Barnabas appeared debonair, but foolish (organ scene) and if I had to guess, I'd say no one took the time to really study the original to get the atmosphere into it. Additionally Barnabas's issues over lacking a casket were very corny.They could have used the original atmosphere and left out the silliness and had a better movie, and Barnabas could have been much more dark. At least they did not deviate from the original plot as the Friday the 13th movies did, one movie barely related to another. If there is a sequel, I hope it gets better.",7,1,2,24 June 2012
