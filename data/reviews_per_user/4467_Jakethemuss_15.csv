Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It is nice...I like
","The lead star in this cross culture docu-comedy is Borat, an energetic yet clueless moustached Khazakstani reporter. Borat is Sacha Baron Cohen's more appealing alter-ego, and this film is much funnier and wittier than the crude, cringe worthy 'Ali G Indahouse'.The Ali G film was a failure as it took Ali G outside of his familiar mock interviews, which were humorous, and gave him a 90 minute film in which he had to operate on a higher level amongst a league of people very different to his bewildered guests. It relied too much on childish toilet humour and basically hammered a nail into Ali G's coffin.Anyway, enough about the past. I am glad to say that Borat is a lot more amusing and smart than the fore-mentioned. The film is done in a mockumentary style, in which the reporter travels to USA for 'cultural enrichment' as he believes it is the greatest country in the world. He is accompanied by Azabat, a short fat grouchy sidekick who only speaks in his native Khazak, and helps provide the audience with a grotesque naked fight scene with Borat in a hotel room. The strange relationship between these 2 never lets us down in terms of entertainment, as a kind of Laurel and Hardy connection seems to happen. I would say the humour arises in seeing the blatant culture difference between Borat and the mainly middle class, middle aged Americans he comes into contact with. However, it isn't only that social group he encounters, there are the young African-American 'gangstas', the drunken Leary guys in a campavan and the hand waving pentecostal Christians-all encounters are amusing in their own way.His startlingly backward attitude to taboo subjects like animal cruelty, incest, mistreatment of woman and even rape raise afew eyebrows along the way, as Borat goes about his business with his own un-westernised attitudes and beliefs never far from the surface.The humour can be offencive, such as the constant anti-semantic references (this is probably only allowed as Cohen is Jewish himself) in the form of Khazakstani village games and Borat's sudden fear and distrust upon discovering his kindly Guest House hosts are both Jewish. Then there are his comical reactions to being told women are equal to men and should be respected. This is NOT a film for the easily offended, but if you can appreciate the humour which arises due to the vast culture difference which is at the heart of this comedy, then you should be in for a treat.",8,3,6,26 September 2007
Hostel," Don't be expecting an all out gore fest!
","Despite this being a well directed and effective film. I feel this, like many other horror films, has been overrated in terms of gore. Slogans like 'The sickest film you'll ever see' grace the front cover..okay, maybe if you only watch like 5 films a year.I found the gore only came later on in the film, the first part of the film dealing more with the 3 carefree young travellers as they go exploring in Amsterdam. The unpleasant aspect of the film is not the actual on screen violence, more the way in which the 3 travellers are lead astray, promised beautiful women at this 'too good to be true' place of pleasure, all they have to do is catch a train and go there. Viewing becomes increasingly uncomfortable when you see just how wrong they were to go there, it seems they are 3 decent people alone in a sea of scheming strangers and evil twists. They are in unfamiliar territory, everyone appears to be hostile, you can feel the earlier energy in the film disappear as what was supposed to be a trip of a lifetime turns deadly serious.However, when the violence does come, it is pulled of with precision and skill, no tired clichés, no overblown heroics, just upfront depictions of one human being relentlessly sadistic to another. It is the idea which is revolting...business man paying big bucks just to be able to torture somebody for kicks. The actual scenes of physical torture are brief, but intensely graphic for their short period.If you want all out gore and violence, Hostel is not what your after, watch the remake of 'The Hills have Eyes' for that. Hostel, under the talented direction of Eli Roth, is an insight into the darker side of human will, and deals with how far some people will go to 'try something new'.",7,1,1,30 June 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," A Testament
","A testament in 2 ways. Firstly, you CAN have an action film with plenty of brains, secondly, you CAN have a 3rd in a trilogy equally as good as the first one, which is the case here. There is no cheesiness, no tired over used clichés, no silly macho heroics, just a damn good action thriller.This film works similarly to the others in terms of plot and content, but throws new ideas in, as this film trilogy never stops doing. Matt Damon returns as the much hunted Jason Bourne (does this guy get ANY peace?) as he once again finds himself on the run from ruthless CIA agents with ultra high tech gadgets, super advanced computer systems and on call assassins! Yet this is not enough to en capture Bourne, a man who could get from New Zealand to Great Britain using only a toothbrush and a coffee mug.This film uses shaky hand held camera techniques to help get the audience into the frantic and fast paced nature of the story, not to mention make the frequent action sequences gripping and exciting. The combat and car scenes are so realistic you almost forget your watching a movie. They have a raw, no nonsense feel to them. None of this slo-mo, souped up Matrix malarkey, it isn't needed. Here it is served upfront.This is the kind of film where you could go to the toilet and miss crucial parts of the story, seeing as everything happens so quick. It is not a film to wind down to or watch while doing something else, as it takes concentration to keep with it. But it is worth a watch, fans of the previous 2 Bourne's will not feel let down or cheated, as what was in the previous films has not gone walkies.",8,2,4,4 September 2007
28 Weeks Later," An injection of Hollywood isn't all that bad
","Upon hearing that a sequel to the brilliant 28 Days Later was being made, I was unsure. When I read the plot, I felt like totally dismissing the film. 'Oh great, Americans save the day again!' was my initially response, as I felt irritated at the idea of Amercians muscling in on an effective and quality British horror.I finally saw the product last night, and breathed a sigh of relief as my earlier doubts turned out to be a little off target. Okay, the sequel is much bigger budget with extensive special effects and a much wider focus. The low budget, grainy Indy feel of the first one is not so strong here, as the small scale setting of the first one has blown into a city wide, high octane military deal with skyscrapers, helicopters and all matter of weaponry. This film has many more people involved on a much bigger scale. You could call the whole thing an 'injection of Hollywood', but trust me, it could've gone a lot worse than people here are whining about. The energy of the 28 Days is still here, the shaky camera-work during combat scenes, the frenzied feel when the infected attack, the tension and the moments of emotion between survivors.In 28 Weeks Later, a section of London near the millennium dome has been wardened off by the military, in which society tries to rebuild itself after the infected have slowly died off. It is a complex of tall sophisticated blocks, high tech systems, and plenty of well armed troops around the campus. Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting) takes one of the lead roles as a family man who is reunited with his kids early on in the film. It is soon discovered that his wife is not quite like everyone else, a medical phenomenon, but at the same time very dangerous to be around. Without giving too much away, an internal outbreak is triggered, and lets just say the film gets VERY messy from here on in. If you thought the first one was gory, then strap yourselves in, as this goes off the scale with blood'n'guts. This could compete with 'Land of the Dead' for gore, albeit this is gore you can take seriously.Brilliant but never OTT special effects make the combat scenes gruesomely entertaining, camera-work is worthy, as is the tension as various survivors struggle to stay alive in what becomes a free for all area of carnage and mayhem. I thinks fans of the first one disappointed with this should be grateful it wasn't turned into something like Resident Evil:Apocalypse, which would've been just a little insulting.I think it would've angered people a lot less if the military force sent in to control and monitor the situation were simply UN, instead of having to be solely American. Apart from that the film kept up and gets 7 stars.",7,2,4,14 November 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," surprisingly graphic, surprisingly good!!
","Before watching this, I was expecting another tame, filtered down 'horror' yarn in the vein of recent day slasher flicks. I thought it wouldn't satisfy my thirst for on screen gore, or impress me as a remake of an old classic. I was wrong.For a mainstream, cinema released flick I was surprised with what they showed. I would liken it with Rob Zombie's 'The Devils Rejects' in terms of how the violence is presented. Although not as disturbing as that film, it is easily as gratuitous. I am no stranger to extreme cinema, but this still managed to make me squirm in some parts.The film tells the story of an ill fated American family crossing the barren deserts of New Mexico in an RV. Things take a turn for the worse however, when a tyre is punctured out in the middle of nowhere, leaving the family stranded in the supposed empty desert. At the time they are not aware of the danger that awaits them, whereas we are, which is when the tension starts to mount.It isn't long before the families unwanted guests pay a visit, and all hell ensues. Those who do go first, go out in hideous ways, leaving a handful of survivors to fight for survival against not only the wilderness, but the less than hospitable creatures that call the hills home. The film is directed in such a way, that you find yourself liking the family, and almost being there with them as they face the troubles together. Although it is a situation that none of us, or at least the vast majority of us, have ever been in, you could almost put yourself in their shoes, its a fear that feels REAL.What intrigued my the most, was seeing the movie's hero, X-men star Aaron Stanford, turning from normal day Dad to axe wielding avenger as soon as he realised he had to take action. Also good performances from Lost star Emilie De Ravin and Dan Byrd as her scared but helpful younger brother.I would recommend this to anyone who classes themselves as horror fans, as this does not fail to deliver the goods.",8,0,0,3 August 2007
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Never ceases to amaze me
","This is one of those fairly rare cases where the sequel surpasses the original. In fact, T2 surpasses a lot of films, old and new. It was made around 7 years after the first outing, and is clearly operating on a much larger budget than the original. It has a blockbuster feel to it, as to the late night, B-movie theme of the first one, which still became a cult film despite its low budget.The special effects are amazing, even by todays standards, but unlike other Hollywood blockbusters, it has story, emotion and depth to accompany the explosions, chases and CGI. It has been 16 odd years now since it was made, and despite afew choice haircuts and references to old school gaming systems, it feels as if it hasn't aged a day.Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, but unlike her character in the first one, she is now a lean, mean ass kicking warrior woman. Arnie returns as the T101 Terminator, only this time he is playing a bodyguard sent by the rebel side, to protect a young John Connor (Eddie Furlong) the future leader of the resistance. Those who have seen the film (almosy everyone) will know just how much protection John Connor needs, as the machines send back the dreaded T1000 (Robert Patrick), a being formed of liquid metal, that can manipulate his body into almost anything at the drop of a hat, queue amazing special effects.Sarah, John and the T101 unite soon enough and start a quest to try and prevent the rise of Cyberdine Systems, who are the company responsible for creating a special chip in the near future. This chip will give machines the ability to think for themselves, which in turn will have a devastating, and I mean DEVASTATING effect on the general population. They do this specifically by locating a computer developer named Miles Dyson, who is the lead scientist in the project. All the while, the T1000 is following their moves. He is more advanced than the T101, more ruthless and will not stop until his mission is complete.This film is literally great scene after great scene. There is the brilliant storm drain chases scene, Sarah's escape from the mental institution, T101 with the chain-gun, the battles between T1000 and his target's bodyguard, with the last half hour or so being pure excitement. The character development is brilliant as well, seeing Sarah's bond with her endangered son John, John's father-son bond with the increasingly human 'machine', and Robert Patrick playing the emotionless T1000 with cold eyed precision.This is a film which sweeps you up and pulls you into whats happening. It has laughs and humour to ease the tension, classic lines, great cinematography, top notch action sequences and scenes that will stay with you long after watching. If you haven't seen this, you truly should. It is unmissable.",10,4,5,28 August 2007
Jarhead," its not about fighting...its about NOT fighting
","First off. Don't go into this film expecting some hard boiled, guns blazing epic about heroics in the heat of combat. This isn't told from the point of view which fans of old WW2 maybe familiar with. So please don't say 'It didn't have any fighting in it' after the movie ends, as thats the point of the film.The story follows in the steps of raw marine recruits, or Jarheads, primarily Anthony Sworford (Jake Gyllenthal) who are just starting their tour of duty in Iraq. Being in their late teens early 20's they are pumped up, full of testosterone, and ready for some action. But as the film progresses, it dawns on them they misunderstood what 'war' actually is. Gone are the days of cavalry charges, battleground gunfights, valour. Man has been replaced by machine, war has become about technology, not about courage.Hoever, they are all in the same situation, young, inexperienced, far from home, and fighting against an enemy they can't see. Comradeship plays a key part in this move, as the marines realise all they have is each other, the marine next to them. They begin to form bonds that can never be broken, as they face the unpleasant pressures of war together.Sam Mendes does a terrific job in the directors chair, with Thomas Newman contributing to a brilliant score as always. The cinematography of the vast open landscapes, burning oil fields and sweltering hot deserts is spot on, and helps create the atmosphere for this film.",8,1,1,24 July 2007
Collateral," Stylish and serious
","This is a Michael Mann movie, and I must say it is in the same league as his others. It tells the story of Max (Jamie Foxx), a depressed cab driver with dreams of running a limo business. One night he picks up and unusual customer, Vincent (Tom Cruise). Vincent asks Max to stick with him through the night as he has multiple stops to make, he even offers him a substantial sum of money in return for Max's efforts.What Max doesn't know is that these aren't just ordinary stops. Max is soon wishing he hadn't picked Vincent up as things turn tricky.The film is shot in a similar style to 'Heat'; Lots of nice suits, clever use of lighting, no-nonsense action scenes and well developed character inter-action. Particularly between the cool calculating Vincent and the nervous Max. Camera-work is used to brilliant effect as well, it ranges from high up shots of the brightly lit city to close up facial shots, all accompanied to appropriate music.",8,0,0,2 December 2005
Batman Begins," What Batman is all about
","May I start by saying that the contrast between 'Batman&Robin' and 'Batman Begins' could not be more obvious. The 4th movie was disastrous and killed off the franchise for years, this movie comes storming in under a brilliant and visionary director(Christopher Nolan) and has replaced any garish comic book slapstick with a more serious and gritty tone. Gone are the bright colours and campness, this film means business! This time the black suit is filled by Christian Bale. He is an obvious choice for the caped crusader;hes good looking, well built and has a stern look that is used frequently to good effect. He adds a depth to the character that George Clooney didn't even touch, he shows us his dark side.....The element of fear is pivotal throughout this movie .This is the 5th instalment in the franchise and I would say the best. Yep, even better than the original Batman. Why? because it delves deep into Bruce Wayne's past: his parents death, his loving father, his pre Batman training at a snowy and mysterious mountain temple, his pre Batman attitude. The film itself is very slick: amazing special effects,pumped up action, stunning visuals and very interesting characters. Not to mention of host of new gadgets. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, young or old, as this movie truly en captures the spirit of Batman and tells you what he stands for.",9,1,1,30 November 2005
Ghost Rider," Rated 15....for age 15 and BELOW
","How could a film starring Nicholas Cage, Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda be bad? Lets ask Mark Steve Johnson, the director of this lacklustre cheeseball of a movie. Okay, hes a newcomer to the directing game, but that doesn't excuse how this movie turned out.I'm not familiar with the 'Ghost Rider' comic, but this film has done nothing to spur me into getting my hands on a copy. If you were to cross the average episode of Angel or Buffy, with Torque, then the result would be something like this. So if your no fan of those sources than I would not recommend watching this. The lines are so painfully tired and stale your left wondering whether its meant to be an all out spoof. It just seems to move from one embarrassing example of dialogue gone wrong to the next, interlaced with flashy, slow-mo action scenes, which maybe the only thing that stopped me from turning it off.As for the performances; it would be fair to say that this movie would come very near the bottom of the resume for most of the main cast. Cage at least puts a little effort in, but is really pushing it for a man of his age to star in a film like this, I mean 'The Rock' was over 10 years ago! His fancy wig and semi naked flexing in the mirror fail to impress. Peter Fonda puts on a grim face as the Devil, but...isn't the Devil supposed to be scary? As for Wes Bentley, the strange kid from 'American Beauty', couldn't they have found someone more sinister looking to play Blackheart? A little make-up and dark clothing doesn't really suffice.If your a special effects hound, then you may get a buzz out of this. If your a fan of cinema, then I recommend you prepare for a disappointment (if you feel the need to watch it). The director seems to think that by throwing fancy special effects, rip offs of better movies and cleavage into a stirring pot, the audience will fail to notice how lazy the film-making is.",3,1,3,1 February 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Number One Film
","Out of all the films I've seen during my life, which is easily hundreds, it would be most fair to say that LOTR: The Two Towers stands as my favoured film. The middle of the stunning Peter Jackson trilogy, it is not the biggest or boldest, or most important, but I feel it is scene for scene the greatest film I have ever seen.The film is basically split into 3 separate but intertwining plots. First, we see our warrior trio (Aragorn the Ranger, Leglolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf) as they track across vast plains in hot pursuit of the somewhat depleted Uruk Hai party that has kidnapped Hobbits Merry and Pippin, before making way to the ruling town of Rohan. Then, there is the ring carrier Frodo and his trusty sidekick and friend Samwise, who wearily hike across rocky unfamiliar terrain en route to Mordor, which is where Frodo's mission lies. Lastly and by no means least, we follow the path of Hobbits Merry and Pippin, who find themselves in the huge, dark Fangorn Forest upon escaping their green skinned captors. It is here where they see an old friend, and stumble across the ancient natives of the wood, who just might join their cause.My favourite sub story would have to be the Aragorn one, as not only does that have the most battle and combat, but is also the main attraction of the film for me. It is the 3 fearless warriors who must help defend the people of Rohan as they take the dangerous but necessary journey to the mountain fortress of Helms Deep. Which is where they stand firmly together and await the sinister Saruman's next move.I would not recommend this to anyone who has not already seen The Fellowship of the Ring, as this carries on directly and the viewer would be trying to fill in the holes as events progressed. It would also not be as enjoyable if you hadn't seen the build up to where they are now. It is immensely gripping and exciting to see the story unravel, almost impossible to not be totally swept in by it all. Everything has been handled just as it should, there is a little humour, passion, stirring scenes of valour, plenty of sword fighting and battle to keep the action fiends happy. As for the violence, it is not disturbing or malicious, but brave and uplifting. The men of the West, Dwarfs, Elves and Co. are fighting for a reason, to save themselves from extinction, they do what they have to do for survival. It is a true case of good vs evil here, light vs darkness.Anything else? Oh yes, glorious cinematography, excellent and effective use of CGI, amazing New Zealand scenery, captivating dialogue and character interaction, not to mention great performances from Viggo Mortensen as the softly spoken yet ultra strong, bearded uncrowned King of Middle Earth, Bernard Hill as the noble Theoden and as always Ian McKellen shines as the wise and knowing Gandalf. Very few performances were bad in fact. Then again, this film has VERY little wrong with it.10/10",10,1,2,4 September 2007
From Dusk Till Dawn," would you like a movie with your violence sir?
","Lets cut straight to the point. This is no masterclass in cinema, this is no thought provoking, intellectual study of human nature, or anything for that matter. Reality and subtlety go straight out the window for this flick. It starts as what looks like another 'bad robbers take hostages' movie, but soon enough descends into a 'feast your eyes on this' gloriously OTT, bloodthirsty, semi-comic piece of gore porn.It tells the tale of bank-robbing brothers Seth (Clooney)and Richard (Tarantino) Gecko, who are on the run from the law after several murders. Soon enough they run into a small family travelling in an RV, the father Jacob (Keitel) daughter Kate (Lewis) and son Scott (Lui). The Gecko's use them and their RV as means to cross the boarder into Mexico, where the brother have a meeting with a drug baron arranged. The meet is to take place at a brightly lit, Gothic looking venue called the 'Titty Twister' out in the desert. It is about now that the film starts to turn into another genre, the hostage plot steps back into the shadow as the bar's employee's turn out to be seriously, and I mean SERIOUSLY bad news.Does this mean it is bad? NO, I actually thought it was awesome upon first viewing and still do now. Its one of those totally uninhibited films you can sit back and enjoy without having to think too much. It is gripping from the start, seeing the Brothers run into various obstacles whilst evading capture, then later watching with baited breath as the remaining survivors trapped inside the Titty Twister contemplate their rather unfortunate situation.Clooney is especially good as wise cracking but highly dangerous Seth Gecko, its quite a change from his other roles. Also look out for horror maestro Tom Savini, 80's movie star Fred Williamson, Cheech Marin playing 3 separate roles and of course what film set in Mexico wouldn't be complete with out Danny Trejo.",8,0,1,13 August 2007
Green Street Hooligans," Alright ride...just leave realism at the door
","Reading through the comments, I'm noticing afew things worth mentioning. The majority of people slating this film are British and have a knowledge of football hooliganism, whilst the majority of those praising the film are American or European..therefor wouldn't't be expected to see the holes in the film the way someone from London may do.Heres the story in a nutshell: Promising journalism student Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood)is expelled from Harvard for possession of drugs, only he wasn't to blame, the drugs were hid in his locker by his roommate, who is a member of high society, therefor lets Matt take the fall instead of shaming his family. He travels to London, UK, to stay with his somewhat estranged sister Shannon Dunham(Claire Forlani) and his baby nephew Ben. However, Shannon is married to Steve Dunham (Marc Warren), who happens to be the older brother of Pete (Charlie Hunham), the fearless leader of the well renowned GSE, or Green Street Elite. Matt is quickly taken under Pete's wing and given and inside look as to how football firm's operate. Unfortunately, things take a turn for the worst when Matt's journalism past is outed, and he is mistaken for an undercover 'journo'-the worst enemy in this film. This sets a spiral of events in motion that threaten to ruin everything.Now for the lack of realism in this film that has so many people shaking their head.The Green Street 'Elite' seems to comprise of about 7 young lads in their 20's, none of whom come across as anything more than your average guy, in fact, there is doubt as to where they got their reputation from. Three of them hardly ever speak and add little to the story line, whilst one of them seems to just jump around swearing and cursing. Hardly an 'elite' if you ask me.As for the leader Pete, he is almost too overblown to be true, he is more like a Tyler Durden creation, just without the intellect or purpose. He is a stereotype of how the British 'lad' is viewed by some people. He swaggers around using Cockney rhyming slang, in a confused accent that ranges from Australian, to posh, to somethings else then back again. Many people have mentioned Dick Van Dyke in Marry Poppins...good association!! He plays the role TOO tough, and says his often corny lines with such an effort that its sometimes unintentionally hilarious. He thinks by clenching his teeth, swearing like a toilet and swinging his arms about he can give off an alpha male image that is supposed to draw people in. It does however draw little Matt Buckner in, as he holds Pete and the GSE with very high regards, following them round wherever they go. It is unrealistic how quickly he is taken in as 'one of the gang' and how easy he finds his transition from student geek to lager drinking, foul mouthed brawler. Also unconvincing, as no matter what front he puts on..he is still childlike, and those big blue eyes are about as threatening as a lonely puppy.Then for the actual fight scenes....well choreographed but VERY off target in terms of how these fight actually go down. 6 lads cannot walk into a tunnel and take on a crowd of brick/bottle throwing thugs only to escape with afew bloody noses. Elijah Wood would not be capable of dealing out that much damage in his first ever fight. Rugby tackling guys twice his size? knocking out thugs with one punch? please..this isn't The Matrix is it!I wouldn't say this film glamorises football related violence, but it does make it out to be something more than it is. It injects it with a code of honour that shouldn't be there, giving an impression that its justified for the GSE to beat the crap out of rival firm members as it boosts their reputation. If it glamorised it completely, it wouldn't'd deal with the subject of families, and the negative effect this kind of life can have on them.If your after a realistic insight into football hooliganism, walk right past this, as this is just make believe. If your after an overblown, pumped up, for the moment movie then you may have found something worth watching. The film is more a look at what happens when an impressionable young lad tastes a life he never had, and wants to bite off more, only to find the bite isn't so sweet the deeper you go. A sensitive subject given a little too much Hollywood treatment if you ask me. Football Factory isn't as enjoyable, but a lot more can be said for the authenticity of it.",6,0,0,30 June 2007
300," Rule No. 1: Never threaten a Spartan with death or slavery
","This is another of Frank Miller's graphic novel adaptations, with Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead remake)in the driving seat. Similar to 'Sin City' it is all shot in a studio under a dark filter and relies hugely on CGI and special effects, this is not necessarily a good or bad thing, but something worth noting.It is set in ancient Greece, Sparta to be exact, and tells the bold tale of King Leonidas and his 300 elite warriors who set out to defend Sparta from a vastly larger army of Persians. Only 300 march out as the authorities have ruled out the possibility of a full on war. 300 may not sound a lot, but these guys are not your average man. It quickly becomes clear that the Persian's have their hands full with this fiercely lethal, combat effective unit of sword wielding warriors.This film does not set out to be a perfectly weighed, factual, historical documentary on an ancient battle, but does set out to provide a powerful, energetic, gripping story of valour and sacrifice....and succeeds. The many battles scenes are gloriously bloody and graphic, with countless impalements, limbs flying, be-headings and more. The more you see the steadfast Spartan's achieve against vastly unfavourable odds the more you inspired you become, at least that was how it was for me.Great performances help make this film what it is. Gerald Butler is outstanding as the growling, fiery eyed, fearless Leonidas. His battle cries sound authentic enough to send a chill down the spine, and his unquestionable dedication to Sparta wins more than a little respect. Lena Headley gives a solid performance as Leonidas's wife and Queen, Gorgo. The love between the 2 is a true, pure love, and this is proved in her constant support to send re-enforcements to help her King defend whats their's.I remember the huge internet hype surrounding this film pre-release, and can say after 3 viewings, it is worth it. If you haven't already seen it, SEE IT!!",9,0,2,15 January 2008
Braveheart," Wallace's courage is inspiring
","This epic tale of patriotism, love and conflict opens with a birds eye view which takes you through mist and air out onto an open loch with scenic mountains in the background. This is accompanied by stirring bagpipe music, and shortly by the start of a narrative by Robert the Bruce.After a short introduction of a young William Wallace, involving his fathers death and his first step into warrior-hood, we are taken to present day England where Edward Longshank's tight rule over Scotland is getting increasingly harsh. Enter a fully grown Wallace (a rugged long-haired Gibson) who is back to start a family and a new life. He soon meets Muran, a girl who he remembered from way back. He and Muran fall in love and shortly get a private nighttime marriage, as a public one would result in the 'Prima Nocte' rule being enforced.Unfortunately, one of the English soldiers controlling their village confronts a scared Muran and forces her into a quiet spot. William leaps to Muran's rescue and all hell ensues. The commanding officer executes Muran promptly for assault on one of the King's men as she bit him whilst defending herself. She was supposed to meet William at a secret spot after she was rescued but was knocked off the horse.William returns to the village on horseback to give himself in, but he has other plans. The uprising that ensues is one of the most pulse racing and exciting fights that has ever graced the silver screen IMO. This is the spark that starts off the Scottish revolution for freedom. Soon, other clans join Wallace, then whole towns stand by him. He soon finds himself on the fields of Stirling for a real showdown. I thought I'd give you the first hour in a nutshell, the rest of the movie revolves around Wallace, Longshanks and the Queen of France as they all fight for their own cause.The battle scenes are ground breaking and upfront, the senses of comradeship, love, patriotism and courage all take a stand throughout the film. The music adds further to the epic, be it sad and haunting tunes, or strong and stirring bagpipe anthems. Wallace is portrayed as a beacon of strength and power, not to mention a much honoured leader. Sometimes Gibson takes his character a little too far, but the title Braveheart is one that is implied to Wallace's qualities. The films dramatic and moving ending is a good finish to a superb and powerful film.",9,76,143,27 November 2005
