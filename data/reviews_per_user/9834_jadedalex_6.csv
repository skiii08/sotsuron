The Blair Witch Project," I like it....
","I was impressed by the whole idea of this film. It's a fine gimmick, doing a horror movie via your average amateur camcorder.People get bugged with the sloppiness, jump cuts, and the total lack of a steadicam may lead many viewers to take dramamine before viewing.I rather enjoyed it. The camcorder 'gimmick' worked quite well along with the horror theme. I doubt that I would be up to any sequels, though!'The Blair Witch Project' remains an interesting piece of footage. See? I didn't call it a 'film'!A nice bit of cinema verit√©. And it scared me. Not as fun as Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead', but not bad either.",8,0,2,23 June 2010
Vertigo," Flawed and still one of Hitchcock's best
","'Vertigo' has to be one of Hitchcock's most personal films, along with 'Rear Window'. The story may be a bit convoluted for the average movie goer, but as a great lover of Hitchcock's films, I try to ignore some of the unbelievable plots and twists, and find 'Vertigo' a haunting, beautiful film.Along with another of Hitchcock's best, 'North by Northwest', 'Vertigo' has some incredulous plot elements, but Hitchcock may be best along with the mentality of the Marx Brothers' 'Duck Soup': to hell with a credible story line, but 'Vertigo', like 'North by Northwest', and like 'Duck Soup', is great entertainment. Only one man could produce films like 'Psycho', 'North by Northwest' and 'Vertigo'. And that is Sir Alfred Hitchcock.My main problem with 'Vertigo' is in the casting itself. Jimmy Stewart, one of the most beloved actors in the history of the screen, has almost no competition (with the exception of Henry Fonda) when it comes to playing the 'Everyman'. 'Rear Window' saw a rather quirky Stewart, but anyone would go a little nuts with a leg cast on in a New York summer. In 'Vertigo', he ably plays the former cop who must retire because of his terrible fear of heights.But then we are asked to believe that he becomes obsessed with a woman strangely haunted by the dead. The necrophiic undertones, the clothing fetishes - these may exist in the mind of Alfred Hitchcock, but I find it a bit of a stretch for Stewart to pull off.For me, Stewart's persona is just too 'normal' to be believed in his role as 'Scotty'.Other than that, I don't find much wrong with this film. It's a complicated tale that you need to watch more than once. That may be another of the film's flaws.Herrmann's music is beautiful, and so is Kim Novak (in easily her best film role) as 'Madeline'.One of the most effective scenes is when Scotty and Madeline go the the redwood forest. The counting of the rings of the tree make us feel Madeline's, and our own, mortality.'Vertigo' is a more complicated 'Rear Window'. But the themes of 'Rear Window' are more recognizable to the audience. It is a personal film and a crowd pleaser (as was 'North by Northwest') at the same time. 'Vertigo' is even more personal, like seeing one too many skeletons in the Hitchcock closet. And its dark theme is an acquired taste.",8,1,3,19 June 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Irresistible and manipulative
","What's not to love about 'Butch Cassidy'? Three bona fide stars with much appeal, a funny script, some lovely Burt Bacharach music.I found this a very entertaining film when it was first released; indeed, one of the best films of 1969.Subsequent viewings have been disappointing. How can I put it? Lots of nice frosting and not much cake.It's viewed best as a light comedy western, I think. Then again, I like 'Cat Ballou' for the same reason. And although 'Butch Cassidy' has some truly funny moments, I can't think of anything as funny as Lee Marvin's 'Kid Shaleen' from 'Cat', for which he deservedly won an Oscar.I also think of a true classic, 'Destry Rides Again', which kept a running dramatic story right along with some wonderful comedy.Don't get me wrong. Katherine Ross is very pretty. Newman and Redford are appealing, handsome male leads. It has a refreshing, quirky style. And it doesn't hurt to have one of Burt Bacharach's better movie soundtracks. (Although I find his 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' melody as over-rated as this film.)Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Redford is notorious for taking easy roles, always the 'hero' or 'anti-hero' (most likely the 'hero').Newman on the other hand is a fine actor, and has taken on some strong parts ('The Hustler', 'Cool Hand Luke'). I expect more of him.I've come to regard this film as a very entertaining and manipulative film. What's not to like about it? Redford at the height of his sex appeal, Newman's dreamy blue eyes, a very lovely Katharine Ross. It's a success. It's a very easy success.Personally, I'll take James Stewart and Dietrich's 'Frenchie' over this flick.",8,0,1,17 January 2010
Duck Soup," A triumph of Marxian anarchy
","'Duck Soup' was not received well in its original release. The Marx Brothers were on the outs after this flop, and it took MGM and Irving Thalberg to 'rescue' their careers.I can only assume that 'Duck Soup' was years ahead of its time. It is now rightfully recognized as the best of the Marx Brothers comedies.Basically, the magic ingredient is letting the Marx Brothers run wild. The story makes no sense, there is no clumsy 'love interest' subplot. 'Freedonia' is a country full of Marx Brothers' anarchy.Louis Calhern does a fine comic turn as Groucho's foil. Groucho also hurls some of his most classic insults to the always naive Margaret Dumont.They always say Jerry Seinfeld's show was comedy about nothing. The Marx Brothers accomplished this some sixty years before Seinfeld's TV comedy with 'Duck Soup'.Most of the very flawed Marx Brothers comedies contain very funny 'bits'. 'A Night at the Opera' is often held up as their 'best'. Nothing against Alan Jones and Kitty Carlyle, but as far as I'm concerned, their silly love story subplot only stalls more Marx Brothers' comedy. This subplot is presented over and over in so many of their films that it grows quite annoying.'Animal Crackers', 'Monkey Business' and 'Horse Feathers' are nice companion pieces to 'Duck Soup', and I consider these early films the Marx Brothers' best. These films let the Marx Brothers run amok, to hell with plot, rhyme or reason.One of the funniest scenes that Harpo has ever performed is his comic bit with slow-burn comic extraordinaire Edgar Kennedy. The shot of Harpo, now barefoot, kicking his feet in Edgar Kennedy's lemonade is classic. The celebrated 'stateroom' scene in 'A Night at the Opera' is funny, but Harpo is hilarious here.When I think of the funniest comedies ever made, 'Duck Soup' is in my top ten. W.C. Fields' 'It's a Gift', Mel Brooks' 'The Producers', John Landis' 'Animal House' are right up there, too. If you don't find 'Duck Soup' funny, you are clinically dead.",10,1,2,10 June 2010
JFK," Oliver 'Twists' JFK
","Oliver Stone is a very talented movie director and a tad paranoid. This movie is littered with misconceptions and for the lack of a better word, lies. Kevin Costner (one of the most boring actors in the world) does his usual cardboard impression (remember his take on the very flawed Eliot Ness in 'The Untouchables'?) of the 'valiant' Jim Garrison.In truth, Garrison was a couple beers short of a six-pack. It is fairly amusing that the Hollywood left decries the John Wayne cowboy and Indian movies, and then proceeds to rewrite history with its stirring 'docudramas'. Never mind the facts, just shoot the movie. Hollywood's love letter to Erin Brockovich overstated her role in the PG and E mess. In 'JFK', Oliver Stone points his finger at just about everybody in regards to assassination of Kennedy. I went out of the theater feeling culpable myself!Which is not to say that 'JFK' is not entertaining. The story is easily one of the greatest 'mysteries' of our time, and Stone's film engaged me despite all of its half-truths. The big problem is that a whole generation of moviegoers who saw this film no doubt accept Stone's version as some sort of historical document. This film should come with the horror show admonition: 'It's only a movie'.Costner seems to have taken over Robert Redford's mantle: always play the hero. His 'Eliot Ness' in 'The Untouchables' is so noble and good it's enough to make one wretch. Again, never mind the facts, that the real Eliot Ness had his share of problems and peccadilloes. The movie is only interesting because of the Sean Connery character (no doubt made up of whole cloth).Then again, I have had problem with 'docudramas' ever since the putrid 'The Greek Tycoon'. It's obvious what they are doing with these films, and it's obviously just 'entertainment' but unfortunately, these films leave lasting impressions in one's mind about real people and real history and the end result is the proliferation of lies.Hollywood seems to be getting desperate. The recent news is that Jane Fonda will portray Nancy Reagan in an upcoming film. What Hollywood doesn't seem to understand is that not too many people are watching anymore. Meryl Streep as Margaret Thatcher? Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin? I'm not even angry anymore with the Hollywood left. I just ignore them.'JFK' is a well-crafted movie, but I would not want to sit through it again. I'm one of those nuts that actually believes that the born loser Lee Harvey Oswald took aim at Kennedy from a bookstore depository window. And that he pretty much acted on his own.Call me naive. The Kennedy assassination was the mother of all conspiracy theories, and she has begotten many moronic children since then. I don't buy into many of them.",2,8,22,28 March 2012
The Artist," The Artist: Phony as a Glass Eye
","Easily one of the most manipulative movies I have ever seen. Not a 'bad' movie, this film reminds me of the line from 'Nothing Sacred'....'the truth, crushed to Earth, rises as phony as a glass eye'.There is very little 'truth' to be found in this sickeningly nostalgic film, which won best picture Oscar. This movie makes 'Cinema Paradiso' look like 'Citizen Kane'.Everyone is adorable. Even John Goodman. And if that wasn't enough, they throw in an adorable dog. I've never seen such manipulative cuteness since Paul Newman took Katherine Ross on a bicycle in 'Butch Cassidy', as the soundtrack played 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head'. Who could resist? Nobody.But I managed to resist this. A true lover of silent films and early Hollywood would see through the silly happy ending. It made me yearn for how beautifully done the original 'A Star is Born' was made. There could be no happy ending. We just see Norman Maine walking into the ocean. Which makes the real ending ring so true...Vicky Lester proclaiming herself 'Mrs. Norman Maine'.The movie's lead is reminiscent of John Gilbert, who would not make it successfully into the talkies. It's a shame. His love, Greta Garbo, even did exactly as the character 'Peppy Miller' did in 'The Artist'. She would not make 'Queen Christina' without Mr. Gilbert. And I believe Gilbert was fine with the role, but Hollywood, and his own alcoholism, prevented this from ever happening.Garbo, ironically, shared the same fate. In her second attempt at comedy, the public stayed away in droves to 'Two-Faced Woman'. No one wanted to see a happy Garbo doing the rhumba. What had clicked so well in 'Ninotchka' failed dismally in 'Two-Faced Woman'. That's the difference between an intelligent script and an uninspired one.When I viewed the happy ending to 'The Artist', it made me wonder. If John Gilbert could just dance a few steps, all would be sweetness and light! He would have gone on to a successful new career, provided audiences wanted to see Garbo rhumba, which they didn't.Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I have no doubt the makers of this film have a love for a glamorous old Hollywood. That this film rings of so much false nostalgia is unsettling. I hate to mention 'truth' again. But part of what makes 'Sunset Boulevard' such a fine film is its cynicism. Billy Wilder had a talent for making movies that turned out quite prophetic. We can all relate to Norma Desmond's declaration: 'I am big. It's the pictures that got small...'Imitation is one thing. Stealing music is robbery. We all know the great love the French have for Jerry Lewis. And incongruously, Sir Alfred Hitchcock. So I found it rather annoying that they copped Bernard Herrmann's music from 'Vertigo' for one of the scenes in 'The Artist'. Obviously, they must have gotten permission, but I doubt Hitchcock would be amused.There are clever moments throughout the film, but the movie winds up being an insincere, sloppy kiss to nostalgic Tinsel Town. You want to see a sincere and moving silent film? Try F.W. Murnau's 'Sunrise'. It was made in 1927.I probably wouldn't post such a negative review, but I'm amazed at what passes for 'great films' in the twenty first century. At the end of the day, 'The Artist' is only so much politically correct fluff. Where is Billy Wilder's cynicism when we need it?",3,2,4,14 October 2019
