The Avengers," Simply MARVEL-lous!!
","Definitely one of the best superhero movies ever... Everything about the movie was awesome. The storyline was great, fit well with the previous Marvel movies. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk- all their movies now seem to have a common purpose- to converge and culminate into an epic story! Guaranteed entertainment!The premise remains the same as that of any other superhero movie. The Earth is in peril, and its fate depends on a handful of superhumans. A super villain has a cunning masterplan- Recruit a deadly alien army, let them loose on earth, then rule it. Transformers did that too and it was all chaos. The story here was far better woven, with all loose threads from previous movies tied up neatly.When a Powerful thing goes into the wrong hands, and the fate of the world is at stake, Nick Fury(Jackson) assembles the most extraordinary team to retrieve it. Hulk (Ruffalo), Captain America (Evans),Black Widow(Johansson), Hawkeye(Renner), Iron Man (RDJ) and Thor (Hemsworth) embark on a mission to stop Loki (Hiddleston) from taking over the Earth.The performances of all the actors were great. But the real show-stealer was RDJ. The witty comments and the hilarious banter by Stark kept everyone gripped throughout the story. There are instances where you'll laugh out loud in really serious situations. The way the humor has been intricately embedded in such a grave storyline is lovely. Among the awesome story, fantastic direction and spectacular cinematics, the 142 min running time seems too short. Every main character has his/her moment of glory. All the hype which this movie has created is totally justified. Go in with high expectations- Thou shan't be disappointed!",9,1,4,5 May 2012
