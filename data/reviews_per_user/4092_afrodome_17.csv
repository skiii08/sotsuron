The Blair Witch Project," The Best Film Experiment of All Time.
","I can remember being 10 years old with my eyes glues to the TV on a Saturday night, brownie in hand, glass of milk on the table, and a drawing pad for when advertisements came on between breaks (commercials have always given me headaches).. I can remember the teaser trailer for BWP and remember thinking 'WHAT..WAS THAT'.. I was mortified. Later I learned that there were debates on whether it was actually real or not.. How f'ing scary is that? Even public news stations were conflicted in identifying it's authenticity. The buzz was because of the pre-meditated campaign that the creators easter egged around the internet, local TV stations, and faux-documentaries to really push the boundaries of a film that would freak out theatergoers around the world. The result? Panic attacks, people fleeing the theaters, afterglows of intense guilt for what they thought was a supernatural snuff film. People were in complete shock. This is also a result of the methodically torturous stress that was put on the cast. They were made to stay up without sleep, going into the woods at night blind and not exactly knowing just what to expect in the pitch dark woods. The fear and panic on the screen was certainly real, and that's why it's so effective: it's not the 'goul' making howling badger noises. It's the faint sound of a crying baby, going in circles, time warping dizziness coming to life on screen before our eyes, forcing the viewer to fall into the pit of madness with the characters on screen. I can only recommend this movie to fans of the genre that don't get thrilled by body parts flying in the Saw series but rather the crowd that gets goosebumps from the like of The Babadook, The Changeling and Pulse. The Blair Witch Project is a work of art.",10,2,4,3 May 2018
The Ring," 'seven days..'
","The Ring (2002) is a rare example of a remake that supercedes its predecessor. The combined elements of cinematography, character development, and special fx make for a movie that deserves acclaim amongst other classic genre flicks like Alien, The Exorcist and Let the Right One In. The scares are scarce, but that's what makes them so great. They never rely on a loud 'bang' sound to force its audience to react but rather used the ominous sounds of reverberated violin strings and the 'white noise' of a radio channel with no signal. Naomi Watts proves once again that she is one of the toughest actresses in Hollywood and still to this day is a true 'underdog' of the industry.While I didn't find it as scary as most fans did (I can understand why it scared them), the mood is genuine and consistent throughout the film; depressing and bleak, whilst not feeling too 'cold' or nihilistic, there's a heart at the center of all the grim Seattle fog. I saw Ringu as well, and found the 'medium/psychic elements made it feel more folklore/soap-opera and didn't fee grounded enough to engage me one hundred percent. The Ring pulls all the punches and delivers a better story arc, more fleshed out characters, and creepier imagery, and not to mention one of the most gorgeous production designs of any film in recent memory. The Ring is a classic horror movie that still feels fresh 16 years and 3 dozen ripoffs later.",8,1,1,12 April 2018
Hereditary," Nightmares Brought to the Big Screen.
","I came into the theater with high hopes that what I was about to witness would be a horror classic; a movie that is cutting edge, skin crawling, visceral, cerebral, electrifying, and to some degree traumatizing. I wanted a film that I could liken to classics such as The Exorcist, Alien, The Thing, The Descent, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Psycho. To my delight, I was not only impressed, I was in a state of disbelief. Once the credits started rolling and Both Sides Now by Judy Collins starts playing (kudos Ari Aster) I was 'shooketh'. 'What did I just watch?' I thought to myself. Now mind you, I wasn't particularly scared at all when the movie was over, but I think it went beyond being scared, thrilled. I was symptomatic of being sick: migraine, nausea, sweating, the chills.. it felt like I had the flu! However, it wasn't a flu, just the sheer intensity of this movie made me feel like I was running a temperature.  Onto the things I liked about this movie: DETAIL - I really, really enjoy Ari's approach to filmmaking. He's both humble in the way he presents himself and the work he does, and with his work, he puts his ALL into every element, shot, theme, color, camera movement, lighting; when watching Hereditary you can just see talent oozing from every shot of the film. One might require a second viewing, but when looking back on the film, you can see that this family is visually evident of being doomed from the get-go. You can see cult members lingering in the background as far back as the beginning (I didn't notice at first but when researching I got chills down my spine).Unexpected Horror - Midway, we see Peter getting an invite for a house party. The way this scene is built up is so incredibly tense, so gripping, that I nearly covered my eyes. Annie makes Peter bring his sister to this party as a means to give him an ultimatum on being responsible. Unfortunately, it backfires on everybody in the worst possible way. Charlie ends up eating chocolate cake that had walnuts while Peter is smoking pot with his buddies. We see poor Charlie in the corner breathing with the sound of constriction. Peter rushes her in the car and starts bolting down a dark desolate road at 80 miles an hour with Charlie gasping for air, kicking violently in the back (kudos Milly Shapiro for the electrifying performance). A dead dear is in then middle of the road, Peter swerves to dodge the carcass, and Charlie rolls down the window in an attempt to get more airflow, and then the unthinkable happens. Charlie hits her head on a telephone pole in a car going 80 miles an hour. Peter, in a state of shock, stops the car and can't even scream, turn around, nothing. His eyes watery, hands shaking, he pulls away, makes it home, and goes upstairs. The following morning, the camera remains on Peter's face with the faint sound of his mother going downstairs. What would follow was probably the most haunting, heartbreaking, ice cold experience I've ever witnessed in a movie. Annie's screams of absolute horror discovering her own child followed by a shot of the road where Charlie's head is, panning back to Annie's cries and pleas of wanting to die will be remembered as one of the most horrific scenes in cinema history.Realism -One of the most notable aspects of the movie is that there are no heroes. We have a mother, on the brink of a complete meltdown, harboring guilt and despair trying to navigate through life, barely hanging on. Peter is reduced to a scared child, screaming 'MOMMY' unable to keep it together anymore. Lastly, there's Steve. A father that cares for his family, but has no idea what the hell is happening around him. You can see his feelings of horrendous discomfort, but he has no outlet; he's the one that is supposed to keep everything as 'OK' as the universe will allow. This is the portrait of a regular family. When tragedy strikes, the grief is shared, and there are no heroes to turn to in a time of domestic crisis. The Music - Haunting, brooding, EVIL, thunderous, dread-soaked, and all done with a saxophone (odd but unique sound). Amazing job done by Colin Stetson.Supernatural Ending - I can understand why some do not like the ending. Some might say that the mental illness theme could have been utilized and the film would be more effective, and I would have to disagree. This film is a nightmare in that what people may think is mental sickness giving them a skewed view on the world, is actually a hellish force conducting their every move; premeditated and motivated by the forces of evil. The treehouse,..my God, the treehouse, was just dripping with pure evil. We have a statue with Charlie's decapitated head, corpses bent to appear like they are bowing before it, the chants of 'HAIL PAIMON!' the naked people in the woods, creepy and unsettling to the point where you almost have to laugh. In summary, I LOVED HEREDITARY and I believe it will go down in history as one of the greatest horror films ever made.",10,1,4,21 June 2018
Green Room," Brilliant Tense and Candidly Violent Thrillride.
","Green Room was without a doubt my favorite horror/thriller since The Babadook. While I enjoyed Get Out, I knew that I could only digest the film as a spectator rather than someone who has let their imagination take hold to what dangers lurk in a predominately white society; the lack of transparency and authenticity that one senses can lead to troublesome thoughts, and Get Out pretty much hit the nail on the head as a darkly comical satire with the format of a Hitchcockian thriller. Green Room not only brings it's action to live with a heightened sense of realism; developed characters with human-like nuances that make each person on screen feel real, no supervillains, everything being a situationally fight-or-flight scenario etc. it also takes the spirit of the punk scene and caters it throughout the film without missing a beat. While the film is brutally violent and shocking, it never delves into the world of nihilism that slasher films become codependent on (see Eden Lake).This movie is beautifully shot with no pretenses. There are no 'hidden messages' and doesn't treat you like some poor sob trying to dissect a poem. It's an in-your- face thriller that takes place in real time and you have barely any room to catch your breath if at all. Along with The Babadook, The Descent, 28 Days Later, REC and Let the Right One In, Green Room will be held high amongst the movies of the early 21st century that will impress viewers (genre-enthusiasts and regular filmgoers) for decades to come.",10,4,9,6 August 2017
Deadpool 2," If You Didn't Like Deadpool, You Could Still Like Deadpool 2
","I don't remember laughing so hard at a movie. I enjoyed the first Deadpool, sure, but I didn't love it. Deadpool 2 is everything I wanted in the first film and more. The narrative never completely ventures into serious territory, but the more compelling parts were pretty moving, despite the fact that there were gags around every corner. They never miss a beat; basically denying you of any room to breathe when you're laughing. The jokes are hysterical, the directions the movie go in are off the wall, the action sequences are incredible as well! It's not here to impress you, but somehow you're still impressed. Recommended.",10,4,8,22 November 2018
28 Weeks Later," Excessively Violent & Emotionless
","28 Weeks Later is certainly not a bad movie by any means. This is why people's subjective points of view are unneeded. If you want a horror movie with lots of blood and violence, quick editing, choppy cuts, followed by more violence, etc. this one supersedes 28 Days Later by a mile.For me (note: me; what I experienced, not the foreshadowing of your experience) there was a mean spirited vibe throughout the entire film. I felt like I was just watching bodies pile followed by close-ups of brutality with In A Heartbeat (the score from the previous film) being played GOD KNOWS how many times. My biggest gripe was with the thumb-in-eye thing: what the hell? Boyle did this in the first one to show human behavior in a state of rage and survival and how it mirrored the behaviors of the infected. They throw in Don newly infected doing it to his wife while she was strapped to a bed; seriously? From then on the movie leaves horror territory and starts becoming a sadist's playground.",5,1,2,19 September 2017
The Hills Have Eyes," Vapid, Sloppy, Dull Horror
","Man, oh man. I remember 12 years ago when I was a horror-hound junior in High School and the trailer/website for The Hills Have Eyes remake showed up on the internet. Despite my luke-warm response to High Tension (the clunky Lions Gate released a R-Rated english dubbed version left me disappointed) I was excited to say the least. Before I start critiquing, I want to note that I do enjoy a lot of horror remakes; The Thing is arguably one of the best horror films ever made. I found The Ring superior to Ringu, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) was a surprisingly brutal & unsettling experience, The Last House On the Left (2009) shot a dose of family drama into what many were expecting to be a trope-saturated horror flick, and I Spit On Your Grave was a balls-the-wall revenge shocker with no signs of pretentious social commentary. The fact that THHE is a remake is not the problem, it's just a really bad film. The film is so paper thin. The acting is solid, if not lazy at times. The violence is rather overt with no real purpose aside from appeasing to the fans of the vapid Saw franchise. The hillbilly killers look like guys from those high production haunted hayride events; they're costumes, blatantly absurd to look like actual monsters; it feels like you're playing something out of the Mortal Konbat universe. The most 'shocking' parts are nothing other than exploitation in high contrast. The camera work/editing is similar to a heavy metal music video, and the music at one point mimics the National Anthem after an American flag gets stabbed through a skull; I mean, were they serious? Then they try to justify this whole deliberate killfest at attempting to make somencommentary on the injustice of social classes? Kill me now! Horrendous movie.",2,1,4,9 July 2018
The Shining," Misanthropic but never scary.
","I've seen Stanley Kubrick's The Shining 3 times. I've had 2 repeating of this film not due to my enthusiasm, but because I was looking for that 'tick' that so many people get when they hoot & holler about this being the best horror movie ever made. And, despite me ranking it up a 6 from a 5, I was still not compelled. The Good:Very easy to talk about the many things that qualify this as a film made by the mastermind of Kubrick (despite it being his worst IMHO): the cinematography is one-of-a-kind. The hotel breathes in and out depending on what the characters are feeling at that moment, almost as if the hotel is breathing. Visual thrills are terrifically done in THe Shining. The elevator gushing blood is beyond cool, the one-takes with the tricycle swerving through the halls are very tense and makes you feel like Danny is going 80 miles an hour on the thing, the rotting water-lopped corpse of a woman slowly rising out of the bath tub, The camera panning to every axe-swing on the bedroom door, awesome stuff!The Acting: Rewatching The Shining, I had acknowledged that I was harsh on the acting of Shelley Duvall who played Wendy. Kubrick was good at giving each character an identity. Wendy in the film is an intelligent woman and can be a reliable team leader; but her big heart and compassion, despite being a quality, is what allowed her to ignore her intuition early on in her marriage.Jack Nicholson is the quintessential maniac. Just the slightest shift of the eye or brow and you're convinced you are watching a maniac. Apart from those wide shots of despair, it's Jack that makes the movie.The Bad: If I am watching a horror movie, I have to be immersed in it to get some sort of reaction. This is where The Shining fails me. From the beginning, you can see Jack is a closet narcissist who is trying to compartmentalize his real self into the darkest corners of his mind in order to be this projection of who he wants to be. He doesn't love his wife or Danny, he only loves himself. Kubrick is very good at giving nuances like such to his characters. Jack is a piece of # from the get-go. It's not the house that gets him, it's HIM who gets to him. His self- obsession, constant need for solitude, the need to feel in control by attacking others is a recipe for classic narcissist. The part that's hard for me to digest is that Wendy, considering how empathetic and compassionate she is, could not see Jack for who he was long before he went full 'cuckoo'. With that said, it makes the cat-and-mouse chase less engaging. Surprise! He's crazy! Yeah, no sh't! The other problems I had were the 2-dimensional dialogue in the beginning. Was I watching a 70's crime drama? Kubrick always has intense dialogue in his films, so it made me wonder why he opted for the 'backstory of the hotel' nonsense. Maybe it was a jab at the book and the horror industry? Seemed very out of place especially since the film picks up with a much more visceral tone in the second half.I couldn't honestly hold this next to masterpieces like Psycho, John Carpenter's The Thing, Carrie or horror granddaddy of all horror flicks The Exorcist.If I were to pick, I would watch A Clockwork Orange for the 12th time instead of The Shining for the 4th. I'll revisit the film in a few years and see if my thoughts change.",10,1,3,15 July 2017
Climax," An Electrifying, Horrific Experience.
","Gaspar Noe is not a director I particularly praise. Like Lars Von Trier, I'm in a polarizing category of cinephiles where some of Noe's comes off pretentious and over ambitious where his other films are hypnotic and captivating. Fortunately, Climax ranks as the most white-knuckle film experience I've had in a very long time.Climax has a formula that is very, very difficult to achieve: being groundbreaking in its stylization; a phantom-esque style of the camera just floating around. The shots are less like Into the Void and more like Birdman. Additionally, the film feels very organic. These are characters that don't need to be 'fleshed out' because they feel like real characters. I was a skeptic when I heard that trippy visuals were not going to be utilized, but I am so glad Noe took the approach of focusing on the characters and how their madness unfolds on screen. If you're having trouble finding a movie that scares you, Climax might be 'the one' that will finally make your palms sweat. The movie knows how to instill angst in the viewer. I can't remember the last time I let out a huge laugh after a film was over because I was so freaked out. Watch this movie but be warned it might make you feel strange for a few days after. This ties with Hereditary as my favorite film of 2018 and I recommend everyone watches it.",10,2,5,12 June 2019
Event Horizon," Event Horizon: A Cheesy Cookie-Cutter Gorefest
","I put very little faith into this film. I heard from a few friends that this was a terrifying movie . With that said, these same friends preferred the TCM remake over the original, gritty redneck docu-style craze-fest that was the original 1974 version, and would coincide visceral shock to 'quality scares'. While I respect everyone's views on film due to the subjectivity of the horror genre, I cannot understand why anyone would have any respect for this movie at all.Where do I start? Here we have a Director, Paul WS Anderson, which from his interviews seems like a really cool guy, takes influence from first-person video games like Doom and RPG's like Starcraft. THAT was his visual inspiration. Seriously? Formatting the style of a set from a video game? As a kid, I loved the Mortal Kombat movie, but I was 6 years old. I just wanted to see karate chopping and blades shooting out of Scorpio's hand. With Event Horizon, we get the same tongue-in-cheek style of Mortal Kombat, except the source material is a lot more unsettling: a mad-scientist constructed portal that has the power to bring you to other dimensions, one of which is the pits of hell. SUCH A COOL CONCEPT, RIGHT? Well, what we get is a oozing-with-cheese action blockbuster with paper-thin characters with dialogue that is more suitable for interludes on Playstation game. The gore is copy+pasted from the preceding and much, much better Hellraiser I and II, and the CGI is on par with the dreadful Spawn which came out that same year. I hate rating movies a 1 because I think it's distasteful and many people that rate 1's are conjectural as means to not get the movie they were hoping for. I hated There Will Be Blood in the theater, but loved it upon my second viewing. I thought The Ring was 'ok' when I first saw it, but really loved it upon my second viewing when I was alone on a rainy day. This film, however, I feel deserves a 1. I saw this m3 months ago and was p%ssed off at what I had to sit through. I thought maybe there was something that I had missed. Watched it again; hated it even more! *eek*.. The disingenuous actors/dialogues/stereotypes, the settings, lighting, absurd editing, vapidity of tone made me feel like I really wasted my time.I'm not an Anderson 'hater', because I appreciated the Resident Evil film. With that said, I'll just re-watch Aliens or Cube when I need my 'fix' for some scifi horror.",1,4,9,17 July 2017
Midsommar," Already Has a Cult Following.
","I wasn't as captivated watching Midsommar as I was with Hereditary, but with that said, this is a one of a kind film experience that had me in a state of laughing mania when the credits rolled. Bizarre doesn't even begin to explain where this film takes you. Some moments pulled me out of the film's ever growing psychotropic mania, but they were done well enough to actually keep me engaged. The character of Dani was incredibly acted and deserves some sort of praise during award season. Grief, anxiety and trauma are hard to depict on their own but in this case they are intertwined like what we see her go through is actually happening. Doesn't live up to the weirdness of Mulholland Drive but boy does it come close.",8,2,4,3 October 2019
Saw," A Celebration of Excess
","I saw this movie premier night at the local theater when I was 14. I was beyond thrilled to watch this movie. I was prepared for a visceral jaw-dropping experience, a middle finger waving anti-hero to Hollywood, a punishing Tour de Force that would kick my butt. Instead, what I got, was a 100 minute Nine Inch Nails music video with a 'THEN WHO WAS PHONE?' twist every 10-or-so minutes. Saw is an infernal editing fiasco imitating Chris Cunningham with jump cuts every 5 seconds, but with that it already has the gory visuals and gross subject matter, so it becomes way too excessive, like someone adding 3 packets of sugar to their Mountain Dew. To insult the senses even further, I'm being punished with a strobe-light flashback and audio clip of every single little twist that unfolds; and at that point I'm thinking that I really don't care what kind of twist gets thrown at me. The actor/co-writer Leigh Whannel does a solid job playing Adam. Carey Elwes, the man playing Dr. Gordon couldn't decide if he was ablacksmith from the Old West, a Brit or a property manager from upstate New York; his acting was awful. The setup in the beginning is promising, but it's just a constant strobe light of gore, screams of agony, and loud noises. The thing that had me excited for the film, was the scene with Amanda. They show a small part of Amanda's bear trap scene in the teaser, and I was sold. What I didn't realize was that abrasive ultraviolence industrial-music ridden strobe light style editing would take up almost the entire movie. And to think I was a gorehound 14 year old who loved horror, I would hate this movie. I still do, and am ashamed that this become such a hit that it would spawn another half a dozen movies and a video game; tragic!",2,4,7,17 July 2017
Zombieland," Trope-Filled Comedy/Horror
","There is something infectious (sorry, didn't mean to) in the idea of a zombie universe that compels writers to infuse comedy into it and then write it off as some sort of cutting-edge piece of entertainment. The world was already blessed with Shaun of the Dead: a hilarious take on the zombie genre that is superior in both humor and human drama. Zombieland borrows humor from Superbad, romance from Love, Actually and horror from...eh...it's zombies, you get the idea. Might resonate with 13 year olds, or somebody that gets a kick out of humor tee shirts from Spencer's Gifts. If you haven't seen Shaun of the Dead, then stick with that one. I really dislike this film, so I would not recommend it.",4,1,5,19 June 2018
Whiplash," A Spellbinding Film.
","I had no expectations when I rented this film. We rented the DVD and watched it on a small, 18 inch screen; but I had no idea it would be the most captivating movie experience I would have in years. The movie has been analyzed, deconstructed, theorized, among other things.. so there is not much else I can add other than it being a movie that rarely resonates to a level like when I first saw it. To me, it's a perfect film and a movie that I recommend to everybody.",10,0,1,21 July 2017
Final Destination," Why Would Anyone Watch This On Purpose?
",This is the very definition of tragedy porn. It takes the ideas of traffic accidents and plane disasters and turns it into a popcorn flick. Take something like Scream but instead of a masked killer (which has already been done to death) an airplane crash with severed heads and burnt up bodies. Why the ___ in this day and age would people pay money to watch dozens of violent deaths for the thrill of it? Watch a movie which shows tragic death without the depersonalization. It will serve as a reality check and maybe people will then understand that these filmmakers don't give a damn about film and that they only want to make money off of fetishized hyper-violence.,4,2,4,25 October 2019
Casino," My All Time Favorite Movie.
","I don't know what it is about this movie, but it's one of those rare films where you can watch it a dozen times, and it's just as thrilling as it was the first time around. Considering it preceded Martin's successful GoodFellas: a film regarded as a classic gangster film (and rightfully so), the format has a bit of the same style going, with a narrative to guide us through the story, and featuring powerhouse duo of Pesci & DiNero, but with this film, so as a result it gets overshadowed, but to me, it qualifies as a film on its own, MY favorite film mind you.There's a certain feel that this movie carries and it's nothing short of perfect. 3 hours in length and not a single minute wasted, it's a masterpiece. Compared to GoodFellas, it's just felt more solid, more nuanced, detailed, technical shots better executed, sound, light, every actor giving 100 % to make you feel immersed in the story. The violence is there too, and naturally it's a ruthless world, but instead the violence has more of a conscience. GoodFellas was hit after hit, sometimes leaving you feeling like you're watching a slasher, so it becomes ineffective. Throughout Casino, the violence is less common, but VERY real, sometimes comically shocking like Friedkin's Killer Joe, to bleak like what you see in American History X. Sharon Stone who plays Ginger plays the alpha HBIC perfectly, and as we learn later on, downplays what chaos she is capable of.DeNior, who plays Ace, is strictly business but he has a heart of gold. He's the narrator and the mediator, and more the more screen time he gets, the more you really like the guy. Comedia Kingpin Don Rickles is even in this movie! Just perfect! Capolavoro!",10,2,5,22 July 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Seriously?
",I'm surprised that this film was trying to be a fun & cheeky brit comedy considering the level of intentionally visceral bloodbath violence that's bombastically spread throughout the film's seemingly never ending runtime. How can anyone consider a film to be a comedy when there's terrorism-style bloodshed in every other scene? Do people find this entertaining? I find it confusing and intellectually dishonest. The headache I had after watching this horrorshow required more than a few Aleve.,5,2,5,20 August 2018
