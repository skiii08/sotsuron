Scarface," Epic!
","From the opening scene we get a morsel of the dynamic of Pacino's Tony Montana.  Being interrogated he straddles the pole of discontent for the process and irrevant thug.  From this very first scene you are enthralled with this character.  He doesn't budge from his instincts and does things his way.  The way of excess, greed, corruption and street bravado.  This character os one of the best in film history.  Terry malloy, Coreleone, Travis Bickle, Hannibal, Superman.  If superman were corrupted and from Puerto Rico he would be Tony Montana.  The chemistry between Pacino and Steven Bauer as Manny is that of brothers looking for greener grass.  The love they have deep down for each other makes the climax all the more hellish and speaks to the problems these characters go through.
Wanting success and getting it in ways that are ilegal and unmoralistic ultimately lead to death or something close.  That's the message a good one. But these two actors bring the thing to lurid life.At the pinnacle of all their exploits is a scene at a restaruant were Tony proclaims to the customers 'This is gonna be the last time you see a bad guy like this again,'  it brings chills.  This movie is a classic.We need another flick with Deniro and Pacino, doing more scenes together then just one.",10,0,1,4 June 2003
Bruce Almighty," Throwback movie with great special effects
","If you could take 'It's A Wonderful Life' and add 50 million in special effects you'd be in the ballpark.  Yes Jim Carrey is funny, yes Jim Carrey is self asorbed in the beginning of the flick and yes Jim Carrey somehow gets the powers of God and Jennifer Anniston to love him.  BEAU-tiful.  This is a really good film and Morgan Freeman is perfect for the role of the Almighty. Just watch it.  SPOILERS.There were a lot of great lines , like when Bruce asks God 'how do you get someone to love you without affecting free will?' to which God replied 'Now you know what it's like in my world, if you can answer that one let me know.'  Pretty powerful stuff.  Jim Carrey represents most people in that they are searching for things that truthfully they can give anyways, like devotion and heart to their fellow man.  But  in the beginning he is most of us in that we would love to impress our significant other in out of this world ways when in fact if they truly love you this doesn't really matter. A lot of good messages in a very entertaining format.  The script is really good in my opinion and any actor could have pulled this out as Bruce but Jim Carrey and his comic talent a plenty make this a tour de force that will be up there with the greats.......",10,1,3,31 May 2003
