The King's Speech," A rare movie that lives up to the hype. Best picture, actor and director and very deserving of all of them. I say A
","Even Kings need help sometimes. This is the true story about King George VI (Firth) and his problems with dealing with a stutter. After many failed attempts with therapists his wife enlists Lionel Logue (Rush) to help him overcome it. After Hitler begins to rise, England looks to King George for support. The stuttering king works to overcome it in order to lead his country. Knowing that this movie won Best Picture at this years Oscars there is a certain expectation going in. This movie does not disappoint and is a very deserving winner of the award. Colin Firth (who won the Oscar for this movie) does an amazing job, and much like Christian Bale in 'The Fighter', without Firth this would not be half as good. After all the talk and hype most movies disappoint when you finally watch them (especially when you are one of the last ones to see it). This is one of the few exceptions, it is as good or better then you have heard. For a movie about speech therapy it moves pretty quick and is very entertaining to watch. This is one not to be missed. Movie and acting are both great. I give it an A.Would I watch again? - Definitely, I would. This is one to buy.",9,0,0,20 April 2011
Insidious: Chapter 2," Better then most horror movies that come out but not the first one. Yet another sequel that falls short of its predecessor.
","'I went into that place to get our son back and something followed me and killed Elise, you saw it.' After Josh Lambert (Wilson) goes into the spirit world to save his son he is shocked when he finds that this event causes the death of the woman trying to help them. When his wife Renai (Byrne) questions what happened she notices a change in Josh. This change begins to effect the entire family and when a group arrives to help the family begins to experience the terror over again. I have stated that it takes a lot to scare me. I'm not saying that to brag I'm just saying that very few movies have scared me. The three that come to mind are Poltergeist, The Exorcism of Emily Rose and the first Insidious. That said I was hesitant to see this one because I was worried I would be scared again. On the plus side I wasn't scared at all, on the down side I wasn't entertained by this movie either. The first one was scary to me because of the possession of the little boy and creepy kids scare me a lot. Without trying to give too much away this movie was almost the same thing as the first one but this time Josh was possessed, and because it was an adult acting that way it didn't have the same effect on me. It felt just like another possession movie. I will say that this is still much better then most horror movies that come out but this is no where as good as the first one. Overall, yet another sequel that falls short of its predecessor. I give it a B-.",6,0,0,20 December 2013
Moneyball," An absolutely amazing movie that non baseball fans will love. Pitt and Hill have great chemistry. A must watch. I say A.
","'If we win with this team we will have changed the game for good.' After losing to the Yankees in the 2001 playoffs the Oakland A's begin to get picked apart. After three of their best players leave from free agency it is up to GM Billy Bean (Pitt) to field a competitive team. After meeting Peter Brand (Hill) he sees a new way to field a team. Using modern technology and math instead of scouting to rate players he signs of team of 'nobodys'. Being a huge baseball fan I was very much looking forward to this movie, this movie was even better then I was hoping for. Written by the writers of 'Social Network' it has roughly the same feel. Watching what a GM goes through on a day by day basis gave me new appreciation for what they do, and to watch Bean struggle with making a team with the lowest payroll in the league to try and compete with teams like the Yankees who have almost 100,000,000 dollars a year more is impressive. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie has nothing to do with the movie itself. Going in I knew enough history about what happened with this team and Beane himself that the tense moments and hard decisions lost some of the effect on me. But that in no way hurt my enjoyment of the movie, and for those that don't know as much about this it will have the effect it went for. On a side note Pitt and Hill have the same chemistry that Cloony and Pitt had in the 'Oceans 11' movies and that makes it more fun to watch. Overall, one of the best movies about sports (not just baseball) I have ever seen. There is also enough in this that even if you are not a baseball fan you will still really enjoy this. I give it an A.Would I watch again? - Absolutely, I want to buy this.*Also try - Field Of Dreams & The Social Network",Null,2,4,28 September 2011
The Avengers," Superhero movies keep getting better & better. They realized good acting & writing are needed. This is worth the hype. I say A-
","'There was an idea to bring together a group of remarkable people, so when we needed them, they could fight the battles that we never could.' After the God Loki finds his way to Earth, steals the powerful Tesseract and is close to fulfilling his goal of destroying the planet there is only one group that can stop him. After years of recruiting Nick Fury's (Jackson) team is ready. This is a movie that people will pretty much just watch without any prompting or reading reviews because of the hype and build up but I'll do one anyway. I have to start by saying that I never was a huge comic book movie person. When they first started being made it was pretty much just how much stuff can we explode and how cool can we make it look. Over the years they have been getting better and better and I think the success of the 'Batman' movies by Christopher Nolan has raised the bar. He has shown that a real story, plot and great acting can make a typical 'popcorn' movie into a legitimate movie. All the years of honing the genre have led to this. Not only is this a fun movie to watch but it is also a great acted movie and everyone is perfectly cast. Downey is the leader but is in no way overpowering and this has the feel of a real ensemble cast movie in the way that 'Crash' did. After years of movies like the 'Fantastic 4' and 'Spiderman' they finally realized the key to not just making a good comic book movie, but a great movie period. Good acting and writing are needed. Both are on display here. I have said for years that I am not a comic book movie fan...this movie may have changed my mind. Overall, not just a good and fun comic book movie but a good a fun movie...period. I give it an A-.",8,3,8,1 July 2012
Million Dollar Arm," a movie that is OK and worth seeing but came off as feeling way to forced to have the emotion needed
","'The potential of this thing is off the chart. It's the stuff dreams are made of.' JB Bernstein (Hamm) is a struggling sports agent who just lost his best client. Worried that he may have to close his agency he comes up with an idea that may fix everything. He decides to travel to India and find a cricket player that he can convert into a Major League Baseball pitcher. The problem is that he has a harder time finding one then he anticipated and he only has a year to make it happen. I am a huge fan of sports movies and I also love true stories but for some reason I wasn't looking all that forward to watching this. I can't say this is a bad movie because I did enjoy it OK but it was pretty much what I expected. The main downfall of this movie is that it felt too forced to seem real. That is funny to say because it's based on a true story but the entire time it felt like the movie was dragging you to where it wanted you to go. The thing that stood out the most was the love story aspect. To me it just didn't feel needed. The movie The Rookie was a much smoother style and really had the emotion needed for a movie like this. I know this review sounds harsh but keep in mind that I did think the movie was OK. The problem with a movie like this, one that has the ability to inspire, is it needs to be more than just OK. Overall, a movie that is OK and worth seeing but came off as feeling way to forced to have the emotion needed. I give this a B-.",6,0,0,6 October 2014
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Not only the best of this series, but the best movie of the new kids-saving-the-world genre. I highly recommend this.
","'I have a message for President Snow: You can torture or bombed us, blasted our district to the grounds. But do you see that ? Fire Is Catching... If we burn, you burn with us!' After ending the games, Katniss (Lawrence) is trying to build a normal life again back home. The government does not want her to become just another citizen and wants to use her to lead a rebellion against President Snow. She is hesitant until she finds out what happened to Peeta (Hutcherson). She becomes an inspiration for the world but struggles with who she has become. This is a movie that doesn't need much of a review. This series has become a phenomenon and everyone knows if they like it or not by now. At least that was what I thought. I did watch the other two but was never really impressed all that much by them. This whole new genre (Hunger Games, Divergent, Maze Runner, Giver, Ender's Game) to me is starting to get to be too much and they are really all the same thing. I had that mind set in mind when I went to see this. I'm not too proud to admit when I'm wrong and I have to say that I was blown away by how much I liked this one. The movie is tense and full of action. Having not read the books may have added to the tension I felt, but by the time the movie ended I wanted to see the second part right away. Even if you haven't liked the previous movies I would watch this one, it changed my mind about the series. Overall, not only the best of this series, but the best movie of the new kids-saving-the-world genre. I highly recommend this. I easily give this an A.",9,1,9,2 March 2015
Black Swan," A fantastic movie that is as much about ballet as 'The Wrestler' was about wrestling. Very dark, disturbing and great. I say A
","How far would you go to be perfect? After her lifelong dream of being the lead in a ballet, Nina (Portman) finally gets her chance. Pushing herself as hard as she can, she becomes so absorbed in the role it changes her life. This is a difficult movie to review without giving too much away. I can say that this is not your typical ballet movie. This is the same director of 'Requiem For A Dream' and that should tell you what type of film this is. I would call this a borderline horror movie, and there are equal parts sex and blood as there is dancing. Lily (Kunis) plays the Yin to Nina's Yang and the movie is better because of the two sides coming together. The director did the near impossible with this movie, a ballet movie that guys will really enjoy. I honestly can't say enough good things about this movie, or the the performances. Portman deservedly won the Oscar, and the fact that Kunis was snubbed in a big injustice. If you don't want to watch this because of the ballet, keep in mind that it is only a part of the movie. It is more of a trippy thriller than anything, a very good and well done movie. You will not be disappointed. I give it an A.Would I watch again? - Yes, I would. This is a movie that you will be able to catch different things each time you watch.",9,1,1,1 April 2011
Men in Black 3," My favorite of the series. Still a good family comedy but felt more adult and I enjoyed that more. Worth watching. I say B+
","'There's no other way for this to work. K has to be the one to go. K is the only one who can save the world.' Agent J (Smith) and K (Jones) are back and saving the world from aliens. When an old alien criminal that K arrested escapes from prison then goes back in time and kills K Agent J must return to 1969 and save K or else face the end of the world. I will start by saying that I did like the other two movies but was never a huge fan of the series. When I first heard about this third movie my first though was...why...doesn't seem like a new one is needed. After watching this I have to say that this may be my favorite in the series. While the others were OK this one seemed to have a real plot and felt more grown up then the others. There is still quite a bit of comedy and kids will still enjoy this but the overall feel was more adult based and I think that really helped me enjoy this one more. Overall, this is still a good family comedy but will appeal to adults more then the other two did at least I did. I give it a B+.",7,0,2,20 November 2012
The Monuments Men," Very much worth seeing but my expectations were just a little too high & because of that I didn't like it as much as expected
","'You can wipe out a generation of people. You can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still come back, but if you destroy their achievements and their history then it's like they never existed...that's what Hitler wants and it's the one thing we simply can't allow.' This is a true story of a group of 'soldiers' in WWII that were tasked with recovering priceless art that the Nazi's have stolen and return them to their owners. From the beginning the mission was set up to fail but they didn't take into account the passion of the men involved. I was really looking forward to this movie because of the cast alone, but again I love movies based on true stories. Due to that I had very high expectations going in. While I can't say I was disappointed it wasn't as good as I was hoping for. The movie starts off pretty slow but picks up and by the end you are glad you watched. The fact that this is a true story really makes the story that much more powerful and gets you invested that much more into the story and the characters. Overall, this is a movie that I'm glad I saw and it was good but I think my expectations were just a little too high and because of that I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. I give this a B.",Null,0,0,15 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Very tense & makes you think about both sides of the event and if the pirates were really evil or not. I say B+.
","'It was supposed to be easy. I take over ship, get paid, no one gets hurt.' In 2009 a Somali named Muse (Abdi) is in trouble and needs to get money for his boss fast or face the consequences. His plan is to hijack a cargo ship and hold it ransom until he gets his money. When he boards a ship captained by Rich Phillips (Hanks) he thinks he found his answer to his problems, but things only get worse for all involved. This is a true story. It's always more fun to watch a movie that is also a true story and even better when you see one that you remember the events when it was happening. As far as the movie goes it starts off pretty slow but grows more and more tense as it goes on. As great an actor as Tom Hanks is I found myself thinking that this is really a part that many people could pull off. Then I watched the last 20 minutes and realized why they got Hanks. Much like the movie Apollo 13, when you watch a movie that you know how it ends but still end up shedding a tear it is because of great filmmmaking. This falls into that category. A movie that builds momentum the entire time. Starts off slow but by the end you are hoping for more. I liked it. Overall, tense and makes you think about both sides of the event and if the pirates were really evil or not. I give it a B+.",8,85,142,14 October 2013
Sucker Punch," Way too much of everything, except story and plot. Note to writers...it's OK to say no to an idea once in a while. I say D+
","'For those who fight for it, life has a flavor the sheltered will never know.' After attacking her step-father Baby Doll (Browning) is locked in a mental asylum. Facing a lobotomy she escapes to a fantasy world and her and her other inmates plan their escape. This is an absolute mess of a movie. This is another movie that felt like there were 25 writers and no one wanted to say no to any idea that was given. Without giving anything away this movie contains : singing, samurais, orcs, dragons, robots, guns, explosions in a castle, helicopter flights, jet packs and runaway trains with bombs just to name a few. If this is your type of movie then you will be in heaven. To be fair I did watch the extended edition and found it to be boring, (the theatrical version may have taken some of the unnecessary footage out) and I kept falling asleep in parts so I'm not 100% on the plot lines, but I have a feeling that I didn't miss much. I know many will love this movie, I just couldn't get past how absurd it all seemed. Overall, this felt like a movie that didn't know what it wanted to be, so it tried to be everything at once. I don't think it worked. I say D+.Would I watch again? - No way.*Also try - Drive Angry & Sin City",3,4,10,26 June 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," An amazing movie that sucks you in and doesn't let go. Words can not do this justice. Watch this! I say A+
","'Welcome to the island of misfit toys.' Charlie (Lerman) is a very very shy boy just starting his freshman year in high school. From his first day he counts down the days till he graduates. He meets two seniors Sam (Watson) and Patrick who help him adjust. There are few movies that can suck you in in the first minute. This is one of them. This is a movie that has a character that everyone can relate to, which is very rare these days. There are also movies that are so good that words can not express how good they are. This is also one of those. I honestly can not express how great this movie is and can not recommend this highly enough. I was actually fighting back tears almost the entire time (I almost made it) and for me saying that about a non-sports movie that is saying a lot. I really have nothing else to say except this is an absolute must see movie. Overall, WOW...just WOW. I give this an A+.",10,4,10,17 December 2012
10 Cloverfield Lane," This is tremendously entertaining, keeps you guessing the entire time and is tense without trying to be
","'There's been an attack. I'm not sure if its chemical or nuclear but down here we're safe.' Michelle (Winstead) has just broken up with her boyfriend and is driving away trying to decide what to do with her life when she gets hit by a car. When she wakes up she is chained to a bed in a tiny room with no idea where she is. After Howard (Goodman) explains he is trying to save her from the devastation of the outside world she isn't sure what to believe. Now Michelle and fellow captive Emmett must decide if risking the possibly dangerous outside world is safer than staying with Howard. I was not looking forward to seeing this at all. I did not like the original movie at all and was expecting more of the same. I couldn't not have been more wrong. This movie takes place after the attacks of the first movie, but the style is totally different. First (and best) the movie is not a found-footage type thing. That is a huge plus. This is tremendously entertaining, keeps you guessing the entire time and is tense without trying to be. If you are avoiding watching this because of the original don't worry. This is much much better. When it ended I was actually hoping it would keep going. This is one of, if not the biggest surprise movies of the year for me. I highly recommend this. I give this an A-.",8,1,2,13 June 2016
The Finest Hours," A good movie that is worth watching but a very very watered down Perfect Storm type movie that I'm not sure I'd watch again.
","'We can't leave them out here alone, that boat won't last. We all live or we all die.' Bernie Webber (Pine) is a member of the Coast Guard that does everything by the book. After word of a drowning ship gets to the guard the only boat they have left is a tiny 12 person craft. Against all odds, and the advice of his superiors, Bernie and his 4 man crew set out in the middle of cold winter night to rescue a group of men clinging to hope. I was looking forward to this movie. I really liked the Perfect Storm and was hoping for something similar. Before watching I wondered why this one seemed to come and go so fast without any real hoop-la. After watching I understood why. This is a good movie and for the most part I did enjoy it but it was lacking something the Perfect Storm had; drama and emotion. The fact that this is a true story helps a little and does add something but to me this was just a little to generic and 'Disney-fied' to have any real punch. That hurt the movie for me. Overall, a good movie that is worth watching but a very very watered down Perfect Storm type movie that I'm not sure I'd watch again. I disappointingly give this a B-.",7,4,9,26 May 2016
The Equalizer," If you are into vigilante justice movies like Boondock Saints then you will like this. I did and I recommend this.
","'One day somebody does something unspeakable to someone else, to someone you hardly knew, and you do something about it cause you can.' Robert McCall (Washington) is a mild mannered employee at HomeMart. He spends his days helping his friends and spends his nights reading at a cafe where he talks to Teri (Moretz), a call girl. Robert like to live a quiet life but when he sees wrongs he fixes them the only way he knows how. When something happens to Teri he decides he can't sit back any longer and unleashes his own brand of justice. I had pretty high expectations for this movie because Denzel Washington doesn't make bad movies. I have to admit that I did really enjoy this and I highly recommend this but it was a little slow in some parts. The only real flaw with the movie is that is seemed to start in the middle and you are trying to play catch up for the first half. That said I did kind of like that rather than being spoon-fed the plot like most movies do. On the other hand this is yet another movie that Liam Neeson usually does, this one has a different actor. I thought Man On Fire was better but this was still very good. If you are into vigilante justice movies like Boondock Saints then you will like this. I did and I recommend this. Overall, a good movie that was just a few steps away from being great. I give this a high B+.",8,1,5,29 December 2014
The Expendables 2," Yes, this has a plot but who cares. Lots of stuff blows up, lots of big guns and Chuck Norris is in this. I say B+
","'I could've put you in the deepest, darkest hole, but I kept you out because I knew that one day would come when you were gonna pay me back -and today's that day.' The best of the best is back. The expendable crew led by Barney Ross (Stallone) is once again blowing stuff up, killing people and saving the innocent. When one of their jobs ends up with a crew member being killed the mission turns from a rescue to revenge. This is one crew you don't want on your bad side. I will admit that I did like the first movie and watched it twice but that was all I needed for that one. This one I had lower expectations for so that may have helped but I liked this one more then the first. There is a plot to this but in a movie like this one it doesn't really matter. It has all you want in this...tons of action, everything blowing up, big guns and Chuck Norris...what else can you ask for? Overall, I liked it better then the first one so if you liked that one you will love this one. Very entertaining. I give it a B+.",7,0,0,19 November 2012
War Dogs," This is my type of movie; true, interesting, funny, & makes you feel anger & fear toward certain characters. I highly recommend it
","'The entire defense industry was scrambling over this deal and the key to it was sitting in 23 shipping containers in the back of a rusted out warehouse on the other side of the world.' David Packouz (Teller) is a salesman that is struggling to make money, then he reconnects with his old friend Efraim (Hill). The two go into business selling small arms to the US Military, and the better they do the more respected they become. When they up the stakes and take on a $300 million contract to deliver ammunition everything changes. I was really looking forward to this movie. I love the actors, the story was interesting and it is true which makes things better. I was not disappointed at all. The movie was tense, action packed, full of drama and very funny. Almost had a Wolf of Wall Street type vibe mixed with a splash of Goodfellas. This is a movie that you can't talk about too much because there are so many turns in this it would be a shame to give something away. What I will say is that this is a definite must see movie and one that I could watch over and over. This is my type of movie; true, interesting, funny, and makes you feel anger and fear toward certain characters. I highly recommend this and easily give this an A+.",10,1,4,21 November 2016
Source Code," A very Quantum Leap like movie that is very fun to watch. A movie that makes you think about it when its over. I say B+
","'What would you do if you knew you only had one minute to live?' Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) is picked to be part of a new and secret plan. He is able to relive the last eight minutes of someones life over and over in order to stop terrorist activity. The only problem is that he doesn't realize it at first. His goal is to find out who bombed a train in Chicago in order to stop a bigger and more deadly explosion later in the day, but Colter wants to change the plans, if he can. This is a very good movie, but one you must pay attention to in order to follow it easily. This is from the same director of 'Moon', so if you have seen that movie you will know what to expect from this movie. This is a movie that would get better the more you watch, very layered type of movie and you will be able to catch different things each time you watch. One of the better sci-fi/thrillers along the lines of 'Inception' and 'Adjustment Bureau', not as good as those, but comparisons could be drawn. Overall, a very interesting movie that needs to be seen more then once in order to fully get what you need out of it. I liked it though. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - Yes I would, you almost should.*Also try - Speed Of Thought & Moon",Null,1,2,25 July 2011
Skyfall," For a life long Bond fan this is just about the best movie in the series. Has the feel of a classic Bond movie. LOVED it. I say A
","'He knows us. He's one of us. He comes from the same place as Bond, a place you say doesn't exist, the shadows.' The world's greatest secret agent is back, but is the need for an agent outdated in today's modern world? After MI-6 is attacked and M (Dench) is brought under scrutiny by the government Bond (Craig) alone is left to find out who is behind the attack while M is trying to both help Bond and defend the need for an agency that has been compromised. I know that a review is really not needed here, being the 23rd Bond movie either you will watch it or not. I am a huge fan of the series and was really looking forward to this after hearing this is the best Bond movie yet. I have really loved the Craig movies but for some reason they never had the feel of a Bond movie to me, I wasn't sure what was missing but they didn't have the same feel. Knowing that they were re-booting the series I was lenient and with this one the re-boot is complete. This had much more of a feel of a classic Bond movie and by the end I was excited to see the next one. I got chills watching a few times and especially at the end. This had possibly the best opening and ending to a Bond movie ever. I could go on and on about this but I will just say if you love Bond you will love this, if you have never seen one then this one will make you a fan. Overall, From Russia With Love is my favorite Bond movie but this a very close second, and I think may be more re-watchable. I wanted to watch this one again as soon as the movie was over. I give this a very high A.",9,193,302,5 February 2013
Iron Man 3," Much more realistic & darker then the others. To me that really helped the movie. Must see others before you see this. I say B+
","'Old days, never thought they'd come back to bit me. Why would they?' After the events of The Avengers, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) has changed. He has become more obsessed with his work and by throwing everything he has into it he thinks he won't have to deal with those events. After a terrorist attack effects one of his closest friends he goes one step further and tells the man behind the attacks to 'bring it on.' That off the cuff remark changes everything and effects everyone around him. I have never been a huge comic book movie fan. My main reason is because they are mainly nothing but how many explosions can we have. The Iron Man movies started a change where the acting and story become front and center. While the other Iron Man's were fun and comical this one was more dark and interesting. It is hard to make a movie like this realistic. The fact that they made this movie about terrorism really helped root the movie in reality even with all the comic book elements going on. There are a lot of little things in this I did have problems with but for the most part I was very entertained and that is what is important in a movie. Also just as a heads up you do need to watch both Iron Man and The Avengers movie in order to get everything that is going on. Overall, little things that bothered me didn't take away from the enjoyment. I give it a B+.",7,1,2,23 September 2013
Child 44," This is a movie that is very much worth seeing and I do recommend it, but it would be hard to watch more than once. I give it a B
","'There can be no murder in paradise.' After WWII Russia is doing everything it can to show that their country is perfect and nothing bad ever happens. When military policeman Leo Demidov (Hardy) begins to see a pattern between the 'accidental' deaths of children his reward is to be demoted and sent away. Now with his wife (Rapace) and General Nesterov (Oldman) he investigates on his own and what he finds is worse than he imagined. This is a hard movie to review. The acting is amazing. Tom Hardy is becoming one of the best actors working today and I think it is only a matter of time before he wins an Oscar. Watching him and Rapace play off each other is very intriguing and worth watching for that. On the other hand the subject matter is very intense and a little hard to watch if you have children. Nothing graphic is shown only discussed but that is enough. Overall, this is a movie that is very much worth seeing and I do recommend it, but it would be hard to watch more than once. I give this a B.",7,4,8,1 August 2015
Deepwater Horizon," The action is quick and relentless and a movie that should be taken as entertainment but not fact. A real must watch movie
","'We are a big company, millions of moving parts. We all work very hard to ensure those moving parts are functioning as a means to a very profitable win for all of us.' Mike Williams (Wahlberg) and Jimmy Harrell (Russell) have just landed on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig and have discovered tests weren't run like they were supposed to. Now, up against the executives from BP, and over a month behind schedule a choice must be made, agree with executives, or go with their gut. The decision resulted in the largest oil spill and one of the biggest disasters in US history. This is a movie that is just flat out exciting and entertaining and extremely fast paced. Politically, the movie is really one sided and portrays the oil executives as money hungry and willing to risk danger for a profit. I'm sure that was part of the case but maybe not to the extent portrayed in this film. That aspect aside, this is one of the best disaster movies made in a while and one that I highly recommend. The action is quick and relentless and a movie that should be taken as entertainment and not fact. Overall, a super exciting and entertaining movie that is a must watch. I give this an A-.",8,0,0,10 January 2017
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," So much fun to watch. 'Underworld' on speed with more gore. I loved it. Very fun movie. I say A.
","'History prefers legends to men. However history remembers me before I was a President, it shall only remember a fraction of the truth.' After stopping the whipping of a slave Abraham Lincoln's (Walker) father is fired from his job. Unable to pay off his debts his boss comes in the night and kills his wife. Young Lincoln sees this and begins his quest for vengeance. Ten years later he sees the man who murdered his mother and sees his chance, but it doesn't turn out like he planned. A man named Henry Sturgess (Cooper) begins to train Lincoln so he can complete his revenge. I have to say that I am a huge sucker for cheesy Sci-Fi movies. I love movies like 'Piranha' and 'Mega-shark vs. Giant Octopus'. Something about those movies are just fun to me. I bring that up because that's what I was expecting from this movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. While it was a little over the top in some parts, this movie was more of a straight horror movie instead of going for the cheesiness I was thinking. That made the movie even better then I expected. I have never really been a big vampire movie guy but this one was great and may be my favorite vampire movie of all time. This ain't your girlfriend's vampires. This is more like 'Underworld' on speed and more gore. Very very fun movie and you will never think of the Civil War the same way again. I highly recommend this, if you go in with an open mind and looking for blood you will love this like I did. Overall, a very fun movie that you can watch over and over. I really had fun with this one. I give it an A.",8,2,4,29 June 2012
If I Stay," A movie that wasn't cheesy but a little generic in some parts. The ending was perfect & really helped. Better than I expected
","'Sometimes you make choices and sometimes they make you.' Mia has a great and loving family. A boyfriend who is in love with her and she is one step away from her dream of going to Juilliard. All that changes after a car wreck leaves her alone and fighting for her life. Watching her family and friends at the hospital and looking back over her life she must decide to stay living and chase her dreams or let go and be with her family. First thing I have to say is that while this is a sad movie it wasn't as depressing as I was expecting. The movie did a really good job of making it emotional without feeling forced. The movie was able to stay away from becoming overly melodramatic or too cheesy. On the other hand though the movie was a little generic in some parts and you were able to see certain things coming. The whole movie you are trying to guess whether she will stay or go and I had a feeling that the choice would make or break the movie. I could see points for both sides and I have to say that I thought the ending was perfect. Overall, a movie that wasn't cheesy but it was a little generic in some parts. The ending was perfect and really helped the movie. This was better then I was expecting. I give it a B.",7,9,14,24 September 2014
Gravity," Words can't do this justice. Easily one of the best movies of the year, an absolute must see & the best 3D movie I've ever seen. I say A+
","'I hate space.' Ryan Stone (Bullock) is a medical engineer who is working in space on an experiment. She is up there with astronaut Matt Kowalski on his last mission and trying to break the space walk record. When ground control warns them of incoming debris Stone thinks she can finish before they are hit. She is wrong. When a rouge particle hits the arm she is on she becomes detached from the shuttle and her crew. Floating alone in space she does everything she can to make it back home safe. This is a hard movie to review. The main reason is because I don't want to give anything away. This is one of if not the most tense movie I think I have ever seen. Five minutes into the movie the action starts and doesn't stop until the end. I found myself white knuckled and holding my breath almost the entire time. There are very few movies that I have a hard time talking about. This is one of them. Words can't do this justice. This is easily one of the best movies of the year, an absolute must see and the best 3D movie I have ever seen. Overall, nothing else to say but WOW! Watch this!

The Maze Runner," To me this really felt like an updated Lord of the Flies. A movie that teens who like Hunger Games and Divergent will like.
","'No one survives a night in the maze.' Thomas (O' Brian) has just woken up in the middle of a field. He finds a group of kids his age and wonders about the large wall surrounding him. When he is told of the place he is at he begins to wonder why no one has thought of escape. After his first venture into the maze he begins to think there is a real chance of escape, but not everyone wants out. I was not all that excited about this. My son loved the books and was very excited about this, but as for me I just am not a fan of this new genre. The new 'teens save the world' genre like the Hunger Games and Divergent just haven't really appealed to me. That may have been the reason I wasn't all the impressed with this movie. On the other hand though when any series is planned in advance the first one is mostly introductions and set up so it is usually the weakest of the bunch. As for my son who said this was his favorite book series ever...he wasn't all that impressed either. Take from that what you will. To me this really felt like an updated Lord of the Flies. Overall, a movie that teens who like Hunger Games and Divergent will like. I give this a B.",6,1,2,15 December 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Any worries about Disney taking over the franchise have vanished after watching this. The prequel the world has been waiting for.
","'We have hope. Rebellions are built on hope.' Many years ago the father of Jyn Erso (Jones) was taken by the empire and was assumed dead. The Empire, has built a planet sized weapon called the Death Star capable of unseen destruction. After Jyn and the rest of the rebels learn that it was her father responsible for designing the weapon they learn of a built in weakness. Now Jyn, Cassian (Luna) and a small rebel group set out to steal the plans for the weapon and begin to finally fight back against the mighty Empire and its leader, Darth Vader. This is a movie that is basically review proof. It's Star Wars so either you will see it or you won't. That being said this is a must see movie. Since acquiring the rights Disney has made two movies in this universe. The Force Awakens was great, but essentially a large budget remake of the original made for the fans. This one, I like more. The first third or so was a little slow but then it picked up to the point of me not wanting it to end. This movie takes place between episode 3 and 4 but is basically episode 3.9. The movie is a live action version of the crawl before A New Hope. The movie ends right where that one begins. The CGI that was used was perfect and allowed you to really be transported back to the original movie. I was a little hesitant at first because this wasn't part of the 'Star Wars Episode Saga' but after watching this I have to say that this one fits right in perfectly and really adds so much to the original that it made be want to watch that one immediately after seeing this one. Overall, any worries about Disney taking over the franchise have all but vanished after watching this. This is the prequel the world has been waiting for. I give this an A+.",10,1,9,22 December 2016
This Is the End," A movie made solely for fun and fans. If you like Seth Rogan's brand of humor you will love this. I do and did. I say B+.
","'I don't want to die in James Franco's house.' Jay Baruchel is in town to visit his friend Seth Rogen. Everything is going fine until Seth tells him they are going to a party at James Franco's house with the rest of his friends. Feeling ignored and annoyed by the people there Jay wants to go home. Before that can happen the crew finds themselves dealing with the apocalypse. This will be another short review. This is not a movie you watch for the plot or the acting. This is a movie that you watch based on the cast alone. Everyone knows who they are and their brand of comedy by now and either loves or hates it. In this movie they all play themselves which makes it that much funnier. I do also think that at least half of the movie was improve because it is hard to write the dialog that is said in this. All that said if you are a fan of the Seth Rogan type comedy you will love this. If you don't like his style then you won't like this either. I do and did. Overall, a movie made solely for fun and the fans. I give it a B+.",7,1,4,28 September 2013
World War Z," One of the best serious zombie movies I have seen. Exciting, tense and fun to watch. I recommend this. I say B+.
","'If you can fight, fight. Be prepared for anything. Our war has just begun.' Gerry (Pitt) and his family start the day like every other day. They wake up, eat breakfast then head off to school and work. That's where the day begins to take a strange turn. When explosions happen and people start running no one is sure what is happening. After given safety Gerry is told he must go and find a way to stop what is fast becoming something that could end the world. I have never really been a fan of zombie movies. I really liked Shaun Of The Dead, but I'm not sure if that counts. I have to say that while the movie was a tad slow in a few parts this is a very good, exciting and fun movie to watch. The one complaint with this movie that I have is that it got a little repetitive, but that didn't really hurt the movie too much and the movie was exciting enough to keep you watching and tense almost the whole time. If you are a fan of zombie movies you will really enjoy this. If you aren't give this a try, I did and I enjoyed it. Overall, one of the best serious zombie movies I have seen.

The Hunger Games," Well worth watching but I think because I saw it late the hype was too much. I'm looking forward to rest of series. I say B+
","'And so it was decreed that each year, the various districts of Panem would offer up in tribute, one young man and woman to fight to the death in a pageant of honor, courage and sacrifice.' In the future the ruins of what was once North America the capital city of Panem stages a yearly contest known as the 'Hunger Games'. Two teenagers from each outlying district are forced to compete in a death match in order to keep the peace in the world. Katniss (Lawrence) volunteers in her sister's place and her mentor (Harrelson) soon thinks she could be the one to end the barbaric ritual. I have to admit that I did enjoy this movie but like most movies I saw it long after it came out and I don't think it lived up to the hype. I also have to say that a combination of that and having seen the movie 'Battle Royale' first may have affected my opinion of the movie. This is very good and I am interested to see the other movies they are making but this is defiantly geared toward the young adult 'Twilight' type crowd and after seeing 'Battle Royale' this was just to tame for me. Don't misunderstand me though. I did like this and this is a good movie but for me it was only a one time watch.

The Impossible," The true story of a family caught and separated in the 2004 tsunami of southeast Asia. Emotional but unbelievable. I say B
","'You've got to go and do something. Go help people, you're good at it.' This is a true story of a family that went on vacation to Thailand during the Christmas of 2004. The same time the massive tsunami struck. The family is separated and lost in a strange country wishing and hoping they will find each other again. First off I will say that this is very emotional so be prepared for that. Also I know Naomi Watts was nominated for an Oscar for this but the kid that played Lucas should have been the one who was nominated. As far as the movie goes it was good, and I know it is a true story but it was really just too unbelievable for me to really get into. When the super emotional parts happened I was thinking, yeah right rather then tearing up. That is just me and maybe I am heartless but I couldn't get past the totally 'impossible' aspects of the movie. All that said though this is a good movie and if you can handle it I would say watch it. Overall, a good true story that was just a little to unbelievable for me to get fully invested in. I give it a B.",7,0,0,1 March 2013
42," A movie not just about baseball but about the human condition. Best movie of 2013 and Harrison Ford deserves an Oscar. I say A+
","'You give me a uniform, you give me a number on my back, I'll give you the guts.' For over 50 years baseball (like the rest of the country) was a white man's game. After just missing the world series the previous year Brooklyn Dodger owner Branch Rickey (Ford) decides to shake up his team, as well as the world by signing the best Negro league baseball player to a MLB contract. For Jackie Robinson (Boseman) it just wasn't as easy as putting on a uniform and playing. As many of you know I am a huge baseball fan and I love true stories so I was very much looking forward to seeing this. Even with my high expectations the movie was still better then I was hoping. Besides the movie being one of the best I have seen in a long time Harrison Ford turns in what I think is the best performance of his career and I don't think an Oscar win for him finally is a stretch. The racism shown in this movie is bad but I'm sure it's not even a quarter of what it actually was. That fact alone makes your respect for Robinson leap up from its already high mark. Even if you aren't a huge baseball fan this is a movie you should see. It's more a movie about the human condition and the limits you can reach if you believe in something. Overall, best movie of 2013 so far and best movie I have seen in awhile. I easily give it an A+.",10,1,1,26 April 2013
Argo," Worth all the hype. Easily one of the best movies of the year. Still think Lincoln was better but this could win best picture. I say A
","'You need somebody who's a somebody to put their name on it. Somebody respectable. With credits. Who you can trust with classified information. Who will produce a fake movie. For free.' In Iran in 1979 the citizens were not happy. The Shah who massacred the people was sick and given refuge in the US. When the US refused to extradite him the citizens stormed the American Embassy and took 52 hostages. Six managed to escape before the embassy was overrun and find refuge with the Canadian Embassy. Worried their lives will be in danger when the hostage takers find out the launch a rescue effort. The best bad idea they had was to set up a fake movie and fly them out as part of the crew. The movie is fake but the drama and story is real. Sometimes seeing a movie after it's been hyped up you are disappointed. After all the talk of this plus it's Golden Globe wins really put this in an area where you have a certain expectation. This is one of the few that can hold up to those expectations. The movie was very very good combining humor and extremely tense situations made it extremely entertaining. I knew really nothing about this aspect of the actual story so the whole thing was new to me and that helped my enjoyment. I still think Lincoln was a better movie but if this does win best picture at the Oscars I would not be disappointed or surprised. This is a definite must see.

Star Trek Into Darkness," This movie is a rare example of a sequel being better then the first one. The best film of the franchise. I say A-
","'Space, the final frontier...' After saving Spock (Quinto) but disobeying orders Captain Kirk (Pine) is demoted. When a former member of Star Fleet, John Harrison, attacks headquarters and a close friend of Kirk's winds up dead he is chosen to lead a crew to find Harrison. When it turns out that he is hiding on a Klingon planet the crew must deal with the fact that they will be entering a hostile environment and their presence may be enough to start a war, but like all things, things aren't always what they seem to be. I have never really been a Star Trek fan. I did however really really like the first movie that this crew did a few years ago and was looking forward to this one. This movie is a rare example of a sequel being better then the first one. There isn't really much else to say about this since it does have a built in fan base but for a non-trekkie I really really enjoyed this and I recommend this.

Devastated Cal turns to a bar where he meets Jacob (Gosling) a young ladies man who tries to help Cal through the tough times. When Cal learns to be like Jacob he still feels like his life is missing something. Every once in a while a 'chick flick' comes along that I really enjoy as much as my girlfriend. This is one of them. The cast alone is enough reason to watch it, but this is a comedy with a lot of heart and I think would be good no matter who was in it. Carell and Moore do a great job and Gosling is very funny to watch. This is a movie that is pretty predictable from the beginning, but is still a very enjoyable movie to watch and keeps you interested the entire time. I highly recommend this one.

After he is told that if the war was to end his father will come home. Pepper tries anything he can think of, including a list given to him by a priest. This is one of the best family movies to come out in a long time. It is the type of movie that if it doesn't move you emotionally you are dead inside. The subject matter, and some scenes are a little harsh, but it reflects the times. That said this is not a movie you should worry about your kids watching and is one you definitely should all watch together. A moving story about the human spirit that is just flat out wonderful and touching. Overall, get your family together and watch this one, you won't be disappointed.

Ted," One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. So un-pc which makes it funnier. Believe the hype..A must see comedy. I give it an A.
","'Sometimes I think back to that Christmas morning when I was eight years oldI just wish I'd gotten a Teddy Ruxpin!' John Bennett (Wahlberg) is a lonely eight year old kid without many friends. For Christmas he gets a teddy bear and wishes he was real. When he wakes up the bear is talking and he finally has a best friend. 20 years later John has been dating Lori (Kunis) for almost four years and things are starting to get serious. The only thing keeping John from taking the next step is his friend Ted. I am a huge 'Family Guy' fan and next to 'The Dark Knight Rises' this is the summer movie I was looking forward to the most. I had very high expectations going in and was not disappointed in the least. I think it was actually funnier then I expected. Like most of MacFarlane's humor this movie is so over the top with off the wall references (a whole plot point is devoted to the Flash Gordon TV show from the 70's) and extremely un-pc jokes that you can't help but laugh at. I could go on and on about how funny this movie is but this is something you just have to see for yourself. I highly recommend this and this is the funniest comedy I have seen since 'Anchorman' one that I will buy and watch over and over and over. Overall, an absolute must see movie (unless you offend easy...then avoid this at all costs). I give it an A.",9,5,13,10 July 2012
Point Break," Watch it for the stunt sequences, especially neat in 3D, but if you're looking for a story you won't find one.
","'The only law that matters is gravity.' Johnny Utah (Bracey) is a former extreme sport athlete who has joined the FBI. After investigating a series of crimes he thinks that those involved live the same lifestyle he used to and it is up to him to stop them. The closer he gets to Bodhi (Ramirez), the leader the farther he falls back into his old ways and the line between agent and criminal begins to blur. This is a hard movie to review. Mainly because other than awesome stunt sequences the movie didn't know what it wanted to do. The original had an actual plot that involved bank robbers that were surfers. In that movie Utah infiltrated the group in order to stop them. This movie started off with the robbery idea, but quickly tossed it aside and forgot about it. This movie tried to become Fast and Furious, but again the plot got lost. It seemed to me the filmmakers wanted to make a movie about extreme sports and didn't worry too much about what happened in between the stunts. It did borrow form the original movie, but more in the way a book does. By that I mean you need to see the original to fill in the massive plot holes in this one for any of the story to make sense. Overall, watch it for the stunt sequences, especially neat in 3D, but if you're looking for a story you won't find one. I give this a C+.",5,4,6,28 March 2016

","A true story of a man (Franco) who gets his arm stuck after falling into a canyon and discovers the will to live. After falls into a canyon in the middle of nowhere, a boulder falls and smashes his arm between it and the canyon wall. Little food and water and no one knowing where he is he fights to escape. For the 2 or 3 of you who don't know how it ends I won't ruin it, but this movie really explores the human condition and shows what we can overcome if we really want to. This is a movie like 'Castaway' and 'Buried' as it involves basically one person the entire movie. The movie keeps you entertained the entire time, and it is a very tense situation. There are large chunks of the movie that have no dialog, but unless you realize there is no talking you don't really notice it. Franco does a great job with this part and is very enjoyable to watch. Very worthy of a best picture nomination. This is not a movie to just put in and watch, this is one you have to prepare for, the ending is very intense. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - I might, but this is another movie that would lose the impact in repeat viewings.",8,1,4,28 February 2011

","'1 step at a time, 1 punch at a time, 1 round at a time.' Adonis Johnson (Jordan) is trying to make a name for himself as a boxer. He is very successful but no one is willing to train him. His mother doesn't want him to box and he sees his chance passing him by. He decides to look into his past and finds the only person he thinks can help him. With the help of a boxing legend Adonis wants to prove he is more than his famous father. I am a huge fan of the Rocky series and was very excited about watching this one. I was trying to temper my excitement though because usually when they try and reboot something they fail miserably. This is a bright shining exception. Michael B. Jordan is a perfect choice for this and Stallone gives maybe the greatest performance of his career. This movie has the feel of the original and is almost as good. It sacrifices the theatrics for an actual story that makes you care more about the characters then the boxing. This is a movie that I just can not recommend enough. Whether you are a fan of boxing or not you will love this movie. For the first time in I don't know how long I walked out of a movie wanting to immediately watch it again. Overall, not just one of the best movies in the Rocky series but one of the best movies of the year. I loved it. I give this an A+.",10,1,4,14 December 2015
Just Go with It," A really, really funny movie. One of Sandler's best movie in recent years. Very much like Big Daddy, but funnier. I say B+
","'My tolerance level is here, if it goes up to here I'm selling you out and leaving.' Danny (Sandler) has a unique way to meet women, he uses a wedding ring. After a gorgeous woman named Palmer finds out his trick she threatens to leave unless Danny introduces her to his evil soon-to-be ex-wife. After getting Katherine (Aniston) to go along with it they all end up in Hawaii where things get complicated. After movies like 'Bedtime Stories' and 'Click' it seemed like Sandler was starting to move away from what makes him funny. 'Grown-ups' was good, but that seemed more like friends having fun then a movie. This movie is closer to the humor in 'Big Daddy' then any other movie he has done recently. While still a pretty soft PG13 Sandler, this movie is actually very, very funny. Nowhere near the days of 'Happy Gilmore' or 'Billy Madison', Sandler is slowly trying to capture his younger days, and with this and 'Grown-ups' he is getting close. The chemistry between Sandler and Aniston is perfect and I would not be surprised to see them in more movies together. Very, very entertaining and funny. A good laid back comedy that holds the funny all the way through, unlike movies like 'The Dilemma' which is funny, but turns serious at the end. Overall a very funny movie that will not disappoint.

","'I know there's things that you can't tell me, but I also think there's a story here. An important story.' In 2001 the Boston Globe newspaper was in transition. A new editor was brought in and budget cuts were coming. The team of the Spotlight section has just been given a new story to work on. The story deals with allegations of child abuse within the Catholic Church. What started off as a story with a few victims with one priest began to grow the more they dig. By the time they ran the story the victims and the number of priests grew to disgusting numbers, but it didn't stop there. This is a movie that makes you sick while you watch. This is another movie were everyone knows the outcome but that does nothing to make you furious with anger and want to scream at the TV. I don't want this to become too political or controversial so I won't go any further but I will say this is a movie you MUST WATCH. This movie is important and transcends the screen into true journalism and continues this needed conversation. I have seen 6 of the 8 Best Picture nominees for this year so far. This one jumped to the front of the line for me. Overall, a true must see movie and I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried at the end. This film will make you feel anger, disgust, gratitude and hope. Making you feel any one of them is the sign of a good movie, one that makes you feel all of them is the sign of a great movie that will be remembered. Watch this movie today.

Dr. Bennet Omalu (Smith) is a pathologist in Pittsburgh. When an NFL hall of famer shows up dead Omalu notices something strange about the way he died. After asking for samples of his brain Omalu discovers something he named CTE. When he goes to the NFL with this information they not only ignore him, but try and discredit him. When more and more bodies pile up he becomes hard to ignore. Anyone that watched football, and even most that don't have heard about this growing concern. Most also know that the NFL is trying to downplay the issue, but I didn't realize to what extent they were until this movie. All politics aside, I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was good, although I can see why Will Smith wasn't nominated, the real snub is Albert Brooks in this. He was great. Much like Moneyball or Draft Day this is a type of sports genre movie that isn't 100% about sports. Also much like the Big Short the movie will anger you the more you watch. It is possible to still love football and agree that it's dangerous and something needs to be done. That seems to be what the NFL is not understanding.

Don Jon," There are some very funny scenes in this one but it has a lot of heart and that is the reason to watch.
","'It's not that I can't stop I just figure why should I...it's not like I'm cheating on her.' Jon (Gordon-Levitt) has a fun group of friends and is passionate about a few things. One of which is porn. Because of this obsession he is unable to have a healthy relationship with anyone. When he meets Barbara (Johansson) he thinks he found the perfect girl. Little by little he begins to wonder if he will ever feel about a woman the way he feels about his porn. First off I will have to say that this is not for everyone. If you offend easy then avoid this. Also the first five minutes are the raunchiest in terms of dialog so if you can make it past that you should be OK. As far as the movie goes I did enjoy it but the thing about this movie is the abundance of sex and porn will distract from the true meaning of the movie. The movie isn't necessarily about addiction but more about watching a man trying to connect with a human in a way he never has before. There are some very funny scenes in this one but it does have a lot of heart and that is the reason to watch. Acting is great but all of this won't be given a fair chance because of the in your face porn aspect. That is a shame. Overall, a very well done and good movie that won't be given a chance by many people because of the subject. I give it a B+.",8,12,19,28 December 2013

After meeting Inez's new friends who he doesn't like he decides to take a walk. When the bell strikes midnight his life is changed. I need to begin by saying that I am not a Woody Allen fan. I have like 'Match Point' and 'Whatever Works' but that's about it. This is, in my opinion his best movie. While not as funny as 'Whatever Works' this one is very enjoyable and is not a typical Woody Allen movie. The time travel aspect in this is very interesting and is used very well and not in a cheesy fashion at all. If I was more into literature I think parts would have been more interesting, but I really enjoyed this movie.

During the Cold War '70's the head of MI6, Control, retires after believing that one of the four senior figures in the agency was a mole working for the Russians. Because of Control's leaving George Smiley (Oldman) is also forced out only to be asked a year later to investigate and find out who the mole is. This is a movie that I was very much looking forward to. I love all the actors and the idea of it is something I usually like. While this is not a bad movie by any stretch I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I knew going in what to expect and it's not the fact that it's a little slow moving but there was something else that it was missing that disappointed me. I don't know what though. I recommend this, but you must be in the mood for it. Overall, a good movie but for me it was disappointing. I give it a B-.",6,0,0,15 March 2012
The Hateful Eight," One of the better Tarantino films in my opinion, but essentially a remake of Reservoir Dogs, which isn't a bad thing.
","'Justice delivered without dispassion is always in danger of not being justice.' Marquis Warren (Jackson) is a bounty hunter without a horse trying to get to Red Rock. When a stagecoach carrying fellow bounty hunter John Ruth (Russell) and his prisoner passes by the two team up and head to a cabin in hopes of waiting out a blizzard. When they show up they are met by 5 others who have the same thing in mind. When Ruth suspects someone of trying to take his prisoner all Hell breaks loose and no one is safe. First of all I will say that I did enjoy this movie. I think Tarantino is a little overrated. I have liked his films, but I think sometimes he tries too hard and it shows. This one had a little of that in this but everything else made up for it. There are a few little issues I had with this though. First of all, I don't usually complain about the length of a movie unless its slow moving. While I won't say this was slow it could have been trimmed down quite a bit, some of the scenes went on a little long and some were repetitive. Overall, one of the better Tarantino films in my opinion, but essentially a remake of Reservoir Dogs, which isn't a bad thing. I give this a B.",7,1,3,28 March 2016
The Adventures of Tintin," A very good family movie that is fun for everyone. A cartoon like 'Indiana Jones'. I really liked it. I say B+
","'How's your thirst for adventure? Unquinchable Tin Tin.' After buying a model ship Tin Tin (Bell) is approached by a stranger who offers to buy it from him. When Tin Tin refuses he is kidnapped and brought aboard a ship. When a mutiny goes bad Tin Tin, his dog Snowy and the captain of the ship begin an adventure that could end up with a large, lost treasure. My main reason for watching this was because it was a Spielberg movie. After about ten minutes I was hooked. This is one of the few family movies that is actually a movie that adults can watch without feeling like its a chore. The best way to describe this is that it is a cartoon version of 'Indiana Jones'. The good ones, before Lucas added aliens. This is a movie that I was looking forward to and was actually better then I expected. I recommend this for family night. Overall, a really good movie that a family can all watch together. I give it a B+.",7,2,2,12 March 2012
Fast & Furious 6," Fans of the series will like this. I found it too ridiculous to get into. The chases were so unbelievable it was almost laughable.
","'You wanna catch wolves, you need wolves.' After their heist made the gang all rich they have all settled in nicely to normal life but not in the US. When Hobbs (Johnson) needs a way to catch a criminal mastermind there is only one call he makes. Dom (Diesel) and Brian (Walker) get the crew together again but this time they are working with the law. This is a movie that doesn't really need much said about it to convince you to watch or not watch. Since it is the 6th in the series you have either kept up or not. That said...I have seen all of them and only really liked the 5th one because it was more of a heist movie then 'I have car, I go fast.' I know what your thinking...if you don't like it don't watch, on the other hand I can't really talk about it if I don't watch them. This one was, how do I put this...not good. The plot seemed OK, help catch the bad guy and you can go home. The problem is that this seemed to be that last thing on the movies mind. Five minutes after they agree to catch him they find him, and let him go. Then Dom and Hobbs meet him face to face, and let him go. The only way to catch this guy is only during long car chase after long car chase. The stunts and chases got more and more absurd to the point of being laughable. ***SPOILER*** Taking down a TANK with a smashed up Mustang to taking down a PLANE with a car that looked like a GEO Tracker on a runway that must have been 60 miles long. I mean seriously! ***SPOILER OVER*** There are also so many people jumping onto moving cars I lost count. I will again say I am not a fan of this series...and this movie is an example of why. Overall, fans of the series will like it, I struggle to find anything good to say...even the dialog is bad. I give it a C.",4,2,4,9 December 2013
The Flowers of War," A very emotional and disturbing look at the rape of Nanking. 'Life Is Beautiful' mixed with 'Defiance'. Very good. I say A
","'The children can't end up in the arms of the Japanese, otherwise my men would have died for nothing.' When mortician John Miller (Bale) travels to Nanking, China in order to take care of a dead priest he is witness to the beginning of the Japanese siege. Upon arriving to the church he is upset that the children have no money to give him. He decides to stay at the church and look for what he can take. After a group of prostitutes show up he only wants one thing. After drinking all night he wakes up in a priest's clothes and witnesses an unspeakable horror that forever changes his way of thinking. This is an extremely emotional movie that deserves to be seen be a bigger audience then it will get. Christian Bale gives another Oscar worthy performance in a man who goes from selfish to selfless after witnessing how Japanese soldiers treat the young children that are staying at a church. Many parts of this movie are difficult to watch but this is also a movie that deserves to be seen. The movie will draw out many emotions in you ranging from anger to horror, but at it's core it is a very heartfelt journey of one man trying to save many. 'Life Is Beautiful' meets 'Defiance' with a little 'Schindlers List' thrown in. I recommend this, if you can handle it. Overall, a little slow moving but a movie that deserves to be seen. I give it an A.",8,1,2,2 June 2012
The Way Back," A slow moving but inspiring true story about a prisoner escape from the Siberian gulag during WWII. Great acting. I say B-
","How far can the human spirit take you? After being imprisoned my communists in the Siberian gulag during WWII, a group escapes and begins the long journey to freedom. This is another difficult movie to review for me. It's a true story and pretty powerful, but also very slow moving I thought. The acting is excellent, Colin Farrell is really, really good in this. The story is powerful and inspiring, but it is hard to get into. This is in no way a bad movie, but to me it was not as good as I was hoping. Many will really enjoy this, as I did, but I felt it was missing something to make it great. I just can't tell you what it was. Powerful and inspiring, just slow. I give it a B- Would I watch again? - I don't think so",6,1,3,20 April 2011
Begin Again," A less romantic Jerry Maguire with great music and a perfect ending. I really enjoyed and recommend this.
","'Forget the demo, let's make an album.' Dan (Ruffalo) is a music executive who has fallen on hard times. His marriage is falling apart, his relationship with his daughter is strained and he drinks too much. After his drinking goes too far he loses his job and ends up at a bar wondering what to do next. When Gretta (Knightly) steps up to the mic both of their lives change for the better. Much like the movie Words and Pictures judging by the cover I was expecting a cheesy romantic comedy that has been done over and over. Much like the movie Words and Pictures I was wrong. The best way to describe this is a music version of Jerry Maguire without the love story aspect. I really like how the movie shows what is happening from more than one persons point of view. This also shows what is wrong with most of the music executives today, focusing too much on a single song rather than the artist. My favorite line of the movie is when Gretta tells Dave that his recording of the song she wrote got lost in the production of it. The movie itself is OK, a little generic but the acting and the music really make it great and I recommend this if for no other reason than for the music and the amazing ending. Keira Knightly does all her own singing and she is actually really good. Overall, a less romantic Jerry Maguire with great music and a perfect ending. I really enjoyed and recommend this. I give it an A-.",9,0,1,26 October 2014
Megamind," Can an evil genius turn good? If you like Will Ferrell you will like this. I liked it but not for reasons I expected. I say B+
","An evil genius becomes bored after defeating his nemesis. After being sent away from their home planet's Megamind (Ferrell) and Metro Man (Brad Pitt) develop a rivalry. When one of Megamind's plans actually work he is left to rule the city as he wishes. Soon after he becomes bored and comes up with an idea to create his own enemy. When he meets reporter Roxanne (Fey) he begins to re-think his life. I liked this movie but not for the reasons I expected too. It was funny, lot of adult stuff that made me laugh. A very good soundtrack (AC/DC, Guns & Roses, Ozzy) that fit the movie. But the reason I liked it was because of the story and message. Very touching and family friendly. Not as funny as recent cartoons like 'Despicapable Me' or the 'Shrek' series but very enjoyable and good fun for whole family. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - If my kids want to watch it, I would watch with them.",8,1,2,19 February 2011
The Book Thief," Sad and slow. This was missing something to make it as powerful and emotional as it was going for. For me at least.
","'I'm always finding humans at their best and their worst. I see their ugliness and their beauty and I wonder how the same thing can be both.' At the beginning of World War 2 a young girl named Liesel (Nélisse) is sent to live with a foster family. The mother is upset that she only got one child while the father (Rush) falls instantly in love with Liesel. When he finds out she in unable to read he begins to teach her. This simple act of kindness changes the lives of everyone. This is a very hard movie to review. The subject matter is powerful and anything set in Germany during WWII comes with a certain aura itself. This movie however was just so slow moving and at times so boring I found it hard to stay focused on. The innocence of the little girl set against the backdrop of Nazi Germany is a great contrast and a good idea but the execution was lacking. I wasn't expecting an action movie or anything but it was just so slow that I really couldn't get into it. Also this is one of the most depressing things I have ever seen so the fact that it was very slow and depressing makes it hard for me to recommend. Overall, sad and slow. This was missing something to make it as powerful and emotional as it was going for. For me at least. I give it a C+",5,1,4,5 February 2014
Horrible Bosses," A funny dark comedy with a great cast, but I though it was going to be funnier. Aniston makes the movie. I say B
","'Our lives would be a hell of a lot better if our bosses weren't alive.' Nick (Bateman), Kurt (Sudeikis), and Dale (Day) all hate their bosses. All of them believe they have the worst boss ever and have sufficient evidence to back this up. When they reach their breaking point they start to plan on killing their bosses. When the wheels start rolling it isn't long until they fall off and things don't go as planned. This is a movie I had high hoped for. I think that Jason Bateman is one of the funniest people and the plot seemed like it would be awesome. While I did like this movie it was a little disappointing. The funniest parts in this one they began to do over and over and by the fifth time they did the joke it wasn't that funny anymore. I do think that the hype behind this one, as well as watching the 'Change Up' before this one had a lot to do with my opinion though. All the actors are perfectly cast and there are laughs, but it's not a constant laugh-out-loud movie like I expected. I will close by saying something I never thought I would...Jennifer Aniston is the best part of this movie. Overall, I recommend this but lower your expectations. I give it a B.Would I watch again? - I might but just for Aniston.*Also try - Hall Pass & School For Scoundrels",Null,3,6,1 October 2011
Black Mass," I would put this alongside Donnie Brasco and Casino. Not quite as good as The Departed but it's not too far behind. Watch this!
","'If nobody sees it, it didn't happen.' James 'Whitey' Bulger (Depp) controls Boston. He runs the most powerful mob in the city and his brother is a powerful state Senator. When he is approached by John Connolly (Edgerton) with an offer of an alliance with the FBI he thinks of it as a business deal. Now, free to do anything he wants, with the protection of the FBI, Bulger rises not only in the mafia power structure, but also to the 2nd most wanted man in the country, behind Osama Bin Laden. This is a movie I was really excited to watch. I am not a huge Johnny Depp fan but the mafia genre is my favorite. About 20 min in I have to say that I was very impressed with Depp and I think this is the best acting I have ever seen him do. For an actor like Depp to disappear totally into a character is difficult to do, but he pulled it off. The contacts helped, but his expressions and actions were unlike anything he has ever done, to the point of it being disturbing. I love all mafia shows but unlike the majority of them (Sopranos, Godfather, Goodfellas) this one makes you root against the main character. Overall, one of the best movies of this type to come out if a very long time. I wouldn't put this on the same level as Godfather or Goodfellas, but I would put it alongside Donnie Brasco and Casino. Not quite as good as The Departed (Nicholson's character was based on Bulger) but it's not too far behind. I really liked this. I give this an A-.",9,4,9,1 October 2015
Underworld Awakening," A rare sequel that is as good or better then original. Very fun and exciting to watch. I liked it. I say B
","'For 12 years, I was held captive by the humans. The world I once knew has changed. Vampires and Lycans are now the hunted.' The war between vampires and lycans has been interrupted by humans. The humans who found the existence of the two have waged a war to exterminate all of the 'changed'. When Selene (Beckinsale) is captured she is surprised when she wakes up 12 years after the wars. When she is free she begins her hunt for Michael...and revenge. I have to say that I have liked the first two (the prequel one was lame) but this one by far had the most action. A very fast moving movie that had a little different story then the others, which is why I think it moved so fast. It's been a while since I watched the others but I don't remember them being as exciting as this one. This is a rare sequel that is not only as good or better then the others, but also one that can stand on it's own. Overall, a really fun and exciting movie to watch. I give it a B.",7,3,9,2 February 2012
Suicide Squad," Sacrificed darkness for comedy, and it really softened the bad guys to the point where they all seemed like the good guys.
","'In a world of flying men and monsters this is the only way to protect the country.' After the death of Superman Metropolis is struggling with finding someone who will protect them from the new superhuman threats. When Amanda Walker (Davis) comes up with an idea to offer criminals the chance to join the fight no one is sure this is a good idea, including the unstable cast of villains recruited. When they see what they are up against even Harley Quinn (Robbie) and Deadshot (Smith) find it difficult to say no. I have said for a long time now that I am tiring of comic book movies. I really liked Batman v Superman though because of how dark it wasand with that in mind I thought this could only go darker. When I head about the reshoots to make it funnier I got a little worried, and after watching it I realized my worries were well founded. I'm not saying this was a bad movie, but it tried too hard to be a Marvel movie. By that I mean it sacrificed darkness for comedy, and it really softened the bad guys to the point where they all seemed like they could team up with the Justice League and not have any animosity. To me that hurt the whole idea of the movie. Robbie and Smith were great in this but Leto, to me, was a little disappointing, but that's not his fault. It would be impossible for anyone to follow Heath Ledger. Overall, not a bad movie at all, just a little disappointing. To me the comedy hurt the movie. I give this a B.",7,0,3,30 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The movie is OK & worth seeing but there's no tension or suspense knowing what the next movie will be like.
","'That's not freedom, that's fear.' Steve Rogers (Evans) is still trying to adjust to life in the modern world but he does have Natasha (Johansson) and Nick Fury to help him. Thinking there may be a problem inside the walls of S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury warns Rogers not to trust anyone. He takes this to heart and when Fury is killed Rogers becomes a fugitive from the organization. He must now fight the mysterious Winter Soldier in order to avenge Fury and also to clear his name. The first thing I will talk about are the good things about this movie. The Avengers movies seem to be leaning more to the adult side with a real story line and leaning less on the special effects that earlier comic book movies fell back on. This one is no exception. It is dark and has depth to it to make you interested in what is happening rather than what is blowing up. They all do a great job of tying into each other which makes it feel like one long story rather then separate stories they attempt to tie together. On the other hand the fact that they keep pumping these movies out is what made the main plot of this movie not work. The whole movie has to deal with the leaders of S.H.I.E.L.D. becoming corrupt and Captain America being an outcast. The fact that they have already started to film Avengers 2 and have announced Captain America 3 takes away all the tension and suspense of Rogers and Fury's story lines. From the beginning you know that Fury will be fine and Rogers will clear his name and fix what is wrong with S.H.I.E.L.D. If they wanted to really have the viewer wonder what will happen they shouldn't have announced future plans for the series. To me the Avengers movies have become more of franchise done solely to make money rather than movies done to tell a story. While they do make a killing when they come out they are starting to cheapen the industry and are watering down the product. There is failure to see that the longer the series goes on the more it will take away from what has been done so far. If you don't believe me now you will when Iron Man 6, Captain America 5, Thor 6 and Avengers 7 all come out. Overall, the movie is OK and worth seeing but there is no tension or suspense already knowing what the next movie will be like. I give it a B.",7,0,0,7 September 2014
Life of Pi," I was really surprised at how much I liked this movie. Thought provoking & very deep. One of the best films of the year. I say A-
","'He said you had a story that would make me believe in God.' Pi (Sharma) is a young man living in India trying to find himself. After discovering Krishna he finds Jesus and has to convince his family he is serious about it. When his family falls on hard times they decide to sell their zoo and move to Canada. When an epic storm hits the boat they are traveling on everyone but Pi is lost. Now on a life boat with only a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker to keep him company he must figure out where he is and how to get to land. I have said before that 90% of the way you feel about a movie is the expectations you had for it going in. I expected this to be boring and I was not excited about it at all. Almost from the beginning it had me interested and by the end had totally won me over. This is nothing like I expected at all. The movie is very religious and extremely deep and very thought provoking. By the end you are questioning everything you saw and leaves you wondering what to believe. That is the sign of a good movie, one that leaves you thinking about it long after its over. While I don't think this is the best picture of the year I did like it much much more then I expected and will say its one of the best of the year. Not bad for a movie that I expected to fall asleep watching. Overall, surprisingly good and very much worth seeing, you will be surprised like I was, the trailer does not do the film justice.

Doctor Strange," Felt like a movie & not another link in a money-grab chain. An Inception type comic book movie that had a fresh feel.
","'We never lose our demons, we only learn to live above them.' Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) is one of the best neurosurgeons in the world, until an accident leaves him crippled. When he hears of a miracle cure he seeks out the person that can help him. What he discovers is far beyond medicine and will change his life, and the fate of the world, forever. I have become really burnt out on comic book movies but I was interested in this one simply because it looked like an Inception type of movie. I was not disappointed. This was my favorite Marvel movies since the original Thor. This movie really felt like it could stand on its own without having to add 20 different characters with 20 different plot lines. The humor was great and really was used in good places, although a few times it seemed unnecessary. All that being said, for someone who wishes they would make original movies again I did like this one, simply due to the fact that this felt like a movie and not another link in a money-grab chain. Overall, an Inception type comic book movie that had the feel of something new and fresh. I just hope they don't end up doing this character to death like they have with Iron Man and Captain America.

Interstellar," This is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say it's just not enough. Christopher Nolan is a genius
","'We're still pioneers. We've barely begun. Our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us because our destiny lies above us.' Mankind has finally used up all of Earth's resources and it has become a dying planet. When Cooper (McConaughey) and his daughter stumble upon a secret outpost that contains the remnants of NASA they are told of the seriousness of the problem facing humanity. Cooper is a former astronaut and is given the responsibility of traveling into space to find a habitable planet for the human race. I have been writing these little reviews for almost 5 years now and for the most part I have found it easy to talk about every movie. This one I can't seem to find the right words for. The reason has less to do with my vocabulary and more to do with the awesomeness of the movie. There are some movies that words just cannot do justice to. The last one I felt that way about was The Passion Of The Christ. This is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say it's just not enough. I loved Gravity and this was 1,000 times better. Overall, really nothing I can say about this movie other than watch it. Christopher Nolan is a genius. I easily give this an A+",10,11,22,16 November 2014

In the not too distant future an alien race called Kaiju arrive and begin to take over the world. To fight back humans invent giant robots called Jaeger's. After a mishap the Jaeger program is discontinued. When it turns out that the only way to stop the Kaiju is to bring back the Jaeger's, a former pilot (Hunnam) once again has a chance to save the world. Before I start I will say that I was not looking forward to seeing this at all. I am a sci-fi fan but this looked slow and boring. That said I will say this was pretty much what I expected. The effects were cool looking but this is really an un-original mix of Armegeddon, Real Steel, Independence Day (complete with a speech) and Voltron. All of which on their own are better then this movie. Also as a side note my 14 year old son was not impressed either. Overall, many people may like this but I found it way to generic and boring to stay interested in the whole time. I give it a C.",5,1,3,13 October 2013
American Sniper," A very good movie that is worth the accolades it received. I did think Enemy at the Gates was a better sniper movie though.
","'You can only circle the flames so long.' Chris Kyle (Cooper) is an elite sniper. The deadliest sniper in American history. His feats have made him a legend. When he returns home from battle it is harder to adjust than he expected. This is a movie that is pretty much review proof. Millions have seen it, everyone else has heard about it. I was late in seeing this so I had all the hype behind it in my mind before I even started this. I will start by saying I am not a huge Bradly Cooper fan, but this is by far his best role. This is the first movie I have seen him in where I thought he was a very good actor. The one downside of this movie is that I wish there was more sniping scenes. There is a lot of war scenes but the actual sniping isn't really a focus. All that said this is a very good movie that I enjoyed, even with all the hype behind it. I didn't think it was as good as I have heard, but my son also said this is the best movie ever...that may have had something to do with it. I do recommend this though.

After falling asleep on a train he wakes up thousands of kilometers away with no idea where he is or how to speech the language. He is eventually adopted by Sue Brierley (Kidman) and her husband and starts his new life. Unable to forget his past, Saroo finally decides to seek out his home, mother and brother. This is a true story that is full of emotion and questions. Patel's acting in this is amazing. This is a movie that you really find yourself sucked in and rooting for Saroo to find his answers, while at the same time feeling a little bittersweet when thinking about his adopted mother. This is a movie where there isn't really a whole lot to talk about since the movie is basically just him looking for his family but that doesn't mean its boring at all. I did like this. Overall, a movie that is easy to see why it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, while at the same time easy to see why it didn't win.

Southpaw," Can hold its own and stand next to Rocky and Raging Bull as greatest boxing movies of all time. A real must see. I give it an A.
","'A fighter only knows one way to work.' Billy Hope (Gyllenhaal) is the biggest and best boxer in the world. He controls his world in the ring and his wife (McAdams) controls his world outside the ring. After his temper gets the better of him and his wife is killed Billy's life begins to spin out of control. Faced with losing it all he turns to trainer Tick Wills (Whitaker) in hopes of getting his life, and daughter, back. It is very difficult to make a boxing movie and succeed. No matter how good it may be it will inevitably be compared to Rocky and Raging Bull. I have seen a ton of boxing movies and they have all fallen short, not because they were necessarily bad, but because they weren't classics like those were. They both had excitement in the ring and a riveting story out of the ring. This movie had both of those qualities and belongs in the same breath and level as those two. Gyllenhaal gives an Oscar worthy performance and the story is what keeps you interested rather than when is the next fight going to happen. I could go on and on about this but I will just say watch this. This is one of the best movies of the year and one of, if not the best sports movie in recent memory. I can't recommend this enough. Overall, Southpaw can hold it's own against Rocky and Raging Bullthere is no better compliment for a boxing movie. I give this a A+.",9,2,4,1 August 2015

Wanting to be a better example for his daughter he gets a job and things are on the right track, until he gets fired. Needing a quick influx of cash he agrees to do one last break-in job, but what he finds isn't money and it changes his life. There isn't really a whole lot to say about these Marvel movies anymore. By this point either you love them and it doesn't matter what they make you will watch it, or like me you think they have run its course. On the other hand though, I am 37 and not the audience they are going for. My 16 year old son loved it. I did think this was the most entertaining one in a while and it was very funny and inventive. A superhero version of Honey I Shrunk The Kids. Paul Rudd was the perfect choice for this role. These movies have become review proof, either you are all in on this series or your not.

","'You are here because you some Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus lookin' mothers. You will be going in as undercover high school students.' After two new to the force cops Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) mess up an important arrest they are reassigned to an undercover mission dealing with high school drugs. After being sent back to school their job is to fit in with the kids and try to uncover the source of the drugs, without being made. I have to admit that I was looking forward to this because I think Jonah Hill is hilarious in everything. I never saw the TV show and really didn't know what this was going to be like. After the first ten minutes I began laughing so much that my side hurt and by the end of it I was in pain from the laughter, it never stopped. There are some great lines in this but the timing of Hill and Tatum (who really surprised me in this) is great and I really hope they make another one. This is a must see for comedy fans.

","'Our goal is to create the greatest army in history. But every army begins with one man. He will be the first in a new breed of super-soldier.' After tiny Steve Rogers is once again denied entrance to the US Army he is followed by Dr. Abraham Erskine. When told about an option to join he jumps on it. After a series of tests he is given an experimental procedure to make him s 'super-soldier'. He comes out bigger, stronger and faster. He becomes Captain America. This movie is another victim of hype. This is a very good movie, but it's not the 'best superhero' movie ever. I do think that the releasing has a lot to do with that. In my opinion the best superhero movie of the year was 'X-Men : First Class', and if this came out first I may have liked this more. The one thing I really liked about this movie is that it was more like 'X-Men' then 'Green Lantern' in the fact that it was more about the story then effects. That did help the movie, as well as the casting. Overall, this is a good movie but with the hype, as well as the other comic book movies released lately, I was expecting more. I give it a B.*Also try - Iron Man & X-Men : First Class",Null,0,2,23 October 2011
American Hustle," I couldn't find anyone to root for or even care for. A big disappointment especially with this cast. Not best picture worthy
","'The art of survival is a story that never ends.' Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) is a con-man who works low level scams but makes a killing. One night at a party he meets a woman named Sydney Prosser (Adams) and his life is changed. He not only finds a new lover but also a new partner. When she sets up a deal that goes bad they are forced to work for the FBI or spend their lives in jail. The opening of the movie states that 'some of this actually happened' so this isn't really a true story just as a heads up. I wanted to see this movie for one reason...the cast. The cast in this is amazing and how can a movie with this cast be bad? The answer to that slowly revealed itself as I watched. It boiled down to the fact that none of the characters were really like-able at all and because of that I felt no connection to any of them. The cardinal sin for any movie is for the watcher not to be involved in the characters lives, if you don't care about them then it doesn't matter what happens in the movie. That is how I felt watching this. Bale did a great job in this but I found it really hard to get into the movie and couldn't find anyone to root for or even care for. That fact alone brought down the enjoyment of the movie and when it ended I was very disappointed by what I saw. Overall, a big disappointment, especially with this cast. Not worthy of the best picture nomination at all. I disappointingly give this a B-.",5,6,10,5 February 2014
Rush," The movie was better then I expected but was missing something to cause the necessary emotions. Never felt connections with the people
","'Don't go to men who are willing to kill themselves driving around in circles looking for normality.' During the 1970's Formula 1 racing was hugely popular. Two of the most popular drivers at that time were James Hunt (Hemsworth)and Niki Lauda (Brühl). They were instant rivals and personal enemies. During the 1976 season the rivalry hit its peak and the two found themselves neck and neck for the world championship. When Niki is involved in an horrific accident the two realize what they mean to each other. I was a little hesitant about watching this going in for a few reasons. I am not a racing fan nor am I a fan of racing movies. I wasn't a big fan of Days Of Thunder...so that is my disclaimer. As far as this movie goes it was better then I was expecting but I never really felt a connection with any of the people and when the accident happened it didn't really have any affect on me. Days Of Thunder did have more of a rivalry feel to it and played that up. This one focused more on each driver individually more then the racing rivalry. When you watch it you will know what I mean. Overall, the movie was better then I expected but was really missing something to cause the necessary emotions. I give this a B-.",6,2,7,24 January 2014
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," I'm not a fan of Samberg but I have to admit I really enjoyed this and this was much better than I expected.
","'Ever since I was born, I was dope.' Conner (Samberg) was part of the biggest boy band in history. After the break up he decides to begin his solo career. After some success he is excited to release his new album. When it is released tomixed reviews.he tries everything he can to remain on top, but things don't go as he planned. This is a movie I had very low expectations for. I am not a big Andy Samberg fan and really only liked when he did the songs on SNL, that said I did laugh and liked this a lot more than I expected to. This is essentially a mock-umentary about a Justin Bieber type guy who is so disconnected from reality that it leads to hilarious outcomes. The songs in this are great, my favorite was the one about gay marriage. For someone that is not a fan of Samberg at all I have to admit I really enjoyed this and even though it started to drag and get repetitive this was still much better than I expected. Overall, somewhat of a fake documentary based on the guys that do the SNL songs, much better than I expected. I give this a B.",7,0,1,12 September 2016
Oblivion," A good movie that is worth seeing but seemed like a big collage of every other sci-fi movie ever made. I say B+
","'I can't shake the feeling that Earth, in spite of all that's happened, Earth is still my home.' Jack Harper (Cruise) is one of the last inhabitants of Earth. Years after a war decimated the planet him and his partner are left to protect the machines taking the water for use on the new home world. One day while he is out investigating something strange happens that changes his life and way of thinking. I was looking forward to this movie not because of Tom Cruise but because it looked interesting. While this is a very good movie and well worth seeing I had to laugh a few times. I don't want to give anything away but this movie is pretty much a mix of every single sci fi movie ever made. Each scene you think they did that in that one movie, or I saw that in that other movie. Serioulsy, think of a sci-fi movie and there is something in this one from that. The movie did have a kind of 80's feel to it which was cool and it is worth seeing but it's really just a collage of sci-fi from 2001 to After Earth (yes the movie that hasn't come out yet is even ripped off). Overall, well worth seeing and a fun game guessing what movie this scene is from. I give it a B+.",7,14,21,26 April 2013
Man of Steel," A fun and entertaining movie but not as good as I expected. Do not expect the feel of the Christopher Reeve movies. I say B.
","'You're not just anyone. One day, you're going to have to make a choice. You have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be. Whoever that man is, good character or bad, it's going to change the world.' After the imminent death of the planet Krypton, Jor-El (Crow) sends his only son to Earth in order to let him live. From the moment he arrives he notices he is different. When another survivor from the planet arrives and plans to destroy Earth it is up to Superman (Cavill) to save the world. I was super excited (get it) to see this movie. I think that may have hurt my enjoyment of it a little. While the movie is very good and has a much deeper and grown up story then the ones I grew up with it just didn't have the feel I wanted. The writer and director made Superman seem very human which is a neat idea but that also seem to hurt the movie in my opinion. The fight scenes were exciting but after awhile they started to feel very repetitive. The fight scenes also made Superman seem anything but super to me, which is my biggest problem with the movie. All that said the movie is entertaining and worth watching but I think my expectations were just a little too high. Overall, a good movie but do not expect the feel of the Christopher Reeve movies. I give it a B.",7,0,2,19 June 2013
The Revenant," One of the best movies of the year along with possibly the best performance of DiCaprio's career.
","'As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight.' Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) is leading a group of fur trappers through treacherous territory with the help of his son. While out scouting he comes across a pair of bear cubs, then the mother finds him. When he is found he is barely alive. Not wanting to leave him behind the group attempts to carry him to their destination but the mountains prove to be a obstacle. Two men agree to stay behind with him, but for different reasons. John Fitzgerald's (Hardy) greed gets the better of him and he kills Glass's son and leaves him for dead. Glass fights back and is now on a quest for revenge. There is only one thing to say about this movie. WOW. Intense, nerve wracking, infuriating, hopeful and inspiring all at the same time. DiCaprio is just incredible in this. He is captivating even though he doesn't speak for a lot of it. This is a movie I could just go on and on about but this is a film that just needs to be viewed and not talked about. The only real negative thing I can say about this is I don't think I could watch it again, it is just really too intense for repeated viewings. When you watch it yourself you will see what I mean. Overall, One of the best movies of the year along with possibly the best performance of DiCaprio's career. He has come a long way since Titanic. I give this an A.",9,0,2,22 January 2016
Trouble with the Curve," I was hoping for more of a 'Moneyball' type movie then this. I still really liked it and recommend it though. I say B+
","'Anybody who uses computers doesn't know a damn thing about this game.' Gus (Eastwood) was at one time the best scout in baseball. He is starting to get outdated as computers seem to be the new way of evaluating player talent. He is also starting to lose his eyesight and it makes it harder for him to see what a player can bring to the team. The problem is that he doesn't believe any of that. This first and foremost is a good and entertaining movie. Eastwood once again plays himself and once again it works. Amy Adams however steals the movie and if any one could be Eastwoods kid in a movie it is her. It was probably just my wishful thinking but I was hoping for this to be more of a baseball movie then it was. The movie was really good but it was more about Gus and Mickey's (Adams) relationship then baseball. That isn't a bad thing but I was hoping for another 'Moneyball' type movie. I do recommend this and this is a good time though. Overall, not what I was hoping for but still very good and I did like it. I give it a B+.",7,0,0,17 December 2012
Bridge of Spies," Hanks and Spielberg hit another home run. For a history buff like me this was one of the best movies of the year.
","'What's the next move when you don't know what the game is.' James B. Donovan (Hanks) is an insurance lawyer who has been chosen to defend a Russian accused of being a spy. He manages to make the entire country, including his firm, upset with him by the time the trial is over. After a US pilot is captured the US wants to facilitate an exchange of prisoners. Once again Donovan is enlisted to help, but his plans are different than what the government wants. First thing, this is a great movie. I really enjoyed this and was entertained by it the entire time. I will say there isn't a lot of action in this and the movie really had the feel of Lincoln. To me that's not a bad thing but just a heads up. Hanks is good as usual and really brings compassion to this role. The fact that this is based on true events makes the movie that much more exciting and tense. This is a movie that I highly recommend, but again may not be for everyone. Overall, Hanks and Spielberg hit another home run. For a history buff like me this was one of the best movies of the year. I give this a B+.",9,2,4,31 January 2016
Split," Easily Shyamalan's best movie since the Sixth Sense, and unlike that one, this is one you can watch more than once
","'We are what we believe we are.' Casey (Taylor-Joy) and her friends are having a fun day hanging out and shopping, then they are kidnapped by a man (McAvoy) with 23 distinct personalities. While the girls are trying to find a way to escape the kidnapper is on the verge of releasing a 24th and even more dangerous personality. This is a movie that is just flat out tense and good. The movie isn't straight horror as much as psychological and disturbing. The movie itself is almost a must see, but the real reason to watch is for McAvoy's performance. It's one of the best ever put on film. Being a Shyamalan movie I was trying to predict the crazy twist ending that he is known for, and of all my guesses I wasn't even close. That is the sign of a good movie. Overall, easily Shyamalan's best movie since the Sixth Sense, and unlike that one, this is one you can watch more than once. I give this an A.",9,1,7,1 May 2017
Kung Fu Panda 2," A kids movie that comes off as too adult. I didn't like it, and my kids were bored with it. First one was better. I say B-
","'Your story may not have such a happy beginning, but that doesn't make you who you are. it is the rest of your story, who you choose to be... So, who are you, Panda?' Po and his friends are back and this time they must stop an evil peacock from destroying kung-fu. Po must learn to deal with his past in order to once again save China and the art form. To me this movie and 'Cars 2' both had the same problem. Both were made as kids movies but with adult story lines. The problem with that is the adult aspect of it is too watered down for adults to take and the rest is not childish enough for the kids to really enjoy. I was never a fan of the first one but my kids were. Watching this one we all thought it was kinda boring. If they would have gone for more of Po hurting himself like the first one they would have liked it better. Sequels to kids movies try to actually be different from the first one, and that's why so many fail. Two and eight year olds don't care about stories they want up beat and funny, not a panda figuring out his past. Overall, a kids movie that tried to be to adult and didn't work. I give it a B-...my kids give it a B.",5,1,3,11 December 2011
Coriolanus," A very good movie that is worth watching. It did have the 'Shakespeare speak' in it & was, to me, hard to follow. I say B.
","'O, a kiss Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!' Rome is in the midst of a hunger problem and when it's hero Coriolanus (Fiennes) returns they think their problems are solved. After expressing his extreme views to it's people the politicians as well as his mother decide to banish him from the city. Angry and seeking revenge he decides to join the army of his sworn Tullus Aufidius (Butler) in hopes of exacting his revenge. I will start by saying that yes I knew this was a Shakespeare play going in. I also should tell you that I am not, nor really have ever been a fan of his. The preview I saw made me really want to see this though and I was excited. The movie itself was very good and interesting with a pretty timely (hundreds of years later) idea. All that said I had a hard time getting into it because while it was set in present day it still had the 'Shakespeare speak' and not being a big fan it was a little hard to understand in some parts. I did follow it enough to understand what was going on, but a few of the one-on-one emotional scenes really lost it's effect on me because I was trying to translate it in my mind and missed some of it. If you are a fan of this then you will probably love this. I, not being a fan, liked it but I think if it was spoken in 'normal English' I would have liked it more. Purists though probably hate that I said that, but I just can't get into it. Overall, a very good movie that Shakespeare fan's will absolutely love. I liked it enough though. I give it a B (because of the language).",7,2,6,27 May 2012
Hugo," A very well done & entertaining movie that won't appeal to everyone. A lot is happening throughout but doesn't feel like it. I say B+
","'Do you ever wonder where your dreams come from? Look around, this is where they are made.' Hugo Caberet spends his days winding clocks and searching for parts for his auto-man. After running into shop owner George Melies (Kingsley) and his daughter he is forced to reveal his secret to them, which sets off a chain of event that changes him and the city. I have to start by saying that this is not a movie for everyone. I really liked it but it is very slow moving and for the casual movie watcher it may seem like nothing happened. That statement may seem strange but after you watch it it will make sense to you. This is a movie that each scene builds on the next (like most Scorses's) and is hard to talk about without giving anything away but I will say that it is a movie that entertained me all the way through. I can see why the movie is up for 11 Oscars, but I will be surprised if it wins any of the major ones. Overall, a movie I really enjoyed, but again not for everyone. I give it a B+.",8,7,10,26 February 2012
Warrior," A very good movie that deserves to be compared with Rocky. My expectations were just a little too high I think. I say B+
","'You don't knock him out, you lose the fight. Understand me? You don't knock him out, you don't have a home.' After being away from home for a long long time Tommy (Hardy) comes back to see his father Paddy (Nolte). Across town his brother Brendan (Edgerton) is having financial troubles. The only way the two brothers can find a way to make the money they need is by fighting in an MMA tournament. Tommy asks his father to train him and the family dysfunction grows until the tournament. Regardless of what I say here this is a great movie. My problem with this is that I think my expectations were too high. Any movie that draws comparisons to 'Rocky' gets my hopes up (like 'The Fighter'). Much like 'Rocky' though, this movie has the fighting as a secondary plot to the family struggles that are going on. This movie is very interesting in the way that you are not sure who is the 'good' brother and are not really sure who to root for the entire time. If you have seen 'The Fighter' you may agree with me when I say that the movie was good but Christian Bale's performance made the movie. Nick Nolte gives that kind of performance in this one. He takes a part that could get glossed over and makes it stand out enough that to me he is the front runner for an Oscar. Overall, a very good movie but my expectations were too high to love it as much as I wanted. Of the last 'fighting' movies to come out I would have to say this is 3rd on my list. After 'The Wrestler' and 'The Fighter'. Still very much worth watching though. I give it a B+.*Also try - The Fighter & The Wrestler",8,1,3,18 December 2011
We're the Millers," Very funny & very much worth seeing a few times at least. Sudeikis & Aniston are great but Kenny steals the show. I say B+
","'He's actually really cool, he's a drug dealer.' David Clark (Sudeikis) is a drug dealer who is great at his job. One night while trying to do the right thing he loses all he has. When his boss finds out he gives him a way to pay him back. All he has to do is move a 'smidge' of pot across the Mexican border. Thinking that no one will stop a family in an RV he recruits a stripper, a homeless girl and a clueless boy and off they go. But it doesn't go as smooth as he expected. Comedies are the hardest to market I think. The goal of a trailer is to put enough in to make you want to see it but not give too much away. Most comedies fall into the trap of putting all the funny parts in the trailer and when you see the movie you are disappointed. While I would say that 80% of the trailers gives away all the funny parts the movie is still hilarious and very much worth seeing. Sudeikis is funny as always and Aniston is great in her role but the kid that plays Kenny really steals the movie and he is worth the price alone. There are some comedies that are funny the first time you see them then start to lose something with repeated watching. Some exceptions to me are Anchoman & Wedding Crashers. Those are funny every time I see them. While I don't think this is in the same class as those I still think it will be a long time before the humor is lost with repeated watching. Overall, very funny and very much worth seeing a few times at least. I give it a B+.",7,2,6,22 August 2013
Ender's Game," Fun & exciting. Geared toward teens but adults will like it as well. The violence isn't anything for parents to be worried about
","'In the moment when I truly understand my enemy. Understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him.' After an attack on Earth by an alien race the International Military Academy will do anything it take to keep it from happening again. Colonel Graff (Ford) is in charge of training and finding the future leaders. When he watches a young soldier named Ender Wiggin (Butterfield) he thinks he has found the future. I will do this review in two parts. First of all this is a fun and exciting movie that is geared toward teens but adults will like it as well. The effects are great and the violence isn't anything for parents to be worried about at all. For then entertainment factor alone I recommend this for all families. The second part is about a deeper meaning. I could be reading way too much into this and I don't mean to get political but the movie is kind of a metaphor for the Iraq war. I don't want to give anything away but if you go into it with that mindset you will see what I mean. I know the book it is based off of is older then the war but when you watch it you will see what I mean. Anyway what I'm trying to say is that this is a good family movie that I recommend. Overall, exciting and entertaining and me and my son both liked it. I give it a B+.",7,2,3,25 November 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Not terrible but nothing to rush and see. Would have been better if they made it funnier. Very over the top. I say C+
","'Me and my sister, we have a past. We almost died at the hands of a witch but that past made us stronger. We'd gotten a taste of blood, witch blood and we haven't stopped since.' After escaping and killing a witch as young kids Hansel (Renner) and Gretel (Arterton) have become bounty hunters specializing in witch hunting. They are hired by a town mayor to protect them, but the sheriff doesn't trust them. It is up to the brother and sister team to save the town from it's fate. I was a little leery of this going in. After sitting through it I have to say it was about what I expected. A lot of over the top acting and gore strung together with a little story. The movie isn't terrible but I don't think it's worth seeing more then once. The evil witch makeup is a cross between something in Labrynth and Army Of Darkness. To me I think the movie could have been a little better if they made it more of a comedy/horror then just straight horror. That's just my opinion though. I'm sure many people will really like this. Overall, not terrible but nothing to rush and see either. I say C+.",6,0,2,26 April 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Very good movie with great acting. Mara is fantastic. I didn't think it was as good as original. I say B.
","'I want you to help me catch a killer of women.' Disgraced journalist Mikael Blomqvist (Craig) is asked by a man named Henrik Vanger (Plummer) to find his nieces killer who committed the crime 40 years ago. He receives help from the eccentric Lisbeth Salander (Mara) who has her own motives. I had contradicting feelings going into this one. I really loved the original (I haven't read any of the books though) but I was worried about how this one would be but was very excited to see it. I though the casting was perfect but the original Lisbeth was so tremendous that I couldn't see how this could be as good. One of the first things I noticed was how similar Mara looked to the original actress. As the movie went on I started seeing more and more similarities to the original. I realize that this is based off a book so they will be similar but this to me felt like almost a shot for shot remake. It's been a while since I saw the original but it felt like almost the exact same thing. All that said though the original seemed better to me, I don't know what this was missing but I don't think it was as good. I did like this movie though. Overall, not as good as original but very close. I give it a B.",7,1,7,21 March 2012
Bad Teacher," A funny movie but didn't live up to expectations. Diaz was funny, but Aniston in 'Horrible Bosses' was better. I say B
","'I don't need a blackboard or a classroom to set an example.' After being dumped by her fiancé Elizabeth (Diaz) decides to go back to teaching, but she is no longer interested in it. When a new teacher (Timberlake) shows up she makes it her goal to get him. This is another movie that the enjoyment is affected by your expectations. The higher your expectations the more you will be disappointed. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie at all, it is still really funny, but with all the hype behind this one it fell short of what I was hoping for. The writing was very funny and I did laugh a lot during this movie, but compared to Jennifer Aniston in 'Horrible Bosses', Diaz was not as shocking or over the top as I was hoping for. Jason Segal was great, and Timberlake was actually really funny in this movie as well. Overall, a funny movie that is worth watching, but just make sure you tone down your expectations.

The Amazing Spider-Man," A totally un-original and basically unneeded movie. A reboot that has nothing different from original. I say B-.
","'If you could do good things for other people you had a moral obligation to do those things. That's what at stake here, not choice, responsibility.' After mysterious circumstances causes Peter Parker's (Garfield) parents to leave him with his aunt and uncle he is left to wonder what happened. Now in high school Peter is still wondering why. After meeting an old friend of his father's he begins to think he may have an answer and helps him with a scientific equation that has very, very bad side effects...for all involved. I was never really a big fan of the Sam Raimi 'Spider-Man' movies. To me they were too cheesy. I was looking forward to this one because it seemed darker then those. While this did feel more grown up it was still nothing like I was expecting. I think my big problem with it is that it was so much like the other series that the movie didn't feel like it was needed at all. This isn't a fair comparison but the Chris Nolan 'Batman' series was much, much different from the Tim Burton series that the re-boot felt fresh and original. This one just felt like...hey let's do 'Spider-Man' again...OK. This may just be my opinion but there is nothing new and fresh in this movie compared to the others and to me that seems like a waste of a movie. This again though is a movie that people will watch regardless of any review written, but just so you don't get your hopes up don't really expect anything different or amazing. Overall, if you liked the other series then you will probably like this one, since it's basically the same movie. I give it a B-.",6,2,4,4 November 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," Good movie that should be seen & it does deserve all the accolades the actors are getting but I liked Puncture more.
","'I ain't selling drugs no more counselor. I'm giving them away by selling memberships...you get all the meds you want...welcome to the Dallas Buyers Club.' Ron Woodruff (McConaughey) is a stereotypical redneck in the 80's. He is racist and homophobic, and in between getting drunk works as an electrician at a construction site. When a work accident lands him in the hospital he is told that he is HIV positive and has 30 days to live. This changes his whole world, his old friends are replaced by new friends, he changes his out look on life and is now doing everything he can to help others like him. Even if that means skirting the law. After all the talk about the performances in this movie I was excited to see it. They were great but I think that skewed the way people felt about the movie. I'm not denying that McConaughey and Leto deserve awards, because they do but I wouldn't consider this an amazing movie. Don't get me wrong though, this is a good movie and should be seen and I think it does deserve all the accolades that the actors are getting but the movie Puncture just had a grittier feel to it and I liked that one more. I know the two really don't have that much more in common then one man trying to change the system while dealing with a drug problem but that one made me care more about the main character. While Ron does have some good qualities that come out in the end you have a hard time liking him. Overall, a good movie with great acting that should be seen. I give it a B.",7,1,4,7 January 2014
Goon," For a huge hockey fan like me this is an instant classic. Funnier then 'Slap Shot'. Watch this, very very funny. I give it a B+
","'You're not here to play hockey, you're here to fight.' Doug Glatt's(Scott) life is going nowhere. His parents are not proud of him and he doesn't like his bouncing job. When him and his friend Ryan (Baruchel) go to a local hockey game to relax Doug gets into a fight with a player. After the coach sees the fight he signs Doug to the team. He has now found a purpose in life...a hockey goon. I have to admit that I am a huge hockey fan. Growing up in Detroit and having half my family from Montreal you could say it's in my blood. I really liked the movie 'Slap Shot' but until now there has never really been a great hockey comedy. This ranks up with 'Major League' in terms of great sports comedies. Not only does this movie have great quotable lines and great fight scenes it also has heart. I don't know if it was the hockey fan in me but I really liked this movie and laughed all the way through, plus it's a true story which makes it that much better. Overall, if you liked 'Slap Shot' you will love this movie. To me it's an instant classic sports comedy. Very funny. I give it a B+",8,1,2,22 March 2012
Now You See Me," Super fun and entertaining. All the fun of the Ocean's series with the feel of the Prestige. Watch this movie. I say A-
","'The more you look, the less you see.' Four of the best magicians in the country are given a mysterious card telling them to meet at a certain place at a certain time. One year later they are known as the four horsemen and they begin to stage the biggest tricks of their lives, the first of which involves robbing a bank. When the FBI begins to question them the four magicians elude them and stay ahead of everyone trying to stop them pulling off bigger and more impressive tricks. I have said before that expectations have a huge impact on how much you enjoy a movie. If you have high expectations you are usually disappointed and vice versa. This is a rare exception where I had high expectations going in and still really enjoyed this. The movie has all the fun of an Ocean's movie with the writing of a movie like the Prestige. While this is pretty much a heist movie it has an original twist on the genre and the movie sucks you in right away and keeps you watching right up until the end, which seems to come too soon. The cast is perfect and the movie is very entertaining. I highly recommend this and it is one of the best I have seen this year. Overall, all the fun of the Ocean's Eleven series with a more serious tone. I loved it. I give this an A-.",9,4,10,19 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Any other movies made will only hurt what has been done in this one. This is the best in the series & a great closing.
","'Just because someone stumbles and loses their way doesn't mean they're lost forever.' The human race has had enough of the mutants and they create Sentinels that can not be destroyed and only kill the mutant race. With their numbers dwindling and fearing for their own death Professor X and Magneto decide there is only one way to stop the genocide. They risk everything on an idea that if they send Wolverine (Jackman) back in time to stop Mystique (Lawrence) from killing the creator of the Sentinels then the war will not happen. He has to convince the young Professor and Magneto to work together to make this happen or the mutant race will cease to exist. I was never a fan of this series until I watched First Class. I loved that movie and decided to re-watch the others. After seeing them again I held firm that First Class was the best in the series by far. I had high expectations for this one and I have to say that I finally changed my mind. This one is easily the best movie in the series. It is rare for a comic book movie to have a fully fleshed out plot, character development and great acting all in one but this one did. This one felt like a legitimate movie with superheroes rather then 'lets see how many effects we can toss into this to make it look cool'. The movie was so well done and really combined the two generations together in a way that wasn't hokey at all. Even if you aren't a fan of comic book movies you should watch this. You will really enjoy it. Like I said after The Dark Knight Rises if the studio is smart they would close the book on this franchise because of the way this ended. Going any further will not only diminish the franchise but will begin to ruin what they have done with this movie. Overall, an excellent ending to the saga and if anyone with these movies cares about the franchise at all this will be the end of it. Any other movies made will only hurt what has been done so far.

Captain America: Civil War," As a stand alone movie this is good, as part of the series it lacks the drama that I like in my movies.
","'I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.' After another attempt to save the world ends in destruction Steve (Evans) and Tony (Downey Jr.) are on opposite sides of what to do in the future. Tony feels that the superhero's should not be given free reign, while Steve feels that they should be able to act as they see fit. When an old enemy surfaces allegiances are put to the test, and the end of the Avengers could be near. This is a movie that is basically review proof but I'll do one anyway. First of all, I'll say this is a good movie full of action, comedy and excitement, like all of the other Avengers movies. The big problem I have with this movie, like I have stated with all of the other movies in this series, is that it lacks real drama. By that I mean, because there is already the announcement of 2 more Avenger movies means that you know how it will end going in, this one had a chance to go dark and really change the game for this series, but once again, it got wrapped in a bow and left me feeling like this is just another in the line of movies made in order to make money and not offer drama. I liked Batman v Superman because of the drama. That movie did have major flaws, but because it ended with the death of a major character. Even though they are coming back for the next movie it set a precedent that makes you go into the next one wondering who won't make it out alive. I'm not a big fan of comic book movies, but the ones I do like are dark, gritty, and makes you wonder what is going to happen. To me the Marvel movies don't. As a stand alone movie this is good, as part of the series it lacks the drama that I like in my movies. Overall, another in the line of the Avengers movies that people will love, I don't.

The Conjuring 2," The relaxed pace and feel really adds to the overall tenseness and I recommend this for horror movie fans
","'After everything we've seen there isn't much that rattles either of us anymore, but this one, this one still haunts me.' After investigating the possession of the Amityville house affects their lives in ways they can't shake Ed (Wilson) and Lorraine (Farmiga) Warren decide to end their career of investigation. After a similar event happens in England the church asks them to travel to the house and decide if the church should get involved. What they find is more terrifying than either has experienced but are struggling to find proof that the events are real. I was actually looking forward to this movie. I am not a big fan of horror (or more specifically gore) but I did like the first one as well as Annabelle. The type of movies that creep me out are the ones that are more psychological and feel as if they could really happen. This is one of those movies. It did get a little repetitive, but the tenseness and creepy aspects really worked throughout and the movie did make me feel uneasy at times. It is becoming clear that horror movie directed by James Wan will be tense and really what horror should be. Creepy and disturbing without cutting people up or trying to hard. The relaxed pace and feel really adds to the overall tenseness and I recommend this for horror movie fans. Overall, one of the best horror movies to come out since the original Conjuring. I give this a B+.",8,0,0,12 September 2016
Jackie," Portman is amazing in this & the film really adds a rarely discussed aspect about this story. This is not your typical JFK movie.
","'For one brief shining moment there was Camelot.' Jackie Kennedy (Portman) has just lost her husband. When a reporter shows up at her house to interview her he isn't sure what to expect. She begins to relate to him the events after the assassination, how she was feeling and how she planned the funeral. This is a movie I was really looking forward to. I am huge into history and specifically into the Kennedy Assassination events. The only problem with movies about JFK is that they tend to keep repeating themselves without adding all that much to what has already been discussed. There have been three that stand out as being different and actually different. One is JFK, dealing with the court case. Recently, Parkland added a whole new dimension as it focused on the peripheral players and not the assassination itself. This one is added to that list. This movie deals with a subject not covered before. The movie follows Jackie from the time of the shooting through the funeral. How and why she planned it the way she did, and other emotional aspects that I never really thought about. Portman absolutely owns this roll and I am really shocked she didn't win the Oscar. The movie is about an event everyone knows about, but her performance is so perfect that it makes it feel real and more emotional than any other movie I have seen about this subject. There are a few technical aspects I don't think were accurate but that aside this is a movie that I can not recommend more. Overall, Portman is amazing in this movie and this film really adds a rarely discussed aspect about this story. This is not your typical JFK movie. I loved it. I give this an A+.",10,3,7,6 March 2017
No Strings Attached," A very funny chick-flick that both men and women will enjoy. Nothing new but still very entertaining. I say B+
","Can you really ever be just 'friends with benefits'? After a drunken adventure ends with Adam (Kutcher) naked on Emma's (Portman) couch they decide to strike a deal. When Adam wants something more the problems begin. This is a chick flick that many guys will also enjoy. A little more girlie then I was expecting, but still a really, really funny movie. The movie is pretty raunchy in some parts and you will find it difficult not to laugh. If you are looking for a chick flick that your boyfriend/husband will watch with you this is a great choice. If you are looking for a movie for your girlfriend/wife that will not be two hours of torture for you this is a great choice. Very, very funny for both sexes, enough romance for the ladies, and enough comedy for the men. A perfect movie for date night. A little predictable, but most romantic comedies are. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - I actually would.*Also try - Going The Distance & Love And Other Drugs",7,17,33,10 May 2011
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," I'm sure fans of this series will really enjoy this but I had a hard time getting into it. I'm not a Tolkein fan though
","'You've changed Bilbo Baggins. You're not the same hobbit as the one who left the Shire.' After making it through the Misty Mountains, Bilbo (Freeman) and company must now make it through the dangerous Mirkwood Forest, this time without the help of Gandalf (Mckellen). When they arrive at the Laketown settlement Bilbo is told how to fulfill his dwarven contract. He must retrieve an artifact guarded by the deadly dragon Smaug. I will begin by saying that I was not a fan of the original Lord Of The Rings movies but did think the first Hobbit movie was good. I have just never really been of fan of the books or the movies so that will weigh into my judgment. That said I thought the last half hour of this one was exciting but up until then I found it much harder to get into then I did with the first Hobbit. I'm not sure why but historically the 2nd movie in a trilogy is usually the weakest one (Empire Strikes Back is the exception). I'm sure fans of this series will really enjoy this but I had a hard time getting into it. I am looking forward to the third one though due to the way this one ended and that I thought the Return Of The King was the best in the original trilogy. Overall, fans of the series will like this way more then I did, at least I think they will. I give this a B.",6,5,6,5 April 2014
To Rome With Love," A typical Woody Allen type comedy. Four major story lines going on. If you like his style you will like this movie. I say B-
","'In this city all is a story.' Much like any Woody Allen movie this movie has multiple story lines. A man trying to revisit his past in the city he grew up in. A newlywed couple having troubles during their honeymoon. A semi-retired opera producer trying to find the next big star and a man who gets what he wants, only to find out the phrase 'be careful what you wish for' is true. There isn't much to say about this movie to convince you to watch or not watch. This is a Woody Allen movie and he has a built in audience already. On the other hand he also has a real style that turns people off and they won't watch because it is a Woody Allen movie. I thought this was OK and I am not a Allen fan at all. I really liked his last movie (Midnight In Paris) but this one was more of his older style and more quirky and I just don't like his style of humor. Also just as a heads up half the movie is in Italian with subtitles (in case that bothers you). I thought the movie is OK but definitely Woody's style of comedy. Overall, if you like Woody Allen you will like this movie, if not you may not. I give it a B-.",6,0,1,14 January 2013
Bridesmaids," A funny movie, but would have been better if I say it earlier. Did not live up to the hype. Still worth watching. I say B
","'Why can't you be happy for me and then go home and talk about me behind my back like a normal person?' After being asked to be the maid of honor to her friend Lillian (Rudolph), Annie's (Wiig) life that is already in disarray becomes even more so. After thinking she is being replaced as best friend she tries too hard to compensate. Almost ruining the wedding in the process. This movie has what I call the 'Due Date' or 'Hangover' curse. Like those movies, the first people to see it, before the hype and word of mouth got out of control think this is great and hilarious. People like me who have waited a little too long and have outrageous expectations are left disappointed. Going in thinking this is the female 'Hangover' I was excited. While I can see the comparisons, it was more chick-flicky then I was expecting. While this did have funny parts and I did laugh it wasn't as good as expected. Overall, this is a good movie, but because of the expectations I had I didn't like it as much as I thought. I give it a B.Would I watch again? - I might, just to see if it's better the second time.*Also try - Something Borrowed & The Sweetest Thing",Null,0,2,3 September 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," I was not a fan of the original trilogy. That said I did really enjoy this one. More action then walking which helped. I say B+.
","'My dear Frodo, you asked me once if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures. Well, I can honestly say I've told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it.' Bilbo Baggins (Freeman) is living his life quiet and alone, just like he likes when one day a wizard named Gandolf (Mckellen) shows up with an offer to join him and his group of dwarfs on an adventure. His reluctance finally gives way and he sets out on an adventure that will change his life forever. I have to be honest and admit that I was not a fan of the Lord Of The Rings movies. I thought the first one was boring. The second one to me was a bad remake of Army Of Darkness (I know, go ahead and judge). I did think the third one was OK but not worthy of best picture. All that said I was not looking forward to watching this one. I open with that to say that I actually enjoyed this one. There was actually action in this and not as much constant walking. I know this is a movie people will either see or not see no matter what reviews say but as a person who did not like the original Lord Of The Rings trilogy I did like this one, I hope that helps in your decision. Overall, to me this was better then all three of the other movies. I give it a B+.",7,1,4,17 March 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Anderson's movies keep getting better (although I liked Rushmore the most) but are still really only for a select few.
","'I knew there was something fishy. We never got the cause of death. She's been murdered and you think I did it.' Gustave H (Fiennes) is a concierge at the legendary Grand Budapest Hotel. He is the best at what he does and receives respect from everyone. After one of his frequent guests dies she leaves him a rare and expensive painting in her will. When it turns out that he is the prime suspect in her death him and his young protégé set off on an adventure avoiding the cops and trying to find the real killer. Wes Anderson is one of the most original directors to come along but most people either love or hate his work. This one will do nothing to change that. He just isn't a main stream type guy and that's OK. Much like Woody Allen he has a niche and plays that up. There isn't really much else to say about this one. If you like Wes Anderson movies you will like this one, if you don't you won't. Overall, Anderson's movies keep getting better (although I liked Rushmore the most) but they are still really only for a select few. I did like this though. I give it a B.",7,1,4,12 June 2014
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," An absolutely hilarious movie that is so much fun to watch. Fans of Zombieland will love this. Great fun. I say A-
","'This has been one big misunderstanding.' Tucker (Tudyk) and Dale (Labine) have hit the jackpot. Buying a vacation home they drive out to begin to fix it up. While out fishing they watch as a young college girl slips and falls in the water. When they go over to help her, her friends run away. When she wakes up she realizes that she is in no danger, but her friends don't know that and the set out to rescue her. This is one of the biggest surprises of the year. Easily one of the funniest movies to come out, and the only comedy/horror movie I have seen that can compete with 'Shaun Of The Dead' and 'Zombieland'. The plot and dialog are hilarious and will have you laughing at stuff you wouldn't normally laugh at, like when a kid is ground up by a woodchopper. Which is followed by the line 'You ain't never gonna get that deposit back now.' For fans of 'Shaun' or 'Zombieland' this is right up your ally. For those that aren't you may still like this one. Very, very funny and the rare movie that you can put it and enjoy over and over. Definitely worth a watch. Overall, one of the funniest movies of the year. If you like 'Idle Hands' you will love this movie. Gory good fun. I give it an A-.Would I watch again? - I absolutely would.*Also try - Rubber & Zombieland",Null,1,1,16 October 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Almost as good as the original. A great and fun action movie that is a joy to watch. Pegg is great. I say B+
","'Your mission, should you choose to accept it...' After a mission goes south and the Kremlin is attacked and partially destroyed the IMF division is blamed. This event causes the government to cut all ties with the agency. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team of now independent agents are in a race to stop a mad man from starting a nuclear war and prove that the IMF is innocent. I have to admit that I have liked all the movies in this franchise (except the 2nd one) and was looking forward to this one. After a long hiatus I have to admit that the series is back with a vengeance. The action and gadgets were great as always and this one seemed more real then the others to me. There were a few call back shots to the other movies which made it more interesting to me. The addition of Simon Pegg really was brilliant and he was my favorite part of this movie. Jeremy Renner is one good character away from being the star of his own franchise and I have a feeling that will happen soon. This is a must see for all action fans, not just fans of the series. Overall, not quite as good as the first one but this has come the closest of all the sequels so far. I give it a B+.",7,0,1,14 April 2012
Foxcatcher," A very creepy and unsettling performance by @SteveCarell. Very much worth seeing, if for no other reason than his performance.
","'I want more than anything to win a gold medal...and I think you and I working in tandem, we can get him there.' John du Pont (Carell) is an eccentric millionaire who loves his country and wrestling. He wants nothing more than to my the coach of an Olympic gold medalist and thinks he finds the perfect candidate in Mark Schultz (Tatum). What starts off as a perfect paring begins to strain when Mark's brother joins the team. There is no way to talk about this movie without talking first about the performance by Steve Carell. He is known primarily as a comic actor so he was an interesting choice to play someone as off kilter as du Pont. The fact that it was him though made the character that much creepier. The make-up is so good that it is easy for you not to think of Carell in the role and it adds to the impact of the movie. The way he plays du Pont is so unsettling. Prolonged stares and pauses really make you feel uncomfortable for almost the entire movie, and that is a good thing. I remember when the actual events happened but that did not detract from the enjoyment of the movie at all. I also have to admit that Channing Tatum did a fantastic job in this and I really think it should have been him rather then Ruffalo who should have been nominated for this movie. The movie is very creepy and very well done but not as good as I was hoping for. Overall, a very good movie with great acting, the only downside is that is seems to slow down a little toward the end. That said I do still highly recommend this movie if for no other reason than to watch Steve Carrell. I give it a B+.",7,1,2,2 March 2015
It Follows," Nothing amazing or super scary, but this was a surprisingly good and fun movie that is worth seeing.
","'It could be someone you know or a stranger in a crowd. Whatever helps it get close to you. It can look like anyone.' Jay (Monroe) is finally out on a date with the boy she likes. After an intimate encounter he says something to her and her life changes. Now followed by visions only she can see she must find a way to stop the horror before its too late. This is a difficult movie to talk about. There were scenes in this that were pretty tense and exciting, some of it was a little generic and some scenes made me laugh out loud. All that put together however did make this a fun movie to watch and when it was over I was left feeling happy that I saw this. This is not the scariest movie I have seen, but it's very entertaining and just a fun movie to watch. I was happy that this was a horror movie that didn't rely on the 'found-footage' aspect that so many have been turning to lately. Overall, nothing amazing or super scary, but this was a surprisingly good and fun movie that is worth seeing. I liked it quite a bit. I give this a B.",7,7,17,26 May 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," One of the best movies of the year, and a rare movie that lives up to the hype. A must see. I easily say A
","'At age 3, Caesar has completed puzzles ages 8 and up. He has been displaying cognitive skills that far exceed that of a human counterpart.' Will (Franco) has been working on a cure for Alzheimer's. He tests his experiments on apes, and thinks that he has finally found what he is looking for. When one dies during the test he is left to take care of her baby. When he takes the little ape home he begins to notice things that aren't normal. This is another movie that exploded in the theaters and I waited to see it till just the other day. What I have noticed lately is that the longer you wait to see a movie this popular it never lives up to what you expect. When everyone says how good the movie is and it's the best movie they have seen your expectations are too high and it always disappoints. This is the exception. This is truly a great movie that is an absolute must see. I did not like the Marky-Mark 'Planet Of The Apes' but this one is nothing like that one. This one actually has a story that keeps you interested and you are hooked in from the beginning. The most amazing part of this movie is that there are large chunks of the movie where there is no dialog at all and until someone says something you don't really notice. This movie sucks you in and keeps hold of you until the ending. A must see. Overall, one of the few movies that can actually live up to the hype it has gotten. I easily give it an A.*Also try - Planet Of The Apes",Null,1,5,16 November 2011
Legend," This is a movie that I really enjoyed and highly recommend but the reason to watch is for the dual role played by Hardy
","'The Queen would survive, but God save the rest of us.' London in the 1960's was run by two twin gangsters, Reggie and Ron Kray (Hardy). Nothing happened without them knowing or allowing it. Reggie was calculating and deadly while Ron was a little psychotic and unstable. Eventually they only thing that could challenge their reign was each other. As many of you know by now I am a HUGE fan of gangster and mafia movies. I was looking forward to this one for that reason. I like Tom Hardy but never really got all the hype around him, until now. He was so good in this that it almost actually hurt the movie. He plays both brothers perfectly and to the point of you forgetting its the same actor. The dialog and intonation of his voice is even different. I've never seen anything like it and half the time I was staring at them, going back and forth trying to see similarities and failing. It also made me wonder if the movie would have been as good if it had not been for him. What it came down to was it doesn't matter, he is in it and I was just mesmerized by his acting in this. I say distracting because as good as this movie was all I could talk about was his performance, that isn't a bad thing though. Overall, this is a movie that I really enjoyed and highly recommend but the reason to watch is for the dual role played by Hardy. I give this movie a high B+.",8,5,7,26 February 2016
Behind The Candelabra," A bio-pic that is worth seeing and I thought was good but the performance by Douglas was great. Watch for him. I say B
","'I want to be everything to you Scott. I want to be father, brother, lover, best friend.' This is the true story of Scott Thorson (Damon) and his relationship with the one and only Liberace (Douglas). Scott was a normal easy going gay man with a dream to become a vet. That all changed when he met Liberace. The small town boy became a drug addicted, paranoid, and revenge obsessed man. I wasn't totally sure what to expect from this movie. I knew very little about the real Liberace and nothing about this story at all. The movie shows the rise and fall Scott and the extreme things he goes through for the man he loves. The story is pretty interesting but the real reason to watch is the performance of Michael Douglas. He is great in this and turns himself completely into the character that he makes you forget you are watching a famous actor like Michael Douglas. Overall, a pretty interesting bio-pic that I thought was pretty good but the performance by Douglas is great. I give it a B.",6,1,3,8 July 2013
Gone Girl," This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time & I highly recommend it. Keeps you guessing all the way to the end.
","'You married a complete psychopath.' Nick (Affleck) is a struggling bar owner and teacher who hasn't been happy in his marriage for awhile. Amy (Pike) is his wife who is a very successful writer and is trying to keep the marriage together. When Nick comes home and sees signs of a struggle and Amy gone he is worried and wants to find her. When Nick becomes the primary suspect he tries everything he can to clear his name and find out what happened to his wife. This is a movie that you can not talk about too much because it would be an injustice to give anything away. What I can say though is that I have been watching around 7-10 movies a week in order to do these reviews and have gotten to the point where after 5 minutes I can predict exactly what is going to happen and 99% of the time I am right. This is a movie that stayed one step ahead of me the entire time and just when I thought I had it figured out it went another way. That added to the enjoyment of this and I just can not say enough about this movie. This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long long time and I highly recommend this.

Django Unchained," Tarantino's best movie. Foxx and Dicaprio are great in this. A few cringe worthy scenes but I highly recommend. I say A-.
","'You want to save your wife by doing what I do? This is what I do, I kill people and sell their corpses for cash.' Django (Foxx) is a slave being moved to a new plantation when dentist/bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz finds him and frees him needing his help on a bounty. After getting to know each other they strike up a deal, work together for the winter making enough money so they can buy and free Django's wife from her owner. I will start by saying that I have thought Tarantino's movies are good but I am not a huge fan. Unlike most I think Reservoir Dogs is his best, not Pulp Fiction but overall I think he is a little overrated. I was looking forward to seeing this one mainly because of Jamie Foxx. About halfway in I started to change my opinion. This is far and away Tarantino's best movie. The writing is fantastic and the style is defiantly him with a few cringe worthy moments but this is a movie that I really enjoyed and I highly recommend. Foxx is great in this and DiCaprio plays such a good bad guy that he should get more roles like this. The only bad thing I have to say about this is that it is a little long, but it does hold your attention for the most part and this is one of the best movies of the year. Overall, Tarantino's best movie and I highly recommend this...if you can handle it. I give it an A-.",8,2,6,14 April 2013

Almost immediately Chris feels something is strange with the family and the longer he stays the more bizarre and terrifying things become. This is one of the most disturbing movies I have seen in a long time. There are horror movies and then there are movies like this. This movie is very real that's what makes it disturbing. The movie deals with race issues in a way that may make some people uncomfortable, but that's the point of the movie. This is a movie that is one that needs to be seen, talked about and understood in ways that horror movies usually aren't. This is not just a horror movie it is an important film that I recommend.

He only drives, doesn't carry a gun and has a specific time frame he operates in. When his neighbors husband gets released from jail he finds him beat up and bloody with his son. Realizing that there is only one way to help him he decides to drive for him, until something goes wrong. I went in expecting 'Transporter' with Ryan Gosling. I was wrong. While I did like that movie this one was much better. This movie actually had more of a plot and more tension I thought. While 'Transporter' was more action based this one was more story and character based. There were large chunks without dialog but the performances were so good that you knew what they were 'saying'. There are some strong graphic violence scenes in this but I have to say this was much different then I expected. Much better also. Overall, very much worth watching and much better then I expected.

Thinking that a fall from a ladder as landed their son Dalton in a coma, Josh & Renai Lambert (Wilson & Byrne) are shocked to learn that their son may be possessed instead. When told of a way to bring him back the family will risk everything to get their son back. Let me start by saying I am not scared very easy at all in movies. I can count on one hand the movies that have actually scared me. Saying that the ones that have scared me include 'Poltergeist', 'Paranormal Activity 1' and ' The Exorcism Of Emily Rose'. I say that to tell you that this movie is a lot like those three put together. Which is why this is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. Take that statement as you will, but this movie had me sitting up with the lights on for almost the entire time. I'm actually a little surprised that this movie is only PG-13, but that just shows how desensitized we are getting to horror. One of the best things this movie has going for it is that it is scary without being gory. This movie creeped the hell out of me, and I loved every minute of it. Overall, I would call this 'Paranormal Activity' meets 'Poltergeist' mixed with 'What Dreams May Come', with a dash of whatever will make you scream. Watch this, but not alone. I give it an A-.Would I watch again? - Maybe, but not soon.*Also try - Paranormal Activity 1 & 2 & Poltergeist",8,0,1,9 July 2011
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," A movie that hits you on a very personal level & makes you look at your life and how you live it. I really loved it
","'Let's make every moment count starting now.' Walter Mitty (Stiller) is a boring unadventurous man who daydreams all day and works for LIFE magazine. When he finds out the magazine is publishing it's final issue all he has to do is find the negative for the final cover. This turns out to be a life changing experience and Walter Mitty finally discovers who he is. I have to admit that I was not excited about watching this going in. The trailer seemed boring to me and I am not a big Ben Stiller fan. I am not too proud to admit when I'm wrong and I was way off the mark on this one. From the opening scene you get to know and feel for Walter and during the course of the movie you root for him and share his experiences with him as if they were your own. Walter Mitty is the type of guy we all relate to and that's what makes this such a good movie. By the end he becomes someone we all wish we could be. This is not just a good movie its a very inspiring movie that needs to be seen by anyone unsure of themselves, and really who isn't? I highly recommend this movie and this is Ben Stiller's best work yet. Overall, a movie that hits you on a very personal level and makes you look at you life and how you live it.

The Bourne Legacy," No Damon but that doesn't mean it's not good. A worthy addition to series. I liked it but liked 3rd one more. I say B+
","'Jason Bourne was just the tip of the iceberg.' After trying to cover up and take care of the Jason Bourne problem the agents of TREADSTONE have another problem to deal with. When too much classified Intel gets out and the two heads of the project are seen together too often the decision is made to scrap the project and rebuild later. One by one the agents are canceled until the agents think they are safe. One has survived and Aaron Cross (Renner) isn't ready to end his mission yet. I have liked all of the movies in this series but have never really been obsessed with them. I was looking forward to this one because of Jeremy Renner and I was interested in what they will do with the series without Damon. I have to say that I was impressed and really did enjoy this movie. The only downside to it is that it really is nothing all that different from the other movies in the series. For fans of the series who are afraid to see this because of Damon not being in it don't worry, this is a worthy addition to the series. Overall, very good continuation to the franchise, but I thought the 'Bourne Ultimatum' was still better. Very much worth seeing though. I give it a B+.",8,8,14,16 August 2012
22 Jump Street," There are some definite funny parts in this and I did laugh a lot throughout but this one felt a little more flat then the original.
","'We have to stop treating this like it's exactly the same as last time.' After taking down the drug dealers in high school Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are reassigned to college. They are tasked with finding the dealer that is giving drugs to students before the drug goes viral. They go undercover as students in order to find out who is dealing. Soon after starting school girls and friends start to effect the partnership and threaten the case. The biggest problem with sequels is that they try and do the same thing as the original but they change just enough so it's not as good as the original. While that did happen with this one I have to admit that one of the best parts is that they don't try to hide from it. The movie opens in the chiefs office where he explains that because of the success of the first time they teamed up they are doing it again. A very literal reference to the first movie and he goes on to explain that what is going to happen in this one is the exact same thing as the first one. For some reason that made the repetition not bug me at all. As for the rest of the movie though I was a little disappointed. I thought the first one was better, but again sequels are never really as good. There are some definite funny parts in this and I did laugh a lot throughout but this one felt a little more flat then the original. Overall, a movie that was funny but not as good as the first one.

Unknown," Very entertaining and tense action thriller. Not quite 'Taken 2' but almost as good. Liam Neesen can really kick ass. I say B+
","'Do you know what it feels like to become insane Dr.? It's like a war between being told who you are and knowing who you are.' When Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) realizes he left his briefcase in the Berlin airport during a hotel check in he grabs a cab and heads back for it. An accident occurs and he wakes up in a hospital four days later. When he finally realizes who he is he heads back to find his wife. When she claims to have never seen him before and meets the man that says he is him Dr. Harris begins his quest to reveal the truth. This is the best kind of action-thriller movie. Just when you think you have the truth figured out a twist happens and you are left guessing again. To talk more about the movie itself will give too much away, but I am usually very good at predicting the ending to movies, but this one got me. Liam Neeson is excellent at playing parts like this and I hope he continues to do it. The supporting cast is also excellent, as is the writing. Very entertaining movie. Not quite as fun as 'Taken', but it's also a different kind of movie. Overall, a must see for action fans, will keep you guessing all the way until the end. I say B+.Would I watch it again? - I absolutely would, to see if I can catch clues I missed the first time.*Also try - Memento & The Next Three Days",8,0,1,21 June 2011
X-Men: Apocalypse," Tops the previous one in every way possible. This series is close to as brilliant and classic as the Dark Knight trilogy.
","'Some believe that the first mutant was born thousands of years ago. He was some kind of god, and he's going to rise again.' Years after the events of the last movie the X-Men members have gone their own way and are no longer the group they once were. Eric (Fassbender) is living life quietly in Poland with a wife and daughter. Charles is still running the school and training new students every day. Things are going smooth until an ancient evil is awoken and the future of the world is threatened. Once again the X-Men must band together to save the world, but this time things get complicated because Eric is fighting against them. After watching Days of Future Past I said that they should end this franchise. The time line aspect was so perfectly done and I felt that any further movie would ruin what was done. I have really like the Newer X-Men movies and even though I thought they shouldn't have made more I still went to see this one. Once again I have to admit that I was wrong. I loved First Class and didn't know how they could do better, and they did with Days of Future Past. This one tops both of those as well. The movie is funny, tense, has a strong grip on reality while still being a comic book movie. The cast is so perfect in this and the new additions are seamlessly added and really add to the feel and excitement. It is very hard for a series to consistently top itself but this one pulls it off perfectly. The sequel curse seems to be missing this series all together. Do yourself a favor and watch this today. Overall, once again, this movie tops the previous one in every way possible. This series is close to as brilliant and classic as Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. I give this an A+.",10,11,18,13 June 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," To me Spider-man has always been a little too angsty and cheesy for me. This movie did nothing to change my view.
","'You're wrong about us being on different paths, we're not on different paths. You're my path and you're always gonna be my path.' Peter (Garfield) is realizing that keeping his promise of staying away from Gwen (Stone) harder then he expected. Saving the city is still easy for him though. After Norman, the head of Oscorp dies and his son Harry is forced out villain after villain is created and Spider-man faces threats both physically and emotionally. I have to begin be saying that I have never been a big Spider-man fan. When it comes to comic book movies I like the darker ones like Batman and the newest X-Men series. To me Spider-man has always been a little too angsty and cheesy for me. This movie did nothing to change my view. This movie dealt more with the relationship between Gwen and Peter then Spider-man vs. bad guys. For some people that may be OK but I am also not a fan of teenage love- dramas. Jamie Foxx was good in this as usual but he also seemed wasted, like they just wanted a big name actor for a bad guy and he was put into a role beneath his talent. My biggest complaint was the main reason I wanted to see this was for Paul Giamatti. He is one of the best and most underrated actors around today. Not to spoil anything but he is in the movie for about 3 minutes total. Car chase in the beginning and a scene at the end that served no other purpose then to set up a third movie. All that said though I again am not a Spider-man fan. If you like him you will like this movie, if you don't then like me you probably won't. Overall, a cheesy comic book movie that was basically Gwen and Peter break up, Spider-man scene, they get back together, Spider-man scene, they break up, Spider-man scene...over and over. To me this was just long and hard to care about. I do think that fans will love this though. I give this a C+.",5,4,10,17 August 2014
Ex Machina," an OK movie that wasn't what I was expecting and definitely won't be for everyone.
","'He isn't your friend. You shouldn't trust him. You shouldn't trust anything he says.' Caleb (Gleeson) is selected to take part in an experiment involving advanced AI robots. The mind behind the idea, Nathan (Isaac) has made the robots as life like as he could. The longer Caleb stays, and the more he finds out, he isn't sure Nathan is doing a good thing like he said he is. This is a hard movie to review. I did like it OK, but it moved very slow and wasn't really what I expected. I wasn't looking for action, I was just hoping for something a little less predictable and more to the movie than Caleb talking to the robot. There are some pretty neat twists in this and I loved the ending but I had pretty high hopes for this one and it fell a little short of what I wanted. That in no way means this is a bad movie, just different. Overall, an OK movie that wasn't what I was expecting and definitely won't be for everyone. I give this a B-.",6,0,2,9 June 2015
Grudge Match," Funny and just a fun ride. A movie you can put in and just have fun with, that is what entertainment is all about.
","'Look at us, we're not dead. Everybody is laughing at us, the whole world is laughing at us but we're not dead. We're not dead, in fact this whole thing has made me feel more alive then ever.' 30 years ago the third and decisive fight between Henry 'Razor' Sharp (Stallone) and Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen (De Niro) was surprisingly canceled after Razor suddenly retired. The Kid has never gotten over it and the two still have bitter hatred toward each other. When Razor needs a way to make money he agrees to film himself for a video game. When Kid shows up early old wounds come up and the two go after each other. A promoter sees an opening and the third fight is finally scheduled. I watch so many movies whether I want to or not that it's hard to get super excited about watching most movies now. This is an exception. I was really looking forward to seeing this one. I thought the idea was OK but the casting was great. Finally the question will be answered who is a better fighter Rocky or Jake 'Raging Bull' La Motta? While I can't say this is a great movie or one I would watch over and over it was very fun and enjoyable to watch. There were a few in-jokes about those two movies which made it that much funnier. I do recommend this and even though I had high expectations going in I wasn't disappointed at all. Overall, funny and just a fun ride. A movie you can put in and just have fun with, that is what entertainment is all about. I give this a B+.",8,0,1,12 April 2014
Pawn Sacrifice," One of the surprise movies of the year that deserves a bigger audience than it will get. I really enjoyed this & recommend it
","'Bobby won't crack, he will explode.' Ever since he was a young boy Bobby Fischer (Maguire) has been obsessed with chess. His dream of becoming the youngest world champion ever has been crushed by the Russian's way of playing and he slowly starts to lose his mind. Wanting to prove to everyone, and himself that is is the best in the world he sets up a series of matches with Boris Spassky (Schreiber), the best player in the world. As the match draws closer Fischer begins to descend further into madness and it starts to affect his ability to play. I knew very little about the real story of Bobby Fischer before watching this so most of this was new to me. For a movie about chess I have to say the movie was actually pretty exciting to watch, and Maguire really surprised me with his acting. I'm not sure how historically accurate this is but watching it the tenseness was there and you really felt uncomfortable for and with Bobby. One of the surprise movies of the year that deserves a bigger audience than it will get. I really enjoyed this and recommend it. Overall, great acting and great drama. More movies like this should be made. I give it an A-.",8,46,53,23 December 2015
Magic Mike XXL," This had no real story. On the other hand I am a guy, not the target audience & the reason most women watch isn't for the plot
","'It's not bro time, it's show time. Are you guys ready?' It's been three year since Mike (Tatum) last danced. He runs a successful business and is looking to make a great life for himself. When he hears that the rest of the Kings of Tampa want to give up the life too they all decide there is only one way to retire. The boys head to Myrtle Beach for one last performance. First thing I have to say is that I am a man, so this review is done from my point of view. I thought the first movie wasn't as bad as I was expecting, but to me it was just cheesy and actually pretty much what I expected. I do remember there was enough comedy in it to keep me interested. This movie seemed to play on the women will watch the hell out of this so it doesn't matter what we do. As far as that thinking goes, it worked. My wife really liked it, but I'm not sure if she liked the movie or just liked watching the movie. This is a movie that is pretty much review proof, either you want to see a movie about male strippers or you don't. Not much else to say. Overall, not as good as the first one, mainly because this one had no real story. On the other hand I am a guy, not the target audience, and the only reason most women watch is not for the plot.

Hidden Figures," Very uplifting and inspiring and one that I do highly recommend. One the family can, and probably should all watch together
","'Look around. We are already living the impossible.' Katherine Johnson (Henson) is one of the smartest mathematicians in the world. She works as a computer for NASA at the height of the space race. Needing to answer back after Russia sent Sputnik into space the US is readying to send a man into space, but are struggling with finding a way to bring him home. It ultimately took a group of unlikely employees to accomplish the mission and show the world what America is capable of. This is a movie that I have heard nothing but good things about since it was released. When a movie is talked about as much as this and in such a positive light it is difficult for it to live up to the hype, usually. This one came close. I will admit this wasn't really what I expected though. I really expected this to focus more on the racial tensions that the women went though. While that did play a large part in this it seemed that that aspect was an afterthought. I'm not saying that's a bad thing though. The movie seemed to focus more on Johnson and the others proving themselves through her job to the point of being needed, regardless of gender or skin color. That is a lesson everyone needs to learn. As for the movie itself. It is very uplifting and inspiring and one that I do highly recommend. One the family can, and probably should all watch together. Overall, I can easily see why this was up for best picture and I do highly recommend this. I give this a high B+.",7,10,21,10 April 2017
Lincoln," The best picture & best performance I have seen in a movie so far this year. More then just history buffs will love this. I say A+
","'Can we choose to be born or are we fitted to the times we are born into?' The Civil War is coming to an end. President Abraham Lincoln (Lewis) is trying to get the 13th Amendment to the Constitution (abolishing slavery) passed before the end of the war. Not surprisingly he meets strong opposition. Before I start as most of you know I am a huge history buff and was really looking forward to seeing this so I had high expectations. I have to admit it did not let me down at all and may have actually been better then I was hoping for. Lewis was amazing in this (as usual) and this may be his best performance so far, which is saying a lot. Im my opinion Spielberg has yet to make a bad movie and the streak does not end with this one. Best movie of the year and best performance I have seen so far. I very highly recommend this movie. Not just history fans will like this but movie fans in general. Overall, a great movie that in my opinion is a must see not only for the subject but for Lewis's performance. I give it an A+.",10,4,14,20 November 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Nothing I say will change anyone's mind but I have to say I wasn't amazed by this like everyone else was.
","'I have lived most of my like surrounded by my enemies, I will be grateful to die among my friends.' Peter Quill (Pratt) is a space scavenger who has just found an artifact that is being sought by some very dangerous men. Immediately after taking it he is captured and is thrown together with an evil mercenary Gamora (Saldana), a brute bent on revenge, a fast talking raccoon, and a tree. When the true nature of the artifact is found out the group must find a way to work together to save a planet. First off I have to start by saying once again that I am not a big fan of comic book movies. I didn't see this in the theatre but the only thing I have heard since then is how great this was. Every single person that saw this told me how good it was. I head the 'best superhero movie ever' over and over so the expectations were a little higher than normal for this. I don't know if it was the expectations or that I am tired of comic book movies but I was disappointed in this and wasn't all that impressed. I thought the best part was the soundtrack and the raccoon. This is a movie that is almost critic proof since it seems that any super hero movie makes a billion dollars so really nothing I say will change anyone's mind but I have to say I wasn't amazed by this like everyone else was. Overall, I'm sure I am one of the only ones to say this but I didn't really like this. I give it a B-.",6,6,13,15 December 2014

","'You don't understand. There was something in the woods and I think it's in here with us now.' Looking to finally get their friend Mia (Levy) off of drugs for good a group of friends head out to a remote cabin in the woods for the weekend. A gross smell leads them to a room full of dead animals and a strange book. While investigating the book one of the friends unknowingly unleashes an unspeakable horror on all of them. It has been a long time (around 15 years) since I have seen the original trilogy. From what I remember the first two were OK but the third one, Army Of Darkness, is one of the funniest movies ever. There were a few call back scenes to the original in this and from what I remember this is a little better, but still really nothing but gore and blood. There is a few scary parts in this, but with all the gore and blood it distracts from the overall horror aspect I was going for. To me when you just slice up people that is not horror. Other then that though I do have to say that this is a rare remake that is just about as good as the original. Overall, horror fans will love this, I thought it was just too much gore for it to really be scary. I give it a B-.",6,1,11,7 July 2013

During WWII the Germans sent cryptic messages that were easily intercept-able but impossible to decode. England enlists their greatest code breakers to find a way to crack the codes. Alan Turing (Cumberbatch) comes up with a machine that will be able to break any code they can come up with, while at the same time hiding his secrets from the world. This is just a fantastic movie. I had pretty high expectations going in and it met or exceeded everyone of them. I have yet to see the Theory Of Everything but Cumberbatch did an amazing job in this that I am not sure how he didn't win best actor. This is a movie that will both inspire, move and infuriate you all at the same time. I could go on and on about this but I will say just watch it. Today.

While he is at a meeting he is told that the school will be stopping the music program that is headed by his friend Marty (Winkler). Wanting to save his friends job Scott begins to fight in MMA matches in order to raise the money to save the program. I have to admit that I was not looking forward to this one. I really like Kevin James but the movie looked to cheesy for me to get into. I was very wrong. While the movie was cheesy it was the good kind and it made you feel good watching it for the entire time. The best way to describe this is that it is a mix between Rocky and Mr. Holland's Opus. Two movies I never thought would be connected but it worked. This is one of the best family movies that has come out in a while and is one of the most surprisingly good movies that I have seen in a long time. I highly recommend this. Overall, a great movie that every member of the family will enjoy. I give it an A-.",8,1,2,4 February 2013
Jurassic World," A rare sequel that has a ton of hype behind it that isn't a total disappointment. I really enjoyed this.
","'A whole new frontier has opened up. We have our first genetically modified hybrid.' Twenty-two years after the Jurassic Park tragedy the bugs have been worked out and the park has finally opened. Things are going great until attendance begins to drop. Wanting to make things exciting again the geneticists have created a new type of dinosaur. Once again the lesson of 22 years ago is forgotten, man shouldn't tamper with nature. I have been a huge fan of this series since I saw the first one in theaters. They are movies that are exciting to watch over and over. This one is no exception. The story of this one is almost secondary to the action, but it works. The movie is tense and exciting the entire time. Nothing is more exciting than seeing dinosaurs interacting with people and it really makes me want to visit a park like thisas long as the events that take place are different. If I had to knock the movie for anything it would be the same problem I had with the Star Wars prequels and Maleficent. When you watch the original movies Darth Vader and Maleficent are evil and scary but the new ones humanize them and make you look at them in a different light, this takes away from the originals for me. The same thing occurs in this movie in regards to some dinosaurs. That however is a very minor complaint and isn't worth skipping this over. Overall, a rare sequel that has a ton of hype behind it that isn't a total disappointment. I really enjoyed this. I give this an A-.",8,1,6,29 June 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," If you liked 'Inception' you will love 'Adjustment Bureau'.Very exciting movie that will leave you wanting more I say A
","'All I have are the choices I make, and I choose her, come what may.' While on a bus politician David Norris (Damon) meets Elise Sellas (Blunt) and soon after the depart he thinks he has lost her forever. When she starts to show up at more and more of the places he is at he thinks he is the luckiest man alive. Until he meets the 'Bureau'. When told it will ruin both their lives if they continue to see each other Norris has a decision to make. While the movie reminded me a lot of 'Inception', it was also one of the more original movies that I have seen. There is quite a but of religious undertones, being that the movie is about how your life has a 'plan made by the Creator', but it is in no way a religious themed movie. Much like 'Inception' this is a dramatic/sci-fi/thriller, and it seems like this may be a new genre and type of movie that will continue to be made. I am OK with that. A great cast adds to the enjoyment of the movie and this is one that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Overall I would say if you liked 'Inception' you will love this one. This movie is also much, much easier to understand then 'Inception' was, and almost as good. Great, great movie. I say A.Would I watch again? - I absolutely will. I want to buy this.*Also try - Inception & Speed Of Thought",9,1,2,17 June 2011
The Hangover Part II," The first one was great, very funny and pretty original. This one wasn't, more of a remake then sequel. But not funny. I say B-
","'It happened again, we lost Teddy' Stu (Helms) is getting married...again. Phil (Cooper), Doug and Alan are at the bachelor party...again. They drink too much and wake up in a strange hotel room with a lost friend...again. They try to find clues to where their friend is and things keep getting worse and worse...again. If you liked the first one I would be weary of this one. It's pretty much the same movie with a little changes. A monkey instead of a tiger. An old guy instead of a baby. Bangkok instead of Vegas. A tattoo instead of losing a tooth. I think the main problem with this movie is that the first one came out of nowhere and surprised everyone with how funny it was. After making a ton of money a sequel had to be made. The only problem is that this type of movie doesn't lend itself to a sequel. So they did they only thing they could. I would call this more of a remake then a sequel, and much like all remakes it's not as good as the original. Overall, very disappointing after the classic first one. I give it a B-.*Also try - Cedar Rapids & Hangover Part 1",5,1,1,30 November 2011
Prisoners," One of the best movies of the year & one that sticks with you long after its over. I highly recommend this. I say A.
","'There's no way someone with the I.Q. of a 10 year old boy could abduct 2 girls in broad daylight and then somehow disappear.' While at Thanksgiving at their friends house Keller Dover's (Jackman) daughter asks if her and her friend can run home and get a whistle. When they never return Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is called in and the search for the girls begins. When Keller thinks the police aren't doing enough he takes matters into his own hands and won't stop until his daughter is found. Based on the cast alone I was excited about seeing this. There are some movies you watch and laugh all the way through and come out feeling happy. There are some movies you watch all the time to relax you and have fun with. This is not one of those movies. While this is one of the best movies of the year and I honestly think Oscar nominations are not a long shot this movie leaves you feeling tense and uneasy the entire time. The fact that there is very little music helps create the tension it is going for. While this is a great movie and a must see this isn't one you can watch over and over due to the emotion and the way it makes you feel, especially if you are a parent. I highly recommend this but do not expect anything light and fun. Overall, one of the best movies of the year and one that sticks with you long after its over. I give it an A.",9,1,2,3 October 2013
Silence," This is Scorsese's new Kundun. There are people who will enjoy this, but this is defiantly not a movie for everyone.
","'We will not abandon our hidden Christians who live in fear.' Rodrigues (Garfield) is a Jesuit priest who, along with his fellow priest has just received word that their mentor Ferreira (Neeson) has traveled to Japan and committed apostasy. The two travel to the country to not only find their friend but also to support and spread Catholicism. What they find is torture and abuse and a land that will test their faith in ways they could have never imagined. When I saw this movie was coming to Blu-Ray my first thought was, how did a Scorsese movie come and go without me hearing about it? After watching it I can see why. I'm not saying this is a bad movie at all but its just agonizingly slow in many parts and just a little too long. Length of a movie doesn't usually bother me because my two favorite movies are The Godfather (almost 3 hours) and JFK (directors cut is over 4) but this one felt longer than the 2 hours and 40 minute run time. The story is very good, the acting is great and the movie is beautiful and very well made, but it was one I really struggled to get into. This is Scorsese's new Kundun. There are people who will enjoy this, but this is defiantly not a movie for everyone. Overall, great acting, directing and story but one that I really struggled to get into.

Logan," Not as good as the Dark Knight, but like that movie this one can appeal to more than just the core comic book audience.
","'The world is not the same as it was.' In the future mutants are scarce and Logan (Jackman) is trying to hide from the world while caring for an ailing Professor X (Stewart). When someone finds him and asks for help he does his best to ignore them, but then he sees something that changes everything. Now Logan, Charles, and a girl are trying to find their way to Eden and finally find a peaceful life. This is one of the best comic book movies I have seen. The fact that this is R rated really helped the movie. The brutality and in-tenseness of the violence really helps you get fully invested in the film. My big hit against the Marvel/Avenger movies is that there is never any real drama and they are all cookie cutter and repetitive. The new X-Men series has continued the standard started by the Nolan Batman saga in that it is possible to make a comic book movie when the characters have real depth and emotion and a gripping adult story line. This movie contains all of that and more. You almost forget this is a superhero movie, and that is a good thing. The movie is brutal and very bloody, but again it really adds to the feel and the movie needs to show that Logan has changed. The previous stand alone Wolverine movies have not been good at all, but this one more than makes up for them. This is a movie I highly recommend whether you are a comic book movie fan or not. Overall, not as good as the Dark Knight, but like that movie this one can appeal to more than just the core comic book audience. I give this an A-.",8,3,7,22 May 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," I will be in the minority of this one but without any type of suspense I wonder how much longer can they keep me interested?
","'Peace in our time, imagine that.' After finally taking control of Loki's staff, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) begins to run tests on it in hopes of being able to harness it's energy for his personal use. The good news is is that his idea worked. The bad news is is that he accidentally created Ultron (Spader) who wants to save the world by destroying it. Now, with the help of the rest of the Avengers they most stop Ultron from creating total destruction, but in-fighting within the group starts to derail the mission. Once again I will start by saying that I am not a huge fan of this whole Marvel Universe series. One reason is that I was never a huge comic book fan, the other (and main reason) is that because of all the planned movies we have been told about there is no suspense watching these. Other series like X-Men and (depending on how you view it) Batman have killed off major characters. Once one of the major characters dies it gives you a sense of, holy crap what's going to happen now. I'm not saying the movie would be better if Iron Man gets hit with something and dies. I am saying that knowing that in the next few years there will be another Captain America movie (Iron man will be in this one), a new Thor, 2 more Avengers as well as many many more featuring smaller characters in this movie takes away any suspense the movie tries for. The characters in this movie start to fight with each other, but knowing that next year they will all work together again makes that scene seem pointless. These movies are all review proof so nothing I say will change you mind about watching it or not, but I think the total saturation of this genre is starting to get to me and I am fast losing interest in these movies. I will be in the minority of this one but to me this was boring and without any type of suspense I was wondering how much longer can these story lines keep me interested? Overall, another Avengers movie...is there anything else to say? I give this a B-.",6,3,9,1 October 2015
Everest," The movie is exciting, gripping and emotional. This is more than a movie, its an experience.
","'Human beings aren't built to function at the cruising rate of a 747.' Rob Hall (Clarke) is one of the world's best guides of Everest. People pay him a lot of money to guide them to the top, and he has succeeded over and over again. What most people don't realize is that making it to the top is only half the battle. This is the true story of the expedition of 1996. This is INTENSE. For anyone wondering how a movie about a group of people climbing can be exciting just watch this and answer it yourself. The movie is exciting, gripping and emotional. The effects are perfect and really add to the experience. You can't help but become connected to every hiker, and there are a lot of them.

Friends with Benefits," A funny 're-make' of No Strings Attached that I didn't think was as good. I do like Portman better though. I say B
","'Are you asking me out? I mean, I'm the only friend you have in New York - you don't wanna complicate that.' When Dylan (Timberlake) is lured to New York for a job by Jamie (Kunis) they become friends. After a night of romantic comedy watching they begin to talk about how 'broken' they are. After a deal is worked out they become 'Friends With Benefits', but, predictably, that only makes things worse. The plot to this is almost the same as 'No Strings Attached'. After having seen that one, I didn't think this one was as good. Most of it probably has to do with the fact that I think Portman is hotter then Kunis though. Also No Strings felt less girlie to me, and I can't explain why. While Timberlake was pretty funny, and Woody Harrelson had some funny lines (but did tend to go over the top) the movie really seemed to drag for me. I did like the fact that the movie tried to make fun of all other romantic comedies (from dialog, to settings, to music) but I still got bored in parts. I think that, like me, when compared to 'No Strings Attached' you will pick a favorite based on the main actors. That is because it basically the same movie. Much like 'Deep Impact' & 'Armageddon'. Overall, a funny movie that is not as good as the 'original'. I give it a B.*Also try - No Strings Attached",Null,1,2,24 October 2011
Elysium," This had action, drama, suspense & something that a lot of movies are lacking, emotion & heart. I highly recommend. I say A
","'You will do something very important one day. Something you were born for.' In the year 2154 the class system of Earth got out of control. Now the super rich live on a 'floating planet' called Elysium where poverty, crime and disease are non-existent. Max (Damon) has a dream of one day going there but he is stuck working in a factory making robots. When he becomes exposed to a high level of radiation he has 5 days to live, unless he can find a way to Elysium. He will do anything for that chance. I was excited about seeing this but also a little hesitant because I didn't really like District 9. While you could tell this was the same director, it did have the same feel and look, I liked this one much much more. This had action, drama, suspense and something that a lot of movies are lacking these days, emotion and heart. This isn't simply just a race to save a life, it becomes so much more and the story is what keeps you watching not just the effects. I had pretty high expectations for this going in and I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this. I give it an A.",9,0,3,14 September 2013
Frank," Really nothing more than a generic music movie that has been done a million times...but this one has a singer with a giant fake head.
","'I will show them what I'm capable of. I will show them.' Jon Burroughs (Gleeson) is a struggling wanna be musician who is drifting aimlessly through life. When he happens on a band that needs a keyboardist he gladly fills in. He is surprised when he sees Frank (Fassbender) the lead singer who always wears a fake head. Little by little Jon starts to become more assertive with the music but this causes strain with the band and the eccentric Frank. I have been writing these little reviews for about 3 years now. I average about 7-8 a week and most of the time they come easy to me. Rarely am I at a loss as to what to say. This is one of those times. There are some movies that are good, some that are bad and some that are just so bizarre you aren't sure what to think. The last few that I saw that come to mind are Rubber (the movie about the killer tire) and Congress (the new Robin Wright movie). This is really nothing more than just a generic music movie that has been done a million times...but this one has a singer with a giant fake head. It is not something anyone dwells on and is really just accepted that that is how he is. Overall, I did like this OK but this is not a movie for everyone. I give it a B-.",6,0,3,5 November 2014
Selma," One of the better movies of the year, but it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. Oyelowo did a good job but he lacked passion
","'Our lives are not fully lived if we're not willing to die for those we love, for what we believe.' Even though the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been passed, African Americans are still struggling for voting equality. President Johnson isn't willing to help Martin Luther King Jr. (Oyelowo) in this movement until after the election cycle. When a group of African American's decide to March from Selma to Montgomery Alabama in order to raise awareness they are attacked and beaten. Left with no other option Martin Luther King decides to join in the next march while President Johnson and Governor Wallace are stuck in the middle of the ethical debate. Before I watched this movie all I heard about was how it was snubbed by the Oscars for Actor and Director. 'How can a movie only be up for best picture and nothing else?' I went in with that mindset. After watching this I have to say I agree with the nomination. The movie is very good and very much worth seeing. The pacing of the movie was very jerky though. Just when the movie becomes tense it begins to slow down and loses the momentum it had going for it. Oyelowo did a really good job playing Dr. King, but he seemed to lack passion in the speeches and it felt like he was trying to just re-create what he watched the real Dr. King do. On the other hand though, when you are playing someone that iconic you are more or less not trying to screw it up and the tenseness of playing Dr. King really showed. All of that said though the movie is very good and I do recommend it. Overall, this is one of the better movies of the year, but it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. Much like The Butler it is not deserving of multiple awards even though the subject matter is important. I disappointingly give this a B.",7,1,2,20 February 2015
The Artist," A little better then I expected but I still don't think it deserved best picture. Worth a watch if you are in the mood. I say B
","'I won't talk. I won't say a word.' Silent movie star George Valentin (Dujardin) is the biggest star in Hollywood. While out getting his picture taken and talking to reporters he bumps into a young woman named Peppy Miller (Bejo). After seeing her picture in the paper she decided to audition for a role in a movie. She is an instant hit and her and George hit it off. When George's producer Al Zimmer (Goodman)tells him that the future is in 'talkies' he laughs it off. He is stunned when it takes off, with Peppy as the star. I have seen all of the best picture nominees of the year and saved this one for last. I was very skeptical going in, how good can a black & white/silent movie really be in 2012? I will have to admit that the movie was better then I expected it to be, but I still think that this is one of the most overrated movies I have seen recently. If you have seen 'Sunset Boulavard' then you have seen a much better version of this movie. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie and my problem with it wasn't that it was silent or black & white (I have no problem with those types of movies) but it was very boring in some parts and had trouble staying focused. This movie could have been worse but I really don't think that this was deserving of best picture at all. Best actor I can see, but not picture. This is a movie to watch out of curiosity but don't expect the best movie of the year. Overall, the most overrated movie to win best picture since 'Slumdog Millionaire'. I give it a B.**For those curious : I have seen all 9 best picture nominees and 'Moneyball' was my favorite, but I think that 'Descendants' should have won.",Null,0,1,20 May 2012

","'City of stars are you shining just for me?' Mia (Stone) is an aspiring and struggling actress who spends her time in between auditions working as a barista. When she walks into a restaurant and hears Sebastian (Gosling) playing piano the lives of both become entwined. Now, both are struggling to make their dreams come true while at the same time supporting each other, but somethings don't go as smooth as you hope. This is a movie that had everything going against it for me. I was not in the mood to watch it, I usually don't like movies that have this much hype behind it and I was expecting wall to wall singing and dancing and sat down expecting to be bored and uninterested. I'm not sure if it was those expectations or not but I ended up liking this much more than I expected to. In case you're scared, the movie is not wall to wall singing at all and is like Chicago in the way that the musical numbers are large and full out, but placed sporadically and in ways that actually make sense (after the opening). This is not a movie that will convert non-musical fans into theater lovers, but at the same time it won't offend those that hate them either. This is a movie where I can see why it won the awards and Emma Stone did do a tremendous job in this very intense part. Overall, much better than I was expecting, I went in expecting to be bored and hate it and ended up actually liking and and that is a sign of how good this movie actually is. I surprisingly give this a B+.",8,3,7,1 May 2017
Mama," Creepy but not really scary. At once depressing and creepy which really makes the movie that much better as it toys with you. I say B.
","'In order to survive such extreme isolation the girls created an imaginary guardian, a parent figure to feed them, sing to them, protect them. They called her mama.' After the stock market takes a down turn the father of two young girls panics and begins to drive off with them. After an accident leads them to a cabin he is about to do the unthinkable when something grabs him. Five years later the girls living with their uncle and aunt begin to see their 'mama' again. I will start by saying that this movie is creepy but not full on scary. Anyone who has seen the other Del Torro movies will recognize his style. This movie is scary in the way that Pan's Labrynth was. I do have to say that the movie was also a little depressing which made the creepy parts that much more effective since it's playing with your emotions. The movie is good and worth watching but it is PG-13 so don't expect a jump out of your seat horror. Overall, good movie worth seeing but also a little depressing as well as creepy. I give it a B.",6,0,1,5 April 2013
Super 8," A very good sci/fi thriller that fans of Cloverfield will love. Could have been a little shorter and been better though. I say B+
","'Do not speak of this or else you and your parents will die.' When a group of kids set out to film a scene for a movie they want to submit to a contest they witness a train crash. When the man that caused it gives them a warning and people start disappearing they begin to investigate further. This is a difficult movie to review. Much like 'Cloverfield' the preview gives nothing away, and I don't want to ruin anything or give too much away. I will say though that you can really tell that this is a JJ Abrams movie, and Spielberg's ideas are all over this as well. I would have to say that this is a pretty good mix of 'Cloverfield' and 'Stand By Me' with a steadier camera and more tense. The biggest problem with this movie to me is that it was too slow in some parts. Trying to put too much in the movie it takes a lot of repetition and long drawn out exposition scenes which hurt the flow of the movie to me. If they simplified it just a little or had more faith in the viewer it would have been much better then it was. On the other hand this was much much better then I was expecting. Overall, a tense and entertaining thriller that is definitely worth a watch. It was just a few tweaks from being a classic. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.*Also try - Cloverfield & Skyline",Null,1,2,6 October 2011
Sinister," Scary in parts but I expected scarier. This is more of a psychological then Saw like horror. Comparable to the Shining. I say B-
","'Do you understand what you've done this time? The kind of jeopardy you've put your children in? Your marriage?' Ellison Oswalt (Hawke) is a true crime author doing research for his next book. Wanting to be as accurate as possible he moves him and his family into a house where the crime took place. He finds 'snuff' films in the house and begins to watch them when he notices a strange figure in each of them. The more he sees the more terror his family goes through. I will start be letting you know what kind of movies scare me. To me Poltergeist is the scariest movie but I also watched it when I was like 8. Recently the Exorcism of Emily Rose and Insidious really scared me. I say that to tell you that this movie didn't really scare me like I expected. The movie is more psychological then horror but it does have some definite scary parts to it. I'm not sure what I was expecting but I was thinking it was going to be scarier then it was. I would compare the horror in this to the Shining more then any other movie. Overall, not bad but I expected something different, more scary. I did like the ending though.

Snowden," Oliver Stone has done it again. A thought provoking and debate starting movie. Go in with an open mind. I loved this.
","'I no longer have to worry about what happens tomorrow because I'm happy with what I've done today' Edward Snowden (Gordon-Levitt) wants to serve his country in anyway he can after the military doesn't work out. What starts off as a dream job with the CIA changes into something he can't reconcile with himself. He moves from career to career but nothing changes, until he decides to tell the public what he knows. This is a movie that will elicit many emotions from people and a massive political debate can be the result of watching this. I will take that out of the review since this is a movie and not a documentary. Oliver Stone has been my favorite director for a while and he proves it again here. The movies he makes are not just movies they are statements. This is no different. I'm not sure how much is realistic and how much is added but I will say that the movie deals with his emotions and the reasons he did what he did. If you go into this movie with an open mind you will get the desired experience. If you go on with your stance firmly on either side you will find things that will enhance your opinion. That's the beauty of Oliver Stone. Overall, Joseph Gorden-Levitt says it best when he said, 'its not just your average drama. It's an Oliver Stone movie.' I give this an A.",9,3,7,26 December 2016

Maria Altmann, (Mirren) has just lost her sister and after looking through her things she finds a letter that tells her the famous painting in Austria called the Woman in Gold has been left to her. She hires lawyer Randol (Reynolds) to help her get it back. What should be an easy thing becomes more and more difficult as Maria and Randol take on the Supreme Court and the entire country of Austria in the quest to return what Maria believes is rightfully hers. I wasn't that excited to watch this one, but that is because I don't usually watch previews before I see the movie. All that said this is one of the best movies I have seen in awhile. I love court room dramas, and while this isn't a straight court room movie, it had enough of that aspect to keep me intrigued. This is also a true story which I also love. Mirren and Reynolds play off each other great and the chemistry really helps the movie. I know nothing about this actual case so the entire movie left me wanting to know more. This is a movie that words can't do justice to. All I have to say is watch this, you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend this. Overall, simply just a great movie that I can't say enough about.

Love & Mercy," Not just one of the better bio-pics of the last few years, this is one of the better movies as well.
","'I've got different stuff inside me and I've got to get it out.' Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys are a international phenomenon. Popular with critics and audiences alike they have everything they ever wanted. When Brian (Dano) begins to try and branch out to a different sound he is met with resistance and slowly descends into madness. Now as an adult Brian (Cusack) has found a new love, but once again meets resistance, this time in trying to cure his mental state. I was looking forward to watching this for awhile. I love music and my favorite type of movie are true stories. I like the Beach Boys but am not a huge fan. That said, this made me want to listen to more of their music, this time with the background of what occurred. Paul Dano does a great job and Cusack is the perfect choice as well. I do think that Paul Giamatti is the one that steals this movie and he is excellent in this as always. The movie itself is very interesting and entertaining. It is set up like the Godfather 2. Two people play the same person, one on the way down and one on the way up. The juxtaposition of the two stories works great in this and even though I was excited about this movie it was still better than I expected. Overall, not just one of the better bio-pics of the last few years, this is one of the better movies as well. I give this an A.",9,1,2,14 September 2015

After struggling author Eddie (Cooper) meets an old friend who has an experimental drug that Eddie tries his life is changed. After the pill lets him access and use 100% of his brain power he becomes a new man, but is the pill safe? I really enjoyed this movie, but couldn't help but thinking that this almost a pro-drug movie. Bradley Cooper is the perfect choice for this role, and De Niro is once again in a legitimate role (after Little Fockers & Machete). The thriller aspect of this movie is very well done and you are actually on the edge of your seat through out most of the movie. Unlike many movies today that have a sci-fi feel to them, this one seems pretty believable, and makes me wonder if a pill like this exists, or will exist. This movie shows both the pros and cons of the drug, but overall feels like it is much more pro then con. That is probably the intention, but for better or worse it is what it is. I really enjoyed this and this is a great choice for a night in. Overall, a very exciting thriller with great acting. This is the type of movie that you like when you are done watching it, but the more you think and talk about it the more you like it. That is the sign of a good movie.

","'It's kind of messed up to rob a blind guy, isn't it?' Rocky (Levy) and her friends want to get out of Detroit and are willing to do anything they can to make this happen. After robbing houses for very little money they decide to go for broke. Their mark is an old veteran (Lange)who has $300,000 in his house. When they find out he is blind they think it will be easy, but this is no ordinary blind man. This is a movie that could have gone two ways. Super cheesy and cliché, or tense and original. For me, this was the latter. This is not a typical horror movie in the way that it is not full of random jump scares or possessions. This is also, thankfully, not a 'found- footage' or Saw type horror where it relies on gore to scare you. This is movie a more tense Purge-like movie. 4 people are trapped inside a house where being the last one standing is the only way out. This movie does add more and more suspense and, surprises to keep it feeling fresh. The best part of this movie though it that, unlike most recent horror, there is an actual story and character development. That aspect makes you question and wonder who you should root for. That extra layer really makes this movie work and is one of the better horror movies I have seen in the last few years. Overall, a horror movie with a story and characters you actually care about.

The more she discovers about how the task force is operating the more leery she is about it. When she thinks they are taking things too far she worries for her own safety. This is first off a great movie. I remember when Traffic came out I was very excited to watch it, and when I finally did I was a little disappointed. I did not have this feeling with this one at all. This movie is tense, exciting, infuriating and depressing all at once. the acting is great, the events seem real, which makes it depressing and infuriating.

He shows up and is asked by the defense attorney Helen (Pike) to help her investigate the shooter he knows so well. After Reacher begins to dig what he finds makes him think the shooter is innocent. The problem is no one else does, and some want to get Reacher out of the way. I'm not sure what I really expected to see when I sat down to watch this, but I got something much much better. I think I expected another generic action movie, this is more of a mystery type of detective movie. That said, it is also a fantastic movie that keeps you guessing the whole time. I loved almost everything about this, the only complaint I had really is Tom Cruise. To me he really just didn't fit the part, but other then that this is a great movie that is very much worth seeing. You really aren't sure who to trust and who is pulling the strings. That makes the movie that much more fun to watch. Even for someone who isn't a Tom Cruise fan this is very fun to watch and his best movie in awhile. I highly recommend this.

When he sees one of the students running he decides it's time for the school to have a cross country team. Fighting with the runners, parents and school he does his best to transform the students, the school and the community. In terms of movies there is really one sure bet. If you put Kevin Costner in a sports movie it's gonna be good. Even with those high expectations this did not disappoint. The movie is tremendously inspiring. While watching there is a way you want it to end, and you are right there training and running with them hoping for the outcome you desire. The only bad I can say about it is that I liked his other ones better, but only because I like football and baseball more than running. That in no way diminishes the greatness of this movie though.

Next in line for the throne Thor (Hemsworth) thinks he can do no wrong. After he leads an unsuccessful raid his father is not happy. Thor is cast out from his world and lands in present day and meets Jane (Portman). Together they must find a way to get him home.

Next to 'X-Men : First Class' this is the best comic book movie of the summer, as well as one of the most exciting movies of the year. Even the little roles are memorable and add to the story. Anthony Hopkins and Renee Russo playing the mother and father give this movie credibility to being more then another super-hero movie. If you are a fan of comic book movies you will love this.

Little by little the crops begin to fail and the family is tested. Eventually the truth is revealed. This is a hard movie to review. This is defiantly a horror but I found the movie to just be disturbing and not that scary. There are scenes in this that just left me wincing and feeling like this isn't something I should be watching rather than scared. This is nothing all that in your face and not gory or anything like that, and it's not the subject matter that got to me.

Tommy Devito (Piazza) is putting a band together and trying to make it big. Nothing really clicks until Frankie (Young) joins the group. His distinct singing gives the group a push but when songwriter Bob Gaudio shows up the group explodes. Things are turning out the way they all wanted until Tommy's demons catch up with all of them. This is the true story of the rise and fall of the Four Seasons. First thing I have to say about this movie is that I was a little disappointed. I am not a big Frankie Valli fan but I do love true stories and music. The big problem with this to me was the pacing. The first hour seems like back story and they struggle to get a record deal. Then 20 minutes of hit after hit come at you, then another hour of the group falling apart. I was mainly looking forward to the music and that part seemed to be glossed over. All that said though the actors were perfect. Every person in here (except Devito and Christopher Walken) has been in the stage production on and off Broadway and that really added to the movie. You really believe they are the real people and the movie does come off almost like a stage play. The biggest problem again though is that is seemed to drag on and I was losing interest a few times.

","'This is what defeat looks like bro. Your jihad is over.' On September 11, 2001 the United States was attacked by a group of terrorists taking orders from Osama Bin Laden. Following that attack the intelligence agency of the US began a man hunt for him to bring him to justice. Ten years later with the help of Seal Team 6 he was taken down. This is the story of the man hunt. I love movies that are based on real events but they are sometimes hit or miss. The hardest part for a movie like this where the events have just happened is to keep it interesting and keep you watching even though you know the end. This movie succeeded beyond all hope. Much like Apollo 13 when the climax happens you are on the edge of your seat and wanting to see what happens even though you know the outcome. That is what makes this movie great. Also Bigelow has almost a Spielberg like quality to take hardcore war movies like this and Hurt Locker and transform them into movies that rely on great actors and not just the action. As great and exciting as this movie was Jessica Chastain was incredible in this and she is one of the reasons you get so involved with the story. This is another movie I could go on and on about but this is a definite must see and one of the best movies of the year. Overall, tense and gripping.

Steve Jobs," This is not a bio-pic in the traditional sense. The acting is great, but the Kutcher movie was much better in my opinion.
","'How come 10 times a day I read Steve Jobs is a genius? What do you do?' Steve Jobs (Fassbender) has a brilliant technological mind. He wants to put a computer in every home and every school and make it easy for everyone to use. From the introduction of the Mac in 1984 to the iMAC in 1998 he was at the forefront of every great technological advancement, and failure. As great of a computer man as he was he seemed to fail at every other aspect of his life. I know Steve Jobs was a genius, but I wondered why there needed to be two movies about him made. The Ashton Kutcher one did a great job of chronicling his life, making it interesting and finding out what made him how he was. This one does not do any of that. The movie follows Steve at three different product launches. The movie goes back and forth between showing what a horrible father he was, and what a horrible 'friend' he was. This is not a bio-pic in the traditional sense. The acting is great, but I all I got from this movie is that he was a very egotistical and stubborn man who never found good in others. I'm not sure if that is true or not, but if it is there certainly shouldn't have been a movie made about him, let alone two. Overall, good acting but the Kutcher movie was much better in my opinion.

One night he meets two men who offer to take him out for a drink and talk about business. When he wakes up the next morning he finds himself chained to the floor. Before he realizes what is happening to him he is shipped to the south and sold into slavery. When his new owner Edwin Epps (Fassbender) starts to break him down Solomon does everything he can to stay strong and fight for his survival and hope for freedom again. I'll start by saying before I watched this movie all I heard was that it should win Best Picture at the Oscars. So I was looking forward to watching this even though I expected it to be brutal and hard to watch in some parts. About halfway through I was left wondering what all the hype was about. The movie, to me at least, seemed very slow and boring. To me this a perfect example of a movie that makes you feel guilty for not liking it. The movie deals with a very important and serious part of history but the movie was really nothing more then look how bad slavery was, over and over. On one hand watching what Solomon goes through is gut wrenching and knowing its a true story makes it that much more powerful. On the other hand when the movie is over and you find out about the rest of his life I couldn't help but thinking if they would have done those events it would have been a better movie. This is not a terrible movie but I thought it was very overrated. Overall, one of the most important movies of the year in terms of subject, but that is different from being the Best Picture of the year. I give it a B.",6,2,5,10 March 2014
Sausage Party," An R-rated adult version of Toy Story that is really an indictment on hard core religious followers. I absolutely loved it.
","'Everything we've been led to believe is a lie.' Frank (Rogen) and the rest of the food in the supermarket dream of one day being chosen and taken away. They dream of a utopia and think its the best thing that can happen. After a jar of honey mustard comes back from the outside the things he says challenges everything they know. Now Frank, Branda (Wiig) and the rest of the food must look for the real answer before its too late. This is a movie that is not for everyone, at all. If you get offended, by anything, then do not watch this. That being said I thought this was hilarious and I was laughing a lot through out at not just the jokes but the actions. That being said this is really my kind of humor. Little offensive, cheap puns, and stupid with glimpses of genius ideas. On one hand this is an R-rated adult version of Toy Story, and on the other, more serious side, this is really an indictment on hard core religious followers. When combined the movie is extremely over the top and super offensive but cracked me up and I really enjoyed this. Overall, a movie full of cheap jokes and stupid humor that I cracked up at. If you even think you may be offended don't watch...it goes out of its way to make people uncomfortable. Which adds to the humor. I give this a B+.",8,3,6,5 November 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," I have to say that like everyone else I really enjoyed it. The movie is fast moving, entertaining and fun to watch.
","'What I'm gonna tell you sounds crazy but it's true. You have to listen to me, you're lives depend on it.' Cage (Cruise) is a major in the US Army when the planet falls under attack by aliens. After a disagreement with his superior he finds himself bumped down to private and thrown on the front lines. He is killed in battle but somehow wakes up at the beginning of the previous day. The same thing happens again and again. The only person who believes him is a soldier named Rita (Blunt). Together they have to find a way to kill the threat and break the cycle. I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan but I have liked most of his movies. I wasn't that excited about seeing this but everyone I talked to that had seen it said it was great. I still had tempered expectations for it when I sat down to view it. I have to say that like everyone else I really enjoyed it. The movie is fast moving, entertaining and fun to watch. The movie does make you think and you have to pay attention to catch everything that is going on. To me that is what makes a movie fun to watch, one that keeps you involved. The movie is pretty much a sci-fi version of Groundhog Day like everyone says but there is more to it than that. If I had to pick one fault with it it would have to be the end. It is a mix of being way too Hollywood and one that doesn't totally make sense. When you watch this you will see what I mean. Overall, a very fun movie that more than just sci-fi fans will enjoy. I recommend this. I give it a high B+.",8,0,2,5 October 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," Higgins and Banks are again amazing as the announcers. Not as good as the original, but not a significant drop off either.
","'Let's get out there and ac the world' The Bellas, led by Becca (Kendrick) are on top of the acapella world. Having won three national championships in a row they are invited to sing for the President. After Fat Amy (Wilson) does something that embarrasses them, they are not only kicked off their tour, but also in danger of being forced to disband. Their only hope to remain a group is to win a world championship. I have to say that like most everyone the first movie took me by surprise. The movie seemed to come out of nowhere and combine hilarious comedy with a movie that is flat out fun to watch. That reasoning both helped and hurt this movie. The sequel could not sneak up on anyone and the expectations were higher for this one, for me anyway. That said I have to say that even though this wasn't as good as the first one this one was still very very funny and another really fun movie to watch. Higgins and Banks are amazing as the announcers and the movie is almost worth watching just for them. Since this is a sequel there isn't a whole lot to say to convince you to watch or not watch but I will say that if you haven't seen the first one I would check it out before this one. You may be surprised like I was. These movies are very funny and knowing that a lot of it is improved makes it that much funnier. Overall, not as good as the original, but not a significant drop off either. I recommend this. I give it a B+.",8,7,11,21 September 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," This is a real must see. There is drama, comedy, action, everything that makes a movie great. I can't say enough about it.
","'The are going to need a wrecking ball to get me out of here. This is my house!' Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio) is a stock broker at one of Wall Streets biggest firms. When the crash of '87 hit his firm went under and he lost his job. Desperate, he takes a job selling penny stocks, after finding out the commission he can make on these stocks he goes into business for himself. When he turns to duping rich people into buying these stocks him and his partner Donnie Azoff (Hill) become rich beyond their wildest dreams, but everything comes with a price. I am a huge Scorsese fan and am becoming a big DiCaprio one as well so I was really looking forward to seeing this. While the movie is 3 hours long it doesn't feel slow or drawn out and never actually felt like a 3 hour movie. If that is your reason to hesitate on it don't worry. While there is a ton of drug use and nudity in this it doesn't distract from the flow. All that said this is a real must see. There is drama, comedy, action, everything that makes a movie great. I can't say enough about this movie. The fact that this is based on a true story makes it even better. Do yourself a favor and watch this, you won't be sorry. Overall, a great experience and one that I will watch over and over. I give it an A+.",10,3,13,4 January 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," Not a bad movie, but will do nothing to make non Coen fans into one. If you love them you will love this movie, if not you won't
","'It's a swell story.' Eddie Mannix (Brolin) works for a huge Hollywood studio in the 50's and deals with all of the problems that comes up and fixes them. This day he has to deal with a unhappy director, covering up the pregnancy of a popular star and the disappearance of their lead actor in their biggest picture. Eddie jumps from fixing problem to problem while trying to decide on his own future. This is a movie that is almost review proof. The Coen brothers, for as big as they are and as famous as their movies are, are very polarizing. People either love everything they do, or avoid them. For me they are pretty hit or miss. They have done some movies I have really liked like Fargo, Big Lebowski and O, Brother Where Art Thou...but they also did Burn After Reading which I didn't like at all. This one, while it was funny and I did laugh a few times was more like Burn After Reading than the others. The dialog is witty and fast paced, but the actual plot itself seemed to really drag and I found myself wondering how much longer it will go on. Overall, this is not a bad movie at all, but will do nothing to make non Coen fans into one. If you love them you will love this movie, if not you won't. I give this a B-.",6,0,1,6 June 2016
Dark Shadows," If you have seen one Burton/Depp movie you have seen them all. Nothing different here at all. Edward Scisorhands 10. I say B-
","'Welcome back to the shadows Barnabas Collins, I've missed you.' After refusing the advances of Angelique Bouchard (Green), Barnabas Collins (Depp) is cursed with eternal life by being turned a vampire and being buried alive. 200 years later he is accidentally awoken and returns to the manor his family built where he meets his descendants. He soon discovers that his relatives do not have perfect lives either and begins to try and change the fortunes of the Collins family. I have to put a disclaimer on this review by saying that I am not a Johnny Depp fan and am really getting sick of him playing the same role over and over. Having said that this movie is deceiving. The preview made it seem like it was a comedy, while there are funny parts this is not really a straight comedy. I never saw the TV show so I wasn't sure what to expect but to me the movie had the feel of less funny 'Death Becomes Her' as far as comedy goes. To me the best parts were the old maid who doesn't speak at all and the soundtrack (as well as Alice Cooper). There were some pretty funny lines and Depp did do a good job but this is his typical character lately so I can't really be impressed by his acting. I will admit though that if you are a Johnny Depp fan then you will probably really enjoy this movie and totally disagree with my review. As far as my feelings I thought it was a little slow moving and seemed confused as to whether it wanted to be funny or not. Overall, fans of Depp will probably love this, I thought it was a little less then OK and a carbon copy of every other Depp/Burton movie. I give it a B-.",6,0,0,19 September 2012
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Fans of this series will watch it regardless, those that aren't won't. My son loved it, I thought it was OK.
","'This was the last move in a master plan. A plan long in the making.' After the dragon comes down from the mountain and is defeated the armies of darkness rise. Sides are chosen and armies are formed. Bilbo (Freeman) tries to settle things down, but its not as easy as he hoped it would be. This is a movie that is review proof. If you have seen and loved the other movies in this saga then you will watch this. If you have had no interest in any of them, this won't be the first one you start with. As for me, I have watched all of them, but never was really interested in them. My son loves them, and he was actually the one that was filling me in on what happened in the last few movies. The effects are great, and the 3D is amazing in this, but this is just not a genre or series I can get into. That said, my son loved it. Overall, fans of this series will watch it regardless, those that aren't won't. I give it a B.",6,0,1,23 March 2015
Arrival," Not only one of the the best movies of the year. Quite possible THE BEST movie of the year. Clear your schedule & watch this today.
","'There are days that define your story beyond your life.' Louise Banks (Adams) is a linguistics professor who just went through the worst thing a parent can experience. When word comes that aliens have landed she is the first person the army goes to for help. Now, against all odds Louise and Ian (Renner) must find a way to decipher their language and find out what the species wants before its too late. First of all I have to say this movie isn't really what I expected. That said, it was just wow! DO NOT go in expecting something like Independence Day, or any other alien movie you have ever seen before. Not only that, do not go in expecting to see something like any other movie in general. This movie breaks all the rules, and it works beyond belief. First off the movie is about deciphering language, and its extremely tense and interesting. Perhaps the biggest rule it breaks is that it shows you what is going to happen, and then you watch it happen. This movie pulls that off in a way I have never seen and keeps the tension and emotion throughout this process. This is a movie I could go on and on about but this is just a movie that needs to be seen and felt rather than read about. Overall, not only one of the the best movies of the year, this is quite possible THE BEST movie of the year. Clear your schedule and watch this today. I give this an A+.",10,0,6,14 February 2017
Rango," A cartoon version of the 'Man with no name' movies of Clint Eastwood. Not as good as those, not really for kids. I say C-
","'I can't survive in the desert, I don't belong here.' After falling out of his car and becoming lost on the side of the road, Rango (Depp) meets Bean (Fisher) and after a few careful lies becomes sheriff on the town. When all the town's water goes missing it is up to him to help find it and bring it back. Since this is a kids movie this will be a short review. I thought was very slow moving and a little boring. This does not really work as a kids cartoon. The opening scene will appeal to them, but the movie then becomes a full on western in the vane of 'The Man With No Name' movies starring Clint Eastwood. Very little action and a drawn out story line make this a little too adult for kids. My eight year old loved the first half-hour, then got really bored and went to play outside. My two year old who loves 'Toy Story' and pretty much and cartoon was very disinterested in this. I did finish it to see how it ended, but that's the only reason. Overall, not a very good kids movie, adults may like this more then kids, I did not. I give it a C-.Would I watch again? - No, I barely made it through once.*Also try - Nine",Null,1,1,17 July 2011
The Big Short," I highly recommend this & think everyone should see it, but make sure you're alone after because you'll be in a bad mood for hours
","'While the whole world was having a party a few outsiders and weirdos saw what no one else could.' In the mid 2000's Michael Burry (Bale) could see there was a housing market collapse coming. He decided to purchase a short, betting that the collapse would be massive. When word of this gets around more and more investors do the same thing. All betting that the US economy would tank. The bad news is they were right. They scary news is that this is a true story. This is a very good movie that is a little confusing to understand, for me anyway, but they did a good job of explaining it for non-wall streeters to understand. Just about everyone remembers this crisis and what happened and the fallout. What I didn't realize is how out of hand the mortgage loans became and why the collapse was so catastrophic. The more the movie went on and the more was explained the angrier and angrier I became, and by the end of it I was glad I didn't have anything to throw because I would have needed a new TV. This is the type of movie that is important and will hopefully change things, but judging by the way the actual crisis was handled I doubt it. Overall, a movie that I highly recommend and think everyone should see, but make sure you're alone after because you will be in a bad mood for hours. The actions of the banks was worse than I thought. Disgusting really. I give this an A.",9,0,0,14 March 2016
The Conjuring," Creepy & tense. If you liked Haunting In Connecticut you will love this one. A less scary Insidious type movie. I say B+
","'The devil exists. God exists. And for us, as people, our very destiny hinges on which we decide to follow.' When the Perron family moves into a new house they begin to notice strange events and images happening. When the kids refuse to be alone the family contacts paranormal investigators Ed (Wilson) and Lorraine (Farmiga) Warren to help them figure out what is going on. What they find is something that none of them could have imagined and could destroy the lives of everyone involved. I have said over and over that I am not a huge horror movie fan mainly because I'm not a fan of the 'let's chop people up' aspect. The ones that scare me are the subdued and psychological thrillers like Insidious and The Exorcism Of Emily Rose. This one can be added to the list. To me being alone in a house and seeing an empty baby roller chair moving on its own while you hear the music from a jack-in-the-box playing is way more terrifying then being chased by a man with a chainsaw. While this didn't scare me like the other two I mentioned it came close and this along with The Purge are the best horror movies to come out in a while. Overall, creepy and very much worth seeing if you want to see a true horror movie. I give it a B+.",7,0,1,14 September 2013
Prometheus," For a guy who wasn't a huge fan of the 'Alien' movies this was excellent. I really enjoyed it and recommend this. I say A.
","'You don't understand, this place isn't what we thought it was. I was wrong. We were so wrong. We must leave!' When scientists Elizabeth (Rapace) and Charlie (Marshall-Green) discover a pictogram that matches many others found around the world they think they finally have enough evidence of life from other worlds. They along with many others board a ship called 'Prometheus' to venture many light years away from Earth to test their theory. What they find is beyond what they were ready for, and more then they can handle. I have never really been a big fan of the 'Alien' movies but this one looked really good to me. I have to say this was much better then I was expecting. The beginning was interesting and once it got going it was a very tense and a sometimes scary experience. I have to admit that I was totally sucked in to the movie and it made me want to re-watch the other 'Alien' movies to see if this one gave me new found excitement for them. I recommend this to all sci-fi fans and for those that loved the original movies this is a must see. Overall, an extremely entertaining adventure that is well worth your time. The last scene gave me a chill. I loved it. The only complaint I have is that Charlize Theron's character seemed a little unnecessary. This like so many other prequels though fall in to the strange aspect of the technology of movies makes it seem like they had cooler stuff in the beginning of the sagas then in the originals which is set in the future.

After thinking something is wrong his wife begs him to go get them. Connor decides to travel to Turkey after the Battle of Gallipoli ends to find them and bring them home but he finds much more than he expected to. There are some movies that you watch and instantly know you like it. There are some that you watch and instantly know you hate it. Then there are movies like this one. Movies that keep you watching and interested and you like them but aren't exactly sure why. I am not a big Russell Crowe fan at all but there was just something about this movie that I really enjoyed and liked. It is not fast moving or full of action but it was a very good movie that I liked. Coming from a non Russell Crowe fan that is saying something.

After his daughter (Grace) was taken and he went through hell to get her back Bryan Mills (Neeson) made a pact to be a more involved father. Keeping true to his word Bryan, his daughter and ex-wife decide to take a family vacation. While they are relaxing the family and crew of the men that Bryan killed in the first movie plot their revenge on him and this time Bryan is the one who is taken. This is a movie I was a little leery about watching. I loved the first one but I was really worried that this would be the exact same thing and would ruin the way I feel about the original. I was wrong. While this did have many of the same aspects of the first one there was enough differences to make this almost as exciting as the first one. Not many sequels can compare to the original but this one is close. Just as fast moving and thrilling as the first and if you liked that one you will like this one as well. Not much else to say about it other then this was better then I expected and this is well worth seeing. Overall, not quite as good as the first one but pretty close.

Straight Outta Compton," A music bio-pic on par with Walk the Line and Ray. One of the best movies of the year.
","'You are about to witness the strength of street knowledge.' The 80's was dominated by groups like Bon Jovi and Wham. When 5 kids from California burst on the scene they not only changed music but attitudes as well. The meteoric rise to the top changed everyone's lives, and some friendships. I wasn't really sure what to expect from this movie. I love true stories, music and bio-pics but I was never really a fan of NWA. Growing up outside Detroit I heard them a lot growing up but I never really connected with it. All that aside this movie is outstanding. It grips you from the beginning and really keeps you until the end, which seems to come to quickly. Paul Giamatti is great in this, as usual, but the actors they picked to play the group are incredible and are the ones that really make the movie. I could really go on and on about this but just watch this. Even if you don't like the group, just watch it. The fact that this movie got overlooked at the awards is a travesty. Overall, a music bio-pic on par with Walk the Line and Ray. One of the best movies of the year. I loved it. I give this an A+.",10,6,34,19 January 2016
The Woman in Black," I was expecting more but this was good. Very creepy in parts and a shocking ending that helped. Very OK movie. I say B
","'It's not natural to lose someone so young, but if we open the door to superstition where does that lead'. Still trying to recover from the death of his wife, Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) leaves his young son in order to settle the estate of an English manor. The village residents do all they can to make him leave early because of the legend of the house. When Kipps discovers the secret he vows to stop it. I have to admit that I was looking forward to this movie mainly for the fact that this was 'Harry Potter''s first major non-potter movie. I was a little disappointed because of my high expectations. This is still a very good movie and there are some very very creepy things to keep you on your toes. I really just think that more could have been done with it. Some parts of the movie are very intense and keep you watching while others seem to drag and slow the movie down. The ending however really changes the way you feel and is a little shocking which to me made the movie better. I do recommend this one, but lower your expectations. Overall, a good movie with a great ending that is worth seeing. I give it a B.",6,1,3,16 April 2012
X-Men: First Class," A fantastic sequel/prequel and a great movie all around. Made me a fan of the series. Really great movie. I say A
","'I always knew I couldn't be the only one who was... different.' After Charles Xavior (McAvoy) meets Raven as a child his life takes on new meaning. When he runs into Erik Lensherr (Fassbender) as an adult he realizes that there is a group that needs to be accepted. The 'X-Men' are born. Having never been a big fan of the series I was not really looking forward to this movie. After watching it I became a fan. This movie is the expectation to the rule that the more sequels you make the worse they get. This one is the best of all of them. The fact that this movie is set against actual historical events makes this seem like more then another comic book movie. The origins of the 'X-Men' set against the Cuban Missle Crisis is great for a history buff like me. This is a movie that much like the 'Star Wars' prequels you don't need to see the others first, but you will understand more and get the call-back jokes. For someone who was not a fan of this to start with I loved it. For those that already are fans you will absolutely love this. For those who have never seen any of these before, this is a good start. Overall, not just a good sequel or comic book movie, but a great movie in general. Highly recommend. I easily give it an A.Would I watch again? - I saw in theaters, rented it and will buy it.*Also try - The entire X-Men series.",Null,0,2,7 September 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," Do not listen to anyone who says it's a woman hating porno...it is none of those things. Secretary was much more intense.
","'Mr. Grey will see you now.' Anastasia (Johnson) is a shy woman about to graduate college with no real plans for her future. When her roommate asks her to interview billionaire Christian Grey (Dornan) for the school paper she nervously accepts. He immediately becomes infatuated with her and does everything he can to win her over. When she finally accepts his invitation to his place she is shocked at what she sees. The two enter into a very strange relationship where neither fully understands what the other wants. This movie is a phenomenon and unless you live under a rock you know what the movie is about. Like you I knew about all the controversy going in and was really looking for what the fuss was about. 50% of the problems people have with the movie has to do with the fact that the woman is so submissive to the man therefore this portrays women in a negative light, by doing whatever a man says. The other 50% says its pornography and should be banned. I am a man but I have to think that all of the people that had this critique about this movie never actually saw it. While the movie does show sex acts rarely seen in a mainstream movie it is done more erotic than pornographic. I don't want to give anything away to the 5 people that haven't seen it or read the book but she is not as submissive as people will have you believe. I look at it as the other way around. For all the hype this movie has behind it, the movie Secretary is much more intense in terms of this subject matter. Overall, it could be because of all the hype surrounding it but I didn't see what the controversy was about. Do not listen to anyone who says it's a woman hating pornoit is none of those things. My wife really enjoyed it, but this wasn't what I was expecting at all. I give it a B-.",6,2,5,27 February 2015
The Wolverine," Doesn't have the feel of an X-Men movie at all. More like they added Wolverine to a samurai movie as an afterthought. I say C
","'You are strong. You have courage, real courage but that won't help you much now.' Logan (Jackman) is called to Japan by an old friend. What he finds is something he never could have imagined. For the first time in his live Logan is vulnerable and is pushed to his limits to not only save himself but to save those around him and even The Wolverine is no match for what he has to face. First of all I will say that I liked the first X-men and loved First Class but wasn't a fan of the others so I wasn't really looking forward to this one all that much. I am also not a comic book fan. I say that for two reasons. First I know the movie is based off a comic story line so fans of that will love this movie. For the casual X-Men fan like me this is nothing like an X-Men movie at all. Again even though this is based off an actual comic plot the movie felt like; 'Let's make a samurai movie.' 'No one in America would watch one though' 'Put Wolverine in it and they will.' Without trying to give anything away they could have done this movie with out the Wolverine character and it would have not changed anything. There is even a scene where he uses a Samauri sword to fight with instead of his claws...really. The best part of the movie is the little scene during the credits so be sure to watch that. Overall, this does not have the feel of an X-Men movie at all so if that's what you are looking for be warned. Comic book readers will love this though. I didn't. I give it a C.",5,0,2,11 October 2013
Win Win," A great movie about what is right for kids that is filled with great acting and heart. Giamatti is great as always. I say B+
","'The odds of this kid ending up on your doorstep...it's a sign.' Mike Flaherty's (Giamatti) law practice is failing. Running out of money he decides to risk his practice by agreeing to become the guardian of a wealthy client. When the clients grandson shows up to stay with him Mike takes him in and is amazed at his wrestling skills. When his mom shows up the entire plan, and family, is thrown into turmoil. This movie is very, very good. The acting is excellent (with Giamatti that's kind of a given) and the writing is great. The movie follows Mike and the decisions he makes that effect more then just him or his family. Much like the movie 'Gone Baby Gone' it deals with the scenario of if a kid is better living with a stranger then his own family. At the same time this movie is very funny, moving and thought provoking and is a great choice to rent for the night. The biggest problem that this movie has is that the family turmoil that is in this movie is overshadowed by 'The Beaver' and the awesomeness of that movie. Overall, a very, very good movie with great acting and heart. This movie will not disappoint.Would I watch again? - I think I would.*Also try - Little Miss Sunshine & The Winning Season",Null,0,1,21 August 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," No sequel can compete with the DARK NIGHT but this is as close as you can get. Perfect ending to the trilogy. I say A
","'You can watch me torture an entire city and when you have truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra's al Ghul's destiny... We will destroy Gotham and then, when it is done and Gotham is ashes, then you have my permission to die.' Eight years after Batman defeated the Joker and Harvey Dent's anti-crime bills became law Gotham is almost crime free. Bruce Wayne has become a shut-in and the Batman hasn't been seen in as long. When a psychotic ex-prisoner named Bane appears in Gotham and threatens to destroy Batman and the city Bruce is left to make a difficult choice. I have liked every Batman movie that has been made (except Batman & Robin) and this most recent trilogy has been amazing. They have all been really rich in story and they feel like movies and not just comic-book movies. I said when THE DARK NIGHT came out that no movie can live up to the hype of that movie but that came as close as you could. That movie set the bar for the franchise to an almost unreachable height and no sequel can really compete with that movie...but this one came as close as you could. While not as psychotic as the Joker, Bane is a great companion villain to him and is more calculating then the Joker was. There are many sub-plots going on but the movie doesn't feel jumbled at all. I have to say for Nolan to end this the way he did shows huge guts and if the studio was smart this would be the end of the franchise. While the Tim Burton movies were fun and good the Nolan trilogy had much more substance and I really don't think that the Batman character can benefit from a new director and style. He said this is his final Batman and as much as I hate to say it this should be the final movie in the franchise as well. In Hollywood though its the money and not the quality that dictates what is made. Overall, a perfect conclusion to the trilogy. I give it an A.",9,7,16,7 August 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The thing I liked most was that it had the balls to do what I have been criticizing the Marvel movies for not doing.
","'The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world. God vs man. Day vs night. Son of Krypton vs Bat of Gotham.' During the battle in the air between Superman (Cavill) and General Zod buildings are destroyed and people are injured. One of the buildings that were toppled was Wayne Tower and many of the employees were killed. Bruce Wayne (Affleck) feel that Superman is a danger to the city and wants him gone. What starts off as an intense hatred and rivalry soon becomes something more when the figure out the only way to save the city is to work together. It is very well documented that fact that I am not a bug superhero (other than Batman) movie fan at all. I think there are just too many of them to be exciting and there is no drama since you know the next 7 movies that will be made involving the same characters. I was also not a huge fan of Man of Steel. Because of those reasons I was not all that excited about this movie, and it could have been due to that, but I really liked this one a lot. There were some pretty big problems I had with some of the character choices, but none of that really affected the overall enjoyment of the movie. This is very very dark and not light hearted like the Marvel movies at all, which I liked. This movie did a good job of setting up the new DC universe, but the thing I liked most was that it had the balls to do what I have been criticizing the Marvel movies for not doing. For that reason alone I am looking forward to the next installment in this franchise. Overall, for someone that is sick of all the comic book movies being released I have to say I really liked this one and am looking forward to what's next for Batman and Superman. For what it's worth I highly recommend this and it continues the darkness that Nolan started. I give this an A-.",8,20,32,5 April 2016
Saving Mr. Banks," Even though Travers is an awful person I really enjoyed and recommend this. Overall, very good and very much worth seeing.
","'Winds in the east, mist coming in, like something is brewing about to begin. Can't put me finger on what lies in store but I feel what's to happen all happened before.' Walt Disney (Hanks) has a promise to keep to his kids. He promised them he would turn the Mary Poppins books into a movie. He has everything in line except the rights to the movie. After 20 years author P.L. Travers (Thompson) finally decides to come to L.A. and talk to him. That was the easy part. I was looking forward to watching this because I love the Mary Poppins movie. This was a good movie and I really enjoyed it but there is one thing that kept me from loving it. Emma Thompson is a great actress and she did a fantastic job as always but the character is so unlikable it distracts a little from the story. When you watch you will see what I mean. After reading about Travers, to find out that the movie is almost 100% accurate makes her that much more despicable. For a movie that I had high expectations for I really enjoyed this and recommend this. Overall, very good and very much worth seeing even though Travers is an awful person. I give this a high B+.",8,0,2,15 March 2014
Thor: The Dark World," I liked it and a good addition to the saga but I thought the first one was better. This one just had something missing.
","'It's a different world. Maybe they were different for a reason.' Two Years after saving New Mexico, Thor (Hemsworth) still thinks often of Jane (Portman) and vice versa. After receiving familiar signals on her equipment Jane and crew check out the source. What they find not only reunites them with Thor but also endangers Earth, Asgard and the entire universe. Having no other choice they all must unite with the enemy they most despise in order to save everything and everyone. As many of you know by now I am not a huge comic book movie fan. I will say that of the entire Avengers saga the first Thor was my favorite movie. Due to that I had pretty high expectations for this one. I won't say I was disappointed because I did like it but I didn't think it was as good as the first one. They can only do the superhero saving Earth story so many times so with this one they added the threat to Thor's home world as well. Most of the movie takes place on Asgard so that aspect was nice and it did have a fair amount of comedy to keep it entertaining all the way through. There was just something missing in this one that the first one had. I don't know if it was because my expectations for this one were much higher then the original but I didn't have the same enjoyment from this one the other had. All that said though this is a good movie and worth watching, especially to continue the complete story of the saga. Overall, good movie but I didn't think it was as good as first one. As always don't forget to keep watching through the credits...there are two extra scenes! I give it a B.",6,0,3,13 November 2013
Lucy," A good movie that had the possibility of being so much better.
","'If it really is CPH4 in that kind of quantity I'm surprised you're still alive.' Lucy (Johansson) is forced by her boyfriend to help with a business deal. When the deal goes south Lucy is forced into a position that she can't escape from. She wakes up with a bag of a new kind of drug inside her with instructions to deliver them within 24 hours. When she is attacked the drugs enter her drug stream with surprising effects. No with the help of Professor Norman (Freeman) she must escape the men who want the drugs back and figure out how to put her new found powers to the best use. First off I will say that this is a good movie but at the same time it is pretty disappointing. I feel like they could have done so much more with this but fell short a few times. This was much better then Transcendence but there was still something lacking to make it totally gripping and exciting. It is very much worth seeing though but temper your expectations. Overall, a good movie that had the possibility of being so much better. I give it a B-.",6,2,6,19 January 2015
Moonrise Kingdom," Fans of Anderson will love this movie. I thought it was OK but not his best. Worth seeing but not for everyone. I say B.
","'You two are the most appallingly incompetent custodial guardians Social Services has ever had the misfortune to encounter in a 27 year career.' While sitting down to breakfast one morning Scout Master Ward (Norton) notices that one of his troops is missing. He quickly calls Captain Sharp (Willis) and the word is passed on to the parents. When it comes out that the boy has run off with another local girl not only do the parents get involved but Social Services is called in also. This may end up being a pretty short review because since this is a Wes Anderson movie people have already kind of made up their mind on whether to watch or not. His style is not for everyone. To me I either really love his stuff or I don't. I really like almost all his work (I didn't like 'Royal Tananbaums') but to me 'Rushmore' and 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' are his best. This one is not at the level of those movies but this is still pretty funny. There are few directors that have a definite style and you know instantly that it's one of their movies. Anderson, Kubric and Hitchcock are the ones that come immediately to mind. Again though this is funny but not for everyone, very dry humor. Overall, if you like Wes Anderson movies then you will love this one, if not then it's 50/50 if you will enjoy it. I thought it was OK but not his best. I give it a B.",7,1,2,22 September 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Believe the hype. This is the Star Wars we have been waiting 30 years for. This is a must watch for any movie fan at all.
","'It's true. All of it. The Dark Side, the Jedi, they're real.' Thirty years after the defeat of Darth Vader and the vanquishing of the dark side not much has changed. A new threat called the First Order has risen with a new leader that is trying to bring back evil to the galaxy. The resistance, along with the First Order are working toward the same objective in hopes that they will be able to win once and for all. The new saga begins with the search for Luke Skywalker. In the last 20 years there have been two movies that have been hyped up to the point of insanity. The first one was The Phantom Menace. After years of waiting the movie turned out to be a tremendous disappointment and took some of the luster off of the series. Once again it is many years later and the hype is at a fever pitch, no movie can live up to that type of hype....except this movie. J.J. Abrams returns the series to an iconic status and starts to rebuild the legacy in ways not seen since the 80's. The movie is essentially review proof but I will say, believe the hype. This is the Star Wars we have been waiting 30 years for. Overall, forget how you felt about the release of the prequels, this is a must watch for any movie fan at all. I highly recommend it. I give it an A.",9,7,36,23 December 2015
RED," Great cast, good story idea, little flat. With the cast this movie had so much potential just never got on a consistent roll. I say B
","After an attack at home Frank Moses (Willis) recruits his old CIA buddies for help in revenge. Using all the tricks he knows Moses hunts down the person responsible for the attack while trying to avoid a tenacious CIA agent trying to stop him. This is another movie that falls into a common trap. Assemble an All-Star cast, realize everyone will watch for cast, slack off on rest. To me it feels like the bigger the stars put together the bigger the disappointment. I'm not saying this is a bad movie, it's just very average. With the cast assembled (and the Golden Globe nomination for Best Picture) I was expecting hilarious. It had funny parts, but a little flat in some areas. It sounds like I'm bashing it but it was a good movie. I was just expecting more. You will definitely have a good time watching, just don't get your hopes too high. The best part of the movie hands down is John Malkovich, watch for him if nothing else. I give it a B.",7,0,0,25 January 2011
Flight," One of the best movies of the year as well as an amazing performance by Denzel Washington. A definite must see. I easily say A.
","'The way you landed that plane was nothing short of a miracle.' Captain Whip Whitaker (Washington) is a great pilot. Mid-flight the plane he is flying begins to malfunction and lives are in danger. When his skill and quick thinking save the lives of most of the passengers he is called a hero. Then his past catches up with him and his career and life are in jeopardy. I was looking forward to this movie because of Denzel. After watching it I have to say not only was the movie fantastic but I am again amazed at how good he is in this. For someone of Denzel's stature usually you watch and only see the actor himself. For example I like him a lot but when I see Kevin Costner every once in awhile watching him I think that's him and it takes me out of the movie for a second. All that rambling is to make a point. The entire movie I didn't once see Denzel, all I saw was an alcoholic pilot who was trying to save his own skin. You aren't sure if he is a good guy or not throughout. I could go on and on about his performance but this is one that just needs to be seen. Besides the acting job the movie itself is great and affecting. This is an absolute must see. Overall, one of the best movies of the year as well as one of the best acting performances. I give it an easy A.",9,1,3,4 February 2013
The Purge," A movie that keeps you tense and on the edge of your seat the whole time. Much better then I expected. I recommend this. I say A-
","'This is the Emergency Broadcast System announcing the commencement of the annual purge as sanctioned by the US government. Commencing at the siren any and all crimes including murder will be legal for twelve continuous hours.' In the future America is flourishing. Almost no un-employment, crime or homelessness due to the fact that one night a year crime is legal. When the night rolls around again the Sandin family settles in inside their protected house and starts to relax. When the son, trying to do the right thing, protects someone in trouble it puts the entire family in danger and the house doesn't seem so safe. While this is a horror movie I do have to say that it's more along the lines of The Strangers then a typical horror. The plot of the movie isn't really that far fetched which makes it a little more terrifying. While I wouldn't call the movie scary I do have to say that it made me feel tense and edgy for almost the entire time. This is a movie that kept me interested and intrigued the entire time. The movie seems to only be filmed in extreme close-ups which adds to the horror aspect of it. It also makes you think how you would act if this actually was going on. I really enjoyed this much more then I expected to and I recommend this. Overall, much better then I was expecting and very tense the whole time. I like and recommend this. I surprisingly give this an A-.",8,12,25,6 August 2013
Godzilla," Not being a fan of the Godzilla movies I have to say this was better than expected. I just wish there was more of the monsters
","'This is not an electrical malfunction.' After a nuclear meltdown in Japan Joe Brody (Cranston) is forced to flee his home. Nothing ever set well with him about with the whole accident. When he is caught trying to sneak back into the city he is caught and his son Ford (Taylor-Johnson) must go get him. When a similar event happens Joe and his son are enlisted to help figure out what is wrong. It turns out that Joe's instincts were right. I will open by saying that I have never really been a big fan of Godzilla. I have only watched one of the original series and the 90's one with Matthew Broderick. Going into this one my only real expectation was that it will be better than that one. I was not wrong. That said the movie I think tried to do too much. The first half of the movie was watching the scientists try to figure out what was going on. When you sit down to watch a monster movie you really want to get right to the action. This is a movie I will review in two aspects. When the monsters were not on the screen the movie was a little slow moving and hard to stay interested in. The entire time you are just thinking blah, blah, blah lets see action. On the other hand when the monsters are on screen and fighting the movie is entertaining and I could have watched a movie of just that. Once again not being a fan of the Godzilla movies I do have to say this was better than I expected I just wish there was more of the monster aspect. Overall, better then expected and worth seeing but be prepared for the movie to drag a little when the action isn't happening. I give this a low B+.",7,1,4,13 September 2014
50_50," After 400 reviews I have found a movie that left me almost speechless. An amazing movie that needs to be experienced. I say A.
","'You can't change your situation. The only thing that you can change is how you choose to deal with it.' One day Adam (Gordon-Levitt) says that his back has been hurting and goes to the doctor. When Adam is told that he has cancer, and his odds of recovery are 50/50, his life is tossed into chaos. With help from his best friend Kyle (Rogen) and his new therapist he does what he can to try and beat it. In the last year since I began doing these reviews I have done over 400. In all that time I have found it pretty easy to write something about each one. This one is different. This movie is so emotional, funny and so well done that it actually left me without knowing what to say about it. I feel that anything I say may cheapen it and this is just a movie that needs to be seen. Very few movies have that kind of effect. Equal parts comedy and drama this is one of the best experiences I have had with a movie in awhile. The one comment I can make is that if you liked 'Funny People' you will love '50/50'. Overall, a movie that words can't do justice to. Just watch it. I say A.",9,0,0,18 January 2012
Deadpool," The best Marvel movie so far. A comic book movie made for everyone, not just comic book fans. I wish more were like this.
","'This is a different kind of superhero story.' Wade Wilson is a former Special Forces member who now works as a mercenary. He has the perfect girlfriend and everything is going his way. When he discovers he has cancer everything changes. When Wade is approached by a stranger with a way to cure him he takes the chance. It doesn't go as planned and now Wade has only one thing on his mind, revenge. If you have read any of my reviews before you will remember one thing, I am pretty much over the whole superhero movie trend. I am a huge Ryan Reynolds fan and this looked funny so I was looking forward to watching this one. This, to me, is hands down the best Marvel movie they have ever done. The movie is hilarious, very adult, and self aware, which I love. There are a ton of little inside jokes and the movie starts with maybe the best opening credits ever and ends with one of the best post credits scenes I have seen. Superhero movie fans will love this. Non-superhero fans (like me) will love this. This is just a fun movie that never really lets up. I just cannot recommend this enough. I loved it and my stomach hurt by the end of it. Overall, the best Marvel movie so far. A comic book movie made for everyone, not just comic book fans. I wish more were like this. I loved this movie. I give this an A+.",10,2,11,22 February 2016
Cloud Atlas," A movie I found very hard to follow and understand. The jumping around and make-up was distracting to me. I say C+
","'Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others. Past and present. And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.' This is usually the part where I give a little synopsis of what the movie is about before I give my opinion. The problem with this one is that I don't think I'm smart enough to tell you what the movie is about, mainly because I'm not 100% sure. I do know it's about how the life of one person affects others throughout time, but after that I don't know what to say. I'm sure many will figure it out and think I'm dumb for not catching on though. As far as what I thought about it...to me there was just too much of everything. The movie is basically little vignettes of characters that are supposedly connected to the others but it jumps around so much its hard to follow. Most movies like this have one main plot line they follow and branch off of that...this one just put them all together and I had a hard time following. The other big distraction was the make-up. I do like the way they had the same actors in each section to show their point but the whole time I was thinking...I think that's Hugh Grant, or is that Agent Smith? It seemed to take me out of the movie. It may seem like I'm bashing this movie but the truth is I couldn't follow it enough to form a real opinion. I will admit that by the end I thought I was following it a little better but this is one I am not smart enough for. Overall, to me this is another movie where the writers and directors try to prove they are artsy and smarter then the audience...congratulations...you win. I give it a C+",5,1,5,8 May 2013
Kingsman: The Secret Service," The fact that there are over 100 uses of the f-word take it out of the teenage crowd acceptability.
","'The suit is the modern gentleman's armor. The Kingsmen are the new knights.' Harry Hart (Firth) has just lost his partner and friend. When he goes to tell the wife he leaves a present for his son (Egerton). Years later they two meet up again, this time Harry is a recruiter. Together, along with the rest of the Kingsmen. they must stop the global threat Valentine (Jackson) has set up. Before I really looked at the rating for this I was expecting a teenage Cody Banks type movie. After seeing it was rated R I was confused. The movie is very much geared toward the teenage crowd, but the fact that there are over 100 uses of the f-word take it out of the teenage crowd acceptability. The fact that the movie is about a younger agent takes this out of the older crowd's desire to see this. Colin Firth is very good and this is a different part for him. The main problem is that the swearing and violence push it out watch-ability for the crowd it is intended for. Had the movie been the same without the swearing it would have found an audience. As it stands its in between those that can't see it and those that don't want to. Overall, adding the unnecessary swearing really hurt the movie badly. I give this a C+.",6,1,5,9 June 2015
The Hangover Part III," Unlike the 2nd one this is funny and different. A good conclusion to the trilogy. Even if you didn't like #2 watch this. I say B+
","'Feels good to be out. Tell no one. I'll be in touch, Chow.' Two years after the events of Bangkok the wolf pack is settling back into normality. Normal for Alan (Galifianakis) is not taking his meds and buying giraffes. After the death of his father the group gets together to take him to rehab. While on their way they get stopped and are given an ultimatum. They must find Chow, who has stolen money from this man, or their friend Doug will die. I enjoyed the first Hangover but didn't go crazy over it like everyone else. The second one I didn't like mainly because it was just a remake and rehash of the same jokes. I was a little leery going in to this one because of that. This one actually has a different plot and that fact alone made it better then the second one. Rather then piecing together the events of the previous night this one is about the events the group gets into trying to catch Chow (who in my opinion is the best part of the series). This isn't really a review that will convince you to watch or not watch since it is the third in the series, but I will say that I really liked this one more then I expected. Overall, if you liked the first two you will love this. If you didn't like the second one you will like this. I give it a B+.",7,1,3,7 October 2013
Fast Five," Easily the best of the series and very fun and exciting to watch. Not many car racing scenes, which I liked. I say B+
","'The guys we're after are professional runners. They like speed and are guaranteed to go down the hardest possible way so make sure you've got your funderwear on. We find 'em we take 'em as a team and we bring 'em back. And above all else we don't ever, ever let them get into cars.' After breaking Dominic (Diesel) out of the jail bus Brian and him move to Rio to start a new life of robbing and stealing. After Brian gets news that makes him want to stop running the team decides to pull off one last heist. I have never been a real big fan of the series. They are good but have mostly been 'I have car...I go fast.' The fourth one was the best because it actually had a story to it. Then I saw this one. Far and away the best of the series so far. For those that watched them for the racing I should warn you, there is only one scene in this one. This one was more in the style of 'Oceans 11' then a 'Fast & Furious' movie. I'm not sure if the sixth one they are making is needed, but like all movies lately they will make them until they make one too many...then the remakes start. That reason aside this is a very fun and exciting heist movie very much worth watching. Overall, I surprisingly liked it a lot and highly recommend this. I give this a B+.Would I watch it again? - I think I would, I can't say that about the other four.*Also try - Fast & Furious 1-4 & Takers",Null,0,1,3 October 2011
Inside Llewyn Davis," The acting is very good and the movie is OK but if you aren't a Coen Brothers fan you may not totally get into it.
","'If it was never new and it never was old its a folk song.' Llewyn Davis (Isaac) is a folk singer living in New York in the early 60's. He is trying everything he can to make it big while struggling to find his way. He couch hops from house to house and picks up gigs when and where he can. When the woman who's place he is staying with tells him he has to move out it begins a long week for Llewyn that changes everything about him. At the risk of offending people I am not a huge Coen Brothers fan. I have liked most of their movies but my problem with them is that some are very slow moving and are really made for a specific audience. The music in this one is good but not as good as in O Brother Where Art Thou. The acting is very good and the movie is OK but again if you aren't a Coen Brothers fan you may not totally get into it. This is a movie where not much happens you just follow one guy around for a week. Overall, Coen Brothers fans will like this. If you aren't a fan you may struggle to get through it.

The Cabin in the Woods," Not your typical horror/slasher movie. Equal parts comedy and horror made this really fun to watch. I liked it. I say B
","'This we offer in humility and fear, for the blessed peace of your eternal slumber as it ever was.' When five friends plan a weekend getaway to a secluded cabin things start off as planned. While relaxing at night they hear a strange sound, when the go off to investigate all hell breaks loose. One by one the friends begin to get killed off, then things start to get out of control. I have to admit that based off the few previews I saw this was not what I expected. I did enjoy it and it was a fun movie to watch though. The thing that kind of depressed me though is that this type of thing may not be that far away from reality. While there is the clichéd slasher movie aspects in this it is not your typical slasher type movie. This one had equal parts comedy and horror. That combination may turn off a lot of horror fans, but to me that made it a really fun experience. If you are looking for a true horror/slasher like 'Friday the 13th' this is not it. If you are looking for a good time and a horror you can laugh at then this is what you are looking for. Overall, a very fun experience. A comedy/horror that is worth checking out.

Spectre," Do not believe the negativity, this is a great movie. Almost a throwback film. I really enjoyed this a lot.
","'Welcome, James. You've come across me so many times, yet you never saw me. What took you so long?' James Bond (Craig) is becoming obsolete. With the advent and use of drones MI6 is debating whether to discontinue the 00 program. Bond is not helping and his wit and short temper has gotten him suspended. When he receives a message from his past he decides to track down the leader of the secret organization called SPECTRE and put an end to the pain once and for all. Full disclosure...I am a huge Bond fan. There have been very few Bond's that I haven't enjoyed (Timothy Dalton anyone?) and I was very excited about this one. I did hear some of the negative things said about it but still went in with an open mind. I enjoyed it quite a bit and loved all the call backs to previous movies. I did not expect this to be as good as Skyfall, that one was one of the best ones ever and it would be hard to follow. Daniel Craig has been so good in these movies that I think that he has become a victim of his own success. Of the four he has made I think this is the 3rd best, but being behind Casino Royale and Skyfall is nothing to be ashamed of. This movie also added a little more comedy than then others had and most people didn't like that. If you go back and watch the previous movies Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan had comedy all over their movies and it worked. It worked in this one as well, but because his have been so serious people weren't expecting this. This is a great movie and easily in the top half of all Bond films. Overall, do not believe the negativity, this is a great movie. Almost a throwback film. I give this a high B+.",8,3,8,17 November 2015

Joy (Lawrence) is a single mother who is trying to take care of her daughter, reclusive mother, ex-husband and her father (De Niro) who has recently moved back in with her. Everyone wants a piece of her and her time which leaves nothing for herself. One day while cleaning Joy invents a new type of mop. She soon finds out that inventing was the easy part, and get rich quick ideas are not all that they seem. This was a movie I wasn't all that excited about watching. One of the main reasons was because I didn't see how a movie about the woman that invented the Miracle Mop could be interesting at all. I was very wrong. The movie is surprisingly tense and interesting and really makes you feel happiness, anger and worry throughout. To me that is the sign of a good movie, by the way it makes you feel. I was almost immediately sucked in and interested and entertained the entire time. This is one of the biggest surprises I have seen recently and I actually highly recommend this movie. Overall, one of the best movies of the year and no matter how you feel about it going it this is one you should watch. Also features one of Jennifer Lawrence's best performances.

Her," A fantastic movie that is very original and another Oscar worthy performance by Phoenix. I highly recommend this.
","'She's not just a computer, she's her own person.' Theodore Twombly (Phoenix) is a lonely man who works writing letters for other people. He is going through a divorce and has very few friends. When he hears about a new advanced operating system he decides to give it a try and meets Samantha (Johansson) , his OS. What starts off as a better way to send and receive e-mails soon becomes something much much more and Theodore once again finds love and happiness. I have to begin by saying that I really enjoyed this movie. It was very original and entertaining. I thought Matthew McConaughey was the most deserving of the Best Actor Oscar...until I watched this. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in this and he basically did it all by himself with only an off screen voice as his supporting cast. All that said the movie also really makes you think about the subject matter and how far off we really are to this technology. I do also have to say that the movie may be a little too good at foreshadowing in the way that human interaction due to the new OS's becomes even worse then it is now. Scenes of people walking by one another without acknowledging another human because they are talking to their OS isn't really that far off from what is happening now. Social commentary aside I did really like this movie and I highly recommend it. Overall, a fantastic movie that is very original and another Oscar worthy performance by Phoenix.

Imperator Furiosa (Theron) is charged with leading a group to a distant city. When she takes a detour the ruler of the village isn't happy and sets out to find her and bring her back. Max and Furiosa form an unlikely alliance in order to save a group of prisoners from the tyrannical leader. I wasn't really looking all that forward to this movie. I wasn't a huge fan of the Mel Gibson series and wasn't expecting anything great from this movie. It may have been my low expectations but this movie wasn't that bad and it was pretty entertaining throughout. The best part of this movie is that it didn't try and do too much. It knew what the audience wanted and it is basically a 2 hour car chase movie. There is nothing amazing or horrible in this movie. On one hand it was better than I expected, but on the other hand it really didn't do anything to wow me or add anything extra special to set it apart from the originals, or Death Race for that matter. Nothing else really to say other than this is pretty much what you are expecting it to be. A very safe feeling middle of the road action movie. Overall, entertaining but didn't really take any chances and didn't set itself apart from other movies like this. It is very watchable though. I give it a B.",7,0,3,31 August 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," This is a fantastic movie that I highly recommend and I can see why it's up for Best Picture, but not at Private Ryan level.
","'I don't know how I'm gonna live with myself if I don't stay true to what I believe.' Desmond T. Doss (Garfield) has joined the Army. He wishes, more than anything, to serve his country in battle by becoming an Army medic. When his intentions to not carry a rifle are announced his entire company sees him as a coward and is put up for Court Marshall. After fighting the charge with everything he has Doss is allowed to serve, and becomes the first soldier in history to receive the Medal of Honorall without firing a single shot. This is a wonderful movie. The fact that it's true really helps the message and enjoyment of it, not to mention the acting by Garfield. This is a story that needed to be told, especially in today's climate and one that is worth watching, and must be seen. All that said I don't think this movie quite gets to the level of Saving Private Ryan or We Were Soldiers, but it is still one of the better war movies I have ever seen. The emotion and story of this one is what really makes it great and worth seeing. Overall, this is a fantastic movie that I highly recommend and I can easily see why it's up for Best Picture, but on the other hand I would be surprised if it actually won. Great movie, but not at Private Ryan level. I give this an A-.",8,5,8,25 February 2017
Warcraft," A very exciting movie with great effects that lost me a little bit in the story aspect, but fans of the game will love it.
","'From light comes darkness, and from darkness, light.' After their homeworld is threatened a horde of Orcs open a portal to the human world of Azeroth in hopes of conjuring it and claiming it as their own. The humans, led by Anduin (Fimmel) begin to fight back with the help of half-Orc Garona (Patton). The humans must not only fight of the oncoming Orc army, but also evil magic forces that threaten everyone involved, Orc and human. This is a movie I wanted to see even though I have never played the game before. My son plays it but honestly until this movie I didn't know the game even had a story to it. While I will admit the effects and action sequences are very exciting in this, this is not a movie for the casual fantasy fan. This reminded me of the Hobbit movies in the way that the movie expects you to come in with some knowledge of each race and back story. For those that have played the game that is not a problem, for the rest of us it comes across as confusing and muddles the movie a little bit. For me at least. Overall, a very exciting and action filled movie with great effects that lost me a little bit in the story aspect, but fans of the game, or this movie genre will love it. I give this a B.",7,0,0,27 September 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Typical Michael Bay movie, lots of action and effects, not much else. Much better then second. I say B+
","'There will be days when we lose faith, days when our allies turn against us. But the day will never come, that we forsake this planet and its people.' Once again Sam (LeBeouf) is stuck in the middle of trying to have a normal life and saving the world. After a 'lost' autobot is brought back to life Optimus Prime thinks peace has come at last. The decepticons have other plans. After the huge success of the first movie the producers decided to make a second, with out a real plot in place and it showed. Taking a little more time in developing this one also showed. Like 'X-Men' the background of this movie is historically real. Like any Michael Bay movie this is a movie that is based on special effects and explosions with little attention payed to emotion or story. I will give him one scene that was pretty emotional though. That said, not many people go into a movie like this for the acting or plot. The action and special effects were very good and this was a very exciting movie and very fun to watch. Overall, much, much, much, much better then the second one. Not quite as good as the first, but it's close. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - Yes I will.*Also try - Transformers 1 & 2",Null,1,4,15 September 2011
The Social Network," A movie about the founding of facebook, and the ensuing legal problems. I really enjoyed this, more then expected.I say A-
","Movie about the founding of facebook (was it stolen), and the legal problems Zuckerberg (Eisenbeg) faced. After his girlfriend breaks up with him Zuckerberg decides to get revenge on her by starting a billion dollar company. I have to admit going in I really did not have any desire to watch this being that I'm not into facebook(I don't even have a personal facebook page). Also from what I knew about Zuckerberg made me go in wanting to really hate the guy. The first half I found it easy, he was really cocky and only thought of himself. I don't know how accurate Eisenberg's portrayal was but he was pretty much what I expected. Has the movie progressed I started to feel sorry for him, Facebook took off too quick and he was at the mercy of everyone he came in contact with in order to be liked. For some reason when ever a movie takes over all media and becomes the place to be (like this one did) I have a feeling like I need to find something wrong with it so I can hate it, (like I do with Titanic...different review) but I found it difficult with this one. I'm not positive that it is good enough to win best actor or best picture at the Oscars but I would not be surprised if it did. I really liked it, much more then I thought I would. I give it an A-.",8,4,6,11 January 2011
In the Land of Blood and Honey," A good movie that is worth a watch but it seemed to try to hard to get emotions out of you. I give it a B-
","'My name is Danijel, I'm a criminal of war.' During the Bosnian war the Serbs would go town to town and kill the men and take the women. When a Serb soldier named Danijel meets someone he once knew and is torn between his feelings for her and his duty to country. This is a very difficult movie to review. I did like this but it had a few big flaws. One of which was that it seemed to try to hard. I know that Angelina Jolie is huge into drawing attention to this type of atrocity but after awhile it was like 'I get it, it was bad, please stop showing rapes.' This is a tough movie to watch but I will say that the fighting scenes and the acting were very good. I almost feel bad not liking it (which goes back to my comment about it trying to hard), but it seemed to lack real emotion to me. Instead of letting it come naturally you are almost forced to feel bad for the girl and to me that kind of loses what I think the real point of the movie was. I do recommend it but be ready for it. Overall, a good movie but it tried way to hard to create emotion which to me hurt the movie. I give it a B-.",6,12,35,16 March 2012
Macbeth," Fans of Shakespeare will love this, as for me, like most other things done by him I found it hard to get involved with.
","'It is a tale, told by an idiot. Full of sound and fury. Signifying nothing.' Macbeth (Fassbender) is a soldier who has just been told by a trio of witches that one day he will become king. This becomes the only thought in his mind and when he talks with his wife (Cotillard) he fulfills his own prophecy by killing the king. I have to start by admitting I am not a Shakespeare fan at all. I can't really even explain why but there is just something about his stories that I do not connect with. This one is no different. The acting is great and the plot is very interesting and exciting but I really struggled to get into it. Fans of Shakespeare will love this, as for me, like most other things done by him I found it hard to get involved with and my mind really began to wander. Overall, a good movie, just not for me. I give this a B-.",6,0,1,31 January 2016
The Great Gatsby," Much better then I was expecting. Slow start but makes you glad you finished. Never read book but I liked it OK. I say B.
","'When I came back from New York I was disgusted. Disgusted with everyone and everything. Only one man was exempt from my disgust.' Nick Carraway (Maguire) is a war veteran and aspiring writer who is working as a bond salesman on Wall Street. When he stops to visit his cousin Daisy and her husband he begins to see lies in the marriage. One day he receives an invitation to a party thrown by his millionaire neighbor Gatsby (DiCaprio) and his world becomes changed. This is a movie that I was really not excited about seeing at all. In spite of myself I am a DiCaprio fan and I have liked the movies that Luhrmann has made but to me the movie looked boring. I have never read the book so I wasn't really familiar with the story at all. I had an expectation of the style the film was going to be but that was about it. I thought the beginning was very slow moving and I was worried that the movie would not hold my attention. While it never really picked up too much I did find myself sucked in and am really glad that I stuck it out and finished it. To me this is not one of Luhrmann's best movies and it felt like a non-musical Moulin Rouge but it was much better then I was expecting. Overall, better then I expected. Starts off slow but does get better and better and makes you glad you finished it. I give it a B.",6,2,3,17 July 2013
13 Hours," The movie is not political at all and mainly focus on the soldiers decisions. I liked it more than I expected to.
","'Things change fast here in Benghazi.' Jack Silva (Krasinski) has just been reassigned as a guard for the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. What starts off as a routine assignment changes on September 11, 2012. When a group of insurgents breach the Embassy and attempt to kill the US Ambassador, Jack and his group of 6 have to make a decision. Follow orders and stay away, or disobey their commander and go help their fellow soldiers. I was looking forward to watching this, but I was also a little worried at the same time. The story is interesting and somewhat controversial and is a perfect idea for a movie, but it was directed by Michael Bay. For that reason I was expecting a lot of special effects and explosions and didn't think he was the director that should be in charge of this story. I'm not ashamed to admit that I was wrong. This is a realistic war movie that doesn't embellish the drama or actions, mainly because the story didn't need it. The movie is not political at all and mainly focus on the soldiers decisions. I liked it more than I expected to. Overall, not just a surprisingly good Michael Bay movie, a good movie period. I give this a high B+.",8,82,113,4 June 2016
Warm Bodies," A very funny zombie/love story movie that is worth watching but seemed to drag itself to the end. I do recommend though. I say B
","'What's wrong with me? I just want to connect, why can't I connect with people? Oh, right...it's because I'm dead.' R (Hoult) is a zombie, a very depressed zombie looking for meaning in his life. After him and a group out looking for food find a pack of young adults they begin to feast. When R eats someone he sees his memories, then changes his mind and saves his girlfriend Julie (Palmer). The two begin a relationship that may change the world forever. This is a very funny movie that just seemed to run out of steam a little over halfway through. The movie is very much worth watching and actually turns out very sweet, if not a little too perfect. The only real problem is that after awhile I started to lose interest a little and seemed to really drag toward the end. I still recommend this movie but it's not as good as Zombieland or Shaun Of The Dead. Overall, very funny movie but just couldn't maintain the beginning excitement the entire way. I give it a B.",6,0,1,15 April 2013
Sully," This is a movie that is nearly perfect. Much like Apollo 13, just because you know the end doesn't mean you know the whole story
","'Why are they looking for what we did wrong when it all turned out right?' Chesley Sullenberger (Hanks) is an ordinary pilot about to fly from New York to Charlotte. Almost instantly his plane is hit by birds and the engines fail. What he does next changes his life, and his passengers forever. This is a movie that starts with a problem. Everyone knows what happened with this event so it would seem that some of the drama would be missing. Much like Apollo 13 this was not the case. The movie is a mix between flashbacks of the event and the subsequent investigation that just makes you angry. I was not aware of the extent the FAA went to try and prove what Sully did was dangerous and wrong. I don't want to spoil this, if that's possible but I do have to say that the emotion in this movie is front and center and I did tear up a few times. To me that is based on the magic of Tom Hanks. Everyone knows that everyone survived, but his reaction is priceless and makes you feel extreme joy, as if hearing it for the first time. This is a movie that is nearly perfect and one that I highly recommend. Overall, much like Apollo 13, just because you know the end doesn't mean you know the whole story. I give this an A+.",10,1,2,20 December 2016
Draft Day," Costner's sports movie magic is back & this movie did the impossible. It made you root for a sports executive. I loved it!
","'No one can stop a ticking clock, the great ones always find a way to slow it down.' Sonny Weaver Jr. (Costner) is the GM of the Cleveland Browns and is getting ready for today's NFL draft. He isn't in good graces with the Brown's fans but that all changes when he makes a trade for the #1 pick. With pressure from the owner, his new head coach and his mother, Sonny isn't sure if what he wants is the same as what everyone else wants. His choices not only affect his job but everyone around him as well. I am a sucker for sports movies and I really like Kevin Costner so I was really looking forward to seeing this. Almost right away I was sucked in and enjoyed myself the entire time. This is very much like Moneyball so if you liked that movie you will like this as well. Costner is a perfect choice and there is just something about him and sports movies that is perfect. The movie is about the decisions people make when adding a player to their team, it may not seem like it but its exciting and keeps you guessing and wondering the entire time. You really root for Costner the entire time and want him to succeed. Again, it may be because I am a huge sports fan but I loved this movie and I highly recommend this. Overall, if you liked Moneyball you will love this one. I give this an A.",8,47,70,26 April 2014
The Martian," This is a movie that is done well, super entertaining and one that you can watch over and over again. I highly recommend this.
","'At some point, everything's gonna go south on you and you're going to say, this is it. This is how I end. Now you can either accept that, or you can get to work.' Finally a manned mission to Mars has taken place and a group of astronauts are conducting tests on the planet. When a storm hits the crew tries to make it back to their ship but Mark Watney (Damon) is struck and lost. With no other choice the crew leaves without him and they fear the worst. When Nasa receives a message from Mark a plan is needed not only to retrieve him, but to find a way to keep him alive on a barren planet. Mark must see how resourceful he can be. Every once in a while a movie comes out where you want to tell everyone you know to see it because its that good. This is one of those movies. To me the sci fi genre has had a strong showing the last few years with movies like Gravity, Intersteller and now this one. This movie has suspense, drama and a ton of comedy. This is one of the most entertaining times I have had watching a movie in a while. This is a movie that is done well, super entertaining and one that you can watch over and over again. Overall, a movie that had the suspense of Apollo 13 but lighter and more fun to watch. I highly recommend this. Watch this today. I give this an A+.",10,4,9,6 November 2015
The Fighter," A cross between Raging Bull and Rocky, not quite as good as either, but very close. Christian Bale made the movie. I say A-
","Can you follow your dreams without your family? After a lifetime of being in his brothers shadow Micky (Wahlberg) finally gets the title shot he has been looking for. The catch is neither his brother (Bale) who has trained him his whole life, or his mother (Melissa Leo) can have anything to do with him. This is a great movie. It is a boxing movie, but much like 'Raging Bull' boxing is only part of the story. The focus is mostly on the family and how important they are in Micky's life, and how they don't always return the love and need Micky has for them. Being a true story (also like 'Raging Bull') makes this movie much more enjoyable and tense, knowing that all of what is happening really went on. Amy Adams is great in the movie. This is a total departure from what she usually does (if you don't believe me watch this and then 'Enchanted'). But I think this movie would not have been nearly as good without Bale. To me he made this movie. I felt it was a cross between 'Raging Bull' and 'Rocky', almost as good as both of them. I give it an A-.Would I watch again? - Yes I would",8,0,0,14 March 2011
Furious 7," Fans of the series will love this. I liked this more than I expected and I thought it was the 2nd best in the series.
","'This time it ain't just about being fast.' Brian (Walker) has moved on from his fast lifestyle and is settling into fatherhood. When the brother of an old enemy shows up for revenge Brian, Dom (Diesel) and the rest of the gang are thrown back into the furious world they have come to know. This is a movie that is pretty much review proof. Being the 7th movie in a series it already has a built in audience, as well as those that want to see this because it's Paul Walker's last movie. I have to start off by saying that I have never been a fan of these movies. They are just too over the top and cheesy for me to fully get into. All that said I do have to admit that this is the 2nd best in the series I think (after Fast 5). The stunts are very over the top, but not as bad as the last one. The real downfall of this movie is Vin Diesels dialogit's so bad. The one liners made me laugh rather than having the dramatic effect he was going for. Again though this is review proof and you will either see it because you have seen the rest, or you won't for the same reason. I will say that the ending was very nice and really closed the movie (and series) up nicelybut they are making another one, because god forbid they end this. Overall, fans of the series will love this. I liked this more than I expected and I thought it was the 2nd best in the series. I give it a B.",7,0,13,15 May 2015
