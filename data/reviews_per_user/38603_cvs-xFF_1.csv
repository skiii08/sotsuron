The Ring," good idea with bad realization
","I watched this film 2 years ago but I remember it for long time Many people criticized this film like this: 'In this film fear is a result of terrible face, harsh sounds ... And Japanese version better' I think in this film the action is not main thing but only a scene,space. And main in this film I think is to show people, their relations...to help people became a bit kinder. And this film shows this. In this film Samara wasn't an absolutely evil. She had some singularities. And her adoptive parents put her into psychiatric hospital where she was alone for many hours, she lived in a stable and in the end her adoptive mother broke her in the well. As for me it is a enough reason to take offense. Some people write that it is very non-original and stupid story and many films has story like this. Yes this story is very simpler than story in book of Koji Suzuki. But main mean of this is not a difficult, long and very interesting criminal story. Americans when they were making this remake they didn't understood this idea. They tried to make a very scary film. So they put this in their film (this history is modified history from book of Koji Suzuki) but their main intensification was directed to make a good action. So this film has a good history of Samara with bad and stupid history of Rachel and company.",7,2,4,23 August 2007
