Sucker Punch," Not at all what I expected...
","Let me preface this by saying that I was rather apprehensive to watch this film. I ran across a trailer recently and failed to remember any mention of it after it came out back in 2011. I then instinctively came to IMDb to check the reviews out... Needless to say, the very average rating was disheartening. The movie did have my curiosity, however. I just finished watching the film, and I must say, it is certainly worth the watch. I think one of the reasons some people scored it so low is because they didn't go into it with an open mind. The trailer certainly leads the viewer to believe it is an action flick with boobs and maybe some mind games thrown in. This is not the way to approach this movie though! It is a quirky and very unique two hours, so don't expect it to be a 'normal' experience. I don't want to give any specifics on the movie because I really do feel like it would be appreciated most by someone who doesn't know what they're about to see. I will, however, tell you that what you'll see with this movie is a fun, entertaining, beautifully shot (or rather, generated), and SMART film. That's just my two cents. If you're looking for a fun movie to rent and maybe watch with a couple of friends, please consider picking this up, even if it's just to enjoy your fantasy of eye-candy bouncing around with swords and short skirts.",8,3,4,22 September 2014
