Source Code," Best review about this movie, yet
","This movie shamelessly uses computer science (specifically computer programming) jargon (about 5-10 terms, like 'specification', 'drivers', 'Source Code', etc) for a completely different purpose. For the kind of arrogant bullshit this movie presents (which is NOT science fiction, it's the new genre: bullshit fiction) it should be banned for reasons of subculture and attacking the sanctity of computer science, the most advanced and helpfull science we've got, the pinacle of civilization.The dialog is complete bs, not just because of the misused jargon, but mainly because it tries hard to be militaristic and 'sf' (trust me, it's actually bullshit fiction).The special effects are not there. Even if the train crash is played repeatedly, it's just some fire covering the train, and lots of noise. That's about it. Nothing more to see. No train wrecks, no real accident. NOTHING.The final scene tries to be something like the 'Matrix Effect' with the camera moving around while everything is still. Unfortunately it is just a collage of people's pictures and the 'camera' just zooms out (train background, people's pictures). It is so obvious, it shouldn't have been done. It's not 2011 worthy.The plot is made of holes: - How can a human mind have enough information about every single corner on that train, including contents of books, or what's concealed in the ceiling (note that the attacked did not die in the train wreck)? - Even if we supposed that maybe they reconstructed the information from all the dead people, there still wouldn't be enough to 'mimic' people's reactions (the information was reconstructed from a single person) - If the 'big bad quantic theory bullshit computer' already had the information about the train and it's 'contents', then it already knew where the bomb was. Why was it necessary for the wimpiest soldier ever in cinema to play with to find out where it was? -How in hell did the main character sent a SMS message from one parallel world to another (also there's a moral issue about taking that teacher's life/place - so he can be with that girl). -The nuclear 'bomb' is so small (smaller than a little TV). Wtf, nuclear bombs are huge. They don't fit into a little box, and don't have Christmas lights on them.There is a lot of propaganda about 'terrorism' and it actually contains brain washing patriotic stuff like reasons for a soldier to die for his country (for example, it is told to the soldier, that he must stay alive and keep fighting (searching) so he can serve his country, by finding out where bomb which will kill the entire city of Chicago).The soundtrack, the acting, the camera moves and general pace of the movie try to create a state of suspense. It did work for idiots, didn't work for the rest of the audience (you don't want to know the kind of people like the movie, I interrogated a lot, and really, only complete idiots).Please stop making movies like these. At least invent your own words for the kind of bs you present. When I heard 'charge the drivers' I was gonna leave the cinema, too bad I was with someone else.",1,91,194,25 April 2011
