Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A Bunny's Tale
","WFRR is a great technical achievement and wondrous film. It takes place back in 1947 where toons are a part of Hollywood. The hustle and bustle of Hollywood no longer belongs to the real world as both toons and humans collide.Roger Rabbit is a toon who stars with his co-worker Baby Herman in short episodes which he can't seem to get right. Eddie Valiant is a broken man after his partner/brother is killed by a toon with psychotic tendencies. He is hired by R. K. Maroon to see if Marvin Acme is having relations with the embodiment of lust, Jessica Rabbit. Of course these acts are simply 'pattycake' but to toons it's an act of divorce until Acme is killed. Believing Roger Rabbit to have killed him a warrant is put out.The movie has excellent pacing and gives us a treat for our eyes. Beautifully animated characters and acting gives us one of the greatest experiences of our life time. Too bad it has a 7.6 it should have a 8.8 but for me it's a solid 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,29 January 2010
World War Z," Misjudged Zombie Movie
","I am a huge zombie fan and of course I had to check this out. After reading the book I knew the movie wasn't going to be like the book. Due in fact to the words 'production problems' seriously why does everyone think it's code word for 'Don't worry we are polishing this movie/game. There is no problems at all.' I know I'm ranting at this point but seriously you people need to learn English.Anyway I sat down in a not so packed theater. A group of teens, an old couple and several couples with young children. The parents with children all left. The teens were horrified and the older couple were also enjoying themselves and you know what so was I. It's not perfect film but people are so damn hard on this film due to The Walking Dead. Let me say this after the first season WD was losing steam. I stopped watching when the second season was over.Now onto the film oh god. Our hero Brad Pitt Er Gerry is normal ex- government man. On this particular day he drives through Philly and everyone knows from Romero movies Philly is the best place for a zombie flick. Soon zombie's plow through human meat and the story lumbers for a bit. I won't lie the film is slow...at really small intervals. I never felt bored with this film just angry at some idiots within this film.Gerry's wife calls him in the middle of a big event which gets people killed. A bunch of Hebrews sing and then out of nowhere wall crawling zombies because sound draws them in. These two moments made me want to punch these people. Not the writers or producers. These everyday people who screw up. That was smart because as humans we can screw up big time. Despite this I enjoyed the zombie effects and horror elements. Sure they weren't very scary but still effective. You see people want a direct adaptation of the book weren't doing research. I looked stuff up and they didn't. OK again rant over. My problem with this movie isn't anything too terrible.First the formula was just stock. Gerry goes somewhere bad stuff happens. He goes somewhere else bad stuff happens. See formula, not a good thing. Second the inclusion of his family. Yeah he has one but nothing comes from it. They are just there unfortunately. Third unfortunately was the cgi. I know people have said it before but oh well. This movie could've used people for zombies but no, some scenes are just cg. Not saying it breaks the movie but good god hire people.Despite this I did enjoy this movie it was fun and very pleasing to this zombie fan. Overall 7 out of 10.",7,3,5,17 October 2013
Jurassic Park," A Classic Movie
","If you lived in the 90's you know this movie was big. However I was a child when I saw this I was freaked out just by the first two minutes. After a few years it resurfaced on a VHS tape. Again I was too freaked out but this time by the T-Rex. Finally the third time was the charm. Me and a friend sat down and watched it. I couldn't believe what I missed. After 12 years of watching 'Walking with Dionsaurs' I finally got that 'Holy crap that was awesome'.The movie itself has a good plot. After finding Dino D.N.A. scientists manage to clone Dinosaurs. After a fews they need an endorsement from someone. They find three people and of course at first everyone wants too. After a greedy Newman powers down the park and Dino's rule the land. The movie goes far to show these Dino's are beyond our imagination. The T-Rex is an all powerful creature, the velociraptors are smart and deadly.The CGI in this film is really well done. I really can't tell the difference between robotic. The actors show the emotion that most people would show when seeing these creatures. Even the score was amazing which was done by John Williams.Overall my favorite Dino movie.",10,2,3,12 September 2010
