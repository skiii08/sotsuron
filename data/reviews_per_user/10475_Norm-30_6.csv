The Blair Witch Project," An Over-rated Film
","I have to admit that this concept is revolutionary, and lends to  it's realism.  The acting is incredibly intense.Now, the downside.  The constant hand-held camera shaking got to be very annoying in spots; I didn't get sick, just annoyed!Also, the 'sounds' they heard at night were so faint that you can hardly make them out, due to the sounds of them moving in the tent, whimpering, etc.Even tho this film can have NO ENDING, they should've showed the 'intro explanation' for about 10 secs before the end credits rolled. This would've brought it 'home' more, with less than a 'hanging feeling'.If you want to see a MUCH better film, check out the 'SixthSense'!   Norm feeling'.",4,0,3,17 August 1999
Ed Wood," Pure Garbage!
","As a Bela Lugosi film collector, I HAD to see this film...... and what I saw angered me to NO END!!!!! I have every Lugosi film except for 5 (the rarest of the rare!) and know quite a LOT about his life. Tim Burton depicted him as a bumbling simpleton, which really got me angry! Lugosi's latter years were NOTHING like Burton depicts them, and he should be ashamed for his treatment of this Great Actor! I'm told that Bela Lugosi, Jr. didn't like it very much, either, and attempted to sue Burton.....it's a shame he didn't win his lawsuit. Mr. Burton, you will be forgotten in 5-10 years from now -- but Bela Lugosi will Live FOREVER!!!!!Norm   (PS  Tim Burton is JUST AS LOUSY a 'filmaker' as Ed Wood!  What a MISFIT!",2,5,38,30 March 2000

The Mummy Returns," Better than the first one!
","The story, action, and special effects come fast & furious in this one! Some parts of this film contain comical 'bits' (like when the boy has to go to the bathroom on the train) that remind one of the 'Indiana Jones' films.The special effects are INCREDIBLE; I especially like the 'mummy fight' scene on the double-decker bus!The ONLY special effect that looks kinda 'fake' is the Scorpion King at the end of this film; it doesn't look real AT ALL! (especially the 'human' part).  I noticed that it moves rather quickly, as if the effx people realised that it wasn't quite 'up to snuff', and didn't want you to get a good look at it.Even so, I HIGHLY recommend this film!Norm Vogel   normv@blast.net",10,0,0,20 May 2001
It's a Wonderful Life," Review (pan!) Pls publish this, for an alternate 'take'.
","I've been collecting (& watching) old films for over 20 years, and have over 700 in my collection.  Call me 'Ebeneezer Scrooge', but I think that 'Wonderful Life' is one of THE WORST films I've ever seen!!!! (I'm not kidding).People today are amazed that it got such lousy reviews when it premiered; I feel that audiences THEN could see what a bad film it is!What's wrong with it?  First, the pacing.  The first half of the film (where all the 'bad stuff' happens) is MUCH too long; it goes on FOREVER.  The part after his suicide attempt is much too short, and doesn't dispel the 'depressing-ness' of the beginning.  Plus, the scene where the clerk hits young Stewart on the ear is an extremely brutal (& violent) scene for that era; it STILL bothers me!If you want to see GOOD Capra, check out 'Arsenic & Old Lace', 'Lost Horizon', 'Lady For a Day', 'You can't take it with you'.....in fact, any film BUT this one!It may be a 'Wonderful Life'.....but, it's a lousy movie!",1,37,93,24 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," A Most Unusual Film!
","This is the story of a small boy who sees 'dead people' and of the psycologist who tries to help him.  This film is reminiscent of the film 'Ghost' and the 'Twilight Zone' as well.  My ONLY complaint is that the first half of the film is a a bit 'show'....one wishes he would see MORE 'dead people'!And, the ending is a SHOCKER!  If you see this film, don't give it away!   Rod Serling would be PROUD!Norm",9,0,0,14 August 1999
