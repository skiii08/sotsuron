Vertigo," As I Grow Old, Part 2
","For reasons pretty much spelled out in my review of The Bridge on the River Kwai, this is another film that I appreciate more with age.I can be succinct about this. James Stewart's performance is his best. His character's obsession, whether or not you think it the result of unconscious seduction, is made all the more gripping because we are so much more accustomed to his portraying characters who are direct, purposive, honest and forthright. In a sense Scottie is...until he isn't.Kim Novak is, simply put, beautiful to the point of unearthliness. But this triangle has four sides, and Barbara Bel Geddes is also very much the player. She too is beautiful...or at least given her profession you get the idea she full well knows how to judge beauty...yet she cannot possibly compete with Scottie's fixation, which makes her recognizing that all the more painful and the instant focus of our sympathy.Where does age come in? How readily each of us can place ourselves in each character's shoes. The smug would doubtless think, 'You can't always get what you want,' but how long did it actually take each of us to learn that? Not only the players but Hitchcock himself had to have known and understood that, and in his peerless directorial fashion he enhanced the portrait, adapting even the surroundings to suit. To me the plot is at times but a contrivance...until the very end.A postscript concerning Bernard Herrmann's musical score: Get a good recording and play the opening theme at theater volume without any visuals or even an attempt to recall the Saul Bass title sequence. In fact, darken the room you're in or listen at night. The music throbs and pulsates. Brilliant.",10,7,9,27 June 2009
United 93," The Fact Is
","NO ONE knows what happened on board the subject flight. We can only infer. We know only the outcome. If you keep THIS fact in view you need not worry over how good a documentary this film appears or pretends to be.Paul Greengrass did not set out to make a documentary. He said so from the outset. He says so in his DVD commentary. If others call into question his detachment, perspective, integrity or sense of timing I commend him for his skill, tact and honesty. Was he opportunistic? If you make a film it had better be about something you care very much about. No matter what he had aimed for he had to know the end result would be viewed through the lenses of many others who knew what they thought had happened. Faced with this challenge his direction, writing and editing earned their professional recognition.It's hard enough to move within a Boeing 757 when it's powered down on the tarmac. And try sitting through a transcontinental flight on a clear day with your eyes volitionally closed from takeoff to landing. For these reasons Barry Ackroyd's photography deserves special praise. It strives to emulate what you would see and the way you would see it if you were on board.The sound and sound editing are spot on. John Powell's minimalist musical score is sobering and complements the film perfectly, for without the stream of images I find the score unlistenable.Before James Cameron's film, when I'd heard a Broadway stage musical version of the Titanic disaster was in production, I'd thought the effort at best supremely callous. That view changed when I later learned the cast members, without prompting or compensation, visited the families and descendants of the victims each was cast to portray as well as the very few remaining survivors and their families. The results showed on the stage. It appears a very similar approach was taken here.Should the film have been released first-run as a commercial feature let alone made so soon? It's been seven years as of this writing. We are at times blessed with short memories and faulty recollections. The events were thrust upon us. The film is not, for one either views it or doesn't. That should always be a choice resorted to and exercised with gratitude.",9,2,3,20 November 2008
Watchmen," I Watch the Watchmen (Again)
","My first viewing kept me awake during a transatlantic red-eye. Earbuds don't quite work for me so I kept it only on video. In a phrase, visually arresting, but by the end I rubbed my eyes and muttered, 'Um...say what?' That didn't prompt me to read the source graphic novel. It still hasn't. But two recent re-viewings provoke the same odd attention from me as did The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: There be Acting here.Jackie Earle Haley is superb as a masked vigilante who feels faceless without the mask. Given what she has to play off of, Malin Ackerman keeps your attention throughout...sometimes that's all that's needed...and her scenes with a crudely made-up Carla Gugino remain special. And given what the FX crews do to him Billy Crudup's portrayal of a godlike being is singular and striking.Matthew Goode is spot-on as The Man Who Has Everything (If No One Interferes). Patrick Wilson is quietly hilarious as a conflicted and at times distracted Clark Kent who truly needs 'the suit'. And Jeffrey Dean Morgan captures perhaps the most prismatic hero of all, for compared with Haley's character who feels compelled to punish, Morgan's enjoys that.As I felt with LXG, you truly do start to believe in these deeply flawed paragons of...well, if not virtue then let's say idealism. And whether or not it was done for those familiar with the graphic novel, much thought was put into the portrayals, and at least to me the results clearly showed on-screen. Hat's off for that.",7,1,3,18 February 2012
Ratatouille," But Only the Fearless
","Uneven, imperfect, illogical (so are all the other Pixar film subjects), and formulaic, but you forget all that as you are quite literally swept into a satisfying conclusion to a fable on the art and business of cooking. Ratatouille resonates in true Pixar style. Don't be surprised if it earns a bushel of nominations and quite possibly a Best Director award (or two).If Peter O'Toole deserves accolades for his voice characterization, Ian Holm must have been a joy to watch in the recording booth, and at a distance. And twice in the film Brad Garrett had tears coming out of my eyes within a matter of seconds.I don't know whether to be impressed with, or seriously creeped out by, the staggering photo-reality of Pixar's animation. Way down among the end credits was a '100% Animation' logo, 'No Motion Capture Was Used In The Making Of This Film' or some such. That may have been an inside joke, but starting with The Incredibles I'm convinced Pixar's aiming to make its movies look like—movies!In this light, I've seen rats up close and personal (don't ask). A rat swarm evokes the most primal of responses, and a wet rat is not in need of compassion. You favor your kids by instructing them after the matinée that these particular rodents are not overgrown field mice, truly don't look or behave like Remy or Emile or talk like Brian Dennehy, and should absolutely not be fed from the hand or even at the end of a very long stick.I'm past the point of feeling compelled to categorize each Pixar flick as better or worse than its kith, for each manages to be unique regardless, and all pretty much transcend the medium. Suffice it to say some make me laugh louder than a screen full of humans manages to.But it isn't about the rodents. And that's the trick, folks: It's all fun in the telling.",8,1,5,7 July 2007
Brave," Be Careful What You Wish For
","I thank my youngest sister and niece for again compelling me to view a Pixar movie on the big screen.In short, it was not what I'd expected: Warrior Princess Proves Herself to Manly Men. And the less you expect of the film I believe the more you will enjoy it.It's either me or the editing throughout runs too fast to catch every detail. Still, I could SEE Emma Thompson in her animated character's every move and nuance. And Patrick Doyle's musical score is excellent.But I need emphasize that the final confrontation is the most violent scene I've ever witnessed in a Pixar movie. Let's just say the makers did their homework in spades.And this is why I believe that, in the midst of generating Cars V6 and Toy Story 4D, Pixar will someday produce a film that will purposely frighten a great many people of all ages. Hat's off for that.",8,1,1,7 July 2012
The Dark Knight," The Joke's On Us
","...for, simply put, this is to comic book/graphic novel adaptations what The Godfather, Part II is to gangster movies. Relentlessly dark, brooding, tangled, mythic, disturbing, none of that alternating, and then some. Long, too. It is neither uplifting nor a place to park the kids.I devoured my share of comic books when much younger, and felt obliged but not compelled to sample their motion picture adaptations. In particular, no fan of the Batman series am I. Tim Burton aimed for weird and hit the target. Joel Schumacher aimed for Ken Russell and missed oh so wide. Christopher Nolan and company got the keys to the franchise and did something certifiably different. Hat's off for that.In sum...About a half-hour too long, and that final half-hour was action-packed befuddlement capped by not one but two unnecessary speeches that were effectively blotted out by that packed action.Heath Ledger's performance will echo in your mind for some time to come. It had to have echoed in his own. Grant the man rest.So will, or should, the performances of everyone else, most notably Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman for their respectively surprising turns of character.With age Eric Roberts looks like Willem Dafoe, and Nestor Carbonell looks unnervingly like Peter Mark Richman.I believe we're close to breaking the sound barrier of digital FX, where you don't appreciate them 'til they're hurled at you and can't appreciate them when you do.I've heard my share of edited gunshots and explosions for the year and quite possibly the next two or three. But at least the violence wasn't stylized. If I wanted that I'd rent A Clockwork Orange.What awards this film will win will be well and truly earned. All the same I can't guess where the franchise will go next. I sincerely hope it's left where it is, with the goal of applying the same considerable attention and resources to finding, learning, articulating and displaying something novel. The participants in this film are surely capable of all of that...",7,9,16,3 August 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Best In Show, Once and Future
","I could go on quite at length about 2001. Plenty others have, so I'll just try to tether the following comments to the personal and at-times parallel odyssey of this particular user.Some years before its premiere a grade-school librarian had the good taste and uncommon foresight to round up select classes, seat them in the library or small auditorium, gently command their collective attention and silence, hand out papers with colored pencils or crayons, set a vinyl LP or two of highbrow music on a mono phonograph, and say, 'Draw!' ('What?' 'Anything.')Months before the premiere an assigned middle-school reader included Arthur C. Clarke's short story, 'The Sentinel,' which inspired me to visit the local public library and ask if Mister Clarke had written anything else, prompting the on-duty librarian to point to a bookshelf and a half.I'd asked my parents to take me to the first-run in my hometown, shown on a decidedly non-Cinerama screen. Towards the end my mother was asleep on my left shoulder and my father asleep on my right. I could well have been the only person besides the projectionist awake in the theater (well, perhaps not), and the appearance of the Star Child very nearly scared the marmalade out of me, but not so badly that I'd want to awake my parents or anyone else. And then, quite suddenly, I GOT that closing shot, and the opening one, and a lot of everything in between.Haven't been quite the same since. I view 2001 to this day, and it remains the movie I've seen the most times in a theater, or in any other format. I quote lines from it at home and (quite fittingly) at the workplace. I draw and write to highbrow music. I may disagree with but still read Clarke (90 years old as of this writing, bless him) and other masters of his genre. And from that first-run viewing forward I started recognizing Stanley Kubrick's name and those of other directors.This isn't nostalgia. 2001 connected, transported, embedded itself, inspired, and resonated on so many levels. It continues to do so and always will. What more can anyone ask of the silver screen?A postscript on factual errors, continuity and goof-spotting: As Abe Lincoln said, people who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like. Instead, respect what got 2001 made in the first place. Its ending turned out a lot more collaborative than anticipated. We might've seen not apes but more humanoid proto-humans (though only from the waist up), a transparent or translucent monolith, Saturn instead of Jupiter, and a swarm of ETs, likely none of them satisfying. And if Doug Trumbull, one of the credited FX supervisors, had his way the lunar surface would've looked a great deal different and arguably more accurate.Fact is, when 2001 was in production and driven by a director with a passion for accuracy (to be charitable) we'd still had only a glimpse of Earth from orbit and the surface of other planets. Though we'd already seen grand ideas, actual spacefarers had nothing roomier than a first-generation Soyuz capsule. The only ET to date was a 'BEM' or 'bear' that wore makeup. The Bell System would last forever (and might yet). And in Space no one can blur your photographs (except perhaps yourself), so to this day meticulously rotoscoped cutouts of kit-bashed spacecraft models moving very slowly across a star field provided an accurate depiction of interplanetary travel. ('Why, you been there?' 'Close enough to hold my breath, friend.')I still doubt astronauts will hibernate or HAL 9000 will be entrusted with anything more complex than a chessboard anytime soon. But 2001 made us both dream and consider these very points and far more. The moral: Making a visionary masterpiece is hard work!",10,1,5,17 March 2008
A Clockwork Orange," As I Grow Old, Part 4
","I first viewed this as a college freshman. Folks Stateside may recall that upon premiere it had received an 'X' rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. My classmates' response was along the lines of, 'Not only did we read the book, it was assigned reading!' And though I suffered my share of shock and awe in my first viewing the impression that resonated long after was the occasional sound of the audience laughing...LOUDLY.Fast forward two score years...it's not grown easier to 'viddy'. The acting in most places is over-the-top, likely on purpose, and though the net effect is somewhat laden in the irony department...well, so's the source novel by Anthony Burgess...and some scenes still place me on the very edge of changing the channel.Its direction still sears and is ably supported by the production design and camera-work. Not only does Stanley Kubrick know his Ninth, he also knows his Rossini. Try to find (now) Wendy Carlos' complete electronic score.Kubrick's screenplay adaptation indisputably has Something To Say, and as long as that's not said in Nadsat minces no words. Don't like the ending? Read the final chapter in the novel's later edition. I look forward to someday reading and comparing Burgess' screenplay adaptation.But it took me nearly as long to connect Alex's lead close-up with his final one. Beyond brilliant.Kubrick made me view films I wouldn't have otherwise gone anywhere near. It's not his best but if you're new to his body of work I guarantee you will remember it first. He probably would've liked that very much.",8,0,2,18 June 2011
Eyes Wide Shut," Life Is But a (Waking) Dream
","And that is precisely Bill Harford's life, from the moment Marion kisses him at her father's deathbed to his opening a beer in his kitchen in the wee small hours before entering his bedroom and spotting the Venetian mask next to his sleeping wife Alice.Go ahead, try it: Remove all that transpires between these moments. Remove even the mask. Fill in with what you like, or leave it blank. A plot will remain, arguably coherent, likely not as visually arresting, driven or interesting, but unquestionably a context in which to try to understand the prelude and possible coda to a crisis in the relationship between married and child-rearing urban professionals. We know these people, even if they smoke pot and listen to Shostakovich.I've not since seen Tom Cruise so vulnerable or Nicole Kidman so quietly terrifying. Their off-screen relationship, during and after, has no bearing, for this is Stanley Kubrick's waking dream, from the torpor of everyday life in defense of the relentless pursuit of the fleeting and superficial, to the gradual surrender to a visceral, sensual, claustrophobic and candy-colored alternate reality, to eyes forced unwillingly wide open. And we are all made welcome to it, whether we want to or not and whether we like it or not.And when you suddenly awake from a vivid and intensely pleasurable dream, do you not consciously strive to revive, re-create and re-enter it? Bill Harford tries repeatedly.They don't make movies like this any more. I am convinced that for the most part they've stopped trying. Kubrick is doubtless judged by his more famous movies, but such is the true measure of his genius. No other film director convinced me to pay as much attention to what appeared on-screen or want one or more re-viewings to try to see what I'd missed. I wish he was still filming though full well realize I'd likely still await the final cut...I am also convinced Kubrick knew he was dying. The actors' lines are his own. Study his final ruminations on the species in this light. The man was no emotional recluse and could not have died alone.",8,6,11,27 April 2009
The Bridge on the River Kwai," As I Grow Old
","A longtime friend with a shared interest in movies lately asked me to identify films that I appreciate more with age.You can guess that gave me pause. I could think of only two. Bridge was one. The other appears among my IMDb user comments. I will likely think of and report more with time...The climax and martial music notwithstanding, as a younger viewer I thought Bridge interminable and Colonel Nicholson a caricature if not a loon outright. Now I feel I know him and some of the other lead characters better.Both he and Colonel Saito are duty-bound and presumably near the end of their respective service. They are consummate professionals. Yet in my view the true focus of either is not the bridge but each other.Nicholson either instinctively represses the opportunity or purposely chooses to not want to understand Saito. Either could be for any number of reasons. The film provides no clues beyond an occasional and unsettling crescendo in the musical score. And David Lean knows better than to tell us.For his part Saito comes to acknowledge and very nearly accept Nicholson, yet remains almost physically incapable of fully understanding him, not out of some cultural gap but with full realization that to do so is to lose face, which in his place is unthinkable.In the above context the performances of Alec Guinness and Hayakawa Sessue are magnificent, and they converge in the sunset view from the bridge.Though neither meets Major Warden, they all mirror each other. Warden too is duty-bound. The big difference is that his focus truly is the bridge. He ultimately attains his goal, and almost instantly recognizes what he has lost with that. Though an excellent actor Jack Hawkins never impressed me with a range of expressions...except here.Shears is the joker in the deck. Self-preservation is his focus, and that's eminently understandable though not necessarily out of sympathy. But at the end of his day he is arguably the most duty-bound of all. The key to the portrayal is William Holden's apparent effortlessness.Truly a screenful of superlatives, Bridge is not so much a film in which I see something new with each viewing as simply recognize more.",10,1,3,27 June 2009
WALL·E," Piiiiiiiiiixar Iiiiiiiiiin Spaaaaaaaaaace!!!
","I'll admit my primary motive for viewing this flick was to see what Pixar would do with a genre for which I'd thought it eminently suited from the get-go. In this regard I wasn't disappointed, and noted that 'live-action' was seamlessly integrated into the animation. I suspect Industrial Light and Magic had more than its customary input into the production.I'll also admit surprise at, of all things, the choice of music. One result was a spooky introduction, and even Peter Gabriel complemented the estimable end credit sequence. There's one piece of Thomas Newman's score I'll have to listen to again, involving, I would think, 'looped' guitars, and you don't hear that every day.The story is direct and for the most part unencumbered, and perhaps best regarded in two discrete parts. To run for as long with nothing more said than Ben Burtt's electronic warbling and Fred Willard's Presidential impression is a gutsy move. The overall action is not conducive to blinking.Face it, if you try to entertain everyone and Say Something in the same breath you'll walk a tightrope no matter the message or choice of delivery. 'The Art Of' book depicts what this flick could've been, and I think that would've sent audience members scurrying.But to those who think this a 'green' manifesto or propaganda, I suggest they read more science fiction, starting with Jonathan Swift and H. G. Wells. Or perhaps just read more.It's a fable, friends, plain and simple, and if the viewer recognizes anything, even him- or herself, for the briefest of moments, then--it all works.",7,0,3,6 July 2008
