Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Cannot get enough of that couple!! An absolute 10 in my book!
","I first saw this wonderful movie on Sunday, February 19,1989 in theaters as a twelve year old. I have once owned the movie on VHS and seen it...  Let me put it this way, I have worn the tape out so much that I had to get it on Laser Disc.  This movie is set in 1947 in L.A. and Toontown (the home of all beloved cartoon characters).  I'm sure that you have read the previous ones and know what this little gem is about, but I'll go ahead and give you a little bit of the story...  Eddie Valiant (private detective) hasn't had a case in YEARS...  Until R.K. Maroon (Roger's boss) gives him the task of taking pictures of his star's wife playing patty cake (literally) with Marvin Acme (owner of the company that gives Wile E. Coyote headaches). Eddie shows Roger the pictures, Roger gets fumed and leaves the office. The next day, Marvin Acme has been found murdered in his factory and the evidence points to Roger...  That's all I'm going to tell.  I'll let you find out for yourselves.  Jessica Rabbit, (Roger's Rabbit's wife) is a human toon WOMAN.  Maybe an odd couple, but they seriously love and adore each other.  I REALLY love this film and it will always be #1 in my heart.  I'm really saddened that there will be no more cartoons and movies of this beloved couple :( (that's why I went to see Honey, I Shrunk The Kids; Dick Tracy; and A Far Off Place!)  I was looking forward to new cartoons of Roger, Jessica and Baby Herman (and hopefully more appearances of Benny the Cab), but I guess I'll have to settle for what's already done.  It's a shame such a fresh idea has to be omitted slowly by time.  I think that the actors did a FANTASTIC JOB.  Who else can pull this off besides imaginative children?  GREAT IMAGINATIVE ACTORS!!  I have both books- Who Censored Roger Rabbit (loved it) and Who P-P-P-Plugged Roger Rabbit(some questions, but entertaining.)  I loved these characters so much that I am in the process of writing about them.  I won't share details!  Thanks Gary Wolf for bringing these 'Toons into my life!  I rate this movie ten golden carrots out of ten!!!  If you love this film, read the books!  Look for a new book from Gary Wolf (not Roger related) near Christmas of 2003 (hopefully).  The movie is 104 minutes and some content may not be very appropriate for the little ones. (I can't stand Bullwinkle{Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle live action and animated}- He seems to lack intelligence)  Space Jam's okay. It's just that rabbit habits die hard! That is all!",10,1,1,24 April 2002
