The Equalizer," They got this one extremely right.
","Wow just wow,what else can I say? Well to begin i have to say that Dezel hit this one right out of the park with his stellar performance and extremely well written out character.The movie starts out very simple,a black waking up every morning going to his simple job and and the end of everyday going to his favorite dinner to drink coffee and read a book. Seems normal right? Well the twists comes when he starts getting attached to a young female prostitute that eventually get in very big trouble with the Russian mafia.Mcoll who feels sorry for her decides to go and intervene,he goes to her boss and asks to buy her from them for 9800$ of course they laugh at him and send him away without the girl. From this point you can say that the movie begins,Mcoll gets angry and through the movie you get to see and very well motivated Denzel Washington playing at his best.To sum this one up I really do think that they nailed the movie with great acting from everyone side and a great plot that brought out the good and old Denzel that all grew to love.I highly recommend for everyone to see this movies and enjoy it just the was that i did,",10,0,7,20 December 2014
