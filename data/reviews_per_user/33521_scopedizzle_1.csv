Deepwater Horizon," Great movie and a chilling reminder.
","As someone who lives on the Mississippi Gulf Coast I can assure you that this movie is only a fraction of how terrifying this disaster actually was. The men on the Deep Water Horizon are incredibly lucky to be alive as this was possibly the most catastrophic event to the coast since Katrina in 05. To the movie point: The performances are good and believable. Everyone feels like a real person except the BP executives who seem to be slightly embellished in how 'evil' they seemed but then again I was not on the rig so who am I to say that's not exactly what they were like. The tone is controlled perfectly. This is one of those movies that knows what its about and has fantastic tonal control. It stays eerie and foreboding through the slow buildup because everyone knows whats going to happen so it wants to capitalize on those emotions from the audience as best it can. The actual disaster occurs around the last 45 minutes or so of the movie (out of its 1hr 45min run time) and is played out very well, and from what I can remember of the stories being told about the event, pretty accurate. Overall this movie is spot on with its tone, gripping, and overall incredibly sad and may leave you feeling pretty much the way we all felt about BP back in 2010.",8,1,2,22 December 2016
