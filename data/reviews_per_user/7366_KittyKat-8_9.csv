Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie is THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!
","I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Amidala is cooler than Leia, Qui-Gon cooler than the old guy Obi-Wan, ect. What I mean is, these characters are better than the originals. Some people didn't like the movie because they tried to make it more enjoyable for kids. Being a kid, I disagree. I like the movie BETTER than the originals for that reason! Anyway, my advice:If you are, even in the tiniest bit, a Star Wars fan, SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!! It's great for kids, too. Ya-hoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Null,0,0,26 June 1999
Mulan," Pretty good!
","I liked it! Sure, the music was a little weak, Mushu was annoying, and the character of Shang was kind of like a pretty boy, but other than that, it was a really cool movie. Disney's usual best!",Null,0,1,26 June 1999
Groundhog Day," Hilarious! I love this movie!
","Bill Murray is one of the funniest guys in the movies, and I think that this is his best! The best part is when That Ned guy tries to sell him insurance again and he socks him in the face! One of the best comedies of the decade! Yeah!",Null,0,0,26 June 1999
Hercules," OK for a children's movie
","When I saw Hercules I thought it was very cute-cute characters, funny lines said by some of the characters, nice songs with a lot of beat! The only problem is that is was cute-but not normal Disney flick standards. The animation looked more like Saturday morning comics drawings than drawings for an animated Disney movie. And some of the songs(not all, but some)-BLECH! It's a cute movie if you like humor(or James Woods), or are a kid who doesn't care the quality of the animation. 3 stars out of 5.",Null,0,1,26 June 1999
The Lion King," Disney's most fantastic movie ever!!
","I love this movie! The story is great, the characters are great, the soundtrack is great, the animation is great, what more can I say? The best Disney movie!!!",Null,0,0,26 June 1999
Tarzan," Pretty good for a Disney Movie but.......
","I have noticed that a lot of people have come on here and said that Tarzan is the greatest movie since Lion King or whatever but I don't think so. It was a pretty good movie, yes, with OK animation, cute characters, OK story. A couple of flaws, though: 1.The music was AWFUL! Every Disney movie has a song sung by the heroine, and this one didn't. I think they should have had more songs sung by the characters themselves and not just be background music. Oh, yeah, and Trashin' the Camp- it's not even a song! SUCKY! 2.The villians in Disney movies lately have been really weak. They need to make them more mean! OK, now about the characters: Jane:She was really spunky and cute, I really liked her. Tarzan:Ahhhh....kinda so-so. They could've made him better. Kala:My favorite gorilla character. Really sweet. Kerchak:Pretty good charactor but too mean! Clayton:Really stupid! Jane's father:OK, just kind of a background charactor, more like. Terk: Rosie O Donnell at her most annoying yet! The elephant: OK, they could've done better with this one, too.Thank you for spending the time to listen to my humble opinion.",Null,0,1,26 June 1999
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," This movie is so stupid it's funny!
","This movie is really stupid! My cousin LOVES it, and I don't understand why! What's so great about blood and vampires acting like they can kill anything cuz that's how they live? It was so gross I couldn't watch the whole thing.With 1 being the worst and 10 being the best, I give it a -5! Don't see this movie! Save yourself the aggravation and being disgusted! DON'T SEE IT!",Null,1,3,26 June 1999
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Criminally sick!
","What I found most disturbing about this movie is its almost cult-like popularity with some gen-X fans. I know one young woman who owns the video and watches it on a regular basis. (She's seen it dozen of times.) She says its additively fascinating to her, something like watching an execution. Is it any wonder that events like the shootings at Columbine High are routine when blood drinking, sadism and homo-eroticism comprise acceptable 'entertainment' for young people? It is frightening that in so many scenes the victim begs for mercy and is simply ignored, desensitizing the viewer to human suffering. The victim is not a person--he/she is 'dinner.' I found the scene where the young (naked) woman pleads for her life but is nevertheless turned over to a hungry vampire hoard particularly disturbing. The makers of this film should be jailed. Anyone who could create this sick stuff is truly deranged. What's next Anne? Filmed autopsies as entertainment? Secret films from the Nazi death camps? Animals being tortured to death?",Null,1,5,26 June 1999
Pocahontas," I loved it
","I don't know what it was. Maybe it was because it was the movie that came right after a fantastic movie, Lion King. Maybe it was because I had never heard of the story before. Maybe it was just because the TV and everything were constantly hyping it. Whatever the reason, I loved Pocahontas. I loved the music, story, charactors-everything! I got like a thousand Pocahontas products-tapes,songbooks,regular storybooks,games and lots more than that, even! It was a great movie because it showed that girls can achieve great things, that somebody you might not think can do something just might be able to. Great movie!(Just one note: A couple of the kissing scenes you should probably fast-forward through when you're watching it with little kids.)Anyway, all in all, great movie, I recommend it!",Null,0,1,26 June 1999
