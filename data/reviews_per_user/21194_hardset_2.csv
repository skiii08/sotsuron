Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," great start to the Star Wars Saga
","Ok, so it isn't perfect, but I can't help it, I loved it!  From the spectacular visual and audio effects to the interesting plot and performances.  After seeing the Phantom Menace I left the theater feeling satisfied and anticipating the release of episode 2 more then ever.  One major criticism I have is that the special effects should have been tamed down at the start of the movie.  The effects should have been very progressive and built up, this would have made the decline even more amazing.  Some critics have said Jar Jar Binks is one of the major down falls of the movie, I disagree.  He is such a minor character (yet not so minor if you pay attention to the plot) that he could never ruin a movie of such grand proportion.  Jar Jar is a good and humorous character, who although adds quite a bit of goofiness at times serves his purpose.  Perhaps we should learn to deal and cope with JarJar as the characters in the story do.  Very strong performances by Neeson and McGregor.  Portman also shows some very promising acting skills, I hope to see her in some future roles (she sure is cute =) ).  While on the other hand, Jake Lloyd could have used a little more coaching in his deliverance of certain lines which came out quite artificially.  We must take into consideration his young age and inexperience and we must also note that he looked the part and played certain scenes very well.  Speaking of scenes, the pod race and final sword fight scenes were awesome! My adrenaline was going full throttle as I rooted for the good guys and hoped for the best. So, as you can see I was certainly pleased with the production and I highly recommend you see the film as soon as possible. But let me point out that if you aren't a fan of the first Star Wars series that you will not like this one.",8,0,0,20 May 1999
12 Monkeys," An original movie that improves on every viewing.
","Suppose we could travel through time, It is certain that many people would jump at the chance to take such a trip.  Perhaps after viewing '12 monkeys' they would be forced to reconsider. When James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent out on a mission back in time to prevent a disastrous epidemic that will wipe out a large fraction of the human race, he quickly learns that the realities of time travel are anything but desirable.  This movie deals with many interesting aspects that appeal to me; time travel, animal preservation, insanity and epidemics. Not only does '12 monkeys' deal with topics of interest, it is presented amazingly well.  '12 monkeys' provides Great performances by the likes of Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe, a plot that will keep you guessing, and some very atmospheric background music.I especially like movies presented the way '12 monkeys' is, ones that feed the plot to us in fragments, and only achieve total unity when the film is complete, not unlike 'the Usual Suspects'.  Movies like this require numerous viewings to understand and appreciate the total feel and effect of the movie.  I find myself watching '12 Monkeys' often, and no other movie has been able to keep me coming back for more as often as Terry Gilliam's masterpiece.",9,0,0,28 January 1999
