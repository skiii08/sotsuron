The Blair Witch Project," Gimmicky
","Past the fact that the incessant profanity just about kills any feeling I might have for the desperate characters in 'The Blair Witch Project' (I side with the people who view it this way:  Three pottymouths disappear off the face of the earth and good riddance.), one of the elements of a good thriller for me will always be the resourcefulness of the people who populate the story.  The point of this movie is that somehow these three unfortunates fall under some kind of parapsychological spell that disorients them to such an extent that they lose their way out of a touchy situation.  It's like an updated Hansel-and-Gretel story without the woodsman to save the wanderers from the wicked witch.  The reason why I have a hard time going with the premise of 'Blair Witch' is that I cannot understand Heather's obsession with filming the event.  If I were bent on getting out of that blasted forest, I would not be carrying a camera around to film it.  I also would not be photographing an apology to my parents for putting myself in this desperate situation.  Frankly, I would be praying that God would get me out of that situation--and fast.  This is why I can't side with the people that find this movie haunting; the basic premise comes across as a gimmick--an intellectual conceit, and the potential power of it is lost on me.  The best thing I can say about this movie is that I expect the actress playing Heather to be a favorite for an Oscar nomination.  The legend and the history of the Blair Witch is a far more compelling story.  Catch the documentary on the SciFi channel.  I found it much scarier.",3,0,1,23 December 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Is South Park near Littleton?
","I don't trust people who ask questions like 'What's wrong with profanity?'  If there wasn't anything wrong with it, why the social proscriptions?  The truth is some of us know that it is; that restraint is the right road to take; and that movies like 'South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut' promote the idea that the best approach to take is the shortest one between your brain and your mouth.  It doesn't matter how childish or stupid or hateful the thought is; it has a right to be heard--and considering 'South Park's' popularity, a lot of people must feel this way, or else have never really thought about it seriously.Considering how many Emmies it won, I must be in the minority on not liking the TV series 'The Wonder Years,' but I always felt like the writers were always putting words into the mouths of babes that sounded more eloquent and sage than they should.  I think Trey Parker and Matt Stone do the same thing. They revel in the nastiness they force out of the mouths of Kyle and Cartman and Stan.  They may feel that profanity doesn't hurt anyone, but isn't the point of profanity that it be offensive?  That it is trying to revolt someone?  Trying to sully someone or their reputation?  Trying to outrage Mom and society and convention?The dishonest part about this is, whether they care to admit it or not, Parker and Stone like holding up Kyle and Cartman and Stan as moral beings.  We are getting the same nonsense about their forthrightness as we did when people were praising Bart Simpson for his irreverence and cynicism.  Even I'm willing to accept a good dose of this stuff, if it clears the air.  But if I'm to believe that a lot of kids talk like the ones on South Park, then the moral methane that rises from the confusion that a Terrence and Phillip create must to God make the world look like Gary, Indiana. Unless we or grace or both are constantly in touch with our children, they remain pre-moral imps like Cartman or Kyle, congratulating themselves on what little triumphs over vice they manage to eke out every so often.  This moral underachievement may not be a bad thing; but it's hardly a great thing either.  And the praise this movie is getting stumps me.  Profanity may not be as bad as, say, mowing down your classmates with a semiautomatic weapon, but the distance between the two is not exactly reason to stand up and cheer either.  South Park is in Colorado, right?  Is it anywhere near Littleton?",2,0,7,25 January 2000
That Thing You Do!," Hanks pulls out all the stops!
","Tom Hanks pulled out all the creative stops to put his picture 'That Thing You Do' together, and it shows--magnificently.  Audiences could confuse a movie with lightness of tone as unsubstantial, but serious subjects and heavyhandedness are not prerequisites for greatness. It's quite possible for a movie to be light and airy, or frivolous and charming, and still make a grand impression.  I won't stretch my point by saying 'That Thing You Do' is a great movie, but it's the kind of work that pools all the pleasures of moviegoing:  laughs, music, dreams of material success, passion, romance--and serves them up in generous measure. And finally, a role that allows Hanks to reveal the sharper, more creative, less lovable side of himself, that is to say, an adult--with ambition and focus and drive, a distant cousin of Tony Curtis' Sidney Falco.  Hanks takes on twin roles: publicity agent grooming a talented fledgling rock'n'roll band for stardom; and writer/director behind the camera orchestrating all the myriad ingredients that make this movie a rousing success.  He shows a sophisticated way with a wisecrack, and an equally mature facility for storytelling.And hats off to Hanks for the cast he assembles! As Lenny Haise, the lead guitarist of the band, Steve Zahn could not have not have made me laugh any harder.  Mr. White may think him a fool, but Zahn's Lenny takes his place among the best of fools; Shakespeare's Falstaff or Mozart's Papageno have nothing on him.  He's the restless mover of the narrative.  Without Lenny's impulsiveness, the band would not have made the leaps and bounds it did in so short a time, and every quick step of the way Zahn makes of it heady fun.The tomfoolery doesn't stop with Lenny.  Tom Everett Scott in the lead is forced into a kind of princely strait-jacket, but the actors on the sidelines like Holmes Osborne and Claudia Stedelin as Scott's parents; Kevin Pollak as Boss Vic Kosslovich, a two-bit impresario from Pittsburgh; and Alex Rocco as the blissfully crass Sol Siler leave us smiling long after the story has left them behind.  (When Rocco spits out something like 'And will someone get Fabian away from me?,' I almost fell off the couch, doubled over with laughter.)  Sort through this movie, and you'll find a gift at every turn.  It chimes in a variety of music styles, the best pop offerings coming from Adam Schlesinger (who wrote the title song), Scott Rogness, and Rick Elias with a good deal of the filler music being Hanks' collaborations.  It showcases some dazzling musical numbers--'Dance With Me Tonight' is the centerpiece.  It sends us visions of Liv Tyler, Charlize Theron, Rita Wilson, and Kennya J. Ramsey to mull over.  And it conjures up a time when America was still at peace with itself.  Need we ask for anything more?",10,0,0,18 January 2000
American Beauty," Shallow and overwrought
","Moviegoers must be suffering from some kind of pre-millennium fatalistic malaise to mistake 'American Beauty' for a work of depth.  Written by Alan Ball who produced CBS' 'Cybill,'  this movie shares with the sitcom that contempt for anything outside its own narrow sphere of values.  What's worse is this time around Ball tries to pass them off as universal.  Its basic pieties are embodied by one Lester Burnham (played way over the top by the sly Kevin Spacey), and we are asked to trust that his newfound 'freedom' (Burnham quits his thankless job of 14 years after blackmailing his employer for a year's salary and benefits.) is an example for his control-freak wife (Annette Bening in an embarrassingly overwrought performance) and maybe the rest of us anal-retentives in the audience to follow and quit wallowing in the worship of things and missing the point about the meaning of life. Question is did it ever occur to Ball that there are a lot of us out here who manage to experience the beauty that life has to offer, even when we still sit squirming over where we are going to make the next mortgage or car payment?  I don't expect a Hollywood insider like Ball has to worry about that, and Lester Burnham uses blackmail to avoid the money-grubbing trap that's caught the rest of us poor 9-to-5 lunkheads.  Is it any wonder that Burnham's daughter (Thora Birch) is mortified by her father's behavior? The movie languishes over his getting wistful over her underage confidante (Mena Suvari) so unabashedly, that the same queasy feeling you had when Woody Allen was eying Mariel Hemingway up and down in 'Manhattan' overtakes you all over again.Why was it necessary that Burnham declare himself spiritually dead, and, hence, poetic justice that someone complete the picture he has of himself? This is the same kind of morbid nonsense some of us had to sit through when Mike Figgis and Nicolas Cage were indulging themselves in 'Leaving Las Vegas.' Actually, I know why.  It's a way of gathering sympathy for the main character and having a made-up tragedy wake up the other characters who despise him to change their minds about him.  It's so obviously manipulative and such raging self-pity, I can't believe so many people are buying this stuff.This is a Dreamworks production which explains the supposedly happy male homosexual meighbors Jim and Jim, but they seem such a shallow depiction of suburban ideals that the goodwill feels like a backhanded compliment. They are just part of the problem that's burning Burnham's hambone.  And Chris Cooper whose performance could have been this movie's hallmark is thrown away for an ending that, if gays were really thinking about it, is not just a tired idea but a subtle insult.It's Wes Bentley's guarded but unflinching gaze that's the real beauty. It surpasses even Ball's video conception of those fleeting moments when life holds you spellbound by its serendipity.  Of course, it doesn't hurt to have Conrad Hall behind the lens.  The man who capitalized on what most of his peers threw out outdoes even the most fastidious of them with some of the most fluid yet controlled camerawork in a movie released last year. Still, as good as it is, it doesn't take away from the dilapidated yarn this movie is weaving.  The story actually diminishes some of the visuals; and he might have garnered an Oscar, but director Sam Mendes didn't notice that he needed to rethink some of the plot and character development and presentation. The camera movements do get a little monotonous.  The only thing that didn't need rethinking is the score by Thomas Newman and others which plinks and plunks a seductive chord as it carries us gingerly through the course of the movie.  It almost makes you forget that the bloom on 'American Beauty' has long fallen off the vine (The moment I noticed it was with Carolyn clipping roses as disinterestedly as Martha Stewart.) and that all you have to look forward to in it, if you reject the death wish lurking underneath it, is abject resignation to, as Lester might put it, our stupid little lives.",5,1,2,11 June 2000
