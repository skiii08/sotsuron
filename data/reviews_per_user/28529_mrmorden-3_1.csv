Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars, the Motion Picture
",Anyone who was over 12 in 1979 should recognize what's going on out there.  The devoted Star Wars fans are behaving just like the hard core Star Trek fans did when their first movie came out.  When the next installment or two come out ... if they're ever made and if they're not atrocious embarrassments like this one ... even the fans will admit TPM was the worst of the series and an awful film standing alone.  I've overheard strolling groups of fans mumbling to each other: 'this is *exactly* the film he *had* to make!'  It's deja vu all over again.  (Coincidence?  TPM is an anagram for TMP).,Null,0,1,22 May 1999
