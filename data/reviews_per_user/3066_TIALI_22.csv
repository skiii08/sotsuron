The Blair Witch Project," no Bang for my buck.
","the Blair Witch Project was funnier than it was scary...not funny in a cynical I've-seen-it-all-you-can't-scare-me way, but funny with funny characters and dialogue.  the movie lacked a payoff....I thought the actors did a great job, but it was a movie.....even if the claim that this is found footage of a missing film crew, someone had to edit it into a film.....it ended like I was to believe that I was watching raw footage that was found later......but I couldn't believe that....so I never felt any terror or even more than apprehension, waiting for something to go 'boo!'  so I left wanting more...",7,1,1,30 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force Ain't With It.
","How can I begin to express my dissatisfaction with this total waste of *everyone's* talent?!  You know the phrase, 'too many cooks'? well, this is the example you can use: it took 10,000 people to make this mess, and all Lucas seemed to get out of it is a 20 minute ad for his Pod racing games sandwiched between many really bad Ewok memories (meaning marketing, kids). And what is this Ani Skywalker immaculate conception ('there was no father')?  And these symbiotic aliens that give Jedi their power?  Why introduce this garbage into the mythology?  I'm sure I could go on longer--but not today.  Maybe you can buy me a drink and we'll trash it together.  Stick with the KFC/Taco Bell/Pizza Hut commercials which are infinitely more entertaining.",3,0,1,21 May 1999
Minority Report," a few brilliant moments, but mostly terrible
","spoiler alert...
many problems with the story: Rollo Tomassi.....when you get to the seemingly-bad-guy-who-turns-out-to-be-good and the evil guy who reveals himself; that moment is brilliant: 'I don't hear anything' is a magic moment, but the scene has been played so many times before, most notably in L.A. Confidential. And the 'precogs' are not considered human, but in the end, they are human, so one has to wonder what rights they had while they were kidnapped and held against their will at Precrime?????  Suddenly, at the end, they get freed, but how can you free someone who was at Precrime voluntarily????  What if they like predicting murder?  What if Florida wants to set up Precrime??? Are they still being held against their will in retirement? And wouldn't you think that if Anderton was a convicted murderer that they would *finally* erase his eyeball data from Precrime: how can his eyescan still give his wife access to Precrime after Anderton has been sought, caught and convicted of murder???Another problem with Minority Report is that the minority report plays no part in the story--you could argue that that red herring is useful, but I started to think about 'why should I care?' I found many ugly moments in the story (Tom escaping in the new-built Lexus; the rolling eyeballs) which ruined my enjoyment of the magical moments (like in the greenhouse). So I can't recommend this movie.",6,0,0,22 June 2002
Unbreakable," See it if you ever read Watchmen...
","this is an extremely slow-paced journey with a pretty good payoff...it suffers from 2 major flaws which are SPOILERS-- 1. the hero usually creates the villain, and 2. the villain should escape....that said, this is a good movie for comic book readers (who are not freaks) -- good for people who appreciate the battle of good and evil, but don't care if Weaselboy's costume changed from p.5 to p.8....if you ever read Watchmen, you should like this, if you read Batman through the 70's and 80's, you'll like it....but if you whined about problems with the X-Men movie, then stay home work on cracking that PS2 encryption...",7,0,0,25 November 2000
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," really the end?
","Jumping into this third act is kind of confusing for someone who hasn't seen the second part in the last month, but you get up to speed pretty fast. I like much of the added plot, with Davy Jones's locker, the new pirates, and especially, the multiple Jack Sparrow's. Don't be confused by the somewhat confusing intersecting plots; as far as I can tell, everything makes sense eventually. The only real problem I had with the story is with the final sea battle where many, many people are killed on screen. I remember that the second movie had lots of death at the end, but it didn't seem as real with the giant tentacles as it does in this finale. And for a movie that's supposed to have a romance at its core, the resulting union between Elizabeth and Will is a little sad because of the subsequent curse. Overall, I enjoyed this more than the second film, and as a trilogy, this is a very satisfying way to kill a weekend watching TV.",7,6,10,27 May 2007
Sleepy Hollow," someone should lose his head for this...
","I've always enjoyed Tim Burton's use of fantastic locations to create mood, and I appreciate how he uses more natural surroundings in 'Hollow' to create an unnatural world, but, no, no, no, no, no, no,....who wrote this piece of junk??!!  Did you really need Miranda Richardson to tell the entire plot and give the reason for why she killed everyone???  Were you too busy picking popcorn out of your molars to pay attention?  And did they need to blow up a windmill to keep my attention?  I was fascinated by Depp's performance, but this sudden need to throw in pointless pyrotechnics lost me.  The carriage chase scene seemed better suited to an 'Indiana Jones' ripoff, and what the hell was Lady Van Tassel doing showing up again at the end to gloat over her victory????  which only put her in the position to be defeated.....the plotting during the last 20 minutes of this movie went right into the toilet!  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone I like.....",5,1,2,21 November 1999
The Matrix Revolutions," so awful, I almost couldn't balance my checkbook
","Revolutions was so boring, I took out my checkbook and began to deduct my debits from my current balance using my pocket flashlight to see--but somehow this terrible film kept distracting my work with such amazingly bad dialogue and pointless fight sequences (Merv's club? 10 minutes of wasted time; the train station? none of this advanced the story at all) that I forgot to carry the one, twice.  How can I get my account in order when these characters keep talking about whether they believe Neo will succeed at whatever it is Neo is supposed to do that no one knows what it is including Neo??  So they talk and talk and no one wonders why there are no EMPs in Zion until a ship returns, and no one wonders how they're going to have enough ammunition to defeat the sentinels when it takes someone with a mortar and pestle 2-3 minutes to make one shell.  Wow, now I need to transfer money from savings to cover that last check.  I almost didn't catch that because it got really dark on screen with lots of rain and lots of Smith's; I hope Neo didn't get hurt because he needs to succeed at something or other, because so many people believe.  Oh, forgot to deduct the atm charge...",1,2,4,9 November 2003
The Village," It's a Cookbook!
","C'mon, you know twenty minutes in what the big twist is going to be or you're at least entertaining the thought...but that's not the point when it comes to enjoying this movie.  There are also several small surprises that are worth waiting for, but there are also a few idiotic moments that destroy the charm and the suspensful momentum.  M. Night Shyamalan has produced better writing, but he still has the talent to create multi-dimensional characters whose motivations are honest. So even if someone spills the surprise and tells you, 'Vader is Luke's father,' it shouldn't ruin your enjoyment.  This is not a great movie, but it offers a few great moments.",5,0,0,31 July 2004
Pitch Black," Movie can't live up to first 10 minutes.
","Pitch Black has one of the most exciting opening sequences I've seen in a long time.  And the plot is pretty interesting.  But the screenplay and especially the dialogue sag at each corner.  Snappy retorts lack snap: ironic demises lack irony...the movie just isn't very clever given that it has the potential to be a great Sci-fi flick. One strong point, I will admit: the characters are complex.  The handsome hero isn't, and the brave captain isn't either.  I liked that. Anyway, some people get stuck on a planet that has three suns and creatures that eat everything in (out of) sight when it finally gets dark, and coincidentally there's about to be a total eclipse when our characters show up.  And all the supplies run on solar power! What to do? Well, you won't really care who lives in the end, and you'll wish it was just a little scarier.  But it's okay.",6,0,0,18 February 2000
"I, Robot"," I, Liked It
","I found it easy to overlook the flaws in I, Robot.  Of course, there's no Consumer Reports in the future to evaluate the quality and reliability of robots, and there doesn't seem to any problem with the apparent monopoly US Robotics has on their production.  There doesn't seem to be any government oversight at all, as if the movie tells its story in a vacuum.  And what about a robot designed to perform menial tasks yet has the power to leap 30 feet effortlessly?  Who would design a slave with that capability?  So, I ignore these weaknesses and think about the mystery, the 'bread crumbs.' The story is interesting and the dialogue is smart and funny.  And the story has an honest sci-fi ending which speculates on the future of human-robot relations.",6,0,0,17 July 2004
Saw III," keeps you occupied enough to not notice its flaws
","there's enough going on to keep you entertained. the biggest problem is that much of the story seems to be back-story for the 2 previous films. I would have been confused if I thought about previous victims or Shawnee Smith's involvement in the murders, but as I said, the strength of the film is how it keeps you interested in what's happening to the characters now. since we have a terminally ill Jigsaw, we get to see how he's dealing with his illness; we also have the tests given to the latest victim(s). and as with any good puzzler like these, we shouldn't be able to guess how all the victims are related until the final piece is revealed. and this is why this movie succeeds. we have four characters to follow through their ordeals, we get several mini tortures to enjoy, and we are filled in on details from the previous films. under any level of analysis, these stories are silly, this recent film had me wondering whether Jigsaw buys tape recorders in bulk as he uses about 7 in this movie. I'm not sure if the Saw franchise has anything left to tell us, but it's fairly obvious that Jigsaw will be back again since he's been given a mini-reprieve from his terminal illness.",7,0,1,29 October 2006
I Am Legend," tremendously disappointing
","There are only a few ways you can mess up a plot with only one survivor of a mass-epidemic, and this movie manages ruin this simple plot. First, how does the last man on earth spend his day? In this story he drives around chasing deer, or some animals, for some reason that's never clear. If it's for food, his hunting skills are pretty poor. Next we need to learn how he copes with being alone. In this, we have the benefit of having Sam, his dog, accompany him. It's not wrong to say that each scene with Sam works, and that when she's gone, the movie falls apart. When we learn that there's an enemy that wants to kill the last man, we suddenly learn that the enemy is so vastly superior in hunting and fighting skills that we wonder how the last man survived for as long as he did. It's here that the whole movie reveals the truth that there really isn't any story that makes sense. We learn that there may be survivors in the north because the virus can't survive the cold, but instead of confirming this news with a simple experiment, the last man and scientist, ignores it. Then we find that the area around his home is booby-trapped for a final confrontation, and again, we have to wonder how his superior enemy never stumbled upon the gigantic spot lights lining the street. Or even how the last man on earth managed to run multiple generators within his home without dying from carbon monoxide poisoning. The problem is that it takes so long to get us to a point where we discover that there really isn't any story that it's hard to admit that I wasted my time. But that's what really happened. The last man on earth wasn't very entertaining company.",4,14,23,18 December 2007
Mulholland Drive," a movie about a movie about a movie about movies
","I've heard some opinions on whether Mulholland Dr. is a dream or something else--so I vote for something else.  Mulholland Drive is a movie which includes criticism about Hollywood and filmmaking.  Watch the movie and observe the various directing styles.  How does the story change when Betty reaches Los Angeles?  It looks like a bad movie like Showgirls.  But other times, MD is moody like an independent film, and sometimes it's weird with long wide lens shots and a floating camera like a David Lynch film: so is MD telling one story from the several different POVs?  Is it showing us how Hollywood might butcher something but how an independent filmmaker might shoot a story and how Lynch sees it, all running together in a linear plotline???  Like Rashomon, but without the obvious separation of storytellers---And it's a story about Hollywood and the business of filmmaking. Sometimes Hollywood looks like the Mob, and sometimes it's just business; Sometimes Betty is in our story, and sometimes she's in one of the other director's stories....and what about the key?  Is it blue because the French distributor of the film has a blue logo?  Is the commentary about how difficult it is to make a film woven into the story?  I'm only at the one hour mark on the DVD, but that's my view so far......should I even comment before the film is over?  Of course not, but Lynch didn't allow chapter stops in the DVD, so I'm stopping intentionally and giving my opinion before I even know what the whole story is....Mulholland Drive (to me) is a story given to us as if by three different directors: independent, Hollywood Big Budget, and Lynch, and it includes backstory commentary on how Hollywood bullies filmmakers......but again, I'm only at the 1:00:00 mark..........",7,0,1,15 May 2002
Mission: Impossible II," Boring, boring, boring....(did I say, 'boring'???)
","Hands up those who wished they suffered from narcolepsy when they sat through this???  I wish I had fallen asleep or had to run to the bathroom 8 times during this 2-hour bore-fest.  Does anything happen in this movie??? for those who need to know, this is the plot: Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is enlisted to recruit a thief (Newton) so she can get info from ex-boyfriend, ex-MI spy, turned deadly virus thief...let's see, Ethan climbs a mountain, a plane blows up, Ethan and thief fall in love, we watch a scientist explain how heroes need villains (the same video clip 3 times!!!!), there's a horse race, a van goes boom, then finally there's some action about 80 minutes into the movie.  Some might say, 'this movie rocks,' and yes, the soundtrack is very loud and the editing is tight, but the story is about ten minutes of plot with lots of endless NOTHING GOING ON for a long long time.  So stay away from this dog of summer, it bites (the big one).",2,0,0,29 May 2000
The Insider," lots of passionate conversation between a few guys over the phone
","some guys get into very heated conversations about secrets and the public and health insurance during this 2-hour movie, and, dammit, it's really interesting.  most of this movie is just people pleading with each other over something, but the actors have so much conviction they make what is basically an old news story very appealing....",8,0,0,19 November 1999
Toy Story 2," It'll give you a Woody!
","This movie raises many questions about the universe these toys inhabit....Woody is stolen because he's a valuable collectible and finds out that he's really a popular television star from the 1950's.  Because of this, I'm wondering who owned Woody before Andy did????  Andy's mom says Woody's been in the family a long time, but Woody doesn't have any memory of belonging to any one other than Andy......well, other than that, the movie is very funny and has more and better action than anything else I've seen in a long time.  The acting is even better: Joan Cusack is amazing (again!!!--she always is...).  Really, if you don't like this movie, you're a heartless, soulless, corpse.  I would give a 10, but but those earlier questions still haunt me...",9,0,1,26 November 1999
National Treasure," reminds us that our history is our treasure
","sure, it's a weak history lesson, but it's a boy's patriotic view of history. it's a boy scout's view, and a dying view in today's amoral America. National Treasure is basically a boy's treasure hunt movie, The Goonies with adults solving clues to claim an impossible prize. It never stoops to cheap laughs and only slaps on one car chase and one overblown explosion. It's a love story and an adventure and anyone who longs to feel the vicarious passion of an adventurer can do much worse than this. Nicolas Cage might not be the best actor to convey this passion, his boyish charm fading years ago, but he's sincere in his love for his country's rich history. The real stars here are the locations with Cage following ancient clues that lead him to Independence Hall and the Library of Congress. Americans have their own national treasure in their history and in the stories of the founding fathers, and National Treasure is the only movie in recent years that attempts to remind us of this.",7,0,0,21 November 2004
The Da Vinci Code," the dumbest story ever told
","So I asked my friends if they knew how many DNA samples it takes to discover the parents of a child and they each answered, 3. You need a mother, father and child so you can sample the DNA to see if they are related. So if this is true, why does the Da Vinci Code tell us that they can sample the DNA of a mother (Mary Magdeline) and a daughter (Sophie) to tell us if Sophie is the daughter of Jesus Christ? Who has a sample of Jesus's DNA? Now, this bothered me through much of the movie, since the whole plot relied on each secret group either protecting or trying to destroy the holy grail, meaning the daughter of Mary Magdeline and Jesus. Sure, Mary could have had a kid, lots of kids, but no one can prove who the father was. So the protection of Mary's body is pointless. Hence, the entire story is pointless. I don't understand anything that happened. I don't understand why a man who has been shot walks around a museum leaving clues at several locations then removes all his clothes before he dies; it seems like he could have made it to the hospital in that time. And why does the dying curator leave a secret message to a Harvard professor pointing to the Mona Lisa, but makes a point of including the name of the artist in the clue? Wouldn't the professor know who painted the Mona Lisa? Is the clue meant for the dumb reader/movie-goer who doesn't know who painted the Mona Lisa? This is an incredibly dumb story based on bad science/logic meant for dumb people who failed that subject in grade school.",3,3,8,20 May 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," so unnecessarily convoluted, it approaches genius
","The Matrix Reloaded has many flaws--flaws common to genre-crossing stories: what percentage of the movie should be action and what part should be narrative, or is there a way to combine the two.  The first Matrix was able to combine narrative and action, but Reloaded fails to make these aspects seamless....but it does surpass the first Matrix in sci-fi theology: what is free will, etc.....not a bad movie, but the fabric of the story is thin in the crotch...",6,0,0,18 May 2003
The Green Mile," When a mouse upstages Tom Hanks, something ain't right...
","This is an amazing waste of everyone's talent...you know the movie is going to be awful when it begins with an old man remembering something which changed his life, and you know it's really really awful, when the character he's remembering at says at the end of the tale, '...but there's something I don't understand...'  You know the old man is going to, with a twinkle in his eye, reveal the mystery that puts the twist on the whole story.....and it'll turn your stomach with it's preposterousness... Tom Hanks does a good job: he usually does (good ol' Tom) and the supporting cast is all equally good, but the story is so melodramatic and so emotionally contrived that the final effect is that I'm sure I won't remember a thing about this movie 5 minutes after I finish typing this...in fact I can't think of much about it now...what a blessing!!! Long story short, an innocent man is going to die and there's not enough tragedy in that; he needs to be a miracle worker, also.  But I don't care, and I'm pretty sure you won't, but it'll earn a heap of award nominations and as long as it doesn't win for writing, then I won't complain...much.",4,0,2,12 December 1999
The Matrix," Awesome special effects loaded kick-em-up Sci-fi flick
","Every good thing you hear about this movie is true.  The special effects are amazing and Keanu doesn't talk much.  Any bad thing you hear is just someone who just didn't get it.  The plot is simple: take one part Terminator, one part Total Recall and two parts any movie like Dark City or 12 Monkeys or that Star Trek episode where they fight at the O K Corral.  There are weaknesses in dialogue but not enough to be bothersome, but the story is good solid sci-fi.  What is the Matrix?  It's everywhere and everything--simply, it's a computer program, but really it's not that simple: watching the characters learn to understand that is two-thirds of the movie AND THAT'S NOT A BAD THING.  We watch them learn and what we learn about what's happened to their world in the mean time is interesting enough to keep your mind wondering where all this is going.  Another reason to go out and get a DVD player.....",8,0,0,4 April 1999
The Thin Red Line," Pretty to look at; impossible to watch
","I know I've seen worse movies than this, but I can't really remember when: lucky for me, I block them out..... When were the guys in this movie gonna shut up?  This is the most obvious anti-war movie ever.  And that's not good...according to Malick, nobody on either side of the Pacific wanted to be fighting.  When he shows us the G.I.s, they look shell-shocked, dogfaced, worn-out; the Japanese look malnourished, brain-damaged, psychotic, like patients from a mental ward. So who was firing the machine guns from the bunkers?  Malick never shows their faces as if the men in the bunkers are different from the men killed and captured.   And those unrelenting interior monologues!!!!  Won't these guys ever shut up??!!  Their speech was like poetry, but there was nothing poetic about it: it was like brick upon brick of ironic sameness.  Each character, in an effort to express individuality, to break free from the sameness of the platoon, ended up sounding like every other loser.  How the hell does Malick expect us to believe these guys won a war?  Maybe they didn't win....maybe nobody won....oh, my goodness.  War is Hell, and Sgt. Rock said it so much better with fewer words.",2,1,2,7 April 1999
