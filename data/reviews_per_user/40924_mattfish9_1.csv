The Ring," Unbelievably freaky with a unique cleverness
","I have to say that I wasn't expecting much from this film.  I think I was misled by the previews or just knew too little to have much expectations. The movie turns out to be remarkably fresh and clever in it's story telling. The cinematics are done so well and the themes are kept true throughout the film.  It's not a masterpiece in the acting department but Naomi Watts is turning out to be one to watch and the acting from David Dorman (the child) left chills running down my spine.  Everything from the soundtrack to the sound effects were all top notch.  I honestly don't think I've ever seen so many people jump from such simple, yet well-placed, well-timed sound effects.  As far as the plot of the movie goes, it's up there with some of the greats in the same genre (Sixth Sense, Dark City and Memento).  I actually enjoyed the entire story and believe that the producer of the film did an excellent job bringing it to the big screen.  I've been recommending this film to many of my family and friends for it's a fitting late October release.  If you enjoy thrillers even a little or are looking for something different from your typical slash-horror films, go see this film as soon as you can.",10,0,0,21 October 2002
