The Rock," Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery team up in this explosive, fun-filled action vehicle
","In an era of groundbreaking blockbuster action flicks, this film directed by Michael Bay, the master of over-the-top action sequences and excessive explosions galore, places Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage and Academy Award nominee Sean Connery in 136 minutes of frenetic gunfights, hand-to-hand combat, and loud explosions absorbing the screen. Unlike the 'Die Hard' franchise which was a cutting-edge to the action genre, this film is nothing groundbreaking nor does it try to beat. But with likable performances by our leads Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery, adrenaline-fueled action set pieces, and a blissful taste of light-heart humor; the film is quite a bit of fun. Although Michael Bay is not a director who carries interest is soaking his films with sheer intelligence, he still knows how to craft a motion picture with enough mayhem and humor to leave keep our eyes glued to the screen. And who scores a better position in the producer's chair than Hollywood veteran Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson. The film follows a story of Stanley Goodspeed (played by Nicolas Cage), a biochemist for the FBI who's called on a mission to bring down General Francis Hummel (played by Ed Harris) who along his fellow Marines has taken prisoners of Alcatraz Island hostage and set wipe out San Francisco with chemical missiles unless the FBI does one thing: pay him the $100,000 he demands for his military service. Fighting by Goodspeed's side Mason (played by Sean Connery), a prison escapee who assists him on his no-holds-bar mission to thwart Hummel's attack and save the citizens of San Francisco.Director Michael Bay doesn't offer anything out of the ordinary for an action film. Thus, there are no genuine surprises to handed beyond a heavy load of explosive gunfights and hand-to-hand combat sequences which make a good portion of the near 2 1/2 hour runtime. Luckily, Bay succeeds at landing excitement and plenty of fun to indulge all the action film junkies. Nearly every second gunfire and explosions fills the screen, there is plenty of pulse-pounding tension to be handed. However, as the film is Rated R, these sequences do get pretty bloody and there are a few minor characters who meet their ends in graphic way such as chemical burns. In the end, it is all for the sake for drenching moviegoers in sheer thrills. Taking on the lead roles is Nicolas Cage and 'James Bond' veteran Sean Connery to show off some decent chemistry between one another. Their characters sprout a fair share of humorous one-liners and clever banter, and the performances stand fairly strong. Though neither of them meet the qualities of Bruce Willis's John McClane, both of which are surprisingly likable. As for the main antagonist General Francis Hummel played by Ed Harris, he makes for a surprising villain a little beyond your one-dimensional evildoer. He's portrayed as a figure not out for trouble just for the sake of causing mindless mayhem, but simply because of his emotional scars dealing with experience in the Vietnam War and the government failing to honor him and his fellow the financial gratitude they deserve. In the final climax, viewers can almost sympathize with him.The Rock is an explosive action flick glossed with entertaining action sequences, charismatic characters, and a fair share of thrills to feast the eyes for moviegoers. To say the least, it's a bit of fun. Although it may fall short of originality and substance, it works well as an absorbing popcorn flick to entertain those not anxious for anything cutting-edge in the action genre.",8,2,2,9 February 2017
The Benchwarmers," A slapdash sports comedy where dimwitted fart jokes and slapstick humor triumphs over genuine laughs
","The Benchwarmers is about as dimwitted and sophomoric as you come to expect from a comedy produced by Adam Sandler. This movie marks yet another attempt by a comedic trio trying to garnish laughs through absent-minded humor ranging from fart jokes, to pee jokes, to seemingly nonstop slapstick gags that may have been funny when watching 'The Three Stooges' back in the 60s. Nowadays, those jokes just fall flat. Stepping the foot into the main roles are Rob Schneider and David Spade, allies of the Adam Sandler filmography, and Jon Heder, who gained popularity for his role in 'Napoleon Dynamite'. And if these actors prove anything here, it is that juvenile humor including jokes of the scatological category just aren't funny anymore, unless you are an elementary schooler where that humor is sadly still popular in that demographic. If there are any benefits raised from this slapdash comedic, it is that there are just a few laughs, but they come few and far in between. This film follows Gus (played by Rob Schneider), a man with a low-paying job and a wife named Liz (played by Molly Sims); not much else. After beating a group of kids who he witnesses bullying a poor little boy in a game of baseball, he and his friends Clark (played by Jon Heder), a paperboy, and Richie (played by David Spade), a video store clerk, form a baseball team and play in a tournament against Little League teams, and recruit a millionaire techno geek Mel (played by Jon Lovitz) as their coach. There are plenty of comedies with sports serving as the narrative core that manage to shower in some clever laughs and charm to invite moviegoers in for a good time. This movie is not one of them. The best time this film has to offer to shooting a few somewhat funny jokes once every fourth time the characters on the baseball field making fools out of themselves. The main problem is that these actors seem to have nothing better to do than to plunge deep into dull sophomore humor to the point where you feel like your brain cells slowly depleting as the movie goes on. It soon becomes a continuous and almost predictable streak of how many times Jon Heder's character bangs his head or whacks himself with the bat from just being plain silly. And for the lowest common denominator, several scenes of characters farting another character's face. Unless you are a child in elementary school, this comedic gimmick is just not funny. Arguably the actor who delivers the most laughs is Rob Schneider, and his delivery of goods come far and few in between. While this is not his worst role, it certainly isn't one to leave you cheering with laughter. The rest of the actors including Jon Heder and David Spade are given nothing valuable to work with other than to spit loads of obnoxious dialogue, while Nick Swardson is tasked with nothing but to act like a goofy man-child who has fear of being out in the sun each time he makes his way on screen. At the end, the story tries to win your heart by sporting a cheesy little message about the consequences of the bullying. It is a good one, but definitely not one many people haven't heard before. The Benchwarmers is a slapdash sports-themed comedy that suffers from an excess of dimwitted potty humor and dull slapstick gags. This film falls so short of comedic diamonds it willy likely to leave you checking the clock more often than investing your attention to the screen. If one were the edit out this movie and make an online clip consisting of the funny parts, they would be looking at around one minute. Now that is disappointing.",3,0,1,8 July 2017
Moneyball," Brilliant movie about why we love baseball
","Brad Pitt brings the best of his acting talent to this biopic drama about what everyone loves about baseball. Based on the true events as well as the non- fiction novel by Michael Lewis, director Bennett Miller and writer acclaimed writer Aaron Sorkin takes a stab a story of the complexities of the Major League Baseball association, and the odds that defied expectation during these events. Pitt plays Billy Beane, manager of the Oakland Athletes disillusioned by the loss of the New York Yankees in the 2001 postseason. With the help of Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill), an economics graduated from Yale, Beane recruits a team of undervalued players while coping with a tight budget. Rather than scouting, his method of recruitment involve choosing players based on home run scores and ability on base. Their unusual method of recruitment takes a challenge on the old-school traditions of baseball Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays Art Howe, Beane's manager who looks at his recruiting with disapproval.Many may have seen classic baseball flicks such Field of Dream (1989), A League of Their Own (1992), and The Sandlot (1993), but none of these come near as fascinating to this one. Brad Pitt demonstrates a top notch performance as Billy Beane, he definite kind of performance that demands for your attention. Looking back at the previous roles in his career, it is easy for some to cite this one as the best performance of his career. Then you have Jonah Hill, who is known for mostly comedic roles, takes on his first dramatic role and his performance is nothing short of magnificent. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is also given a share of spotlight, but not enough to make this a memorable role of him. This film is also beautifully written, the script is pretty sharp. Though it doesn't quite pack the punch that writer Aaron Sorkin conveyed in his previous, 'Social Network' for an example; there is plenty of heart and flair to be experienced. It tackles on some major issues dealing with baseball and it does with wit and intelligence. Unlike most baseball movies, this one doesn't directly focus on a team trying to make it the top of the scoreboard, and instead revolves around the business activity behind the park. Avoiding all the sports movie clichés, the plot follows how Billy Beane uses an unusual fashion for recruiting players, and it goes deeply how it affects the system. It teaches the audience the behind-the-scenes story of baseball that many may have never knew, and it does such an amazing job with it. It also demonstrates a clear image of what baseball is about and what goes on behind the stage. Yes, it has some funny moments, it has its dramatic moments, and there are other scenes that will have you lifted.Moneyball is one of 2011's best movies. This film is just so pleasing and so intriguing to watch. This would be very pleasing to baseball fanatics, as well viewers who enjoy the charismatic nature of Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Even if you are not much of a baseball fan, this one is definitely worth watching.",10,2,3,15 August 2015
Blade Runner 2049," Powerfully crafted and exhilarating in its visual scope, Blade Runner 2049 is a chord-striking achievement that is simply breathtaking
","Being a masterful influence in the science-fiction genre, it only comes to no surprise that a sequel to Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' would be subject to significantly high expectations. With Scott's availability restrained to the producing team, the studios manage to no one other than Denis Villenueve, the visionary behind 'Enemy', 'Prisoners', 'Sicario' and last year's 'Arrival', to fill in the director's role. Blooming with striking visual methodology and superb craftsmanship to capture the heart and soul of the 1982 original, the film powerfully exhibits why Villenueve was the right choice to take over for Scott. The French-Canadian filmmaker has proved himself as one of the cinema's most profound visual storytellers which only makes up half of the equation of why this continuation to its influential predecessor succeeds on making ends meet. It is a film that not only embraces the beauty of the original, but expands upon it in more ways than one. As the title states, the film is set thirty years after the events of the first film where we meet K (played by Ryan Gosling), a Los Angeles police detective tasked with eliminating the last remaining replicants who have evolved from the Tyrell Corporation which is now on its way to bankruptcy. Employed by his cutthroat boss Lieutenant Joshi (played by Robin Wright) who uncover a dark secret associated at the hands of a diabolical human creator named Niander Wallace (played by Jared Leto). This soon places him on a quest to find Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) who has been missing for decades. If you know Denis Villenueve, you know that he by no means lets his filmmaking talent go to waste. He squeezes out every inch of his talent and pours into this film, and the results take the spirit of its predecessor and spin it into cinematic gold. His greatest strength lies within his ability to take the futuristic city of Los Angeles and, with today's newly updated technology, turn into a roller coaster of eye-popping visual beauty. Downtown Los Angeles, dominated by holographic advertisements and neon light soaking the streets and skyscrapers, is just the beginning. As Ryan Gosling's K travels through war-torn landscapes and a wasteland clouded with tangerine-colored fog, Villenueve's visual grandiose is beautifully captured with master cinematographer Roger Deakins. Seizing the gritty atmosphere of his dark visual design, supplemented with the roaring electronic score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch, Deakins captures every frame with immense precision, and if his efforts are not enough to finally ring him his long-awaited Oscar, Lord so help me! The visual style greatly serves as a helping hand to the plot which follows the lead character on a quest that gladly avoids the common sequel clichÃ© of rehashing elements from the original and takes us on an all-new adventure, offering twists and cutting-edge thrills that define against average storytelling. And for a lengthy runtime pedaling just merely under three hours, this film knows how to keeps things moving without feeling the need to splash us with a bombastic actions sequence every five minutes but instead dedicating its time to constructing its characters and building upon its story arc. In the end, there is just enough justice done to compensate for its slow pacing that is likely to turn those who lack patience.Over the last several years, Ryan Gosling has proved worthy is tackling nearly any role he is placed into regardless of its genre. As for here, the Canadian actor is given the daunting task of carrying an enormous portion of the film on his shoulders, and the performance he gives as the lead character is simply satisfying. His chemistry with Cuban actress Ana De Armas, who plays his girlfriend, is nothing short of astonishing considering the highly original nature of her character. It is somewhat unlikely that Gosling will pitted with a role more challenging than this. Robin Wright stands strong in her role as does Jared Leto in his villainous role of a man lacking pupils in his eyes. As eerie as his appearance can be, Leto makes a decent impression of his character. Dave Batista, who shares very little screen time, puts in good effort for the short time he has on screen. And it should come to no surprise that Harrison Ford reprises his role as the veteran Rick Deckard, but his amount of screen time will definitely leave some surprised. Nonetheless, it does a solid job in his three-decade old role. Whether he makes a larger star than Ryan Gosling is somewhat debatable, but it is nonetheless satisfying to see the aging actor make his return to one of his most memorable roles. Blade Runner 2049 stands as a landmark in the realm of cinematic sequels, and with Denis Villenueve's astonishing craftsmanship and ability to embrace the soul of its predecessor, soars as a highly remarkable achievement in the science-fiction genre. With all the potential that lies within the picture, this film does not squander any of it and places it all on full display. Denis Villenueve, you're a winner!",10,2,11,24 October 2017
Black Swan," Darren Aronofsky's twisted tale is both gripping and uncompromising, and not without the genuine performance by Natalie Portman
","This Darren Aronofsky piece is a bleak and twisted tale focusing on the dark side of the world of ballerina, and far from ways you would to expect. It is an uncompromising character study of a woman who dreams to landing her dream role in a ballet are pushing to grueling limits, both psychological and physical. With Aronofsky's signature directing style operating the wheel, this film leans far from your average melodrama. There are shades of both horror and fantasy soaring through the atmosphere, drawing reminiscence of David Lynch. In this case, it is safe to classify this as a psychological thriller. How can a film about women dancing and prancing around in tutus slide into such bizarre territory? That is where Aronofsky's visual storytelling and gripping testament of psychological warfare come into play The director treats ballet as not just an art form, but as a blood sport with tragic consequences. The pinnacle of this dark, albeit intriguing tale is Natalie Portman who manages to shine high above nearly everything Aronofsky brings to life on screen. This film follows Nina Sayers (played by Natalie Portman), a New York City ballerina living with her overbearing and manipulative mother (played by Barbara Hershey). When Nina auditions for the role of the Black Swan for the musical 'Swan Lake', she manages to impress director Thomas Leroy (played by Vincent Cassel). However, he believes she lacks the sensuality for the role of Black Swan and instead hands her the role of White Swan, replacing an aging ballerina Beth Macintyre (played by Winona Ryder). Meanwhile, the role of the Black Swan handed over to newcomer Lily (played by Mila Kunis). As the premier of the musical approaches, Nina and Lily form a mysterious friendship that spirals into a twisted rivalry of both try desperately to outdo each other. Soon, Nina pushes herself to the point of losing her sanity. Darren Aronofsky's never holds back when portraying his sobering testament on how obsession to surpass one's quality can destroy both your inner and outer being. While he does have the tendency to take things over the top with his surreal imagery on just a few occasions, there is never a moment that feels squandered by any means. Opening up an electrifying ballet sequence shot by beautifully by Matthew Libatique, this film revolves around a character study of a woman who's psychological limits are tested by her obsession to land the role of her dreams, and does so by not just splashing us in the face of emotional resonance but presenting the action through a gripping methodology of visual storytelling. His inspiring methods allow for some dark twists and astounding surprises that leave us questioning what is real and what is not real. Is Nina living an unforgiving nightmare? Or is her obsession with competing against Lily driving her to the brink of mental insanity. Could it be both? Those are thoughts that keep us glued to our seats as we sit back to admire not only the absorbing atmosphere of the world of ballerina seemingly gone mad, but the captivating performances the cast brings to the table. Natalie Portman swallows up the role with tour-de-force versatility and complexity, a performance that allows her to expand her acting chops to astonishing boundaries. She simply grabs you by the heart and fails to let go. Vincent Cassel is genuine in his role as well, banking in sheer humanity and fortitude. It would also be a shame not to mention Mila Kunis's effort in her role. Each minute she and Portman are on screen, their chemistry is powerful, almost spellbinding -- especially in a shocking, yet erotic scene when the two engage in steamy sexual intercourse. There is a certain erotica behind their performances that keeps these actresses shining, not in a way to fulfill viewers' perverted desires but to pervade a sense of eeriness in their relationship. Although their friendship-turned- rivalry is a working hand at keeping the story on fire, it is Natalie Portman's Nina Sayers and her emotionally bleak deterioration into self-destructiveness that works the core of the film.Black Swan is a twisted, surreal, yet gripping psychological drama piece grounded by an uncompromising directorial methodology by Darren Aronofsky and performances by both Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis that simply demand for your attention. As this soars with Aronofsky's trademark style, this film will most certainly not please everyone. If you were uncomfortable by the relentlessly bleak imagery and material of Aronofsky's previous works, you may want to give this one a pass. Otherwise, come see what he has to offer here.",9,1,1,2 August 2017
Changeling," Clint Eastwood's overlong historical drama is dark, depressing, but deeply gripping in its roots
","This historical drama conducted by the force of Hollywood mogul Clint Eastwood is definitely not a pleasant experience. It is dark, emotionally taxing mystery that centers on the disappearance of a woman's son, every parent's worst nightmare. With a gripping execution and powerfully rooted storytelling, Eastwood pulls almost no punches when spearing the audience with a flooring emotional atmosphere. But above the bleak subject matter is a film that shines bright light of both the directing chops of Eastwood and the acting muscles of Angelina Jolie. While the film never ventures outside of any conventions of its genre or familiar subject material, it shows that Eastwood clearly knows how to handle a compelling story without slipping into the cracks of sentimental contrivances or flimsiness. Inspired by true events, this film is set in 1928 Los Angeles where switchboard operator Christine Collins (played by Angelina Jolie) resides as a single mother of a nine-year old boy named Walter (played by Gattlin Griffith). After a day of work, Christine comes home to find Walter nowhere to be found and reaches out to the LAPD on an investigation. After months of search, LAPD successful finds the child alive and well, and when starts off as cheery mother-son reunion quickly turns dour when the child does not appear to be hers. After adamant claims against the LAPD, particularly Reverend Gustac Briegleb (played by John Malkovich), that they found the wrong child, Christine is declared mentally delusional and is admitted into a mental facility, while Detective Lester Ybarra (played by Michael Kelly) sets out on an investigation that may lead whether Christine is telling the truth or not. Clint Eastwood proves to have the muscle to take on complex stories like these, and this true-story-based drama does a magnificent job at showing it. Eastwood brings a hefty hand at bringing this mystery story in life in ways that leave viewers guessing at nearly every turn. Is Christine Collins right about the child being not hers, or is she a woman overwhelmed with emotional trauma that not realizing she lost is right there in front of here? Only the few who are familiar with the story will know the outcome, but that is not to say that Eastwood fails to keep the events within the complex trajectory unpredictable. Eastwood takes on a daunting task of not only transitioning from the lead character's part of the story (including her time in the mental asylum), to the legal trajectory of the investigation that ensues from her uncertainty, but also balancing the film's two major subplots in an even fashion. One of which centers on Christine's battle of grief with the loss of her son, and her struggle against the law enforcement who refuse to buy into her mysterious claims. The other follows Michael Kelly's investigation on a child who seems to have an odd connection with Christine's son. This all comes down to a series of shocking twists and turns that not only contribute to the grim atmosphere, but sheds light on the ethical corruption of the law enforcement. There is no doubt that Eastwood does stumble on keeping things moving at very few spots, but it boasts a strong hand at balancing these stories with solid precision. The story is gripping, and occasionally holds no bars at tugging at the heart strings.Angelina Jolie has mostly made a name for herself in taking on action roles such as 'Wanted' and the 'Tomb Raider' series. This film however, allows her to exercise a dramatic heft that defies against expectations she is brought in previous roles. Jolie shows out with an uncompromising performance that sees the actress shining with humanity and gripping acting chops. Every she is on screen, it is hard not feel the emotional devastation she leaves swarming in the air. John Malkovich leaves a strong impression in the role of Gustav Briegleb, an LAPD officer who becomes the lead character's sidekick in the second half in the heat of the battle against the law enforcement. Gattlin Griffith, a young actor in his single digits, gives a pleasant performance for his young, nothing to the ordinary to speak of. Michael Kelly boasts a fair amount of grit and integrity of his role as Detective Lester Ybarra who goes on a grueling investigation that leads to results he may forget. The rest of cast whom are all suited in small supporting roles are credible as well. Pointing out an actor that stands out among the rest would be rather difficult task, even with Angelina Jolie in the roster. Changeling is a powerful historical drama that paints a strong picture of Clint Eastwood's directorial talent and storytelling skills, and the absorbing talent of Angelina Jolie. It is a gripping experience that grabs and rarely lets go. If there is anything that chews at the film's compelling narrative, it may the overlong 141- minute runtime which seems to drag on from time to time, and of course, the grimness of the atmosphere. Above all, there is plenty of talent to be admired in this picture.",8,2,3,12 May 2017
Alien 3," Generic and empty of the great shakes of the previous entries, this second sequel marks a significant step back in the franchise
","Ridley Scott showed a promising career as well as a promising future for the science-fiction genre when he unleashed 'Alien' in the 1979. James Cameron built upon his success with a successfully executed follow-up 'Aliens' seven years later, which established an effective action and horror hybrid in what could be considered one of the freshest extraterrestrial movies ever hit theaters. Both of these films fed good names to the science-fiction genre. So would it be reasonable for a third installment to follow firmly in the footsteps of its predecessors, if not changing the game for the franchise? Certainly. Sadly, that is not the story of this endeavor in the series. Plagued with many production issues involving overwhelming inference with Fox studios, the making of this film was a nightmare, a nightmare that only continues through this generic, soul-sucking addition to the franchise; with David Fincher placed in the director's chair. Lacking the flair and thrills of the previous entries, this movie settles for a dispiriting human vs. alien fiasco that never quite takes off. In an essence, the tagline 'three times the suspense, three times the danger, three times the terror' feels like a sham disguising the fresh idea gone terribly wrong. Following the events of 'Aliens', Sigourney Weaver once again returns as Ellen Ripley who crashes land in a distant wasteland where she is taken into a maximum security prison by Dr. Jonathan Clemens (played by Charles Dance). Trapped in a filthy facility by vicious convicts including Dillon (played by Charles S. Dutton), Golic (played by Paul McGann), Morse (played by Danny Web), along with many others, Ripley must once again confront against a terrifying extraterrestrial threat that begins terrorizing everyone. Whereas the first entry by Ridley Scott shined with a firm suspenseful atmosphere, the second installment by James Cameron prospered with a sweet blend of action and heart-pounding terror. This film flounders in both assets. While David Fincher nicely obtains the same striking chord-striking visual imagery that became a staple in the previous entries, this attempt on delivering the thrills and plot to satisfy come to perfunctory results. Following almost an hour of lackluster exposition, this film occasionally lets loose a few terrifying sequences involving characters being chased and gruesomely gobbled up the wretched alien creatures, but most of the scares and thrills in store are sadly ineffective and rarely come to close to leveling up the titillating thrills the previous two entries are notable for. Watching the prison convicts being chased down the halls through the alien's point of view may be little fun, but it certainly not scary. To add insult to injury, the plot not only falls short of interest but the characters are too dull or unappealing for us to care them even when there lives are at high stake. Even Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley seems to be worn out. While her performance remain stable for most of the duration, the rest of the cast is left drowning in a sea of one-dimensional character development, giving them almost nothing fresh to work with. If there is any other who manages to stand out close to Weaver, it is Charles S. Dutton as the convict Dillon. Then again, he lacks the charisma for a character viewers come to care about. However, there is another actor from the previous film that manages to make a brief return, and that is Lance Henrickson as Bishop who makes a brief appearance as a horribly dismembered android resurrected by Ripley - - now that idea is just silly. Alien 3 is a disappointing second sequel that marks a significant step back in the formerly powerful franchise. Even if there are few small surprises to be offered in the midst of the loud, gory alien chaos, this film fails to deliver much beyond a feeling of emptiness. That is not to say however that director David Fincher is a shameful director. After all, if it weren't for the studio inference and the constant rewrites of a script that was barely available during production, maybe this movie could have saw better sunshine.",4,0,2,23 May 2017
Captain Phillips," Fantastic, nail-biting biopic thriller puts you at the edge of your seat
","Paul Greengrass, a visionary filmmaker who rose to fame for giving birth the exhilarating Bourne trilogy has returned to the director's chair to tackle a much different story than a gun-totting CIA agent hunting down the bad guys.The picture is a re-imagining of the terrifying event that took place in the Indian Ocean in April 2009. That story was the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama by the hands of Somalian pirates. The victim of this startling event was Captain Richard Phillips who made a courageous, if questionable choice for putting his life on the line for the sake of his crew members. The inspiring event are greatly transpired by Greengrass who reprises his signature use of documentary-style filmmaking and top-notch direction to plunge viewers into the shoes of the titular character stranded in a terrifying situation, one that meant life or death. And Greengrass scores what transcends to a heart-pounding, survival experience without straying into the territory of extravagance. Tom Hanks plays the title character, who leads his crew on a voyage to Kenya, only have to his cargo ship, the MV Maersk Alabama hijacked by Somali pirates who take him and his crew hostage in exchange for money. The pirates are lead by the hard-edged Captain Muse (played by Barkhad Abdi) who along his petty crew then takes Captain Phillips hostage and threatens him in tension-fueled battle of wills with the no one to help him but the U.S Navy who arrive to the rescue. Paul Greengrass effectively crafts a gritty, nail-biting that's destined to lead viewers gripping at the edge of their seats, and the only aspect sugarcoating the terrifying true event maybe the PG-13 rating (there is one gruesome moment). Regardless of us knowing what the final outcome will be, it is a scary ride to sit through. Greengrass takes on the task of building up the atmosphere through the first twenty minutes while establishing the central character as a smart, humanized man who's unaware of the unspeakable terror that awaits him. From the opening minutes of the arrival of the Somali Pirates, the film quickly steers from a calm slowburner to a heart-pounding, tension-ridden powerhouse as Captain Phillips is unpleasantly pulled into a fateful battle of wills and sacrifice against the sadistic Captain Abduwali Muse. That is where a bold, uncompromising performance by Barkhad Abdi comes in, with his audacious line 'Look at me, I'm the captain now'. Abdi boasts a spectacular sense of menace in his role that bravely becomes a helping hand of the suspenseful atmosphere. With Phillips captured and incarcerated by the Somali pirates in a small boat for the majority of the second half, Barry Ackroyd successfully captures the claustrahpobia and the heat of the central character's conflict with documentary-style cinematography that's become a staple to Greengrass's filmography. As with Tom Hanks, he does an amazing job with capturing the humility and fear of his real-life inspired role, something many could expect from a two-time Oscar winner.Captain Phillips is a mesmerizing survival thriller crafted with diligence and substance by visionary director Paul Greengrass who knocks the ball out of the park. This is a tension-fueled ride with blistering suspense and uncompromising performances by Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi. To satisfying results, the film pays an inspiring tribute to the terrifying story.",9,0,2,17 May 2015
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Smart and pleasing coming-of-age tale
","The high school genre has faced many ups and downs over the past few decades, with some films delivering an honest depictions of what its like to be a teenager in high school while some have come off as cheesy, uninspiring sex comedies that barred from reality. Rarely has Hollywood managed to generate a film so deeply honest in it's portrayal of the understandably complicated world of high school and adolescent angst. That is where this charming dramedy based on Stephen Chbosky's 1999 coming-of-age novel comes in. With author Chbosky pulling off an exceptionally feat of directing the film based on his own literary source material, Perks of Being a Wallflower comes almost nothing short of triumph in it's emotional journey through the eyes of a young high school adolescent. This film follows Charlie (played by Logan Lerman), a lonely young man entering his freshman year of high school, and is stuck in his own lonely world facing the dark memories of his late aunt who was killed in a car accident. When he meets seniors Sam (played by Emma Watson) and Patrick (played by Ezra Miller), they take him under their wing to where he learns the meanings friendship, love, and hope through a series of ventures through high school including prom, midnight showings of 'Rocky Horror Picture Show', and experimenting with relationships. Though the year in which the story takes place is not specified; the prominent soundtracks by David Bowie, and absence of the characters' cellphone usage and other advanced technology suggest the early 1990s.Stephen Chbosky proves himself as a mastermind behind establishing an authentic world of teenagers navigating through the tribulations and uncertainties of high school. In the process of translating his novel to the silver screen, Chbosky abandons his epistolary style incorporated in the novel in favor of traditional storytelling, and by many he knows how it make it work. The film dives into a deep character study of the lead character, and takes on us on an emotional journey of him struggling to find his place in the seemingly hopeless world of high school. Though teen-oriented films have prominent to following a basic storyline like this its almost a cliché, this one exercises it a beautifully constructed manner that feels more inspiring. From there on, we come to know a wide range of interesting characters who each have face a problem of their own that many teens around the world can easily relate to. One of which is Ezra Miller's character Patrick who struggles with his relentless need to hide his homosexual relationship with Johnny Simmons, which is interesting enough to provoke some important discussions. As the story proceeds, Chbosky grants us with a truly emotional ride as it navigates through Charlie and his mental trauma that threatens his tear apart his inner beings, and his friends who deal with common adolescent tribulations like dating abuse. But at the same time, he brings a certain charm to the story that results in a blissful experience without coming off emotionally contrived. Don't get me wrong, there are also some funny moments sprinkled throughout to let audiences breath from its primarily mature subject matter. The cast serves as not only one of the biggest driving mechanisms of the film, but also the emotional core of the film. Lead character Charlie is granted with a thoughtful performance by Logan Lerman hits the ball out of the park with his genuine emotional resonance and pure honesty. Emma Watson, fresh out of her role as Hermonie in the highly successful 'Harry Potter' franchise, provides a reasonable amount of substance and emotion in the role of Sam who comes a close friend of Charlie in the midst of his loneliness. Ezra Miller is quite absorbing in his role of Sam's stepbrother Patrick who must contend with his homosexuality, a performance more relaxed than his sinister portrayal as the psychologically disturbed child in 'We Need To Talk About Kevin'. Mae Whitman also treats us with a nifty little performance as Mary Elizabeth, a preppy girl who unexpectedly gets involved in a complicated relationship with Charlie. One of the biggest surprises that comes to the table however, is Paul Rudd who established a sense of ingenuity as Charlie's English teacher who becomes a faithful guiding hand for him.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a smart and pleasing coming-of-age dramedy that boasts an astonishingly realistic portrayal of high school adolescents as well as some incredible performances by a team of inspiring young actors. This film is certainly not like many other teen-target flicks, its one that is brutally honest and profoundly easy for many teenagers to relate to.",9,0,1,12 July 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," Chilling, tension-filled spiritual successor to Cloverfield
","It was 2008 when Matt Reeves and producer J.J Abrams blow audiences away with their found-footage hit 'Cloverfield, a film that reignited the found footage genre. This year, first-time director Dan Trachtenburg brings us a supposed sequel that was kept a secret for quite some time before finally making its way on the media. Embracing on a solid technical scale and a gripping atmosphere, this spiritual successor formulates a whole new direction while concealing a relation with its predecessor. Instead of fostering a cast of characters fighting to survive against on a terrifying, large scale disaster orchestrated by a giant monster the size of Godzilla, this film sizes down on a trio of characters confined one single room. The film stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle, a young woman leaving her home to escape from an ill relationship with her boyfriend. On the road, Michelle is unexpectedly injured in a car accident and thrown off the road. She wakes up in an underground bunker sheltered by an old farm owner Howard (played by John Goodman) and his bearded colleague Emmett (played by John Gallagher Jr.) who vows to protect her from the widespread terror of what he believes is a doomsday event that lies in the outside world. Before too long, Howard's strange behavior leaves her questioning whether she is safe, or has just stepped foot in another bad situation.This film is not quite everything you may expect from watching the trailer. Unlike the first film, the found footage style is not used as this film takes place primarily inside the bunker. So the setting is designed to give viewers a genuine sense of claustrophobia, and it definitely suites the tone of the story. And with the decent cinematography, sound editing, and the typical J.J Abrams-style visuals setting the picture, viewers are blessed with some well crafted scenes from the start to end. The film progresses through plenty of scenes gleaming with powerful suspense and palpable tension that dares to leave viewers holding their breaths and leaning at the edge of their seats. These scenes embrace such a tense, heart-pounding atmosphere enough to keep viewers engaged with the characters and story. Nearly every scene is unpredictable. From near beginning to end, it becomes a terrifying showcase where you almost frequently have to remind yourself you're not one who is trapped in that confined space. While the pacing is slow at some spots, it builds up to its gripping climax at the end where the story's connection with its predecessor begins to shine a little light. Mary Elizabeth pulls off her role as the main character, but the biggest gem comes from John Goodman playing Howard, a performance so strong, if appropriately terriyfing it keeps the story moving. John Gallagher Jr. is pretty decent here as well. These actors excel at making their characters believable in every sense.10 Cloverfield Lane is a fantastic spiritual successor to 2008's Cloverfield, and probably one of the best suspense thrillers to be released in a while. This movie is very well shot with sweet cinematography, nicely directed for a first-time filmmaker, and brings grueling suspense to keep viewers at the edge of their seats. It should come to no surprise that there are some notable connections to the original Cloverfield, but I'm not gonna give them away. Overall, even if you haven't seen the 2008 film, this film is still worth an experience.",8,3,8,10 March 2016
The Finest Hours," Impressive special effects save this historical disaster flick from it's shortcomings
","From Walt Disney studios comes not children's movie based on a classic fairy tale or a classic source material the general Disney fanatic families have often been accustom to, but an intense wild ride of a biographical adventure illustrating the bravery and struggles of the U.S Coast Guard when they embarked on a treacherous journey to save a team of oil tankers who's ship faced demolition during the nasty winter storm that rolled through the Atlantic. This mission took place back in February 1952 during the Cold War era, and for many decades, has been called 'one of the greatest rescue missions in the history of the U.S Coast Guard'. Director Craig Gillipse, the man behind the remake of 'Fright Night' and 'Million Dollar Arm' offers an intense inside look in the events that took place that fateful day, but certainly not without a small of shortcomings in the narrative and overall direction. But in the end, the film makes an enormous ride that is more forgiving than flawed. The film opens up in 1951 when U.S Coast Guarder Bernie Webber (played by Chris Pine) meets the Miriam (played by Holliday Grainger), the girl of his dreams and starts a heart- warming relationship with. A few months pass by and Webber has proposed to marry Miriam, but is soon called back to the Coast Guard when a massive winter storm rolls through the Atlantic causing an oil ship SS Pendleton manned by Captain Ray Sybert (played by Casey Affleck) to split in half. With their ship sinking and Sybert and his crew in stranded in the midst of the powerful storm, Webber and his crew members Andrew Fitzgerald (played by Kyle Gallner), Erin Maske (played by John Maguro), and Seaman Richars Livesey (played by Ben Foster) are ordered by Commander Daniel Kloff (played by Eric Bana) to set out on their small boat through the stormy Altantic Ocean and save the crew of oil tankers.Sitting through this 116-minute disaster flick, it is quite easy to feel constantly reminiscent of 'The Perfect Storm' another disaster film based on the true story. From the terrifying storm sequences and the story of 'men versus nature', these films certainly feel awfully similar. This one however, goes for a more uplifting and less dark approach as it is Disney behind the development. That is not say that Disney hasn't been subject to a few somber projects however, as this film does center on a story that ended in tragedy as well as triumph; and it does a pleasant but flawed job of capturing the intensity of the fateful rescue mission. From the opening minutes of the violent winter storm, audiences are subject to terrifying sequences of Chris Pine and his crew as they battle through the fierce atrocities of the storm including 70-foot waves, and the fate of Casey Affleck and his crew as they are stranded abound the SS Pendleton that is less than a few hours from sinking to the bottom of the ocean. These scenes come to life through some dazzling special effects and impressive CGI, making for some nice and terrifying scenery; though it is a bit boggling how these characters manage to get soaked underwater during a winter storm and not show any signs of hypothermia. The special effects are the major appeal that save the film from it's writing occasionally messy writing. While the film succeeds in the level of intensity and emotional resonance, it more often than not tends to be all over the place in the narrative place, mainly as the main story centering on the rescue of the sinking SS Pendleton is constantly intertwined with a subplot of the main character's wife and the tumultuous relationship with the Coast Guard officers, as well as the struggle of Casey Affleck and his crew in the aftermath of their demolished ship. Compared to the main plot, this latter subplot is weakly executed and serves more as a distraction to the story. On the bright side, we are gladly provided with some great performances with a great cast including Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Holliday Grainger, John Maguro, and Ben Foster. Eric Bana also does a terrific job, though he tends to struggle his southern accent in a few scenes. The Finest Hours may not rise to the level of it's true ambitions, but it is a tense, uplifting disaster adventure that will please movie goers just enough surprises to distract from at least some its shortcomings. While this movie may not maintain the same quality status as 'The Perfect Storm' (which is somewhat underrated), it is at least worth a try but perhaps not for everyone.",6,1,2,14 September 2016
The Equalizer," Don't expect too much excitement
","To be honest, Denzel Washington showed off a brilliant performance and his character is pretty good. Everything on the other hand was pretty mediocre, the action scenes were a bit boring, the plot was tiresome, and there wasn't much excitement until the last twenty minutes. Chloe-Grace Moretz did an okay job but she doesn't offer much screen time as I was hoping. There were many scenes throughout that simply didn't make much sense which took away the film's entertainment.The action scenes were not terrible but I believe they could have been done much better. The main character (Denzel Washington) fights off some of the Russian gangsters near the beginning and the fight looked rather unrealistic, especially when he drives that corkscrew through the guy's jaw. The final fight scene at the end, however, was pretty good and was a good end to the climax.I recommend this film to anyone who is a Denzel Washington fan.",5,7,12,3 January 2015
War Dogs," True story-based comedy is only half as smart and funny as it should be
","Todd Phillips, the director and writer behind the successful 'Hangover' trilogy along with a string of less memorable comedies, is one of the last people you would expect to tackle on more serious subject matter like international arms dealing. Though Phillips doesn't abandon the comedic territory, this film marks a slightly different direction than his typical repertoire; a film that taps into the political satire of war, arms dealing, and the fateful consequences that ensue. The main problem with this however, is that Todd Phillips seems lost in balancing his translating of the inspiring true story and mix of raunchy and dark, cynical humor. By the end of its 114 minutes, it all transpires to a half-baked comedy that barely succeeds to generate good laughs while struggling to make a crucial point about the repercussions of international arms dealing.So this film follows the true story of David Packouz (played by Miles Teller) and Efraim Diveroli (played by Jonah Hill), two Miami natives who reunite as friends after many years of no see. Upon their reunion, David learns about Efraim making millions of dollars from illegally selling firearms online to the Afghan military during the height of the Iraq War. David reluctantly joins in on this and together these friends began making a fortune off of capitalizing on illegal arms sales under a fraudulent contract. In the process, they come face-to-face with some shady figures including an expert arms dealer Henry Girard (played by Bradley Cooper).Todd Phillips attempts to drive this rags-to-riches story in the same wheelhouse as last year's 'The Big Short' which tackled on the financial crisis of 2008 while incorporating an exhilarating mix of humor and potency. Adam McKay however, conducted his subject matter fairly more superior than Todd Phillips does with the true story about two unlikeliest of illegal gun runners. As exhibited in 'Lord of War' starring Nicolas Cage and Jared Leto, illegal arms dealing is a dangerous game; one wrong move is all it takes for everything go south. Phillips has the potential to flourishing a story of full of substance if not without some good laughs to provide a side of levity. Unfortunately, the film not only fails sketch out an effective political satire of its subject material but fails to dig deep into the politics behind international arms or the consequences behind the shady business. Phillips delivers a rather uninteresting approach the real-life tale in a way that deprives from the dynamics of the arms dealing industry including the political controversy triggered by the government spending millions of dollars on fraudulent contracts since 2003 when the U.S launched an invasion in Iraq. Beyond a pinch of social commentary on the Bush Administration and the established greed and corruption of the lead characters, the film barely reaches any dynamic heights.For a film dealing with the corruption and ill morality of arms business, Todd Phillips at least does a fine job on establishing a comedic field along with the chemistry between leads Miles Teller and Jonah Hill. Though a good portion of the jokes are bit hit-and-miss and their level of humor never elevates to the standards of the typical Todd Phillips fare, these likable leads foster almost enough laughs to make up for its faulty script. In comparison to the 'Wolfpack' in the 'Hangover' trilogy, the characters do not indulge in the same type of raunchy R-rated vulgarity, largely in favor for a slightly more cynical tale than an average comedic farce. Miles Teller, as charismatic as an actor he is, boasts a likable portrayal of the reluctant David Packouz who gets involved with his buddy Emrail Diveroli's immoral schemes. Diveroli himself is granted by a fine comedic performance by the ever-charming Jonah Hill who bears a solid barrage of bold-mouth vulgar one-liners and political bashing commentary against the Iraq War. Cuban actress Ana De Armas delivers a fine portrayal as David's worried wife who grows hungry for info on the nasty schemes her husband getting involved in, but perhaps isn't given a whole to do, nor is the 'Hangover' star Bradley Cooper as the shady arms dealer who the duo must face when they make an ill-adviced contract deal.War Dogs is a middling rags-to-riches comedy that may generate some laughs to please moviegoers pursuing for an engaging comedic experience, but suffers from Todd Phillips's trite execution on its true story-inspired. Though this film definitely does make for a pain-no-gain experience, the overall results fail to measure up to anything memorable or even clever.",5,1,2,13 December 2016
Skyfall," Skyfall is madly entertaining
","Daniel Craig makes his return as the iconic action hero James Bond in this compelling installment directed by Sam Mendes this time around. James Bond is assigned on a mission in which quickly goes wrong when he is shot down and wounded. Things eventually get worst when MIG is attacked by terrorists lead by computer hacker Raoul Silva (played by Javier Bardem who's intent on killing M (played by Judi Dench) who he once knew before she betrayed him. With MI6 occupied and M's leadership becoming questionable, Agent Bond seeks through the shadows to find help from field agent Eve Moneypenny (played by Naomie Harris) to hunt down Silva and take him down once and for all. Complete with electrifying action sequences, astounding plot, and phenomenal James Bond material, Skyfall stands what maybe the James Bond flick yet.This movie was a tense thrill ride from start to finish, and the opening action scene taking place on the high speed train really sets the tone of the film. The action scenes serve astoundingly well in this film, and this greatly done by the solid cinematography by Roger Deakins; definitely something Oscar-worthy. When the action lets down, viewers are introduced to some interesting characters including the main villain Raoul Silva who's sinister identity is fueled by a strong performance by Javier Bardem who made an impressive portrayal as a villain in Joel and Ethan Coen's 'No Country for Old Men' in 2007. Then there is the main protagonist James Bond who remains as charismatic and enthralling as ever, and Daniel Craig's performance certainly gives credit for this. The film also presents some eye-catchy action set pieces, one of which is set on Hashima Island, an uninhabited island south of Nagasaki, Japan, where buildings are rusty and completely rundown in a war-torn like setting. Skyfall is a highly entertaining action film and definitely deserves the praise it gets. This film shows that Daniel Craig still has the James Bond energy in him and is a perfect fit for the iconic British spy. All in all, Skyfall is a must-watch.",9,3,8,1 December 2015
Deepwater Horizon," Deepwater Horizon boasts an authentic and terrifying disaster into a gripping action-heavy vehicle
","There's only a handful of filmmakers who manage to tap into real-life events and adapting them to the silver screen in a way that effectively balances sheer authenticity and gripping emotional heft. Peter Berg is certainly one of them, and his treatment on the war genre in his previous film 'Lone Survivor' supplies fair evidence. This action-heavy disaster tale focusing on the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that occurred in April 20, 2010, spilling hundreds of millions of oil into the Gulf of Mexico; shows Berg further expanding on his ambitious gift on springing terrifying events to life in a way that not only shines diligently with realism, but also pays a respectful tribute to the men and women who either suffered or lost their lives in this tragedy. And Berg does so without feeling the need to regurgitate on tired disaster clichés and contrived sentimentality. Collaborating with Peter Berg for the second time, Mark Wahlberg plays Mike Williams, a father and husband who takes a four-week job at the oil rig forty miles off the coast of New Orleans. Set with a crew of 120 men including operations supervisor Jimmy Harrell (played by Kurt Russell) and BP executive Donald Vidrine (played by John Malkovich) who Mike warns about the various machinery issues that could put the employees in danger. Unfortunately, he ignores these problems. When the BP executives test out the oil pipes, they witness an alarming increase in the oil pressure that within moments, causes violent explosion that not only severely injures several crew members including Mike and Jimmy, but sends the entire oil rig engulfed in flames and the large crew in a harrowing escape for their lives as the U.S coast guard journeys across sea for help.Terrifying is barely enough to describe the heart-pounding intensity and realism Peter Berg captures in this disaster thriller, and how efficiently he is on capturing characters you come to care about with more than the single reason being the fact of they are inspired by real-life figures who had suffered this horror. During the first thirty minutes, the film spends its time introducing the characters and who they are, along with systemically explaining the components of the oil rig; this includes tapping into Mike Williams and his relationship with his wife (played by Kate Hudson, Kurt Russell's step-daughter) and his young daughter who passionately admires him. This also involves establishing the carelessness of John Malkovich's character, a BP executive who basically made to be the villain of the whole situation when he ignores all the warning signs that eventually lead to the nefarious catastrophe. The rest of fellow oil workers are left with virtually no character development, which is almost predictable considering the large number of characters we're force to swallow. Above this minor flaw, Peter Berg does a magnificent job on the setting up for the the prolonged disaster sequence in which we are treated with some of the most anguishing moments ever brought to screen in the disaster category; with very infrequent opportunities to breath. Machines exploding, metal flying, oil splattering, and bodies tossed around and about; there is absolutely no sugar-coating in Peter Berg's depiction of the hellish disaster. If you can the remember the anguishing cliff dive scene from 'Lone Survivor', that is close to what the disaster here feels like. With gruesome imagery of the character's injuries including Kurt Russell's disfigured face and the immersive cinematography by Enrique Chediak to capture the atmosphere of the brutal inferno, the film effectively pulls you into the heat of the character's fight for survival, and does so without igniting into Michael Bay-style mayhem but instead treating the explosive catastrophe in substance. Each time a character is battered or thrown thrashed, the pain hits you hard. And though Peter Berg inserts a fair share of sentimentality in the heat of the moments, especially at the end; it all feels real and never contrived. The performances, while nothing particurily special, also bring the things of beauty; primarily Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell who don't necessarily steal the show, but stand out amongst the cast in this powerfully executed action thriller. John Malkovich gets his fair share of ingenuity, but perhaps not the level of his main co-stars.Deepwater Horizon is an authentic and terrifying disaster flick on the account of America's worst environmental disaster in history. Peter Berg successfully captures the sheer realism of the horrifying events and effective technical aspects, while offering some gripping performances by the cast.",9,0,1,9 October 2016
United 93," Paul Greengrass's portrayal of the 9/11 attacks is a harrowing experience, but one that is impossible to forget
","September 11, 2001 marks one of the darkest days in American history. Helming a cinematic project inspired by the horrifying day is never an easy task. As thousands of lives along the Twin Towers were lost that day, it's no surprise that many people are simply not ready to relive such a tragic event; some may never be ready. Families were broken and our nation was left shaken to the core. How long will it be before a Hollywood retelling would be appropriate for the big screen. Nonetheless, it is an important story that needs to be told, and it is all done at the hands of director Paul Greengrass. While this doesn't mark the first time Greengrass as brought a tragic real-life event to the silver screen, as one of his past projects 'Bloody Sunday' centered on 1972 Irish Civil Rights protests, is a difficult to believe that the man behind the 'Bourne' films to be he right choice for showcasing the 9/11 attacks. To a stunning surprise, Greengrass establishes an unflinchingly realistic documentary-style retelling of the harrowing events both inside and outside Flight 93, slapping you with the sense that will make you constantly remind yourself that you are not trapped inside the plane in the midst of the chaos. It is a picture destined to leave you haunted long after the end credits roll. Told in real- time, this film centers on the events following the hijacking inside the Flight 93 by the hands of terrorists of Al-Queda, and the passengers that were taking hostage in the heat of the moment. The film alternates back-and-forth between the grisly chaos inside the plane, to the response of the FAA headquarters, to the crew of various air control centers fighting to acquire a signal of everything that is going on as the Twin Towers and the Pentagon are imminently destroyed by three other planes joining in the devastating attack. It is impossible to accurately confirm an actual representation of what happened on Flight 93. After all, nobody survived to tell the story. But Paul Greengrass's portrayal of the tragic events are about as accurate as a Hollywood director can get. Regardless, everyone who remembers or is even familiar with the event can predict the outcome, and it is far from a happy one. Told in real- time accounts, the first thirty minutes are very procedural, exhibiting the passengers who we never get know board the plane including four other passengers who later reveal to be the terrorists, and the day-to-day life of the air control crew and the members of the FAA headquarters preparing of what was supposed to be a day like every other. Greengrass puts no effort into character development nor does he dispense politics into the mix. But the question is, is it necessary? No, because these were people no one outside of their family got to know. Instead, Greengrass establish each individual as an average person going on with his or her life, and Greengrass avoid distractions by not casting widely known actors in the roles. This method does nothing to stop our heart aching for the anticipated events. When the first hijacking, which takes offscreen in another airplane, starts, that is when all comfort is gone. The film showcases the shock and stress of the FAA headquarters and the air control crew as they must cope with the hopeless events including the destruction of the Twin Towers which are momentarily shown on television images with millions watching. If there is even a single moment of levity, that is when the head of the FAA calls to shut down international air travel. When focusing on the terror attacks inside Flight 93 marks the most harrowing segments. With tear-stricken passengers held hostage and tortured heartlessly, Greengrass decently avoids slipping into exploitation territory or drenching the events with sentimental manipulation. Using his signature documentary-style cinematography, he authenticity captures not only the stress and confusion of the passengers, but the claustrophobia of the confined space. His methodology results in tension that effectively builds up to a punishingly devastating finale. The second that credits start rolling, there is no doubt many will be left emotionally drained.United 93 is an emotionally devastating experience that no only respectfully honors the victims of the tragic day, but offers audiences are an unforgettable understanding of what happened that day and heroes who sacrificed their lives to foil a plot that threatened the very existence of our nation's capitol. It is definitely not an easy film to sit through, but it is an important one to say the least.",10,0,0,4 July 2017
Deja Vu," Blending solid science-fiction action with pulse-pounding mystery, Deja Vu is a competently crafted ride
","'Wait a minute, have I seen this before?', a question that appropriately suites the overarching theme of this flashy mystery picture. This science-fiction action thriller, directed by Tony Scott, capitalizes on compelling concepts involving time travel, a sci-fi element with a constantly fluctuating reputation throughout most of the history of cinema. If there is any detriments to Scott's direction dealing with time travel, it is that he doesn't offer anything particularly new or original. Fortunately, that doesn't stop this film from being the entertaining tale of mystery and techno-compulsion. The title describes a phenomenon in which someone meets someone or faces a situation they believe they have encountered regardless of whether he or she has or not. This concept serves the centric theme of the story which places Denzel Washington in the lead role as a man seeking for justice against a heinous crime. In a solid conclusion, Tony Scott proves he is capable of tackling the concept with precision, if without inventiveness. This film follows Doug Carlin (played by Denzel Washington), an ATF agent who is assigned to a case involving a bomb explosion that takes the lives of 500 innocent people on a ferry in New Orleans. Boasting incredible detective skills, Carlin is invited by Agent Pryzwarra (played by Val Kilmer) to join the surveillance team who are responsible of using high-tech surveillance technology that allows him to travel back in time four days prior to the bombing. So Carlin must hunt down the man responsible in attempt to stop the disaster, while pursuing after Claire (played by Paula Patton), a woman the terrorist is hunting down to kill. Arguably one of Tony Scott's biggest achievements in this picture is effectively tackling the use of time travel in the way that avoids the common dilemma overcomplicating the narrative. Scott proves he is more than capable of telling a solid story without slipping into the cracks of irrationality or dullness. That is not to say that the film doesn't fail to offer anything inventive. Easily the film's sharpest detriment is its execution never stands out among other and more superior films that tackled the concept. On the bright side, Scott does not fail to bring on the thrills once the plot finally kicks into gear. The first half-hour focuses on the lead character and the team establishing an investigation on the terrorist responsible for the bombing, while introducing their groundbreaking technology that allows them to seek answers with powerful ability. This entire segment is driven with pulse-pounding mystery that opens doors for a suspenseful atmosphere. When the action, consisting of car chases through a moderately congested highway and gun shootouts that end in explosive chaos, arrives, the thrills begin to fly. Shot with slick cinematography, Scott captures the intense heat of the action with effectiveness, particularly the jarring opening explosion sequence, and the results are solid. As for Denzel Washington, this actor, who has reunited with Scott after 'Crimson Tide', plays the lead role with versatility and grit. Washington leads a supporting cast of Val Kilmer, Paula Patton, Kim Caviezel, Adam Goldberg, and Bruce Greenword -- all of whom are given only little time to show off their acting chops. However, none of them giving anything that allows them to standout among one another. Deja Vu is a slick, entertaining science-action thrill ride blossomed by the hands of director Tony Scott. Blending solid action set pieces with pulse-pounding mystery, this film offers a decently crafted rendition on time travel for those hungry for some adrenaline-fueled action and creativity. But do not go in expecting anything groundbreaking.",7,0,0,11 July 2017
It," Modern adaptation of Stephen King's legendary tale of horror tightly grips audiences for a terrifying experience
","It was 1990 when Stephen King's killer clown jumped from the pages of his acclaimed novel and made his debut in the celluloid with the hit mini-series 'It'. The chilling scare factor that made the series a hit, however, has slowly diminished over the past many years by its outdated effects and horribly aged scares. That is why it is up to director Andy Muschietti, the man responsible for 'Mama', to honor the nostalgia of the killer clown we all know as Pennywise with this contemporary adaptation of King's acclaimed source material. Crafted with an absorbing blend of spine-chilling scares and shocking emotional touch while defying against cookie-cutter clichés, this film straps audiences in for a genuinely terrifying experience. With director Muschietti taking on the source material with a grimmer and more psychological approach, the final product is an absorbing taste of effective scares mixed with solid characterization and an emotionally stimulating many horror films tend to neglect. Set in 1989 in town of Derry, the film focuses on a group of bullied middle-school children consisting of Bill (played by Jaeden Lieberher), Richie (played by Finn Wolfhard), Eddie (played by Jack Dylan Grazer), Beverly (played by Sophia Lillis), Ben (played by Jeremy Ray Taylor), Stanley (played by Wyatt Oleff), and later joined by Mike (played by Chosen Jacobs); as they scout through their town in search of Bill's younger brother Georgie who has mysteriously disappeared. The kids soon find their lives spinning dangerously out of control when they are haunted by the devious little clown Pennywise (played by Bill Skarsgard) who threatens their very existences. He's mean, he's scary, and he has a rude thirst for flesh and blood that makes him everyone's worst nightmare. For kids, teens, and even adults with a fear of clowns, the eponymous clown operates as an uproaring force that dares to leave viewers squirming in their seats. This is purely demonstrated in the opening scene when a little boy loses his paper boat in the gutter, only to be paid an unwelcoming visit by the devious clown. The atmosphere warmly lets up from there, but only temporarily and the majority of that time swaying away from the scare tactics is dedicated to setting up the characters, establishing their backgrounds and chemistry with each other that captures the innocence of childhood. The strongest element of character development comes from Jaeden Lieberher's Bill, a young boy who scarred the disappearance of his little brother and constantly defies against the possibility that he may be dead. It is an element is that is handled with subtly and pays off with an emotionally powerful resonance during the final sequence. The film carries an ambition in the character department that allows us to grow an emotional attachment for the children when the story eventually strolls into a spine-chilling scare-fest once the youngsters are forced to confront against the terrifying monster of a clown. Each scene the sinister clown storms on screen roars with a palpable sense of terror that pierces the heart as the vulnerability of the kids is heavily amped up with psychological thrills and jump scares that work almost consistently. And the hair-raising performance by Bill Skarsgard is partly to thank for this, channeling a sinister demeanor that manages excel above what Tim Curry showcased in the 1990 mini-series. As for the kids, they are all do pretty fine job never letting their talents go to waste. Whether they are cracking funny (and vulgar) one-liners like many kids do when their parents are not around or screaming their hearts out at the terror that lurks them, these children show they have what it takes to let themselves shine. 'It' is a profoundly terrifying experience that respectfully honors Stephen King's source material. Among many of Hollywood's attempts at translating King's works to the big screen, this one genuinely stands out among many. It is an entertaining and carries a strong muscle for splashes moviegoers with a powerfully effective horror experience that really works.",9,2,5,6 October 2017
If I Stay," Very emotional and touching at times, but somewhat forgettable
","Based on the novel by Gayle Forman, If I Stay follows 17-year old Mia Hall (played by Chloe Grace Moretz), a violin prodigy who falls for a handsome guy named Adam (played by Jamie Blackely). Their relationship seemingly goes smooth while facing some occasional ups and downs. This is until one afternoon, Mia and her family are critically injured in a car accident while going on a small road trip with her family. While the family manages to survive, Mia becomes stuck in a coma and experiences an out-of-body experience as a ghost. With her family and friends sitting next to her death bed, Mia must decide whether she should wake up back in her body, or leave and go to heaven. This film flashes back and forth from her in her out-of-body experience watching her family and friends while they are in the hospital, to the events leading up the accident.Upon reading the plot, the film sounded interesting enough. The whole premise of the film is intriguing and captures good attention. This film has some very emotional and touching moments throughout, enough to make viewers reach for the tissues. However, it really tries so hard to take advantage of the emotional tone, to the point where it becomes a bit manipulative. Throughout the picture as the main character's family is trying to cope with the tragedy they are about to face, you can strongly feel their emotions; which is a good thing. But then, when you add the slow tone and the constant sappy music score to it, it tries to be emotionally manipulative, especially when you have the romantic plot between the main character and her boyfriend. While you learn to care for the characters, you get so bored out by the constant sappy tone. Chloe Grace Moretz's performance is what I personally found to be the most appealing aspect of the movie. She does a great job at keeping her character alive, even though her character is critically ill. I also enjoyed the performances by Jamie Blackely and Liana Liberato (Kim, Mia's best friend). Lastly, I thought the film is a little predictable. Some scenes are very easy to guess, and if you watch this, you might know what I'm talking about.If I Stay is not terrible movie, but it isn't too great of a movie either. If you watch this, you may enjoy it. But it is not very likely you'll find a reason to watch it again. While this goes on an hour and 47 minutes, it feels so much longer.",6,1,1,1 September 2015
Training Day," Gritty, thoughtful police drama with an outstanding performance by Denzel Washington
","This unflinchingly realistic police drama takes viewers into the dangerous world of drug dealing that runs rampant in the streets of South Central Los Angeles and where is a subject on nearly every street of the area. Along the side, this film also gives viewers an inside look at the corruption of law enforcement and police brutality that remains a major issue in the United States today. The film places Ethan Hawk in the role of Jake Hoyt, a rookie cop who ventures on a 24- hour 'ride along' with veteran narcotics detective Alonzo Harris (played by Denzel Washington). Cruising through the dirty, crime-ridden streets of Los Angeles, Harris pulls Hoyt in the grueling of crime and drug-busting. However, when Alonzo's lines between right and wrong become blurred and his bold decisions put Hoyt's life at risk, Hoyt soon find himself in a dangerous game of survival. This film is directed by Antoine Faqua and written by David Ayer who would later go on write and direct many other cop dramas. Not many films portray the harrowing reality of the law enforcement as realistically as this one does, and this film does not shy away from the dark side of police corruption as we watch the characters venture through the sordid streets of the South Los Angeles suburbs and experience the violence and gang activity that consumes these neighborhood. Thanks to Denzel Washington who breaks his usual good- guy typecasting to portray a narcotics cop who suffers significant ethical dilemmas and brings his first-time partner in jeopardy. The intensity of his character drives the plot in a long run, to the crescendo in the last half hour of the film At one point during the training, his character busts two teenagers for possession in marijuana with phencycldine, upon taking it he smokes it and then offers it to Ethan Hawke's character who in response smokes it. This scene immediately leaves you questioning on who his character is and leaves you with thoughts that this character could be up to no good. Denzel Washington gives an outstanding performance as Detective Alonzo Harris. Throughout the film, Washington is just drowned out in his role with such powerful effort. It is quite astonishing to see him play in a villainous role so well after watching him play in good-guy roles in his other works. Ethan Hawke does a magnificent job here too. He is shown to be very committed in what is arguably the best role of his career, and his talent shines bright here.Training Day is a highly entertaining movie and a textbook addition to the police drama genre. Complete with mesmerizing performances by Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, powerful directing by Antoina Faqua, and a spectacular screenplay by David Ayer; Training Day definitely hits home.",10,2,2,28 January 2016
John Wick," Sweet, stylish action flick that redefines Keanu Reeves as a visceral action hero
","With the action genre running low on fresh, if not entirely original ideas over the past several years; this stylish action film starring Keanu Reeves as the titular character is one that comes with surprise. This movie sees Reeves reuniting with Chad Stahelski and David Leitch who served as the fight choreographers for the 'Matrix' trilogy, and redefining himself as a new hero with high-trained set of skills with guns and hand-to-hand combat. Although Reeves is no stranger to the action genre since he exploded as the visceral action hero Neo in the Matrix, this film pins the actor into a fine, polished role as a gun-totting hero facing down the guys. Calling this film is a game-changer in the genre would be saying a bit much, but it does indeed stand as one of the most entertaining films of the category. In further words, it shows the genre is still far from dead. Keanu Reeves plays John Wick, a former assassin devastated by the death of his wife. After days of mourning, Wick is surprised with a gift of cute little puppy to help cope with his lonesomeness. While trying to readjust to his life, Wick is visited by a group of Russian mobsters lead by Losef Tarasov (played by Alfie Allen), son of corrupt mob moss Viggo Tarasov (played by Michael Nyqvist), who brutally attack him, destroy his house, steal his Mustang, and murder his poor little puppy. In an act of revenge, Wick must rally up his former accomplices including Marcus (played by William DeFore) and chop shop owner Aurelio (played by John Leguizamo) to hunt them down.This movie provides action movie junkies with plenty of thrills and visceral action set pieces to fuel the adrenaline for most. Although the plot is rather thin and falls short of originality beyond a simple revenge story, the major driving force of the film is the dazzlingly choreographed action sequences along with the compelling character study of our tragic titular protagonist. From the opening scene, John Wick is established as a man with a grim past and faces a deep tragedy with the death of his wife from an illness that is never specified. The beginning effectively breaths humanity into the character without being overly sappy or manipulative, and the final product is a protagonist viewers can sympathize with; even when he journeys to the dark side of gunning down countless individuals. When the action begins, it is truly stunning. The first action set piece takes place in the main character's house where he fights and mows down an array of criminals in a sequence choreographed in a style of what almost resembles a poetic dance routine. And this scene is only the beginning of the enormously high body count he racks up throughout the film. While the action scenes stand out gracefully, the film's shortcoming perhaps come from the characters, mostly from the antagonist category. Alfie Allen and Michael Nyqvist both do their duty in the villain roles but fall victim to rather underwritten characters. Why did they try to kill John Wick, a explanation is never deeply explored (or at least not in a way that is understandable). And William DeFoe's character is given rather little to do. Overall, these come as only minor gripes and should not stand in the way to witness the alluring direction Chad Stahelski and David Leitch drive this fast-paced vehicle.John Wick is a sleek, stylish action thriller that redefines its charismatic lead actor as a visceral action hero, and at best, sprouts as a shining star in the slowly diminishing genre. This film may not shine as a game changer in the genre, it clearly sets a solid example of what meets the criteria of a good action flick.",8,1,5,9 February 2015
Gravity," Poor Plot
","For a film that won seven Oscars, I expected quite a bit. Unfortunately the movie ended up being boring and utterly slow paced. The movie was not scary or suspenseful as I anticipated it to be. While it was visually stunning in some parts, everything else was impressive.This movie follows Dr. Ryan Stone, played Sandra Bullock and veteran astronomer Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney on their mission in space which quickly becomes ill- fated when their space craft is destroyed and their crew ends up getting killed. They must take the matters into their own hands to survive as they're stranded adrift in space.The movie had very little to the plot as it was slow paced, the acting was okay (at least by Sandra Bullock), and there is wasn't much emotionality to the story nor was there any tension to the film, at least after the beginning. The film didn't give me the spine chilling feels that the characters have. Overall, the film was NOT terrible but it wasn't what I was looking for.",4,2,5,5 July 2014
Lone Survivor," Peter Berg unveils a brutal, uncompromising, but ultimately moving picture of the bravery and heroism of Navy Seals
","Peter Berg pulls no punches when showcasing the heroism of U.S soldiers and the tragedy of war that consumes the inner and outer soul of human beings in this gritty retelling of a Navy Seal mission gone terribly wrong. Based on the real-life story told by former Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell who endured an unforgiving taste of active combat, this film sees Berg, director of military action flick 'The Kingdom', high school sports drama 'Friday Night Lights' followed by its television series of the same name, and science-fiction actioner 'Battleship', painting an uncompromising portrait of war in the Middle East laying the groundwork for a true story of a failed 2005 Navy Seal mission Operation Red Wings. It is violent, it is bloody, but most importantly, it is powerful in its testament about the moral complexities that put a group of soldiers' bravery and commitment to the test. And without glorifying war, this movie powerfully strikes at the heart with its mean portrayal of the harsh realities of active combat. The film follows Navy Seals Marcus Lutrell (played by Mark Wahlberg), Lieutenant Michael Murphy (played by Taylor Kitsch), Matthew Axelson (played by Ben Foster), and Danny Dietz (played by Emile Hirsch) who were sent by Commander Erik S. Kristensen (played by Eric Bana) into the mountains of Taliban to take out Taliban leader Ahmad Shah. Upon stumbling across three Taliban civilians, the squad has a heated debate of whether to execute them and risk being charged of a war crime, or letting them go. They choose the latter which leaves them with no choice but to compromise the mission. Unfortunately, before they are able to retreat, they are caught in the crossfires of the Taliban militia. Before they know, they are pitted in a brutal fight for survival. As you can tell by the title, the result of the mission did not end very well. The mission as a whole was a major failure that left its sole survivor in shambles. Nonetheless, the greatest asset lying within Peter Berg's directorial muscle is his gritty demonstration of the soldiers' bravery and commitment to protecting each other in the midst of the chaos that reigned upon them. And he does so without breathing a jingoistic attitude into the mix. If there is a weakness peaking into his portrayal of the grisliness of war, it is his shortage of character development which is left heavily buried under his exhibition of active combat, which follows a turning point sequence where they are forced to make a thought-provoking decision to comply with smart, if questionable moral responsibility. Despite the glaring flaw, that does very little to diminish the brutality of active combat as these four Navy Seals are overwhelmed by a horde of Talibans unleashing their bullets on them, followed by not one but two nasty falls down a cliff that would leave more than a few broken bones. Shot effectively by Tobias Schliesler, these scenes of combat earnestly showcase not only the bravery of these soldiers but to emotional impact that rains on them as they are forced to endure the unforgiving chaos. As for Mark Wahlberg, it does a magnificent job at fueling his role with gripping humanity, as does Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, and Ben Foster working along his side. These four exhibit a palpable chemistry that plays a strong role in the emotional touch during their hour of chaos. Lone Survivor is a brutal, violent, but ultimately moving retelling on a real-life Navy Seal story. It is a powerful picture that has more to say than just 'war is hell', it offers a fair amount of food for thought that many are likely to admire in the midst of the heroism splashed onto nearly every frame. If there are a few tears, there is a good reason for them.",9,1,3,16 May 2015
Erin Brockovich," Julia Roberts steals the spotlight and earns it
","The story of Erin Brockovich is significantly intriguing as much as it is thought-provoking, even if it doesn't make a landmark in America's history. Director Steven Soderbergh gives a lively treatment to the inspirational story with a confident direction and an intelligent screenplay, even when the film begins to feel like a two-hour episode of a television series. Soderbergh's brilliant taste of filmmaking comes to life in a 1993 story of a Californian woman taking on one of the biggest class action lawsuits to ever take place in America, and the result is a true cinematic work of art with just small pinch of shortcoming in the mix. The movie pits Julia Roberts in the role of Erin Brockovich, an unlikable and unemployed single mother of three kids who is involved in a car collision while passing through an intersection. She receives aid from lawyer Ed Masry (played by Albert Finney) to assist her in court, but her profane and disrespectful behavior result in her losing the case. Still stuck on the unemployment lines, Erin successfully convinces Masry to hire her as a file clerk at the law firm. There, she comes across a case involving contamination on the water supply of Hinkley, California done by the Pacific Gas & Electricity Company. With a growing number of Hinkley residents getting ill from the contaminated water, Erin enlists the help of the reluctant Masry to assist her in a case against the multi-billion dollar company. This biographical drama doesn't rise into the rank of the most memorable biopics Hollywood has to offer, nor is it particularly groundbreaking at the least. But what matters most is that it's smart, it's clever, and it features Julia Roberts in a role that definitely defines her career compared to some of the romantic comedies she's endured in the past. Though the rude and surly attitude render of her character make her hard to care for at first, she eventually overcomes her cruel demeanor when she sets out to make a difference for those who are in need of help. Roberts embraces the role with sheer competency and grace (and profanity), it is significantly difficult to point out another role by her that impresses me more. Albert Finney also brings some acting gold in the mix, and his chemistry with co-star Julia Roberts comes on-screen and works quite effectively. Then there is Aaron Eckhart who has plays a motorcycle junkie who moves in next door and after his help with the children, eventually comes her boyfriend but faces a strain in their relationship when her constant work on the case dissolves her time at home. For the charismatic actor he is, he does pretty decent in his role, and does nothing to disappoint the slightest. The cast make admirable appearances on screen in this true story-based film written by Steven Soderbergh that captures true emotion without the temptation of manipulating it with overly sentimental tone, and makes an honest sense of the events that took place leading the title character into a major court case Erin had a very high chance of losing in trial. It was an important case where justice that meant not money, but the lives of the people affected by the wrongdoing of a filthy rich utility company. With people getting ill and some dying, Erin knew something had to be done. Erin Brockovich is an endearing biographical drama that leaves a landmark on both Julia Roberts and director Steven Soderbergh's career. It is a fascinating movie with a just a few flaws that are overshadowed with greatness and therefore difficult to point out. When taking about Julia Roberts, this film is the role she is likely remembered for.",7,2,2,10 August 2016
Se7en," Dark, grisly, and highly intelligent edge-of-your-seat thriller
","David Fincher has been one of most thoughtful directors in Hollywood for many years, and his ingenious filmmaking all started in the mid- 1990s with this grim, but intelligently crafted psychological thriller. This film follows David Mills (played by Brad Pitt), a newly transferred police detective in an unnamed crime-ridden metropolitan city, who is partner with an old veteran detective William Somerset (played by Morgan Freeman) who is on the verge of retirement, to investigate a string of gruesome murders all around the city. These murders happen to correlate with the seven deadly sins which include: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, and wrath. Mills and Somerset take in matters in their own hands to hunt down the sadistic serial killer (played by an actor who I'm gonna keep a secret) responsible for the grisly murders, only to be faced with a scarring truth about his intentions.This David Fincher masterpiece is not a horror film, but it certainly sits directly at the borderline of one. Complete with eerie visuals and near non-stop suspense from start to finish, this film pulls audience into an unflinchingly grim atmosphere that leaves shivers down their spine and rarely lightens up. To add more to the dark tone, it rain in nearly every scene taking place outside to give them a more somber look. As the plot progresses, the audience are treated with nauseating afterviews of the serial killer's murder. But instead of having the camera linger over the gory details of the victims, we are giving heavy implications of how they particularly occurred. These scenes do just enough without the suspenseful music score to leave viewers at the edge of their seats. Then there is the serial killer himself who is portrayed as very sadistic, almost Lecter Hannibul-like, and creepy in appearance. His way of outwitting the main characters are quite shocking. The actor who plays him does an incredible job on his portrayal. As the story continues on, it builds up to one of the most haunting conclusions ever put to film, an ending that really pushes the boundaries. Ultimately, it works pretty well.Se7en is one of the well-crafted and twisted thrillers I've ever seen and one of the spine-chilling films Hollywood has to offer, thanks to the incredible camera-work, brilliant direction by David Fincher and fantastic script by Andrew Kevin Walker. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman who play the main characters show amazing chemistry on screen together and their performances work pretty well. While the film is really great, it is definitely not recommended for the faint of heart.",10,5,7,20 November 2015
The Big Lebowski," One of the most entertaining films by the Coen Brothers
","Joel and Ethan Coen have stood high in the ranking of some of the best directors in Hollywood for the last two decades, and still to this today continue to make some of the biggest masterpieces. This black comedy starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi, is a movie that did not perform well with critics nor saw much sunshine at the box office,; but eventually went on to becoming a cult classic and one of the my favorite comedies to date. This film follows Jeff Lebowski (played by Jeff Bridges), a drifter who lives under the name 'The Dude' as his name happens to be the same name as a billionaire. To matters worse, this billionaire is married to a woman who is in serious debt and owes money to some of the most dangerous individuals in Los Angeles. With The Dude mistaken as the billionaire (played by David Huddleston), the Lebowksi's wife Bunny Lebowski (played by Tara Reid) is kidnapped by the dangerous men and orders The Dude to get their money. With the help of his bowling buddies Walter Sobchak (played by John Goodman) and Donny Kerabatsos (played by Steve Buscemi), his plan makes a turn for the worst when he gets involved a series of dangerous schemes including corrupt police officers and Lebowkski's erotic daughter Maude (played by Julianne Moore).The Coen Brothers are often known for mixing genres in their films. This film pervades with a straight balance of comedy with a serious undertone, an achievement many black comedies do not do too well nowadays. What we get from this picture is a hilarious movie with an entertaining plot (though complex), solid performances, and some of the most memorable characters. Jeff Bridges nails it as the titular character, giving sharp dialogue and a clever sense of humor; none one could have played Jeff Lebowski a.k.a The Dude better than he. Jeff Bridges fits the bill. Then John Goodman who plays Walter Sobchak is quite hilarious and delivers some of the most clever lines in the film, though his character may have quite a crude personality, that is what makes him the funny man he is. The rest of the cast hits a home as well. The chemistry between Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi works astonishingly well; whenever these three hit the screen, that is when viewers should be ready for a hilarious good time, especially when John Turturro comes on screen. The humor, though not inspiring, is nicely written by Joel and Ethan Coen in ways to make it work, rather than beat down on clichéd gags. The only major flaw viewers may encounter is the difficulty connecting with the plot as it does tend to veer some odd directions at various points. Nonetheless, there are plenty of surprises, and twists and turns to keep the plot captivating.The Big Lebowski takes position as one of the Coen Brothers' best works, and one of the comedies of the 1990s. Thanks to the strong performances by an talented cast, clever dialogue, surprising humor, and solid characters; this film is one worth checking out for everyone.",8,0,2,21 January 2016
Fury," Gritty, violent, and highly entertaining World War II flick with solid performances
","David Ayer's dark and gritty take on World War II boasts a powerful representation on the horrifying reality of war. In short words, it has nothing to say other than 'War is hell', or as Brad Pitt's character puts it 'Ideals are peaceful, history is violent'. Shining on screen is a stellar cast of actors taking on roles of soldiers in this violent, gory World War II flick that shies away from director David Ayer's typical works which often deal with police drama ('End of Watch', 'Street Kings'). And what David Ayer pedals on screen this time is a crew of soldiers who face the unforgiving reality of war on the European battlefront, which is no stranger to lead Brad Pitt who wielded the role of Nazi-killing Lieutenant Aldo Rain in Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds' five years ago. In further detail, he proceeds not with the goal to give viewers a bleak history lesson, but to simply tell a story that feels parallel to what being in active combat feels like, even if the plot feels slightly run-of-the-mill. Set in April of 1945 near the conclusion of World War II on the European Theater, Brad Pitt plays Wardaddy, a war-hardened staff sergeant leading of his crew of men in an M4 Sherman Tank through the European battlefields to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany. His courageous crew includes a religious soldier named Boyd 'Bible' Swan (played by Shia Labeouf), flamboyant gun-loader Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis (played by Jon Bernthal), Mexican tank driver Trini 'Gordo' Garcia (played by Michael Pena), and the newly hired assistant driver Norman Ellis (played by Logan Lerman). Together, these crew of men fight through the violent fields of Germany while struggling to cope with a bloodshed horrors of active combat.Although David Ayer's rendition of World War II on the European front doesn't flourish the same emotionally gravitas as 'Saving Private Ryan' (unsurprisingly), it paints a highly disturbing portrait of the harsh reality of war in a way that rarely pulls the punches. When the crew enters the battlegrounds, heads are blown off, soldiers are engulfed in flames, bodies are torn apart, and our characters bravely pursue through the fields knowing they can be killed in any second. If there are any moments that offer levity, they cam from the occasional humorous one-liners that the characters spit out every now and then. All in all, they do little to sugarcoat the grueling atmosphere that pervades this emotionally blistering trek. The story focuses on a crew of men crammed inside the tight confinement of a Sherman Tank, and newest member on the ride is Logan Lerman's character Norman Ellis, a young typist who's inexperienced in active combat. Upon first entering the battlegrounds, Norman struggles vigorously on coping with the horrors of war as opposed to Brad Pitt's Wardaddy who's seen it all since the beginning. As the story proceeds, Norman grows a broader eye on the truth of war that puts to maximum test in the climatic battle sequence during the final third. And his character's growth from cowardly to bravely is handled mostly well, though it feels a little rushed towards the end in the aforementioned battle sequence. As for the rest of the characters who are left in a two-dimensional state (except Wardaddy), they are not only fortunately energized with cast's solid performances that speak high volumes of the actors' talents, but very human in their portrayal (though Jon Bernthal character's shows slight resemblance of a caricature).Fury is gritty, violent, but highly entertaining World War II flick empowered by a powerful direction by David Ayer and solid performances by a likable cast. While the film may not hold the same amount of emotional gravitas as other high-ranked films of the genre, it is honest in it's portrait of war and stands strong as a powerful picture.",9,4,8,28 January 2015
Fight Club," An incredible thrill ride
","There is a lot to be handed in this dark, atmospheric adaption of Chuck Palahniuk's novel. Ranging from the visceral storytelling, rollicking screenplay, and the mind-stunning flair of David Fincher's directing flair, this brooding tale stars Edward Norton and Brad Pitt in a psychological thriller that packs load of thrills and engrossing narrative substance while generating a powerful social message about violence in society. The film initially faced polarizing reception by critics for what was originally interpreted as an a glorification of brutal violence and moral ambiguity but was later redeemed by a wide acclaimed cult status, soon becoming one of the most talked-about (and controversial) films of 1999. Edward Norton plays an unnamed protagonist, a disillusioned white-collar worker who suffers from insomniac and finds nowhere to turn from his bored life. This is until he seeks therapy from not a sleep therapist but a support group of unfortunate men with testicular cancer, despite not having such. His time there helps him deal with his mental and emotional health, and it is all ruined when he is visited by mysterious woman Marla Singer (played by Helena Bonham Carter) and unintentionally exposes him. Soon, the protagonist befriends with an anarchistic soap salesman Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt) who he partners with open up an underground fight club where two competitors engage in a no- holds-barred hand-to-combat in front of the large crowd as a mean of therapy. However, as the club grows popular, it ignites to a widespread anarchy that leads to the protagonist discovering Tyler's more sinister plot.This David Fincher thriller packs a serious punch and leaves quite an impact from its excess of not only its gripping story but thrills that go beyond what anyone can label conventional. It all begins with the atmospheric visuals punctuated throughout each scene to symbolize a society on the brink of collapse. But there is much more to offer. The story bogs down into a gritty, hyperkinetic crime-thriller sparked by bold machismo elements delivered by scenes of brutal, cringe-inducing fist fights resulting in bloodshed, and a gripping message about the effects of violence in our society. The film takes on a mission to show violence not as a grueling recreational activity but a means of letting out the characters' inner demons. From there on, the plot builds up through a dark, visceral journey, leading up to a shocking revelation that is bound leave viewers stunned, though not as haunting as the finale to David Fincher's 'Seven'. And what comes of this masterful experience, deserves a strong memorable cast, an element the film greatly achieves. Edward Norton stands strong in his role as the central character, conceiving pure likability in his largely naive character battling against the moral ambiguity that threatens to tear him apart. Helena Bonham Carter is also quite resourceful in arguably one of her most memorable roles. But the biggest appeal arrives of course, from Brad Pitt as the anarchistic Tyler Durden. Though his character may give off a disconcerting vibe, Pitt delivers a performance that can be described as darkly funny and oddly charismatic, leading to what is by far one of the powerful performances of his career. Fight Club is an incredible experience put together by the astounding mind of director David Fincher. Full of thrills, visceral themes, and overall surprising social commentary; this film puts on a stunning cinematic thrill ride that's not easily forgotten. Though the violent material and gritty anti-social theme are enough to push sensitive viewers away, it's not easy to deny this packs a punch.",9,0,1,25 May 2016
Monster," Charlize Theron gives a prodigious portrayal of an unsettling tragic figure in this disturbing, yet gripping biography
","Most serial killers we know in the celluloid are associated with the slasher-horror genre, with such figures as Michael Myers, Jason Voorhes , and Freddy Krueger. What does these serial killers have in common? They are all based on fiction. Director Patty Jenkins offers a deeply upsetting account of a serial killer who is not work of fiction but was in fact a real-life figure who was enough to sit in the category with such grisly figures as Ted Bundy and Charles Manson. This woman's name was Aileen Wuornos, and she was not a very friendly human being. Capitalizing on the tragic accounts of its central figure who is now deceased after sentenced to death by lethal injection, this film offers a grim, yet realistic portrayal on the dark side of human kind, a path that lead to the death of both innocent and non-innocent individuals. The title could not be justifiable, and Jenkins makes the daunting, yet triumphant choice of casting Charlize Theron in the subject role in effort to support that claim. Set in 1989, this film chronicles the life of Aileen Wuornos (played by Charlize Theron), an unlaundered woman growing up in Daytona Beach as a prostitute while developing a lesbian relationship with Selby (played by Christina Ricci) who grows up in a religious family. Selby's family immediately disapproves of her and unaware of her desire to turn her life around. That proves to be easier said than done when she struggles to land a job due to her criminal record and lack of social kills. On the night of what is supposed to be her last customer of dirty business turns into a bloodbath when she brutally murders her client who tries to rape her. This night soon marks the beginning of her homicidal life. Patty Jenkins does not aim for a horror movie approach nor does she stray into the degree of exploitation when drawing the grim portrait of Wuornos. Nonetheless, the film certainly has a feel of a horror film not only because of the brutality of her behavior but also due to the fact that it is inspired by true events. Although Jenkins takes just a few liberties from the documented tale, she does not fail paint a picture on the abhorrent nature of the film's tragic figure. Charlize Theron is the apex of the film. While Theron has never been resorted to particular typecasting, this film marks her first time in a role residing the wrong side of the moral compass. Shaving her eyebrows and gaining thirty pounds to maintain Aileen Wuarnos's distasteful appearance, Theron disappears into the role boasting an incredible amount of ferocity and grit that greatly sticks out in each scene when she has a startling encounter with her 'sex customers'. The story goes out of its way to portray not necessarily as a nihilistic figure, but a woman who believes killing is part of human nature, as he addresses in one scene. 'People kill because of politics, because of religion' she cries during this scene which is an accurate account of what goes on our society as well as around the world. Her relationship with Christina Ricci is suitably mapped out. That is not to say that the two actresses share a fashionable chemistry. But each the two are on screen, there performances shine diligently, and their heart-thumping relationship propels to a bittersweet conclusion when Aileen comes to realize the filthy nature of her image. Monster is deeply disturbing and frequently uncomfortable to sit through, yet marks for a gripping biopic of its central figure thanks to the poignant performances by Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci and intelligent direction by Patty Jenkins. As painful as it is, the movie speaks a truth of human nature and Jenkins never tarnishes his feat in favor of exploitation. For those mature enough to dive into this tragic story, the film is a fascinating tale.",8,0,0,17 July 2017
Inglourious Basterds," Quentin Tarantino's audacious revenge fantasy deliver a sucker punch of darkly funny entertainment
","Quentin Tarantino brings his snappy filmmaking methodology and signature dark humor in the European front of World War II in this black comedy. The story on board here is a revenge fantasy against the sadistic dictator Adolf Hitler, leader of the Third Reich who threatened to dominate the eastern hemisphere during the early years of World War II. As opposed to be the typical Hollywood formula which often offers a more somber take on the grim subject matter, Tarantino defies against the usual standards, placing his tongue in his cheek with snappy, yet darkly funny dialogue and wildly colorful characters that suitably match up with his bold artistic style. The film is very talky with sudden bursts of graphic violence punctuating each sequence, but one thing that is for sure is that Tarantino is always consistent with keeping things bold and satirically funny while staying true its subversive nature. Set in the early 1940s, this film follows Lieutenant Aldo Raine (played by Brad Pitt), a bold-spirited American soldier who rallies up a team of young Jewish soldiers on a mission to murder Nazis in attempt to pursue after Third Reich leader Adolf Hitler. And he has a baseball- wielding Donny Donowitz (played by Eli Roth) at his assistance. This plan unexpectedly coincides with a similar plot hosted by German actress Bridget Von Hammersmark (played by Diane Kruger) and Shosanna Dreyfus (played by Melanie Laurent), an owner of a French movie theater, who has plans hosting a Nazi propaganda movie for the Nazi Party; which will allow her to burn down the theater to kill the party in revenge for the murder of her family at the hands of one of Hitler's sinister accomplices SS Colonel Hans Landa (played by Christoph Waltz) Quentin Tarantino is not a director who typically exercises realism, as demonstrated in his previous works. In the case of this audacious black comedy, realism is not something you should come to expect as Tarantino pursues for a more satirical rendition on a war story that is never found in the history books but instead takes liberties from World War II's long and unsettling history. It is bold, yet engaging method that allows the director to establish an anarchic spirit into the plot while injecting a slew of devilishly striking dialogue and humor that pushes the boundaries of comedic edginess. From the opening scene introducing Christoph's Waltz's Hans Landa in a long conversation followed by a jarring massacre that sets one of the story lines in motion, this film journeys through a steady pace of interconnecting characters coming together to face down against the tyrannical ruler Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich, and is all exhibited a series of long stretches of conversations constructed with snappy Tarantino-style dialogue (most of which is spoken in German and French with English subtitles) punctuated with an unexpected burst o violence that leads to plenty of bloodletting and death. And it is all done with satisfying results, which is significantly impressive consider the prolonged 153-minute runtime. While those unfamiliar with Tarantino's style are likely to find themselves bored to death and disgusted the gruesome acts of violence committed sporadically throughout the proceeding, others will be wildly engaged in the director's outstanding method of writing and sketching out the characters. With each scene effectively building up to the ultra-violent, yet sucker punch of a climax, there is almost never a moment that feels squandered.Brad Pitt, making his inauguration into the Tarantino universe, plays Lieutenant Aldo Raine, delivering each line of dialogue of bold spirit and enthusiasm to make his character stand out a pot of gold. Eli Roth also gets his time to shine in one scene where he delivers his revenge on an unapologetic Nazi. It is an aggressively brutal, but without a touch of humor, and Roth plays it out with great versatility. Melanie Laurent is great as Shosanna, nothing that will blow anyone else of the cast out of the water however. Daniel Bruhl, playing a small role as a French sniper with a fascination for Shosanna, is good. But again, nothing special. Without the doubt the big star in the crowd is Christoph Waltz who plays Colonel Hans Landa, the dubious German accomplice of the Third Reich with a sinister agenda. Portraying the character with unexpected charisma and humanity, Waltz goes against the grimness of a mindless Jew Hunter in favor of a more satirical portrayal of a morally despicable, and his performance shines like gold. Then there are few widely recognizable actors like Mike Myers and Michael Fassbender popping in small roles with sweet performances, but not enough to make them too memorable. And in like most of his works, Tarantino also leaves plenty of room for some less-known actors playing in minor roles. Too many to name, but the best I can say it that they are all mostly solid. Inglourious Basterds is an audacious, yet devilishly entertaining take on World War II, and a solid demonstration on why Quentin Tarantino is such a respected Hollywood tycoon. It is violent, it is talky, but not without the clever methodology of Tarantino to keep things engaging and shockingly funny. This film is a shark that demands that is hungry for your attention, if you handle the ballsy nature of Tarantino's direction.",9,1,3,28 August 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," This electrifying installment in the Star Wars saga delivers one of the best in its acclaimed franchise
","When J.J Abrams suited the director's chair for the widely anticipated 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' last year, he proved to be an obliging hand to drive the acclaimed franchise in a worthy, if slightly flawed direction. Though it fell short of expectations for some hardcore fans with many painting it's overwhelming similarities to 'Episode IV: New Hope', he managed to open light on a bright path for the series. This year, Hollywood brings us something new to the series in favor of the first stand-alone entry since the franchise's debut. Directed by Gareth Edwards, the man behind 2014's 'Godzilla'; this pins a spectacular installment that mounts a bridge between the chronology of 'Episode III: Revenge of The Sith' and 'New Hope'. Instead of revolving around the story of the family of Luke Skywalker, it tackles on the trajectory of the demise of the Death Star we witnessed in the fourth episode, with a focus on a whole new set of characters. This film follows Jyn Erso (played by Felicity Jones), a rebellion soldier with a grim past who must team with an Alliance Intelligence officer Cassian Andor (played by Diego Luna) and his wise-cracking robot K-2SO (voiced by Alan Tudyk) to steal plans from the Death Star from the possession of former Republic leader Orson Krennic (played by Ben Mendleston). Joining along their side is a blind swordsman (played by Donnie Yen) and his faithful sidekick (played by Wen Jiang) in an epic showdown.A stand-alone to the Star Wars universe is an idea fans everywhere have speculated for quite some time, and the final product Gareth Edwards delivers of this concept works surprisingly well if a few blemishes. Like in the previous entries, the story is biggest hallmark that defines the film as it focuses on a part-heist, part-action plot set to connect the events of Darth Vader's origins in George Lucas's often loathed prequel trilogy and the classic trilogy that started it all. Following the story of rebellion warrior Jyn, this film focuses on her journey to save the galaxy an anticipated doom conducted by the Death Star. When she eventually joins with some unfamiliar allies that, that is when we are introduced the plot along with a string of new characters that sadly do not carry the same heart and interest as the cast of characters from the first trilogy. Cassian Andor and his robotic sidekick K-2SO make a fine duo, especially with the latter cracking some comedic one-liners every chance he's on screen. But they definitely don't fall in line with Hans Solo and Chewbacca. Though the plot kicks on a rather meandering start during the first half, Edwards manages to serve justice in the second half once the big action combat scenes kick in and we witness our heroes engage in a tense, climatic showdown complete with stellar special effects and CGI. The space battles stir some fun too but perhaps nothing special beyond what we seen the last installments. And if you expecting good cinematography expand upon the beauty of the action, these scenes include that as well with Greig Fraser providing hefty camera work capture the heat of the bombastic mayhem.Felicity Jones makes a likable appeal as our main hero Jyn Erso but the manner in which her character doesn't quite boost near on the levels of our more memorable protagonists like Luke Skywalker. Diego Luna, often known for more dramatic work in the Mexican film industry, delivers a charismatic appeal as Cassian Andor; and his chemistry with the wise-cracking robot K-2SO provides charm almost every minute they hit the screen. But like Jyn Erso, he falls of a memorable character. Working along their side is Donnie Yen who shows off an adrenaline-fueled testosterone as a blind swordsman in a few extravagant fighting sequences, and Jiang Wen who shares a close companionship with Yen but nothing remarkable beyond few catchy one-liners. Forest Whitaker as Saw Generra (based on the character from the animated series) makes the best of his rather short screen time, though his sore-throat like voice can get little pesky. Arguably the most stand-out figure aside from the lead character Jyn is the villain Orson Krennic who is played by Ben Mendleston with a fairly solid performance. But the arresting spirit of the franchise's previous antagonists such as the culturally iconic Darth Vader and last year's Kylo Ren is sadly abandoned in this villain. Lucky for us, Gareth Edwards manages the squeeze Darth Vader into the story in which furnishes him just a few minutes of screen time including one exhilarating quick-time action sequence during the final twenty minutes. Beyond this, it is Orson Krennic who mostly steals the villain's throne.Rogue One: A Star Wars story is a fantastic entry of stand-alone anthology film of the Star Wars cinematic universe. It marks a fine achievement for director Gareth Edwards who successfully ties a string connecting the conclusion of George Lucas's prequel trilogy and the more acclaimed trilogy, and opens the door for an enormous (and predictable) success at the box office. At best, it keeps the franchise gearing for a bright future.",8,2,10,16 December 2016
This Is the End," This energetic all-star doomsday comedy is as funny, energetic, and charming as it sets out to be
","What kind of fun and laughter should be expected from a movie starring an ensemble group of A-list actors taking on the end of the world? A lot, actually. That is the purpose writer and directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg bring to the table of this energetic hard-R comedic cornucopia that places a team of comedic veterans in the battle for survival against the biblical apocalypse. That's right, the main elephant in the room is the apocalypse described in the Book of Revelations. But with a sharp delivery of raunchy R- rated humor and dialogue dropped into the mix, this is not one Christians should go into expecting something in the vain of 'Left Behind'. It is an unflinchingly raunchy take on the biblical disaster, spliced with wild bursts of laughter and clever pop culture references, of all which are delivered by actors who all playing not original characters but fictional versions of their real-life personas. So here it how everything goes down. Seth Rogen invites his friend Jay Barachul to a party at James Franco's house where Rogen introduces him to Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, and an enormous crowd of other actors who make minor cameos including Michael Cera, David Krumholtz, Rihanna, Jason Segal, Emma Watson, and many others -- most of whom do not make it to the end. While Rogen is having a good time, the wild partying doesn't quite bode well with Barachul. Things only get worse when the city of Los Angeles is suddenly devastated by series of catastrophic events during what Barachul believes is Judgement Day as described the bible. When the enormous disasters claims the lives of the vast majority of the party, the only survivors are Rogen, Barachul, Hill, Robinson, Franco, and later Danny McBride who crashes the party. As everyone is barricaded inside Franco's house, the six friends struggle to survive against the disaster that places their friendships to the test -- with reasonably hilarious results. There are plenty of surprises to expect from a comedy-doomsday hybrid revolving around actors playing satirical versions of themselves. Aside from shredding the bushes with familiar disaster elements, the A- list cast has plenty of offer in the midst of the scorching R-rated raunchiness. Blurring the lines between reality and fiction, Each of the cast members splashes us with a solid delivery with meta-humor and clever pop cultures with the purpose of poking fun at each other's real-life careers. For instance, Seth Rogen and James Franco pin themselves in a key plot point regarding a sequel to 'Pineapple Express', a comedy starring the two. And the cast makes great fun of it in one scene involving a cheeky reenactment of the fan-based trailer uploaded online as an April Fools' joke. Furthermore, it is no surprise that these six actors, all of whom had collaborated in the past, share an irresistible chemistry with each other. The foul-mouthed banter, consisting of gut-busting raunchy one-liners, is the driving force of the story and almost never fails to hit at the funny bone. And let's not forget a scene focusing on Emma Watson, or an early scene portraying the goofy, immature persona of Michael Cera. Is it consistently funny? Not quite, especially when it dives into a preposterous subplot involving Jonah Hill toward the end. But their gift for tapping into the laugh box with their hilarity and heartful themes of friendship are endearing and make up for the occasional blemishes in the script. Of course, the irreverent treatment of the biblical apocalypse will, with no surprise; leave filmgoers bound in their Christian faith, with a cold shoulder. That is if they even bother to withstand the lewd nature of the film. Four-letter words, vulgar sex jokes, there is more than enough to overwhelm those who are converted to the Seth Rogen comedic fare. This Is The End is a wildly entertaining comedy soaring with sharp comedic energy from a cast of infectiously charming comedic veterans. It is a fun comedic fare that stands high on the ladder of its genre. Anyone hungry for an order of raunchy laughs with a side of a little heart and smarts is gifted with a chance of experiencing what maybe one of the funniest comedies in recent years. Not a game- changer, but an entry that warrants a solid 'thumps up'.",9,1,2,21 August 2017
Alien: Resurrection," There is plenty of gore and gross special effects to go around, but not enough flair and scares to resurrect the series
","The Alien franchise had a promising debut when Ridley Scott ignited the first film in 1979, and James Cameron embraced the spirit of the film with a highly enthralling follow-up in 1986. This series however, met an unexpected downward turn when the third installment came in, not only butchering the franchise but placing director David Fincher on a not-so-compelling directorial debut. Since then, Fincher is now disowned the film. There was only hope that this unexpected fourth installment would be pull the franchise out of its rusty pit. Unfortunately, that was a dream that went to die. Taking the director's chair this time around is French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Jeunet who manages to strip the film of the beauty that made the first two entries hits and slaps it with an inept script by Joss Whedon, placing this installment in a borderline laughable debacle. Now the franchise opens the door to the question of how and who is supposed to get this now-gloomy franchise back on its feet. Set in 200 years after the events of 'Alien 3', this film follows a space crew consisting of Call (played by Winona Ryder), 'tough-guy' Johner (played by Ron Perlman), wheelchair-bound Captain Vriess (played by Dominique Pinon), Christie (played by Gary Dourdan) along with several others who conduct a biological experiment to extract the Queen Alien out of the long- dead Ellen Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver)and resurrect her back to life. However, her DNA has already been paired with the Queen, and the crew must now face against a vicious alien bloodbath that places the lives of everyone in grave danger. This dour fourth entry suffers from not only failing bring anything new to the table rather than recycling the nearly all the same elements from before, but somehow managing to produce more unintentional laughter than scares. If there are any accolades that surround this movie besides taking the crown of drenching the screen with most gore and slime, is coming up just a few fun action sequences involving the space crew chased down the tunnels by the ugly extraterrestrial creatures and a few scenes of our heroes mowing down the aliens with loud, noisy bloodbath. Beyond that, it appears that Jean- Pierre Jeunet struggles to execute the action without it feeling like a tug-o-war between the grim atmosphere and Joss Whedon's otherwise more light-hearted script. Recycling on run-of-the mill formula, this movie journeys through the characters' battle for survival, while adding some awkward elements to the mix including giving Ellen Ripley what appears to be sexual tension between her and the Queen Alien. This accounts to an awkward scene toward the end that is bound to spear viewers with a sense of embarrassing discomfort than scare. Who wants to see Ripley get intimate with a flesh-eating xenomorph? If that isn't farcical enough, Whedon's script also manages to pair each character, particularly Ron Perlman, with a large surplus of one ludicrous one-liner after another. In addition, how funny does this trying to by poking fun at Dominique Pinon's character being in the wheelchair in the midst of all the chaos? As for the performances, there is not much gold to offered here, even from Sigourney Weaver. While her performance is not necessarily bad, the unwholesome portrayal of her character strips the actress of all her charisma that made her a powerful character in the beginning. Alien: Resurrection marks a dismal attempt to revitalize the broken franchise, and settles for both an unpolished direction and script that accounts for more silliness than white-knuckle thrills. Not many can doubt that this entry had a fair amount of potential. But oh boy! It only corresponds to a soul-sucking letdown.",4,0,1,25 May 2017
World War Z," Action-horror flick brings out the fun and energy
","In this action-horror flick based on the hit novel by Max Brooks, Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a retired United Nations work with a plan on taking his wife (played by Mirielle Enos) and two young daughters on a vacation. His plans are quickly interrupted when a deadly pandemic scatters through their town in Philidelphia and causes a massive zombie invasion. Before too long, zombies begin taking over the universe as the virus spreads on a global scale. In an effort to save the future of mankind, Gerry must travel across the world in search for a cure to the virus while surviving the massive zombie onslaught. This film is directed by Marc Foster who made Kite Runner (2007) and Quantum Solace (2008).This film is an adaption to Max Brook's novel World War Z, but it does however manage to take many liberties from the novel and create a complete original story. Nonetheless, this film does not fail to entertain and bring on the thrills. Many fans however were sparked with disappointment when they learned of the PG-13 rating. While it does take away from the blood and gory fun that many zombie fans root for, the film manages to be fun and action-packed without heavy use of blood and gore. The action sequences were spectacular and the same can be said for the special effects. The zombies look good while maintain their gross, sickish appearance. The zombie attack scene on the airplane was probably the best scene throughout the film. It really showed the best of the special effects this film carries. Unlike most zombie films, the zombies in this one are super fast and when someone gets bitten and infected, they turn within a matter of 'like' ten seconds. The plot also worked well here, even though the pacing does slip towards the final stretch. As the story progresses, it comes clear that it is not exactly about zombies attacking the world, but focuses on the downfall of humanity. On the other hand, it is still action-packed and compelling as it needs to be.World War Z is one of the best summer flicks of 2013. Even if its not too faithful to Max Brook's source material, it is still enjoyable and succeeds with an entertaining story, dazzling special effects, and action scenes that will hold your attention.",8,1,1,12 September 2015
Passengers," This extravagant science-fiction adventure strives for visual compulsion, but suffers from a blemished execution
","Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are easily some of the most likable actors in the Hollywood roster, so placing these two together in a fun cinematic adventure wouldn't be a bad idea. But a duo of charismatic entities and a eye-feasting visual style only have the muscle to make of half the equation for this science- fiction adventure. This movie, which introduces a thought-provoking idea supplemented with themes of moral dilemmas, has a fair sense of potential shining through its cracks. But what happens when your concept is plagued by a problematic execution that involves places a huge twist in the arguably the most inconvenient time? In other words, that is my way of explaining how the ethical dilemma that was greatly obscured in the advertising. So in an effort to discuss the highs and lows of this science-fiction piece, this review will require me to discuss some aspects that may contain spoilers. Set in the near-future, this film is set on a spaceship known as the Starship Avalon which carries thousands of passengers each in a hibernation chamber on a 120-year voyage to another planet. When a malfunction in the ship causes Jim (played by Chris Pratt) to wake up from his hibernation chamber 90 years early, he finds himself stranded alone on the ship with no one to talk to but an humanoid bartender (played by Michael Sheen). He is later joined by a hot blondie named Aurora (played by Jennifer Lawrence) who's sleep chamber is also deactivated. Together, the two form a bond that is greatly interrupted when the ship begins to malfunction. The filmmaker behind this vehicle is Morten Tyldum, who last spawned the World War II thriller 'The Imitation Game'. This director proves to have a ingenuity in the visual department. The spaceship design is firmly original, and the visual effects which play a major role in the second half serve a nice treat for the eyes, while owing principles to entities like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Interstellar'. While the film not only sets stone to an intriguing premise but also feeds clear evidence that director Tyldum has strong ambition for thoughtful ideas, his way of handling the cerebral concept leads a lot to be questioned. The story kicks off on a friendly start with Chris Pratt exploring the ship while struggling to figure out the solution behind his dilemma. These first minutes are executed with great effort to establish the thought-provoking nature of his character. But it's not long before the film makes the fatal decision of taking the cat out of the bag and reveal a shocking twist that unravels an morally depraved nature of Chris Pratt's character before the story even reaches its halfway point. In return, when the revelation is discovered by Jennifer Lawrence, the result lacks impact and therefore kills the element of surprise. Although the story handles his morally dubious act is an sympathetic manner regardless of whether or not viewers will commiserate his actions, it sadly falls shallow of surprises, especially when it inexplicably tosses the idea out the window in the final act. On the bright side, the film has its exciting moments, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence share a sweet chemistry as well as some humorous moments that lighten the weight of the morbid premise. Michael Sheen on the other hand, is given little to do other than provide a stoic portrayal of a humanoid bartender who shares a few clever conversations with Pratt.Passengers is flawed science-fiction extravaganza that spares some clever moments and thoughtful themes of morality, while undergoing a problematic execution. While there is no doubt Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt will the the major draw, the film stumbles in its potential to reel out a masterfully intriguing concept. Nonetheless, it can still make for a fun ride.",6,0,0,19 April 2017
Zootopia," Wildly entertaining and fun for the whole family
","When Disney Animation Studios releases a new picture, it is almost guaranteed to gain an outstanding receipt at the box office. Disney has managed to come with many great surprises over the last six decades, and although there have been a few disappointments every now and then, they have proved to have effective standards on gaining the attention of audiences everywhere. In this new Disney animated picture, Ginnifer Goodwin does the voice of Judi Hopps, a bunny with the dreams of becoming the first bunny to be a cop instead of settling with a typical bunny job of farming carrots, much to the doubt of every other animals in the world. Standing against all odds, she makes it through the police academy and wins position as a cop in the police department headed by a rhino Chief Bogo (voiced by Idris Alba) of Zootopia, a city where all animal types, predator and prey, get along well. When a case of fourteen missing otters comes up, Judi steps up and volunteers for the case and is given 48 hours to crack the case with the help of a con artist fox named Nick (voiced by Jason Bateman). Featuring a supporting cast of Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Bonnie Hunt, J.K Simmons, Don Lake, Octavia Spencer, Shakira, and many others; this animated picture brings solid laughter to please kids and adults alike while conveying its deep crucial message that resonates with the issues that go on in our society today.I was utterly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. It took me by a surprise on many levels. While it succeeds on bringing decent family-friendly laughter and eye-popping state-of-the-art animation that shows how far we have come along with technology with recent years, one of the most surprising aspects comes from its political message about society and the issues that America struggles with today. One of which is racism. As the story follows a bunny who pursues her dreams of becoming a police officer while battling the doubt of many who believe bunnies are too small and weak to survive as cops, it underlines an example of how racism and prejudice still affects our society. And as the film progresses, it digs deeper and deeper into this theme and the message grew more powerful, giving the story a more intellectual feel while still entertaining the audiences with its light-hearted humor. And the movie balances this so well that to where it can appeal to both adults, children, and even teens alike. While kids may not pick up on its message and just shrug off depending on their age, they will nonetheless find joy and laughter at the uplifting story and outgoing humor. Yes, there are a few jokes that only adults will pick up on, but plenty of kids jokes are thrown out here as well. Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are both fantastic as the two main characters, the same goes for Idris Alba as the rhino who at first has doubts for Judi serving for the police department for the small little bunny she is. The film also has a message about not giving up and following your dreams regardless of what people tell you, and I think that is an important message kids will to come learn. Zootopia is by far one of the best animated features I have seen in a long time, and one every family should go see. It is very funny, very original, and astoundingly entertaining on many levels. And it is pretty safe to say this movie could make a contender for the Best Animated Picture at the Oscars. I strongly encourage everyone to go see this!",10,10,22,18 March 2016
12 Monkeys," Terry Gilliam flourishes an exhilarating vision, and Twelve Monkeys powerfully demonstrates it
","Director Terry Gilliam is a man with a vision that many could only describe as one-of-a-kind, if visceral. If he's proved anything over his previous efforts, with 'Brazil' being his magnum opus, it is that he knows how to exceed in potently building up a dazzling visual heft while carrying on a solid narrative. Gilliam effectively accomplishes this feat in this dystopian science-fiction thriller, and the best part is how well he manages to operate on a script that is not only intelligent but feels vastly original. Though it is clear Terry Gilliam borrows a few elements from other entries in the genre, his execution still feels fresh. And with the charismatic performances by the lead actor Bruce Willis, supporting actress Madeline Stowe, and Brad Pitt is arguably his most idiosyncratic role of his career. This film is set 2035 when a deadly virus has devastated nearly all of the human race and animals have dominated the Earth. As a result, this disaster has force mankind to live underground. Prisoner James Cole (played by Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1990 in efforts to hunt down an evil group known as the Twelve Monkeys who are believed to the masterminds behind the pandemic that is set spread worldwide in 1996. When he is unexpectedly thrown in a mental institute by Dr. Kathryn Railly (played by Madeleine Stowe), he crosses paths with a mentally unstable Jeffrey Goines (played by Brad Pitt) who appears to have a key to stopping the virus.Terry Gilliam is without a doubt deeply ambitious when it comes to breathing life to his unique vision. From his steampunk-like production design (particularly in the underground world), to the engrossing screenplay by Chris Marker, to the white-knuckle storytelling; this film fulfills just nearly everything, if not everything to excel as an electrifying science-fiction experience. This all begins with a dark premise of a deadly pandemic that places mankind on the doomsday agenda, and instead of driving for the plot into an action-heavy territory, Terry Gilliam places time travel in the mix. Although supplementing time travel in plots is a daunting task often resulting an overwhelming number of plot threads throwing the story in a convoluted romp. Fortunately, Gilliam engineers the plot in a way that is complex, yet solidly makes sense. Though the story occasionally slips into some questionable areas mostly during the second act, Gilliam more than knows how to keep things moving. Following Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe on the run after the evil doers who threaten the future of mankind, and throughout the picture we are hit nearly non-stop twists and turns including James Cole's nightmarish hallucinations to leave us guessing who's good and who's evil, and what is real and what is not real. When the equation is made up, the film brilliantly achieves the thrills audience deserve.When thinking of Bruce Willis, the first role that may come to your head is when he was facing against the twelve German terrorists in the Nakatomi Plaza as John McClane in 'Die Hard'. This film marks an unique role of him as he carries the lead role of James Cole with astounding charisma and humanity. Yes, while it is less light-heart role than John McClane but by the end, it is safe to say that he delivers the role with clear ambition. Supporting along his side Madeleine Stowe as the psychiatrist Kathryn Railly who becomes a helping hand after realizing his out-of-whack claims of the threat of mankind on the horizon become dangerously true as the two stroll on. Like Willis, Stowe gracefully accomplishes a solid performance to make for an engaging character. Each time these two are on screen together, it is almost instantly enthralling. There is almost no doubt however, that the star who greatly stands out above them is Brad Pitt as the mentally rocky patient Jeffrey Goines who pops in and out of the story as a key character of the diabolical plot. Pitt cashes a manic vibe as the mentally unstable patient who displays an unusual behavior that strolls between the line of comedic and eyebrow-raising insanity. And Pitt spears the role through his jittery dialogue and bombastic demeanor. What results is a fascinating character that swipes your attention each time he appears on screen.Twelve Monkeys is an exhilarating dystopian, science-fiction thrill ride polished by the outstanding vision of director Terry Gilliam. And for lovers of the science-fiction genre, it is a film that expands upon the boundaries of the dystopian subgenre. By the end, it feels like classic, if not a souring masterpiece.",9,1,2,26 December 2016
Argo," Ben Affleck's briskly-paced, suspense-driven testament on the stranger-than fiction historical events prove him as versatile filmmaker
","Argo is a film that suitably fits in the category of films that tackle real-life events and captures them with electrifying precision and grit, and it is Ben Affleck who is taking the director's chair. With 2007's 'Gone Baby Gone' and 2010's 'The Town' stamped on his resume, Affleck proves himself as a filmmaker fueled with astonishing directorial virtuosity It is little to no wonder he was the perfect choice of this political thriller, a briskly-paced, suspense-driven rendition of the stranger-than-fiction real-life event that marked an unlikely collaboration with Hollywood and the U.S government in effort to execute one of the most daring rescue missions performed in history. The central role of the film is the Iran Hostage Crisis of 1979-1981, a world-rocking event that not only marked the beginning of the blood-drenched tensions between the United States and the Middle East but shattered with distressing effects that still linger today. Of course, like most cinematic interpretation of historical events, the film is not empty of wielding creative liberties at the expense of significant historical accuracy. Affleck's depiction of the event has been held in the crossfire of controversary, with many deeming it as either exaggerated or fabricated from what really took place. However, that is nothing to take away from how grippingly entertaining it is. Set during the final decade of the Cold War, Affleck takes the lead role of Tony Mendez, a CIA agent who was approached by the agency to rescue six Americans who were hostage in the U.S Embassy in Tehran, Iran in 1979 in the heat of a political uprising before taking refuge at the home of the Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor (played by Victor Garber). Knowing that they would eventually be found and captured to be taken in public execution if they stayed there any longer, Mendez collaborated with Hollywood producer Lester Siegal (played by Alan Arkin) and make-up artist John Chambers (played by John Goodman) came up with a plan that was far out of the ordinary: pose as a Hollywood producer under a fake name and disguise the hostages as his film crew in search for location to shoot a fake science-fiction movie titled 'Argo' in an effort to sneak them through an airport ran by angry-faced, gun-wielding guards. Intertwining the story is his supervisor Jack O'Connell (played by Bryan Cranston) who along with his colleagues keep contact with Mendez during his dangerous mission. Curious to what the Iranian revolution was about? It was about rebelling against the Pahlavi dynasty under the ruling of Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi who was upheld by President Jimmy Carter. Swiping from the pages of the Tony Mendez's memoir 'The Master of Disguise' and Joshuah Bearman's memoir 'The Great Escape', this film, written by Chris Terrio, paints an authentic picture of the real-life events while appropriately masquerading as a tension-fueled race-against-the-clock thriller defies against the typical tropes of an espionage thriller. Ben Affleck shows he has an ambitious eye for detail and a heart for a palpable atmosphere that plays a major role in delivering the emotional touch for each scene taking place within the violent, dirty, socially unrest environment of Iran. He effectively lands the look of a period set in 70s and early 80s, and the intertwining of archive footage of President Jimmy Carter and news footage help set both the political and emotional tone. He also bravely exhibits with talent in front of the camera with a performance that, while proficient, doesn't quite mark one of his most memorable roles. It is his directorial efforts that takes the crown. He proves himself capable of staging each scene with a vivid eye for detail, and his effort pay off especially well for the final thirty minutes when Tony Mendez must lead the hostages through an airport where Iranian guards are watching with bold eyes, locked and loaded. The entire scene, crafted with captivating, you-are-there hand-held cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto, scorches with suspense as the atmosphere boils with arresting fear of what will happen if they get caught. On the other hand, there are moments of levity offered by John Goodman and Alan Arkin in scenes showing their time at the Hollywood studios as well as moments of their collaboration with Ben Affleck with their running gag line 'Argo f**k yourself'. Argo is an electrifying, tautly crafted political thriller that bears powerful evidence that Ben Affleck holsters plenty of talent behind the camera as much as in front of the camera, perhaps even more so. The film is entertaining, smart, and rarely bears a dull moment. If the fictional liberties of the event don't bother you, you are in for a gripping, if not remarkable cinematic ride. In conclusion, it stands tall as one of 2012's best motion pictures.",9,0,1,20 December 2017
Green Room," Extremely violent, gory but wildly exhilarating from beginning to end
","Director Jeremy Saulnier exercises high pressure suspense and astonishing realism in this white-knuckle thriller following his surprising success with the ultra-violent 'Blue Ruins'. Though it doesn't fall deep in the category of originality or even groundbreaking in any sense, the intriguing fashion in which Saulnier executes this film and the immersive cinematography by Sean Porter used to capture the harrowing intensity and gloomy visuals result in a highly effective slasher treat; and even labeling the results effective feels like an understatement. While the shocking level of bloody violence and gore more than not make this tough sit-through, especially for the weak stomach; Saulnier pervades a true sense of realism in a way in which the film never feels exploitative, but wildly authentic. So this film follows a punk rock band consisting of twenty-something year olds including lead singer Tiger (played by Callum Turner), guitarist Sam (played by Alia Shawkat), bassist Pat (played by Anton Yelchin), and drummer Reece (played by Joe Cole). When the band is offered a gig by a radio host named Tad, they find themselves performing at nowhere other than an old bar run by neo-Nazi skinheads. After a successful performance, the band and their friend Amber (played by Imogen Poots) rushes out to their green room where they witness a murder by the hands of a sadistic skinhead. In fear of being held responsible for the murders, skinhead leader Darcy Banker (played by Patrick Stewart) arrives an orders his gangs to eliminate the witnesses, leading the band to a bloody fight for survival.Jeremy Saulnier grants this intensely violent thriller with a gift to not only leave viewers shocked and squirming in their seats, but present an atmosphere so visceral to the point of giving viewers the feeling of not watching a gruesome slasher, but a real-life event unfolding on camera; and the scariest aspect of this film how brutally realistic it turns out on screen. Saulnier does such an amazing job on capturing the brutal intensity of each moment as the characters desperately battle their way through a violent bloodbath against a gang of white supremacists that threaten their young lives, and the camera work done by Sean Porter makes for great use to capture these dreadful moments. At various moments, the film intensifies to the point where you may constantly remind have to yourself you are not trapped inside the bar with the characters. While Saulnier's execution and Sean Porter's cinematography do justice, they only make up the half of the equation. The latter half is successfully achieved by Saulnier's screenplay. Instead of relying on the usual slasher horror stereotypes like the jock, the pot smoker, or the hot chick, Saulnier populated the film with characters that feel very believable and the dialogue these characters deliver more often than not feels typical to real-life college kids, thus adding to the insane realism. While the performances the actors are decent, the biggest stand out by far is Patrick Stewart, suiting the role of the main antagonist. Stewart gives a truly haunting performance as what is a major departure from his usual typecast. Though his character is limited to do nothing but giving orders, the portrayal Stewart lands as this character truly hits hard.Green Room is an exhilarating slasher-horror thriller with a constant sense of fright and thrills, making it one of the most spine-chilling horror films to be released in recent years. Though the extreme violent and realistic depiction of gore can may make this one a difficult sit-through, it is a must-see for all horror fans.",9,43,73,26 September 2016
The Babadook," Twisted and spine-chilling thriller you shouldn't watch alone
","This Austrailian horror-thriller follows Amelia (Essie Davis), a widowed mother who's husband was killed in a car crash, and is struggling trying to raise her six-year-old son Sam (Noah Wiseman), who has violent tantrums and copes with an extreme fear of monsters under his bed. One night, when she reads him book titled 'The Babadook', about a mysterious figure that lurks at night. Amelia and her son become endangered when 'The Babadook', the mysterious character from the book, comes to life and unleashes an unimaginable terror in their house. This film was directed and written by Jennifer Kent in her directorial debut.The Badadook is by far the scariest movie I've seen since The Conjuring (2013). It left me at the edge of my seat for awhile. Instead for relying on cheap jump scares that most horror films nowadays are known for, this film goes for straight horror by constantly building up suspense so that it will leave you slowly backing away from the screen. It does take away awhile (maybe 45 minutes) for all the scares to arrive, but when they happen, it immediately sends chills to your spine. The Babadook, which is this eerily dark figure with a coat and a hat, is the scariest part of the film. In the scene when it slowly emerges from the dark and scares Amelia and her son, my heart just started pounding. This scene was so creepy and unnerving to the point where I felt the Babadook was gonna come out jump at me. Then you have Amelia, who becomes possessed by the grotesque figure and begins exhibiting nightmare-ish behavior, like vomiting blood and screaming unnaturally. This film just took me by a surprise at every turn.The Babadook is truly one of the scariest of this decade. If you are a fan of horror films, this would be the best choice. However, don't watch it alone. Find a friend or a family member like a brother, sister, or cousin to watch this with. This is a really frightening movie, especially when you're by yourself.",9,5,9,22 July 2015
Ted," Seth MacFarlane and Mark Wahlberg splash their comedic energy in this vulgar, yet devilishly funny buddy comedy
","Comedy fanatics can always count on Seth MacFarlane, creator of the hit animated series 'Family Guy', to put on a good show, even his raunchy humor may not be your cup of tea. This movie, marking his first major film debut, takes his patent for vulgar humor and audacious delivery of crass innuendos and cranks up a notch with this story concerning a friendship between a man and a furry childhood friend with the mouth of a sailor. That childhood friend happens to be a talking teddy bear. For a movie featuring a cuddly little toy as a faithful companion, you would believe if you are in for a kid-friendly treat. But as this is Seth MacFarlane working behind the camera, this raunchy comedy is anything but that. It is an exercise of crude, R-rated humor and profane dialogue complete with innuendos that put the humor in 'Family Guy' to shame. Ultimately, it is funny and infectiously charming to the point where it is only expected to keep you laughing almost consistently. This film follows John Bennett (played by Mark Wahlberg), a 35-year old man who shares an apartment with his foul-mouthed, pot-smoking teddy bear named Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) who he brought to life as a result of wishing upon a star when he was a child. When their infectious friendship, however, threatens to come between his relationship with his longtime girlfriend Lori (played by Mila Kunis), he must decide how to balance his their friendship while maintaining a good relationship with the woman of his dreams. There is plenty of joy to be found in Mark Wahlberg crashing on the couch with a talking teddy bear while smoking pot and trading profane one-liners about sex and drugs. If there is anything that hinders in your one's enjoyment in these scenes, it is, of course, Seth MacFarlane's tendency of pushing the envelop with his vulgarity, his frequent excess of four-letter words, and cracking jokes on some occasionally sensitive subject matter. Nonetheless, this movie fully embraces the audacious comedic spirit MacFarlane granted in the 'Family Guy' series. And when it comes it the chemistry between the titular character and Mark Wahlberg, that is where the film peaks. Wahlberg, who has done a few comedic roles in the past such as 'The Other Guys', shows off with his infectious comedic muscle that greatly pays off in nearly each scene he comes on screen. He is also given a chance to show his serious side when the story dives into more dramatic territory which involves the crisis between his relationship with Mila Kunis. This portion of the plot is perhaps the lesser element of the story as it serves the purpose of giving the cast some time to breath from the consistent comedic absurdity that fills the air. Nonetheless, Wahlberg and MacFarlane succeed on delivering the laughs almost consistently. Sure, there are a few jokes that fall flat. But that is only occurs few and far in between. Ted is a wildly funny and entertaining enough keep viewers, particularly those of the Seth MacFarlane fandom, engaged from beginning to end. It is also very vulgar and crude to point of taking its R-rating to its peak. In this case, the conservative crowd will be left in an uncomfortable position. But for everyone else, it scores a fun, laugh-out-loud exercise.",9,1,1,21 June 2015
127 Hours," Danny Boyle's intense, thought-provoking account on the true story of a man's survival is not just outstanding, but simply spellbinding to its core
","One thing 2008's Oscar Winner 'Slumdog Millionaire' proved is that Danny Boyle is a man with a directorial gift pounding with a force to reckoned with. And that only makes up a majority of the reason of why the English director makes a marvelous choice to take the fascinating true story of Aron Ralston and energize it to life with electrifying precision. The story of Aron Ralston, a man who in 2003, faced an unfortunate situation during his exploration in a beautiful sunny desert that left him crippled from the world before making a difficult decision that most people would think, perhaps more times, about doing. The man's story of survival is brought to the screen with such powerful energy and a magnetic performance by lead James Franco it isn't too far below what could almost be considered a masterpiece. While that may be saying a lot, it is only an expression how admirable Boyle and Franco prove to make a good team when honoring the survival of a man who fought against near impossible odds. Set in 2003, James Franco plays Ralston, a man living in southern Utah who takes a hiking trip in the Blue John Canyon. Exploring the wonders of the land and running into two women (played by Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) who he goes for a swim with before departing, his trip starts off as a dream come true. That is until he takes a nasty spill down a canyon followed a boulder that pins his arm against the wall. Trapped with his arm completely incapacitated and unable to move to the boulder even an inch, Ralston must do everything he can to survive. As the titles claims, the subject character is trapped for an astonishing amount of time, and the cruel assault to injury is that he has no food or water and is forced to resort to drinking his urine. Danny Boyle brings the harrowing account of the poor man's desperate survival to vigorous authenticity, and does so without resorting to exploitative territory. Boyle boasts extraordinary effort to inject liveliness and subtly into the central figure's fight for survival, while appointing James Franco with the daring task of carrying the film on his shoulders. To remarkable effort, Franco proves tremendous in this task, electrifying his role with both energy and soul, particularly in the more emotional-driven bits where he reminises about his family. Collaborating with Boyle once again is Anthony Dod Mantle who boasts absorbing camera work to tightly capture the claustrophobic atmosphere of Aron Ralston's severely cramped environment, and not before soaring the camera around the desert to capture the warming beauty of the Blue John Canyon. And when the film eventually stations its focus on Ralston suffering his unpleasant predicament, every grueling detail of his misery is powerfully apprehended on both visual and emotional scope. This feat also brings out the nightmare feasting on audiences' eyes during the incredibly gruesome finale when Ralston makes an almost unimaginable decision, and if you are familiar with the story, you know how it ends; and the only strongest of stomach would be in the safest capacity to withstand the brutality of this scene. Again, the deeper the film travels into detail, the more riveting it gets as it paints an unforgettable picture of a man who's will to survive outwitted the pain he endures.127 Hours is an intense, riveting, and an astoundingly thought- provoking testament on its true-story-based subject. It is a fascinating account on its central figure, carrying an amazing amount of gravity and liveliness only Danny Boyle is capable of establishing. While not the most uplifting picture, it is one that many can deeply admire, especially with the appeal of James Franco at hand.",10,0,1,24 September 2015
Superbad," Funny, subversive, and surprisingly authentic take on high school life
","With Judd Apatow in the producer's chair, and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg as the writers, comedy fans are almost guaranteed for a hilarious, raucous experience. This comedy directed by Greg Mottola sets a funny and surprisingly realistic take on life as a high schooler and the utter debauchery that teenagers engage in to have the time of their lives while their days of drinking and partying like animals are numbered. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera play Seth and Evan (named after the writers), two high school seniors who have been the best of friends for a long time and are dealing with separation anxiety as they are anticipating their last school year together before moving off to separate colleges. With no party plans on their agenda, Seth and Evan are invited to a party hosted by their crushes Jules (played by Emma Stone) and Becca (played by Martha MacIsaac). But there is just one thing: they need booze. This is a problem since the fact that they are not 21 but luckily they get help from their geeky friend Fogell (played by Christopher Mintz- Plasse) who obtains fake IDs to mask themselves as of legal age. However, their mission to get to the party with booze becomes difficult when they face seemingly endless array of difficulties including Fogell's run-in with two amateur cops Officer Slater (played by Bill Hader) and Officer Michaels (played by Seth Rogen) who slow their plans down.Teen comedies typically come in two different categories, one is a comedy where teenagers are involved in situations that are plausible in reality but typically don't happen outside of Hollywood films. Then there is a small minority of comedies that veer closer to reality, and this film sits more toward this category. This film written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg who were only 13 years old at the time they wrote this, blossoms an insanely funny, clever, and unlike most comedies, an authentic take on high school experience thanks to its smart script. The plot sets a fair demonstration of just about everything a high school boy fantasized about when it came to making his way into the popular crowd, ranging from losing his virginity to the girl of his dreams, to getting his hands on booze, to going to a party for a wild night of drinking, sex, and dancing to loud music; many thing teens and adults can relate to. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are both hilarious as their characters, and have plenty of funny (and vulgar) dialogue for the most of their time on screen. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is also quite funny and equally likable, especially during his moments with Seth Rogen and Bill Hader playing police officers. Their comedic chemistry together hits home and serves as a pinnacle of endless laughter as much as Jonah Hill and Michael Cera, plenty of vulgar sex jokes typical for the Judd Apatow fare here and there, most of the hit well while a few are a bit misfires. While these actors are funny, they also show a fair side of sweetness and smarts, particular when they come to clever terms with the girls of their dreams. Superbad is super-funny, super-smart, and show Jonah Hill and Michael Cera at arguably their comedic talents. This movie makes a good pick for any comedy fans looking for a funny and subversive experience in a high school setting. Of course, this film is probably not for everyone, particularly those who don't bode well with raunchy humor and vulgar- filled humor by teenagers. Otherwise, this film is worth watching.",9,0,1,12 April 2016
Brokeback Mountain," Ang Lee's emotionally complex story of homosexuality is powerfully crafted and deeply moving
","Director Ang Lee's period piece is the home of a powerful love story, but definitely not the kind of love story Hollywood is richly experienced in. It is the love story between two cowboys who both happen to be men. Homosexuality has often stood as one of the most sensitive subject matter has Hollywood as ventured, especially when becoming the target of outcry from the conservative community. In fact, some may be familiar with numerous reports of communities fighting unsuccessfully to ban the film from theaters. Nonetheless, above the predictable controversy is a masterful crafted romantic tale that sees Ang Lee showcasing a trials and tribulations of a relationship that is often frowned upon by many, and the dangers that ensue from the fear of homophobic crowd. It is a tragic, it is complex, and at times, deeply frustrating. But ultimately, it is story that is difficult to forget. The film opens up in 1963 in Brokeback mountain of Wyoming. Two cowboys Jack Twist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) are hired by Joe Aguirre (played by Randy Quaid) for a summer job at herding the sheep. The two start off as strangers before gradually becoming friends. But before the summer is over, the two develop a deep relationship with each other. When is summer is over, the two are forced to part ways where Ennis marries Alma (played by Michelle Williams) and has children, and Jack falls in love with cowgirl named Lureen (played by Anne Hathaway). Nonetheless, their love each other still lingers When the two men reunite however, they are forced to deal with the tragic hardships of their forbidden relationship. Classifying this 'Romeo and Juliet'-like romantic drama as a 'gay cowboy movie' is somewhat accurate, but does feel slightly of a overstatement. The main pinnacle of this film is not just the relationship between these two men but the journey of these men questioning their sexuality when they both get wrapped up in the lives of family. The tragedy sees men face soon serves as the emotional crux of the plot. When the two go their separate ways, they both enter a relationship with a women they believe is their true love, but struggle trying to cope with the possibilities that still have feelings for each other. When the two men cross paths again, the two fall victim to tragedy as they struggle to hide their contraband relationship not only from their families but all of society. Ang Lee powerfully illustrates the pain and frustration of these men fighting to adjust to a society where homosexuals are constantly slipping into the cracks of maltreatment, an issue that still remained brutally relevant in America for the last several decades. Spanning across a course of twenty years, this showcases an incredibly powerful journey these men endure on keeping their relationship alive, and the results lead to an emotional roller-coaster that doesn't waste the capacity to make viewers shed tears in the final stretch.While Ang Lee's portrayal of this tragic is deeply riveting from his direction, to the elegantly crafted writing, this movie would not likely strike at the heart without the riveting performances of an inspiring cast. That is where Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger come in. Jake Gyllenhaal takes on arguably the most challenging role of his career, playing a cowboy who finds himself enigmatic by his sexuality when he crosses paths with Heath Ledger. He is incredibly diligent in his role and packs a strong emotional punch nearly every minute he is on screen. Standing his side is Heath Ledger who takes on an equally bold endeavor in the role as his lover, and is brilliantly convicted in his role. The chemistry between the two is shockingly subtle, if a bit uncomfortable for conservative moviegoers. The thick southern accents these two adopt also deserves a round of credit. Supporting the romantic duo is Michelle Williams who serves a character struck with tragedy when she learns about the shocking relationship between the two men. Anne Hathaway makes for a pleasant appearance, at least for the short amount of time she has on screen. Kate Mara gives a swell performance in her role as Heath Ledger's daughter, which may come off a slightly unusual considering the very short age gap between her and Ledger. Brokeback Mountain is an emotionally complex, yet powerful love story with astonishing performances and an inspiring craftsmanship by Ang Lee. This film is a rare cinematic gold that not only sheds light on the painful, yet honest truth of same-sex love, but defies against the overwhelming controversy driven by its contentious subject matter. While there is certainly no doubt that the material will send people of the conservative crowd running for the hills, it is an absorbing cinematic art that many others will come to appreciate.",10,5,7,29 April 2017
Spotlight," Spotlight is deeply engrossing and gripping from start to finish
","This film, directed and written by Tom McCarthy and co-written by Josh Singer, follows an engrossing retelling of the Boston Globe and their attempt to expose a massive scandal in 2001 that shocked the entire nation as well as the Catholic Church to its core. With a powerful screenplay and direction, this film based on true events, deals with newly hired news editor Marty Baron of the Boston Globe (played by Liev Schreiber) who assembles a team of journalists to uncover the massive child molestation scandal by committed priests of Catholic Churches that has run rampant throughout the nation, and to matters worse, has been kept a secret for many decades. This team includes Michael Rezendez (played by Mark Ruffalo), Sasha Pfeiffer (played by Rachel McAdams), Matt Carroll (played by Brian D'Arcy James), Ben Bradlee Jr. (played by John Slattery), and their leader Walter Robinson (played by Michael Keaton). This movie dramatizes the team's investigation into these child sex abuse cases occurring and their attempt to shine their light on them to the public.This film touches a very heavy subject as far as the plot goes, and Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer bring powerful appeal to the horrifying story this film revolves around. Telling the story in a fact-based manner, this film grips audiences into a dark and dramatic story, hitting the major key points of the events that were going on at the time; and doesn't attempt to over dramatize nor sugarcoat the events that made both national and international headlines. It is doesn't portray the story in a sense of heroism. What comes of this is a story that operates on a honest, solid level as well as an authentic inside look of what goes on behind the newsroom. McCarthy and Singer bless with this film with such incredible writing, and the story moves at an even pace. The entire story behind the Boston Globe as well as the stories dealing with the child abuse cases are both intriguing, yet deeply affecting. The emotional intensity is conveyed not just by the story or the actors' performances, but the thoughts it leaves viewers with of how people were going to Church to hear these priests preach the gospel but were unaware of the harrowing activity going on behind the stage. There is plenty of emotional and heart-tapping scenes throughout the picture, most of which take place when the characters are interviewing the various victims and discussing in explicit detail of their experiences, but nonetheless strengthens the interest in the story for viewers, whether they are familiar with the events or not. Mark Ruffalo really hits home with his performance, by far his most powerful performance he has given in his career. Rachel McAdams and Michael Keaton are also very creditable here too. McAdams who gave diligence to her role in sports drama 'Southpaw' earlier in the year, and Michael Keaton who impressed audiences and critics everywhere in last year's Oscar winning picture 'Birdman', are both very natural in their roles and are definitely Oscar-worthy for their performances. The rest of the cast including Stanley Tucci and Billy Cruddup who play the attorneys also deserve a round of applause for their acting here. Spotlight is one of the best films of 2015, and something to definitely watch for during this year's Academy Awards ceremony. Many films based on true events do not come as superb and interesting as this one. It is deeply engrossing and gripping from the start, and utterly thought- provoking that it will likely lead to serious discussions after viewing.",10,2,4,18 January 2016
Insomnia," Insomnia is both original and thrilling, and soars with great writing
","Insomnia does not mark the first time director Christopher Nolan uproots a highly original concept and brings it to life on screen, nor does it mark his last. With the astonishing success with the innovative neo-noir thriller 'Memento' the previous year, it was easy to see Nolan had a solid career ahead of him. He's a man who's makes decent acquaintance with originality, from powerful story lines, to absorbing characters, to enthralling thrills for audience to feed on. This psychological thriller starring acclaimed actor Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, Martin Donovan, and Robin Williams in a role unlike any of the charismatic characters he's swallowed in his career; showcases a true and fascinating demonstration of what Nolan is capable of, even if it's quality leads less memorable than his other efforts. The film enters the 'Scarface' veteran Al Pacino as Los Angeles homicide detective Will Dormer who's assigned on a case with his partner Hap Eckhart (played by Martin Donovan) to investigate the murder of 17-year old girl Kay Connell in a small town in Northern Alaska where the daylight sustains uninterrupted for two months. The continuous daylight interferes with Dormer's ability to sleep, leading his insomnia that soon pays a toll his mental state during the investigation. When his attempted apprehension of the killer (played by Robin Williams) goes wrong, it pins Alaskan detective Ellie Burr (played by Hilary Swank) on a separate homicide investigation while Dormer struggles to catch the criminal as he must fight against the psychological deterioration.This psychological thriller isn't your average catch-the-villain story, Christopher Nolan presents the story with gripping psychological elements associated with suspenseful resonance. The story doesn't dwell on typical crime component like shootouts and tense car chases, instead it showcases a brooding psychological character study as it ventures through the main character's struggle in capturing the antagonist from his mental degradation including the symptoms such as hallucinations and impaired physical functions associated with his disorder. This illness plays a key role in the plot, and the film doesn't go out without a fair plethora of thrills. Christopher Nolan drives the plot through a stylish execution that awards viewers with plenty of tight-on suspense and awe-inspiring thrills from start to finish. Very rarely is there a predictable moment. If there is anything that comes more surprising than the twists and turns sprinkled throughout the 119 minutes, it is the confound performance by Robin Williams as the manipulative (yet somehow likable) primary antagonist. Though Al Pacino serves as the pinnacle of the story, Williams comes to the biggest surprise as playing a character on the opposite side of the moral compass, far from the good guy roles many are used to seeing the fine actor in. He makes great memorability for a character with a sinister and complex agenda. Al Pacino and Oscar- winner Hilary Swank are both solidly appreciable in their roles. Nothing surprising but certainly nothing to ignore.Insomnia is an inspiring and captivating psychological thriller with ingenious performance, engrossing thrills, and a smartly executed plot formulated by the efforts of director Chrisother Nolan. The film is more than just a reminder of why Christopher Nolan is such an influential filmmaker he is today, it is a thriller with both inventiveness and smarts that defined a true cinematic arks of it's genre.",8,0,0,23 July 2016
Concussion," An engrossing biopic with something to learn
","Football is embraced as one of America's most popular sports, and for many decades; has lead many of America's biggest athletes to fame. Not many people, however, are aware of the dangers that lie within this sport when a player is tackled and suffers a head injury. This is the crucial subject this biopic directed by Peter Landesman (Parkland, Kill The Messenger) dwells upon. Inspired by true events set in 2002, this film follows the story of Dr. Bennett Omalu (played by Will Smith), a Nigerian forensic pathologist in Pittsburgh who discovered a neurological disease known as CTE (Chronic traumatic encephalopathy) -- a disease suffered by players as a result from multiple head traumas on the field, when performing an autopsy on former football star Mike Webster (played by David Morse). Supported by county corner Cyril Wecht (played by Albert Brooks), Omalu made his mission to shine light on his research to the public to present them with this disease, but found himself at serious odds with the NFL who looked down upon his research. This biopic drama dives into a fascinating topic that football fans can relate to, though its not always as compelling as it should be. What the film does best is paint a clear picture of who this doctor was. In the beginning of the movie, we are introduced to Dr. Bennett Omalu who is shown to be intelligent with multiple college degrees, but is looked down by his colleagues for his unorthodox ways of working, talking to his patients during operations in particular. When Omalu discovers the brain damaging disease, the story gradually grabs your attention and digs deeper into the subject while transcending into a somber atmosphere. The mental effects of the disease is exhibited in great detail with former football stars who begin suffering. When Omalu and his colleague Cyril Wecht start fighting to expose the truth to the public, that is when your mind is left flooded with questions. You began connecting with the story is questioning whether Omalu was trying to make football pictured as an villain, or condemn the NFL for keeping the dangers a secret from the public. This entire portion of the story is when the film tends to falter in terms of pacing. At various points, the story tends to lose appeal for a while, but eventually picks back up towards the end.Will Smith is one of those actors stood high on the A-list before eventually starring his some bad roles (After Earth for an example) that put him on the sidelines of Hollywood's A-list. Here, he gives the most genuine performance I have seen in a long time. Smith strikes surprising diligence in the role of Dr. Bennett Omalu with a thick Nigerian accent. and strong emotional investment, making his character very believable. Alec Baldwin and Albert Brooks are also spectacular in their roles, and put fair effort into their characters. Guga Mbatha- Raw as Omalu's fiancée should also not be forgotten for her endearing performance. Concussion may be not be the best of Director Peter Landesman's works, but it is an engrossing and thought-provoking drama with a compelling subject that will lead to some serious discussions and leave people with crucial thoughts when they watch football whether they are watching it live on TV or watching a family member play. The messages the film delivers may be found iffy or somewhat debatable for some, but doesn't mean this film couldn't use a viewing.",7,2,6,24 January 2016
The Day After Tomorrow," The miraculous special effects are the primary saving grace of this preposterous disaster extravaganza
","Roland Emmerich of 'Independence Day' fame has come up with a new disaster tale, and the primary theme is global warming. This thought-provoking phenomenon is an issue that has raised concern for many people around the globe, while others have boldly dismissed it has a scientific hoax. This big-budget disaster vehicle hosts a wide plethora of extravagant special effects to breath life into a catastrophic, doomsday scenario that is believed to be a global treat resulting from climate change. Although the effects of global warming can understandably lead to disastrous consequences, Emmerich's interpretation of the supposed disaster her is a bit exaggerated. Aside from the cookie-cutter characters and cheesy dialogue, this film definitely falls shallow of scientific accuracies -- to the point of making the supposed disaster scenario preposterous. While Emmerich somewhat succeeds on unleashing the thrills, it definitely requires a strong suspension of disbelief to get past how absurd this movie escalates. So this film stars Dennis Quaid as Jack Hall, a climatologist who discovers the polar ice caps melting, and alarms the government that the disappearance in the ice caps will cause the massive flooding and send the world into a second Ice Age. When President Raymond Baker (played by Kenneth Walsh) along with the United Nations dismiss his claims, Hall's terrifying claims come to life when a series of cataclysmic disasters including blizzards, hurricanes, and tornadoes erupt around the globe, killing millions. With the United States flooded and covered in ice and his 17-year old son Sam (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) trapped inside a library in New York. Hall must sprawl across the now-frozen America to save him.Whether or not Roland Emmerich is trying to deliver a cautionary tale to those skeptical about global warming is certainly debatable, but it is difficult to believe that this film will slap viewers with a sense of urgency to take action against the proposed threat when Emmerich's execution of the disaster is overblown. Opening with the 20th Century Fox logo dominated by a lightening storm under a dark, cloudy sky, this movie introduces a fairly fascinating premise revolving around the concept of climatic change. The story sets off on a decent note to say the least. But when the disaster sequences arrive, that is when things begin to derail. The opening disasters featuring Los Angeles desecrated by tornadoes and New York flooded with a massive tsunami are thoroughly exciting to sit through and demonstrate the film's biggest strength -- special effects. The destruction of major landmarks including the Hollywood sign is nothing out of the ordinary in Emmerich's filmography, that doesn't mean it can't fun to watch. Aside from this, it is not long before the film tosses logic out the window and the story plunges into a wheelhouse of absurdity, especially when considering how excessively quick it takes for New York to be frozen into a series of ice sculptures (It would take several centuries for the global warming to actually trigger an ice age). Millions of people including some supporting characters perish throughout the debacle, but the story rarely invests in any emotional touch to make viewers care. If there is one thing the story remains remotely consistent on, it is the tension that fortunately pervades a good portion of the father-save-son plot. Speaking of performances, the cast here remains solid, but the flimsy dialogue and shortage of character development stand as a primary drawback.The Day After Tomorrow is a overblown disaster extravaganza that requires a good amount of suspension of disbelief to truly engage in. But if you are looking for a fun big-budget disaster flick to fuel your adrenaline, this one certainly delivers. But for those looking for something to engage in intellectually are better off looking elsewhere. Otherwise, this Roland Emmerich makes for an okay popcorn experience.",6,0,1,26 March 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Arguably the most daunting entry of the franchise, Thor: Ragnarok takes its titular hero to subversive heights, sending its trilogy to a stunning conclusion
","Where were Thor and Hulk during the drama of 'Captain America: Civil War'? This question is answered in this third and final chapter of the Thor trilogy. Going out with a bang, Thor: Ragnorak shows director Taika Watiti, the man behind the fairly underseen 'Hunt for The Wilder People', embracing the glamorous spirit of the eponymous Marvel Comics hero and exercising it with flying colors, while constructing the veins to the events of the upcoming 'Avengers: Infinity War'. And for the tasty extra, Hulk is in on this one, making for yet another opportunity to take the Avengers and cross them over with their film's shared universe. Following its predecessor 'Dark World', this second sequel improves upon its predecessor in many ways while adding something fresh to build upon an exciting special-effects-heavy thrill ride without dedicating too much time on establishing connections with the MCU. The concluding result is a whiplash of a superhero spectacle that competes with both 'Logan' and last summer's 'Wonder Woman' for the crown of superhero film of the year. Chris Hemsworth strikes back in his role as Thor who, along with his mischievous brother Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston), is warned by their father Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) of the escape of their estranged older sister Hela (played by Cate Blanchett), the God of Death who is set to wreck havoc on the realm of Asgard. Crashing on a mysterious planet run by an eccentric grandmaster (played by Jeff Goldblum), they cross paths with Asgard warrior Valkyrie (played by Tessa Thompson) and Thor's former ally Hulk (played by Mark Ruffalo) who is he forced to fight against in a gladiator battle. Together, they must build their alliance to make their way back to Asgard to bring down the evil Hela before it's too late. Explosively entertaining and compelling in its comic book roots, this third entry of Thor's stand-alone franchise boasts just about everything a cinematic rendition of the eponymous god of thunder should be. Visually arresting in its production design and action sequences is one of them but perhaps the least surprising considering the MCU's reputation on feasting the eyes of cutting special effects. It takes an uncompromising effort to build upon a franchise and make it fun as ever, let alone surpassing its predecessor's in the level of excitement. Ultimately, director Taika Watiti proves trustworthy. From the opening sequence of Thor battling against the fiery demon, to his arrival on the unknown planet, to the final battle against the villain Hela; audiences are strapped tightly for a wild ride. And this does not go without mentioning the cast taking the advantage of delivering laughs each time they get the chance. While the banter between Thor and Loki is as charming as ever, Mark Ruffalo's Hulk later comes into the picture to share an outrageous comedic chemistry with Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson that allows viewers to relish in the laugh-out- loud nature of its heroes. There is even a laugh-worthy moment with Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange who offers a nice unexpected cameo in an early scene. Jeff Goldblum has his funny gags here and there, but perhaps doesn't quite reach to the peak of the show stealer which belongs to Mark Ruffalo, especially as the story makes the clever decision of expanding upon his character arc which was neglected in previous incarnations. But what about Cate Blanchett? That's right. Stepping outside her usual good girl persona to portray the devious God of Death resembling more devilish-looking version of Maleficent, Blanchett shines the role with menacing intensity, a performance to audaciously defy against the her more human typecasting. Probably not a role who would expect to see Oscar nominated actress from 'Carol' in. Thor: Ragnarok weaves its franchise to a stunning conclusion while appropriately building a bridge to the upcoming Avengers sequel when all our heroes will be given their time to shine. This movie delivers one hell of a good time, securing its destiny to please fans and a small portion of non-fans of Marvel Cinematic Universe. With no surprise, box office gold is waiting in its path.",9,3,10,5 November 2017
Zodiac," Expertly crafted and electrified with scorching narrative complexity, Zodiac is a daring examination at the hunt for one of the most notorious serial killers
","The hunt for one of America's most infamous serial killers known as the Zodiac Killer is on, and David Fincher is the man to take the director's chair to bring this true story to sparkling colors. Zodiac is not a film that engages any typical serial killer conventions, it is part-police-procedural, part-mystery; both of which are blend together to generate an electrifying examination at the story following the San Francisco police department and their attempts at hunting down the criminal in a case that was sadly remained unsolved. If you know Fincher, you should expect that he doesn't believe in playing things straightforward. He, along with writer James Vanderbilt who adapts the script from the real-life detective involved Robert Graysmith, crafts the story with frequent narrative conundrums and shocking twists to leave the audience no more or no less puzzled than the lead character and the police detectives involved with the infamous case. With the story sprawling through the 1960s and 1970s, the film follows Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who comes involved with a string of murders perpetrated by an anonymous being known as the Zodiac Killer. With the San Francisco police department in pursuit, Graysmith along his fellow reporter Paul Avery (played by Robert Downey Jr.) cross paths with Detective David Toschi (played by Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (played by Anthony Edwards) as they pitted in a game of cat-and- mouse as the killer ignites an increasing body count and taunts them with encrypted messages that hold secrets the criminal's identity. David Fincher has a thoughtful eye for visual detail, and this powerfully demonstrated by his capture of 1960s (and eventually the 70s) San Francisco. From the vintage automobiles, to the production design, Fincher keeps things realistic as possible. But that is just the beginning of how the director puts his filmmaking pastiche on display, his methodology on taking the true crime story from pages of Robert Graysmith's memoir and bringing it to life is the real deal. Fincher tackles the mystery crime case with wild complexity that defies against conventional storytelling. The former half focuses on the steadily progressive bloodbath woven by the killer's twisted schemes before diving into the anxiety of the lead character and the police department as they are constantly played as puppets of the criminal's cryptic plan, and Fincher never lets his opportunities to breathing sheer suspense into the picture go to waste. With a solid barrage of hair-raising contorts, the man spins the plot into an enigmatic tale that requires us to question everything and drive use to point of throbbing our heads of with bold conspiracies. At the same time, he also builds upon an absorbing character study of the lead character as his increasing obsession with unmasking the killer not only puts a strain on his family but leaves with spun into a conspiracy- thumping craze. And Jake Gyllenhaal puts on a strong performance to weave energy in his role. Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo remain solid throughout, but perhaps nothing particularly grand in their cases. The best thing to say about the cast is most of everyone sustains throughout the picture. Zodiac is an expertly crafted mystery picture electrified with scorching narrative complexity and gripping suspense that dares to you guessing at very turn. For a best estimated target demographic, the film will most likely to please viewers who have the patience to withstand David Fincher's trickery for capturing the energy of the plot, especially with a lengthy runtime. For those who lack the patience, they certainly do not know what they are missing.",9,2,2,8 October 2017
Milk," A top-notch representation of one of America's most intolerant times
","Following the 1960s when America struck a chord with the Civil Rights Movement that helped fight against the prejudice against African-Americans, was the election of San Francisco's supervisor Harvey Milk, who made a name for himself when he became the first gay man in American history to take office as supervisor. This event made history during the years of when the homosexual community faced with mass intolerance from citizens left and right. Ranging from religious reasons, to outright insecurity of sexuality; citizens everywhere, particularly the Conservatives, found it difficult to bear homosexuals as functioning individuals of society, going as far as to call them 'rapists', 'child molesters', 'freaks', the list goes on. Many people feared these kinds of individuals were mortal threats to society. This engaging historical biopic directed by Gus Van Sant (Good Will Hunting) paints an awe-inspiring picture of the titular man's journey to making history in one of our country's most intolerant times, from his 40th birthday to his infamous assassination in 1978. Sean Penn plays Harvey Milk, a man from New York who moves to San Francisco, California with his lover Scott Smith (played by James Franco) where they witness extreme hostility against gay individuals by the hands of the public including the police force. Milk decides it's time to take a stand against society's bigotry and launches a movement in an outcry for equal rights. With young college kid Cleve Jones (played by Emile Hirsch) and Scott by his side, Milk runs for office and leads a fight to secure gay rights while facing conflict against Conservative attorney Dan White (played by Josh Brolin) and Senator John Briggs (played by Denis O'Hare).Unless you are a member of the LGBT community or lived in San Francisco during the 70s, there's a fair chance you're not familiar with Harvey Milk. But by many means, this biopic shines light on what made him one of the most influential political figures in the history of our country, and Gus Van Sant handles the story with realism and sincerity. Opening up with shots of archival news footage dealing with crime and brutality against the homosexual community, the movie gives a clear sneak peak of what we are getting into. We are then introduced to a barely recognizable Sean Penn and James Franco with a scraggly 70s hair style in 1970 when their two characters first meet and begin their intimate relationship. Their story continues in later years when they bear witness to the harsh maltreatment against the homosexual community as the population rapidly increases. These moments hit hard and paint a clear picture of the tyranny the gay community faced. From there on, Harvey Milk's story from his beginning days of activism to rise in the political ladder progress in an inspiring story. Gus Van Sant does a pleasant job of not only humanizing the characters of both sides of the central political issue, but handles the plot in a way that tells a compelling story without sparking tediousness by focusing more on the subject matter than the storytelling. The story hits many crucial spots including the outcry of the Christian community, the fight against the Preposition 6 that allowed schools to fire teachers who were found gay, and the complex relationship between Milk and attorney Dan White. And the thanks to Gus Van Sant'a execution, the story delivers with wit. Sean Penn and James Franco are tremendous in their roles, as is Josh Brolin as the titular character's rival. The cast gives the best of their talent to the point where you can't help to admire how committed these actors are. Milk is an outstanding historical biopic with an endearing performance by lead Sean Penn, and pays a great tribute to a man who made American history. Whether you agree with the political views of the titular figure or not, this film paints a great cinematic effort and brings it to life with Gus Van Sant's incredible direction. It is a film that is not powerfully presented, but falls astonishingly relatable of what still goes on today.",10,0,3,31 August 2016
The Prestige," Christopher Nolan's dark fantasy piece is smart, dazzling, but a little meandering
","The main purpose of magic is not to impress others nor to deceive them, but to simply give the illusion of something fake appear real for artistic purposes. That is lesson incorporated in this dark fantasy period piece starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as rival magicians in an intensifying battle to discover the truth of each other. Set with an intelligent, but convoluted plot and a visually alluring design of nineteenth century England, this movie sees director Christopher Nolan delivering his signature filmmaking tropes and bringing them together to form a dazzling mix of fantasy, suspense, and mystery elements in a story that like most of Nolan's works, drives with a fair amount of complexity and emotional twist; though suffers some occasional blemishes in the narrative department. Based on the novel by British author Christopher Priest, the film tells the story of Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Bordon (played by Christian Bale), two magicians who sustain a friendship as assistants for their town's magic shows run by master magician John Cutter (played by Michael Caine). But one night during a show, their performance goes terribly wrong that results in tragedy. The fateful event turns their duo's friendship into a bitter rivalry and soon leads to the two in an obsessive battle to discover each other's secrets. It's not long before their heated rivalry escalates into a downward spiral of deceit that threatens to not only tear apart their careers on stage, but their own personal beings. As this film deals with magic and sorcery, it should come to no surprise that Christopher Nolan brings a wide plethora of twists to the mix; and with a smoothly compelling script and striking visual resonance, Nolan appears to be at the top of his game. Wielding with spectacular directorial talent, Nolan drives this film with plenty of nuance and astounding visual potency. As the story revolves around a heated competition of revenge and deception that makes for some very dark and occasionally morbid moments, it pulls into a dark, eerie journey of Christopher Priest's novel with plenty of surprises supplemented by Nolan's stylish direction. Though the plot holds a fair amount of intelligence, the unnecessarily slow pacing does tend to kill the interest of the story. Instead of introducing the lead magicians at the beginning, the film proceeds through a non-linear narrative opening with Christian Bale's character Alfred on murder trail (for reasons you don't learn until later) which becomes intertwined throughout the story until the very end, before giving us the proper introduction on the characters. Along with this another subplot centering on famous inventor Nikola Tesla who's oddly played by singer David Bowie, trying to invent a teleporter. Nolan's use of non-linear storytelling not only overcomplicates the plot, but he doesn't execute in a way that is effective as what he achieved in 'Memento'. On the bright side, this director manages to keep things moving at least most of the time, and builds up the story up to a shocking, unpredictable conclusion. The performances by Christian Bale , fresh off of Nolan's 'Batman Begins', and Hugh Jackman both stand out; and the supporting cast including Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson as Robert Angier's assistant also make great appeal in their roles. While nothing particularly Oscar-worthy, these actors manage to fit the bill.The Prestige, though slightly inferior to Christoper Nolan's other works, is a smart, dazzling fantasy period piece with alluring energy of Nolan's directorial efforts and a fine array of charismatic performances by a likable cast. Though the level of complexity in the plot make the story a challenge for the most naive film goers to sit through, it also serves as a reminder of the fine cinematic talent Nolan never stops bringing to the screen.",7,1,1,11 September 2016
Cloverfield," Terrific found-footage thrill ride
","Directed by Matt Reeves and produced by J.J Abrams, this found-footage sci-fi thriller follows a group of friends who vacation to New York City for a going-away party for their friend Rob who is moving to Japan. The party is suddenly interrupted when the city becomes under attack by a giant monster, who destroys the Statue of Liberty and wrecks havoc to the city. When one of the friends' lover is trapped inside a building, they must sprawl across town in attempt to save her while surviving the massive monster mayhem that devastated the city. Featuring the cast of Michael-Stahl David, Lizzy Caplan, Jessica Lucas, T.J Miller, Jason Vogel, and Odette Annable, this Godzilla and Blair Witch Project mix packs a punch of brilliant special effects and immense scares and thrills, but is executed with shaky camera-work that can get frustrating at times.This film was met with critical attraction before its release with its poster showing the dismembered Statue of Liberty, which was also shown in the trailer. This film does succeed on living up to its hype. Director Matt Reeves succeeds on keeping this film moving and giving the script a vision. From the point when the monsters began attacking, the film showers with fantastic special effects and CGI with building collapsing and numerous explosions that leave the city devastated with massive debris, hencing a highly intense atmosphere with plenty of action that resemble the Godzilla movies to polish it. The audience awarded with some incredible thrills and edge-of-your-seat scares, as well as some occasional blood and gore that borders on the R rating. There are, however, some flaws that are worthy pointing, the shaky camera-work in particular. As this is found- footage film, the camera-work gets really shaky and often quite nauseating. It can be especially pesky for the action scenes, making it somewhat difficult to tell what is going on. Overall, it didn't take away from its eerie atmosphere too much.Cloverfield may not the best found-footage film, but certainly is one of them. However, I do not recommend this film to those who have grown despised of shaky camera-work. Otherwise, this film would make a good pick.",7,0,1,31 October 2015
Sleepy Hollow," Visually arresting dark tale is gory, but a clever piece by Tim Burton
","Embracing a dark, quirky vision and engaging characters from Washington Irving's novel 'The Legend of The Sleepy Hollow', this film sees Johnny Depp collaborating with director Tim Burton for another fantasy adventure, but with more blood and gore and less kid- friendly material than most of Burton's. With Burton taking place in the director's chair, it is only anticipated that the director captures his trademark macabre storytelling and Gothic visual atmosphere, take a look back at Burton's 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' for an example. As expected, this film embraces it beautifully, if a bit creepy. So the movie takes place in near the dawn of the 18th century where we witness a wealthy farmer, his son, and a widowed woman as they riding on a stagecoach in the middle of a dark field when they suddenly beheaded by the Headless Horseman (played by Christopher Walken). A New York City constable Ichabod Crane (played by Johnny Depp) is appointed by the government to travel out an old town of Sleep Hollows to investigate the grisly murders and bring the headless slayer to justice. Upon his investigation, he meets Katrina Can Vassel (played by Christina Ricci), the daughter of the wealthy townsman Baltas Van Tassel (played by Michael Gambon) who he gradually falls in love with. As the body count in the old town continues to rise, Ichabod is accompanied by Katrina and Masbath (played by Marc Pickering) to put an end to the Headless horseman's tyranny.This Tim Burton fantasy picture is with zero doubt creepy in both the visual and narrative department, not to mention quite gory as decapitations occur more often than a slasher flick by Wes Craven. Calling this a slasher movie set in the Victorian Age however, does a feel somewhat of an overstatement as this film's main element is visuals and storytelling than a plot of individuals getting picked off one by one. Nonetheless, there are definitely some scares to endure here as we experience some of Tim Burton's dark, creep trademark imagery, one of which includes a living tree filled with severed heads from the Headless Horseman's slayings. The visuals suite the story quite well and make up for the story's eerie atmosphere. The costume design and makeup, particularly done on Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane is dazzling and captures an accurate feel of the Victorian Age setting. The character development is fine, though the manner in which they are written give them a feel of more like caricatures than lively characters. Then again, this is Tim Burton we are talking about, and the slight quirkiness of the characters only deliver an appropriate feel for a Tim Burton picture. As Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane and Christina Ricci's character develop a relationship, we experience a romance that feels pretty weak than realistic. As a result, it is hard to buy into these two falling in alive, especially considering the heavy age gap between the actor and actress. Overall, the film's engaging, solidly paced storytelling make up for the flaws, with plenty of surprises and twists to experience. Sleepy Hollow is a visually arresting work of art by Tim Burton, one that is definitely worth checking out, but perhaps not for non-Tim Burton fans. This movie may plague with nightmarish imagery and gruesome violence, but it is done a genuine manner that never feels gratuitous or exploitative. In the end, Tim Burton's macabre storytelling, characters, and artistic visual aspect are certainly worth admiration.",7,1,1,3 August 2016
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Cold War espionage tale is challenging to follow, but boasts a superb craftsmanship from start to finish
","Tomas Alfredson's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy strays far from the familiarity of other spy films such as the James Bond franchise. This Cold War-set mystery piece sheds the treatment of tense gun shootouts, big-budget explosions and high-octane chase sequences in favor of a more authentic approach to the world of espionage. The story here follows a man with to hunt down the villain using his intellectual skills rather than high-tech gadgetry or firearms, and what transpires is a solidly complex, yet fascinating spy thriller. Taking from the pages of the novel of the same name by British writer John Le Carre, this historical fiction piece offers a layered story of paranoia and deceit that enlisted cultural relevance to the dark days of the Cold War during the 50s and 60s, and transcends into an enthralling tale where action is minimal but the suspense is high. Set in 1974, this film tells the story of MI6 agent Jim Prideaux (played by Mark Strong) who is assigned by head of the department Control (played by John Hurt) on a mission to Hungary. When the mission goes terribly wrong, Secretary Olive Lacon (played by Simon McBurney) learns that one of their agent is secretly working for the Soviet Union and hires retired agent George Smiley (played by Gary Oldman) to uncover the mole. With no one to trust but Agent Peter Gilliam (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley must use his intellect along with classified information by field agent Ricky Tarr (played by Tom Hardy) to uncover the traitor.Those who go into this flick expecting action and tensions in the veins of a James Bond movie are more than likely destined for disappointment. Inspired by John Le Carre's source material, this Tomas Alfredson-directed thriller opens light on more complicated world of international espionage that many films of the spy genre tend to embellish. Tomas Alfredson presents the film with both a narrative and visual compulsion that strengthens the authenticity of its Cold War climate, the latter of which involves incorporating a limited color palette of brown and gray in give each scene an old timely look from the 1970s. But it is the story that takes the crown on breathing life into the atmosphere. The film follows the lead character as he navigates for clues on who the informer is, and it journeys through a dense labyrinth of character explorations and twists that firmly build suspense for the final act. Everything moves at a significantly slow pace as the most of the action consists of characters engaging in long conversations. As tedious as it sounds, the long stretches of dialogue are actually what contribute to the blistering suspense that steadily pays off as twists and turns are frequently fired at us. It will keep you guessing until the end. While it is easy to grow exhausted by the over-sophistication of the plot, there are plenty of little surprises sprinkled throughout the stretch. Arguably one of the most celebrated aspects of this historical fiction piece comes from wide cast of A-list English actors who dominate the screen. Stepping in the lead role is Gary Oldman, known for his role as Jim Gordon in Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy boasts an emotionally stimulating performance in the role, easily one of the best performances he's displayed in his career. Standing by his side is Benedict Cumberbatch, the star of the television series 'Sherlock', who does a fair job as MIG agent Peter Gilliam. Simon McBurney also makes for an appealing on screen performance, but perhaps nothing too memorable. John Hurt does his job here as well, but his much of his memorability here is deflated by his short amount of screen time. Mark Strong, Tom Hardy, Toby Jones, Colin Firth, and Ciaran Hinds make the best of their limited screen time, nothing out of the ordinary. In the end, it is Oldman that stands out among the crowd with his performance. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a fascinating Cold War espionage vehicle empowered by a superb craftsmanship by Swedish director Tomas Alfredson as well as stellar performances from an inspiring cast. As engrossing as it is, the film is not an easy one to follow and could require a second viewing for the brain to compete with the narrative complexity. The film is itself may not be the groundbreaking entry in the spy genre it sets out to be, but it does great justice.",8,1,1,30 March 2017
The Hateful Eight," Audacious Tarantino western epic is bloody, but astonishingly engaging
","Quentin Tarantino began his career in the early 90s with the raw crime-thriller 'Reservoir Dogs', but it wasn't until his second film, the massively acclaimed black comedy 'Pulp Fiction' when he really took audiences nationwide by storm. After a string of widely popular films, with the exception of the grindhouse thriller 'Death Proof' which is in my opinion, his weakest film; this largely influential director takes a bold step into the western genre with this audacious western epic 'The Hateful Eight'. This film set in post-Civil War Wyoming, follows bounty hunter John Ruth (played by Kurt Russell), also known as 'The Hangman', who travels the snowy lands on a stagecoach manned by six horses, to an old town of Red Rock to turn in a notorious murderer Daisy Domergue (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh). He encounters former Civil War veteran Major Marquis Warren (played by Samuel L. Jackson), another bounty hunter who is carrying three dead bounties to turn in, and later Chris Mannix (played by Walton Goggins) who claims to be upcoming sheriff of Red Rock. When a wild blizzard hits, these people take shelter in an old cabin where they meet cowboy Joe Gage (played by Michael Madsen), English handyman Oswaldo Mobray (played by Tim Roth), old Mexican Bob (played by Damien Bichir), and former Civil War general Sandy Smithers (played by Bruce Dern). With everyone unfamiliar with each other, tension become increasingly heated when each of them revealed not to be who they say they are. This film dealt with some significant issues during development. One of which in particular began when the script was unexpectedly leaked online. This originally prompted the frustrated Tarantino to cancel the project and instead, publish it into a novel. Eventually, the director overcame the frustration and moved on with the project; and the result was a highly entertaining western film shot in classic 70 mm cinematography. This film is shot using rare 70 mm Ultra Panavison camera-work which has not been used since the 1960s, with Khartoum (1966) being the last known film using his camera. What becomes of this unique cinematography is a luxury widescreen picture to a powerful view of the cabin in which serves almost entirely as the film's setting. With the film set in one room for a large portion of the time, it reduces the sense of claustrophobia.Quentin Tarantino takes advantage of his typical filmmaking style in what maybe his boldest film yet. Filled with racially charged dialogue and colorful language, the film illustrates authentic racial tensions between the characters, and the concepts pays faith to the racial discrimination that ran rampant during the Civil War era and years after. Although set as a western epic, this film manages to squeeze a few elements of comedy in the mix, with the use of gallows humor that tends to shock, but at the same time, amuse the audiences. The dialogue is somewhat similar to the dialogue in 'Django Unchained' with its heavy and shameless use of the N-word, and is definitely enough to make some viewers uncomfortable and potentially turn them off. Those who have grown fans to Tarantino's previous works, however, will come with less shock. Now as the plot revolves around distinct characters and the tensions that arise between them, the film is very talky (even more so than 'Inglourious Basterds') and there are some lengthy conversations that drive the film for most of the first half. But thanks to the sharply written dialogue by Tarantino, the film moves a solid pace to where the three-hour runtime feels engaging and less of a boredom- fest. Then the second half, following a short intermission and overture, turns into a bloodbath. Scene after scene, this half features some gruesome violent scenes, some of which are a bit stomach- turning, with an intent of startling viewers, especially those who aren't used to Tarantino's style. The entire second half is where the plot takes a turn to a 'who done it'. During this time, viewers are dragged into shocking revelations by about the characters, which gradually heightens the suspense. Yes, this part does a feel like a homage of 'Reservoir Dogs', but at the same time, its surprisingly engaging.With such a star-studded cast, viewers can surely root for some powerful performances, and as you might expect, these performances are tremendous. Samuel L. Jackson who is a veteran to Quentin Tarantino's works, gives what is probably his boldest performance since his career-defining role in 'Pulp Fiction'. Kurt Russell who plays the ruthless bounty hunter, is quite powerful in his rather shocking role. Although he played the sadistic stunt driver in the grindhouse flick 'Death Proof', it is nowhere near as memorable as his prickly character here. Jennifer Jason Leigh who is new face to Tarantino's work is quite fascinating, and by the second half, shockingly nasty. But this does not deny that she is quite engaging in her role as the only female in the 'hateful eight'. Tim Roth and Michael Madsen, collaborators in Tarantino's debut film 'Reservoir Dogs' are strong here, as so is Bruce Dern, Damien Bichir, and Walter Goggins who are also new faces. Along with these tour-de- force performances, is a shocking appearance of an actor who many may never have would be seen in a Tarantino picture; and I would rather not give him away. It is hard to say which actor would receive an Oscar nod since most of them (if not all) are quite memorable and dedicated to their roles.The Hateful Eight is a genuine demonstration that Quentin Tarantino still has the incredible directorial caliber he is known for today. Thanks to a decent screenplay, character writing, stellar performances, and a powerful direction; this earns a spot as one of the best films of the year, at least in my opinion. It is astonishingly entertaining and a must-see, especially for those who are Tarantino fanatics.",9,3,15,6 January 2016
Moana," It is a whimsical, crowd-pleasing Disney-animated adventure for the whole family
","Ron Clements and Don Hall, the creators of Disney animated entries such as the video-game-plotted 'Wreck-It-Ralph', the musical- esque 'Frozen', and the recent hit 'Zootopia' have returned and have cooked up yet another thrillingly fresh adventure that is destined to appeal to both children and adults. Moana is a charm-filled picture that swarms just about everything it needs to be a superbly entertaining hit. It moves with moments of laughter, moments of charm, and even moments of sentiment. And much like recent endeavors such as 'Frozen', there is some singing. If there is even a slight shortcoming to this animated picture, it may be for being overly nostalgic to the classic Disney animated picture from the 1990s and early 2000s when the studios were at their hay days. However, this shortcoming may undoubtedly serve as a plus for those (particularly teens) reminiscent about the old days of Disney cartoons. Either way, this film falls nothing short of an astonishment to say the least. This film follows titular character Moana (voiced by Auli'l Cravalho), a young Polynesian girl who lives on island run by her overprotective father Chief Tui (played by Temuera Morrison). When the island crops begin dying and their food supply begins depleting, Moana, against her father's wishes, sets out across the sea in search of a demigod named Maui (voiced by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) who is in possession of a green stone capable of restoring the island's crops and bringing peace to her home. Together, the two journey across the sea in an adventure while fighting against the mysterious creatures that stand in their way.Disney Animation Studios has been no stranger delivering the goods when it comes to family-oriented entertainment, even when some of their entries slip into the category of forgettable. However, it is rare that many animated features come as glossy as this one in both the technical and narrative department. Glowing with powerfully dazzling animation including the photorealistic water, which happens to operate as a minor character throughout the story, this film represents the astounding progress of how far Hollywood has journeyed in computer animation. The animation is virtually flawless and hard not to look at. But the real icing on the cake is the story, which takes place mostly on a boat in the middle of the ocean, and execution. Following the eponymous character on an adventure to not only save her precious home but to discover her true self, this movie sparkles with surprises from beginning to end. There is kind- hearted humor to appeal to both kids and adults, and the voice performances are nothing short of spectacular. Auli'l Cravalho and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson who handle the voices of Moana and Maui respectively shine in their roles, particularly during the musical numbers which allow the actor and actress exercise their singing muscles. If you were one of those people who developed the vexing earworm from songs like 'Let It Go' or 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman', no need to worry! These songs manage to be fun and whimsical to listen to without feeling like to a chore to listen to over and over again. While the aforementioned musical singles from 'Frozen' were not necessarily bad songs, their reputations were greatly tarnished for those who were forced to listen to their friends or family members sing them or play them on the radio constantly. Then there is Alan Tudyk doing the voice of Heihei, a stowaway rooster who's dialogue is greatly confined to a series of squawks and chirps. Overall, there is absolutely nothing in the way of children having a fun time during the picture, except maybe the lava monsters which may just a little scary for the youngsters.Moana is a crowd-pleasing Disney-animated adventure that is bound to fill both kids and parents with delight and satisfaction. Among many of Disney's recent entries, whether or not this one manages to stand out is somewhat debatable. Nonetheless, this movie makes an irresistible, if familiar experience.",9,0,3,23 June 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Fun, charming comic-book adventure that proudly handles justice for the titular hero
","Our friendly neighborhood Spiderman has made his return to the big screen, and he is more charming than ever. With the filmmaking rights now handed to Marvel Studios from Columbia Pictures, the titular hero is gained membership to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a more unique approach unlike what he saw in the Sam Raimi trilogy or the underwhelming reboot series starring Andrew Garfield. With the days of Garfield as the web-slinging hero now three years in the rear-view mirror, this comic-book adventure helms Tom Holland in the role of the title character, after advertising a spectacular introduction in last year's 'Captain America: Civil War'. And the director responsible of this project is Jon Watts who grants the hero with a more zany approach than what we were accustomed to in the past, in attempt to connect him to the MCU's Avengers team. This also allows for brief appearances by MCU veterans such as Iron Man and even briefer ones by Chris Evans's Captain America. Following the events of Civil War, this film follows 15-year old Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland), a geeky high schooler struggling to balance his social life at school with his best friend Ned (played by Jacob Batalon), and his time crime-fighting as the titular web-slinging superhero which he hides of Aunt May (played by Marisa Tomei). Under the watchful, if overprotective eye of Tony Stark/Iron Man (played by Robert Downey Jr.), Peter must prove he is worthy of becoming the hero Tony wants him to be, as well as making a good impression of his crush Liz (played by Laura Harrier), when he faces down the evil Vulture (played by Michael Keaton) who is in possession of some dangerous weapons. Aside from shedding away from the slightly darker tone of the previous Spiderman entries, Jon Watts also grants the title character with a more polished story rather than rehashing familiar elements from the past. Instead of embarking on yet another origin story, this film jumps almost immediately into the action while setting up the relationship between Peter Parker and Tony Stark, with some sadly predictable results thanks to the trailer giving away certain plot points. This method allows for more potent character development. The story establishes Peter as a typical teenager with common high school problems including the struggles of impressing the girl of his dreams and getting caught in the crossfires of bully Flash Thompson (played by Tony Revolori) who often makes crude remarks of him. At the same time, it also touches on Peter's ambition to impress Tony and Happy Hogan (played by Jon Favreau, the supporting man of Stark Industries, when Michael Keaton's Vulture and his evil deeds catches his eye. This all leads to some exhilarating, frenetic action sequences polished some dazzling special effects. The rescue sequence on the United States monument is spectacularly executed, as is the scene of Spiderman trying hundreds of people on a ferry that gets fractured in half. The climatic scene on the airplane however, is a bit of an eyesore. Setting the scene at night with components of the plane exploding and sparks flying everywhere renders the fight between Spiderman and Vulture a bit too incoherent for the eyes to follow. Nonetheless, the final result somewhat pays off. As for Tom Holland, now the youngest actor portray the title character, he makes pleasant use of his role with a great sense of charm and humor that evokes a decent amount of laughs from time to time, even when some of the jokes fall flat. Michael Keaton also boasts a nice delivery as the main antagonist. Then there is Robert Downey Jr. who pops in and out as Tony Stark and Iron Man, only given around eight minutes of screen time.Spiderman: Homecoming is a fun, charming comic-book adventure that proudly handles the justice for the titular superhero, and rightfully does so without feeling the need to set up for the upcoming 'Avengers: Infinity War'. It is a fun superhero spectacle destined to please fans of both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the comics. If there is anything more accurate to bet on, it will be the astounding box office performance which will more than likely be in competition against last month's 'Wonder Woman'.",8,25,45,7 July 2017
The Expendables," Not much more than a typical everyday action flick
","Sylvester Stallone, star of the action series Rambo that made it's debut in 1982, takes on the lead of Barney Ross, a CIA operative who leads a band of mercenaries including martial arts prodigy Yin Yang (Jet Li), knife-throwing expert Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), machine gun specialist Hale Caeser (Terry Crews), demolitionist Toll Road (Randy Couture), and sniper Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lungren) on a mission to hunt down a ruthless CIA officer James Munroe (Eric Roberts) who is holds named South American women Sandra (Giselle Etie) hostage with the help of Mr. Church (Bruce Willis). Arnold Schwartsnegger also makes an appearance as an old friend of Barney Ross. Also directed by Sylvestor Stallone, this ensemble cast action film pays homages to classic 1980s action movies such Rambo, Die Hard, Commando, and Predator with its high octane action sequences and crisp special effects.This all-star action flick has quite the energy, but not as a fun of it should be. There is very plot development and nearly all the characters feel flat and one-dimensional. In fact, there really isn't a single character that stands out from others. Arnold Schwartznegger who's often taken lead roles of action films is blatantly underused, quite disappointing for many action fans. The cast performances aren't terrible, but nothing memorable and the cheesy dialogue certainly doesn't help. However, I found the performances a little more forgiving since these are veteran action stars we are talking about. On the bright side, the film manages to bring out the fun with it's high-kinetic action sequences, soaking the audience with intense 80s-style gun shootouts, blood and guts flying, and just enough explosions to make Michael Bay blush. The only thing that disappoints me about the action scenes is the use of CGI blood which I believe could use some improvement. The Expendables has its entertaining, but perhaps nothing original. This certainly isn't one of the best of Sylvestor Stallone's works, but I think this is be pleasing for some, but definitely not all action fans. If this film put more effort into its plot development and character construction, this would have been much more entertaining film.",6,0,0,17 October 2015
Pan's Labyrinth," Guillermo Del Toro crafts an exuberant, yet nightmarish fantasy world, blending high-classed visuals with and storytelling with sobering history on the European front
","Picture an adult version of 'Alice in Wonderland', add graphic violence and momentous themes to the mix, and you got yourself an accurate picture of Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth (or El Laberinto del Fauno in Spanish). This film takes a high-classed fantasy genre and spins into a dark, twisted universe where fairy tales clash with the grim history of the European front during World War II. The results that transpire is an Alice in Wonderland-like adventure that strikes at the heart not with whimsical excitement or charm, but with its wicked twists and turns that captures the innocence of childhood diminished under the unforgiving history that defined our world today. Do not let the visuals fool you, this is by no means a kid-friendly adventure. It is very dark, very violent, and proceeds a sense of dread from beginning to end; and Del Toro has almost no doses of levity to offer in the bargain. On the upside, the scarcity of child-friendly themes is what makes this high-classed fantasy tale so unique. The film is set in 1944 during the Spanish Civil War when Spain was being overrun by fascism. Following the death of her father who was killed in the war, 11-year old Ofelia (played by Ivana Baquero), a fairy tale obsessed youngster, moves with her mother (played by Ariadna Gil), who is growing ill from her pregnancy, to the country side of Spain to escape the chaos. There, she meets her new stepfather Captain Vidal (played by Sergi Lopez), a fascist army officer with a sadistic edge, and Vidal's housekeeper Mercedes (played by Meribel Verdu) who she grows a close bond with. On night, Ofelia is awoken by a fairy who leads her to a mysterious labyrinth where she meets a giant faun (voiced by Doug Jones). Upon meeting, she learns she is the princess of a magical kingdom, but must prove her loyalty by completing three unpleasant tasks before the full moon rises. As the war atrocities rage on and the lines between reality and fantasy begin to dissolve, Ofelia is pitted in a ruthless battle that threatens to tear both her and her family apart. Guillermo Del Toro wields a masterful hand at pulling us into his world where dreams turn to nightmares and fantasy morphs into horrifying reality. Rich in electrifying storytelling and powerful in balancing his signature visual methodology with hard-hitting substance, the film takes you on a ride that is vastly unpredictable with plenty of scares and thrills to fill the mix. The story operates on the base of the Spanish Civil War in which the action, beautifully shot by Del Toro, is intertwined back and forth with the lead character Ofelia's interaction with the fantasy world and the effects it leads on both her and her ailing mother. As Captain Vidal's tyranny ravages their home land, a gruesome battle between good and evil rages on to the point where all bets are off and the fate of each character could be the worst imaginable scenario. And the beauty of Del Toro's storytelling is that he never lets any moment go to waste nor does he make the critical mistake of allowing his nightmarish visuals tower over his narrative, especially when offering a solid history lesson on the atrocities of war in the European front. The fairies and the monsters, all of which are done by CGI, are astounding, yet scary to look at. We are talking about pale-skinned monster with no eyes on his side, but on the palm of his hands. The performances by Ivana Baquero and Meribel Verdu are amazing, but perhaps not enough to match up with Sergi Lopez's grim performance as Captain Vidal, the ruthless Hitler-like army officer who splatters the screen with his blood-stained demeanor. Each time he is on screen, the sense of discomfort fills the air. Pan's Labyrinth is an exuberantly crafted fantasy tale, constructed by the hands of Guillermo Del Toro who offers a near-flawless blend of twisted visual methodology and sobering history of the war in Spain. It is a high-classed fantasy that places a landmark on its genre in more ways than one. It is a definite must-see, but only for mature audiences. If you are a parent and make the ill-advised decision of letting your children sit through this, well, do not be surprised if you find them sneaking in bed with you in the middle of the night.",9,1,1,7 September 2017
Final Destination 2," Not too bad of a sequel
","Final Destination 2 is a sequel to the 2000 hit that left many people skeptical of going on a plane ride, set with a new set of characters. This time around involves Kimberly Corman (played by A.J Cook), who sets on a vacation with her friends to Daytona Beach. Like Devon Sawa's character in the first film, Kimberly has a terrifying premonition of her friends and everyone around dying in a horrific disaster, only this disaster a massive car pile-up that leads to a number of deaths. Kimberly intervenes and saves the lives of many (not all) people on the highway. However, she soon learns that Death still has the lives of the individuals she saved on it's agenda. She teams up with Thomas Burke (played by Michael Burke) and Clears Rivers (played by Ali Larter), who revives from the first film, in attempt to save them.This film carries roughly the same story structure as the first film, with an opening disaster and the people getting killed in strange accidents. However, I didn't this one to be as realistic as the first one. Some of the deaths in this film were okay, others were a bit too laughable. The deaths that occur during the massive car crash scene at the beginning were quite good and surprisingly realistic. Secondly, the characters are a bit underdeveloped. Unlike the other films, each of the characters do not have any unique personalities. In the others films, you had the jock, the geek, the hot girl, and all the other character stereotypes. This film didn't have these and made the characters incomprehensible.The good part of this film is the plot. The film moves a decent pace and has its moments of suspense. The climax towards the end was my favorite part of the movie. What I also liked how it connected with the first film, especially having Clear from the previous film return as the character who is incarcerated in a mental institution to protect herself from Death. Overall, this movie isn't a total letdown. It just not as good as the first.",5,0,1,19 July 2015
Alien," Ridley Scott's Alien is a scary, gritty, and influential piece of work to the science-fiction genre
","Since H.G. Wells's classic novel 'War of The Worlds', aliens have been one of the most iconic fictional creatures to stand the test of time in the science-fiction genre. This sci-fi/horror creature feature takes the trophy of not only marking a solid directorial inauguration for Ridley Scott, but also for redefining the alien subgenre. This spine-chilling alien invasion piece not only shows off Scott's versatile directing chops, but also serves as an influential classic to inspiring many sci-fi/horror tropes of the past few decades. Although some may admire the director's visceral blend of sheering suspense and startling visual effects as the movie's most valued accolade, it is difficult to argue the astonishing influence that this film has spread over the past many years; especially when you look at the large number of cheesy rip- offs Hollywood has flown at us. This film centers on a commercial crew of seven members travelling through space on a spaceship known as the Nostromo. The crew is lead by Captain Dallas (Played by Tom Skeritt) and consists of members Ellen Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver), Lambert (played by Veronica Cartwright), Brett (played by Harry Dean Stanton), Kane (played by John Hurt), Ash (played by Ian Holm), and Parker (played by Yaphet Kotto). When the crew receives a distress signal from an unknown source, they soon become terrorized by a mysterious extraterrestrial force that manages to sneak their way on the ship.If you picture John Carpenter's 'Halloween' and replace the masked killer with a grotesque-looking extraterrestrial and the suburban setting with the interior of a rundown spaceship, then you got this movie. This film is a terrifying ride. It focuses on the survival of seven individuals who are forced to use their intellect and weaponry to fend off against an otherwordly force that is beyond what they imagined. Ridley Scott effectively sets the action in an inspiring hodgepodge of firmly constructed atmosphere and a surplus of horrifying special effects. Similar to Steven Spielberg's method in 'Jaws', Scott makes a smart decision of not displaying the monster throughout the entirety the film, but generating a chilling wind of suspense that effectively builds up when the extraterrestrial creature finally shows itself on screen. When the creature reveals itself, it is brutally terrifying especially when the considered the surrealistic design of the sinister creature. And best of all, the creature serves perhaps not just as a cold-blooded killer but a moving force of the sinister atmosphere. Scott's methodology awards us with a powerful string of scares and thrills including the infamous chest-bursting scene. As for the acting department, the cast does mostly fine, but the shortage of character development does serve as a small hinder. The only one who manages to sustain a proper characterization is Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley who displays plenty of grit and heart in her tough female role.Alien marks not only a scary, heart-pounding science-fiction set piece, but an influential sci-fi/horror cinematic entry. It is an amazing work of art that boasts the incredible talent of visionary director Ridley Scott. Although it certainly shows its age, it is effective enough to leave moviegoers pining for more.",9,1,2,2 May 2017
The Polar Express," A delightful Christmas animated picture for the whole family
","There is absolutely no doubt that Christmas is one of the most (if not the most) pleasing times of the year: a time to gather around with family and friends and share the holiday spirit. Arguably one of the best family-friendly features to adore the pleasant spirit of Christmas is this computer animated feature directed by visual storytelling prodigy Robert Zemeckis. Based on the classic 1985 children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, the film expands upon the popular source material with Robert Zemeckis adding brighter characters and expanding the story trajectory on a wider scale. Further ingredients added to the mixing bowl is eye-dazzling computer animation supplied with motion capture technology to bring the story in life. And the final product is an appealing holiday showcase that not only feel magical, it's fun. Set in the 1950s, this film follows the story briefly narrated by Tom Hanks of an unnamed young boy (voiced by Daryl Sabara) who's grown up doubting the existence of Santa Claus. At midnight over Christmas eve, the boy is awoken by the roaring sound of the train that comes to a screeching halt in front of his house. Wandering outside, the boy boards the train where he meets a fellow group of children including an unnamed girl (voiced by Nona Gaye), a self-doubtful boy named Billy (voiced by Jimmy Bennett), and an obnoxious chatter box kid (voiced by Eddie Deezen). Together, these children take the trip to the North Pole where they face self-discovery and learn about the true meaning of spirit.Very few filmmakers in Hollywood accomplish stellar visual storytelling as good as Robert Zemeckis, and this animated picture showcases Zemeckis operating in this cinematic grandeur at arguably his finest form yet. With a hefty hand, Zemeckis proficiently excels in both the visual and the narrative department. The astounding world of the Polar Express along with the North Pole is gracefully brought to life through exhilarating computer animation and stunning motion capture technology used to breath into the human characters. While the cast of Tom Hanks (who also voices the train conductor), Daryl Sabara, Nona Gaye, Jimmy Bennett, and Eddie Deezen provide slick voice work for the characters; the other half of the equation is made up by another cast including Josh Hutcherson who take the roles of the characters in motion capture performances. Combine the motion capture and the top-notch computer animation and you got a beautiful world sprung to life with compelling imagery (especially when watching in 3-D). In terms of storytelling, the movie brightly shines like gold. Following the story of a young boy as he is drawn into a world of self discovery and spirit of Christmas he never knew. The message he along with his newly found friends acquire on their adventure is believing against doubt and how the meaning of Christmas carries something more than just the question of whether or not Santa is real. The concluding result is vastly charming as much as it's deeply heartwarming. The atmosphere is no tearjeaker nor a cartoony comedic fare, but it is deeply riveting especially when you witness the character breaking out in a touching musical number. Don't expect any Pixar material however! The Polar Express is a delightful Christmas animated feature that boasts heartwarming entertainment for both children and adults alike. This film makes not just for a pleasant surprise but a fine pick for families to gather around and watch during the holiday. Looking for a sweet animated feature for the holidays? The Polar Express may be one you are looking for.",9,1,2,24 December 2016
Black Mass," Gripping biopic complete with an outstanding performance by Johnny Depp
","In the height of Oscar Season, Johnny Depp brings what might be his most outstanding performance of his career in this biopic drama of the one of America's most notorious gangsters in history. Depp plays James 'Whitey' Bulger, an Irish mob boss in South Boston in the 70s and 80s, who stops at nothing to take down a group of Italian mafias that wreak havoc in this town. His violent duty leads him into jeopardy when he becomes a prime target of the FBI, with no one to trust but his childhood friend John Connolly (played by Joel Edgerton) who becomes a prime figure in the FBI. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Billy Bulger, his younger brother who works as the state senator. This film also features of the likeness of Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgood, Jesse Plemens, Rory Cochrane, Adam Scott, and David Harbour. This is directed by Scott Cooper who did Crazy Hear (2009 and Out of The Furnace (2013).To be honest, this film does not rise in the level of Martin Scorsese's works such as Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995), and The Departed (2006), it certainly has the feel of a classic mafia crime- drama film. The movie does its best on giving a gritty and violent portrayal of the gangster life as well as criminal underworld in Boston, similar to what Martin Scorsese showed in The Departed. James Bulger is shown be very violent and unflinchingly ruthless as he murders a large number of people, whether it is from shooting, torturing, or strangling. Nearly everything he does in this movie is unpredictable and shocking. There are many scenes with him that shocked me to the core, then other scenes that left me at the edge of my seat. Bulger is very powerful and mind-blowing character bringing a grim atmosphere to the story, and Johnny Depp is definitely brings him to life. Depp does a fantastic job at adding suspense and chills in this character, and he makes him so believable. I did, however, find the makeup done on his character to be somewhat distracting. While it does make almost unrecognizable, it certainly didn't take away from the outstanding performance he delivers. Joel Edgerton, who plays John Connolly also brings an terrific performance as Bulger's childhood friend who hides the secret of his dirty work. Another great aspect of the film is how it runs at a steady pace and always keeps the story alive, even when the pacing seems to slow down. Black Mass is certainly isn't a groundbreaking picture for the crime genre, but it is a movie that definitely deserves the attention of many. Johnny Depp's performance is fantastic and has a strong possibility of landing him an Oscar nomination. I believe this film will land several Oscar nomination including Best Picture.",8,5,13,20 September 2015
The Town," Ben Affleck's directorial efforts pay off
","Ben Affleck makes his second directorial effort after his debut in 'Gone Baby Gone' in this modern crime-drama set in the Charleston neighborhoods of Boston. Affleck plays Doug MacRay, a long-time bank robber who leads a group of criminals including his half-brother Jem Couglin (played by Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (played by Slaine), and Desmond Elden (played by Owen Burke), in a bank heist where Doug crosses paths with the bank manager Claire Keesey (played by Rebecca Hall) who witnesses the beating of her boss. Months later, their bank robbing spree comes to pause, and Doug comes face- to-face with Claire who doesn't recognize him from the robbery at a laundry shop. The two begin bonding eventually form a relationship, with Doug trying to keep his bank robbing spree a secret from Claire. The situation gets progressively dangerous when FBI agent Adam Frawley (played by Jon Hamm) and his crew set out in pursuit to take Doug and his crew down.Ben Affleck has been one of the most talented actors of this genre, and this film shows he is only gifted in acting, but also in directing and writing. Opening with the four main characters armed, and dressed in black suits and ghoul masks busting through the bank and wielding their guns at the employees; this movie gives a fascinating and realistic depiction of the lives of bank robbing criminals, and the consequences that ensue. The story evenly balances a romantic subplot between Ben Affleck's character and Rebecca Hall's character, and the main character and his group running a life of vicious crime. The storyline is written very sharply and rarely suffers from inconsistencies. The romance between Affleck and Hall is handled very maturely by not poisoning the characters with overly sappy dialogue and instead, giving the characters a believable touch while connecting to the main story. As this is a crime-based flick, there are some scenes that get a bit violent and at times, quite brutal; though not as harsh as what you would see a Martin Scorsese film. However, they effectively show the brash nature of the characters.Ben Affleck gives a really decent and grounded performance as the main character, though not as impressive as Jeremy Renner who delivers some outstanding acting as his half-brother. Although it wasn't quite expecting him to garner an Oscar nomination, I am being honest to say is quite impressive. Rebecca Hall also delivers a performance that deserves credibility. These actors are truly amazing and their characters feel so authentic thanks to their performance and Affleck's top notch screenplay. The Town is not likely go down as a classic and doesn't level up to the critically acclaimed crime flicks like 'Goodfellas' or 'The Departed'. Nonetheless, it is a very entertaining and solid addition to the crime genre. Ben Affleck does a great job in terms of acting, directing, and writing.",8,2,2,2 January 2016
Suicide Squad," Supervillains unite for plenty of action, but not enough wit
","With the Marvel Cinematic Universe skyrocketing in the popularity, the DC Universe has been subject to various attempts to get caught up on their path. DC was up to a fairly good start in the summer of 2013 when they rebooted the Superman franchise with 'Man of Steel', a spectacular cinematic representation of the one of the most iconic superheroes in store. Their progress however, fell short after the disappointing release of 'Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice', the film that failed to bring nuance and justice tot the portrayal of our heroes. DC Universe's second chance is then lied into the hands of this dark supervillain flick directed and written by David Ayer (Fury, End of Watch). Though this movie glorifies great creative autonomy in the portrayal of DC's notorious individuals, the heart of this cinematic piece finds itself plagued in the sea of mediocre writing and a lack of substance; though there is some fun to offered here. Following the events of Batman V. Superman, the film enters Viola Davis as intelligence operative Amanda Waller who recruits a gang of notorious villains on a mission to stop the evil Enchantress, who is possessed the body of archaeologist Dr. June Moone (played by Cara Delevingne, from taking over the world. Under the supervision Black Ops Colonel Rick Flag (played by Joel Kinnaman), the team includes gun-totting Deadshot (played by Will Smith), the sexy but deranged Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie) who is more interested in reuniting with the Joker (played by Jared Leto), the slick thief Captain Boomerang (played by Jai Courtney), the monstrous green creature Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the flame wielding El Diablo (played by Jay Hernandez, master assassin Slipknot (played by Adam Beach), and expert swordsman Katana (played by Karen Fukuhara).For a film as highly anticipated as this, this one may have the fun and humor to make up for an okay experience, but it definitely falls short of expectations, especially for the fanboys those who read the comics; and there a plenty of flaws that taint this highly anticipated vehicle. The first twenty minutes began with Viola Davis's character and her plan on assembling team. During this point, we are given spoon-fed introductions on each villain including their tragic backstory and their paths that lead them to the sadistic criminals they are. Out of all of them, only Harley Quinn and Deadshot's story truly stand out, and their character arcs speak more than volumes; the rest of the gang is left as two-dimensional figures with much more to speculate. The romance and partnership between Harley and The Joker is beautifully told, capturing the true image of the two iconic villains; and the same can said about Deadshot's story of his journey to the darkside and his eagerness to return to his daughter who witnessed the grim change in her father's character. Other than this, the character development remains less than seldom. And the worse part is that the most disappointing character (ironically) happens to be The Joker who is sadly reduced to just only eight minutes of time on screen, making him feel more of a guest character than a true villain of the story. It's quite dispiriting considering the maniacal vibe Jared Leto delivers as the iconic villain. Of course, this performance is far leveling up to what Heath Ledger brought in 'The Dark Knight' or even Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's adaptation. Arguably the most charismatic performance here would Margot Robbie who brings plenty of dark humor and pure insanity as the criminally insane Harley Quinn, and by her side is Will Smith who deliver right on the spot as Deadshot. The rest of the cast including Jai Courtney in what is easily his most charismatic role show off some credible performances, but nothing entirely memorable.As the plot revolves around the team's mission to defeat the Evil Enchantress, it descends into silly incoherent mess that favors a long stretch of visually compelling action sequences with plenty of special effects and explosive visuals to please the eyes, but not enough plot development. Through the antiheroes' battle against constant hordes of monstrous, zombie-like creatures lead by the Evil Enchantress, the story spends a great amount of time going almost nowhere. Don't get me wrong, these sequences are fun as the characters treat us to some clever (and occasionally crude) one-liners and some solid chemistry. After awhile, it's grows a little repetitive. And it certainly doesn't help that the scenes undergo some choppy editing with plenty of scenes cut out by the wishes of Warner Bros studios who wanted the story to go for a more 'humorous' tone than a less dark approach, despite the fact that the Dark Knight Trilogy (centering on a hero) captured a pretty dark and gritty feel. If you are gonna edit out some scenes, it would probably look better if it wasn't so obvious.Suicide Squad may have the fun and humor to make for a darkly funny ride, but it fails to capture the spirit of it's critically acclaimed source material or bring proper nuance to it's likable villains. In the end, it only further pushes the DC Cinematic Universe away from reaching the road to popular ranks of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",5,3,6,7 August 2016
Taxi Driver," A stunning masterpiece by Martin Scorsese
","Martin Scorsese has made a name for himself in Hollywood, and with his directorial efforts in the classic films like 'Raging Bull', 'Goodfellas', and 'Casino', it's not hard to see why. Scorsese is a man with a God-given talent in directing and writing, especially those pitted in the crime genre. This bleak crime-drama starring his most collaborator Robert De Niro is the film that really put in Scorses in the cinematic spotlight during the early years of his career. De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a mentally disturbed Vietnam War veteran living in the crowded streets of New York City. In the efforts to deal with his insomnia, Bickle takes a full-time job as a cab driver. Along the way, he meets a political campaign worker Betsy (played by Cybill Shepard) who he develops a relationship with. On the night of a botched date, their relationship fails to work out. Even worse, Bickle grows increasingly disillusioned by the crime and corruption in society, and he learns of a 12-year old girl named Iris (played by Jodie Foster) being a sex slave of a local pot-smoking low-life named Sport (played by Harvey Keital), Bickle decides he must take matters into his own hands and make a stop to his madness. Martin Scorsese puts directorial compelling efforts in the film, as does Robert De Niro as the main character who immediately grabs your attention when he is first introduced. The film takes viewers on a journey through the mind of a mentally disturbed war veteran has taken serious offense to the cruelty and corruption going on in our society, and the story progresses through how it affects him as a person to where he transforms from an average New York City guy to a anger-fueled gun-wielding vigilante who does not take crap from anyone. This leads into some dark and shocking scenes that always keep the film the moving, particularly during its aggressive climax. Robert De Niro serves as the pinnacle of this film with his arresting performance, and the intense conviction he brings his character is more than enough to make his character believable and someone you do not want to be on the bad side of. By today, this is easily stands as one of his landmark roles of his career. Jodie Foster who was only 13 at the time is quite good what was her debut role in her career. Then Harvey Keital who plays Sport, the low-life pimp who forces Jodie Foster's character into prostitution is very strong with his performance, putting well effort into such a creepy and utterly deranged character who will have viewers rooting for justice brought upon his madness. The characters are incredibly well written and developed with pride. Another interesting gem comes from the cinematography. The imagery of nighttime New York City soaking with neon lights is outstanding and beautiful to look at, especially for a 70s picture. Taxi Driver is a profound masterpiece by Martin Scorsese, and one of the most cinematic achievements to this day. Robert De Niro is thoroughly irresistible in his role, and shows why he is the brilliant actor many know and love today. Martin Scorsese may have some new films in store in the future, none of them will ever measure up to this. Scorsese is a filmmaker who many can find deeply admirable and his works show a powerful demonstration.",10,0,2,3 April 2016
Shutter Island," Twisted, somber, but hugely entertaining Scorcese thriller
","Martin Scorcese has laid many cinematic landmarks in crime genre, and as a result, has earned a spot as one of the most influential directors to ever step foot in Hollywood. He has been met with much critical acclaim with his gritty portrayal of the gangster life in his film such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, and The Departed. Teaming up with his frequent collaborator Leonardo Dicaprio, Scorcese takes a more dark and surreal direction in this psychological thriller set with plenty of twists and turns. Leonardo Dicaprio plays U.S Marshal Teddy Daniels, who travels across seas to investigate a mysterious and deserted island along with his partner Chucke Aule (played by Mark Ruffalo). There lies a hospital run by Dr. Cawley (played by Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Neahring (played by Max Von Sydow) holding mentally insane prisoners, where Daniels and Aule are in search of a patient named Rachel who has mysteriously disappeared. Going further into their investigation, the two quickly turn the dark and sinister secrets behind the wretched prison of a hospital, soon to the point where Daniels deteriorating of his mental state and his identity all together. Mixing elements of neo noir and elements of pure horror, this film conveys a dark and surreal plot that unfolds to something truly shocking and well crafted in a unique way. The psychological elements conveyed throughout the story go very deep in ways that may remind those who seen films like 'Seven' or 'The Sixth Sense' as these both deal with individuals who are psychological damaged. This film paces steadily through one spine- chilling thrill after another, and as the story progresses, the tone gets more and more eerie; building up an astonishing plot twist at the end that is likely to leave you startled. Like David Fincher's 'Seven', this film never lightens up in tone, giving you the feeling of hopelessness throughout its run time, yet it's still entertaining. The plot doesn't go without its flaws however. The film has its moments where gets overly convoluted to the point I could leave you scratching your head. Ultimately, the plot picks up not to soon before it reaches its grim climax.Leonardo Dicaprio has been one of my favorite actors for as long I can remember, an actors always shows off powerful performances, yet has never landed an Oscar for his works. His performance as the main character Teddy Daniels is terrific. He is very charismatic throughout, especially when his character go through some spine-chilling changes. Mark Ruffalo who plays his partner also deserves some applause for his performance, playing his role very solid and willfully. Ruffalo is who I believe is an underrated actor and hope garners an Oscar one day (as well as Dicaprio). Shutter Island is a twisted, but stunning piece of entertainment by Martin Scorcese, complete with a terrific screenplay, powerful performances, and a strong narrative that grabs your attention. This is much different than the typical Scorcese fare. Nonetheless, it is astonishingly entertaining.",9,3,5,31 December 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Superb continuation of Captain America
","Captain America strikes back in this sequel to the 2011 box office hit that bridges a continuation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a sequel that not only boasts some of the best action sequences and heavy special effects of recent memory but also improve upon its predecessor. Expanding the character development and a more charged plot, Winter Soldier takes just about everything from the original and cranks them up to the next level. Chris Evans reprises his role as Steve Rogers who now works side-by-side for S.H.I.E.L.D with Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow (played by Scarlett Johansson) but has difficulty adjusting to the modern world as Captain America when dealing with powerful threats and moral obligations. Worse, he discovers SHIELD is being threatened by a terrorist group known as Hydra and the threat becomes real when SHIELD director Nick Fury (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is attacked and mortally wounded when Steve a visit at his apartment. With fingers pointed at him and his trust put to the test Steve, Natasha, and his trusted friend Sam Wilson a.k.a Falcon (played by Anthony Mackie) must fight against tyrant group while facing against questionable figures he once trusted. It's difficult not see how well and what this film improves upon the first film. While the first one is highly entertaining and brought upon some likable characters and a plot keep it moving, this one digs deeper into the character arc and plot development while leaving room for fantastic special effects and pulse-pounding action. Chris Evan returns in the titular role and is more likable than ever before. Granted by a more three-dimensional development and a slight taste of humor, Evans strives in this role and displays his most charismatic performance ever put to screen. Scarlett Johansson is no exception. She stands well as Steve Roger/Captain America's trusted sidekick Black Widow and much of the appeal she brought to 'The Avengers' but with much more substance. Anthony is also quite entertains in his supporting role, and someone who viewers come to like. These actors appear to have fun as their characters and the chemistry results in a trio that audience can't help but care. If there is any surprise, it may come from Robert Redford playing a SHIELD agent, a role much different than what many audience are used to seeing him in. The first film boasted a great introduction of our titular hero in a plot that generated plenty of fun and endearment, but the plot comes much more engrossed. As the plot centers around the main character facing off against an evil terrorist called Hydra which some may find familiar from the comics as the forces that brutally hunt down our heroes, it presents a more violent and darker tone but nonetheless a deeper atmosphere. Throughout the story, the characters are taken into deeper roots and surprises and with such an inspiring screenplay, it all works. Not to say it goes in the realm of flawlessness but is moves far enough to where it's flaws will come easily unnoticed. Along with the powerful plot development comes some of exciting, adrenaline-field action sequences complete with amazing stunt work and special effects too difficult not to appreciate. One scene in particular takes place with Captain America in an elevator that comes with quite a surprise, and in the end easily one of the most memorable scenes in the film. The action sequences do dominate much of the second half but what makes exciting other than the inspiring special effects is they never feel repetitive. As a result, they remain eye-catchers to the audience.Captain America: Winter Soldier is a great example of a sequel that manages to dig deeper upon its original outing, and thanks by the strong direction by Anthony and Joe Russo it's fun to watch and serves as a solid addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is very entertaining and will have viewers, particularly Marvel fans pumped for the next film Captain America: Civil War which I am genuinely excited about.",9,1,3,3 May 2016
Doctor Strange," Gleaming with astounding visuals and storytelling, Doctor Strange makes for a swell Marvel outing
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been boosting its numbers at the box office and fandom for almost a decade, and simply because it has made a landmark home for adventurous superhero action-packed spectacles for die-hard comic book fans; even when the cinematic world introduces them to a lesser-known superhero like Ant Man. This cinematic translation of the mystical superhero Doctor Strange is nothing special in terms of storytelling as a follows a usual origin story of it's titular hero, but it manages to paint a fun, action-filled spectacle with a surprising appealing story along with some of the most eye-popping visual effects of this year (bound for Oscar awards). The film tells the story of Dr. Stephen Strange (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), an arrogant neurosurgeon who is involved in a horrible car accident that causes severe nerve damage in his hands, rendering them completely useless. With his job in the medical field, he travels to a mysterious world overseas known as Kamar-Taj in hopes of finding a treatment to restore his usage in his hands. He instead encounters a bald sorcerer known as the Ancient One (played by Tilda Swinton) and her wizardly accomplices Mordo (played by Chiwetel Eijiofor) and Wong (played by Benedict Wong). With the help of their teachings, he must master the mystical powers and skills to help conquer the threat between the real world and the darkness that lies beyond.As I mentioned above, this is an origin story of the titular hero which has become a common trope throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or for the most of the superhero for that matter. But with the origins of the hero playing the central in the film, director Scott Derrickson manages to cook up a fresh one so compelling, it almost feels original. Doctor Stephen Strange is introduced as a rather unlikable doctor who viewers himself as the sharpest tool in the shed, and is shown to be very arrogant towards his colleagues as well as his former lover Christine (played by Rachel McAdams). Over time, his character develops into a selfless, charismatic hero is willing to set aside his cocky persona to master his mystical skills and destroy the evil force that threatens the world as we know it. This all comes down to a plethora of adrenaline-fueled action sequences where we witness intoxicating, abstract visual imagery and environments folded and manipulated into complex, mandala-like figures in a fashion that owes physics to Christopher Nolan's 'Inception'. The visuals may triumph over the storytelling, but it's not to say the plot doesn't deliver nor does Benedict Cumberbatch in the role as the titular hero; though his attempts at comic relief come off a bit dull more than not. The same can said for his co-stars Tilda Swinton, Benedict Wong, and Chiwetel Eijiofor who do nothing short of a worthy job.Doctor Strange is a gleaming superhero spectacle that gracefully introduces a new hero to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and pumps sheer anticipation for fans everywhere see him make an appearance in upcoming Marvel outings including a hopeful spot in the Avengers franchise. This film is no groundbreaker in the superhero genre nor in the MCU, but it sure his one that proves worthy.",9,1,3,8 November 2016
Interstellar," Visually stunning sci-fi thrill ride
","Christopher Nolan has made big impressions on us with his visual effects, in summer blockbusters like The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception. However, Nolan takes his visual style and narrative talent up to the next level in this complex science-fiction thriller. Matthew McConaughey (Oscar winner from last year's Dallas Buyers Club) stars as Joseph Cooper, a Texas-native father of two children: daughter Murphy and teenager son Tom, living in the not-too-distant future where the world is running scarce on food supply, crops have declined dangerously low and humanity's day are numbered. He is soon called by NASA to take on a mission to travel through the Galaxy in search of a wormhole that could lead to a new home for humanity. Joining Dr. Amelia Brand (played by Anna Hathaway), he struggles against the complexities and perils of the intergalatic environments as well as the decision between saving humanity and the possibility of seeing his family again. This is one of the most visually striking films I've seen in a long time. Christopher Nolan pushes the boundaries of both visual effects and imagination, and brings some eye-popping visuals taking place in outer space you would never forget. The film succeeds not only with ravaging a stunning visual beauty, but also with plenty of scientific food for thought that leaves viewers curious about the nature of astrophysics. The way the film depicts the wormholes and the black holes comes be a cerebral eye-catcher. Now I am not a science guy so I don't how scientific accurate the film is, but it gives a realistic depiction of reality in space. And the plot, though slow at times, manages to associate well with its powerful and scientifically complex story while abandoning its emotional resonance. Some may argue that the plot doesn't quite sustain its 169-minute runtime. Those numbed by the scientific complexity or slow moving storyline may not stay through beginning to end, but there is plenty of strong elements dotted throughout the duration to captivate viewers Let's not forget the incredible performance by Matthew McConaughey. He did a great job on making his character and the bond with his children in the emotional scenes so believable, just by his emotionally driven acting. Anna Hathaway also delivers a performance that stands strong and honorable.Interstellar is a visually stunning, emotionally powerful sci-fi flick full of surprises and thought-provoking elements that could possibly lead this film to stand as a classic within the next decade. This film is an amazing and striking achievement by Christopher Nolan.",10,5,10,1 April 2015
Full Metal Jacket," Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam War epic is both gritty and spectacular
","From the early 60s to the late 90s before his death, Stanley Kubrick introduced audiences everywhere with some of the biggest masterpieces in the history of cinema. Touching on various subjects ranging including war, politics, crime, science-fiction, horror, and many others; this highly spoken director is found by many to be one of the greatest filmmakers to ever step in foot in Hollywood, there is no doubt why. One of his biggest films I will forget was this Vietnam War epic based on the novel by Gustav Hasford. This gritty adaption tells a dual segmented story of a U.S Marine platoon during their grueling days of boot camp training. The platoon is ran under command by the ill-tempered, loud-mouthed Drill Sergeant Hartman (played by R. Lee Ermey) who pushes the fellow marines to the very limits, and does not hesitate butcher with loud profanity during training sessions. Matthew Iodine plays Private J.T Davis, nicknamed 'The Joker', who stands as a bright example to his fellow marines. Then there is Vincent D'Onofrio who plays Private Leonard Lawrence, under the name 'Gomer Pyle', an overweight marine who never seems to stay in line with everyone else, and results in constant scolding from Sergeant Hartman. The story then cuts to months later, with Private Davis on the battlefield during the 1968 Tet Offensive operation in Vietnam. There, him and his group of marine recruits face the harrowing realities of war.Stanley Kubrick gives a powerful and realistic taste on the Vietnam War in this film, and his direction works magnificently. From the opening scene, the film presents sharp look at the characters during their boot camp training, and the dilemmas that go on during training. These scenes are handled very strongly and do nothing to sugarcoat, nor exaggerate the realities marines face while training before entering the war zone. R. Lee Ermey is the biggest prize during these scenes, sporting a powerful performance with his loud temper and mean- spirited reviling. Ermey doesn't just play the role, but just swallows it up with diligence, and his effort pays off well. Matthew Iodine plays the role of Private Davis very naturally, and shows great chemistry with just about every character on screen, especially when the story moves into the combat territory during the second half. When we get into the Vietnam portion of the film, the tone shifts into the darker atmosphere, with graphic and authentic scenes of combat set during the Tet Offensive , and how the rawness of war affects the characters. These scenes are shot so well thanks to solid cinematography by Douglas Milsome, and treat us with a gritty depiction of what the Vietnam War was like.Full Metal Jacket stands as one of Stanley Kubrick's best pictures, and is great addition to the war genre. This is film is spectacular and something highly recommend to everyone. It may not stand at the top list of other Vietnam War flicks like 'Apocalypse Now' or 'Platoon', but it definitely deserves your attention.",8,0,1,11 January 2016
Pacific Rim," Guillermo Del Toro's combination of cutting-edge special effects, dazzling plot, and spectacular scenery make for an explosive good time
","The best way to describe this science-fiction action piece would be a cross between 'Transformers' and 'Godzilla'. And when adding the ingredients of eye-feasting special effects, a solid plot, and Guillermo Del Toro's cutting-edge visual compulsion, your final product is an explosively entertaining thrill ride that works in more ways than one. Guillermo Del Toro, the man who gifted us with cinematic hits such as 'Pan's Labyrinth', 'Hellboy' and its sequel, knows how to keep things and does so in many ways many directors of both of the action and sci-fi genre neglect nowadays. And that is establishing a firmly even balance of explosive action set pieces and visual integrity while not letting lose on the film's narrative standpoint. His vision of giant robots battling toe-to-toe against a hideous Godzilla-like monsters work in a way that allows moviegoers to admire his dazzling directorial style while shoving popcorn in their mouths as the explosive scenery that fires on screen. There is a lot to be experienced from witnessing the major cities crumbled on a grand scale in the heat of a battle between two giant monsters fighting head-to-head, more so than just watching things go BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! This film centers around a world between the human race and an enormous alien creature known as the Kaiju who has launched an invasion that has devastated millions of lives across the lives. With mankind on the brink of extinction, its last line of defense comes at the hands of former pilot Raleigh Becket (played by Charlie Hunnam) and an inexperience pilot Maki Mori (played by Rinko Kikuchi) who arm themselves inside a giant mechanical mecha known as the Jaeger in attempt to defeat the Kaiju, with Marshal Stacker Pentecost (played by Idris Alba) in command. Unlike filmmakers like Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich, Guillermo Del Toro doesn't believe in soaking the audiences with explosive shock and awe factor with cutting-edge special effects, he also injects a heart the midst of the action. This includes blessing the characters with an arc and supporting the action with a story that firmly makes sense. In return, the film holds a gift with more than an escapist action extravaganza. Over his past works, Del Toro boasted an solid visual methodology that can only be described as unforgettable, and his style makes his return back here, only without the macabre sort of look demonstrated in 'Pan's Labyrinth'. The main military base where all the non-action takes place is beautiful look at, sporting a dazzling futuristic look. But, unsurprisingly, it is the sequences in which the two main characters Raleigh and Mako step into the Jaegers and battle against the Kaiju that marks the film's peaks. The big action sequence surrounding the destruction of downtown Hong Kong is electrifying and makes for a nice treat for the action junkies to snack on. Building exploding and disintegrating into a million pieces, what is there not to be fond about? And it is thanks to cinematographer Guillermo Navarro who captures the action with stellar integrity and not with the vexing quick cuts and shaky cam to obscure the heat of the action. Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi on the other hand, turn in some okay performances. But they are definitely no match for Idris Alba who stands with not only at the best performance in the crowd but the most solid character arc. Hunman and Kikuchi, however, are at least more tolerable than Charlie Day as the spastic scientist showers who's jittery behavior grows less an less funny as the film goes on, and Ron Perlman who serves as the supporting comic relief but is given very little to do. It comes show though, that not everyone is in for the gold. Pacific Rim is a thrillingly entertaining sci-fi action vehicle helmed by the intriguing directorial efforts of Guillermo Del Toro and his gift for visual spectacle and patent for feeding the audiences for an engaging collage of special-effects action with a heart and soul. This film does not aim for anything groundbreaking, but that doesn't matter because as a whole, the film is a lot of fun.",9,0,0,17 August 2017
American Sniper," American Sniper is a powerfully riveting biopic assembled by the absorbing efforts by Clint Eastwood
","American Sniper is one of the most powerful war movies Hollywood has unleashed in recent years, as well as one of the most controversial. Concerning the one of America's most celebrated Navy Seals Chris Kyle, this movie offers an enthralling, if not masterful inside look on an American soldier who's been showered with endless respect for his duty in the Iraq War (like many soldiers who set out to fight overseas), while remaining a questionable figure by some of the public. Chris Kyle has varied in what many called a true American hero for his active duty, while condemned as a cold-blooded killer by others for his callous attitude towards Iraqis, at least what was described in his autobiography. Nonetheless, Hollywood mogul Clint Eastwood brings his appealing cinematic talent to the screen to this admired American figure to life in a riveting form. By no means in this biopic a masterpiece, but it firmly demonstrates true talent both in front and behind the camera. This film focuses on the true story of Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper), a U.S Navy Seal who garnered fame upon racking up over 150 confirmed skills during his duty in Iraq. The story follows Kyle during his four tours in Iraq and the struggles he faces back his Post- Traumatic Stress symptoms and the strain in his relationship with his family, particularly his wife Taya (played by Sienna Miller).This movie is not the first time Clint Eastwood has tackled on the casualties of war. After all, he was the director behind 'Flags of Our Father' and 'Letters to Iwo Jima', both of focused on World War II in the Pacific Theater. This film however, sees Eastwood focusing on not an entire platoon trudging through the heat of a bloody battle, but a single figure who was forced to deal with the punishing horrors of war both on the battlefields and the psychological and emotional state of his character. The combat sequences set in the urban areas of Iraq are exuberantly shot and executed in a way that showcasing the sobering nature of active combat. Soldiers are brutally killed, and some of which we get to know very well. While the political complexities of the war are only thinly explored, Eastwood doesn't fail to show that war is hell. The scenes taking place off the battlefield is where most of the emotional resonance hits hard. As his active duty takes a toll on his wife who's disheartened by his physical and emotional absence, the story opens up a wider and brighter light on the complicated nature of Chris Kyle. In particularly, Kyle is brightened with a powerful performance by Bradley Cooper who fuels great fortitude and versatility in the role. While Eastwood makes the effort to portray the centric character as a hero, the controversy surrounding the man may give those who are less of a fan of him a cold shoulder, mainly due to some claims about his callousness towards the Iraqi mentioned in his autobiography. In the end, it is somewhat easy to see both sides of the argument of why he is respected by some and hated by others. American Sniper is a powerful, riveting biopic that excels with the immersive talent of both Bradley Cooper and director Clint Eastwood. Like many war movies, this one hit hard, enough to have driven my friends and I to tears as we walked out of the theater. Although the patriotic tone of the story and the portrayal of the Iraqi may prove to be a bit too jingoistic for some, there is certainly some talent on and off the camera that deserves to be admired.",8,46,95,19 January 2015
Glory," This Civil War period piece is simply stunning
","Set in the mid-1800s when the South was ravaged by slavery of the African-American descent and society was plagued by the spread of racial prejudice against all outside the White protestant, this Edward Zwick directed period piece pulls viewers into the harsh reality of the Civil War, a violent, bloody conflict between the Union and Confederacy that changed the face of America forever; but without the deaths of many American lives. Based on true historical events, this Civil War epic sees a charismatic cast of Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman, and Denzel Washington each in one of their most alluring roles of their career, with performances that shine like gold and a beautifully written story that drives on an irresistibly powerful journey through the heart of one of America's harshest periods. The film tells the intriguing story of Colonel Robert Shaw (played by Matthew Broderick) following his injury in the devastating Battle of Antieham, a soldier of the Union Army who lead the first African American infantry unit on the battlefield with his childhood friend Lieutenant Cabot Forbes (played by Cary Elwes)second in command. Some of his unit recruits include former slave Private Silas Trip (played by Denzel Washington) and Sergeant Major John Rawlins (played by Morgan Freeman) as these brave men sprawl across the South in a blood-raging battle against the Confederate Army.What becomes of a war for freedom costs the lives of the brave ones who are willing to fight for it, and this historical epic doesn't pull the punches when showing this. Opening up with the brutal depiction of the Battle of Antieham that ends in gruesome imagery of mortally wounded soldiers, this film sees Edward Zwick portraying the reality of the Civil War in arguably one of its finest cinematic depictions yet, if not the best. The story which is written by Kevin Jarre magnificently sets off a compelling journey of Colonel Robert Shaw and his daunting effort to lead a group of African-Americans in a fight for justice, while facing various tribulations of war and the hardships of keeping the old soldiers in lane. While the characters (even Robert Shaw) are by no means unlikable, they are definitely shown to be conflicted with inner demons; particularly from the results of their experience of racial prejudice, And this provides plenty of elements of substance. As the story progresses, we are allowed precious time to explore the heroism of the characters as well as their uncertain flaws including the rebellious Silas Trip played by Denzel Washington who is deeply absorbing and emotionally investing in his role, a man who struggles to face the hardships of role and rebels against his fellow commander; resulting in a emotionally powerful whipping scene. Matthew Broderick and his co-stars Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman are also given the opportunity the stretch their immersive talent in their roles. But in the end, it is Washington who becomes the primary source of poignancy.Glory is a stunning Civil War epic that succeeds on a smart narrative scope, but not without the enchanting performance by Matthew Broderick and the leading source of emotional resonance by Denzel Washington. Though this isn't the grittiest war picture out there, especially when compared to more modern efforts in the war genre. But it is definitely a smart one that is more than worth sitting through.",9,1,1,25 October 2016
Lion," Emotionally captivating as it is powerfully acted, Lion is an admirable true-story-based tale
","Some stories are difficult to believe until you witness them through the lens of a Hollywood director who takes from the pages of the autobiography. Focusing on a story of a young boy who face one of the most terrifying situations both a parent and a child would ever faced, this film tackles the hope and determination of a young man who will do anything in this power to return to the life he unwillingly left behind. The central figure of the story here is an Indian man named Saroo Brierly who was separated from his home at a young age and made major headlines upon his loss as well as his eventual return -- which didn't come until decades later. Garth Davis is the man responsible of bringing this strange, but true event to life in this emotionally powerful cinematic stride, and the concluding product is a both a beautiful and sobering biographical tale that makes a fair contender for tugging at your heart strings. Opening up in 1986, this movie follows five-year-old Saroo (played by Sunny Pawar), a young Indian boy living with his older brother Guddu (played by Abhishek Bharate) who he helps out with gathering coal to help their mother take care of the family. One night, when Saroo falls asleep on a train while looking for his brother, he wakes up to find the train moving and soon transported 1,500 miles away from his hometown. Stranded by himself with nowhere to go and no knowledge on how to speak anything outside his Hindi language, Saroo is adopted by an Austrailian couple Sue and John Brierly (played by Nicole Kidman and David Wenham). 25 years pass, Saroo (played by Dev Patel), now an adult, falls in love with college student Lucy (played by Rooney Mara). Along the way, he is introduced to Google Earth which he discovers he must use in order to track down his home and find his way to reunite with his family.Garth Davis presents this inspiring tale with both melancholy and unexpected charm. Those who are even remotely familiar with the story are likely to predict both the midpoint and the final outcome. Nevertheless, Davis knows how to keep things intriguing for at least most of the run. This does not conclude that the story doesn't hit just a few weak points. The first hour brilliantly showcases the fear and utter puzzlement of young Saroo as he journeys through some unsettling obstacles including a group of homeless children who are abducted with no warning, and landing into an orphanage where children are treated with callousness. This contributes to an effective exploration of the underprivileged environment that Indians are forced to endure. Food is not easy to come by and the economy rests in a third-world state of condition. The entire trajectory of his half is beautifully shot by Greig Fraser and powerfully acted by Sunny Pawar who delivers a striking portrayal as the young lad. It is mesmerizing to watch as it is harrowing to sit through. And the the music score by Dustin O'Halloran and Hauschka is a thing of beauty. The second half exhibiting the story of Saroo as an adult where the film loses a little steam. Although the segment nicely operates with an endearing performance by both Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman as well as offering deep exploration into the relationship between Saroo and his newly adopted family, it doesn't escapes from its emotionally empty state, at least not until the final ten minutes when Saroo finally reaches his moment of triumph. In the midst of the harrowing atmosphere, the film leaves just a little room for some levity. And Garth Davis never slides into the zone of emotional or narrative contrivances. Lion is both an uplifting and melancholy picture that strikes at the heart with some powerful deliveries in both the narrative and performance departments, and transcends the story into something of beauty. This film will not fail to leave some moviegoers reaching for the tissues, especially at the end. If you are one of the those people, no need to feel embarrassed. This is a true-story-based picture that deserves plenty of attention.",8,0,0,24 June 2017
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump is not just heartwarming, it is a triumphant cinematic work of art with Tom Hanks exercising the role of his career
","Calling Forrest Gump may be saying a lot, but there is nearly impossible to deny the astounding talent roaring in front and behind the camera. Robert Zemeckis, a filmmaker with a heavenly gift of storytelling, take his talent to the fullest extent with this heartwarming, charm-fueled tale focuses on the eponymous fighting to find his place in the complex world many people struggle to understand. This movie, unraveled from the pages of the screenplay by Eric Roth, lightens the flame with cinematic mastery with storytelling that blends landmark American history with a timeless tale of a misunderstood man with the heart of gold. When you are supposed laugh, you will laugh. When you are supposed to cry, your eyes will get soaked; and that is only half of the beauty that makes this adaptation of Winston Groom's novel of the same name a triumphant piece of cinematic glitter. So this film stars Oscar- winner Tom Hanks as, yours truly, Forrest Gump, a forty-something year old Alabama man who suffers a low IQ but nonetheless carries a gentle soul. Providing the framework of the story is Forrest sitting on the park bench as he tells his story to various individuals of his life from his childhood, to his adult life where he caught in the middle of America's landmark moments including the meeting with President John F. Kennedy, to his tour in Vietnam where he forms friendship with his squadmate Lieutenant Dan (played by Gary Sinise), to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. While caught up a series of political unrest that ran rampant during the 60s and 70s, he finds himself distracted in his pursue for his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright) who's life is in shambles, while reflecting his life choices all of the wisdom of his mother (played by Sally Field). This movie never takes its chances to pull at our heart strings for granted, but never does so in a way that feels hammy or exploitative. It is a film with that almost always has its heart in the right place while gently feeding you the message of in the world full of darkness and despair, there is always an underlining humanity resting somewhere within. Forrest in particular, wins our hearts with his heartwarming personality as he ventures through key moments in America's history while refusing the let go of the woman dear to his heart. Each scene following Forrest in the midst of the political tension including the Vietnam War, the ill-fated JFK administration is handled with maturity with an underlining dose of snappy charm. Flowing with an uproar of social commentary without slapping the story with a bias agenda, it is satisfying to see Robert Zemeckis prevail his effort in balancing a compelling story with a sweet batch of swift history lessons. Of course, the romantic drama is the brighter star in the story. The separation between him and Jenny transpires to moments of both bittersweet and melancholy, and the emotional chemistry really grabs at the heart, especially in the beginning when we get a sad inside look at her childhood at the hands of her abusive father. And thanks to Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, the romantic affinity between them works gracefully. Robin Wright plays her role with plenty of humility to prove her talent as an actress. However, this comes less of a surprise than Tom Hanks who tackles on what may be the most triumphant role of his career. Hanks plays the title character, a man with a mental disability that requires a kind of performance that could have easily come off as mawkish and ham-fisted. Luckily for a talented actor he is, his performance is blisteringly top-notch with moments that effectively show the down-to-earth nature of his character. He is the ultimate reason why his chemistry with not only Robin Wright, but his friend Gary Sinise as the well-acted Lieutenant Dan works well. Forrest Gump is a triumphant slice of cinematic art blooming with a a career-defining performance by Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis working at his prime with a cinematic piece that is simply timeless, if not a masterpiece. For a movie that was predicted to be a critical and commercial by many prior to its release, it is definitely one hell of a sleep hit. I guess it comes to show that Forrest's mother was right when she said 'life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.'",9,1,1,5 December 2017
Gone Baby Gone," Gone Baby Gone is full of twists and turns that take you on a powerful, uncompromising journey of pain and deceit
","Ben Affleck has shed beautiful light on his talent as an actor on screen. But about his talent behind the camera? Making his directorial debut, Affleck crafts a dark and twisted tale about every parent's worst nightmare: the kidnapping of a child. Packed with unexpected twists and powerful emotional resonance to keep the heart pounding to its very last breath, Gone Baby Gone is an uncomfortably profound experience that dares to leave you convinced of the unsettling events that unfold on screen, the opening minutes of exposition, to the shocking twist of moral dilemmas and the blurred lines between right and wrong. By no means is this a comfortable picture to sit through. It is dark, grisly story where the moments are levity are as scarce as water in the desert. After all, the events are inspired by the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane who also wrote 'Mystic River'. Set in Boston, the director's hometown, this film follows Patrick Kenzie (played by Casey Affleck, Ben's younger brother) and Angie Gennaro (played by Michelle Monaghan), two private detectives who are hired by Lionel (played by Titus Welliver) and Bea McCready (played by Amy Madigan) to go under investigation for their missing four-year-old niece Amanda, initially against the will of her drug-addicted mother (played by Amy Ryan). As the two dive deeper and deeper into the investigation, they are confronted with suspicious secrets involving local drug dealers, gang members, and the local law enforcement that leaves them questioning everything they about this case. Thanks to Ben Affleck, this is a mystery/thriller that avoids following the tracks of a straightforward narrative, but instead drives its stories through misdirection and moral ambiguity to leave you questioning every character involved with this case. Although the story takes a while to pick up with its slow exposition during the first half, it powerfully builds up the layers of the characters and sets up for the rigid complexity of the story. Much of this pays off during the final stretch when the lead character Patrick and Angie are forced to confront against the demons that threaten their moral pedestals. And Affleck captures the events with pure grit and emotional magnitude with just enough tension leave viewers shivering in their seats. Setting the action in the middle-class Boston is perhaps no surprise as Affleck knows the town very well, but he also uses this location to great advantage by capturing the dour environment of a place riddled with crime, drugs, and prostitution. Once the events finally reach a conclusion, there is still a sense of uncertainty underlined by moral ambiguity of the characters. At the end, viewers are likely to find themselves divided on whether the character made the right decision or not. It comes to show that no goods come without punishment. As for Casey Affleck, he puts on a great performance. Though nothing I would consider Oscar-worthy, it effectively shows he has the acting chops he rarely gets the demonstrate unlike his older brother. Michelle Monaghan makes good use of her talent as well. Again, nothing that shouts for Oscars. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, unsurprisingly put on blissful performances. Arguably the most profound display in the roster is Amy Ryan who makes a convincing impression of a mother with a low-life persona who nonetheless is anxious of finding her daughter, even though her volatile personality does little to show it. The movie never lets any of its inspiring stars go to waste. Gone Baby Gone is a profoundly riveting mystery/thriller with a patent of powerhouse performances, an uncompromising package of snappy twists and turns, and a surprisingly strong directorial efforts by Ben Affleck. It is not a pretty picture, it is a dark one bound to leave even the most desensitized viewers squirming in their seats. Bloody is also a word not worth leaving out. Above all, it proves Affleck has just as much charismatic talent behind the camera as does in front.",9,2,3,19 September 2017
Southpaw," Smart, moving, and one of the most powerful films of the year
","Antoine Fuqua takes the directorial positions in this smart and moving sports drama that originally started off as an anticipated sequel to Eminem's biopic 8 Mile, before ultimately changing into a powerful boxing drama with Jake Gyllenhaal sporting the lead role. Gyllenhaal plays Billy Hope, a bold middle-weight boxing champion with a beautiful, loving wife Maureen (played by Rachel McAdams) and an adorable daughter eight-year old daughter named Leila (played by Oona Laurence). Maureen wants him to retire as she becomes increasingly concerned with his well being as he suffers various cuts and bruises on his face and forbids their daughter from watching him during the matches. One night at a charity event when Billy Hope's family is hit with an unexpectedly tragedy, his life plunges into a downward spiral. To matters, he eventually loses custody of his daughter and is left alone with no one turn to but former fighter Tick Willis (played by Forest Whitaker). In an effort to gain his life back, Billy enlists Willis to train him for a fight against Mexican boxer Miguel Escobar (played by Miguel Gomez) which will soon become the biggest boxing match of his life.Jake Gyllenhaal who gained a strong and super muscular build for his role blesses this movie with a powerhouse performance, even more impressive than his role in last year's Nightcrawler. Gyllenhaal just brings such immense energy and adrenaline in his character. His performance is a big stand out from the whole movie itself. Thanks to the brilliant script by Kurt Sutter, the movie presents a powerful and touching, but somewhat flawed story of the downfall of the main character's life when he loses one of his loved ones. The biggest disappointment comes not from the movie, but from the trailer gives a little too much away by revealing the tragic scene towards the beginning. Now there is no denying that the film is story does rely heavily on clichés from the other boxing films. However, the beautifully written screenplay may please audience enough to forgive the story's thin originality. This is also very emotionally charged, almost to where it feels manipulative. At the same time, you can't help but feel the powerful emotions for the main character not because the story tries to make you to, but because you want to. The characters are so well written that you care with them. The boxing scenes are some of the most realistic fights I have seen put together in a movie. Every punch you watch thrown, you can just feel the adrenaline in the characters and the sweat drenching their bodies, especially in the climatic fight scene towards the end, and the atmosphere is intense to the point where you would left glued to your seats.Southpaw is one of the best film of this year and I really hope it lands some Oscar nominations, particularly for Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. It is very smart, moving, and a must watch for not everyone, but mature viewers looking for a great movie.",8,1,2,26 October 2015
Ant-Man," Fun, action-packed Marvel adventure
","Here we are with another exciting action-packed thrill ride from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but with slightly more comedic relief than Marvel's previous outings like 'The Avengers' and 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2'. This new superhero adventure sees Paul Rudd expanding his talent into the action genre, portraying a tiny- sized hero full of charisma and charm. This time around, Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang, a former con man who is released from prison after serving a three-year sentence for robbery and arson. Upon his release, he struggles with securing employment to reconcile his relationship with his daughter. When he volunteers to participate in a heist with his friend and roommate Luis (played by Michael Pena) and his heist team to steal a bag of money, he ends discovering a mysterious suit and helmet that gives him to power to shrink to the size of an ant. He is soon enlisted by Hank Pym (played by Michael Kirk Douglas), the original owner of the suit who sees potential in Scott to make a difference while fearful of putting his daughter Hope (played by Evangeline Lilly) in danger against the powerful enemy Darren Cross (played by Corey Stoll) who possess a powerful suit known as Yellow Jacket.Upon seeing the trailer, it is understandable to find the concept a bit goofy. But with the Marvel Cinematic Universe expanding widely on the popularity scope, it wouldn't be a fair choice not to give his one a chance. With director Peyton Reed taking the traditional superhero elements and lowering the stakes for slightly more child-friendly superhero extravaganza, this film shines light on the much more light-hearted territory of the Marvel Universe. Playing the titular character is Paul Rudd who demonstrates a signature share of humor and charm in what is arguably one of the most likable heroes in the MCU has to offer. Delivering on the laughter with some gut-busting dialogue, Rudd never lets one moment go to waste, nor does he abandoned his great chemistry with co-stars Michael Pena as his roommate or Michael Douglas as the scientist with the quest to help Scott become the man he always dream about becoming. Then there is Corey Stoll who puts his darkly humorous mask on portray the villain Darren Cross. Though his performance stands strong, the context of in which his character is written doesn't quite the make the most memorable villain we are usually accustomed to in the Marvel films. Like many superhero flicks, this movie also leaves plenty of room for some larger-than-life visual effects that capture the eye in a heart beat. Audience are treated to a fair range of exciting action sequences with some eye-popping, most notably in the scenes when we watch as our hero shrinks down to size and navigates through the exceptionally large environments from his ant-sized perspective. It's safe to say these scenes are fun to watch, and the CGI is credible for this. Concluding the film is an intense, but silly action fight scene between our hero Ant-Man and the villain Yellow Jacket, delivered with an incredible special effects galore, all of which take place in the bedroom of Scott's young daughter; and are immensely fun to sit through.Ant-Man is a very entertaining addition to the Marvel a Cinematic Universe, and makes a terrific portrayal of our hero Ant-Man to the point where we can hope to see make another appearance not limited to a sequel, but also his debut appearance alongside the Avengers. This film is definitely a must-watch for all Marvel fans.",8,0,5,21 July 2015
21 Jump Street," Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum bring their infectious comedic chemistry to engulf us for a hilarious good time
","Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum band together in what appears to be yet another remake of a popular TV show of the same name. After a significant number of failed attempts to bring a televised source material to the big screen in an accurate fashion, it is understandable why people may approach this with low expectations. Against all odds, Hill and Tatum manage to bring their A-game to the table with their feverishly strong comedic appeal to grip us for an insanely hilarious comedic fare. Playing a duo of undercover cops with a diminishing sense of intelligence, these two make an irresistible pair for this devilishly raunchy buddy cop comedy directed by the likes of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who make a remarkable achievement of paying tribute to the popular source material while taking many liberties that create only a minimal resemblance of the 80s TV show. It is a movie that demands you to prepare for an all-out laugh-out-loud galore. This film follows Schmidt (played by Jonah Hill) and Jenko (played by Channing Tatum), two men reuniting seven years after their high school graduation to attend a local police academy. While their graduation is success, these two prove to be way too amateurish to properly execute their jobs at law enforcement officers after they manage to botch their first arrest. This leads to their boss Deputy Chief Hardy (played by Nick Offerman) to transfer them to, wait for it.....21 Jump Street, an underachieving police department run by the foul-mouthed Captain Dickson (played by Ice Cube) who assigns them on a case that sends them back to high school as undercover cops disguised as students to bust the school's drug dealer who happens to distributing some mind- altering substances. As the duo becomes engulfed in reliving their high school days including partying and school plays, their social life with the fellow students put their jobs in danger. This movie is not quite devoid of the typical buddy cop formula that has dominated the subgenre for the past few decades. But with the brilliant sleight of hand by the directors Phil Lord and Christoper Miller, a a solidly executed script, and the comedic adrenaline of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum; this movie works astonishingly well. It is funny almost consistently and rarely lets a single moment go to waste, even when the jokes border on the line of distasteful. And each time Hill and Tatum appear on screen, laughter almost immediately dominates the air as their chemistry allows us to relish in each scene. The script effectively blends its raunchy R-rated sex humor with clever messages about high school popularity and friendship, which come to productive use when the two leads get mixed with a crowd of high school cliques. In particularly, Jonah Hill's Schmidt forms a romance with cute blondie named Molly, played by Brie Larson, which comes to his surprise considering his lack of popularity in high school as demonstrated in the opening scene with him and the then-super- popular Jenko. Furthermore, the film also makes effective use of poking fun at high school stereotypes which accounts to some good laughs every now and then. But most importantly, it is the comedic performances by Hill and Tatum that keeps things flowing. And kudos should also go to Ice Cube who brings his foul-mouth, wise-cracking fever to the screen each minute we see him, and Rob Riggle who lets his comedic talent shine nearly every chance he gets. And when the characters finally get the chance to pull their guns out in the climax, viewers are treated with a sweet little cameo. 21 Jump Street is an exciting comedic endeavor that shows that Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum make an effective team when tackling the buddy cop genre. The movie is funny, charming, and blisters with seemingly endless comedic fever that will, of course, turn off those alienate by a long line of raunchy humor that comes at almost consistently. If can withstand the crudeness, come along for the ride.",9,0,1,24 September 2017
Captain America: The First Avenger," Tense, entertaining debut of Marvel hero Captain America
","Marvel Studios is absolutely no stranger to box office glory, and such has been proved since the debut of the Marvel Cinematic Universe beginning with 'Iron Man' in the summer of 2008. Whether the biggest appeal ignites from the charismatic special effects, the filmmakers' enigmatic ability to adapt the comics to the screen, or both of the above; the Marvel Cinematic Universe never fails to grip the attention of millions of fans around America and gained a highly spoken popularity status. And its success is not anticipated to reach stopping point anytime soon. This action blockbuster directed by Joe Johnston is no exception, introducing the patriotic superhero Captain America wielding an American flag- designed shield and where his story began. Set in the 1940s during World War II, Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers, a frustrated short lightweight weakling who enlists in the U.S army, but is consequently rejected due to his incompetence. His life changes when he is later recruited by Dr. Erskine (played by Stanley Tucci) and Colonol Chester Phillips (played by Tommy Lee Jones) for a high-tech experiment that transforms him from a skinny '98 pound weakling' to a powerful superhuman suiting the identity of you guessed it -- Captain America. When Dr. Erskine is unexpectedly murdered by Johann Schimdt a.k.a. Red Skull (played by Hugo Weaving), head of a secret Nazi corporation, Captain America is assigned to take him down.This film is about the same kind of popcorn flick you would expect of the other Marvel cinematic entries, and relatively the same appeal. This science-fiction action thriller carries on its charisma with the amazing performance by Chris Evans who stands out with diligence in the role of titular hero as well as the fantastic Hugo Weaving as the prominent villain Red Skull, and it's faithful justice to the comic books. Captain America makes out to be an easily likable with both pros and flaws while less. Unlike most superheroes though, Captain America gives no second thoughts before killing his enemies, similar to his portrayal in the comics. As the story takes place during the height of World War II, the film carries a theme of patriotism with some political commentary dealing with war in the European front, and and it fits with the story somewhat well. The story is decently paced and rarely sports a dull moment, though it has some minor flaws sprinkled throughout its run, most particular the villain Red Skull who's a little memorable than the most of the Marvel villains. Nonethless, the film leaves the rest of its appeal to spectacular action sequences punctuated by charming special effects, and the occasional humor from the supporting cast.Captain America: The First Avenger is a tense, solid, and entertaining addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a soulful introduction to the titular hero. This is as film that many Marvel fans can't be help but be pleased with. Is it what I called one of the best of the Marvel films? Probably not. But it certainly appealing and a fun superhero blockbuster that delivers well and defines the career of the main star Chris Evans.",7,0,0,22 April 2016
American Hustle," An enchanting piece of filmmaking
","Director David O. Russell brings life to this crime-dramedy based on a real-life scandal that took place in New York in the late 70s and early 80s. American Hustle features a stellar cast of Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner, Jennifer Lawrence, and Louis C.K. The plot follows Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser, a duo of con-artists who are unexpectedly dragged by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) into an operation against corrupt government officials, including Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), mayor of Camden, New Jersey. Jennifer Lawrence plays Rosalyn Rosenfield, the eccentric wife of Irving Rosenfield, who gets involved in a love triangle between her and Sydney Prosser. Louis C.K. plays Stoddard Thorsen, Richie DiMaso's boss. While all the characters are fictional, most of them are based on the real-life people that were involved in the events this film follows.American Hustle is an enchanting and beautifully written film, David O. Russell does a magnificent job on bringing a story of political corruption to life. As the film goes on, the plot moves very well and steady, and propels with some darkly funny moments and solid dialogue from its talented cast. However, I can't say that was fully entertained by the story. The story does have its moments of complexities that fall somewhat incoherent. Fortunately, the plot never loses its energy. Eventually the story reaches a point where everything starts make sense and gives viewers the opportunity to grasp a stronger understanding. Aside from this, the characters and performances is made what really make the film shine. Christian Bale puts on an amazing performance as Irving Rosenfield. The immense effort Bale latches on to prepare for this role is something of true astonishment, by gaining forty pounds and maintaining a flabby physique, very opposite to the method acting technique he used in 'The Machinist' when he lost an absurd amount of weight to play an insomniac machine operator. Amy Adams is also impressive in her role, probably her best role in her career. Bradley Cooper does well as the FBI agent, sporting a rare 70s curly hairstyle to resonate with the story's setting. Jennifer Lawrence's performance is definitely the best out of all. Her character was quite interesting because how unpredictable she was and her eccentric personality. Her character was very similar in some ways to her character in Silver Lining Playbook (2012), which won her an Oscar for Best Actress. These actors demonstrate some engaging chemistry between each other, and show great appeal to what viewers can describe as 'charming'.American Hustle maybe one of 2013's best films. The film presents brilliant performances, great story, and an incredible production design. I am quite surprised this film didn't win any Oscars, although it was nominate for ten. This film is probably the high point of the most of the actors' and actresses' career.",9,0,4,3 July 2015
The Bourne Ultimatum," Paul Greengrass grants Jason Bourne with the finest treatment yet
","Paul Greengrass concludes the trilogy with the most portrayal of our action hero Jason Bourne yet. After being introduced to the titular character in 2002, audiences everywhere experienced a major game changer for Matt Damon as he demonstrated a high-octane performance. The first installment introduced the CIA agent with an intense character study of a man with a loss memory and trying to recover his past that made him the gun- totting assassin he is. The sequel continued the story with more hyperkinetic action and thrills. Paul Greengrass however, ignited the real deal in this third installment. Concluding with some explosive action sequences while balancing a polished narrative heft, this film achieves the rare accolade of improving on both it's first and second predecessor -- something -- it is difficult to point out any aspect this doesn't improve on. So this film follows Jason Bourne who's once again stripped away from his peaceful life, to search for CIA official Neal Daniels (played by Colin Stinton) who happens to be in possession of valuable information that holds secrets to his past. During his mission, Bourne must also dodge vicious assassins appointed by Operation Treadstone director Noah Visen (played by David Straithairn) to hunt him down despite the orders of CIA Deputy director Pamela Landy (played by Joan Allen) who suggest them leave him be. This all comes down to a mission that defines the very person Jason Bourne. Paul Greengrass continues his immersive style congruent to what we brought in 'Bourne Supremacy', only much better. From the energetic camera-work, the compelling action sequences, an intriguing storyline, and his overall covered direction all come together to conclude the film trilogy with a bang. The film opens with a tense action scene with Jasom Bourne on a train, and following this is a suspenseful airport scene where he comes face- to-face with British journalist Simin Ross (played by Paddy Considine) in an operation that quickly sets the story in motion. The sequence is both tension-filled and shot very beautifully but this is only the beginning. The story continues through an extraordinary journey of visceral character developments, realistic hand-to-hand combat (shot with slightly better camera-work than in the previous film), and a plot with interesting nuances about the characters including Julia Kate who's character is now granted a more prominent role than in the previous entries. By the end, it all comes down to Jason Bourne discovering the true meaning of his past and how he became the ruthless CIA agent we know him for. Is there anything the story leaves unexplored? Maybe, but hardly anything crucial is left abandoned here. And the result is something truly fascinating.The Bourne Ultimatim is a spectacular conclusion to the Bourne trilogy, and this is all thanks to both the compelling performance by lead Matt Damon as well as Paul Greengrass's stunning directorial efforts. This is easily one of the best action films of it's decade, it not only places Greengrass in the front ranks of action filmmakers but also leaves a landmark on the action flick genre.",10,2,3,31 July 2016
Fargo," An amazing achievement by the Coen brothers
","This dark comedy based on real-life events is the movie that defined the Coen brothers as the influential filmmakers they are today. With their incredible writings and their wittiness of genre-mixing, these two have made one of the most recognizable names in Hollywood. set in the snowy town of Fargo, North Dakota, this film stars William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, a car dealer obsessed with being wealthy who hires a duo of ruthless criminals Carl Showalter (played by Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grismud (played by Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife Jean and exchange her for a large amount of money by her father. Before too long when the plan goes terribly wrong and turns into a bloodbath, this heinous crime gains the attention of a pregnant police officer Margo Gunderson (played by Frances McDormand) who comes into investigation. What comes from this crime story is some amazing performances by a talent cast, a polished screenplay, and some of the most elegantly written characters ever put to screen.As this is a Coen brothers film, instead of conveying a straight dark tone, this film illustrates a dark and gritty story with a touch of humor sprinkled throughout its story. And with no little surprise, the Coen brothers achieve this quite well. From the opening scene, we are introduced to William H. Macy's character who is quickly learn is up to no good, and does compelling job at hiding his mischievousness from his wife and son. Nearly every scene of his presence is unpredictable and leaves you attention glued to him. Macy really stands out in this role and makes himself a good name for playing such a despicable husband and father his character is. The real fun however, occurs during the scenes of the two criminals played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stomare, from the scene of kidnapping the main character's wife to the astonishing climax at the end. The story grows increasingly engaging and dark in the amidst of it's satirical tone, and every scene these two are in hits the right notes, whether they make you laugh or have you shocked to the edge of your seat. These two give such dazzling performances, especially Steve Buscemi who fits just right in his character considering his role he portrayed in Quentin Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs'. While these actors nail their roles, the biggest icing on the cake comes from Frances McDormand who gives a strong performance as the pregnant officer who goes on investigation of the crime. Standing as the most charismatic character, McDormand embraces her role diligently and never disappoints. It is no surprise her performance landed her an Academy Award.Fargo is a fun and entertaining experience, and the Coen brothers do a tremendous job. This a film with amazing performances, a spectacular screenplay, and well developed characters that stand strong. It is definitely one of the best works by the Coen brothers, and something every movie fanatic shouldn't miss. I am so ready to see their next film 'Hail Caeser!' as it now out in theaters this week.",9,0,0,8 February 2016
Rush," Superbly crafted biopic with an outstanding execution of human competition
","There's always an interesting story to be told, and with directors like Ron Howard, the mastermind behind the Academy Award-winning 'A Beautiful Mind', working behind the camera to bring these compelling tales to life; a powerful biopic supplemented with solid craftsmanship and stellar performances can only be expected. To all justice, Howard gracefully accomplishes this feat. Howard's telling of the historical events of the fierce competition between two Formula One racers comes off as a compelling thrill ride that not only feels original rather than your average sports underdog story, but also boasts plenty of substance as well as some graceful performances by its two likable leads including Chris Hemsworth of 'Thor' and Daniel Bruhl of 'Inglourious Basterds'. Set in the 1970s, this film tells the story of the rivalry between James Hunt (played by Chris Hemsworth), a handsome English Former One driver, and Niki Lauda (played by Daniel Bruhl), a methodical Austrian Formula One driver. WIth both men desperate of earning the championship title on the Grand Prix tracks, Hunt and Lauda go to great measures to outdo each other on and off the tracks in a fierce competition that threatens to not only hit the brakes on their careers, but destroy their own personal beings.This Ron Howard biopic is not an extraordinary picture, at least on the level of his magnum opus 'A Beautiful Mind'; but there is no doubt Howard sparks honest ambition in his translation of the compelling story of the legendary race car drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda to the silver screen. Teaming up with the fine director is Peter Morgan (previous collaborator with Howard in 'Frost/Nixon') who breathes strong energy in the story with his screenplay. As the beautifully crafted plot sprawls through the friction between the two lead characters, we are introduced the complexities that define who these two are and builds up their labyrinthine relationship. Neither of them come as heroes as they both demonstrate flaws that conflict with not only each other but also themselves and their loved ones, one of which is thinly demonstrated in James Hunt's unrest relationship with his wife Suzy Miller (played by Olivia Wilde). Arguably the biggest irony that comes between their rivalry is the respect the two eventually gain for each other towards the final stretch, especially after one of them is involved in a horrible accident; and Ron Howard makes solid effort on illustrating this without executing it in a way that feels contrived. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl are both phenomenal in their roles, and the performances they are the driving source of the film's emotional resonance. And lets not forget the slickly edited racing sequences which provide the thrills and exhilaration, though one of them take place in the rain which ends in not-too-pretty results.Rush is superbly crafted blessed with an outstanding execution by director Ron Howard and screenwriter Peter Morgan, and demonstrates an incredible deliverance of powerhouse performances by Hemsworth and Bruhl. This is brilliantly crafted film that does not require the viewers to be fans of Formula One Racing(or any motor sports for that matter) to appreciate. Overall, this film certainly delivers what it needs to.",9,0,1,1 November 2016
Nightcrawler," Thoughtfully engaging and swarming with brainy social commentary, Nightcrawler is an absorbing punch
","Nightcrawler is one of those rare thrillers with more intelligent to offer than just a wind of heart-thumping thrills and atmosphere. As a matter of fact, this film directed by the likeness of Dan Gilroy, is less about delivering thrills than having something smart to say about the culture of mass media. In a world where mass media has taken some questionable measures on delivering the news of what is going around the country and around the world, there has plenty of wonder what goes on behind the curtains the news network, and very few answers. With the news media revolutionized over the last several decades and ethics twisted to mysterious measures, this film places actor Jake Gyllenhaal in a thought-provoking character study of a man tackling the enigmatic world of journalism. And the result of Dan Gilroy's thoughtful direction and screenplay is an unpredictable ride dazzled with plenty of food for thought. This film follows Louis Bloom (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), a Los Angeles native stuck on the employment sidelines and making money off of selling scrap metal he steals from strangers. Before too long, he takes interest in filming crime scenes and selling his footage to a local news station run by the ambitious Nina Romina (played by Rene Russo). With her news station improving in business and Bloom's filming talent reaching new heights, he hires Rick (played by Riz Ahmed) as his partner. But with his charismatic talent growing, Bloom begins to cross the lines between right and wrong in an effort to deliver the news the city of Los Angeles is asking for. This film is a smart cinematic treat that has a lot to say about the what goes behind the scenes of television news networks, and it all begins with: The news is a dirty business. And thanks to Dan Gilroy's directing chops and intellectually engaging narrative, this film has a nifty way to supporting this claim. The central figure of this story is Jake Gyllenhaal's Louis Bloom, an antisocial individual who strays on the wrong side of the moral compass the minute he is introduced on screen, and develops into a mysteriously corrupt entity on both the moral and ethical department upon entering the news business. He is significantly manipulative, and his partnership with Rene Russo's Nina Romina and Riz Ahmed's Rick accounts to some shocking and corrupt situations. Is he a likable person? Definitely not. But he's an interesting character who serves as an allusion of how mass media in our country is today. In an era where the news media has evolved with a bigger concern on garnering high ratings than feeding the truth of what's go around the world, the film fiddles with the message 'If it bleeds, it leads' and places it into sharp perspective. The stunning outcome is a story with both an absorbing atmosphere and a brain. Jake Gyllenhaal in particularly, is another spot in his flick. Maintaining a gaunt figure and bugsy eyes, Gyllenhaal gives a sweeping performance that thoroughly suits his character's callous personality and mystifying nature. Nightcrawler is a thoughtfully engaging ride shining with plenty of wit and thrills from Dan Gilroy's direction and writing, along with a striking delivery by Jake Gyllenhaal that sheds light on his acting chops. It is an entertaining hit on both a narrative and visual perspective. That is of course for those who bother to take interest in the sociological subject matter.",8,0,0,22 February 2015
Léon: The Professional," Luc Besson's The Professional is powerfully crafted with sophistication and stunning fortitude that strikes hard
","From French director Luc Besson, Leon: The Professional is an action film with a little more to bargain than a just a plethora of explosive action set pieces. It is a part-drama that strives for a sheer exploration in its characters and how their lives are changed when everything goes downhill. The alarming question implemented in this story is what would you be willing to do to protect someone who has seemingly lost everything. The answers lie within Besson's chillingly crafted action vehicle which bears a story of a relationship between a man with demons burning inside him and a preteen girl lost in a world of inconspicuous innocence, and their relationship is the emotional crux that activates the film's momentum. Making up the duo is French-born actor Jean Reno and young actress Natalie Portman, a youngster making her feature film debut. The performances along with Besson's uncompromising direction makes not a comfortable ride, but one that is nearly unforgettable. This film follows Leon (played by Jean Reno), an Italian-born immigrant and professional hit-man working under mobster Tony (played by Danny Aiello), who meets Mathilda (played by Natalie Portman), a lonely 12-year old girl living under the harsh conditions of her abusive father (played by Michael Badalucco), her snappy mother, her equally older sister, and her younger brother who seems to be only pleasant seed in the family. Mathilda spends her days smoking on the balcony and looking for work to do. When Leon witness the brutal murder of her family at the hands of gun-wielding goons lead by mob boss Stansfield (played by Gary Oldman), Leon reluctantly takes her under his wing and teaches her the basics of becoming a professional assassin. Along the way, an unexpected platonic relationship forms between the two.Many actions film set out to entertain audiences with explosive special effects and hyperkinetic atmosphere, but not in a way that this film does. Luc Besson eludes against the common action formula in favor for a more art-house approach, a method that transcends the movie into something more thoughtful, if not masterful. Besson is not quick to just jump straight into the action and lead the scene with loud, heart-stopping gun shootouts. He takes his steady time to dive deep into the characters including establishing their backgrounds and compound personalities, while accompanying the scenery with a riveting score by Eric Serra. The eponymous character Leon is portrayed as a man with brutality written on his forehead. He is a man who shoots and kills to survive against the evildoers who wrong him. But deep inside the mysterious man is a gentle soul who wishes for a peaceful life. His is solidly exhibits in scenes showing his loves for plants and of course, in more light-hearted scenes with Natalie Portman's Mathilda. When the two finally eventually form their bond, that is when the story strikes at the heart. Easily making their relationship uncomfortable to grasp would obviously be their hefty age difference, yet that is what makes things more interesting. Reno's performance really hits hard in soft scenes when he and Portman are bonding, as well as the more grim moments when he shows off his gripping ferocity when he is mowing down the bad guys. Along his side is Portman who, for her surprisingly young age, brightens the room with a gritty portrayal that wrings out maturity and humanity of her character. And the duo must come face-to-face with Stansfield who is granted with a vicious, yet enticingly strong portrayal by Gary Oldman. The tension between him and the title character greatly pays its dues in climatic action sequence at the end when the body count hits the towers and each character faces a blind date with fate. Leon: The Professional is a powerfully crafted action-drama hybrid by Luc Besson who takes the action genre and spins into a visceral cinematic treat. Besson proves himself as a filmmaker capable to wringing out true heart from a genre filled populated with big- budget action parades. It is an admirable piece of work, at least for those who can get past the violent nature of the story.",9,4,4,16 July 2017
Burn After Reading," Burn After Reading is dark, funny, and solidly smart with a wise direction
","This satirical dark comedy isn't terribly astonishing or groundbreaking in any way, but being another outing from the Coen Brothers, the masterminds behind films like 'Blood Simple', 'Raising Arizona', 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski', and their most critically acclaimed 'Fargo'; it is difficult to resist the curiosity of this darkly funny picture. From beginning to end, it comes clear that Joel and Ethan Coen still have the smart and talent they brought have to the screen since their debut in 1984 with Blood Simple. Starring an all-star cast of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, and Tilda Swinton; this intelligent dramedy piece mixes the directors' signature style of humor and violence, with a decently crafted plot to keep viewers engaged. In the end, viewers will have experienced another triumphant piece of cinema by the efforts of the Coen Brothers. The film enters John Malkovich as Osbourne Cox, a Balkan CIA agent who is resigned from his position due to his alcoholism, and decides his best chance of making money is through starting a writing career. He types up a memoir of his life and saves it on a disc which is unexpectedly found in the hands of Fitness manager Linda Litzke (played by Frances McDormand) and her assistant Chad Feidheimer (played by Brad Pitt). The two dimwits make a desperate attempt to sale it for money, but end up involved a series of unfortunate circumstances including a dangerous encounter with Harry Pfareer (played by George Clooney), a man who Osbourne's wife Katie (played by Tilda Swinton) is secretly seeing. If you've followed through the Coen Brothers' filmography, you are likely to be aware of some their trademarks including their aestheticization of dark, morbid humor and idiosyncratic characters -- both of which are encompasses in this; and like in their previous work, it is all done with the directors' beautiful writing and style of direction. The plot, though nothing special, is beautifully crafted and moves at an appropriately steady pace. As the plot goes on, it spends just enough time to develop the not-so-smart characters while setting up some unpredictable thrills that are bound to take you by surprise, some of which end in bloody results. While there isn't too much thrills to experience, there are a fair amount of laughs to endure not just from the darkly humorous dialogue through the characters' stupidity in confronting dangerous situations. Yes, the characters are dumb and the movie is aware of this, but they're also charismatic thanks to the Coen Brothers ingenious writing. Frances McDormand, Joel Coen's wife and frequent collaborator of the brothers' filmography, comes out on top above the cast, delivering an endearing performance; perhaps even more so than her Oscar-winning as the pregnant police chief in 'Fargo'. This actress bring immense charm and humanity to her character. By the end, it is say safe she steals the show. Brad Pitt is also very appealing in his role, both funny and intriguing in a way that makes his character not stand out, but decently likable. George Clooney and John Malkovich are also granted their time to shine here, and the same can be expressed about Tilda Swinton as the wife of John Malkovich's character. While I can't say their performances fall in the Oscar calibur, they are with all honesty, difficult not to admire. Burn After Reading is immensely entertaining with tremendous performances, an engrossing direction by Joel and Ethan Coen, a beautifully crafted plot, and a fair share of hilarity mixed with a dark atmosphere. This movie offers just another decent opportunity to experience the extravagant filmmaking that makes the Coen Brothers two of the most acclaimed filmmakers in the realm of cinema. In fair words, this one is definitely recommended.",8,1,2,25 August 2016
Watchmen," Powerful on visuals and performances, deeply flawed on storytelling
","From director Zack Snyder, the man behind the visually stunning historical epic '300', comes a dark, complex vigilante thriller based on the acclaimed comic book series by DC comics. This film set in 1985 during the height of the Cold War, follows a league of superheros: masked vigilante Rorschach (played by Jackie Earle Haley), techno expertise Nite Owl II (played by Patrick Wilson), glowing blue- skinned being Dr. Manhattan (played by Billy Cruddup), Silk Spectre II (played by Malin Akerman), and former black-ops specialist known as The Comedian (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan); who are shut down by the government after a political meltdown. However, when one of their former members is brutally murdered, the superheros step out of retirement to solve the mystery behind the criminal responsible of this horrendous act. On the other hand, their investigation is challenged when tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union heat up to the point of an anticipated nuclear world that is set to devastate the world.This is not your average superhero film that some come to expect. Instead of glamorizing with flashy action sequences and profound special effects, this film conveys a dark tone that makes even other DC films like the Dark Knight trilogy seem light-hearted, and dwells heavily on plot development with action making up only a minority of the storyline. This film, however, juggles two stories at the same time; one centering on the band of superheroes going under investigation of a murder of one of their own, and the other revolving around a looming global disaster by a nuclear war between two rivaling countries, with plenty of political and historical commentary, much of which is introduced in slow motion cut-outs during the opening credits with Bob Dylan's popular song ' The Times They Are Changin' playing. The result, unfortunately, is one bloated plot that transcends into a convoluted mess. The plot move at a significantly slow pace and we are left with plenty of plot elements that never seem to add up. The connection between the government conspiracy and the murder of one of the former Watchmen is left unclear, or at least understated. Along the side, the story tosses numerous subplots to the table that fail to fit in with the main story, especially the ones dealing with the Cold War conflicts including the Vietnam War. Many may the impressive visual effects and the occasional bloody action scenes that upload in various points of the runtime. Some of the futuristic and fantasy imagery serves as eye-candy in many scenes including the stunning CGI on Dr. Manhattan's body. The performances by the cast are decent, especially by Billy Cruddup who plays Dr. Manhattan, which delivers some redeeming value to the film.Watchmen is by no means a bad film but rather one that is terribly misguided. While the visuals and performances stand strong, the film suffers greatly in terms of storytelling, thus lacking the spirit of Zack Snyder's other works. The overly complex plot may appeal to some whether or not they are able to comprehend it, but leave others sorely disappointed.",5,3,5,16 February 2016
The Bourne Identity," Tense, thrilling, and purely entertaining with Matt Damon as the action hero
","In 1962, Hollywood introduced British spy James Bond who made an iconic name in the action genre, and the legacy of this household action hero continues today through the longest running film franchise In the 1980s, we were introduced to Bruce Willis' John McClane, a New York cop who served justice as he took a dozen of German terrorists at the Nakatomi Plaza one by one, and his astonishing charisma has lead to a spawn of a few sequels. Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is what some describe as just a modern day James Bond. But with a powerful portrayal by Damon, he feels more like an original character, a spy agent with a highly trained set of fighting skills in both gun and hand-to- hand combat. In this spy action thrilled directed by Doug Liman, Matt Damon steps into what is arguably his most charismatic role aside from his Oscar-nominated performance in 'Good Will Hunting'. Damon plays the title character Jason Bourne, a CIA agent who wakes up on a boy after being rescued by a group of fisherman. Suffering from amnesia and covered in bullet wounds, he travels to Switzerland where he uses his old bank account to put together the puzzle pieces of his identity. He is soon assisted by German woman Marie (played by Franka Potente) to search for his identity but soon find himself by hunted down by ruthless assassins by Black Ops agent Alexander Conklin (played by Chris Cooper). Bourne must escape from the vicious criminals while searching for answers to what they want him for. Not very many action flicks offer a spectacular mix of tense action and mystery like this action thriller. From the hyper-kinetic action sequences, to it's slick editing, to the highly compelling plot, to the overall likability of the lead character; this film stops at almost nothing to deliver the strong, visceral experience viewers come to root for. In an age where many films of the action genre struggle to find a solid balance of both action and coherent plot development, this one manages to stand out. The plot moves through the title character's search of his identity and the conspiracy that surrounds, and what ensues is a nice array of tension and unpredictable scenes. The fiercest moments show Jason Bourne engaging in brutal martial arts combat against the baddies, complete with stunning choreography and camera-work that, while a bit shaky, successfully express the intensity of the scenes. One of the most intense moments lies in a beautifully shot staircase shootouts scene. The film definitely has a sweet taste in action, and it delivers quite well especially with Matt Damon who's quite energizing vibrant in the lead role. Franka Potente is also very strong as her character who makes a competent supporting character rather than a typical damsel-in-distress. Praise can also be given to Chris Cooper as the main villain. He may not serve as a memorable antagonist, but that's not the point as the lead character's primary goal is not to capture or kill the villain but to search for the reason why he (the antagonist) trying to take him down.The Bourne Identity is tense, thrilling, and purely entertaining experience for action fans everywhere. This film is easily a household name in Matt Damon's career as well as the action genre of the 2000s. For all looking for a great popcorn flick, this one is worth checking out.",8,3,3,28 July 2016
Baby Driver," Fast, frenetic, and swarming with wit -- Edgar Wright's Bady Driver is a total joyride
","You can always count on Edgar Wright to load his films with plenty of good humor and wit. When tackling the action genre, Wright proves more than capable of splashing the screen with immense laughter and intelligence without tossing its thrills aside -- a common problem among many entries of the genre. Baby Driver is a movie that gets the blood pumping the minute it open, while staying almost consistently entertaining following the near two-hour proceeding. When it gets down to the action, it is pulse-pounding. When it gets down to the talking, it is funny. And like his previous projects, Wright happens to run with a style-over-substance vibe. Whereas some films it serves as a detriment to the final product, here it is almost profoundly satisfying . Mixing a hodgepodge of adrenaline- fueled action and humor with a killer soundtrack, Wright knows how to give the audiences a blast without sacrificing intellect. This film follows Baby (played by Ansel Egdorf), a twenty-something year old man working as a getaway driver for his team consisting of Griff (played by Jon Bernthal), Buddy (played by Jon Hamm), and Darling (played by Eiza Gonzalez) to rob banks for his mob boss Doc (played by Kevin Spacey). Baby proves to be a highly skilled driver with his ability to escape the cops and pull off outrageous stunts while slaving his ears to music on his iPod. At night, he is at home taking care of his deaf foster father Joseph (played by C.J. Jones). After finishing what is intended to be his last job, Baby falls for a beautiful waitress named Deborah (played by Lily James). When he gets call back for one last job with his new consisting of Griff, Darling, and a tough-as-nails gangster named Bats (played by Jamie Foxx), things get dangerous very quick. Edgar Wright operates this film in a way that boasts plenty of style and smarts from its opening minute. From the frenetic action sequences, to the snappy dialogue, to the smoking hot soundtrack -- this film is brimming with cleverness. In the opening scene showcasing the characters' escape from the cops following a bank robbery, Wright proves to be highly skilled at shooting action scenes and editing them with precision. Rather than chopping the scene up with split-second cuts, Wright captures the full frenetic energy of the scene as the lead character races through the streets while scurrying through semi- heavy traffic. This is when he starts a song from the 70s or 80s on his iPod. To add to the mix, Wright effectively choreographs these scenes in a fashion that matches up with the beat of the music, one scene involving a gunfight in which he performs this flawlessly. The final results are car chases injected with more substance than what we are often accustomed to in the 'Fast and Furious' movies. And like Wright's previous flicks, there is some unexpected moments of gore. When Baby is not dodging the cops or unleashing the bullets, the film takes it time to treat viewers with some funny dialogue, particularly when Jamie Foxx comes on screen. Exhibiting a darkly funny streak, Foxx breaths some comedic gold in his role, delivering one snappy one-liner after another. He is often the power source for laughs. Ansel Egdorf, stepping into his first high-octane role, is suitably appealing as the lead character with an upsetting past that this otherwise light- hearted picture sporadically explores. His romance is with Lily James is charming, but perhaps nothing sizzling. Nonetheless, it is become rarer and rarer for action comedies nowadays to uproot characters we truly care about, particularly one trying to battle his inner demons when caught in a dangerous situation. Then there is Kevin Spacey just being himself like in nearly other role he's endeavored.Baby Driver is a high-octane action comedy that knows how to deliver both the fun and intellectual touch. In the summer with superhero flicks and other highly anticipated pictures arriving on the scene, this is a film that may not see too much sunshine at the box office. Regardless, this movie is a total blast that deserves the attention of many, especially those converted to the Edgar Wright fandom.",9,20,39,30 June 2017
Justice League," Of course, Justice League is not the strongest entry in the DC Cinematic Universe, but for its grandeur sleek visual style and energy, it nonetheless hits the jackpot
","Assembling DC comics's most icon heroes into an alliance of Earth's mightiest defenders, Justice League sets stone to another attempt to pull the DC Cinematic Universe out of the ruts dug by two of their vastly disappointing entries 'Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice' and 'Suicide Squad'. Fortunately, last summer's 'Wonder Woman' was able to accomplish that. For the good news, this film succeeds on demonstrating that the cinematic universe is far from out of the game. On the other hand, it fails to reach the peak of 'Wonder Woman', which is almost predictable considering that film set a high bar for how superhero entries should operate. From visual and acting standpoint, the movie hits a home-run, which only renders it slightly disappointing that the narrative undergoes a blemished Returning as director is Zack Snyder who injected his project with his signature visual style before Joss Whedon, one of the writers, took over for some reshoots after Snyder was forced to step down following a family tragedy. And the evidence of the two directors colliding with their dissimilar approaches shines significantly obvious. This film follows Bruce Wayne (played by Ben Affleck) who pairs up the reluctant Diane Prince a.k.a. Wonderman (played by Gal Gadot) to rally up a team of meta-humans including Barry Allan/TheFlash (played by Ezra Miller), Arthur Curry/Aquaman (played by Jason Momoa), and Vincent Stone/Cyborg (played by Ray Fisher) to stand as the last line of defense against the evil monster Steppenwolff (voiced by Ciaran Hinds), an otherworldly emperor set to wipe out mankind. Meanwhile, the team along with Lois Lane (played by Amy Adams) and Martha Kent (played by Diane Lane) mourn the loss of Superman (played by Henry Cavill) who made an ultimate during the battle against Doomsday. As exciting as it is, Justice League is perhaps not the saving hand for the DCEU in the fracture state it is following its previous entries, as 'Wonder Woman' already holds that title. Nonetheless, it feels quite refreshing to say that this rendition of the popular ensemble team of superheroes is not a hot mess. Director Zack Snyder breathes his trademark visual methodology in each frame while pumping excitement into the heart-racing action set pieces. And much like his previous project, CGI makes a dominating appearance, for both better and worse, and plays a major role in feasting the eyes with a sleek visual scope. Perhaps I should not forget the heavy use slow-mo sequences. But the flaws lying within recent entries in the cinematic universe lead audiences, especially fans to the impressing question how soundness of the plot. To say the least, there are some noteworthy flaws, but it is most certainly not messy. Occuping the first half-hour is the introduction of each character and establishing their arcs. Some are more stronger than others. While Wonder Woman is introduced an exhilarating sequence involving her thwarting a bank robbery, the rest of characters are restrained to expository scenes establishing their backstories without getting their time to shine long until the climatic sequence, which the film rushes into rather sloppily, when are they forced to band together against Steppenwolf who sits as arguably the weakest aspect of the narrative. As a villain, this CGI-constructed monster is rather generic and lacks a concrete background beyond desiring to wipe out the universe. What is his motivation? The answer is left out of our reach, and seemingly the heroes as well. Ciaran Hinds' voice performance is the best thing we get out of his baddie. Building a solid team of heroes requires not only solid character arcs, which are sadly lacking in some, but the charisma of the cast members. Fortunately, Ben Affleck who introduced himself as Batman in the disappointing foray that was 'Batman V. Superman' remains appealing as ever as the dark cape crusador. Of course, he never quite holds the title of the show stealer as that is given to Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman who has already established herself as a warmly charismatic female hero in her stand-alone entry from last summer. She is gifted with the most memorable moments among the rest of the cast. Jason Momoa, playing the aquatic-type hero Aquaman, stands likable and holds a fair spirit in the role. His most memorable lies not within the actions sequences, but in a laugh- worthy expository sequence where he comes in contact with Wonder Woman's lasso of truth. Ray Fisher is fine as Cyborg who unfortunately falls victim to a weak backstory that places his appeal in severe constraints. Playing the speedy hero in a red lightning suit is Ezra Miller as the Flash, who tries to capture the comedic spirit of Tom Holland in 'Spiderman: Homecoming' by going gonzo with goofy one-liners that unfortunately wear out their welcome long before the film reaches it climax, not to mention his clammy dialogue. Finally, it is no spoiler that Superman make his return after the character was butchered with an unforeseen death in 'Batman V. Superman'. That is when Henry Cavill comes to the picture, and he is fine as ever. But don't expect too much screen time from him. The heroes make a fair chemistry, but their comedic muscles are rather dull as they try to sustain Joss Whedon's light- hearted approach while flowing through the slightly darker tone of Zack Snyder's direction that was remains in scenes outside of Whedon's reshot sequences. That is not to say that we do not get a few great Whedon-esque laughs.Justice League most certainly does to reach the high bar established by 'Wonder Woman' nor does it mark a single turning point for the DC Cinematic Universe. But what is accomplishes, it offers a fun thrill ride to feast the hearts of comic book fans as well as everyone else craving for a sweet exercise in the superhero realm. As for the DCEU, the franchise is miles away from reaching the height of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that is if it has a chance.",7,0,3,21 November 2017
Man of Steel," Man of Steel is better than you might imagine
","Superman, one of the most iconic superheroes in the history of comic books, comes to live in this action-packed reboot. Directed by Zack Snyder of 300 (2007) and Watchmen (2009), Man of Steel follows the origin story of Clark Kent (played by Henry Cavill) when he was a child sent to Earth, after his home planet Krytonite is invaded by General Zod (played by Michael Shannon) and his troops. As a child, Clark quickly gains his superpowers, but struggles to deal with how they change him as a person. Clark grows up to become Superman and fend off against General Zod, who arrives on Earth in attempt to destroy mankind. This film was very entertaining and fun to watch. While it is not on the level of the Dark Knight trilogy, I was satisfied with this movie.I am very concerned by the negativity this film received from critics and audiences. Many didn't like this because of the origin story. I enjoyed the origin story because of how it shows how Clark Kent became Superman. I never knew he was born from another planet. While some are familiar with Superman's origin story from watching the television series Smallville (2001), this film does a good job at showcasing it for those who may not be familiar with it. The pacing may feel a bit rushed with the way it jumps from the origin story to the action, but I don't feel it hurt the film too much. Secondly, I enjoyed the action sequences; the visual effects and special effects were great like in Zack Snyder's other movies. Henry Cavill did an alright job as Superman. Michael Shannon also did pretty well as the main villain.Man of Steel does have its flaws here and there, but it is better than you might think. Don't let the negative reviews stop you from watching this.",8,2,6,8 June 2015
Cast Away," Fantastic film about loss and survival
","Director Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks reunite after working together in the 1994 Oscar-winning film Forrest Gump. Setting the two-time Oscar winning actor in a powerful story of survival and hope, this adventure delivers a story that embraces an intense and emotional character study of a stripped away from his comfortable life on civilization and casted out in a lonely world where only the strong-willed survive. The film stars Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland, a FedEX executive who goes on a business trip overseas. However, when his plane caught into a nasty storm and crashes, killing everyone on board except him, he finds himself stranded on a deserted island thousands of miles away from home and his girlfriend Kelly (played by Helen Hunt). With no one to contact for help, Chuck must test his physical, emotional, and mental skills to survive on a deserted island until someone comes and finds him. In the process, he finds a volleyball in an undelivered FedEX package. After cutting his hand, he gives the ball a face using his bloody hand print and befriends the ball as a companion, and names it 'Wilson'.Robert Zemeckis blesses this film with an ingenious script and story telling, and Tom Hanks delivers an endearing performance as the main character. This film deals with a man with finds himself loss on a deserted island with absolutely no contact with any individuals, and must transform himself to a new person to survive a place where there is no 'real' food, technology, or communication. How Tom Hanks' character develops is quite amazing and really moves the story along at a fairly effective pace. As the story progresses, his body becomes thin, his grows an excessive amount of facial hair to where he resembles a cave man, and his meals are reduced to crabs and fish he catches in the sea. He also begins having verbal conversations with a volleyball as a way coping with his loneliness. While there is little excitement to experience, the film always managing to keep the story alive and moving, and all this thanks to its captivating screenplay by William Broyles Jr. There are some emotional points towards the second half that have the potential of making sensitive viewers shed a few tears. Luckily these scenes are done in a manner that allow viewers to express emotions rather than manipulate them into sadness.Cast Away is Robert Zemeckis's best film behind Forrest Gump and Back To The Future. It is a film that tells a brilliant story of survival, courage, and loss. How this film didn't receive any Oscar nominations other than Best Actor and Best Sound surprise a bit. Overall, this movie is nonetheless satisfying.",9,0,0,21 October 2015
The Thing," John Carpenter's gory science-fiction/horror is brutally terrifying and not for the faint of heart
","John Carpenter, the filmmaker who sprung to success with his 1978 slasher flick 'Halloween', has taken on a new challenge. And the challenge is re-imagining terrifying John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella 'Who Goes There?'. Decades after the first film adaptation in the 50s, Carpenter has spawned a terrifying science-fiction/horror hybrid that blends a heavy amount of gruesome special effects with hair-raising tension and paranoia. The main antagonist of this freak show is an alien, but it's no ordinary alien like the ones from Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. It is an alien that can only be described as an abstract being that possesses the bodies of subconscious individuals, and the scariest part is you have no idea who the victim is. Carpenter brings a hefty hand at this nightmare-inducing ride, and results amount to one of the scariest cinematic endeavors of both of the horror and science- fiction genre. This film stars Kurt Russell as R.J MacReady, an American scientist who leads an expedition team including biologist Blair (played by A. Wilford Brimley), Nauls (played by T.K Carter), Palmer (played by David Clennon), Childs (played by Keith David), and Dr. Cooper (played by Richard Dysart) among other members on a research mission to a remote shelter in Antarctica. There, they witness the shooting a fluffy canine. When they take to dog to the shelter, it subsequently mutates into a grotesque parasitic monster that not only begins killing members of the team, but is secretly assimilating the bodies of other people in the shelter. So the mission becomes a battle for survival as the team grows paranoid of who's human.....and who's not.If you have a weak stomach to over-the-top blood and gore and aliens tearing through bodies in an aberrant fashion, this film is most certainly not for you. This bleak alien horror show eschews the conventional alien invasion concept in favor of a more grotesque mystery-type plot that owes elements to Jack Finney's classic novel 'Body Snatchers'. Carpenters sets the action in a dark, tension- fueled atmosphere where paranoia lurks around every corner as an alien parasite runs amok in a confined setting, and the character are trapped in a life-threatening guessing game of who's human and who's an alien life-form. This all accounts to an alarming struggle for survival with unpredictable twists and turns, and almost no moments of levity is spared. To add icing to the cake, the suspense is greatly toned up by an eerie music score by Ennio Mariconnie. Carpenter plants plenty of nightmare-inducing imagery to the screen, most of which carry inspiration from Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. Animals are mutated into grotesque looking monsters, limbs are torn off, and and stomachs open up in thoroughly unnatural manners. The cast which is greatly lead by Kurt Russell exhibits some fine performances, though the underdevelopment of their characters do not give them too much to work with. Nonetheless, Carpenter's masterful direction superbly makes for the minor flaws that ensue.The Thing is a frightening science-fiction horror piece that strikes at the heart with spine-chilling thrills and an excess amount of gore - - all of which amount to a thoroughly scary experience. While this film certainly shows its age, it still manages hold up to today's standards. This John Carpenter flick is worth your time, but only if you can digest the sheer gruesomeness of its material.",9,2,6,23 April 2017
Armageddon," A popcorn movie deluxe
","Michael Bay was one of those director I think is criticized too much and deserves more credit for his movies, especially this one. Bruce Willis plays Harry Stamper, a veteran astronaut who is informed by NASA of a Texas-sized asteroid heading towards Earth. In determination of saving mankind, Stamper gathers a group of blue-collar workers to drill a hole through the asteroid and set a nuclear bomb inside to blow up the asteroid before it crashes into Earth. This film features a stellar cast of actors including Ben Affleck, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, Billy Bob Thornton, Willaim Fichtner, Will Patton, Keith David, Peter Stormare, and Liv Tyler. This is one of Michael Bay's most enjoyable films. The plot is compelling and well written, the action scenes are great, and unlike most of Bay's films, this one has heart and emotional resonance. Critics were definitely wrong about this movie.I enjoyed the amazing cast this film features. Bruce Willis does okay as Harry Stamper, the main character, even though his casting is a bit off at various points. Liv Tyler does a great job as Grace, Harry Stamper's daughter who is in a relationship with blue-collar worker A.J Frost (played by Ben Affleck), despite her father's disapproval. The rest of the cast was really funny, cracking hilarious one-liners here and there, especially Steve Buscemi. Some people expressed negativity to this, mostly since the film revolves around the impending destruction of Earth and is supposed to be serious. However, it wasn't bother by the humor, I thought it fit well. Aside from the cast, the action scenes taking place in space were fun to watch. These scenes includes typical eye-popping explosions that Michael Bay is known for, along with great special effects. While there is all the action, humor, and fun that many would enjoy, there is also some emotional scenes towards the climax at left me choked up. Armageddon does have it's flaws.Aside from the occasionally clumsy acting, there is one scene I found a little obnoxious, which is a scene involving Ben Affleck's character singing a corny little love song to Liv Tyler's character. Overall, this movie is very enjoyable. Don't listen to what critics say, I found this film to be entertaining and fun to sit through.",9,3,7,15 June 2015
The Revenant," The Revenant grabs you and never lets go
","Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu who brought us the Academy Award winning picture 'Birdman' brings us a powerful film inspired by true events that took place in the l820s in snowy mountains of what is now Montana and North Dakota. The Revenant tells the story of Northern frontiersman Hugh Glass (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) and his tribe under the command of Andrew Henry (played by Domhall Gleeson) who escape their village after devastating attack by the Native American tribe leads to severe casualties. On their expedition towards the east, Glass is viciously attacked by a grizzly bear, and is severely wounded. With his party struggling to aid, the ruthless John Fitzgerald (played by Tom Hardy) and Jim Bridger (played by Will Poulter), under Fitzgerald's orders, rob him and leave him for dead, while Fitzgerald merciless murders his son in fear. Buried alive, Glass awakens from his critical state and embarks on a journey cross-country on a search to hunt down the men who betrayed him. Alejando Gonzalez Inarritu has some of the most lively styles of filmmaking in recent years, and it really took audiences everywhere by storm with his previous works. This film, sparkling with stunning cinematography, stellar performances, and a fascinating direction; stands a prime example of a director pushing for pure realism. The film opens with the main character and his tribe as their village is suddenly attacked by the Native American militia, and we watch as a number of people are brutally injured and killed. This entire is bloody and quite intense to watch. Nonetheless, what makes these opening ten minutes compelling is the amazing camera-work by Emmanuel Lubezki. It is done in such a fascinating way to where it pulls us right into the action, and the heat of the bloodshed battle can be felt. The biggest attention-grabber however, may the bear attack sequence which is probably the most intense scene in the entire film. Complete with sound editing, this scene consisting of Leonardo Dicaprio viciously fighting off the bear as brutally claws and bites him, is shot in a way to make it painful and cringe-inducing to watch. But the authenticity of the scene is the real gem. Then the film ventures through the main character's journey across the nation which I think is the biggest weakspot of the story due to its slow pacing.This film stops at nothing to portray pure realism with such solid camera-work, use of natural lighting and the captivating performances by Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy. Dicaprio who's character has a short amount of dialogue throughout the runtime, embraces a strong performance through his facial expressions rather than stellar dialogue. Then Tom Hardy is who plays John Fitzgerald who turns against the main character is very mesmerizing in his role. From the beginning the film, he immediately disappears into his character and gives a performance that shines like gold. The performances are what redeems the film from its slow pacing. There is little doubt that the film struggles to sustain its 156 runtime with the its pacing, and at times, can get a little tedious. Nevertheless, the realism of the action and the story can be enough to grab your attention and hold on to it for its entirety. The Revenant is definitely one of the best films of the year, and demonstrates some of the best performances of this year as well. Leonardo Dicaprio is great what maybe the performance of his career, and just might finally land him his long awaited Oscar. The film is very gripping, very realistic, and something everyone should look into.",9,0,3,10 January 2016
Trouble with the Curve," Here lies a sports drama starring Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams doing their least remarkable roles
","Clint Eastwood has established himself as a major Hollywood icon for the last six decades since the inauguration of his career. Even he falls victim to some less than remarkable roles whether he is working in front or behind the camera. This sports drama starring the aging star, pushing his 80s, in the lead role sees him putting on a good performance in what is nonetheless one of his weakest entries in his career in front of the camera. With his previous on screen role being the grumpy Korean War veteran in 'Gran Torino', Eastwood has struck the screen once again with Oscar nominee Amy Adams on his side, a movie dealing with the politics of major league baseball. It is only too bad the film falls short of emotional impact and drives with a story that is criminally underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, these are two of the Hollywood's most talented actors working on screen. That justifies how reasonable it is to believe they would collaborate on something more rousing. It comes to show the most golden stars are not always the winners. This film follows Gus Lobel (played by Clint Eastwood), an aging, widowed baseball scout struggling with his eye contact, who crosses paths with his estranged daughter Mickey (played by Amy Adams), a lawyer who is on her way being promoted to a higher position. Despite their dysfunctional relationship, she becomes his partner-in-crime on a scouting trip to North Carolina to recruit players for the Atlanta Braves. During the trip, they struggle to come to terms with their past relationship. Director Robert Lorenz does not have the film drowning in a total loss, there is still a small amount of grace to be admired in his execution. The film has its heart in the right place and lightens with a little charm and occasional humor to sugarcoat the mood. But when it comes to evoking interest in its story, that is when it leaves you desiring for something of a higher option. What transpires throughout the picture is a mixed mag of sappy family drama and the anxiety of fighting to make ends meet in the corporate office outside the baseball field; similar to what transpired in 'Moneyball', only this film lacks the dramatic coercion that made that film is hit. When the tackling on the family dynamics between the lead character and his daughter including the questioning of his abandonment during her childhood; the story is heart-filling enough, though it eventually loses its emotional steam. Don't expect anything of a tear-jerker. When shifting its focuses on Mickey with her work dilemmas, it gets plodding and uninteresting, not to mention cheesy. The best thing the film can walk away with is, of course, a strong performance by Clint Eastwood, playing in usual grumpy old man persona. As for Amy Adams, she is fine no less. Her chemistry with Justin Timberlake however, certainly doesn't sizzle in the way it wants to be. Sure, they have their moments, but they're definitely nothing special. John Goodman as one of the baseball managers and Gus's best friend is fine too as is Matthew Lillard as the antagonist drafters of the baseball team. Are they memorable roles though? Not Really. Trouble with The Curve is a fine sports drama with a little bit of charm to experienced, but nonetheless sees Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams acting in arguably their least remarkable roles in recent years. The movie is not necessarily a dud, especially as it will likely attract the attention for those who have fandom for major league baseball. On the other hand, there are better and more admirable options in the roster of baseball movies.",6,0,1,21 September 2017
Bridge of Spies," Enthralling Cold War espionage thriller by Steven Spielberg
","Director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks collaborate once again this espionage thriller set in the 1950s in the height of the Cold War, a period of political tensions between many nations across the globe and a time when the United States facing threats of communism from the Soviet Union that ravaged on until the early 1990s following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Based on the true events, Tom Hanks play James Donovan, an American lawyer who takes on a daunting court case to defend Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance), who is suspected of being a Russian spy, much to the outrage of the public as well as his wife and children. When CIA U-2 Spy-plane pilot Francis Scott Powers (played by Austin Stowell) is shot down and captured by the Soviets, Donovan is assigned into a negotiation with Germany to exchange Abel for Powers who is held hostage by German officers. This film marks Steven Spielberg's first collaboration with the Coen Brothers who produced this film, though the lack of humor typical for the directorial duo make it difficult to tell.This film does a pleasant job with highlighting the key points of the Cold War conflicts. It accurately portrays the atmosphere and the paranoia of nuclear war that America dealt with during this period. After all, it is Steven Spielberg behind the camera, and his director appears to carry polished knowledge on American history as demonstrated in some his previous outlets. One of the Cold War's most crucial elements of paranoia is best demonstrated in a scene for an example where Donovan's young daughter is in school and her class is watching an instructional video on seeking shelter for when a nuclear explosion occurs, and you see clips of cities getting wiped out by nuclear explosions. It genuinely shows the emotions people felt when the United States was in conflict against the Soviet Union, and how the threat of nuclear exchange was dangerously high. The Coen Brothers' screenplay and the direction are very well accomplished here, at least for the majority. Spielberg ambitiously maintains intriguing story as it follows the perilous journey of the main character and his attempt to make a deal with the Soviet Union, a deal that can carry catastrophic consequences if gone wrong. And with a crafty hand like Spielberg, he manages to keep the plot moving at a fairly solid pace, even when the film gets a bit too talky at certain points. Though the story doesn't quite offer many elements of surprise or even emotional depth (especially for a Spielberg flick), Spielberg fuels in plenty of substance to sustain the plot on an intriguing scale. The biggest disappointment in the narrative department however, may lie in the anti- climatic (though nicely shot by Janusz Kaminski) ending as the story concludes in a fading light fashion rather than with a bang, but there are some fair goodies in terms of the acting. Tom Hanks leads a terrific performance as his character James Donovan who is written beautifully without feeling very lionized with heroism. Mark Rylance does a pretty swell job as Rudolf Abel, the antagonist character who is portrayed very humanly without falling victim to contrived villainous characterization. Bridge of Spies is one of the best film of the year and is definitely a must see. While it certainly isn't as memorable as Steven Spielberg's other works, its still very satisfying. This is also probably the best film you will see centered on the Cold War.",8,3,7,19 October 2015
Split," M. Night Shyamalan strikes back for a solidly crafted, spine-chilling experience
","After his major success with the 1999 psychological horror-thriller 'The Sixth Sense', M. Night Shyamalan, an expert of suspense and supernatural twists, appeared to have a promising career ahead of him. Following his triumph with 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs', Shyamalan sorely met a downward trajectory in his career with a long string of cinematic duds that failed to demonstrate the firm potential of his filmmaking talent. After the vast disappointment of 2013's 'After Earth', movie fans everywhere grew pessimistic about his career ever resurfacing. His career finally saw a small shade of heavenly light when he directed the 2015 found-footage thriller 'The Visit' which marked a moderate comeback. This psychological thriller however, shows Shyamalan returning to the supernatural genre in his most valuable form with psychological twists and mind-bending thrills. Echoing his notable works, this film strolls audiences through a dark, mysterious vehicle where expectations are challenged and minds of viewers are effectively played with. This film follows three teenage girls: best friends Claire (played by Haley Ru Richardson) and Marcia (played by Jessica Sula), and social awkward outsider Casey (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) who are abducted and trapped inside a basement cellar by the hands of a psychopath (played by James McAvoy). He isn't no ordinary psychopath however, he is a man who suffers from dissociative identity disorder (meaning he carries 23 different personalities). The girls must outsmart him in attempt to escape before suffering by the hands his 24th and his most vicious personality yet -- The Beast.M. Night Shyamalan is veteran for crafting smart, spine-tingling vehicles that challenge the minds of viewers and spear them with twist endings that that are nearly impossible to see on the horizon. That is until his long string of cinematic debacles began trailing on his career. Here, Shyamalan has made a triumphant return and mingled in a superbly crafted plot with a solid assortment of spellbinding thrills and engaging cinematography that echoes Mike Gioulakis's work in 'It Follows'. The story cuts back and worth between James McAvoy's chilling interaction with the girls, and his relationship with his therapist (played by Betty Buckley) who plays a vital role throughout the story. The former however, easily marks the story's high points. The cutthroat atmosphere is enticingly generated by a chilling performance by James McAvoy who drastically alternates between a long series of multiple personalities with pinches of both dark humor and cynicism, and the battle of the minds between his character and the three teen girls rolls with plenty of startling twists. As part his trademark style, Shyamalan is a director in favor of not repetitive jump scares or drenching the atmosphere in relentless blood and gore, but instead using a thoughtful narrative to toy with the minds of viewers. And his methods greatly pay from the start to the climatic final act when the suspense and thrills goes on full throttle, to an ending that will raise some eyebrows. If this film has any blemishes, it may be the underdevelopment of the female characters portrayed by Haley Ru Richardson and Jessica Sula as opposed to Anya Taylor-Joy's character is the only one of the trio assembled in a three-dimensional state. And there are some occasional instances of dialogue that comes off rather cheesy. Overall, M. Night Shyalaman crafts for a superb experience where these flaws can be effortlessly overlooked.Split is provocative, spine-chilling psychological thrill piece that not only scores for an engrossing experience, but also marks a triumphant return for director M. Night Shyamalan in his career. In a large pile of January-released duds, this film truly stands out among them. Needless to say, it proves that 2015's 'The Visit' wasn't a just a fluke.",8,1,9,30 January 2017
American Psycho," Edgy black comedy is both entertaining and shocking
","Mary Herron energizes Bret Easton Ellis's controversial novel with an intelligent script and powerful direction in this violent, thought-provoking black comedy that will leave audiences shocked to the core. Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a wealthy Wall Street investor living in the luxury apartments of New York City. During the day, Bateman is hard-working employee at the Wall Street industry with a loving fiancée Eveyln Williams (played by Reese Witherspoon), but is secretly in love with another blondie named Jean (played by Chloe Sevigny). When his friends and co-workers do not is that Bateman is hiding a dark and fatal secret when, at night, he lives with a life as a sadistic serial killer; murdering his fellow mates one by one. As his vicious body count steadily rises, he soon becomes increasingly insane and finds himself questioning reality and those around him. Actor Jared Leto makes a fantastic appearance as one of Bateman's close friends, and William Dafoe plays a New York detective who is assigned the case of the murders that rise from Patrick Bateman's hostility. This is not your average serial killer flick. Instead of doing what most slasher-horror films do, centering on victims being slaughtered by one by one by a vicious psychopath, this revolves around the serial killer himself and how it murdering affects him psychologically. However, this film is not a horror film. Instead, it is a dark comedy that uses philosophical elements and some horror elements to create a chilling, thought-provoking story, and a captivating, but harrowing main character. Christian Bale takes on a risky role as the main character Patrick Bateman, a serial killer who sports a similar characteristic of Norman Bates from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. This vicious mentality is demonstrated in the scenes where he invites a friend over to his luxurious apartment, and treats them to classic 80s pops songs by artists like Phil Collins, Huey, Lewis, and Whitney Houston and gives them a smart talk about the before ending their life in a gruesome manner. In other scenes, and his dialogue in these scenes help portray the character's cruel sense of humor. Christian Bale is just fearless in this role, and his performance is stunning, probably one of the best performances he has given in his career. My only flaw with the film is the twist ending which is supposed to shock audiences, but only ends being more confusing than it needs to be.American Psycho is a pretty captivating film, and a worthy adaption of Bret Easton Ellis's novel. It is very spine-chilling, very funny, and quite thought-provoking. I only recommend this movie to viewers 17 and over due to the graphic violence and sexuality that is present throughout.",9,0,0,15 December 2015
Knowing," Alex Proyas's doomsday piece boasts a chock full of interesting concepts and sleek special effects to make up its fundamentally flawed climax
","This science-fiction thrill piece starring Nicolas Cage in the protagonist role is a film blooming with brainy concepts on science and religion, while hanging over apocalyptic themes that pay reminiscence of other end-of-the-world flicks like 'Left Behind'. After all, the key figure in the story is revolves around what appears be a biblical prophecy, although the spiritial theme only serves as a small undertone here rather than driving the storyline. Director Alex Proyas, the father of projects such as 'Dark City' and 'I, Robot', exhibits his grandeur of visual stimulating style that manages to triumph over its compelling, if somewhat flawed plot. Proyas is successful at making the thought-provoking ideas work, even if they are occasionally little rocky. The only major flaw is lies in the final act that borders on the line of preposterous. It is not a groundbreaking piece of work for the genre, but it is just enough to warrant for a sweet recommendation. This film opens up in 1959, at an elementary school where children are given the assignment to draw pictures of what society will like fifty years from that time. One girl, Lucinda Embrey (played by Lara Robinson), draws a long series of seemingly random numbers and places the paper in the school's time capsule. Flash forward to fifty years later, a nine-year old Caleb Koestler (played by Chandler Canterbury) and his class open up the time capsule, and Lucinda's paper is found in his hands. When he shows the paper to his widowed father John (played by Nicolas Cage), an astrophysics professor at Massachutes Institute of Technology, John believes the numbers are enigmatic codes to disasters occurring around the globe. Enlisting the help of Lucinda's daughter Diana (played by Rose Byrne) and granddaughter Abby (also played by Lara Robinson), John must encrypt the message of what seems to be a sign of a global catastrophic event. Some may question whether Alex Proyas is trying to deliver a cautionary tale about an apocalyptic prophecy or is pinning viewers with complex ideas of science and religious theology. Both are more than likely doubtful, especially when the plot shows little respect for the laws of science to begin with. Nonetheless, it keeps things deeply eerie and grim in terms of storytelling and tone, almost bordering the line of a psychological horror thriller. Caleb and Abby are children who are haunted by mysterious entities, resembling the alien creatures from 'Dark City', who introduce them to terrifying visions of the world facing mass destruction, an eerie, yet shocking concept that is placed with sweet visual spark in one scene where the former looks out his window and sees the forest engulfed in flames. The main protagonist in the story however, is John Koestler who is infused with a performance by Nicolas Cage that can only be described as acceptable, but not bad. When Koestler learns of the terrifying secrets behind Lucinda's prophetic message, that is when the story kicks into gear, allowing Proyas to experiment with his engaging concepts. His attempts at breathing life into his ideas are mostly successful and set room for some visually electrifying sequences such as devastating plane crash that leaves several victims flailing in flames and a subway crash that racks up an enormous death toll. However, the third act, which is predictable and sets up with heavy emotional sigma, is a little absurd; especially if how unrealistic the characters behave to such an unnerving situation that is on the horizon. Shouldn't they be more terrified? On the bright side, the audience is blessed with a riveting score by Marco Beltrami to settle the tone.Knowing is a compelling doomsday-themed piece with a chock of interesting ideas of science and religion put into play, and a surprisingly enthralling execution by Alex Proyas who brings his powerful visual grandeur to the game. It is a flawed picture with an execution may have a few scars, but not enough to make it a sore to sit through. Don't expect it to be anything revolutionary.",7,4,5,27 July 2017
Hugo," Hugo is a smart, elegant adventure that marks a surprising new turn for Martin Scorcese
","Would you have guess influential filmmaker Martin Scorcese would step foot behind the camera of a children's movie, let alone on with the magic and energy that feels reminiscent to classic works of Steven Spielberg or Robert Zemeckis. This rollicking period piece set in Paris during the 1930s marks a surprising new turn for Martin Scorcese who is rarely known for stepping outside the gritty mobster genre, with 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' being some of his most notable work. If you thought that Scorcese effectively achieving the innocence of childhood and the liveliness of Brian Selznick's book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' would a task too good to be true, prepared to get blown away because Scorcese has proved himself capable of casting his hands on a genre that actually kid-friendly unlike most of his more somber works. Set in the 1930s, the film follows 12-year old Hugo Cabret (played by Asa Butterfield), a young boy living at a busy train station in Paris after the death of his father (played by Jude Law), where he works as a maintenance boy fixing the clock tower when he need be. The boy owns a robotic figure known as the automaton which was left be his father after his death. One day, he comes face-to-face with a girl named Isabelle (played by Chloe Grace Moretz), the granddaughter of a toy store owner and former filmmaker Georges Melies (played by Ben Kingsley). Hugo learns that Isabelle along with her grandfather hold a secret to his late father that the two children must set out to discover.Although the film is marketed towards children, the sophistication of the plot can be a little difficult for elementary school-aged youngsters to buy into. Fortunately, that is not to say that Martin Scorcese doesn't bring a certain elegance to the story that would appeal to both children and adults alike, particularly if they watch this in 3-D. From the breathtaking opening bird's eye shot of Paris, to the inspiring visuals, the film has more than a handful to bargain for. The film tells a blissful story that captures the astounding innocence of childhood and an adventure of a young boy to discover the true meaning of home, while learning some astonishing secrets of his late father. Scorcese successfully captures this without diving too far in the dark territory nor coming off too juvenile, though the tone in which story proceeds lean slightly more on the former side. The story is certainly not an excellent as it kicks off on a rather meandering start during it's first half, but when it finally takes off its quite mesmerizing. As the plot proceeds, the film gracefully dives into the two young leads discovering the history of film ranging from the story behind the 1902 silent film 'A Trip to the Moon', to the dawn of the use of 3-D in cinema, to an inspiring secret that leads to a revelation of the one of the supporting characters. It's a subplot that serves not only as a tasty treat for the story, but also a love letter to Hollywood buffs particularly by Martin Scorcese who doesn't hesitate to express his love for the realm of cinema.What comes from a sensational story based on the screenplay by John Logan (who last collaborated with Martin Scorcese in 'The Aviator') along with Brian Selznick's novel must come some engaging characters and performances. That is where English actor Asa Butterfield and actress Chloe Grace Moretz come in. Asa Butterfield effectively breaths life into the titular character, he brings a certain innocence to his character that many child actors his age struggle to deliver nowadays. Along his side is Chloe Grace Moretz who stands as one of the finest teen actresses working today. Differentiating from her high-octane foulmouthed persona as Hit Girl in the superhero actioner 'Kick Ass' and her vicious vampire portrayal in 'Let Me In', Moretz brings a fair amount of ingenuity in her character who becomes a loyal friend to the titular character on his mission, especially with her rich British accent she manages pull off. Academy Award winner Ben Kingsley delivers a sense of freshness in the role of Georges Melies, the grandfather of Chloe Grace Moretz's character. Lastly is Sacha Baron Cohen who provides some fair comic relief as the quirky train station operator who along with his not-so friendly dog makes several unsuccessful but light-hearted attempts to capture the young child and send him off to an orphanage, but to face a series of goofy pratfalls from the child outwitting him.Hugo is a smart, if not masterful family-friendly adventure that marks a shocking new turn for influential director Martin Scorcese. It is an elegant adventure that will likely meet great appeal to middle school-age kids if not elementary schoolers. Nonetheless, it is a lively treat that sees Martin Scorcese expanding upon his cinematic range.",8,2,3,3 December 2016
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Inferior continuation to the Terminator saga lacks excitement
","In this second sequel set ten years after the events of Terminator 2: Judgement Day when John Connor and his mother Sarah Connor seemingly stopped the occurrence of the war between war between mankind and Skynet, John Connor (played by Nick Stahl) is 19 years old and is living as the drifter with no place to live, paranoid about being found by another terminator. However, Skynet sends T-X (played by Kristanna Loken), a powerful and sinister android who's bent on killing Connor. Aided by his future wife Kate Brewster (played by Claire Danes) and CSM-101 (played by Arnold Schwartznegger), another terminator resembling T-800, John Connor must find Kate Brewster's father General Robert Brewster (played by David Andrews) who is capable of shutting down Skynet as it spreads a deadly virus across the globe that would lead to nuclear war and ignite the war between humans and the machines. Racing against the clock, will John Connor succeed and save the future of mankind, or does mankind have a dark future ahead of them?The first two films were quite impressive, the first film dealt with the Terminator traveling back in time to assassinate Sarah Connor and her then-unborn son John Connor to prevent the war, and the second film followed the next terminator traveling back in time to protect John Connor from being killed by T-1000 as he was supposed to be the future resistance leader in the war against the machines. This film, directed by Jonathan Mostow, continues the story of the franchise, while this demonstrating some pulse-pounding action sequences and a compelling premise, it sadly falls short of the excitement that made the first two films entertaining. This movie continues the story on a rather middling note. From the first ten minutes, we are introduced to the evil robot T-X driving around town and executing these targeted civilians who serve no relevance to the plot. Then we are introduced to CSM-101 who arrives at a strip bar to steal the clothes and car keys of a bouncer, similar to what we saw in Terminator 2 with T-800. There is also the intense, but exciting special effects-heavy car chase scene with CSM-101, similar to the motorcycle chase with John Connor and T-1000. These two scenes, while full of excitement, play a great homage to the events of the last films to where it almost feels it is repeating the same events from the previous movie. From there on, the plot becomes less and less interesting, the action becomes less compelling, and the characters seem a bit tiresome. The main thing the characters are lacking is good dialogue and writing. Thus, they end up becoming less memorable. While the actions manages to keep the film standing, this film itself suffers in many places, especially the ending which I found rather anticlimactic, even though it sets the tone for the next film.Terminator 3: Rise of The Machines did not live up to my expectations and fell inferior to the last two films, especially the second one which I consider the best of the franchise. I believe this could have been better if it was handled by James Cameron who was responsible of the last two movies.",5,3,7,26 November 2015
Wanted," Wanted is a hyperkinetic, visually stunning thrill ride from beginning to end
","While DC and Marvel Comics have the most share in the spotlight for comic-book-to-Hollywood adaptations, it is not uncommon for the lesser known literary material to meet success with endearing cinematic endeavors to the big screen. That is where this gun- blazing action thriller comes to play. Based on the graphic novel by Mark Millar, this action thriller directed by Russian filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov mixes hyper bullet time action with 'Sin City'-style violence to create a stylized Matrix- like bullet-time. From the striking visual flair, to the frenetic gun-blazing action, this film treats moviegoers to a bombastic hard-R adventure that while doesn't engage with a powerful plot nor to fuel the brain with its mythical law of physics with its action, provides just enough pulse-pounding thrills to keep action junkies glued to their seats. From the opening scene to the end, it is clear that the director draws his influence from the 'The Matrix', and he manages to put his semi-distinct vision into a good use. The results are something fresh for the action-thirsty filmgoers to chow down on. This film stars James McAvoy as Wesley, a frustrated and disillusioned Chicago white-collar worker tormented by his boss and living with his unfaithful girlfriend (played by Kristen Hager) who is secretly cheating on him with his best friend Barry (played by Chris Pratt). When he is caught up in an outrageous shootout with a hot-shot assassin Fox (played by Angelina Julie), he learns he is the son of a professional assassin. Fox introduces him to a secret society known as 'The Fraternity' lead by the charismatic Sloan (played by Morgan Freeman). With the help, Wesley must master their powerful abilities to prepare against the fraternity's most powerful enemy.The film pedals with a plot that is compelling enough, but perhaps nothing special or surprising on an eyebrow-raising level. But that is not the main appeal here as the film's major attraction to the park is the hyper-kinetic action. Director Timur Bekmambetov brings Mark Millar's graphic novel to life with some of the most electrifying action sequences ever put to screen, but certainly not in the way will engage the brain cells. That is because the main attraction in this visually stimulating action is the characters' abilities to curve gun bullets upon firing. Combining elements of bullet-time action that owes homages to the 'The Matrix' and stunning CGI, Bekmambetov brings a hefty hand to setting the action in a powerfully fresh showcase, but does so that like in the source material, rebels against the laws of physics. With bullets flying in a slow motion, curving paths, and at far more than enough times, colliding together in mid-air; this film superbly lands a fair amount of visual compulsion and heart-stopping action to fuel the adrenaline, while pushing the boundaries of physical absurdity. There is also a few car chase sequences added to the mix. While the action is nothing short of fun and excitement, it should not serve as a science lesson to how gun bullets as it is physically impossible to manually curve a gun bullet, and exceptionally rare for opposing bullet to meet in a mid-air collision. Nonetheless, it is clear that Bekmambetov has a clue of what he is doing. The plot moves a fairly decent pace, and the character stand just enough depth of them to make them compelling to watch. James McAvoy delivers a fine performance in the role of Wesley, a zero-to-hero man who discovers hidden ability he never knew he engraved. Although he brings nothing particularly powerful to the table, the actor firmly fits the bill. Easily the most appealing role is Angelina Julie's character Fox, who Julie blesses plentiful amount of grit and eye-appeal to. She firmly establishes herself as a strong, compelling badass chick. Morgan Freeman, the charismatic actor he is, storms the screen with a sound performance as the fraternity leader Sloane, nothing more, nothing less.Wanted is a compelling ride thrill ride and certainly fits the slot as must-watch for most, if not all action fans everywhere. Although this film never blows any entries of the genre out of the water including in terms of graphic-novel adaptations, it nonetheless makes for an appealing pick for everyone hungry for some hyper- kinetic action.",9,2,4,26 January 2016
Warrior," Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton are the revelations of this superbly riveting exploration of family dynamics and mixed martial arts
","This mixed martial arts drama is not your average everyday drama following an underdog rising from your average fighter to the holder of the championship title, it is a superbly riveting exploration of family and a brotherly bond that is tested to the limits. In other words, it is a film that does not try to level up with classics like 'Rocky', but simply being something with a heart and soul blossoming through the electrifying nature of its story. Plus, one of the few things differentiating from the Sylvestor Stallone classic is the sport in focus of his drama is mixed martial arts fighting instead of boxing. But the emotional core of the story lies not within the action inside the ring but what happens outside that defines the action following the bell ring. Even if there are a few moments that feel burnt up emotional manipulation, there is hardly a minute in its slightly overlong runtime that feels squandered. The movie is orchestrated by director Gavin O'Connor who has a solid cast by his side, ranging from Joel Edgerton, to Tom Hardy, to Oscar nominee Nick Nolte. This film follows Tommy Conlon (played by Tom Hardy), a disconcerted Iraq war veteran who returns to his hometown in Pittsburgh to meet his father (played by Nick Nolte) who is a recovering alcoholic after the abuse and neglect he laid on his family years ago. With his goal on entering a MMA tournament to the win $50,000 championship prize, Tommy asked his father to be his trainer. Meanwhile, his estranged brother Brendan (played by Joel Edgerton), a former MMA fighter, has retired and is now a high school physics teacher who's family is in danger on losing their house in foreclosure. After a night of MMA fighting gets him suspended on his job, Brendan goes against his wife's (played by Jennifer Morrison) wishes and enters the tournament with his old friend Frank (played by Frank Grillo) as his coach. When this puts him on a collision course with Tommy, the two estranged brothers must come to terms with their dark pasts perpetrated by their father. The film more often not relies on typical clichés known the sports genre. Whereas as this serves as a detriment to most movies, this one goes for a more powerful approach and expands upon these clichés to present the fortitude of the story. The story is not all about MMA fighting or exercising male masculinity, it examines the harrowing family dynamics of the two central characters as they struggle to cope with their past that comes back to haunt them. Their old man was a drunk and abused them, and as a result, put a strain in the family altogether. When the two men finally come back to meet him as well as each other, their bond is greatly tested. This open doors to an exhilarating, yet emotionally raw climax when the two are forced to compete against each other in the ring. The MMA fighting sequences are superbly executed, shot with hand-held cinematography and staged such a powerful grit to the point where the heat and intensity of the fights are palpable. You may find yourself holding your breath. Nonetheless, it is the cold family drama that plays the golden role in the plot. And the performances by the cast which consists of mainly A-listers are the keys to lifting the atmosphere up high. Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton, both maintaining buff, muscular figures, are powerful revelations here and play their roles with an astonishing amount of emotional stride. Whether they are going head-to-head inside the rings or interacting with their family, these two do nothing to let a moment go to waste. Nick Nolte is also no exception, playing a man butchered by his past decisions and crying with a heart to do everything he can to keep his family together. But the question is, will the two brothers find it in their heart to forgive him? Warrior is an electrifying family drama built on both the gripping performances by its two main stars and Gavin O'Connor's powerful exploration into the family dynamics and brotherhood. It is a film that will touch your heart and win it over. Whether or not one holds interest in mixed martial arts fighting is no matter, it is a gripping experience that will stay with you long after the credits are rolling.",9,1,1,7 August 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the greatest and most visually stunning sci-fi actions films of all time
","How often do you see a sequel that surpasses it's predecessor? Sequels like these are exceptionally rare and come only once in a blue moon. In the summer of 1991, Director James Cameron left a long lasting impression on audience with this exciting and visually stunning sequel to the 1984 science-fiction classic 'Terminator', with Arnold Schwarzenegger in arguably his most iconic role. Exploding with groundbreaking computer-generated visuals and energy-fueled special effects, this sequel to the 1984 predecessor continuing the storyline with a plot more fleshed out than ever and more compelling character exploration than what James Cameron brought us in the first outing. And the results are nothing short of impressive or fun. From the opening scene showing the massive shoot out between the terminators followed by the burning landscape in the opening credits, to the ending; this movie James Cameron delivering his outstanding flair of filmmaking to the screen. Terminator 2: Judgement Day sees Schwartznegger return as T-800, a robot sent back in time to the year 1995 to protect John Conner (played by Edward Furlong) the preteen son of Sarah Conner (played by Linda Hamilton -- who he tried to kill in the first film) who is now imprisoned in a mental facility, from a liquid metal shape-shifting robot named T-1000 (played by Robert Patrick), who sets out to kill the young lad.This science-fiction adventure offers just about everything you would expect from a sequel except one thing, only much better. It kicks off with an engaging premise about a war between humans and robots ruled by Skynet (the main antagonist), a lethal computer network system that launches a massive global attack that wipes out millions of lives on Earth. The war is the event known as Judgement Day. From there on out, the film blesses us with an powerful plot that carries on quite well from beginning to end, and characters with magnetic backgrounds. This includes John Connor who is revealed to be a future resistance leader during the aftermath of Judgement Day, that is if they fail to stop it. Arnold Schwartznegger does a magnificent job as T-800, probably the most memorable performance of his career. Yes, his performance does lack emotion but what do you expect? He's playing a robot. And let's not forget his larger-than-life line 'Hasta La Vista, baby!'. Edward Furlong does a pretty well job as John Conner, especially for this being his first acting role. Then there is Linda Hamilton playing Sarah Conner, John's mother, who is assist John and T-800 on their mission to bring down the tyrant T-1000, played by Robert Patrick who fits suitably well in the role. Hamilton is tremendous in her role, indulging a fair amount of charisma and emotion into her character with a mysterious past. While the film grants an astonishing amount of nuance in the narrative department, the most impressive aspect comes from the visual effects. Arguably the biggest eye-catcher in the visuals point out at the way T-1000 transforms back and forth from a human into the liquid metal robot he is. These effects, along with the explosive special effects make up for some high-octane action sequences. Terminator 2: Judgement Day is not only one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made or one of the greatest sequels, but perhaps one of the best films of all time, especially for its decade. This is one of those films many sci-fi fans will love and cherish for many years beyond, no matter how much it ages, an astounding achievement that shows that James Cameron really had something thoughtful in mind.",10,3,5,25 June 2015
Salt," It is an explosive, briskly-paced spy action foray scorching with an appealing image of Angelina Jolie
","When Angelina Jolie makes her appearance on screen, chances are most people are interested in seeing in nothing but her kicking some major ass. And for those who relished in a good time of shoving popcorn in their mouth while watching her go gun-blazing in the action thriller 'Wanted' back in 2008, this one makes a sound, if slightly lesser option. This spy action thriller, helmed from director Phillip Noyce who brought his work to the screen with two Jack Ryan adaptations 'Patriot Games' and 'Clear and Present Danger', is just another one of your average trips to the land of Angelina Jolie wielding her action skills against the baddies as she fights her way through the sporadic blemishes in the script written by Kurt Wimmer. Unlike 'Wanted', this flick proceeds with a slightly more political agenda at hand, primarily the corruption uprooted from Russia since the beginning of their fallout with the United States during the Cold War. This film focuses on Evelyn Salt (played by Angelina Jolie), a CIA operative who is a living a peaceful life with her German boyfriend Michael Krause (played by August Diehl) and being held as one of the most respectable agents at her job. Her life comes crashing down when she is accused by a captured Russian agent Orlov (played by Daniel Olbrychski) of being a Russian sleeper agent with a plan to assassinate the President of the United States. With the law enforcement along with Agent Peabody (played by Chiwetel Eijiofor) pursuing her and her boss Ted Winter (played by Liev Schieber) the only one who fully trusts her, Salt must set out on a mission to clear her name. For a movie set on exhibiting Jolie in her frenetic ass-kicking mode, this one delivers for the most part. Watching the actress step into action with a frenetic gun-blazing, bone-crunching convulsion makes the tasty icing on the cake most action junkies crave for. But those who make the decision of taking the ride seriously fall victim to witnessing the flaws in the film's attempt at establishing a solid political complex. Adding substance to the plot is a political theme involving international corruption and relations between the U.S and Russia which ties knowledge the historical threats of the Soviet Union during the Cold War back in the 50s. It also makes the unfortunate feat of occasionally convoluting the plot, especially when throwing in a few twists and turns that will take audiences by surprise or leave them scratching their heads. Regardless, anyone willing to escape these blemishes are in for a nice treat, and that witnessing Angelina Jolie shoot, punch, and kick were way through the story in a sleek James Bond-style. Tension is kept high and the action falls nothing short of beauty, especially when adding explosions, car crashes, and vehicles slipping to the equation. For what the movie offers, it does enough to meet the appetite of cinema-goers hungry for a blend of sleek action thrills with brainy political subtext to go in the mix. Salt is an entertaining ride, if somewhat forgettable in terms of cinematic action mayhem. For those craving a sweet kick of action, this makes a fresh choice, though it nothing that reaches the peak of its genre. All that can be said is that fun and thrills is the best thing this movie delivers if nothing more.",7,7,8,17 November 2017
We're the Millers," Plenty of fun and laughter with the Millers
","Jason Sudeikas and Jennifer Aniston have both proved to possess ingenious comedic caliber over the years, with Sudeikas giving off a hilarious vibe in 'Horrible Bosses' co- starring with Jason Bateman and Charlie Day, and the latter in the ever-popular sitcom 'Friends'. It is little surprise these two stars make a successful comedic duo in this road comedy directed by Rawson Marshall Thurbar, the man behind the hilarious 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story'. Jason Sudeikas plays David Clark, a long-time pot dealer making a living salary off of selling marijuana. This is until one day he tasked by his boss Brad Gurdlinger (played by Ed Helms) with a highly dangerous assignment: pick up a large load of pot from Mexico and smuggle it into the U.S. Fearing the suspicion of authority officials of traveling alone with a mass amount of pot, David assembles a fake family consisting of his neighbor and local stripper Rose O'Reilly (played by Jennifer Aniston) as his wife, teenage social outcast Casey (played by Emma Roberts) and geeky teenage boy Kenny (played by Will Poulter) as his children in pretend of a family vacationing for the Fourth of July. As you might have guess, things don't go quite as they may expected and result in them running into some trouble, along with an unexpected acquaintance of the Fitzgeralds, a family of threeIn today's realm of stoner comedies, characters often take advantage of a mass variety of drug-related dialogue and humor, and off-the-wall situations of characters on pot usage. This movie in the other hand, takes a slightly different route. With plenty of gut-busting humor thrown around and about by the cast and surprisingly original jokes that don't come too often, viewers are in for an entertaining ride down the comedic lane. Enter the two leads Jason Sudeikas and Jennifer Aniston and we are already introduced with a solid comedic duo, thought not on the lines with others like Jonah Hill and Michael Cera in 'Superbad' or Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly in 'Step Brothers'. Then there is Emma Roberts and Will Poulter as the teenager characters. These actors come together to form a strong, hilarious comedic chemistry, and there are many scenes to prove it. One scene in particular involves a Mexican police officer, plenty of laughs are offered here. As the film nears a two-hour runtime, the characters do take a rather long time on their drug smuggling mission and so get involved in some overly recycled road comedy clichés, so the fun and laughter does fall short in a few areas, including a scene featuring Jennifer Aniston performing a strip dance. Fortunately, the film manages to make it work for most of the time and there is rarely a dull moment lying around here. We're The Millers is a hilarious comedy that leaves good notes on the careers of Jason Sudeikas and Jennifer Aniston as well as director Rawson Marshall Thurbar. This film is a must-watch for those seeking time of laughter and fun. Yes, there are some especially crude moments, one in particularly involves frontal nudity so take caution. Otherwise, this comedic picture is worth your attention.",9,0,4,5 June 2016
The Patriot," Ingenious American Revolutionary War spectacle
","Directed by Roland Emmerich, this ambitious war drama set in 1776 in South Carolina during the American Revolution stars Mel Gibson as Benjamen Martin, a widowed French- Indian war veteran haunted by his past experiences in the the war and roots to live a peaceful life with his children: the youngest Susan (Skye McCole Bartiask), Samuel (Bryan Chafin), William (Logan Lerman), Margaret (Mika Boorem), Nathan (Trevor Morgan), Thomas (Gregory Smith), and the eldest Gabriel (Heath Ledger), wanting to take part in the war against the British military. However, his oldest son Gabriel goes against his father's wishes and joins the continental army himself. When the British army led by the sadistic Colonel William Tavingtom (Jason Isaacs), launches an attack on Martin's family and murders one of his children in cold blood, Benjamen finds himself pulled into the war to protect his family and exact revenge on the British army.This is second war film with Mel Gibson who starred in the critically acclaimed 1995 hit Braveheart. There is no doubt that to say that director Roland Emmerich does an spectacular job with his movie. The performances by Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger are nothing short of fantastic, and the script does an magnificent job on portraying the grim atmosphere of the revolutionary war. Most of the characters are beautifully written and quite likable, especially Heath Ledger's character. Jason Isaacs makes an impressive (and scary) on the main antagonist Colonel William Tavington, who leads the British Red Coats against the continental army. When we first introduced his character, he is extremely unlikeable with his cruel and sadistic demeanor against Mel Gibson and his family, committing some of the most horrific acts against the American civilians including shooting them at point blank range, burning down their houses, burning down churches, etc. The only thing that may upset viewers is the depiction of the British Red Coats. This is best demonstrated in the scenes when a Catholic family is locked in a church which then burned down by Colonel Tavington and his army, and the scene when Benjamin and his family's houses are set in flames. While these scenes are powerful and put the story in motion, they are sadly over dramatized. The film tries to inaccurately portray the British army as German Nazis from World War II. However, unless you are big history buff, it may there is a good chance you will let this slide. I wasn't particularly bothered by this.The Patriot is one of Mel Gibson's best films behind Braveheart and We Were Soldiers, the acting was great, the story and atmosphere is very well done, and the battle scenes are portrayed quite realistically. Now as this is a war film, it does get a bit intense at times and very emotional, though not on the line of films like Saving Private Ryan. Nonetheless, this film is a must-watch for all.",9,0,5,24 October 2015
Silver Linings Playbook," Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are the true revelations of this grounded testament on love and complex relationships
","Silver Linings Playbook is a magnificent testament on family and complicated relationships uprooted unpleasant circumstances. It is charming story of love between two people find each other's in odd and and unexpected points in their lives. Who is a better director than David O. Russell to tackle on his ingenious tale? That's right, the famed director of the comedy 'Three Kings' and the dramas 'I Heart Huckabees' and 'The Fighter', operates with soaring humanity on bringing together this heart-stirring tale based on the Matthew Quick's 2008 novel of the same name. It is not your average romantic tale that Hollywood has helmed thousands of times to the point where two strangers fall in love and everything from there contributes to a formulaic trajectory before leading to a 'happily ever after' conclusion. Here, things are a little more complicated than that, and that is where actor Bradley Cooper and actress Jennifer Lawrence come into to play, striking at the heart with performances that are too difficult to ignore. Bradley Cooper plays Pat Solitano, a man suffering from bipolar disorder and has somewhat frequent mood swings. His life takes a turn for the worse when he comes home to find his wife Nikki cheating on him with another man. After delivering the man a vicious beating, Nikki kicks out Pat of the house and files for divorce. After spending a few months in a psychiatric hospital, Pat moves in with his parents (played by Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver). In the meantime, he tries to rekindle his relationship with his now ex-wife, but this proves to be impossible since she's put him under a restraining order. One night, he is invited to a dinner where he meets a troubled young woman named Tiffany (played by Jennifer Lawrence) who's husband is dead and is living with her parents and sister Veronica (played by Julia Stiles). Pat and Tiffany began bonding and form a relationship, while learning that they both share the similar problems.In a world where romantic dramas are often lie on the groundwork of run-of-the-mill formula, David O. Russell doesn't believe in pounding filmgoers on the head with overblown sentimentality or expectations. Instead, he offers more of an emotional build-up of a complex relationship rather than just going for the skill with sizzling the story of an endless cycle of hugs, kisses, and melodramatic disputes. What he does is challenge the viewers with a story between two characters that starts out as simple bond with no hints of love interest peeking in sight. In fact, as the story progresses, it digs the deep into the emotional problems two characters face in their lives that make seem almost impossible that a congruent relationship will likely brew. Bradley Cooper's Pat is emotionally disturbed by his past marriage that ended in an unhealthy note, while Jennifer Lawrence's Tiffany is a tragic character who feels lost in a world where everyone fails to make sense of her dilemmas. The truth is neither of them are more messed up than the other. As the two grow closer and closer, that is when the emotional resonance hits. And the chemistry between the two would not work as sufficiently without the genuine performances by Cooper and Lawrence, both of whom ground their roles with strong gravitas. Although their inflated age gap may their relationship a little difficult to buy into, these two Hollywood veterans know how to make things work, as does Robert De Niro who delivers a smear of charm as Bradley Cooper's father. Let's also not forget an unexpected appearance by Chris Tucker who been's off the map in several years following his departure from the 'Rush Hour' franchise, but it makes a sweet effort to return for a minor role as a dance teacher late in the film.Silver Linings Playbook is a magnificent cinematic effort that shows Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence embraces their talent with amazing fortitude, and David O. Russell maturely tackling on a story that never feels hammy or contrived in any way. It is a film that taps at the heart while never shifting the light away from the admirable talent on and offscreen, and it all deserves your attention.",8,0,1,17 November 2015
Divergent," Not as good as The Hunger Games, but very compelling
","In this dystopian thriller, based on the novel series by Veronica Roth, Shailene Woodley plays Tris, a 16-year old girl living in a futuristic city divided by factions based on virtues. These factions include Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless, and Erudite. Everyone (when they reach the age of 16) is assigned to take a psychological test that determines what faction they should join, and in the end, they are allowed to choose the faction of their choice. Tris takes the test and gets the rarest result--Divergent, which means she would not fit any particular faction. When she chooses Dauntless, she and the faction leader Four (played by Theo James) discover the plot to assassinate all who are Divergent as they seen as a threat to social order; and decide they must fight back.To be clear, I never actually read the novel. Upon watching this, however, I found it very similar to the Hunger Games series. They both take place in a dystopian society that is divided up into factions (or districts), except there is no teenagers fighting to the death in a large arena in this one. While this wasn't as exciting and enthralling as the Hunger Games, it was very compelling and interesting to watch. The characters were great, I love how Shailene Woodley played Tris. It was a very interesting role her, especially since her role in the ABC family series 'Secret Life of An American Teenager'. Theo James was.........I guess okay as Four. I don't know if he was the best, but he didn't do too bad. The plot was pretty good, although it did drag a little bit in some spots. There were several scene where I started to lose interest, but when it reached it's climax, it got exciting. I enjoyed the climax towards the end, especially with Kate Winslet playing Jeanine, who is behind the whole to plot to take out the Divergents.Divergent is a pretty decent movie, although it might have been better if I read the novel series before hand. Yes, the film has its flaws but its intriguing to watch and if you a big fan of the novel series, you'll just might enjoy it.",7,0,0,23 July 2015
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Crude and funny
","I enjoy comedy movies by Judd Apatow and this movie is no exception. This hilarious sex comedy starring Steve Carrell as a 40 year old man who, as the title states, has never before had sex is had me laughing like crazy in many scenes. The film's use of sexual jokes was quite clever and the casting was just perfect. Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, and Romany Malco were insanely funny.One of my funniest scenes of the movie was the hair waxing scene where Steve Carrell's character succumbs a painful hair waxing procedure which had me laughing so hard it hurt. The second scene I loved was the 'you know how I know you're gay' scene between Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd. I just think about comebacks they used in that scene and immediately start laughing. (8/10)This is one comedy everyone needs to see!",8,1,2,10 August 2014
Face_Off," Inventive action-packed John Woo thrill ride
","Hong Kong action film Director John Woo brings stellar action and thrills in this action-packed popcorn flick, starring John Travolta and Nicolas Cage who compete in one of the most exhilarating and inventive games of Cat-and-Mouse ever brought together on film. John Travolta plays Sean Archer, a FBI agent and devoted father and husband who is devastated by the cold murder of his son Michael by a ruthless terrorist Castor Troy (played by Nicolas Cage). Six years pass, Troy is still alive and hatches a diabolical plan to use a powerful bomb to blow a city. After seemingly killing Troy in a violent shootout, Archer is assigned on a mission to acquire the information from on the bomb's location from Troy's evil goons, and this plan involves Archer undergoing a medical surgery that removes his facial identity and replaces it with Troy's. While Archer is sent on the island where Troy's henchman are incarcerated, Troy wakes up and undergoes the same surgery to steal Archer's facial identity. It is up Archer is escape the prison and go after Troy who begins using his identity.John Woo packs a punch with some intense, stylized action sequences and elegant action set pieces, along with an abnormal plot that work surprisingly well. This movie follows a stylish story of two men who are literally put into each other's shoes and begin experiencing each other's life and appearance, and John Woo does some amazing experimenting with this concept; switching back and forth from John Travolta's character posing as Nicolas Cage's character to outwit his goons with some intense gunfights and interrogations, to Nicolas Cage's character posing as John Travolta to commit a flirtatious life with his wife and teenage daughter and sabotage his job at the FBI. When Travolta and Cage eventually come face-to-face for the first time as each other, the pulse-pounding gun shootouts ensue and build up into a stunning climax at the end set with some good visuals, and its all fun to watch. The performances are solid and the plot moves at a reasonable pace, and with consistency. Face/Off sets a great example of how action movies should be and it takes a position as the one of the most entertaining action flicks of its decade. Actions fans will be pleased by this film as well as those looking for a great action flick.",8,1,3,23 November 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation is a blast!
","Director Christopher McQuarrie continues with the critically acclaimed spy action franchise with Tom Cruise reprises his role as the IMF agent Ethan Hunt, with bigger action, higher stakes, and more fun. With the new director taking the chair every entry, this film series has allowed viewers to experience a new direction in each outing and a constant change of style, for better or worse; but never without the sheer charisma of Tom Cruise in the lead role. In this fifth installment set after the events of 'Ghost Protocol' when the IMF is shut down by the Senate committee by the request of CIA agent Hunley (played by Alec Baldwin) for the collateral damage resulted from their previous missions, while battling William Brandt (played by Jeremy Renner) in court over the unwanted decision. With the only help of agent Benji Dunn (played by Simon Pegg) and a mysterious femme fatale Ilsa Faust (played by Rebecca Ferguson) who appears to be hiding a dark secret, Hunt must go rouge on a globe-trotting adventure to track down Soloman Lane (played by Sean Harris), the leader of a deadly criminal organization known as the 'Syndicate' responsible for an alarming epidemic of terrorist attacks all across the globe.Similarly to the previous films in the franchise, this film prizes audiences with spectacular action sequences, and eye-popping stunts performed by Tom Cruise himself who much like Jackie Chan, seems to smell fear when it comes to engaging in death-defying stunts. In the previous movie 'Ghost Protocol', Cruise shocked audiences everywhere as they watched him performone of the most jaw-dropping stunts which involved him climbing 2000 ft high on the side of the Burj Khalifa -- the world's tallest building In this movie, Cruise continues his dare-devil persona by takes things up a notch. This all begins in the opening scene when Cruise performs a wild stunt where he is suspended a few thousand feet above the ground while hanging on the side of the airplane with no support but a harness to hold him, and the background shown in the shot ascending from the ground uses no CGI. With the exception of a few securing straps, what viewer's eyes are capturing in this moment is what is really happening, and shows how Tom Cruise is capable of doing his own stunts no matter how increasingly dangerous it can get. Shockingly enough, the opening scene however, is not even the most fascinating moment to come around. Following this sequence comes a smart and engaging plot of Cruise's character Ethan Hunt on a globe-trotting mission to pursue a James Bond-like villain, and the plot unfolds in a pulse-pounding two-hour stretch brimming with dazzling action sequences done with nifty camera work by Robert Elswit, including a reckless, death-defying car chase, and hype-kinetic motorcycle chase to fuel the excitement of film goers.What is a Mission Impossible flick without a gripping story? Christopher McQuarrie arousing screenplay comes in. The plot kicks off in an shocking sequence featuring the kidnapping of our lead character Ethan Hunt, and the introduction of the villain played by Sean Harris who's performance fits well with the charismatic antagonist. From there on, the plot moves at a generally solid pace with suspense and twists lurking around nearly every corner, and a fistful of energy on lock. Along the way, the film introduces some hot new characters, one of which is Ilsa Faust who is played by Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson, who makes a stylish portrayal as a fascinating, but highly questionable character who may or may not the good girl Ethan Hunt is hoping to join forces with. Then there is Simon Pegg reprising his role as Benjy in this third film of the franchise. Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames also reprise their roles as William Brandt and Luther Stickell, though are given rather limited to do other than to serve as key figures in the film's minor subplots. Lastly, there is Tom Cruise who returns as Ethan Hunt, and is more likable and ravaging with energy than ever. The actor remains well-suited as the action star he's been for almost the past two decades. Though he's understandably not everyone's cup of tea, his endurance in his roles as Ethan Hunt over the years are certainly admirable.Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is a decent continuation to the franchise, and a pleasing treat for action fans everywhere. Tom Cruise is amazing, the action is top-notch, and the plot works well. This movie is simply a blast.",8,1,2,16 December 2015
Jarhead," Harrowing and bold look at the life of a Marine
","Sam Mendes, director of American Beauty (1999), takes a step into the war genre with this Gulf War-set war movie, based on the autobiography by Anthony Swafford. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swafford, a young man from Sacremento, who enlist in the U.S Marine Corps in the late 1980s. Surviving through boot camp under the ruthless Drill Sergeant Sykes (played by Jamie Foxx), Swafford makes it out as a sniper, and he and his unit are stationed in Saudi Arabia. With the 1991 Persian Gulf War erupting, Swafford and the unit are plagued with personal issues such as homesickness, humiliation, abuse, frustration, and fear of girlfriends' infidelity. This is until Operation Desert Storm breaks out and the unit find their chance to finally get the taste of what war is really all about. As explained in the movie, Jarhead is the slang term for a Marine. Jarhead is not quite your typical war movie, this war is more of a comedy than an combat action-heavy film. Many war movie fans may be disappointed as this movie revolves more on how war affects the main character as well as his fellow marines than soldiers engaging in violent, bloodshed combat, with very few scenes of actual combat on screen. I was a little disappointed in some ways. Unlike most war films, the plot in this one focuses on what soldiers do when they're not in active combat. While the plot is okay, it could have been better written. There are various points in the film where the plot seems to stumble. For the most of the first half, we are treated with scenes of Marines sharing conversation about their sexual experiences, watching pornographic videos, pulling pranks on each others, comparing girls, sneaking booze and throwing wild parties. It very realistically portrays the daily lives of Marines off the battlefield. Jake Gyllenhaal's character is develops so well throughout the film, and you see as how the war begins to change him. The scene when has a mental breakdown towards one of his fellow marines gives a clear demonstration of how war begins consuming him. Gyllenhaal's performance was good, and Jamie Foxx did alright as well. I can't say their performances are Oscar-worthy though. One major flaw with this film is that it lacks emotional investment, and so while the characters' emotions are evident, they don't feel real or engaging.Overall, Jarhead is not bad movie. Yes, it has its ups and downs here and there. However, it is certainly not one I would recommendable to everyone. Maybe those who are big Jake Gyllenhaal's fans would be the best people to recommend to.",8,1,3,18 August 2015
Dark City," Thoroughly mind-bending and visually arresting, Dark City is a thrillingly fresh science-fiction tale that really works
","Set in a bleak dystopian world, Dark City, directed by Alex Poryas of 'The Crow', is a mind-bending science-fiction vehicle that aims to challenge audiences at a psychological level while pushing the boundaries of cerebral ideas. It is a film aiming to grip moviegoers with an arresting visual style while capitalizing on a chock full of concepts that feel fresh. Tautly paced and piercing with a complex narrative, Dark City never holds back when splashing viewers with cutting-edge of surprises and unpredictable twists. The central figure of this compelling tale is an amnesiac man fighting for the truth in a world where nothing is what he appears and reality is distorted to alarming proportions. And it is the mind-bending plot that is the driving force of this twisted tale. Alex Poryas handles the story immense precision without resorting to overly familiar elements. It is more than safe to say that his effort prevail. In deeper words, his efforts amount to something that feels groundbreaking. This film is set in a world where the sun never rises and the cities are blanketed with everlasting nightfall. John Murdoch (played by Rufus Sewell) wakes up in a bathtub with no memory of his past or Emma (played by Jennifer Connolly), a woman who claims to be his wife. When Murdoch is alerted by Dr. Daniel Schreiber (played by Kiefer Sutherland) of Detective Frank Bumstead (played by William Hurt) who is hunting down for a series of grisly murders he has no memory of committing. Murdoch must evade Bumstead and uncover the truth of his past while running evading a league of alien-like humans known as The Strangers who each have dubious tricks under their sleeves.Is this guy a murderer? Is he innocent? Is there a corrupt side of the law enforcement officer? Each questions lies in the heat battle between the lead character and the enigmatic truth that hidden by an enemy beyond his imagination. Director Alex Poryas drives the story with a plot where the some of the most shocking surprises are not what we know but what we don't know. One thing that Poryas accomplishes here is keeping things unpredictable from beginning to end. In the process, the film holds no barrs when challenging viewers' expectations and placing the characters in a ramshackle of shocking twists and grim conspiracies. While Poryas leaves room for a few action set pieces, he keeps it suppressed for the most of the second half before delivering a visually stunning climatic battle during the final twenty minutes. As for the visual department, Poryas proves himself highly a dazzling production design of a dystopian society plunged into darkness, owing elements to Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' with a slice of 'Blade Runner'. Rufus Sewell's John Murdoch makes for an appealing protagonist, the character that manages to stand out considerably among the supporting cast of underdeveloped characters. Although Sewell's performance occasionally fluctuates between strong and clunky, he mostly gets the job done. Jennifer Connolly plays Emma with great humility and fortitude, and his romance with John is fine, but never quite sizzles. William Hurt embraces his character with humanity without straying into the portrayal of over-the-topness. But he is certainly not a villain that hits a home-run. Kiefer Sutherland gets his time to shine, but the lack of depth in this character limit his ability to fully blossom his talent in the role. It appears that John Murdoch is the only firmly developed character in the pack which makes him unsurprisingly easy to root for. Dark City is a thoroughly mind-bending science-fiction trek, shining with chord-striking visual compulsion and a story that is enormously engaging, if slightly flawed in its roots. The movie will more than likely not appeal to individuals alienated by a dark atmosphere, hence the title, or intellectually challenging narrative. But for others, it is a chord-striking experience and a sucker punch achievement in its genre.",9,4,6,13 July 2017
Dunkirk," Christopher Nolan's rendition of one of World War II's most relevant battles explodes for a breathtaking experience
","Hollywood mogul Christopher Nolan is a filmmaker who almost always knows how to hit the right notes in every genre he ventures. Stepping away from the realm of comic book adaptations and science- fiction, Nolan tests the waters of the war genre in this harrowing retelling is one of most heroic events of World War II in the European front. The journey here is through the terrifying atmosphere of the Dunkirk evacuation following a brutal defeat by the Germany army, and Nolan's take on this event is, in the simplest words, breathtaking. It is a powerful story of survival that capitalizes on tension from the opening scene to the very end, and if Nolan proves anything, it is that he more than knows how to keeps moving without sparing even in a single dull moment throughout its runtime. From a technical scaled to its narrative heft, he becomes the driving force of leading its ensemble cast on the road through one of the defining events of the second war. Set in 1940, this film focuses on the story of 400,000 soldiers of the Allied Powers trapped on the beach of Dunkirk, France by the German Air Force raining down bombs and gunning down the poor soldiers down below. Escaping on the naval ships accompanied by English Admiral (played by Kenneth Branagh), the soldiers are just miles away from home but are forced to deal with the overwhelming German air force attacking them in, that is until the British air force comes to their rescue. The film follows three intertwining perspectives, the first involving British soldiers Tommy (played by Fionn Whitehead) and who escapes with fellow soldiers (one played by pop-star Harry Styles) on a boat across the sea while dodging enemy fire from above. The second one following British spitfire pilot Farriet (played by Tom Hardy) and his squadron fending off against German pilots thousands of feet above the English channel, and another one following Mr. Dawnson (played by Mark Rylance) commanding a private ship on the sea with the help of his son Peter and a young local teenager, while saving a fallen, disoriented soldier (played by Cillian Murphy) in the process. This war epic is not much more of a war film than it is a survival flick. After all, the goal of these thousand soldiers was to fight against the invading German Air Force for their life in what was seemingly a hopeless situation until the British Air Force arrived on scene. Christopher Nolan captures every moment with stunning emotional resonance and palpable authenticity, and the tension smoldering each sequence almost never lets up. Opening with a British Private played by Fionn Whitehead, Nolan dedicates virtually no time into developing any of the character following their introductions on screen, so there is never a character we are able to emotionally latch onto, let alone distinguish as nearly every character is identical to their dark hair and green army uniforms. The politics behind the battle are left alone as well. Instead, Nolan jumps straight into the action showing the harrowing chaos of these soldiers on land, air, and sea. Similar to 'Memento', Nolan also uses a bold method of experimenting with time, which involves presenting the story into three separate perspectives intertwining with each other. While his method is somewhat effective, it also exhibits the disadvantage of occasionally complicating the storyline, especially as each separate segment takes place within varying amounts of time. On the bright side, his method does very little hinder the gripping realism of each sequence which are shot by Hoyte Van Hoytema who captures the claustrophobia of the soldiers trapped in a sinking ship and Tom Hardy confined inside the cockpit while fighting off German pilots. As this film carries a PG- 13 rating, unused in the war genre, Nolan strays away from the graphic carnage of these sequences in place of capturing the paranoia and emotional devastation of the soldiers, most of which is nicely assisted by a soaring score by Hans Zimmer. Do not go in expecting blood splatters and limbs blown off. And for the performances, everyone in the cast gets the done - - none of whom stand among the rest. Dunkirk is a powerful, breathtaking war epic that shows Christopher Nolan breathing life into the war genre with spectacular realism and an emotionally gripping tone, while honoring the brave heroes during the harrowing event. This movie reminds moviegoers of the director's talent that ravages the beauty of Hollywood. In other words, it is surprising to say this film could stand as one of the most profound movies of the year, possibly even worthy for some talk for the Oscars.",9,1,7,22 July 2017
Aliens," James Cameron's Aliens is a superb science-fiction experience that improves upon its predecessor
","Ridley Scott left a major landmark on the science-fiction genre when he brought birth to 1979's 'Alien'. Treating audiences with engrossing visual imagery and hair-raising thrills, there is almost no wonder the film journeyed to success. This follow-up to the science-fiction thriller arrives with more of the same pulse- pounding human vs. alien onslaught, only with more and bigger surprises. Replacing Ridley Scott in the director's chair is visionary James Cameron following his success with science-fiction hit 'Terminator'. Cameron comes to the picture with a slightly more thoughtful direction and a bigger package of spine-chilling thrills and sharp visual effects that amount to a masterful sci-fi experience. Reducing on the suspenseful atmosphere in favor of more even balance of action and white-knuckle thrills, the film never fails to show Cameron knows how to keep things working. Set almost six decades after the first entry, this film sees the return of Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, who wakes up from a cryogenic sleep and is facing charges from the catastrophe that lead to the death of her crew. With everyone back on Earth failing to buy into her story, Ripley goes on an investigation to another planet with a crew of space marines which include Corporal Hicks (played by Michael Biehn), Burke (played by Paul Reiser), Bishop (played by Lance Henrickson), Private Hudson (played by Bill Paxton), Lieutenant Gorman (played by William Hope), and Private Vazquez (played by Jenette Goldstein) along with a few others. Stumbling upon a colony of alien eggs that soon hatch and launch a violent onslaught against the crew, Ripley and the crew must fight to survive against the vicious horde while protecting a little girl named Newt (played by Carrie Henn) who's family has been killed. Whereas the previous film relied heavily on suspense and Ridley Scott's Gothic imagery to unleash the thrills, James Cameron goes a significantly different route in portraying the humans' heart-racing battle against the grotesque-looking extraterrestrial creatures. This amounts to splicing some action sequences in the mix of the eerie atmosphere, which pits the characters in a scarier and more heart-pumping fight for survival against an overwhelming colony of flesh-eaters. By all means, Cameron's method works like a charm. He successfully showcases an even balance that of pulse-pounding action and rollicking thrills in a mix that effectively places viewers in a boiling good time, but not that isn't prone to inducing nightmares. The first half focuses on the buildup of the characters along with exposition before transpiring to the second half which eventually places its foot on the gas for some white-knuckle, if occasionally gory alien onslaught. To add spice to the tension, the film powerfully showcases the vulnerability of Carrie Henn's Newt, a small defenseless little youngster who Ellen Ripley must protect in the midst of the chaos. Although there are maybe a few dull moments sprinkled throughout the picture, Cameron never seems to struggle to keep things moving. The space marine characters are slightly more developed and the chemistry between each of them which includes a few brief dosages of humor and wit. Alongside, Cameron also manages to feast the eyes with striking visual imagery painting the inside of the spaceship, capturing the sheer claustrophobia of the settings while paying reminiscence to the original film. With Ellen Ripley being the sole survivor of the aftermath of the first film, Sigourney Weaver returns to the lead role and is good as ever, if not slightly more. Weaver executes the role with same versatility and emotional grit of a strong female protagonist similar to the predecessor, particularly with her tough-as-nails line 'Get away from her, you bitch!'. The rest of cast consists of newcomers to the franchise including Paul Reiser as Corporal Hicks who shows off with a fairly decent performance. Michael Biehn plays Burke, a slightly more sinister and antagonistic member of the crew who shows little care of placing the crew in mortal danger. Biehn's performance stands strong, but certainly not in a fashion that stands out among anyone. Lance Henrickson does a fairly job at Bishop, the valiant one in the group. Jenette Goldstein, who would later go on to collaborate with James Cameron again for a minor role in 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day', boasts an incredible amount of charisma in her role with a small slice of witty humor added to the mix. Then, there is young Carrie Henn who plays Newt, a small girl who becomes a daughterly-like figure to Sigourney Weaver during the terrifying chaos. The film does a magnificent job on not only showcasing the vulnerability of the small-aged character, but beautifully establishing the emotional bond between her and Weaver. The rest of the large cast also succeeds in getting the job. Nothing however, that comes close to blowing Sigourney Weaver out of the water. Aliens is a superb science-fiction experience that boasts a thoughtful direction by visionary film mogul James Cameron, and an astounding blend of terrifying visual imagery and heart-stopping thrills. The film makes the rare achievement of improving upon the original, and that further demonstrates Cameron's immense talent.",9,5,7,22 May 2017
Dallas Buyers Club," Matthew McConaughey does well
","I remember watching the 86th Oscar awards and this movie won three Oscars including best actor which was given to Matthew McConaughey. I didn't think the movie looked that good to me until I watched last night. I have to say, I was impressed.Dallas buyers club follows the story of Ron Woodruff (McConaughey) who's been diagnosed with aids and is given only thirty days left to live. After taking a medication, he ends up healing it. Following this success, he begins selling the medication to people around the world in order to make a profit with the help of a drag queen (Jared Leto). The performances were really outstanding, McConaughey and Leto did a pretty decent job with their acting and I definitely like well the story progressed throughout the film. I was little weirded by Jared Leto dressing up as a woman, but of course he's playing a drag queen. The entire second half of the movie was favorite part because of how the story picks up its pace.",10,1,2,23 April 2014
Now You See Me," Fun and energetic heist-thriller with a marvelous cast
","From Louis Leterrier, director of The Transporter (2002), Transporter 2 (2005), and The Incredible Hulk, this crime heist-thriller follows four magicians: Daniel Atlas (played by Jesse Eisenberg), Merrit McKinney (played by Woody Harrelson) Henley Reeves (played by Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder (played by Dave Franco), who host a reality show on-stage where they use their magic skills to rob banks around the world. Their amazing magical abilities soon draw to attention to FBI agents Dylan Rhodes and Alma Dray (played by Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent) who go investigation in search of an explanation behind their robberies, and an eccentric mastermind Thaddeus Bradley (played by Morgan Freeman) who desperately tries to expose their illusional power, leading a wild chase in search for secrets and hidden plots.Now You See Me boast some creative ideas and executes them in an 'okay' way. I can't say I was too impressed with them. With the plot involving magicians who use teleportation techniques to rob banks for living, you would expect few plot twist and turns somewhere along the way. Sadly this film doesn't have much of these. But that's okay, the thoughtful storytelling, decently constructed characters, and strong pacing make up for some of it. The biggest disappointment however, is that the film lacks suspense and thrills that make it more exciting. The whole premise of how the characters use their magic to manipulate the minds of people is clever, but it's never gets interesting. The cast is very great on the other hand. Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Franco demonstrate some great performances as the main characters. Morgan Freeman did an alright job as the main antagonist, although he felt a bit miscast. Overall, Now You See Me isn't too bad of a movie. Maybe if the plot was better developed or at least was a given a better direction, this will would feel more captivating. Also, suspense and thrills are what is this film is missing and really needs.",7,0,1,11 October 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Stunning
","I can't tell you how incredible this was. This would probably the best film of X-men series, why? First, the story was fantastic and never lost my attention. Secondly, the characters were pretty amazing, especially Wolverine. While he always the central character of the franchise, Hugh Jackman portrays him well and his performances never gets old. Jennifer Lawrence also did decent job as Mystique. The rest of the characters were pretty good as well.The fight action scenes were definitely the best parts of the movie, mostly because of its eye popping special(and visual) effects. The opening scene with the mutants fighting against the sentinel robots and the final battle towards the end were my favorite scenes of the movie.This is best movie I've seen this year so far. I'm excited for the this series next installment, which is called X-Men Apocalypse and set to be released in May 2016.",10,1,2,26 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Fun superhero action adventure goes out with a bang
","It's that time of the year again when the theaters flood with the mega-budget summer blockbusters that scale the mountain at the box office, and Marvel superhero flicks are no strangers to this. After the successful but disappointment of DC's 'Batman Vs Superman' early this spring, many fans were hoping to see a comeback in the superhero genre, this third installment of the highly successful Captain America franchise pays off not only defying expectations but even improving upon its predecessor. With Joe and Anthony Russo turning to the directors' chairs, this superhero action flick sees Chris Evans reprising the role of the titular character along with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Anthony Mackie as Falcon, Don Cheadle as War Machine, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Elizabeth Olson as Scarlet Witch, and Paul Bettany as Vision. Taking the place after the events of 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron', the team has fallen under massive political scrutiny by the government for all the damage resulted in their battles against the threats. In response, the government passes a bill that puts limits on the superheroes actions requiring them to work under government surveillance. Tony Stark (Iron Man) and the team agree with bill and sign it, Steve Rogers (Captain America) in the other hand disapproves of it and chooses to go outside the law. When Steve Rogers refuses to turn in Bucky Barnes (played by Sebastian Stan) who is wanted by the government, this leads an all-out conflict between the team. Newcomers joining the cast include Tom Holland as Spider-Man, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther. The film bears strong similarities to Batman Vs Superman in terms of plot as deals with the tension between two heroes, only Civil War manages to execute the plot more effectively and cohesive. As the plot sets in, the heroes come face-to-face with government officials who give an disheartening inside look of all the damage caused by their actions and the lives lost in result of the battles. In many superhero flicks, mass destruction of a city has become a gimmick in the genre. But the first time in the genre, this gimmick is actually acknowledged by our heroes who grow genuine sympathy for the damage that costs. From there on, the story dives deep into the politics of managing the team and the debate that ensues when Captain America develops a cold shoulder against the government's decisions and the team's agreement. In the end, whether you agree with the government's plan to impose the limit on the superheros' action or Captain America's disapproval for the plan becomes the question. Thanks to our brilliant writers, the story does a great job at balancing the dispute between the heroes and the inference of the political actions to the point where many will find it easy to see both sides of the argument. Furthermore, the film strives some incredible, prolonged action sequences while leaving enough room to flesh out most of the characters. The humanity in the characters is put on the spot, and made to be believable. Yes, this film is a bit crowded in its roster of characters but with it's smart screenplay it manages to work.When comes a superhero actioner comes some of exciting, pulse-pounding action sequences sparkled with not only tense special effects and CGI but powerfully choreographed stunt work. As viewers come expectations, the action scenes are fun to play watch, and serve as the biggest eye-catchers. And no one should the forget the incredible special effects or even the outstanding fight choreography featured in a scene with Black Widow in one scene at the beginning. No one can argue the stunt doubles' amazing talent in some of the fight scenes. Arguably the best scene in the film takes place at an airport where all our heroes engage in an all-out battle filled outstanding FX and some hilarious dialogue thrown out by the characters, particularly Spider-Man who is given much more comedic portrayal than in the previous Spiderman entries. The actors are quite clever in their roles as ever, and do almost nothing to disappoint. Tom Holland is surprisingly good as Spider-Man considering the roles in his last filmography. Whether his portrayal is better than Andrew Garfield's or Tobey Maguire's is debatable. Nonetheless, he nails it.Captain America: Civil War is a fun and outstanding start to this summer of big-budget blockbusters, and another astounding achievement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This film is destined to reach massive numbers at the box office, even by those who may not be grown fans of the Marvel superheroes.",9,10,20,6 May 2016
American History X," Powerful, unflinching portrayal of racism
","Racism is major issue that has been going on America for many generations now, and what still goes on in our society today. Many may be familiar with some of the most notorious racist gangs such as the Ku Klux Klan or the Aryan Brotherhood It has negatively affected the way we function as a society and lead to many tragedies and controversies in many areas of our society. This dark drama directed by Tony Kaye paints a powerful and brutal picture on racism and bigotry, and the consequences they can be lead to. Set in Venice Beach, California, this film stars Edward Norton as Derek Vinyard, a once-happy young man with a healthy family who lost his father after he was shot by an African-American for simply doing his job. Angered by the circumstances of his death, Derek turns from an innocent young man into a cold, hate-filled skinhead, and becomes the leader of a white supremacist gang who exercises hatred against every racial group outside the white protestant. After getting arrested for brutally killing a black man who tries to rob his car, Derek spends three years in prison where he unexpectedly develops a bond with black man Lamont (played by Guy Torry) who teaches them that not all black men are evil. Upon leaving the prison, Derek comes home as a changed man, but learns that his younger brother Danny (played by Edward Furlong) is heading down the same path and tries to help him from suffering the same fate.This movie is made to paint a realistic portrayal of the life of skinheads, and the consequences that ensue. The film succeeds this feat very well and what results is a dark and gritty powerhouse drama that is incredibly difficult to watch. Writer David McKenna gives a powerful, if horrifying treatment to the characters and the story, and when it all comes on-screen, it pulls the audience into a dark atmosphere that rarely lets them rest. During the opening scene, we are introduced to the main character Derek Vinyard, sporting a shaved head and a swastika tattooed on his chest, representing him as a Neo- Nazi, within those minutes; we learn the atrocities of this character and his cruel, racist aspect. Vinyard is played by Edward Norton is astoundingly convicted in the role, he just swallows up the role with his performance and the scenes of his character spitting at others with his cold-hearted bigotry and hatred feel frighteningly real.When tackling the issues of racism, the story does not hold back nor does it try to manipulate audience with emotionality as both the emotional (and physical) intensity come almost naturally through the visceral storytelling. The story is told with a subplot of Derek's younger brother Danny being assigned by his principal Dr. Sweeney (played by Avery Brooks) to write about Derek after his teacher (who is Jewish) sends him to the office for submitting an offensive essay on the book 'Mein Kempf'. The story progresses through Danny typing up his paper while jumping back and forth through a series of flashbacks (shown in black and white) showing the brothers' significant moments related to their white supremacy. These scenes include disorienting hate speeches against blacks, Asians, Jews, and pretty much every foreign racial group by Derek, a supermarket raid, a more detail and disturbing depiction of the murder Derek commits, and his experience of redemption he gained while serving time in prison. The story flows on well without just a minor flaw towards the end dealing a revelation of the character's racist behavior that feels a bit too tacked at the last minute. And it builds up to the one of the most shocking and heart-wrenching endings that leaves you speechless.American History X is very brutal portrayal of racism, and one that is very difficult to sit through. But at the same time, it is very important film to watch as it teaches viewers a powerful message about how racism not only hurts others, but can devastate you as a person. Edward Norton's performance is absolutely amazing and the writing is utterly inspiring at its best. This is a film I recommend, but probably not to those under 17 as the material can be very challenging to handle, even for the most harden individuals.",9,0,1,5 March 2016
Pearl Harbor," Michael Bay's World War II is entertaining, yet deeply flawed
","For the past two decades now, Michael Bay has been known littering his films with countless explosions, and with this heavy special effects, garners wide success at the box office. Here, Michael Bay steps into the war genre with this intense, dramatic retelling of the fateful event that pulled America into World War II in the 1941. Set near the dawn of World War II, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett play Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, two Airforce soldiers who have been best friends since childhood. As they grow up, they are caught in a love triangle when they both fall in love with beautiful nurse named Evelyn (played by Kate Beckinsale). Things get pretty complicated when Danny and Evelyn are transferred to Pearl Harbor where Rafe returns from fighting overseas in Great Britain to find the two are in a relationship. Next morning, December 7, Danny and Rafe wake up to find hundreds of Japanese fighter pilots dropping bombs on Pearl Harbor. The two friends arm themselves with the F-51s in attempt to fight off against the Japanese fleet. With the U.S naval base devastated and thousands of innocent lives lost, the U.S declares war against war. From there on, Dafe and Rafe and their army lead by Lieutenant Colonol James Dolittle (played by Alec Baldwin) prepare for a fight against Japan to overcome their country's catastrophic defeat. This film also features Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Captain Dorie Miller, the first African- American in history to be awarded the U.S Navy Cross.The bombing of Pearl Harbor was one of the most shocking moments in the history of America, and it makes interesting subject matter to be told on on screen. Although this movie does manage to paint the horrors that took place during that fateful day, this film does suffer from some flaws that director Michael Bay is often known. Now with a war movie being directed by Bay, audience should go into this movie expecting abundance of explosions and this film plenty of these during the 40-minute action sequences that takes place during the attack on Pearl Harbor. The entire scene is very well done and the special effects are great. The scene really captures the grim details of what the civilians of Pearl Harbor suffered through as we watch countless of people killed from gunfire and drowning, as well as others who suffer some gruesome injuries. This entire scene is quite difficult to watch and it really pulls at your heart strings. Now here is where the film falters. Along with the whole Japanese attack and its aftermath, audiences are treated with a romantic subplot involving Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, and Kate Beckinsale that takes up a good portion of the film. What we get from this is poor acting and cheesy dialogue between Affleck and Beckinsale, including a line 'I love you so much it hurts', a line that is highly laughable and far too corny, especially when dealing with a war flick. The whole love story is not terrible, but definitely takes more than what is needed of the film. With the whole story, the film ends up running 183 minutes. Pearl Harbor is certainly not one of the best war movies in Hollywood and definitely not the best of what Michael Bay has to offer. I feel that this could have done better if it was handled someone like Steven Spielberg who has been masterful with the World War II genre (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List). Overall, this is film is not terrible. Despite some of its flaws, it still works and is entertaining to watch.",7,19,28,8 December 2015
Tropic Thunder," Ben Stiller's Hollywood satire fare is subversive and audacious, yet wildly funny
","Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder is a comedy that opens the door to arguably the most clever and groundbreaking spoof of Hollywood politics ever to put to film. This action comedy hybrid makes the score not solely on outrageously belly laughs, but tackling original ways on poking fun at the extravagant world of Hollywood and perhaps the entertainment business itself. Director and actor Ben Stiller serves as the hefty hand for bringing this subversive comedy to life in ways that without a doubt questionable and have stirred up a fair amount of controversy. At the same time, he makes an inspiring achievement at bringing birth to one of the most audacious, yet funny comedic vehicles in recent years. Opening up with fake four trailers introducing the four main characters each as Hollywood actors, this movie follows the story of a film crew lead by English filmmaker Damien Cockburn (played by Steve Coogan) who must lead a group of prima donna actors including: Tugg Speedman (played by Ben Stiller), a Sylvestor Stallone-like action star, Jeff Portnoy (played by Jack Black), a comedic star of a popular comedy franchise known for flatulence jokes, rapper Alpa Chino (played by Brandon T. Jackson), Kirk Lazuras (played by Robert Downey Jr.), an Austrailan actor undergoing a controversial blackface make-up alteration to portray an African-American soldier, and Hollywood newcomer Kevin Sandusky (played by Jay Baruchul). These actors are making a Vietnam War movie based on the memoir by U.S veteran John Fourleaf (played by Nick Nolte). Frustrated by the actors' incompetent acting skills, Cockburn is adviced by Fourleaf to drop them into the the jungles of Vietnam where they are forced to rely on their acting talent to survive against a dangerous Vietnamese drug cartel. This satirical action comedy operates not only as a near-endless cornucopia of raunchy sex jokes and snappy comedic dialogue, but also a fresh source of smart (and hilarious) spoofs of popular war movies. Opening up the story is the characters in their fictional acting forms performing a gruesome, yet appropriately unrealistic combat sequence pays a sweet homage to Oliver Stone's 'Platoon'. While the special effects including explosions going off and the sight of an actor disemboweled by an Vietnamese bayonet serve as shocking eye meat, the humor is what sets the tone of the story. From there on, the plot settles in with the lead characters dropped off in the jungle of Vietnam where their filmmaking experience turns into a dangerously real 'Apocalypse Now'-like adventure with plenty of snappy meta humor and social commentary of the showbiz thrown around and about. Although Ben Stiller is not well-known for pushing the envelop with audacious humor, he manages to stretch the boundaries with character sporting dubious tropes that very few (if any) cinematic entries are capable of even getting away. One of the attention-grabbing is his character Tugg Speedman's loathed portrayal of a mentally impaired farmer named in a film within the film 'Simple Jack' which has raised the eyebrows of many including the mentally handicapped community. Though some will be able to engage in the satirical purposes behind this fictional figure, there is a certain level of offense that shouldn't be ignored. Another questionable of course, would be Robert Downey Jr. playing a race- altering role in the form of blackface that while adds to some witty satirical commentary, can also be seen as a rather bold move. Ben Still makes an astounding achievement of assembling an overwhelmingly inspiring cast to the screen, blending the crowd with some comedic veterans and more dramatic actors. And joining the ensemble cast is director Ben Stiller himself as the main character Tugg Speedman, who serves as an action star drawn as a homage of Sylvestor Stallone in the popular 'Rambo' franchise. Stiller breaths plenty of charisma and comedic fever into the role, it is hard not to admire. Grabbing the public attention is Robert Downey Jr. playing an African-American soldier who suits as an opposite of his real-life caucasian persona (both within and outside the film). Downey proves himself charismatic in the role, and brings major appeal to his otherwise controversial character. Jack Black, stepping the role of a Chris Farley-like comedic star, adds some good comedic touch as does Brandon T. Jackson as the Ludicrous-like Hip-Hop star. Jay Barachul is good, but brings nothing truly memorable due to the limit in which this character is written. Danny McBride as the pyrotechnics operator does his job here. Playing Speedman's agent is fellow Matthew McConaughey is makes a surprising on screen presence. But arguably the most shocking performance displayed on screen as Tom Cruise who sports a bald cap and fat suit to portray a foul-mouthed studio executive who goes trigger-happy with sprouting F-bombs every minute he's on screen. While his performance does shine, the biggest shocker is learning who is the character is as his bald cap and fat suit render him completely unrecognizable, especially as the actor is somewhat of a stranger in the comedic territory. Tropic Thunder is a wildly entertaining take on Hollywood satire, generated with outrageous laughs and powerfully appealing performances an inspiring cast. At the very best, the film marks not only an exhilarating entry in the comedy genre, but also an inspiring demonstration at Ben Stiller's directing chops. This movie doesn't hold back on being wildly irreverent and audacious with humor, but that's the good news.",9,6,10,12 April 2017
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," For a sweet, funny video game-style action thrill ride, Scott Pilgrim makes the score
","It's funny, it's clever, it's undeniably sweet, and it all comes from the pages of Bryan O'Malley's hit graphic novel series of the same name. This romantic action comedy is not your average romantic comedy, it is a subversive action comedy that shuttles far from the usual rom-com conventions. Director Edgar Wright, following the success of 'Shaun of The Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz', orchestrates an electrifying love story with a style that echoes the works of comic books. Blending the action with subtle humor, clever pop culture references, and video game-style elements; this movie pulls viewers in for hyper-kinetic, stylized fun from beginning to end. And the main figure in the film's spotlight is charming comedic star Michael Cera, stepping in the shoes of the eponymous character. Set in Toronto, Canada, this film star Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim, a 22- year old slacker who's life consists of playing guitar with his band known as Sex Bob-Omb and sharing an apartment with his gay roommate Wallace (played by Kieran Culkin). While dating an underage Asian girl named Knives (played by Ellen Wong), Scott fantasizes about a hot American girl named Ramona Flowers (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Upon meeting her at a party, Scott forms a relationship with her while dumping his Asian girlfriend in the process. Their relationship quickly becomes disrupted however, when Ramona's seven evil ex-lovers are targeting him. With his relationship with Ramona at stake, Scott must defeat her seven ex-lovers in a series of comic book-style battles in order to win her heart.This movie is a sweet romantic comedy that takes its genre and polishes it with a shockingly creative twist that is likely to win the hearts of a much larger demographic. Unlike most romantic comedies which often nowadays slip in the cracks of formula and corniness, this entry pedals on a radical execution that transcends an average love story into a cartoon-style battle of good versus evil. As eccentric as this concept sounds, Edgar Wright makes diligent effort to make this one work. Opening with the Universal Pictures logo pinned an 8-bit fanfare, this film sets the character in a world incorporated with video game elements including a soundtrack from the 'Legend of Zelda' series which makes it way a dream sequence. The concept however, plays a major role in the hyper-kinetic fighting sequences when the titular character is force to face down against the former lovers of his new girlfriend. With animated heads-up display popping on screen and retro video game sound effects playing, these action sequences deliver pulse-pounding thrills that not only intend to keep viewers glued to their seats but serve as love letters for the video-game nerds. The sequences and the story itself move at a solidly fast pace, and there is rarely a moment that is wasted here. Although the caricature style of the action will definitely not be everyone's cup of tea, it sets out to be entertaining and not be taken seriously.Michael Cera makes a reasonable impression in the eponymous role. Suiting in his typical awkward teenager typecasting, Cera gives a charismatic portrayal of the titular character, sparkling the role with charm and humor. His quirkiness makes a match for his lover Ramona Flowers who is beautifully portrayed by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. While her bold performance stands well, the real driving force behind her romance with Michael Cera is not their cold chemistry but his desperate will to win her heart no matter what it takes to do so. The duo share a good amount of comedic bond with humor and dialogue that veers in the realm of subtly. Easily one of their most witty scenes takes place when Ramona metaphorically says 'we all have baggage' and Scott responds 'Yeah, well my baggage doesn't try to kill me ever five minutes', lines that shed small light in each of the characters's pasts with ex- lovers. Meanwhile, the story is driven the action between Scott and Ramona's ex-lovers which include a cast of Chris Evans, Jason Schwartzmann, Mae Whitman (Yes, a girl), Brandon Routh, Satya Bhahba, and a duo of Chinese actors -- most of which get a nice swipe at some clever humor. The rest of cast including Johnny Simmons, Kieran Culkin, Mark Webber, Anna Kendrick, and Alison Pill make good use of their screen time; nothing more, nothing less. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is a sweet, funny, video game-style comedy polished with plenty of stylized action and brainy humor, and makes for an entertaining testament to Bryan O'Malley's source material. Edgar Wright embraces an over-the-top cartoony style, and makes surprisingly good use with it. And for those who believe only video game fans or teen rom-com fanatics will find appeal out of this, think again!",9,0,0,10 April 2017
Inside Out," Amazing and thoughtful gift from Pixar
","Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios bring pure imagination and creativity to this delightful family film where the rules of psychology are bent. This film answers the question of what happens when your emotions control you instead of you controlling your emotions. Following the story of eleven-year old Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) who moves with her family to San Francisco from her comfortable life in Minnesota, we experience her emotions going on her head as faces anxiety of her new home, new school, and a whole new life; and her emotions are represented by colored characters including: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) is yellow, Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith) is blue, Fear (voiced by Bill Hader) is purple, and Disgust (voiced by Mindy Karling) is green. These characters work in an 'industrial' corporation inside Riley's head that basically controls her emotions and memories as she navigates through life of happiness, despair, and hope. Inside Out is not your average Pixar movie that many expect. This film is targeted at both children and adults, but at the same time tackles on mature and complex themes that young kids are not too likely to understand well. It takes the rules of how human psychology works and plays around with them, with characters representing a young girl's emotions using an actual electronic console to control the emotions she expresses during her everyday life. The whole concept is a bit complex and enough to make young kids question the reality of psychology. Nonetheless, the idea is astoundingly creative and will definitely entertain kids and adults like; and this movie really explores some amazing things with the idea. Even if kids don't understand some the ideas, they will still find them cute and funny. There are plenty of scenes of laughter as well as some emotional and tear-jerking moments that Pixar films are often known for. Inside Out is a movie that delivers some of the best taste Pixar has to offer and will bring joy to the whole family. It is very cute, very heartwarming, and filled with some interesting surprises. I should also remind you to sit during the end credits as they offer some fun and interesting scenes.",10,5,29,21 November 2015
Die Hard 2," Entertaining, but slightly inferior Die Hard sequel
","Bruce Willis makes his return as the iconic hero John McClane who was last scene taking down a dozen German terrorists one by one at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles in one of the most crowd pleasing action flicks of all time. Taking place exactly one year after the events of the first film, John McClane is awaiting for his wife Holly (played by Bonnie Bedelia again) at the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C to spend another great Christmas with her. His plans quickly go bad once again when a group of international terrorists led by Colonel Stuart (played by William Sadler) began seizing control of the airport and taking countless innocent civilians hostage. To make matters worse, the terrorists began taking control of the air traffic control, causing runway lights to shut off and inference in traffic signals. With planes full of innocent lives (including his wife) running low on fuel and unable to land safely, McClane must once again use his incredible skills to take down the merciless terrorists and the save the lives of the passengers along with his wife, once for all. With John McTiernan returning as the director, this movie comes as a decent continuation to the franchise; with some exciting action scenes and well-drawn characters and performances. However, this film fell slightly short of the formula that made the first film a smash hit. The main villain Colonel is not quite as memorable as Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman in the previous film. While William Sadler gives a great performance, his character doesn't have the same charisma as Gruber. On the other hands, the action scenes are a bit exciting and well shot, especially the intense fight scene that takes place on the wing of the plane towards the end. Most of the action takes place outside in the snow and blistering cold winds. Then there is John McClane who still remains fresh as ever and is energized with a strong performance by Bruce Willis. Lastly, the plot works pretty well, although there some inconsistencies here and there. Overall, it was enjoyable at the least.Die Hard 2: Die Harder may not be as memorable as the first film, but there is no doubt that this film is quite a thrill ride and Bruce Willis shows that he still has John McClane in him.",7,1,1,5 December 2015
Independence Day," Explosive science-action thriller is a whole lot of fun
","For over thousands years, mankind has been hit with a powerfully intriguing question: Are we alone, or is there life on other planets. Scientists to do this day still continue to investigate whether extraterrestrial life is existent on other planets or has visited our planet when we didn't know it. This sci-fi action thriller formulates an obvious fictional account of mankind's fight for survival against the large army of aliens who are set to invade Earth. The concept isn't terribly new as we experienced it before in H.G. Wells' War of The World's, but it's not say the film doesn't succeed on its own merits. Showering us with a wide plethora of eye-popping special effects and CGI, director Roland Emmerich blasts the screen with an high-octane action flick swarming with pulse-pounding action sequences and pure charisma, resulting in what was called in 1996 'the biggest movie of the summer'. The film opens up in July 2nd when communication systems are mysteriously failing from strange signals picking up outside the atmosphere. When the U.S military discover what appears to be meteors set to collide into Earth, they discover these strange objects are nothing other than gigantic spaceships run by aliens who appear to be here for a warm welcome. Soon, ex-scientist David Levinson (played by Jefd Goldblum) learn of their plot to invade our home planet when the aliens launch an attack on major cities including Washington D.C., New York City, and Los Angeles; resulting in the death of millions. With the future of the human race dangling, United States President Thomas Whitmore (played by Bill Pullman) on July 3rd, orders a large scale attack against the alien army with cocky Air Force pilot Captain Steven Hiller (played by Will Smith) leading the operation in attempt to save mankind. This big-budget action flick isn't highly original, nor does it leave a landmark on science- fiction genre. But it's hard to deny what a hell of a thrill ride it is, even if it's not a highly intelligent concept. From the opening minutes of the alien invasion, we are introduced to the startling, yet chord-striking shots of landmarks such as the White House, the Empire State Building, and other major downtown areas as they're obliterated into fiery explosions in front of a massive crowd of spectators. From that point, we know are in an intense ride. When it comes special effects, director Roland Emmerich doesn't play around. He embraces his beauty in jaw-dropping effects, and the air battle scenes involving Air Force pilots against the small alien spaceships make fine evidence of this. Though these scenes appear to borrow elements from other sci-fi classics like 'Star Wars' or 'Close Encounters of The Third Kind', there is plenty of excitement to be endured, including some funny (and occasionally no-brainer) one-liners uttered by the characters and the sheer likability of Will Smith playing a cocky pilot who embraces his commitment in active combat while maintaining an appropriately comedic attitude. If there is any flaw sustained in during the near 2 1/2 hour runtime, it probably comes from the shortage of properly developed characters as the mass array of action clouds over the character development, though the plot stands surprisingly stable throughout. In the end, we can't help but hope of these characters survival and success on their mission to save mankind from extermination. Independence Day is an exciting science-fiction popcorn thriller with dazzling special effects and decent, if slightly cheesy performances. This film isn't exactly what I consider a classic nor influential. Overall, it is a solidly entertaining and leaves a good note on Roland Emmerich's resume. Due to the amazing quality of the film, it makes me excited for the sequel 'Indepedence Day: Resurgence' which is set to hit theaters this weekend.",8,0,0,24 June 2016
No Country for Old Men," The Coen Brothers' nihilistic western thriller inspired on Cormac McCarthy's novel is pure cinematic beauty
","Life in west is violent, at least that is what many cinematic entries in the western genre lead you to believe. Hollywood moguls Joel and Ethan Coen take on the audacious of taking the pages of Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name and spinning it into cinematic proportions. It is significantly difficult feat to pull as McCarthy's sophisticated style of writing have lead many to believe translating his works into films are far too easier said than done. In spite of this, it appears that no one's directing methodology is a suitable match of McCarthy's writing other than the Coen Brothers. In a splendid effort, the masterminds behind such projects as 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski', and their debut 'Blood Simple' bring McCarthy's western tale to life in an pure enthralling fashion. It is violent, gory, and unquestionably dark in tone. But beneath the surface is immersive talent of the Coen Brothers who more than effectively uproot a tale of fate, conscious, and perplexing morality. Set in 1980, this film follows Southern Texas native Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin), a retired Vietnam veteran who goes on a hunting trip only to come across a string of dead bodies in what appears to have been a drug deal gone awry. Upon investigating the gruesome scene, he gets a hold of a suitcase containing a few million dollars. While Llewelyn manages to run away with it in attempt to make it to the Texas border, a sadistic sociopath Anton Chigurh (played by Javier Bardem) sets out to retrieve it, leading to a series of grisly murders. Meanwhile, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) goes the run to investigate the increasing body count.If the violence and bloodshed don't serve as a detriment to sitting through this two-hour work of art, then you are in for beautiful ride. After all, it is the Coen Brothers behind the wheel of this cinematic endeavor. Continuing on their signature methodology of mixing violence with darky, wry humor and eccentric characters, the Coens bring a masterful sleight of hand in operating the story of a bloody cat-and-mouse game where the fate of each character is unpredictable. The biggest show stealer here is Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh, a nihilistic, violence-hungry mastermind who becomes the driving force behind the briskly paced plot. He is a man with a complex sense of morality and shows little to no mercy on anyone who crosses his path. Each second he shows up on screen, things get very suspenseful within the blink of an eye. Coming face-to-face with each individual, Chigurh has a questionable of determining their fate, and that is flipping a corn and ordering them to guess it. If the Coens prove anything, one of them is that sometimes silence can be more nerve-racking than the presence of suspenseful music. And the best part is that the film does not need an eerie music score to portray its suspense. The dialogue and Bardem's unforgettable delivery firmly gets the job done. If you find yourself laughing, the chances are it is an uncomfortable one. (And let's not forget Roger Deakins's admirable camera-work put into the mix) As for Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones, both manage to give some decent performances, the latter of whom adds a sense of dark humor to the atmosphere with his sharp dialogue. Woody Harrellson plays a small role and does a fine job, but his time on screen is rather short. Kelly MacDonald, a Scottish actress showing off with her nifty Southern accent, gives a nice portrayal as the lead character's wife. Again not too much screen time. No Country for Old Men is violent, yet masterfully crafted western thriller uprooted by the directorial talent of the Coen Brothers. It is an astounding cinematic gem that proves why the Coens are such a respected filmmaking duo. At best, it stands in the front ranks of cinematic entries of the modern western genre. As for Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones; these three deserve a round of applause.",10,3,3,25 June 2017
District 9," District 9 is modern science-fiction masterpiece
","In his directorial debut, Neill Bloomkamp grips audiences with pure realism, and themes of racism, poverty, and dystopianism; and takes it in a whole another direction with this gritty and powerful science-fiction masterpiece. Partially shot in documentary style (not in a found-footage kinda way), this movie takes a place in a world where aliens have inhabited Earth, and are living in poverty as refugees in a shoddy village in an rural South African area enclosed by the military. Society has shown disapproval for the aliens' residence, and have ignited genocide and brutality against the aliens. Sharlto Copley plays government agent Wikus Van De Merew, who is exposed a hazardous alien chemical that causes him to transform into half- human, half-alien. With the military out to kill him, and his family distant from him; Wikus takes shelter at the village populated by the aliens, where he must defend himself and the aliens from the military. Neill Bloomkamp has a great visionary for storytelling and visual effects, and this film succeeds greatly at demonstrating it. This film mixes themes of racism and poverty, common issues that third- world countries face today, and adds a science-fiction touch to it. With the plot revolving around aliens growing up in a dystopian society and living in a slum-like villages where humans show hostility against the alien race, the film tackles many topics that would have viewers raising questions about society today. The first twenty minutes or so are quite distressing to watch as viewers are demonstrated how the aliens are harshly mistreated, and these scenes really set the tone of the film. Xenophobia also plays a major role in the plot as well. The military shows brutality against the aliens because they found them to be a threat to society, and do not feel safe in their residence. From there on, the film progresses through a fantastically written storyline. There is never a dull moment left here. The director just masters the film with an extraordinary script and expresses something original and thought-provoking. He handles the subject matter in such a dark and gritty manner, and knows how the keep the story alive for the entire time.The visual effects add greatly to the realism of the film. Prized with stellar visual effects and stunning cinematography, the battle scenes taking place during the final half-hour are eye-popping and entertaining to watch. The excessive violence, dismemberment and the gory-heavy results of the battles are enough to sicken some viewers; but those are tough enough to stomach the graphic aftermath of the scenes are in for a wild ride. Sharlto Copley shows off amazing acting in these scenes that, and feels so natural as his character. The overall quality of these scenes should very little, if any, sort of disappointment.District 9 shines as a modern science-fiction masterpiece of its decade, and is a pure demonstration of what director Neill Bloomkamp is capable of. This film is very powerful, realistic, and raises a lot of question for viewers to ask. District 9 is simply a must- watch film.",10,0,1,14 December 2015
Batman Begins," Batman Begins marks a brooding, yet satisfying portrayal of the DC comics's cape crusader
","When Tim Burton conquered the cape crusader with a darker approach to suit the atmosphere of the comics, it marked a definite start for the popularity of the comic book hero. But when Joel Schumacher took over the franchise marked the decline of Batman's reputation in the celluloid. Visionary director Christopher Nolan however, strikes the screen with an all-new examination of the cape crusader with a much darker and brooding approach in attempt to strike at the heart of the comics. Tackling on the origin story which follows the genesis of Bruce Wayne's venture into becoming the caped hero, Nolan and writer David S. Goyer grants the film with a portrayal of Batman that breathes new life into the hero's reputation in the Hollywood realm. And the new man stepping aboard the title role is Christian Bale who follows the footsteps of Michael Keaton to capture the brooding essence of the lead character with soul-crushing charisma. This film follows Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale), a man haunted by the murder of his parents at the hands of Carmine Falcone (played by Tom Wilkinson). Relocating from his mansion in Gotham watched over by his old guardian Alfred (played by Michael Caine), Bruce trains with the League of Shadows lead by his mentor Ducard (played by Liam Neeson) and Ra's Al Ghal (played by Ken Watanabe) to seek revenge against the slaying of his parents. When things get terrifying, Bruce relocates back to Gotham to support Wayne Industries, a company previously run by father. When he learns of sinister plan to wipe out Gotham with a toxic gas, Bruce adopts the identity of the hero known as Batman and must fight face-to-face against Dr. Jonathan Crane a.k.a. Scarecrow (played by Cillian Murphy), the mastermind behind this diabolical plot. In the process, he must form allies with Gotham Detective Jim Gordon (played by Gary Oldman).Christopher Nolan proves he knows the heart and spirit of the popular source material, as does writer David S. Goyer. His thoughtful direction on the driving the plot is not only consistent with breathing life into the titular hero, but a firmly engaging genesis of how Bruce Wayne rises above tyranny to become the cape crusader while fighting for his trust of the curious law enforcement. His method involves exploring the origins of Batman in areas the celluloid as yet to cover. Along the way, Nolan proves that superhero films do not have to all cheery and light- hearted to fuel the entertainment tank. What is the most important is that he keeps things interesting and intellectual challenging without sinking too deep into an overly serious atmosphere. The primary core of this superhero spectacle is the conflict between the ordinary man-turned hero and the dubious Dr. Jonathan Crane who is set Gotham of peacefulness with criminal Carmine Falcone at his assistance. Following a long proceeding of Bruce Wayne rise from zero to hero, the film buckles down to action with Batman taking on the baddies one step at a time, and the visually stunning action sequences that ensue are things of beauty. Nolan shows his grandeur in engaging filmgoers with an exhilarating visual heft, mostly in the production design, and cinematographer Wally Pfister excels at capturing the action with compellingly. Who can forget that train sequence during the climax? With Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney now ancestor of the central role, Christian Bale steps onboard in the role of the bat hero. For the versatile actor he is, he strongly embraces the role of the man inside and outside the batsuit, resulting in what is arguably the best portrayal of Batman in the celluloid, if not by Michael Keaton -- opinions will differ. Acting along his side is Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe as the leaders of League of Shadows, both of whom comply with performances that are solidly satisfying --nothing more, nothing less. English actor Michael Caine plays the role of Alfred, the guardian of Bruce who looks after hime following the untimely death of his parents, and he plays things decently as does Gary Oldman as Detective Jim Gordon. Tom Wilkinson is suitably menacing as the antagonist Carmine Falcone, the evil mastermind behind Bruce Wayne's emotional trauma from his childhood. Cillian Murphy works well in the other villain role as Dr. Jonathan Crane who sheds away him humanistic identity to step in as the ghastly Scarecrow who terrorizes the citizens of Gotham with his poisonous gas. Then there is Morgan Freeman, the prolific actor he is, playing Lucius Fox, the techno-genius who becomes a helping hand at putting Bruce into his hero costume. Sadly, Freeman himself is given little to do. He does at least make for a more interesting character than Katie Holmes's Rachel Dawes. While Holmes's performance is not bad, the writing of her character depraves her of any charisma, rendering her into a simple, flat character.Batman Begins is an entertaining superhero spectacle that marks a fresh start to the rebooted Batman franchise. It is visually compelling, appropriately brooding to carry its faith to the source material, and energizes the titular hero with stunning charisma thanks to Christopher Nolan behind the camera. In short words, it is a game changer.",8,1,1,19 July 2017
Bridesmaids," A clever and sincere comedy with heart and wit
","From the amazing producers of The 40-Year Old Virgin (2005), Knocked Up (2006), and Superbad (2007) comes a hilarious and clever romantic comedy about love and friendship. Kristin Wiig plays Anna, who thirty-something year old woman living in unhappy life after breaking up with her boyfriend. When her best friend Lillian (played by Maya Rudolph) announces she is getting married and asks her to be her maid of honor, Anna is determined to make it the best days of her life before her wedding. Things however, don't quite go planned as Anna leads Lillian and her friends in a series of wild misfortunes. Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph's co-stars include Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, Ellie Kemper, Rebel Wilson, and Wendi McLendon-Covey.Like many Judd Apatow's comedies, Bridesmaids is a comedy filled with both heart and hilarity, but plenty of crude humor. While most of his films feature primarily male characters and focus on the friendship between them, this one features a large female cast and centers on the misadventures these women face while trying to prepare for a special day for their friend; and the cast is nothing short of fantastic. Melissa McCarthy brings the life to the party with her witty one- liners and insane hilarity. Unlike in the typical Apatow-fare, this film takes advantage of scatological humor aside from the vulgar sex-fueled gags. Normally this type of humor is a recipe for disaster in comedies, this film however, uses it in a way that it clever and funny without being overly gross or appalling; which is quite surprising mainly due to the fact this deals with female characters. A great example would be the scene in the bathroom at the dress store, a scene when you would react in disgust but laugh hysterically at the same time. Aside from the humor, the film also carries a heart-filling message about friendship and what it means to love someone. So the film does have its dramatic moments, but ultimately it meant to be funny and entertaining.Bridesmaids is so far one of the best comedies of this decade, and I am confident that this will go down as a classic in the next ten years. While this film is targeted towards women, guys will very likely get as much fun out of this as women.",8,0,0,13 August 2015
Non-Stop," Great 'edge of your seat' thriller
","Liam Neeson does a decent job in this action thriller of a man who takes a plane ride and receives threatening texts from an anonymous person demanding for $150 million or one of the passengers will die. He spends most of the film trying to find out who's the mysterious person is as much as we do. Throughout the movie, you keep trying to guess who the mysterious person is and it leaves you biting your nails.This movie is filled with constant suspense and keeps you at the edge of your seat. Liam Neeson as well as the other actors and actress show off such good performances that you can almost literally feel their emotions and the intensity. In my opinion, Neeson deserves an Oscar for his role or at least some type of award.One of the best action films of the year so far. 9/10",9,0,1,1 August 2014
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Tucker and Dale vs Evil is a wildly funny mix of blood, gore, and a surprising amount of heart
","Spending the weekend at the lake camping, drinking, and skinning dipping in the lake, what could possibly go wrong? A lot, unfortunately, as demonstrated in many horror entities such as 'Friday the 13th' and 'Cabin Fever'. When tackling on the horror genre, it seems that the lake house or a cabin in the woods is never a safe place of teenagers, young adults, or even grown man party at. This horror-comedy hybrid sets another example, only with a slightly smarter and heartfelt approach. You ever heard the phrase 'don't judge a book by its cover'? Well, this gore-filled comedy takes the inspiring concept and turns it right on his head with this genre- bending farce showcasing a hilarious conflict between a group of college kids and a duo of bearded country men who are just out for a weekend of fishing. Whereas the former are typically the good guys and the latter are usually the bad guys, this film makes a daring task to take that clichÃ©d and gives it a twist. This movie follows a group of college students who drive out to the country and spend their weekend at the lake, the same lake country hillbillies Tucker (played by Alan Dudyk) and Dale (played by Tyler Labine) happen to be camping at. Upon meeting them at a gas station, the gang immediately comes creeped out by them and flees. Later that night, at the lake, one of the girls Allison (played by Katrina Bowden) suffers a head injury and falls into the water. When Tucker and Dale drag her to their cabin to nurse her, her friends grow incredible suspicious (and judgemental) and wage war on the hillbillies. What ensues instead is a comical, but deadly turn for the worst. In today's age, too many people are top quick to judge for the appearance of others. The issue lies within the core of the plot here, which offers an absurd, yet hilarious testament on the consequences of misjudging others for what is seen on the outside than what is on the inside. And director Eli Craig is the mastermind behind reeling in this inspiring phenomenon with a funny, tongue-in- cheek twist. The movie follows a familiar clichÃ© with a young college age kids battling against some middle-aged country boys who they believe are just your average psychopaths hungry for blood, only both sides of the moral compass are swapped between the two groups. The film introduces the two eponymous characters as stereotypical southerners with big beards and lightly sets up their background, while leaving most of the college characters rendered in simple figures. From there on, it is not long before the story escalates into a gut-busting bloodbath, and that is where most of the laughs are perpetrated. When tension between the two sides rise, so does the body count, not because these kids make the stupid decisions known in slasher movies but simply because they are just too amateur to defend themselves without being overly clumsy. Like films such as 'Shaun of The Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz', the film uproots its goofy humor through an excess of blood and gore to showcase the violent, albeit hilarious deaths of the characters. And to fuel up the intellect tank, there is a smart message about thinking before you judge others upon first glance and learning to stand up for yourself, both of which are nicely offered in the midst of the carnage and laughter. Eli Craig proves he knows how to give a film a strong heart without neglecting his duty for reel in some good laughs. Not many comedies, particularly the ones mating with the horror genre, accomplish that feat. Tucker and Dale vs Evil is a wildly funny mix of blood, gore, and surprising amount of heart in the midst of its outrageous gruesome hilarity. It is a funny good time that proves movies can be uproot plenty of laughter through stupidity while flourishing an intellectual touch to the mix. Comedy fans will be satisfied, while gore lovers will be ecstatic.",8,0,0,1 August 2017
Revolutionary Road," Emotionally stimulating performances by Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet make this a rewarding domestic drama
","Revolutionary Road is an emotionally blistering drama that tackles on mature subjects such as infidelity, abortion, and the struggle of following life-long dreams. It is honest, it is poignant, and it offers somewhat uncomfortable message about the difficulties of marriage when desires are not reached. Director Sam Mendes is the leader of bringing about this potent domestic drama and reuniting 'Titanic' stars Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet as lovers. The romance between the two stars however, is slightly different story here. While the blockbuster film showcases the blossoming romance between Dicaprio and Winslet, this film goes the opposite route, and does so by tackling the sad, but significant issues that can leave marriage, or perhaps a whole family clinging on the edge of divorcement. With an intelligent direction by Mendes and profound performances by the two leads, this movie makes for a solid work of art. Set in the 1950s, the film revolves around Frank (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) and April Wheeler (played by Kate Winslet), a Connecticut couple who's marriage is in turmoil and are struggling to deal with personal issues. April is struggling as a theater actress and is stuck as housewife, and Frank is working a white- collar job that he desperately can't stand and is having an affair with his co-worker. When they make plans to move to Paris where both can fulfill their life-long dreams, they see what they believe to be the light at the end of the tunnel for their marriage. But can they overcome their personal obstacles including April's unexpected pregnancy to succeed their goals?This film does not aim to tug at your heart springs, but it does offer a heart-wrenching truth about the fragility of the family when a couple's marriage reaches a dark period, especially when considering how high America's divorce rate has skyrocket in the past six decades. The story explores the dynamics of our lead couple as they struggle to come to terms with the obstacles bar from achieving their desires. One of the major aspects the story tackles is the idea of feeling trapped in a world where life is barred with seemingly endless limitations. The problem between the Wheelers is not each other, but their struggle to find a satisfying life in the suburbs. When they make a plan to move the family to Paris, that is when they become touched with hope for their domestic dilemma. But as the story advances, it becomes more and more evident that achieving you dreams is not always as easy as it seems. This accounts to some emotionally jarring revelations. Although the film occasionally slips into the pitfalls of utter melodrama, it is brutally honest is portraying the atmosphere of a broken family. And the helping hands behind the emotional resonance is Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet who both showcase true grit and powerful sentimentality in their roles, not perhaps not on the line with the chemistry they showcased when they were lovers on a sinking ship. The lead couple is greatly supported by Kathy Bates who makes for a tremendous role as their mutual friend who provides comfort in the dark days of their marriage. Revolutionary Road is a powerful domestic drama sparkling with riveting performances and an solid direction by Sam Mendes who embraces the material with strong intellect. This is certainly not a happy ride nor does it opens doors to much humor beyond the arresting melodrama, but that is a rewarding piece of work.",8,0,0,17 April 2017
It Follows," A scary, clever ignition of the horror genre
","After the a long series of horror films that failed to leave a lasting impression on the horror genre, it comes almost explicitly clear that the horror genre is running scarce of ideas. Thus, the genre is found lost in the sea of old, tiresome clichés that have long overstayed their welcome. This is until director David Robert Mitchell steps in the game to deliver this psychological horror-thriller sparked with one of the most original ideas of the genre brought in recent memory. Devoid of nearly every overused trope including terrorizing paranormal entities, masked killers wielding a bladed weapon, and flesh-eating zombies, this movie formulates an all-new original concept that some can interpret as an allegory of the AIDS epidemic that went viral in the 1980s, a deadly virus transmitted to teenagers through engagement of sexual activity and renders them into a dangerous life-threatening situation. With little works under his belt other than the 2011 coming-of-age drama 'The Myth of The American Sleepover', David Robert Mitchell takes the director's chair in this horror flick starring Maika Monroe as Jay, a young college girl who goes out on a date with her boyfriend Hugh (played by Jake Weary) which leads to intimate sexual encounter. Soon, when Jay becomes experiencing some terrifying hallucinations, she learns her life in mortal danger. Her escape from the dreadful virus is to pass over the virus to another individual via sexual intercourse.David Robert Mitchell succeeds in energizes this film with not only generating all-new concept but also executing it in an effective manner. This task involves taking the typical 'only virgins survive' trope common in the slasher genre (Halloween, Scream for example) and expanding upon it. Rather pounding the audience with constant sight scares and jump scenes, the film conveys it's scare factor by building up it's dark, eerie atmosphere through slick character development and the revolving fear of the characters battling against the horrors of this sexually transmitted virus. Though the plot's slow pace can be frustrating for the impatient viewers, Mitchell succeeds on making the concept work. But the scares are the only the film's high caliber. The movie was filmed on location in an old tranquil neighborhood in Detroit and uses vintage synthesized music score common by Disaster Peace that pay effective homages to the horror classics from the 70s and 80s. As a result, viewers are presented with what feels like a retro horror flick. The music score succeeds on only obtaining a retro feel for the film but also constructing it's true eerie atmosphere. Aside from all this, the cast shows off some great performances, particularly Maika Monroe as the steamy scream queen serving the center role in the story. Are the performances very memorable? Not really, but certainly work.It Follows is a fresh, stunning addition to the horror genre that introduces a fresh new idea to the category with fresh performances, spectacular direction by David Robert Mitchell, and an overall solid execution of a newborn concept. The chances of this becoming a horror classic are hard to say at this point but it is definitely a must-watch for all horror fans looking for something new.",9,11,18,26 July 2016
City of God," Extremely somber and violent, but overall incredibly riveting
","Not many crime films come as dark, gritty, or even violent as this one. And unlike most crime stories set in America, this film paints a brutally honest picture of the harrowing lifestyle that dictates the third-world country of Brazil. With the visceral direction by Fernando Merielles and Katia Lund, viewers are dragged into a grueling but significantly honest experience of the difficulties in growing up in a world where violence and crime is practically a way of life than an obstacle in society. Set in the 1960s and 1970s, the film takes place in Rio De Janeiro which most people refer to as City of God, a poverty-ridden city in Brazil where employment is very low, the crime rate is devastatingly high and just about everyone from young elementary-school age children to adults carry a gun. Those are not employed resort to robbery and murder for financial support. Enter Rocket (played by Alexandre Rodrigues), a young boy growing up in the violent slums of Rio De Janeiro with the dreams of becoming of a photographer but finds his future obscured by the everyday crime including the robbery and homicide by his brother Goose (played by Renato De Souza) and his gang. Competing with his gang is Lil Ze (played by Leandro Firmino), a young boy with a thirst of violence who grows up to work his up the crime ladder to become the leader of the most dangerous gang in Rio De Janeiro. As these two gangs cross paths, the result is a war that spirals gravely out of control.This film is in no means fun to watch, it is extremely violent, brutally somber, and at times incredibly difficult to sit through. But the most earnest quality here is: it's authentic. While most crime films deal with characters getting involved outside the law to achieve something of their desires, this film tackles crime as a natural societal lifestyle simply because it takes place in a town in Brazil where violent crime is a composition of their society. And it doesn't try to glorify violence but to show the inhuman consequences that result in such heinous activity. Whenever a character, major and minor, is killed you can't help but feel deeply for the character, and the emotional resonance delivered in these scenes never feel forced. As the story moves, you watch as the main character develop from a boy struggling from moral ambiguity and the overwhelming influence of his fellow friends who rely on firearms to squeeze their way out of unwanted situations, to a young man who begins to realize the damage it causes him and roots for a better future. The outcome is one powerful character granted by an ingenious performance by Alexandre Rodrigues. The most compelling feature of this character however, comes from his conflict with Lil Ze and his gang. Leandro Firmino gives a intriguing performance as Lil Ze, a sociopathic young man wrapped in his own bloodlust since childhood and with no desire other than to be the most feared man in town. If you are not disturbed by flashbacks of him as a little boy shooting a man and woman while laughing like a child watching a clown at birthday party or a youngster forced to shoot a little kid in the foot, I don't know what will. The conflict that embroils between him and the main character Rocket provides a visceral tension that moves the story very well while paying plenty of emotional investment. City of God is a deeply riveting drama that leaves a powerful impact very few can deny. This is a film punctuated with astounding performances, solid writing, and an ultimately uncompromising direction. It is disappointing that this film was overlooked for an Oscar for Best Picture nomination, though it is likely due to the grim material. The film is worth watching but perhaps not one you'll want again after first viewing due to the dark atmosphere and overall brutality.",9,2,4,31 May 2016
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," This masterful martial arts epic is no ordinary thrill ride, it's a hallmark of the martial genre
","In the mysterious world of foreign cinema, there are many films that glamorize not only jaw-dropping taste of the Hollywood industry, but also the incredible cinematic feats directors in international countries have brought all around the globe. This masterful martial arts epic directed by Taiwanese director Ang Lee stands out as not only one of the most thrilling cinematic projects of its genre, but also one of the most unique ever brought to American Hollywood from overseas. In short words, it's a masterpiece of epic proportions. Exploring the extravagant historical period of Ancient China while driving a mix of electrifying martial arts action sequences and sweeping drama, this is a rare film that shatters the boundaries of the martial arts genre. Set in China somewhere in the 1800s during the Qing Dynasty, this film follows the story of two martial arts warriors, one of them is Li Mu Bai (played by Chow-Yun Fat); a young man aching to retire of fighting but continues on in pursuit of vengeance against Jade Fox (played by Cheng Pei-pei), the woman responsible for the death of his master. The other Yu Shi Lien (played by Michelle Yeoh), a woman struggling to establish her feeling for Mu Bai as well as being the bodyguard for young teenager girl Jen Yu (played by Zhang Ziyi) who is desperate to escape from the confinement of her home to independence. When a precious sword known as the 'Green Destiny' is stolen, this places Shi Lien and Mu Bai on a heart-racing showdown against the person responsible for the priceless weapon.If director Ang Lee proves anything crucial, it is that he has an incredible gift of balancing pulse-pounding martial arts action sequences and a compelling epic story; a task even some of the most ambitious struggle to pull off nowadays. In shocking efforts, Ang Lee manages to pull this off in ways that is truly phenomenal. Unsurprisingly, the biggest attention grabber here is of course, the martial arts action sequences where audiences sit back and watch our characters engage an exhilarating martial arts fist fighting and frenetic swordplay. What makes these action scenes really stand out aside from the hefty cinematography by Peter Pau is the eye-popping choreography the boost the ferocity of the sword-to-sword (and hand-to-hand) combat. If these sequences feel reminiscent to the martial arts combat in the sci-thriller 'The Matrix', that is because the choreography is orchestrated by Yuen Wo Ping who collaborated with The Wachowksis to conduct the fight choreography in The Matrix as well. Only in this film, the fight sequences are even more impressive and poetic than we saw Neo engaging in the brutal hand-to-hand brawl against Mr. Smith, especially when considering the lengthy takedown sequence into the restaurant.For a filmmaker like Ang Lee, it is only expected that he expands the film's stylish grandeur with not only the nifty production design to present an authentic setting of 19th century China, but also a solidly written story to drive the film's substance. Fortunately, this film blesses filmgoers with an astounding narrative heft that not only feels original but spawns plenty of emotional arrest. The masterminds by this feat is writers Wang Hui-Long, James Schamus, and Tsai Kuo Jong who have the blissful taste of powerful characterization and vibrant storytelling. The writers tap into to themes of relationships, love, and betrayal; and use them as coherent building blocks to form an awe-inspiring story along with some stellar characters. Yu Shi Lien and Li Mu Bai who are portrayed gracefully by Michelle Yeoh and Chow-Yun Fat respectively make for some intriguing, heroic characters with both humanity and adrenaline-fueled testosterone (mostly in the action sequences). But by far the biggest show stealer in the bunch is the indulgent Jen Yu who is empowered with a riveting performance by Zhang Ziyi. Jen spawns to life as a mysterious character wired with powerful emotional complexity that drives the emotional atmosphere of each scene until the very end of the film. Whenever this characters come on screen, she immediately grabs a hold of our eyes and never lets go.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a masterful martial arts epic empowered by a sweeping narrative heft and exhilarating martial arts action, and blossoms into a explosively entertaining experience. At best, it is an electrifying piece of foreign cinema that places Ang Lee in the high ranks of Hollywood filmmakers. To say the least, the film is a an eye-dazzling masterpiece.",10,0,0,14 December 2016
Beasts of No Nation," Very powerful and moving Netflix original
","This low-budget war drama that sadly failed to make a wide release in theaters, but gladly managed to stream on Netflix, stars Abraham Attah as Agu, a young child growing up in an unnamed third-world, country in West Africa. When his town is brutally attacked an African militia and his mother and brother are killed, he finds himself pulled into an army of child soldiers by a Commander (played by Idris Elba). Striking through the war-ravaged country, Agu and his fellow comrades experience the horrific realities of war. Directed by Cary Joji Fukanuga, this movie boasts an extraordinary storytelling, vibrant performances, and an ambitious direction.As this film is partially based on true events, it tackles some interesting issues dealing with poverty and genocide. During the first ten minutes, we are introduced the main character Agu and his friends who try selling a TV with no screen and make playful action through the 'imaginary' screen to fill people who watch it with imagination, I thought that was kinda cute. We then see Agu and other children in school in classrooms that easily resembles an abandoned garage. These scenes accurately portray the everyday society that citizens in African territory face. The plot takes off when the African militia arrives in town and launches assault and began kidnapping and killing hundreds of civilians in the eyes of young Agu. Hiding in the woods on the outskirts in his small town, he is found by the Commander of other children who are now trained soldiers and joins the team to fight as a soldier against the militia that kill his family and destroyed his home. From there on, the audience is treated with a gritty and harrowing atmosphere of war as these kids forced to fight for their lives and their poor country. The film does get undeniably bleak and violent , and is quite difficult to watch, but at the same time still manages to keep you glued to your seats. The film moves very well, even though there are some really slow moments, and this is all thanks to the brilliantly written screenplay by director Cary Fukanuga. Abraham Attah gives a wonderful performance as the main child, and Idris Elba shows a fair amount of charisma in his role. Beasts of No Nation is one of the most vibrant and moving films of the year and definitely deserves some awards. However, due to its online release and short marketing, this film may have reduced its chance of being found under the Oscar radar, and is certainly making very very little at the box office because of it. Overall, this film is very powerful and a good choice for subscribers on Netflix.",10,3,5,25 October 2015
Gone Girl," Strong and riveting thriller with a twist
","Ben Affleck has been a great actor in recent years and I was glad to see him in this movie. Gone Girl was an intense, powerful but engaging movie that leaves you breathless at times. The movie however is not perfect or even near perfect, it has its flaws. At various points, the movie was very monotoned and moved as slow as a snail. There are also a few questions that are left unanswered, mainly dealing with the character Amy and her motives. Then there were several scenes that didn't seem relevant to the plot. On the other hand, the movie had some positive factors.Ben Affleck's acting was pretty great, the best of his performances I've seen since Good Will Hunting. Rosamund Pike's performance was pretty good too. However, the best aspect of the movie was not the performances but the plot twists. Around halfway through the film, you learn shocking truths about some of the characters that would make your jaw drop. If you ask me, I was caught off guard by some of these characters. I couldn't tell whether they were innocent or bad but thats the beauty of the characters.Now I've never read the book so I don't know how good the book is compared to the movie. Overall, the movie is very worth watching, especially if you are a Ben Affleck fan.",8,3,7,18 February 2015
Django Unchained," Wildly entertaining western masterpiece by Quentin Tarantino
","It's not hard to say Quentin Tarantino has been one of Hollywood's most respected directors in Hollywood since his first outing in 1992 with 'Reservoir Dogs', the violent crime-drama that placed this filmmaker in the cinematic spotlight prior to his magnum opus 'Pulp Fiction'. His signature use of innovative storytelling, sharp dialogue, and inventive parodying of classic Hollywood subgenres have driven him to being one of the most unique filmmakers working today. He's took an idiosyncratic twist on World War II on the German front in 2009's revenge fantasy 'Inglourious Basterds' as well as a stylish spin on the martial arts genre in 'Kill Bill' and it's sequel. Tarantino takes on the western genre in Django Unchained, a revisionist western film set in the Deep South that explores an audacious, yet darkly funny spin on the harrowing period of slavery during the Pre-Civil War era. Set in the 1850s, Jamie Foxx plays Django Freeman, an African American prisoner who is freed from slavery by a German bounty hunter and former dentist, Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz). The two embark on a journey across the South to Mississippi to save Django's wife Broomhilda (played by Kerry Washington), who is being held in slavery by sadistic plantation owner Calvin Candie (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) who has the loyalties from his trustful slave Stephen (played by Samuel L. Jackson). Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino doesn't go for the typical somber tone that often suites the atmosphere of dark historical fiction, particularly the entries dealing with slavery. Instead, he flourishes the story in the tongue-in-cheek fashion that sees the plot balancing between darkly funny and political inaccuracy. Most of this comes down to a plot following Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz, both of whom exhibit some sincere performances, on a solidly pace trek through the racism-ridden south that unsurprisingly for the Tarantino fare, turns into an overblown bloodbath. Aside from this, Tarantino grants his characters with sharp dialogue and gleefully dark humor that while has the capacity to provoke chuckles, often borders on the line between smart and exploitative. The same can easily to said about his use of graphic violence that erupts towards the film's final act. At the same time, Tarantino has the hefty hand to make it entertaining, if unapologetically insolent. The star that steals the biggest spotlight is the ever-popular Leonardo Dicaprio who deprives against his usual good guy image to portray a ruthless slave owner who gets trigger happy with dropping with N-word, forces slaves to engage in a gruesome wrestling match that makes the fist fights in 'Fight Club' look tame by comparison, and and pervades with an all-out racist attitude. His portrayal is bit edgy even for the darkly comedic territory, but it marks a definite high point for him in a trophy case of Oscar-caliber performances. Frequent Tarantino collaborator Samuel L. Jackson also shines in his irreverently fuuny role as Dicaprio's loyal servant, though largely unrecognizable with his heavy make-up used to give in an appearance of an old man making him only distinguishable by his signature voice. Django Unchained is a masterpiece! It shows a clear example that Quentin Tarantino is fantastic on taking on the western genre. However, this is quite bold and relentless on its political incorrectness making not for a solid choice for the faint of heart. Like most films about Tarantino, there is plenty of graphic violence and profanity, but if you're a big Tarantino, it should come to no surprise.",9,0,2,14 June 2015
Get Out," Jordan Peele's gutsy comedy-horror hybrid is not just entertaining, it is surprisingly smart in its daring satire
","Get Out is a combination of a comedy and a horror, but it certainly isn't your average horror-comedy hybrid. It is one that makes a daunting achievement of not only evenly balancing laughs with a grim tone, but providing a fascinatingly unique examination on racism, an issue that is overwhelmingly relative in our society today. There are gut-busting laughs, there are some dark moments, and are even some scenes of gore. But above these components is an intelligent, yet bizarre allegory of the African-American community falling victim to racial prejudice among a society where racism has run rampant. The mastermind behind this treat is Jordan Peele, the sketch comedic star fresh from Comedy Central's 'Key and Peele' and taking the seat in his directorial debut. With a blend of vulgar humor and gags centered on racial stereotypes, Peele's comedic flair definitely bleeds through. This film focuses on Chris Washington (played by Daniel Kaluuya), a twenty-something year old African- American man who sets out to spend the weekend with his Caucasian girlfriend Rose Armitage (played by Allison Williams) at her parents' house. Upon meeting her parents (played by Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) for the first time, Chris quickly begins to witness some strange behavior among the family including relatives and their house maid Georgina (played by Betty Gabriel) who happens to African-American. This leads to one major conclusion: something is not about this family. It is significantly rare that directors successfully pull off an congruent balance of outrageous laughter and spine-chilling scares, let alone splicing smart social commentary on racial prejudice. Jordan Peele manages to hit that note in nearly every way possible to the point where there is never a dull moment. The film spends the first half showcasing the paranoia of the lead character's uncomfortable situation including calm interactions with his girlfriend's family that quickly morph into awkward circumstances. Throughout the time, Peele does a tremendous job at breathing suspense into the atmosphere that viewers feeling off-kilter and questioning what on Earth is happening around the lead character and what the characters are thinking about the lead character being colored skin and dating a white female. In turn of satirizing the subject matter, the film does so by providing witty social commentary about the African-American stereotypes rather than being going the obvious route by preaching about racial bigotry. Along the way, there is more than a handful of laughs to be offered, most of which come from the lead character's best friend played by LilRel Howery who spends most of the time away from the chaos. It is not until the final half-hour however, when the film escalates into a gory and unnerving fiasco, challenging viewers' expectations upon every turn. While the ending does not the strike a chord in the surprise department, Peele never fails to defy against uniformity nor does slap viewers in the face with his political message. Get Out is an entertaining, audacious, and surprisingly brainy horror-comedy that not only showcases Jordan Peele's unexpected directorial talent, but opens the door to an outrageous fun, yet bizarre good time. Marking this film as cinematic gold for both the comedy and horror genre may be saying a lot. At the same time, it wouldn't be too unreasonable, especially as no Hollywood director has a made a more daring comedic endeavor such a long time.",9,9,17,28 May 2017
Drive," Stylish art-house thriller is very violent, but beautifully crafted and solidly entertaining
","Drive is certainly no ordinary crime thriller with guns blazing and cars flying down the streets, it is a neo-noir thriller that proves you can make a visually mesmerizing vehicle of a film with such a less than inspiring plot. It sports vastly engrossing performances by an charismatic cast, a solidly competent screenplay based on a novel by James Sallis, an artful depiction of violence, and an alluring soundtrack to sit the ambient tone of it's dark revenge plot; and these aspects are safely guided by director Nicolas Winding Refn who clearly carries a unique vision. From the opening scene to the closing, it is clear that Refn is clearing aiming for a style-over-substance vibe as the film falls slightly seldom of narrative originality, while paying homages to classic crime flicks from the early days. But if this film proves anything, it is that Refn is capable of competently modernizing a progressively fading subgenre from the early age of Hollywood. This film stars Ryan Gosling as unnamed Los Angeles native who works part-time as a mechanic for auto salesman Shannon (played by Bryan Cranston), part-time as a Hollywood stunt driver while moonlighting a getaway driver during the night hours. Upon residing into his new apartment, he meets hot-shot blondie named Irene (played by Carey Mulligan) who's stuck taking of her seven-year old son Benicio alone while her husband Standard Gabriel (played by Oscar Isaac) is serving time in prison. Upon his release, Standard is back home and has reunited with his family. But he still owes several thousand dollars to gangsters Bernie Rose (played by Albert Brooks) and Nino (played by Ron Perlman). When a bank robbery attempt goes horribly wrong, Ryan Gosling must seek for justice against the vicious mobsters.Nicolas Winding Refn isn't the strongest filmmaker when it comes to pedaling on an awe-inspiring story. But upon revitalizing the genre in an art-house fashion, Refn hits nearly all the right notes. Mixing elements of romance, action, corruption, and melancholy; Refn operates this movie with a stylish cinematic grandeur that makes it feel almost original even when it's not. In short, it makes an entertaining, if leisurely ride. Ryan Gosling steps into the foots of the unnamed protagonist who works as a mechanic, a stunt driver, as well as a getaway driver for criminals in the midst of robberies. Although little information is handed from his character, the opening scene featuring recklessly speeding through the streets of Los Angeles with a duo of robbers hunched in the backseat implies he has a shady past. And the story unfolds, the film slowly dissects the character's layers to score for a powerfully mysterious character with inner demons. When it comes down to facing off against the baddies in a vicious bloodbath, the film proceeds with a hypnotic tone supplemented with an ambient music score by Cliff Martinez that results is in a slow pace which is enough to turn off viewers who root for a more solidly moving storyline. Those rooting for a solid proceeding will be reasonably frustrated while others will be riveted by Refn's sweeping style along with the alluring electronic 80s-like soundtrack. The sporadic (and startling) burst of graphic violence that sprout out of nowhere many times throughout the second half can make this an uncomfortable sit through on the other hand, unless you are capable of stomaching gory carnage.Ryan Gosling embraces a fascinating portrayal of the nameless protagonist elicits a very limited range of dialogue. In this case, he relies his performance vastly on his facial expressions over verbal communication bring out the emotions of his mysterious character. In shorts words, it's almost haunting. Although his character is understandably questionable in terms of his mean of justice, there is no denying that Gosling effectively channels for a role further from his usual nice guy typecasting. His chemistry with his blond neighbor played by Carey Mulligan is deeply moving for the time they spend on screen together, though arguably the bigger aspect of their bond is formed by the camaraderie between him and her young son Benicio who looks at him as a friendly figure. Oscar Isaac makes a competent (and likable) presence for all time he shares on screen. On the dark side of the moral compass is Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman who both turn in sinister portrayal as a duo of mobsters consumed with greed and violent tendencies, while cashing in a few pinches of humor. In fair results, these two decently sell themselves to their antagonistic roles. Bryan Cranston plays his role pretty safely, but perhaps nothing out of ordinary.Drive is a stylish art-house thriller polished by an inspiring direction by Nicolas Winding Refn, striking visual heft, and an enthralling array of performances by an A-list cast. In short words, it is an entertaining ride for those who can swallow Refn's unique style of filmmaking. It is dark, it is slow, and it is extremely violent to hence it's R-rating. But most importantly, it demonstrates Nicolas Winding Refn operating on an admirable cinematic grandeur.",8,0,0,20 January 2017
Ghost Rider," Nicolas Cage has the charisma of the titular hero, but it's not enough make up for its generic script
","Releases of superhero movies based on Marvel comics are more often than not subject to the most attention of their year from the public, while also scoring abundantly high on the box office ladder. Majority of the time, these films are intended for make for some high-octane entertainment; even when centering on the arguably lesser known comic book heroes like Ghost Rider here. Occasionally, the superhero genre from both the DC side and the Marvel Comics side has the tendency of slipping into the crack of some mediocre attempts bring some comic books on the silver screen. Ghost Rider, directed by Mark Steven Johnson, is one of those films. Though it certainly not one of the worst the genre has to offer especially when considering some of the more horrendous entries such as 'Catwoman', this film fails to succeed beyond the level of disposable entertainment. Based on the marvel comics, this film stars Nicolas Cage as Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stuntman who suffers from emotional trauma after the tragic death of his father (played by Brett Cullen) as a teenager. He learns the death of his father was a result of when he mistakenly sold his soul to the devil known as Mephistopheles (played by Peter Fonda). Not only that, he gains the powers of the devil that turn him into a fiery monster with a skull scorching in flames. When his son known as Blackheart (played by Wes Bentley) threatens to release demons from hell to take over the Earth, Blaze must use his newly gained powers to fight back while protecting his childhood crush Roxanne (played by Eva Mendes).This superhero action flick isn't a total drab to say at best. Those who go in for some action sequences tapped with fine visual effects will have at least something to hurrah for. The action kicks in our titular hero ramping up in flames as his humanistic body morphs into a skeleton body with his head transforming into a skull bursting into CGI flames. What transpires then is the hero racing at high speed on his devilish-looking motorcycle and facing off the bad guys in some chain-whipping action. Beyond this, the film fails to deliver much palpable excitement. The plot is a bit generic as it deals with the conflict between our titular hero and a hellish villain known as Blackheart also known as Legion. While Nicolas Cage generates a fair amount of charisma to make for a hero for audiences to root for, Wes Bently's performance fails to amount of an interesting or even memorable villain. Though he is not expected to fall on the lines of more highly iconic villains like The Joker or Magneto, his lack of ingenuity is rather hard to overcome. The conflict between the two characters eventually comes down to a final showdown sequences that should have been fun, but criminally lack the adrenaline it needs to be a climatic action farce. Then there is Eva Mendes who is given almost nothing to do beyond playing the corny love interest of Nicolas Cage. Though her performance is at least on the par, the chemistry between her and Cage never quite sizzles.Ghost Rider is a generic superhero action flick that fails to rise above the typical standards of an average Marvel comics blockbuster. Although this film may demonstrate a glimmer of fun in its tense action sequences and small dosage of humor, the overall entertainment value leads little to be desired even for die hard comic book fanatics.",4,0,0,12 December 2016
Room," A breathtaking journey through one of the most haunting stories of recent years
","This indie drama directed by Lenny Abrahamson is a movie with not enough words to describe how breathtaking it is from beginning to end. Based on the captivating novel by Emma Donoghue, this indie flick rounds up a gripping testament of one of the most powerful bonds between a little boy and his mother ever told on screen. And with an awe-inspiring direction by Lenny Abrahamson and lively storytelling that holds the effects of making you cheer with utter joy at one moment, then leaving you reaching for the tissues the next; and by the end when the credits start rolling, it's difficult to leave the film without garnering a feeling of haunt, or imagining how it would feel to step in the shoes of the characters as they face an near-imaginable predicament. This film follows of the story of twenty-something year old Joy (played by Brie Larson) and her five-year old son Jack (played by Jacob Tremblay) who have spent many years incarcerated in a small shed by Joy's abusive lover who she calls Old Nick (played by Sean Bridgers) who's only means of support is bringing them food and water; while keeping them locked up in the shed using a number combination only he knows. Spending his five young years cooped up in the small shed crammed with a twin-sized bed and a sink, Jack has absolutely no knowledge of the outside world; he makes friends with inanimate objects including a wardrobe and a sink, he believes people on television are just characters made of abstract colors. This is until one day when him and Joy finally make their escape, they go out where Jack experiences the outside world for the very first time.The film introduces an idea that may lay some familiarity on some film goers, an idea of innocent souls held captive in a small enclosed area and alienated with society for many years which you may have heard in some news articles dating back to the Baby Boom era. Lenny Abrahamson however, executes this concept in a way that not only breathtaking, but simply magical. Abrahamson takes the harrowing story of a mother and her little boy enclosed in tiny, old world free from society, successfully captures the deep emotional atmosphere surrounding the lead characters and conducts the story in a way that feels incredibly realistic as if you are actually another character trapped in the small room. Just about every scene taking place inside the small room is beautifully shot with decent lighting to make sure you are able to capture the intense feeling of the characters and their interaction with the small place outside the world the little boy believes is imaginary made up by his mother. When the little boy finally reaches his chance of examining the outside world for the first time, it fuels the emotional core of the story, even more so than the relationship between him and his mother which serves as a key figure of the film. And the emotional gravity continues as the two are forced to adjust to their new life outside, with plenty of moments to allow our characters to shine, and never feeling the need to manipulate us with sappy storytelling. Brie Larson gives a performance that is simply phenomenal and bound to pull at the heart strings. Jacob Tremblay who's only eight years old playing a five-year old child is also tremendous in his role, especially for a cute kid his age. Sean Bridgers, though not given too much do, makes a good source for some intense, heart-pounding moments during the first half. The rest of the cast including William H. Macy and Joan Allen are simply mesmerizing, though fall short below the gold of the two main leads.Room is riveting, triumphant journey through one of the most stories ever told on film in years. With unforgettable performances and lively storytelling, this film is one piece of cinematic artwork that is definitely too breathtaking to ignore. Yes, it can be tough watch at times and there are moments are destined to scouting for tissues or crying on the shoulder of your friend next to you. But ultimately, the film is a rewarding experience.",10,1,2,29 September 2016
The Mist," Frank Darabont's The Mist is terrifying, visceral cinematic tale based on the works by Stephen King
","Stephen King has been held as the master of horror in the world of literacy. Love or hate him, there is no doubt that his works have left an impact on both writers and filmmakers everywhere. This horror novel 'The Mist' is the subject of this terrifying sci- fi/horror endeavor, and is operated by the hands of Frank Darabont who helmed the American classic 'Shawshank Redemption, another film based on King's works. Like Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining' (which King was disappointed with) this film sees Darabont taking liberties from King's acclaimed source material and using it for appealing cinematic horror advantages. His solid direction more than works, it excels the film into a thought-provoking, frightening experience that will hold no bars on haunting viewers long after the end credits roll. Even those with a strong muscle against the spookiest cinematic pictures will find themselves curling into a fetal position. The story has not a married man descending into mental insanity and wielding an axe, it is something shockingly more terrifying. This film is set in Maine and follows David Drayton (played by Thomas Jane), a husband and father who takes his eight- year old son Billy (played by Nathan Gamble) and his neighbor Brent (played by Andre Braugher) on a trip to a local convenience store for supplies after a violent thunderstorm causes damage to their house. Soon, the trio along with the rest of the shoppers are alarmed by sirens that go off and the sight of a bloodied man running into the store shouting 'something in the mist!'. Within minutes, the entire town is swallowed by an enormous fog, trapping everyone inside. It is not long before the shoppers learn the sinister secrets of this mysterious phenomenon when a horde of otherworldly creatures break inside and begin preying on them. This is not quite as much of a monster flick as it is of a survival film. After all, the main focus surrounds a large group of confused individuals trapped together coping with confusion what on to do under terrifying situations. Nonetheless, Frank Darabont holds no restraints in showcasing the characters' terrifying fight for survival which ends in a series of bloodbaths as the grotesque- looking beasts preying on human flesh. So you do not want to grow emotionally attracted to any characters, because some of them may not last long. And if you bear a weak stomach to gory imagery, take caution because there will be some things you will likely wish to unsee. Furthermore, Darabont proves to be more than capable to maintaining an ominous atmosphere that leave audiences alternating between curling up in their seat and loading their heads and thoughts of what the characters are feeling and what they would do if they were in a similar situation. The visceral tension uproots not just from the blood-thirsty creatures terrorizing the store, but also between poor shoppers themselves. If that isn't enough, there is another antagonist beside the monsters on board, and that Marcia Gay Harden's character Mrs. Carmody, a religious extremist who perceives the unsettling event as the 'End of Days'. Harden packs a punch with her performance, electrifying her role with pure fortitude and heart-thumping humility. If the film deserves any Oscar nomination of any kind, it would most certainly for her in the supporting role. The scariest aspect of her character is that she is mentally unstable and is so buried into her spirituality she is willing to put others in grave danger to preserve her faith. Above all, the tension is powerful, the danger is harrowing, and the atmosphere is purely gut-wrenching as the story builds to a finale that leave many viewers shocked to the core. The Mist is a purely terrifying horror experience that rests in the front ranks of one of the scariest horror pictures Hollywood has delivered in recent memory. In an alternate of words, it marks not only an astounding effort by director Frank Darabont who embraces Stephen King's absorbing source material, but an inspiring cinematic endeavor that truly knows what scary is. If there is any caution to taken before sitting through this film, it is preparing yourself emotionally for the ending that can only be described in one word: Haunting.",9,2,5,17 December 2015
The Bourne Legacy," Though a little shallow in comparison to it's predecessors, The Bourne Legacy is still a bit entertaining
","The Bourne trilogy not only made a stellar contribution to the action genre but effectively established Matt Damon as an unlikely action hero. From it's versatile mix of pulse-pounding thrills and adrenaline-charged action sequences, there is little wonder to why The Bourne trilogy has become a franchise cinema junkies have come to love. But some may ask: was a fourth installment all that necessary? While the franchise has virtually ran it's course required to sustain it as a firmly consistent series, a fourth installment (or perhaps a spin-off) would necessarily be a burden. However, this action thriller goes slightly different direction, taking its focus off the enigmatic Jason Bourne character and bogging down on an all new action hero set. It then all comes down to a plot limited with only narrative connections to the previous films In the process, this involves pulling director Paul Greengrass of the previous two films and the veteran lead Matt Damon out of the picture and substituting Tony Gilroy as director and Jeremy Renner as lead actor. Set shortly after the events of 'The Bourne Ultimatum', the film stars Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, an agent of a Black Ops agency known as Operation Outcome who are set to expose the sinister agency known as Operation Treadstone who were pursuing after Jason Bourne in the previous films. When it's successor Company known as Blackbriar operated by Colonol Eric Byer (played by Edward Norton) conspire to eliminate him, Cross goes on the run with biochemist Dr. Marta Shearing (played by Rachel Weisz) to take them down.It is understandable that moviegoers everywhere were met with skepticism upon learning that Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass would not be making their return. After all, it can be somewhat hard to fully engage in a newly introduced lead character following the departure of a veteran protagonist who was easily more charismatic. Shockingly though, this stand alone sequel carries a surprising amount for an entry veering off in a slightly unfamiliar territory for the franchise. Jeremy Renner boasts a fairly versatile flair as the freshman action hero Aaron Cross as he sets out to face off against the sinister consequences. Predictably so, he doesn't quite pack the same visceral spirit Matt Damon demonstrated in the trilogy. Nonetheless, he shows off an incredible adrenaline-fueled testosterone that gratefully stands out from the somewhat muddled script. Director Tony Gilroy who served as the writer for the previous Bourne films sets up a nice premise during the first half building up firm connections to 'The Bourne Ultimatum' with Jason Bourne only verbally mentioned several times throughout. The only problem is that the story is bit exposition-heavy for nearly half of it's two and a quarter-hour runtime and at times a bit too talky to the point where it falls victim to an occasionally slug pacing. And the fun doesn't quite takeoff until the final half-hour when we reach a climatic action sequence. From there on, that is when we watch Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz on the run as bullets starts flying and cars starts flipping. These two easily catch the eyes in the midst of the large cast including Edward Norton is given very little to do offer than conspiring the plot to kill the lead character.The Bourne Legacy may fall shallow to the original Jason Bourne trilogy in terms of direction, it still boasts a surprising amount of entertainment enough to distract viewers from the unfavorable absence of Matt Damon's Jason Bourne. In conclusion, it is a slick action thrill ride that works fine even if Tony Gilroy's script and direction suffer in a few areas.",7,0,1,6 January 2017
The Game," The Game works good, but not as well as Fincher's previous film
","Director David Fincher shocked audiences everywhere with his dark and grim 1995 thriller 'Se7en' starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Fincher continues his ingenious twists and suspense with this mind-bending thriller that is less compelling, but retains the wit and energy of his style of direction. Michael Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orten, an arrogant San Francisco financial investor living a lonely life . On his 48th birthday, Orten receives a gift from his younger brother Conrad (played by Sean Penn). His gift happens to be a key to a strange company named Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Upon visiting this company, Orten begins experiencing some strange and unfamiliar occurrences that alternates his life. With the help of a local woman named Christine (played by Deborah Kara Unger), he must solve the mystery behind what he believes his reality and what he believes is an illusion. Being a fan of David Fincher's works, this is a film that I had to see. It is not as dark and somber as his previous film 'Se7en' and is a bit more complex in terms of storytelling, but still brings his decent directing style to the screen. This film offers something a little different than rookie detectives investigating murders and facing down a vicious serial killer. Playing almost like a two-hour episode of Twilight Zone, the plot blossoms with frequent twists and turns, and soaring thrills. Those who struggle to follow along with the challenging storyline however, may be left deprived from the film's suspense. Yes, comprehending the storyline can be a bit of a challenge at times. Nonetheless, the story stays strong and diligent for the most of the time, nearly every scene is almost impossible to predict. The main characters played by Michael Douglas and Deborah Kara Unger are pretty solid and the performances are praise-worthy. Sean Penn who plays the younger brother who though offers some decent acting, is a bit underused for the most part. The film sustains itself strongly until it reaches its climax. At that point, the film falls pretty flat. Overall, The Game is a decent movie while it last. It definitely doesn't level up to the ranks of David Fincher's other movies and does suffer from a few flaws. However, it is still a satisfying picture and most of what it needs to do.",7,0,1,22 November 2015
Kick-Ass," Spawning with audacious humor, gleeful profanity, and over-the-top violence, this film sets stone to a subversive turn in the superhero genre
","Kick-Ass is not a superhero film that will leave parents ecstatic of taking their children to. It is a violent, profanity-charged action spectacle that pulls no punches when exercising its hard R-rating. By many means, that is the good news. Adapting from the pages of the comic books series of the same name by Mark Millar, this subversive action flick embraces its anarchic spirit with its gleeful use of profanity and stylized violence to portray the genre in ways many forms of the media have never found the guts to do before. With English director Matthew Vaughn in the operator's chair, the movie offers a witty question and places it into action: How come no one's ever tried to be a superhero in real life? This question is put into a context in a form that is not meant to be firmly realistic, but to grip viewers in an unapologetically raunchy, yet wildly fun time. That is if you can handle the offensive edge to its brutally irreverent material. This film follows Dave Lizewski (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson), a high school comic book geek who asks his best friends Todd (played by Evan Peters) and Marty (played by Clark Duke) 'How can no one's ever tried to be a superhero?'. While the answer becomes obvious that being a superhero in real life would be dangerous, Dave nonetheless orders a wet-suit online and decides to become a superhero. There is no problem, of course, he does not have any superpowers. After stopping a vicious mugging near a local convenience store while recorded by a bystander via cellphone, Dave becomes a viral internet sensation and adopts his superhero name 'Kick-Ass'. His fame inspires 11-year old Mindy MacCready (played by Chloe-Grace Moretz) and her father Damon (played by Nicolas Cage) who join in the life of crime-fighting as Hit-Girl and Big Daddy respectively, in attempt to seek revenge of the city's drug dealer Frank D'Amico (played by Mark Strong) who has his teen son Chris (played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse) suit up as his own superhero Red Mist to lure them in a trap.Is this movie realistic? No. Is it meant to be? Absolutely not. What one of the most respectable aspects of this flick is being self- aware of itself while energetically poking fun at the superhero genre. Matthew Vaughn's ability to showcase the genre in a rebellious fashion without fear to pushing the boundaries of its mean-spirited humor is where the source of fun lies. Vaughn effectively crafts a story of a young teen who grows to extreme measures to fulfill an unrealistic dream of becoming a superhero, while spacing enough room for some stylized, effectively shot action sequences and gunplay to result in plenty of gunfire and blood splatters all for the sake to provoking both laughter and adrenaline. And the main figure in the action is the eponymous character played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson breathes plenty of charisma and humanity in the role. However, there is a bigger show stealer in the crowd, and that is Chloe Grace-Moretz in her relentlessly bold role as Hit-Girl. If you capable of handling an excess of F-bombs spewed from the mouth of an 11-year old girl who slices and kills people with a katana, you are in for a joy ride with a performance that have people talking about it for quite some time. While the role has been subject to some controversy, there is no doubt that Moretz hits the jackpot in the character. So brace yourself! Mark Strong, playing the villain Frank D'Amico, is no game changer, but makes for an interesting portrayal of a man burning with corruption. And the good news is that the cast does a magnificent job at contributing to the comedic tone of the film, as opposed to the more somber moments that come occasionally during the proceeding. Kick-Ass is a subversive superhero action thrill ride that nicely opens doors to directions the genre has rarely gone before. It is funny, wild, but brutally violent and offensive to the point that will leave some sensitive viewers, particularly the conservative right, uncomfortable. Nonetheless, it makes for a wildly entertaining good time.",9,0,1,4 August 2017
Gran Torino," Clint Eastwood hits home in this inspiring and brutally arresting drama
","It's hard to set low expectations for a Hollywood piece starring and directed by Clint Eastwood, the old actor who's spawned as a major Hollywood icon as well as an iconic figure to the American culture. For the past six decades, this fine actor has brought smiles an praises to fans everywhere from his portrayal of the nameless cowboy in the Dollars trilogy to his awe-inspiring directorial works in recent years, and his legacy still continues. This captivating drama starring the iconic actor as well as directed him isn't quite up the par with his legendary works, and can be easily be seen as just one of his minor pieces; but the energy he delivers from both his acting and directorial skills still deserve our attention. Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a disgruntled Korean War veteran who's just lost his beloved wife and now lives alone in a depressed state. The old man chooses to alienate himself from everyone including his family, and can't bare to have anyone in his property, particularly a Korean family who moves in next door in the racially diverse neighborhood. Though he unexpectedly makes acquaintance with the teenager girl Sue (played by Ahney Her), he gains tension towards her younger brother Thao (played by Bee Vang) after he sneaks into his garage one night attempting to steal his 1972 Gran Torino under the pressure of his cousin's gang members. Kowalski sets out to reform the young teen by developing a bond with him, and soon unexpectedly finds himself drawn into protecting the family against the gangs that threaten them. Clint Eastwood serves as the pinnacle and emotional core that embraces the beauty of this film. Though there are a few flaws in terms of narrative, his brutally gripping portrayal of the lead character manages to lay those blemishes to obscurity. In the beginning of the film, we are introduced to his character who is gripped with tragedy and struggles with his faith with only his church preacher Father Janovich (played by Christopher Carley) being his aiding hand. Before too long, the character retains a grumpy, tough-minded, and prejudicial demeanor as he's grown hate to everyone of various racial status. One scene the young Korean teenager beaten and harassed by a gang who put him in a dog pile on Kowalski's yard, only to be interrupted by Kowalski himself who points a rifle at them and threatens to open fire if they don't leave his property. The scene is truly intense and sparks a fair amount of tension and unease. Furthermore, the character's near-constant use of racial slurs towards Asians and African-Americans and intimidating threats punctuate his cynical and hard-to-like nature. Clint Eastwood gives honestly one of his most arresting performances in recent years. He's an actor who doesn't take commitment for his role for granted. The almost equally powerful aspect of the film is the ironic relationships between the main character and the young Korean teenager who is brilliantly portrayed by Bee Vang. We watch as the bond between the two characters changes not only the troubled young man from turning to a life of crime by his cousin's tyrannical gang but also Kowalski's attitude towards the family and his determination to protect the family he once despised. The atmosphere is both dark and deeply moving, particularly the powerful and bittersweet ending.Gran Torino is a dark, yet enthralling drama anchored by a gripping performance by Clint Eastwood and a powerful story that is hard to ignore. The film is an interesting piece of cinematic work that though may feel like a minor piece compared to Eastwood's other work, gracefully deserves your attention but only for mature audiences who can handle the dark, cynical tone of the story.",9,3,5,16 July 2016
The Hurt Locker," Gritty, powerful, and packed with visceral intensity, The Hurt Locker is a groundbreaking war experience
","War is no picnic, and the heat of active combat is defiantly overwhelming which is powerfully demonstrated in this gritty war drama set in the heat of the controversial Iraq war. Relieving from the political controversies and social commentary of the Iraq War in favor of focusing on the hellish conditions of active combat in the Middle East, director Kathryn Bigelow crafts a tense, action-heavy experience following a team of United States army soldiers facing the unforgiving reality where the odds are tested and the inner beings of the men in uniforms are challenged to great lengths. Rather than setting the action in the midst of a specific battle, the film revolves around a soldier hired to do a job even more hazardous than shooting and dodging bullets of fellow Iraqis: disarming bombs. And it takes an ambitious filmmaker like Bigelow to effectively capture the visceral magnitude of the action and a writer like Mark Boal to illustrate the story to an astounding degree. What results is an authentic portrait of contemporary warfare. It is just another brutal rendition following a small chapter on our country's war in the Middle East. While there are a few breaks taken from the harsh atmosphere and moments revolving around some humor, these come far and few in between. Set in the hot streets of Baghad during the Iraq War, the film follows elite soldiers Sergeant JT Sanborn (played by Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (played by Brian Geraghty) of an army bomb disposal unit who hire Staff Sergeant William James (played by Jeremy Renner) as the leader of their squad after their former leader is killed in an bomb disposal attempt gone wrong. At first, he seems like the right guy for the job. However, their loyalties are for him are soon tested upon witnessing his seemingly unorthodox ways of handling his duty as the city erupts into a deadly conflict. On both a technical and narrative standpoint, this film delivers the gold. It is a brutally realistic portrayal of active combat that neither glorifies war or condemns it but simply paints the vicious conditions of a country torn apart by international conflict between the east and west. And it is all captured through a documentary- style cinematography by Barry Ackroyd who adopts his filming style reminiscent to Paul Greengrass. The mastermind by this is Kathryn Bigelow crafts the action with palpable tension that not only ravages the atmosphere but pierces the audiences with a feel they are not watching the action through a screen but instead witnessing it as if they were there in the heat of the moment. Every moment Staff Sergeant William James approaches a bomb preparing to defuse, the suspense quickly revs up as all it takes is one wrong move and he will be vaporized into a fiery explosion. An even greater and tension-filled highlight of these moments is showcased during the car bomb sequence when the soldiers spends his precious time studying a bomb trying to disarm it while his comrades are eyeballed by hundreds of Iraqis with suspicious intentions. The scene is enough to make your heart rate increase to the speed of light. And what Jeremy Renner as James? This actor gracefully gets the job done, portraying the role with humanity and complex personality. It seems like Bigelow knew what she was doing when she casted him as the front-runner. Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty makes good use for their role, showing off their acting chops and never letting a moment go to waste. The Hurt Locker is gritty, powerful war picture that captures the visceral energy of active combat and packs a powerful punch with its craft thanks to Kathryn Bigelow at the wheel. Above all, this is likely one of the best modern war movies helmed in recent years, if not a masterpiece of its somewhat underpopulated genre. It is a not movie to enjoy, but simply to experience to understand the grueling conditions of the Middle East under armed conflict.",10,1,1,12 August 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," The X-Men make a surprising but flawed return to the big screen
","It's been sixteen years since the debut of the X-Men franchise in 2000, and the series is shown to still be running. Director Bryan Singer has given grace to the franchise, though it has fallen victim to a few disappointments along the way, take 'X-Men: Origins' for example. This ninth installment to the series continues the story after the events of 'Days of Future Past' when our hero Wolverine traveled back in time to save the world from the tyrant robots known as The Sentinels and restored peace, though the peace for the mutants was only temporary. The film opens up in ancient Egypt with the awakening of the most powerful mutant in the world Apocalypse (played by Oscar Isaac), a mutant born thousands of years ago as a god and is capable destroying absolutely everything in this path. When the mutants learn of his return and discover this plan to completely wipe out civilization as we know it while assisted by his four horsemen: Storm (played by Alexander Shippe) Angel (played by Ben Hardy), Psylocke (played by Oliva Munn) and later joining them is Magneto (played by Michael Fassbender). To an grueling effort to save humanity, the mutants band together to defeat Apocalypse once and for all. Joining the mutants is Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), The Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Quiksilver (Evan Peters), along with some newcomers including Nightcrawler (Kodi-Smit McPhee), Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), and Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) assisted by Professor Charles Xavier (Jams McAvoy).This film serves a pleasant continuation to the X-Men storyline, but it's not quite as fresh as it should be, hitting a few flaws along the way. The film begins with a truly compelling premise and introduction of the main villain Apocalypse to kick off the story which follows an antagonist who is portrayed as a god. So yes, the film does seem to implant some biblical symbolism in the story including the four horseman of the Apocalypse which some may be familiar with in the Bible. The execution of the story is strong enough to maintain interest. But if there is a major flaw in the story, it lies within the pacing along with the main villain Apocalypse himself. After a compelling introduction our antagonist, the story journeys through a bloated amount of exposition, moving the plot at an unnecessarily slow pace during the first half. I can't argue that the establishment of Magneto's story and his transformation from an innocent man to a tragic anti-hero, everything else feels a bit confused, at least until the story finally kicks off during the second half. The same goes for Apocalypse. With a villain as powerful and legendary as him, viewers would expect him to be treated with proper development. The part this villain fails at providing a clear motivation as why is trying to destroy the world other than just to destroy it. Without a solid motivation, the result is a villain that feels rather underdeveloped, though he reaches redemption from a decent performance by Oscar Isaac.While the film may not bless with the most engrossing villain of the franchise, we are fortunately granted with of course, exhilarating visual effects and action sequences to pinnacle our excitement. The action sequences are fun as ever, and given by the impressive CGI, they're quite pulse-pounding to watch. The climatic battle during the final twenty minutes are easily some of the best moments. Like the previous film Days of Future Past, Quik Silver played by Evan Peters earns his time to shine in another of his big 'freeze-motion' scene accompanied a classic 80s soundtrack (Haha!). Apocalypse on the other hand, is cool to look at but the CGI and costume design on Oscar Isaac is not too impressive or particularly scary enough to make him look menacing. Even if the visuals effects don't impress you, it's great to see some of our favorite cast members return to the screen along with newcomers like Tye Sheridan and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Cyclops and Nightcrawler. The performances are incredible, especially Michael Fassbender who delivers as captivating, emotionally-driven portrayal of the iconic Magneto. Is his performance Oscar-worthy? No, but it stands truly memorable.X-Men Apoaclypse may feel like a slight step backwards in the series, but it's solidly entertaining and marks an accomplished opportunity by director Bryan Singer as well as a worthy kickstart to the summer, even if it hits some flaws in the process. This film is worth seeing, especially for X-Men fans and bound to score big riches at the box office, much like every other Marvel-based picture.",7,4,9,27 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Great sequel to the first spiderman
","After seeing the first movie, I was excited for this one. I watched this the other day I was pleased. This movie was a lot like what I was expecting. I enjoyed the characters, especially the way Harry Osbourne was portrayed; after seeing Dane Dehaan as Andrew in chronicle I knew he would be just the right person to play Harry. Jamie Foxx also did an excellent job playing Electro. His acting wasn't the only I found intriguing, I was also fascinated by the way he looked with his static blue body made of electricity than how he looked in the comics.The movie had a much darker tone than the first one. It focused quite a bit on the relationship between Peter and Gwen which I found irrelevant to the story and also on Peter trying to learn more about his father. Overall, the plot wasn't too bad and the movie was quite entertaining.",8,1,3,2 September 2014
Ex Machina," Cerebrally challenging and entrancing in its visual scope, Ex Machina is a powerful sci-fi showcase with spellbinding gravity
","As physicist Stephen Hawking once said, artificial intelligence could draw an end to mankind. That, however, is just a theory of the hazards when technology drastically surpasses human intelligence. This concept is solidly aligned in this psychological science- fiction thriller featuring Alex Garland, writer of '28 Days Later', in his directorial debut, a movie that takes artificial intelligence and places at the forefront of its story that defies against common tropes of its genre. With Garland's hefty directorial hand, this movie bears no place for heavy special-effects action-set pieces and instead, runs wild with thought-provoking ideas on human interaction with artificial intelligence and the dangers that rise when augmenting human smarts with cutting-edge technology. In this case, Garland doesn't hold back when challenging viewers at a cerebral level nor does he take sleek visual storytelling for granted. He just lets it unfold. This film follows Caleb (played by Domhall Gleeson), a 26-year old computer programmer of an internet company who is selected to participate in an experiment on artificial intelligence run by larger-than-life business CEO Nathan (played by Oscar Isaac). This experiment places him face-to-face with an intelligent humanoid Ava (played by Alicia Vikander) who bears a robotic body and a human face. While competing with her in a Turing Test in evaluate her human qualities, the experiment steadily grows more and more surreal when Ava reveals to much more human than both Caleb and Nathan imagine. One thing to say for sure is that this film will not hold appeal for those craving for pulse-pounding, nor will it engage with viewers who lack the patience of a slow-paced narrative. The film moves very slow as it dedicates a great portion of its time building upon its characters and reeling in scientific ideas about artificial intelligence that dare to challenge the minds of its audience. Alex Garland is the mastermind behind the script which allows the characters grow in a manner that leaves viewers questioning each step they take and their psychology that grows when the experiment takes for surreal turn. Morals are tested, lives are at stake, and the fate of the characters are dedicated by the dubious choice of actions. The psychological aspect comes from the interaction between Caleb and Ava as they are monitored by Nathan who bears profoundly questionable intentions. By no means is there is a clear answer to his moral obligations. Is he a man trying to revolutionize technology for the good? Or is he a manipulator who is just a few step away from letting technology run amok for the sake of dominating humankind? Viewers will be divided on this. And Oscar Isaac brings a poignant delivery as the morally skeptical God- like engineer. But perhaps it may not beneath to compete with Alicia Vikander who's pose as the humanoid Ava dominates the atmosphere, which is solidly supported by the eerie music score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury. Domhall Gleeson is strong in his role, which bears a performance that sadly trumps over the bearing interest of his credulous character. Ex Machina is an uncompromising science-fiction showcase succeeds not just on entertaining, but challenging audiences on an intellectual level while lending a hand on a powerful visual methodology. This movie sets a remarkable start on Alex Garland in the directorial world, and above all, demands the attention of those who bear the patience of its sophisticated plot and a wild delivery of scientific intelligence is prepared to throw at them.",9,0,3,22 October 2017
Transformers," Michael Bay's Transformers is an energetic, hyperkinetic explosive fun. Someone pass the popcorn
","This loud, explosive live-action adaptation of Hasbro's popular toy franchise powerfully represents the signature big-budget filmmaking methodology of Michael Bay. It is 144 minutes of loud explosions and heavy metal-on-metal mayhem compiled in a dumb popcorn movie deluxe. Upon sitting through the hour mark, it is clear that Bay does not intend on engaging viewers at an intellectual level. That does not meant this film aborts on deliver an enormous amount of fun. Produced by Dreamworks and Paramount Pictures, This bombastic science-fiction piece sees Michael Bay operating on his trademark visual style, pumping the adrenaline-fueled testosterone through over-the-top explosions and brisk pacing. The outcome is a wild ride flowing with just enough to distract from the sporadically clumsily narrative. This film follows 17-year old Sam Witwicky (played by Shia Labeouf), a high student junior who is surprised with a 1979 Chevrolet Camaro by his father (played by Kevin Dunn). What the young man doesn't know is that the car is an autobot in disguise. When the car morphs into the giant Autobot, Sam and his beautiful crush Mikaela (played by Megan Fox) find themselves into in between a war between the Autobots lead by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) and the Decepticons who are in pursuit of a mysterious cube known as the Allspark, a powerful cube capable opening up a world the afterlife of both the Autobots and the Decepticons. In the process, they must escape from the suspicious law enforcement officials led by Agent Simmons (played by John Turturro).With Michael Bay behind the steering wheel, this movie discards from the elements of the 1986 animated movie, with the first one being the feature of human characters put into the others. The second being considerably less kid-friendly than what long-time fans have been devoted to. This movie takes the violent robot-on-robot action and cranks up a notch in a noisy, explosion-laden galore; in addition to some teen-oriented humor. Nevertheless, Bay knows how to deliver the fun and fulfill the promises of rambunctious action set pieces -- and there is plenty of it. Building are crumbled to pieces, cars are flipped over, and the streets are littered with robotic debris showering everywhere. These sequences are the biggest attractions to this bombastic thrill ride, and manage to stand above all other aspects, particularly the plot. Surrounding the plot involving a hot conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons is a slew of subplots that at times put the story in a little topsy turvy, one involving the government agency pursuing after Sam and Mikaela for questioning on the whole giant robot chaos, another involving Rachel Taylor and Anthony Anderson in which makes very little sense. Above all, the best thing the writer give the story is that it at least make somewhat sense. But for those who just come in for the action and visual grandeur, the story may likely be the least of their concern. As for the acting department, Shia Labeouf is okay in the role of Sam Witwicky, swarming with cheeky humor and humility. Megan Fox on the other hand, stands out more for serving as eye candy with her sex appeal than for her performance. With frequent lingering shots of her body, this film holds very little restraints for sexualizing her, for better or worse. John Turturro has a few odd laughs in his scenes, but nothing that is likely to raise the eyebrows. Transformers is an explosive action thrill ride bound to please not only fans who grew up with the popular toy franchise (or TV shows), but also most certainly those hungry for a near-two hours some heavy special-effects mayhem. It is loud, it is feverishly energetic, but most importantly, it is a whole of fun.",8,2,2,15 June 2017
Lincoln," Steven Spielberg's biographical piece is magnificent, if a little meandering
","Steven Spielberg brings a masterful vision and storytelling to the screen when it comes to tackling historical periods. His awe-inspiring visionary shined brightly in the World War II genre when he wrestled on films like Academy Award winner 'Schinder's List' portraying the horrors of the Holocaust, and 'Saving Private Ryan' which centered on a fictional story, but with a devastatingly authentic portrait of active combat. It is safe to say this director really knows his American History. In this biographical drama set during the Civil War era, Spielberg captures an ingenious portrayal of one of the most iconic political figures in American history: Abraham Lincoln, the sixteenth president of United States. This iconic figure however, was more than just a president in a tall hat, he was a man who sparked a revolution on our country brought grace through his political intuition before his notorious assassination. Daniel Day-Lewis steps in the role as Abraham Lincoln in this historical piece following his final months of his presidency during the concluding year of the Civil War. In desperate measures to end slavery of African Americans, Lincoln pushes the Congress to enact the Thirteenth Amendment which was set to outlaw slavery. Fighting against the odds of the Confederate who's in favor of ending the war, but keeping slavery. Lincoln must acquire the support of his politicians including Secretary of State William Seward (played by David Straithairn) to win the voting at the House of Representatives against the democratic forces, while facing a troubling relationship with his wife Mary (played by Sally Field) and his Union Army soldier Robert (played by Joseph-Gordon Levitt).Steven Spielberg is tremendous at painting an uncompromising portrait of the Civil War period, and the political world that defined that era. Opening with a brutal battle sequence between the Union and the Confederate Army featuring bloody combat with countless soldiers slaughtered and drenched in the mud, the movie captures it's grueling historical subject matter with plenty of grit and spirit, and Spielberg's compelling vision of the historical period doesn't end there. From the moody production design, to the appropriately written dialogue, to the costume design; Spielberg does a magnificent job on creating an environment that feels believable the time oft he story's setting. But when portraying a story of the historical figures' presidency in the height of the Civil War, one of the biggest (if not the biggest) selling point is the screenplay written by playwright Tony Kushner who last collaborated with Steven Spielberg in the writing of 'Munich' in 2005. Driven by Kushner's script, the film presents a smart, informative story revolving around Abraham Lincoln and his significant measures on getting the Thirteenth Amendment passed to abolish slavery, and the plot focusing on his struggle against the Democratic Party who opposed his political ideas. The script makes great effort on capturing the story fact-by-fact, while supplementing a few notable liberties in the process. Although the way in which the story is executed does result in a very slow pace that tends to kill the interest in the story, particularly for those with little patience. But at the same time, it also results in a story that provides a valuable history lesson for both children (if they're even interested) and adults. For a highly influential political figure, must be one of the Hollywood's most actors talented actor to step into their shoes. That is where Academy Award winner Daniel Day-Lewis comes in place. Lewis provides a deeply enthralling performance as the titular character, delivering sheer humanity and life into the role. From the first shot introducing his character, Lewis captures a performance so believable, he disappears into his character. And the incredibly done make-up on the actor makes it more possible for us to see not the actor, but the famous figure he is portraying. Sally Field, being the fine actress she is, gives a credible performance as First Lady Mary Lincoln, the wife of Abraham Lincoln who is faced with a tumultuous relationship that threatens to tear their marriage apart. Playing his eldest son is Joseph-Gordon Levitt has some great moments on screen, but perhaps not enough to make him memorable. Along side these actors is a large cast of David Straithairn as a Secretary of State, Tommy Lee Jones as the head of House of Representatives, James Spader as the Republican Party leader who supports Lincoln on his abolishment of slavery, Tim Blake Nelson as the lobbyist Richard Schnell, and Halbrook as another member of the Republican Party in support of Lincoln, the lists goes on. These actors all give some alright performances, but the overload of supporting characters too often render their performances less memorable. After all, Daniel Day- Lewis who gives it all to stand out amongst the cast as the titular character here.Lincoln is a spectacular biographical piece complete with Steven Spielberg's potent direction and a powerful performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Though the overall execution of the film is a bit meandering and slow-paced, it grants us with an enthralling story that is both entertaining and highly informative; and best of all shines a true light on Spieberg's inspiring filmmaking.",9,1,2,21 August 2016
Sing Street," Sing Street is upbeat, charming, and sensational for music fans everywhere
","This teen musical dramedy paints the nostalgia of classic teen flicks from the 80s, and arguably the early days of teen musicals like 'Grease'. Most importantly, it is almost exactly what a teen-oriented musical piece needs to be. It is funny, it is charming, it is upbeat, and it boasts a cast of characters that are thoroughly likable; not to mention the exhilarating musical numbers that take place. Jim Carney, the man behind the dramedy 'Begin Again' is the conductor behind this project. Carney is a genius who captures the innocence of youth and the thoughtful wonders of following your dreams. Although some may consider this just your average high school musical comedy, this claim feels a bit of an understatement. In the age where the teen musical genre is long past its hay days from the late 70s and 80s, this is one of those rare flicks of the genre that really works. Set in 1985 Dublin, this follows 14-year old Conor (played by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo), a misunderstood high school teenager stuck in his broken home life with his bickering parents and his lazy older brother Brendan (played by Jack Reynor). Upon meeting a cute model Raphina (played by Lucy Boynton), Conor forms a rock band with a group of outcasts including Eamon (played by Mark McKenna), Ngig (played by Percy Chamburuka), Larry (played by Conor Hamilton), Garry (played by Karl Rice), and Barry (played by Ian Kenny) in efforts to impress her.It is been a long time since Richard Linklater's 'School of Rock' the last time Hollywood has deliver such an electrifying feel-good musical comedy like this one. This film operates with immense charm and lyrical optimism, and the musical performances by the young cast provide more than a hefty hand for fueling this film's elegant appeal. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo provides an appealing force to be reckon with his singing. Every scene the band play, his voice shines like gold. The musical numbers are far from the classic-type songs that will leave a lasting appeal for many years to come, but they are very lively and not impossible for pinning viewers with the urge to stand up and cheer. The music leaves plenty of room for alluring nostalgia of popular rock music from the 80s. When the atmosphere is not flowing with musical numbers, there is a share humor to handed from the wide cast of characters. The lead character in particular is strongly likable, along with the supporting characters he recruits into his band. One of the sparkling points to the story is the chemistry between Peelo and Lucy Boynton, a romance that while nothing necessarily remarkable, definitely fuels the groovy atmosphere. Jack Reynor who plays the lead character's older brother is quite likable as well, a character who's stuck on the sidelines of the world of adult responsibilities. This guy comes as a form of inspiration to the lead character's optimism and willingness to success.Sing Street is a heartwarming, feel-good musical comedy with an appeal that is nearly irresistible. This movie is an elegant surprise that is likely to appeal to more than just the crowd of music fanatics. Jim Carney sets out to orchestrate a sensational music-based entry, and it excels greatly here, if not breaking any grounds.",9,5,8,18 March 2017
Children of Men," Wildly compelling and thought-provoking tale of a bleak, dystopian future
","Adapting from P.D. James's phenomenal literary work, Alfonso Cuaran embraces a dark, powerful vision in this examination of both a paranoid and terrifying fight for humanity's survival. From the prestigious script by Cuaron and the stellar cinematography to capture the most astonishing moments, the scariest aspect Cuaron incorporates here is not just the concept of humanity threatened by infertility or the violent nature associated with it but how incredibly believable it is. Though such a deeply bleak concept like is highly unlikely to happen, the film makes it quite difficult not to imagine the possibility of the future hitting such turmoil envisioned this story. It is eagerly thought-provoking from beginning to end, but nonetheless compelling in nearly every sense. Set in 2027 in dystopian London, one of the last stable nations alive after the world is devastated by war. All the women in the world have been left infertile, and the youngest individual alive has just died; leading humanity alarmingly close to extinction. But when London native Theo Faron (played by Clive Owen) learns from his former lover Julian (played by Julianne Moore) of an illegal immigrant Kee (played by Clara-Hope Ashitey) who happens to the first pregnant women in nearly two decades, Theo sets out to escort the women across the violent, war-ridden country to board a ship that will take her safety. Alfonso Cuaran drives this film in a direction that cites more interest in telling a powerful story of a society facing a grim downfall than explaining the reason behind the disaster that threatens the very existence of mankind, and it's not long before the plot moves in ways that render the explanation behind the mysterious phenomenon less and less important. The plot sets in the following the news of an 18-year old boy, the youngest human being alive dies, and atmosphere settles with every last living adult alive facing a seemingly inevitable doom. From that point, we are left with endure a bleak and paranoid atmosphere, with a very few moments of levity. One of which involves Michael Caine as a old pot-smoking hippie who becomes a brief aid for the lead character on his journey, and only with little screen time. Along the way, we are set on an extraordinary journey of hope and desperation, with themes of war and genocide of illegal immigrants playing out. Alfonso Cuaran portrays these elements with such gravity and authenticity, and with a deep emotional core punctuating nearly every scene; there is never a moment that feels wasted. Few of these scenes involves Clive Owen's character and the supporting characters in the midst of the mass genocide that tears their surroundings to shreds, and these scenes sparkle with breathtaking cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezski, with some long uninterrupted shots progressing as long as several minutes. The cast consisting of Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, Chiwetel Eijiofor, Michael Caine, and Clara-Hope Ashitey, falls nothing short of ambition here. Clive Owen, taking the lead role, is fantastic with his performance with great sincerity. Along his side is Chiwetel Eijifor as the leader of an immigrants' rights group who is the initial protector of the poor pregnant women Kee. He delivers a decent performance for the rather small amount of screen time he has, but definitely not one of his most memorable roles. Julianne Moore, multi- Academy Award nominee, is also given her time to shine here but like Chiwetel Eijiofor, carries a slick shortage of time on screen. Michael Caine plays an old hippie isn't really given much to do other than provide a little light-hearted relief from the grim atmosphere that pervades the film. Clara-Hope Ashitey on the other hand, is arguably the most riveting actress in the picture. Blooming with heart and humanity, Ashitey nails her role and provides a pleasant on screen presence throughout. Whether her performance soars in the Oscar caliber or not is difficult to speak of. Needless to say, she delivers all what she needs to do. Children of Men is a powerful dystopian science-fiction adventure with a thought-provoking treat from beginning to end. It is a deeply inspiring take on P.D. James's acclaimed novel, and sits a well example of an cinematic translation of literary done right, even if it spits a few liberties form the novel. The performances are powerful, the cinematography is profoundly stunning, and the script by Alfonso Cuaran succeeds on capturing a realistic feel of a futuristic society in gone to turmoil.",9,3,5,9 September 2016
Event Horizon," Gruesome, eerie science-fiction gorefest boast striking visuals, but shallow writing
","From director Paul W. S. Anderson comes an eerie science-fiction horror thrillers that takes audiences on a ride through it's dark, tasty visuals, but sadly without an alluring screenplay to underpin the stunning aspect. Upon watching this film, it certainly wasn't too difficult to appreciate the efforts Anderson displays on screen; but I could not help but notice the high amount of elements borrowed from many superior science-fiction thrillers like James Cameron's 'Aliens' and John Carpenter's 'The Thing'. It's clear that Anderson is showering in inspiration and knows how to have fun with the genre, but the film as a whole doesn't always work, at least not too well in the narrative department. While it showers the screen with enough blood and gore to make the sensitive crowd squirm and occasional nightmare-inducing to the mix, Anderson attempts on generating a thoroughly frightening experience come with only half-hearted results. Set in the futuristic 2047 in the depths of outer space, the film centers on a crew of astronauts: Captain Miller (played by Laurence Fishburne), Lieutenant Stark (played by Joely Richardson), Cooper (played by Richard Jones), D.J (played by Jason Isaacs), Justin (played by Jack Noseworthy), Smith (played by Sean Pertwee), and Medical Technician Peters (played by Kathleen Quinlan) on an investigation for a lost spaceship known as Event Horizon. Assisted by the creator of Event Horizon, the crew embark on an exploration to the missing spaceship, only to encounter a terrifying force that picks off the crew one by one. Compared to other science-fiction features, this one is nowhere near as memorable or inventive as it sets out to be, nor does it embrace the proper caliber to sustain a truly visceral experience. Luckily, director Paul W. S. Anderson packs just enough thrills and striking visuals to make up a somewhat exciting experience, but the suspense and horror does fall flat at times; especially during the first half. Capturing a claustrophobic atmosphere and nightmarish imagery ranging from grossly deformed human figures with gauged-out eyes, to dismembered mutant bodies, to creepy blood-covered paranormal entities; there is no denying how absurd and horrifying this movie can get as it journeys through plenty of creepy imagery that is bound to make the weak stomach squirm. And the dazzling production design of the spaceship interior and the corridors which borrow heavily from 'Alien' are quite nice to look at, especially with the decent cinematography to expand upon the view. It's too bad however, that the storyline falls short of substance, ending the plot with major questions unanswered (dealing with plot points I rather not spoil) and characters sorely underdeveloped. The crew is trapped in a ship that has been to Hell. As interesting as it is, the film never makes a solid attempt to explain what is going on. Though Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill give an okay, if flawed performances as the lead characters, neither of them manage to stand out too far above the rest of the cast who's characters are left in two-dimensional entities. This is not the stay that none of the characters aren't likable, but sadly none of them are uninteresting in a way that you keep rooting for their survival. And it definitely does not help that the writers pin the characters with inconsistently laughable dialogue. Event Horizon may not the proper narrative heft to support it's flawed storyline, but offers just enough thrills and excitement to make up for the blemishes in it's script. It is not a film that reaches the level of a visceral horror experience, nor does it even come close to. By the end however, it makes for a pulse-pounding thrill ride brought together by the efforts of Paul W. S. Anderson.",6,0,0,16 August 2016
Big Hero 6," Beautifully animated and fun filled family adventure
","Disney has brought many gifts and rarely disappoints me. Big Hero 6 is one of the best Disney films I have seen since last year's Frozen. This film is fun, clever, imaginative, and filled with spectacle. While the film is somewhat similar to Pixar's The Incredibules due the film's plot dealing with robots and and children with superpowers, it is very enjoyable and would easy please children as well as parents. Big Hero 6 is not only brings out the charm with heart-filling characters and comic relief but has some of the most dazzling CGI I have seen in a Disney movie. The animators did a fantastic job on the character models and the environment was nice looking. My favorite character would probably be Baymax. What's not to like about a funny, inflatable robot who cracks funny one-liners,has the power to heal, and assists Hiro (main character) on his quest to defeat an evil scientist? I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. I recommend this movie to all parents and children. Big Hero is a family thrill ride!!!",10,83,124,25 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Bursting with exhilarating spectacle, unexpected twists, and profound respect for its characters and story, The Last Jedi is an uncompromising force to be reckoned with
","So, the beloved Star Wars saga has reached the eighth chapter and now continues the story with our heroes battle against the diabolical First Order. After making a warm welcome back with 'The Force Awakens' in 2015, the Star Wars franchise has made a remarkable recovery from the damper left by the botched prequel trilogy launched by the hands of George Lucas. Although The Force Awakens was a flawed chapter as it drew more than enough parallels to 'The New Hope', it marked a significant turning point in the saga. The Last Jedi, directed by Rian Johnson of films such as 'Brick' and the hit time-traveling sci-fi piece 'Looper', is a heartwarming spectacle full of just about everything you desire in a Star Wars movie: killer special effects, compelling expansion of the characters, heart-pounding twists, and a story bursts with near endless excitement from beginning to end. This film strikes at the heart of the franchise with a strong emotional magnitude that keeps you growing hungry for more as it leaves you questioning nearly everything. What is all gonna come down to? And don't worry, this review will be restrained to a spoiler-free frontier. But if you prefer to go in completely blind, just go see the movie and come back later. So, Princess Leia (played by Carrie Fisher) is the now the commander of the Resistance as they continue their fight against the First Order headed by Snoke (played by Andy Serkis). Ex-Stormtrooper Finn (played by John Boyega) has awaken from his coma and escapes with fellow resistance warrior Rose (played by Kelly Marie Tran) on a conquest to foil the First Order. Meanwhile, Resistance fighter Rey (played by Daisy Ridley) is stranded on an island where he encounters the estranged Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill) who he must convince her in battle to settle the score with his nephew Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver). But first, he must teach her the ways of the force. What Rian Johnson has to offer in this jaw-dropping chapter of the epic space opera series is as compelling you can come with the franchise, and with no shortage of fun and thrills to leave you hanging. From the iconic opening credit crawl sequence followed by the massive spaceship battle, to the final sequence, Johnson's admiration for the franchise bursts through just about every frame without sacrificing his opportunity to bring a large barrage of newborn elements to the table. There is nothing more exciting than witnessing as all our favorite iconic characters including Princess Leia, R2-D2, C-3PO, and of course, Luke Skywalker, make their return to the galaxy. Then let's not leave out our new characters from 'The Force Awakens' as they make their trip back to the screen. So, as the story continues the war between the Resistance and the First Order erupted by the diabolical Kylo Ren has lead a life of family issues, the story goes almost full throttle on unleashing shocking emotional twists that very few will see coming. At the same time, the story also allows for deep expansion upon our characters including Rey and Kylo Ren who contribute to a powerful storyline that dares to grip your seats until the end. Excellently paced and blistering with moments of clever humor, the excitement is near endless. The storyline, however, following John Boyega's Finn and Kelly Marie Tran's Rose is perhaps less of a home-run, especially with their chemistry lacking the heart that Boyega boasted with Daisy Ridley in the previous film. While there are a few good moments to spare, it would have helped if the film kept things interesting when focusing on these two. Nonetheless, Boyega and Tran make good use of their roles as does Ridley as Rey. The rest of the cast including Carrie Fisher who is sadly no longer with us, boasts a powerful performance as ever-charismatic Leia that leads a helping hand to a warming tribute. Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, and Benicio Del Toro all hit the right marks. And the excitement soars as the film wraps things up in an explosive climatic war sequence, with one beautifully shot Light Saber battle in the desert, and the other taking place inside the Resistance ship as it explodes in a fiery chaos with guns flaring everywhere and stormtroopers getting blown away before our very eyes. It is a true special-effects joy ride that does just about everything it can to feast the eyes, and that is not without John Williams's poetic score to complete the picture. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a sucker punch of entertainment that holds a special place in the heart for all Star Wars fans, and another for everyone else. Rian Johnson proves he has remarkable respect of the characters, the story, and the overall spirit that makes the franchise such an endearing gem to the genre. Best movie in the franchise? That is highly debatable, especially when looking at the masterful hit that was 'Empire Strikes Back', but everyone will certainly come out with differentiating opinions. After all, this is Star Wars we are talking about. And may the force be with you!",9,5,21,15 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians of The Galaxy is a wild superhero action spectacle with plenty of fun
","With the end of summer blockbuster season approaching, Marvel have managed to drop in yet another action-packed comic book thrill ride. The product here is a cinematic adaptation of 'Guardians of The Galaxy'. While the comic book series never made a household name like many notable entries such as 'X-Men' or 'Spiderman', Marvel Studios has proved more than worthy of making an entertaining hit out of lesser known heroes. This is where director James Gunn comes in. Sporting a highly likable cast of Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, and Dave Bautista; this superhero actioner flourishes a hodgepodge of tense, special effects-heavy action set pieces and clever humor in efforts to pull audiences into fun, hyperkinetic thrill ride. And by many means, it's a whole lot of fun. Set in the distant future, this film follows Peter Quill a.k.a. Star Lord (played by Chris Pratt), a hot-headed space explorer who finds himself in deep conflict with an evil mastermind Ronan (played by Lee Pace) when he steals a magical artifact. Crashing landing on Planet Xander, Peter forms an unexpected alliance with quartet of mercenaries including a talking, gun-totting raccoon named Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), green-skinned alien Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana), a tree-like humanoid Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), and a revenge-hungry gray monster known as Drax the Destroyer (played by Dave Bautista). Together, they compete an epic showdown against Ronan in attempt to stop from wiping out the planet.Marvel Studios is incredibly known for taking the popular comic book material and having fun with it, and this film is no exception. Guardians of The Galaxy never quite boasts anything out of the ordinary Marvel superhero grandeur, there is still plenty of handed of a tag team of heroes fighting the galaxy from an evil hot villain with sinister intentions. Though it does not sport heroes as your average cape crusaders, this film introduces all new variety of superheroes and knows how to deliver hell of a good time. From the flashy special effects, to the eye-popping CGI, to the light-hearted characters; the film knows how to deliver the fun without leaving out room for a fully compelling plot and proper character development. Most of the excitement is delivered through a sporadic array of tense action sequences complete with nifty visuals and solid cinematography by Ben Davis. And though the story does a few stabs at more dramatic moments like Drax the Destroyer recounting his dark past of his family and a highly emotional episode in the opening, it rarely cut loose to a dull moment if any. When the story prepares of a moment, audiences are invited enjoy a sweet soundtrack consisting of artists such as The Runaways, B.J Thomas, Redbone, and David Bowie.What fun is a superhero flick without it's fair share of likable heroes? That is where an amazing cast comes in with each member sporting a mix bag of wit and comedic appeal. Leading the pack is Chris Pratt who brings his sheer likability to the screen, delivering both a string of hilarious one-liners and adrenaline-fueled testosterone to his role. Zoe Saldana who's experience in the action genre includes but limited to the 2009 sci-fi hit 'Avatar' along with 'Columbiana' and 'The Losers', delivers a good share of appeal on screen as Gamora. Taking on the role of the loud mouth talking raccoon is Bradley Cooper who delivers arguably the film's biggest comedic appeal with his frequent laugh-out-loud one-liners and energy through his voice. Former professional wrestler Dave Bautista takes his stab at the role of Drax, sporting a dark teal make-up to cover his muscular body. And to much satisfaction, he plays the role pretty solidly. Then there is the 'Fast and Furious' veteran Vin Diesel who providing the low-tone voice of the tree-like figure Groot who's dialogue is greatly limited to the words 'I am Groot'. These four share a spectacular amount of chemistry together that makes them for a charismatic action tag team, thought perhaps not on the level with the Avengers. Lee Pace stands strong as the villain Ronan, though nothing particularly special.Guardians of The Galaxy is a wild superhero action spectacle brought together by the ever popular Marvel Studios. And to satisfying results, it is a whole of fun if not one of the best superheros flicks in recent years. It is a fun ride that is likely to appeal both fans and non-fans of the superhero genre or the comic book series. Predictably so, a box office success shouldn't come to a surprise.",10,1,4,12 August 2014
Evil Dead," Scary, gruesome, over-the-top reimagining of Sam Raimi's classic horror
","Remakes of classic 70s and 80s horror films tend to fall victim to mediocrity nowadays, mainly due to their failure to stay faithful to their original source material. However, once in a blue moon comes a remake of a horror film that though doesn't live up to the bar of its original, manages to pay respect to the original film. Fede Alvaraz's 'Evil Dead', a remake of Sam Raimi's classic horror thriller happens to one of those films, while paying some noticeable liberties. This film follows twenty-something year old David (played by Shiloh Fernandez), along with his three friends who take his younger sister Mia (played by Jane Levy) up a remote cabin to help her recover from her heroin addiction, as opposed to the original which centered on a vacation. When one of the friends unintentionally releases a demonic entity from the Book of the Dead, Mia becomes possessed and unleashes a horrifying terror on everyone. What results from this horror thriller is a truly terrifying experience filled with spine chilling scares as well as enough blood and gore to push its R-rating to the very limit.It is no surprise that this horror remake doesn't manage to top the classic, but after all, has any remake managed to do that? What is important is that this movie succeeds on embracing the spirit of what Sam Raimi brought the 1980s classic by not only paying homages to some of the most memorable scenes like the 'tree rape' scene, but also executing the story in an effective manner. The major difference between this and the original is this takes on a more dark and dramatic tone, unlike Sam Raimi's film which had a more cartoony, tongue-in-cheek approach. This film delivers plenty of scares from start to finish and a sheer amount of suspense to leave at the edge of your seat. If the scares are not enough, many scenes also treat you with an outrageous amount of blood and gore, enough to sensitive viewers sick to their stomach, including the climax which involves raining blood. So this movie stops at just about nothing to shock you to the core and there is rarely a dull moment throughout its runtime. The characters are well drawn out, especially Jane Levy's character who serves as the most prominent character in the story from the moment of her horrifying demonic possession, and the performances earn a solid thumps up. The characters may not stand out like what Bruce Campbell brought in the original Evil Dead trilogy as Ash, but they do whats worth. While it may top what Sam Raimi brought the original film, this Evil Dead remake is both entertaining and spine-chilling scary. It is a great movie to please horror fans and one of the few horror remakes manages to succeed. Fede Alvaraz does an amazing job on capturing the spirit of the original and bringing it to this modern adaption. However, I only recommend this to those with strong stomach to absurd amounts of blood and gore because as I said, there is plenty of it. Otherwise, enjoy!",8,0,3,3 February 2016
The Imitation Game," Great cast and storytelling in this World War II thriller
","Benedict Cumberbatch brings his amazing talent to life in this espionage thriller set during World War II. This film stars Cumberbatch as Alan Turing, a real life mathematician and graduate of Cambridge University, who works with a team of cryptographers to crack the seemingly impossible secret Nazi code. In attempt to go against all odds, Turing builds a complex machine that he believes his capable for cracking the code itself.This is one of the most brilliantly made films of 2014, but perhaps not the best film set during World War II. This takes some complex turns here and there. It does, however, manage to stay intriguing through most of it's time. The film also offers a great cast of actors and strong performances, along with Cumberbatch. Keira Knightley plays Joan Clarke, a woman who Alan Turing hires to assist in the breaking of the Nazi code, and seemingly falls in love with. Then there is Mark Strong, who plays Stewart Menzies, a British general and chief of the British Secret Service. These actors bring top-notch performances to the screen, and I enjoyed them. Matthew Goode, Matthew Beard, and Allen Leech also bring out some great acting.This film also tackles major issues dealing with sexuality. Benedict Cumberbatch's character, Alan Turing, is learned to be homosexual and is in violation of the law as a result. The film not only focuses on his attempt of breaking the Nazi code, but also on the dilemma of his sexuality into politics. In my opinion, I didn't find this to be an important factor to the film, especially as a subplot. While I did find it interesting, I felt that it was tampering with the film's focus a little bit. Overall, I was satisfied with the film, and I think the director and actors did a fantastic job.",9,1,4,14 April 2015
From Dusk Till Dawn," Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino collaboration shows the vampire-horror genre at its best
","Director Robert Rodriguez and producer Quentin Tarantino make their third collaboration after the action film 'Desperado' and the anthology comedy 'Four Rooms' with this exhilarating action-horror extravaganza complete with a brilliant Tarantino script. In this film, George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play brothers Seth and Richie Gecko, two wanted felons by the FBI who have committed a string of bank robberies and homicide. In attempt to flee to Mexico, the brothers kidnap a family of three: Jacob Fuller (played by Harvey Keital), a devoted Catholic father who has recently lost his wife, and his two children Kate (played by Juliette Lewis) and Scott (played by Ernest Liu); who are traveling on vacation in an RV. The brothers order them to drive them to Mexico where they end up at an strip club known as 'The Titty Twister' owned by Carlos (played by Cheech Marin), a Mexican border guard. Things quickly grow awry when the club is revealed to be inhabited by blood-thirsty vampires who ensue a vicious, gore-filled onslaught. The Gecko brothers and the Fuller family team up to defend themselves against the vampire mayhem until the crack of dawn.This action-horror flick present audience with both the amazing action-packed thrills of Robert Rodriguez's style of filmaking and the ingenious style of writing by Quentin Tarantino who also makes an appearance as a main character unlike the brief cameos he's notable for in his films, though his performance may not be on par with his directorial skills. This film basically brings just about everything fans could ask for in both a Rodriguez film and a Tarantino film: top-notch characters, darkly funny dialogue, and an exhilarating plot. Also featuring Salma Hayek who makes an appearance as a sexy bouncer, the film delivers some tense, over-the-top vampire action that while extremely heavy on blood and gore, is very exciting and fun to watch. The beautifully (and scarily) animated vampires will have audience gripping their seats and the intense atmosphere almost perfectly balances the heavy action and scares that will please both action and horror fans. The same can said about the visuals (though slightly cheesy) and production design of the strip club which serves as the main action set for the majority of the film. The performance by George Clooney who is a stranger to roles on the wrong side of the moral compass, sits well as does Harvey Keital who's been collaborator for works by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs).From Dusk Til Dawn sets a textbook example of how an action-horror film should be, and is also one of the best (if not the best) collaborations of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino who later go on to co-directer the B-movie double feature 'Grindhouse' ten years later. If you come across this movie, this would be a good choice for action and horror fans. Although the film isn't anything close to a masterpiece, what is important that is it is fun.",9,1,2,19 November 2015
Jurassic World," Exciting adventure with dazzling visual effects
","It's been fourteen years since the Jurassic Park franchise came to a halt after it's third installment which was critical failure, but nonetheless a box office hit. By today, very few were expecting to seethe dinosaurs to strike back again for more explosive considering the development hell of the third sequel that is was eventually thrown out. With over decades past since the series debut, many will go into this film and wonder whether or not director Colin Trevrrow and executivep producer Steven Spielberg are able to effectively capture spirit of the predecessor, if not the everlasting nostaglia. Judging by the screenplay and visual effects put to great use, this reboot of the series succeeds at doing both, if a little flawed in it's execution. So goes on this time around? Well, this takes place twenty years after the events of the first film, Jurassic Park has re-opened with dinosaurs who are now genetically modified. Working at the park is operations manager Claire (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) who is scheduled a visit with her two nephews Gray (played by Ty Simpkins) and Zach (played by Nick Robinson, and velociraptor trainer Owen Grady (played by Chris Pratt). What starts off as a fine day of enormous tourism turns into utter chaos when the dinosaurs break loose and causing havoc throughout the park.When it comes to rebooting a classic franchise, it is understandable to be fearful of the spirit and novelty to be lost in a sea of failed ideas. Luckily, this film manages to capture almost same fun and excitement fans experienced 22 years ago when the dinosaurs began chomping and roaring on the silver screen. Though the absence of John Williams' classic score and the direction of Steven Spielberg can be gently felt, they both do little to take away from the endless excitement Colin Trevorrow brings the picture. The anticipated intensity begins not long after our prehistoric creatures break loose from their confined territory and launch a massive onslaught throughout the titular theme park attraction, and thousands of calm tourists are quickly triggered into panic mode running and screaming for their dear lives. These sequences are beautifully brought together in sweet CGI and surface level special effects to dazzle the eyes. But the fun doesn't quite end there. The charisma of Chris Pratt is gracefully brought to the screen often alternating between comic relief and light-hearted heroism. Pratt fits perfectly in this role, and his light-hearted personality he brings to the character is often too likable to ignored.Jurassic World is definitely one of the best films of the summer, and by man means makes for a solid, if slightly undermined return for the Jurassic Park franchise. With the wide plethora of explosive visuals and action sequences the feat the eyes hardcore movie goers everywhere, it is a film destined to see a bright sunshine at the box office.",6,35,97,12 June 2015
Black Hawk Down," Gritty, powerful, and intense war movie masterpiece
","Ridley Scott, director of Gladiator (2000), takes the audience into an intense and realistic re-imagining of an ill-fated mission that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia back in 1993, with gritty performances by a strong ensemble cast and spectacular combat action-set pieces. Set in October 1993, Black Hawk Down tells the story of 123 elite U.S soldiers sent to Mogadishu on a mission to capture Somalian warlord Mohamed Farrah Aided, who has lead mass starvation to the country. Before too long, the mission goes terribly awry when the two Black Hawk helicopters are shot down, leaving the U.S army in a brutal fight for their lives against the Somalian army. The film features a stellar cast including Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, Tom Sizemore, Willaim Fichtner, Ewen Bremmer, Jason Isaacs, Orlando Bloom, and many others.What I expect from a war movie is for the horrors of war is to be demonstrated in a strong and authentic manner, and this movie sets a great example of how they should be portrayed. This movie does an incredible job on depicting the harsh reality of soldiers in combat. The plot follows the story how these soldiers are caught in a highly stressful situation when their helicopters are shot down and how they struggle to survive with no help on the way. The combat scenes are absolutely amazing, the camera work and sound editing are very well done and as you are watching these scenes, you get the feeling that you are actually in the middle of the battle. The combat definitely does not hold back in terms of intensity, they are extremely bloody and graphic, and can be tough to watch for those with weak stomachs. At the same time, they are very realistic and give the scenes a gritty atmosphere.While the film does an amazing job on portraying the realism of active combat, the only thing I think it struggles with is the character development. While few of the characters like Josh Hartnett's character Sergeant Matt Eversmann is well constructed and easy to remember, the lot of the characters feel a bit thin, and therefore, not very comprehensible. However, if you really get into the plot and the action, it will be pretty easy to forgive the flawed character development.Black Hawk Down is certainly one of the most realistic and powerful war movies Hollywood has to offer. Ridley Scott did a magnificent job with this movie, and I am proud with the awards it received. This film does get extremely intense, but it is a must-watch for those who have yet to see it.",10,2,3,12 August 2015
Prisoners," Uncompromising and powerful in its portrayal of moral ambiguity, Prisoner is an outstanding psychological thriller that dares to leave an impact
","Children being abducted is every parent's worst nightmare. Facing such an unfavorable circumstance can be quite frightening, if not devastating. What kind of testament of a father seeking for justice against the evil doer who kidnaps his child can French-Candian director Denis Villenueve bring to this powerful whiplash of a psychological thriller? Prisoners is a movie that grabs the heart and dares not the let go while challenges viewers with moral complexities and one of the powerful jabs at 'what would you do' circumstances. Uncompromising and packed with a brutal punch of suspense of psychological weight that is nearly impossible to resist, the film plays no game when testing the audiences' expectations and wringing out psychological elements to dare to think hard long after the end credits roll. One thing is sure, and that is Denis Villenueve shares no room for comfort or easy answers for the characters or the situation surrounding them. And that is only part of what makes this piece shine. Set during the Thanksgiving holidays, the film focuses on Keller Dover (played by Hugh Jackman) and his wife Grace (played by Mario Bello) who invite their friends Franklin (played by Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (played by Viola Davis) over for dinner. The families two young daughters Anna and Joy, both six-years-old, go outside to play. Before they know, the girls are nowhere to be found. Upon contacting the police, the families get help from Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) to search for them. Who the man ends up finding is Alex Jones (played by Paul Dano), a mentally impaired man who owns a RV the girls were climbing, and takes him into custody. Due to the lack of evidence from his mental disability, the police believe him to be innocent and let him go. Keller, however, is not buying it and decides to take matters into his own hands. This film pulls absolutely no punches when exhibiting Keller Dover's descent into vigilantism, and the moral ambiguity that almost immediately consumes him set a powerful, albeit unnerving groundwork for the testament of what extreme measures he is willing to take to get his beloved daughter back. With his eyes pinned on the only known suspect Alex Jones, Keller makes the questionable decision to take him to an abandoned house, tied him up, and tortures him in sporadic sequences that are horrifyingly realistic and difficult to watch. The psychological core rests in the questionable nature of his character to the point where you question whether we should be rooting for him or not. Even his friend Franklin is left uncomfortable by his actions. While it is not too hard to sympathize for a man who's dear flesh and blood has been taken from him, especially when the possibilities of the child's survival declines for each day he or she is not found, it is also hard to stand by his morally dubious actions. But Denis Villenueve knows how to keep things engaging at a solid cerebral level while narrowly confining away from the borders of grim exploitation. And that's including his visual method of storytelling in which is greatly assisted by cinematographer Roger Deakins who captures the simmering heat of the atmosphere with his nifty camera work. As for Hugh Jackman, his performance is definitely a home-run for an emotionally devastated thirsty for justice. Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki is another great asset as well, pinning sheer humanity to a role that requires significant grit. Paul Dano, on the other hand, takes on a slightly easier role that requires very little dialogue for a character with a significantly low IQ, and his performance deserves a thumbs up.Prisoners is not always an easy watch, but that does take away from how powerful and uncompromising it is. It is an outstanding achievement by Denis Villenueve that deserves your attention, though perhaps not for those who are unwilling to take a journey through the dark pits of child abduction and vigilantism. Nonetheless, it is an engrossing experience that packs a punch.",9,1,2,5 October 2015
Silence," Harrowing and complex religious epic brands a superb cinematic work by Martin Scorcese
","'Sometimes silence is the deadliest sound' marks the uncompromising tagline of this religious epic directed by the hands of Hollywood mogul Martin Scorcese. This film is perceived as Scorcese's passion project, a cinematic translation of the acclaimed novel by Shusako Endo, which he's tried almost three decades trying to lift off the ground before finally landing it just in time for Oscar season. The historical epic paints a harrowing of the journey following Catholic priests venturing into a foreign country where spirituality comes at a great cost and religious rights are stripped away by the hands of tyrant individuals who spit in the face of religion. What Scorcese's long, complex testament comes down to is a harrowing and realistic tale that feels largely relevant to today's era, particularly when you examine the ongoing cultural conflicts erupting around the world as shown in the media. For many people, it hits awfully close to home. Set in the 17th century, this film follows Portuguese Catholic priests Father Rodrigues (played by Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (played by Adam Driver) who are informed by Father Alessandro Valignano (played by Ciaran Hinds) of the news of Father Ferreira (played by Liam Neeson) captured in Japan and denouncing his faith in a public. Out of curiosity to this rumor, Rodrigues and Garupe travel to Japan where they witness mass persecution against Christians at the hands of Inoue Masashige (played by Issey Ogata). In an efforts to locate Father Ferreira and propagate Christianity, Rodrigues and Garupe are placed in a harrowing battle of wills against the Japanese tyrant that will place their faith to a test.Although this doesn't mark Martin Scorcese's first time tackling on the topic of religion as his first adventure in this subject was 'The Last Temptation of Christ', this film does not draw a biblical portrait of the days of Jesus. Instead, it explores a powerful testament on how Christian missionaries have experienced challenges where their spirituality is battered and used as a weapon against them by nihilists who view religion as a philosophical hoax. And with an inspiring screenplay by co-written by Jay Cooks, stunning cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto (who's collaborated with Martin Scorcese for a second time following 'The Wolf of Wall Street') to capture the overwhelming atmosphere, and an overall enchanting direction; Scorcese paints an emotionally (and visually) arresting picture on two Catholic's priests' journey to spread of God while fighting against the mass persecution in a world where religion is outlawed and flushed from society. The story is very gut-wrenching and very complex, but also very slow. The plot moves in a leisurely pace that is enough to drive impatient viewers into utter boredom. But those who sustain their wills of sitting through the sluggish narrative are offered into a captivating story of pain, loss, hope, and redemption; and Martin Scorcese rarely pulls any punches when igniting the story is life. It is a depressing journey, but unfortunately it is still true to this day.Since his debut in the cinematic spotlight, Martin Scorcese never an immersive cast of widely acclaimed actors for granted. Stepping into the lead role of Father Rodrigues is Andrew Garfield. With his 'Spiderman' two years in the rearview mirror, Garfield has taken the advantage of the opportunities to explore more grounded roles outside the superhero genre as well as his acclaimed role in 'The Social Network'. Garfield plays the role of a determined Catholic priest who's forced to face the brooding reality of Japan in a society where Christianity is a contraband philosophical being. By the hands of a brutal Japanese authority officer, Rodrigues is trapped into a tense, psychological battle that challenges his spirituality and pits him with a tough decision between standing up for his beliefs and witnessing poor civilian followers being slaughtered, or shout against his faith to save their lives as well as his own. Similarly in Mel Gibson 'Hacksaw Ridge' in which he played another religiously-defined character, Garfield delivers a solid portrayal of this role. Although he evokes occasional hiccups in his Portuguese accent, it is difficult to deny the powerful gravitas he pours into the role. Adam Driver is also very stringent in his role as Rodrigues's accomplice as his Liam Neeson has the emotionally broken Father Ferreira who shares much less than a handful of screen time throughout the near three-hour run. Japanese actor Issey Ogata successfully unleashes a frightening, if somewhat humane portrayal as Inoue Masashige, the cruel mastermind behind the savagery against the Christian community.Silence is a harrowing and complex religious epic that marks an enthralling piece of cinematic work by Martin Scorcese in a departure from his typical violent mobster crime genre. Needless to say, this is not a film that is likely to convince those who are non-believers to convert to Christianity (or at least that is not Martin Scorcese is aiming for), it is a captivating picture that marks a good recommendation for both sides of the religious compass. In conclusion, it stands high as one of the best films of 2016.",9,5,11,21 January 2017
Logan," Gritty, visceral, and emotionally stunning, Logan is an astonishing superhero entry that really packs the punch
","Since the inaugaration of the X-men franchise back in 2000, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine has always stood as a compelling force to be reckoned with in the superhero. He is not firmly your average superhero, he is a hero with true grit and compulsion. Over the years, Wolverine has evolved into a powerful character aching with tragedy and sorrow similar to Batman from the DC universe. Although the iron-claw-wielding mutant has had more than his fair share of time to shine as a visceral cinematic figure, the X-Men franchise has never exercised his true, but gritty spirit to the fullest extent like Christopher Nolan did with Batman in the 'Dark Knight' trilogy...until now. Diving deep into the heart of the titular hero, this film journeys far into the grittier territory of the X-Men universe with a story tackling on complex themes of morality and sorrow that's plagued the inner being of the lead hero. And returning to the director's chair is James Mangold who last directed 2013's 'Wolverine'. Set in 2029, almost the entire mutant race has been wiped and one of the last remaining of the kind is Logan (played by Hugh Jackman). Retired from his glory days, Logan is now living in isolation caring for a dying 90-year old Charles Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart). When he's unexpectedly introduced to a young Latina girl named Laura (played by Dafne Keen) who happens to carry the same claw-wielding powers as him, he and Xavier must escort to safety. Pursuing after them are sadistic forces lead by half-human, half-robot Donald Pierce (played by Boyd Holbrook) who is set out to kill the young girl.Here marks a major turning point for the X-Men franchise, and arguably one for the superhero genre. As this entry follows a much darker and somber story than the previous installments, it also strays away from the more family-friendly conventions of the both the franchise and the genre itself. Following the success of the R-rated 'Deadpool' which pushed the boundaries with over-the-top violence and sexually crude material, this one adopts an R-rating as opposed to the previous installments which housed a more friendly PG-13 rating. So this time around, when Wolverine hacks his enemies with those sharp metal claws of his, the results are much more gruesome and realistic than what we were accustomed to (let's not forget the four-letter words). While the bloody imagery may come as an objection to some viewers with a weak stomach (along with a small detriment to the box office), it allows the film to exercise to true and more devastating nature of the aching hero. The story introduces Logan as an aged hero is know devastated by the tragedy that put an end to his glory days, and a man strangled by an enemy he can't seem to defeat, his tragic past. The plot then carries out the relationship between him and a young girl with powers he knows little about, evolving into more of an atmospheric character study than a plot-driven story. Director James Mangold effectively builds on the nature of the fatigued character with rigid melancholy many superhero flicks have lacked over the past several years. To add to the spice, Mangold executes the story in the style that echoes the old western outlaw movies with a post-apocalyptic environment and criminal themes playing major roles in many scenes. Although the story meanders a little in the midsection, Mangold is very solid at keeping things moving.Hugh Jackman has always stood as the show-stealer in the X-Men franchise with his portrayal as Wolverine/Logan. Unlike the previous entries, this film packs a punch with strong emotional grit and atmosphere that allows Jackman to exercise a more poignant performance than what he's demonstrated in the past. Jackman nicely knocks the ball out of the park with a somber performance as the titular character, a performance that also marks his final portrayal in the role before retiring as the iconic hero. Along his side, the only supporting to make his return from the previous entries is Charles Xavier whose role is proudly reprised by Patrick Stewart. With the aged Xavier know handicapped without his ability to walk, Stewart gives a blissful, if occasionally humorous portrayal as this signature role. Coming along for the ride is a young newcomer Dafne Keen who steps into the role of the mysterious young Laura born with a same clawing-wielding gift as Wolverine. Cashing in only little dialogue beyond a series of screams and occasional Spanish-spoken lines, her performance is displayed largely during the action sequences as we watch her slice and dice through the enemies in a violent, but dazzling fashion. While her performance stands strong, it is the subtly in which the character that makes her stand out.Logan is astonishing superhero entry that packs a powerful punch with its gripping narrative and direction that defies the usual superhero conventions. It is an emotionally riveting that not only transcends the genre but serves as a spectacular sendoff to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine with results that are vastly satisfying.",9,5,12,4 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The Avengers: Age of Ultron is pure awesome
","I remember seeing the first Avengers in theaters three years ago at a midnight screening and I was utterly impressed. That was definitely one of the best films I saw that year. Today, I hit the theaters to see The Avengers: Age of Ultron, and I was pretty ecstatic. While the first one was just a slight bit better, this one was quite entertaining. I enjoyed the characters, I enjoyed the story, and the action scenes were just awesome. Probably one of the best films I have seen this year.....so farOur favorite superheros: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, and Black Widow return, along with newcomers, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, in an epic fight to save the world. When Iron Man builds a peacekeeping program that goes terribly wrong, the avengers must fend off against the evil villain it becomes, Ultron. The action sequences were great, especially the intense battle at the end. The story was pretty good as well, thought not quite as good as the story in the first one. I do, however, love how the story takes a darker turn over from the first story. I thought I was pretty interesting. On the other hand, I was a little more entertained by Loki from the first film than Ultron in this one. I found Loki to better villain. Overall, I had a great time watching this, I was not disappointed by this. It was highly entertaining and , at times, very funny. I love how the characters throw out their hilarious one-liners here and there. This is a movie that everyone should go see!!",9,10,26,3 May 2015
The Dark Knight," Enthralling and ambitious on both a narrative and directorial scope, The Dark Knight is a stunning spectacle that transcends the comic book genre
","The Dark Knight marks not just a stunning follow-up to the successful Batman Begins, it is a landmark achievement on the comic book genre as a whole. Visionary filmmaker Christopher Nolan returns to the director's chair with an astounding continuation of the Batman Saga, a story that raises the stakes on the titular cape crusader in more ways than one. In an age when Hollywood has occasionally struggled to adapting superheroes on screen to their faithful roots, the iconic bat hero has never seen an outing for faithful than this one. Raising themes on moral complexity and psychological corruption, this groundbreaking sequel pits Batman in a battle against a threat that is not only more powerful, but much more personal than we have seen in the cinematic realm. And that threat is the iconic clown Joker who is blessed a shocking portrayal by Heath Ledger who was unfortunately unable to see the final results after his death of a drug overdose in January 2008. Set after the events of the first film, this movie follows Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale) is set to settle down after eliminating the threat of Gotham that was Scarecrow. Jim Gordon (played by Gary Oldman) is back as a police lieutenant and Harvey Dent (played by Aaron Eckhart) is running as Gotham's district attorney, trying to formulate a plan to ride the city of crime. When a sinister clown only known as the Joker (played by Heath Ledger) arises from the mysterious criminal underworld and begins to wreck havoc on Gotham on a grand scale, Bruce must suit up as Batman and cross the line between hero and vigilante to bring down what maybe the Gotham's greatest threat yet. As the chaos grows deeper, Batman find himself questioning his morals every step of the way. Christopher Nolan holds no bars when placing the iconic hero on the tension plate. This film is much darker and more poignant than what many fans of the popular source material have experienced in the past. Written by Nolan and his younger brother Jonathan Nolan and David S. Goyer, the story here approaches the cape crusader with complex themes including testing one's morality and battling against inner demons that threaten to destroy you in the process of making sacrifices. The new threat among Gotham is The Joker who is granted with a more sinister portrayal than what we have seen previously in the celluloid. The monstrous clown explodes on screen with an expertise of robbing banks, blowing up building including hospitals into smithereens, and launching a mass rebellion that places the law enforcement in grave danger. And sadly more Gotham, that is just the beginning. His terrifying wave of chaos not only puts Batman's loved ones in danger, but places him in under psychological torture that leaves him questioning if he is even a real hero or not. The question lies within the citizens and law enforcement of Gotham as well, particularly Harvey Dent who sermonizes 'You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become a villain.' The suspense is high, the atmosphere strikes directly at the heart, and the action, particularly the truck chase sequence, makes for some sweet visual candy; thanks in part to Wally Pfister who captures the action diligently. And you can always count on Hans Zimmer to endorse the grim atmosphere with an arresting score. Congratulations to you Zimmer!Christian Bale blessed us with a beautiful portrayal of Batman/Bruce Wayne in the predecessor, and now he has returned and is good as ever. Replacing Katie Holmes in the well-acted, but shoddily written role of Rachel Dawes is Maggie Gyllenhaal. The actress excels in a role that is suitably expand upon her previous outing, allowing her with more to work with than what Holmes is given. Her character is nicely explored in a subplot involving a love triangle between Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent that plays out well rather than hammy. Aaron Eckhart eclipses the role of Harvey Dent, Gotham's district attorney who sees on a dark soul inside Batman and questions his role as a hero. When Batman is force to make an unsettling sacrifice, Dent's lines between good and evil to grow muddy. The actor proves he is know how to strike at the heart in his performance which transcends during a gut-wrenching climax at the end. Gary Oldman and Michael Caine are good as Jim Gordon and Alfred respectively. Morgan Freeman is well, but nothing much to speak of. Without the the shiniest gem in the crowd is, of course, Heath Ledger igniting the role as The Joker. Injecting abundance of ferocity and grit into the darkened iconic villain, Ledger breaths incredible life into the villainous role, one that allows him to expand upon his acting range at shocking proportions. With the nefarious clown burning with insanity and injecting just a small dose of dark humor, if you find yourself giggling just a little bit, chances are it is an uncomfortable giggle. His spellbinding portrayal of The Joker operates the driving force of the film. It is such a shame that Ledger lost his life before being able to see the astonishing gold we left on in his performance.The Dark Knight is an enthralling, complex, and brutally ambitious rendition of the iconic DC hero that not only boasts the talent of both Christopher Nolan and the cast, but marks an exhilarating game changer on the comic book genre. It transcends the genre in an awarding fashion that results in what could easily be the greatest superhero flick ever to hit theaters. It is not just an exciting experience, it is a powerful one that feels quite personal.",10,0,0,20 July 2017

From the moment when the characters embark on their expedition on the mountain, you are left with your heart beating rapidly and your hands gripping your seats. This is greatly done by the amazing cinematography as we are treated with downward shots showing the depths of the canyons in the mountain and bird's eye views of the mountains. In the scene when the blizzard hits, the amount of suspense soars as we watch the characters suffer through harsh conditions. They run low on oxygen, suffer from hypothermia, and struggle through devastating winds, some of which fall to their deaths. One scene shows a graphic shot of a character's frostbitten hands. These scenes are shot so authentically and are tough to watch at times. You could literally feel the pain these characters are facing -- the freezing temperatures, the flying specks of snow hitting their faces. Then there is the cast who do such amazing jobs for their performances, although you do not learn much of the character other than Josh Brolin and Jason Clark's characters, but honestly it doesn't too much here.Everest is one of the most intense and fascinating disasters films I have seen in recent years. I believe with this film has a great chance at earning some Oscars for its technical achievements such as film editing, sound editing, and cinematography. This is a film I encourage to watch. If you have an IMAX theater nearby, watch this there, it would an amazing experience.",9,1,2,26 September 2015
Selma," Great movie with genuine performances
","This academy award nominated drama set during the 1964 civil rights movement is truly entertaining and one of the best films of 2014. This film not only boasts a strong cast and performances but gives a realistic showcase of the events that took place during the civil rights movement. In some scenes, it will have you cheering for the bravery of the characters and in other scenes it will leave you have you in shock. Overall, Selma is pure entertainment.Selma follows the story of Martin Luther King, played by David Oyelowo, and his effort on garnering equal rights for African Americans. His efforts however, put the lives of people around him in danger. David Oyelowo's performance as King was amazing and definitely 'Oscar material'. I love scenes when King was speaking in front of everyone, his speeches were inspiring and interesting to listens to. The best scene is the march in Montgomery and the police attacks that it leads to. The scene was so realistic and probably the most powerful scene in the movie. I recommend this movie to everyone.",9,1,2,8 February 2015
La La Land," Electrifying, charming, and swelling with vibrant performances, La La Land is a true cinematic masterpiece
","In the age of countless romantic films lacking originality and falling victim to tiresome formula, Damien Chazelle, the intelligent mind behind the exhilarating music-theme drama 'Whiplash' in 2014, makes a return to the director's seat to deliver arguably one of the most sensational romantic tales in recent years 'La La Land'. Crafted in a style of an old romantic film-noir from the 1950s through slick editing and vibrant storytelling, this film shines with the powerful cinematic appeal of actress Emma Stone and supporting actor Ryan Gosling, both of whom blossom on screen in a romance that not only feels original, it almost magical in every sense. It is sweet, it's sexy, and most importantly vastly unpredictable. And if the cast performances and sensational musical numbers tightly grips your attention, Damien Chazelle also has a sweet appetite for visual storytelling; an aspect this film greatly embraces. Set in modern day Los Angeles, this follows Mia (played by Emma Stone), a struggling actress who crosses paths with a passionate jazz pianist Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling). As the two bond and a boiling romance develops between them, their separate careers grow further and further in the entertainment industry which puts a rift on their relationship.Damien Chazelle effectively breathes life into the romance genre, operating on both narrative and technical elements have been abandoned since the Golden Age of Hollywood back in the 50s. Opening up with a vibrant musical number on a crowded highway, this film mixes elements of classic musicals with a gripping love story that gracefully comes to life on both a narrative and visual scope. The pinnacle to the film is a love story between two individuals of different backgrounds who grow further and further in love and before too long, are progressively drawn into each other's remarkable world. And rather driving the story on overbearing melancholy, Chazelle proceeds the story through a sense a humanity and spirit without feeling the need to rely on redundant formula. To add icing on the cake, the film expresses a sense of spirit and sensation through a series of musical numbers that are not only evoke nostalgia of classic 50s musicals but play out very provocatively. During these scenes, we are introduced to both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's surprising singing abilities arguably very few knew they've processed. And these scenes blossom with beautiful cinematography by Linus Sandgren (of David O. Russell's 'Joy' and 'American Hustle') who strives to not only capture the energy of these of the duo's lively performances but also the colorful palette of nighttime Los Angeles and the character's outfits.Emma Stone and Ryan Goslings are both the apex of the picture, and explode on screen with performances that can only be described as mesmerizing; and even that sounds like an understatement. Emma Stone who rose to Oscar territory with her performance in the Oscar-winning picture 'Birdman', shines her light with charm and vibrancy in her role. And the biggest surprise comes not only from her ability to drown herself in a dramatic characterization but also with her lively singing ability which she displays on screen a good number of sequences. Down-to-Earth and swarming with humanity, Stone breathes life into her character. Working along her side is co-star Ryan Goslings who steps in the shoes with her romantic partner Sebastian, a jazz musician with a passion to igniting a future for jazz music and disillusioned by the fading light the classic music genre has evolved in America's culture. When he crosses paths with Emma Stone's Mia, he almost desperately tries to his artful world upon learning of her lack of appeal in the classic style of music. His performance along with his singing ability is a thing of beauty, and by far the most enthralling performance he's ever ignited in this career. The chemistry these two share is brought by Damien Chazelle's engrossing direction which renders their romantic spark simply irresistible, even during long periods without them on screen together. The romance between these characters never feels contrived or hokey but thoroughly uncompromising.La La Land is an electrifying romantic masterpiece swelling with vibrant performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, and best of all boasts an outstanding directorial exertion from Damien Chazelle. Furthermore, it ignites life into a dimming romantic genre. In a stunning conclusion, La La Land takes a soft spot as one of the best films of 2016.",10,5,11,16 January 2017
Super 8," A dazzling science-fiction spectacle blooming with stunning special effects and enthralling Spielberg nostalgia
","J.J Abrams's Super 8 is not just a film that feasts the eyes with chord-striking special effects and visuals, it is also a love letter to the nostalgic days of Steven Spielberg classics such as'E.T: The Extra Terrestrial' and 'Close Encounters of The Third Kind'. This investment is greatly paid by the collaboration of visionary director Abrams and acclaimed Hollywood mogul Steven Spielberg who serves as the producer behind this summer spectacle. Channeling with both emotionally resonating storytelling and a powerful surplus of visuals that echoes the style of the aforementioned films, the influence of Spielberg's works definitely bleeds through. Although Abrams incorporates plenty of elements that defuse it's originality, it is difficult not to admire what a dazzling vision he delivers in this science-fiction piece. Set in 1979 in a fictional town of Lillian, Ohio, this film focuses on 14-year old Joe Lamb (played by Joel Courtney), a young lad coping with the loss of his mother who was killed in a train accident. With his relationship with his deputy father Jackson (played by Kyle Chandler) grown distant, Joe escapes his grief by filming monster movies with his friends Charles (played by Riley Griffiths), Cary (played by Ryan Lee), Martin (played by Gabriel Basso), and Preston (played by Zach Mills). Later joining the group is Alice Dainard (played by Elle Fanning) who's mother was also killed in the accident. While filming their Super 8 film at an abandoned train station, the children witness a horrific train crash that not devastates the train station, but leads to some unnatural events that begin to threaten the town.The leverage of Steven Spielberg's classic works is greatly sprinkled throughout the picture, from the emotionally stimulating narrative, to the eye-striking scenery. Abrams and Spielberg both effectively captures the innocence of childhood through the story that not only echoes the vibrant atmosphere of 'E.T' but also their passion of filmmaking that grew on them as children. The premise follows the lead character as he escapes into a world of filmmaking in the wake of the tragedy that struck him and his father, and emotional tax it puts on their relationship serves as the emotional crux of the story. He ends up finding levity in making short films with his rag-tag team of friends who's fun in greatly disrupted by when a bombastic train crash, a scene that kicks off the movie's special effects mayhem. With train cars blowing up and crashing in every direction, this scene not only exhibits Abrams's astonishing talent for effects but sets the whole mystery plot in motion for the terrifying chaos that is about to come. As the story advances, chaos lurks throughout the picture, and Abrams successfully delivers a hodgepodge of suspense-ridden thrills and stimulating visuals that keeps the story moving. In the final act, which pays a heavy homage to one of Spielberg's most acclaimed films, Abrams's visionary style greatly pays off. While some may argue that the film towers nostalgia over substance and plot, it is hard to ignore the ambition that Abrams brings to the table. As for the performances, the young actors do a swell job in their roles as do the adults in their slightly more minor roles, none of which truly stand out. Super 8 is a dazzling science-fiction spectacle that grips with exhilarating special effects, visual imagery, and an emotionally touching narrative that strikes at the heart. Most importantly, the film also makes an enthralling achievement at reminding people what it was like to be child. In conclusion, this cinematic achievement inspires hope for another Abrams/Spielberg collaboration.",9,1,3,6 April 2017
Snowden," Oliver Stone's political biopic offers plenty of substance, but nothing remarkable
","Oliver Stone has a solid history of projects centering on controversial political subjects, dating back to his Vietnam War epic 'Platoon' in 1986. Though Stone has gotten share of formulating notorious events to life to the big screen, his latest project revolving on the controversial story of Edward Snowden, a former computer systems analyst who sparked a breakthrough in national security in June of 2013; proves that some stories don't translate well for on screen adaptation, at least not in the non-documentary territory. This biopic telling the story of the titular figure may offer plenty of knowledge leading up to the fateful moment that made global headlines along with some thought-provoking concepts about privacy and cyber security. Unfortunately, the film never reaches much depth beyond dragging us through a sluggish pace of humdrum storytelling, nor does it hit any dynamic roots that could have made for a more enthralling story. This film follows the true story of CIA agent Edward Norton (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who makes an disconcerting discovery of the government's collection of data containing communication info owned by every living individual around the globe, not limited foreign government or international terrorists. Upon this discovery, he gathers all the classified information he can get his hands on and leaks them online, leading to a massive controversy that made him a target by not the U.S government, but foreign government around the world as well. Like many of Oliver Stone's projects, the film offers plenty of politically-charged commentary to the mix with plenty of scenes featuring protests against Iraq War and George W. Bush's presidency, the 2008 election of President Obama and his testimonies on homeland security; plenty of food for thought is thrown at the table. But when it comes to telling the story of Edward Snowden, the man who some called a 'hero' while others condemned him as a 'traitor' or a 'criminal', that is where Oliver Stone's efforts falter. The storyline is intertwined by scenes of the titular character at a hotel in Hong Kong being interviewed by a documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras (who happened to direct the documentary 'Citzen Four -- centering on Edward Snowden) and The Guardian publisher Glenn Greenwald, played by Melissa Leo and Zachary Quinto respectively. This is where we are let in on the events leading up to the critical event including his days working for the CIA, his pervasive paranoia upon discovering the massive mountain of communication surveillance held by the government, and his relationship with his girlfriend Lindsay Mills (played by Shailene Woodley). Throughout this time, the film feels the need to burn through nearly every single detail of Snowden's life including those of the least relevance; and what results is a sluggish pace of a story that's not as effective as it could have been. While there at least some fine tension in showcasing Snowden's paranoia against the government's access of private online information as well as credible performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Shailene Woodley, Oliver Stone executes the story in a way that just isn't too effective or memorable. Though he manages to incorporate some engrossing concepts into the mix, his attempt on sustaining the story through a 134- minute don't quite come as satisfactory as it should have been.Snowden is an average biopic that manages to display some fine performances by a likable cast and some moments of interest and substance surrounding it's controversial figure. Sadly, the film never rises to potential, nor does it make for a memorable portrait of the titular figure.",6,3,10,18 September 2016
A Clockwork Orange," An ultra-violent, but riveting Stanley Kubrick classic with a strong societal message
","Stanley Kubrick has proved himself a highly influential filmmaker in the face of Hollywood, and when it comes to hitting major topics to the silver screen, he does not mess around. Blessing Hollywood with a long series of cinematic gems until his death in the late 90s, Kubrick has succeeded above the surface level when covering big topics such as politics, war, crime, and science-fiction (2001: A Space Odyssey). This early 70s dystopian thriller A Clockwork Orange made an enthralling commentary on violence and juvenile delinquency. The film garnered a fair amount of controversy for its graphic portrayal of violence and sexual mistreatment, initially landing it an X rating. Before too long, gained a major cult status to where it was named one of Stanley Kubrick's best work by many. Set in futuristic Britain, the film follows Alex DeLarge (played by Malcolm Dowell), a sadistic teenager with a love for violence, sex, and classic music by Ludwing Van Beethoven. He is the leader of a sociopathic gang of his friends Dim (played by Warren Clark), Georgie (played by James Marcus), and Pete (played by Michael Tarn) who commit series of vicious crimes around town including beatings and sexual assault. Upon killing a cat lady, his friends abandon him on the scene leading to the authorities to catch him and throw him in prison. During his prison sentence, Alex grows ashamed by his petty ways and volunteers to undergo a psychological treatment that will not only render him 'good' but also reduce his prison sentence. Upon being released, Alex tries adjusting to his new life, only to witness his violent past becoming back haunt him. Stanley Kubrick's unique flair shines clear in this dystopian thriller, from the astounding cinematography, to the dazzling production design, to the magnetic storytelling based on the acclaimed novel by Anthony Burgesa. This movie shows Kubrick at one of his best, if not on the level of '2001: A Space Odyssey'. There is also no doubt however, that this is darkest picture yet, supplementing violent and lurid material that's destined to make even the most desensitized viewers uncomfortable. The film opens with the main character Alex filling the screen with an unsettling smirk to give viewers to clear implication of his dark nature. Associated with this scene is a loud, lurid music score by Walter Carlos to deliver a disorienting feel of what audience should be prepared for. Following the opening scene is the first fourteen minutes of Alex and his gang unleashing their unspeakable on innocent victims. There is a beating, a rape, and the infamous 'Singing In The Rain' sequence. Instead of portraying the characters as outright evil however, Kubrick illustrates the characters as teenagers with a very dark sense of humor who know their petty crimes are harmful but simply must be done because a society without crime not normal, according to them. Though these scenes aren't pretty to watch, they are gifted by a decent cinematography by John Alcott who's a Stanley Kubrick veteran since his first collaboration in '2001'.Over the decades, Alex DeLarge has grown to be a highly memorable figure and this all thanks to not only Stanley Kubrick's captivating script but Malcolm Dowell's genuine performance. Dowell shows off a grueling and highly realistic vibe as the main character, the fact that Dowell walked away with no even an Oscar nomination remains quite a mystery. If his dark portrayal doesn't give chills down your spines, I don't know what will. Arguably the strongest aspect of the picture though, comes from the plot development. Tackling on themes of juvenile delinquency and crime against society, the plot endures stringent commentary on the impacts of violence. By no means, it does little to hold back. From beginning to end, the film journeys through the main character's sadism and follows through the consequences that he endures when he attempts to rehabilitate himself from his sadistic demeanor. To that point, the film grants some twists and surprises to channel an unpredictable (and deeply disturbing) tale. The film could have taken a more happy route by chroniclizing Alex readjusting to his home life and teaching his fellow others his new, wholesome ways, but then it would result in a plot much less meaningful and no surprises.A Clockwork Orange is a ultra-violent, but riveting Stanley Kubrick picture that serves a definition of the filmmaker that makes Kubrick the smart, influential director he turned out to be. As being one of his most acclaimed films, this movie is worth watching for film buffs but the dark, violent, and disturbing content that pervades the picture is enough to warrant only a single viewing and likely discourage viewers from enduring a second viewing. This film is recommended but not for the faint of heart or anyone under the age of seventeen.",8,0,1,20 May 2016
The Fly," David Cronenberg crafts an incredibly gory, but ultimately effective science-fiction horror that works as a gut-punching scarefest
","David Cronenberg boasts a few top-notch tricks under his sleeve to pull off a reimagining of the 1958 original of the same name. For a director with an appealing pastiche of gruesome practical effects and ringing in an effectively grim atmosphere, Cronenberg crafts an astonishing rendition of a man who's human identity is slowly faded away by a scientific experiment gone horribly wrong. The Fly is not your standard horror picture boiled with vicious desires tingle with audiences' stomach with over-the-top gore and repulsiveness, it is one that carries a surprisingly gripping edge and journeys into an emotional territory that most horrors films hesitate to venture in. As disturbing and grotesque as it can get, it rarely pokes you with the feeling that Cronenberg believes that can filling the screen with stomach-turning gore is the only tool to leave you squirming in your seats. Of course, that is not to say it is a good idea to have lunch before sitting through this. This film places its focuses on eccentric scientist Seth Brundle (played by Jeff Goldblum) who hopes to revolutionize technology of his new teleportation machine, which he uses to grab the attention of a cute journalist Vanessa (played by Geena Davis). Determined to take his research one step further, Seth conducts an experiment where he steps into one of teleportation pods, unaware that a house fly has managed sneak into the other. Coming out the pod, Seth experiences bizarre and unsettling changes to his body as the fusion between him and the fly causes him to slowly morph into a hideous human-fly hybrid creature. David Cronenberg embraces his trademark grandeur of gruesome practical effects reminiscent to his previous works, and combines it with sharp precision of storytelling to conduct a brutally bleak horror tale that works in the fashion of a gripping human tragedy. Lead character Seth Brundle has met the love of his life and hopes to impress her with his outlandish research, but all goes wrong when a simple task leaves his man peeling away from the very identity that defines him. And if you think there is no room for an emotional human touch, think again, because Cronenberg places it at the heart of this bodily transformation plot. The story progresses with a menacing tone as the lead character watches as his body steadily deforms into a hideous figure complete with gritty-looking make-up and prosthetics while losing his limbs including his ears, and a sense of dread crowds the atmosphere as Seth sees his relationship with Vanessa deteriorating at the hands of his ugly bodily transformation that makes the Toxic Avenger look like a snuggle doll. And that is just part of how Cronenberg effectively breaths humanity into both Seth and Vanessa. It is an effective alternative element to the more common route of the monstrous villain hunting down victims and picking them of one by one. And this picture would not have worked as strongly without the performance by Jeff Goldblum who poses a convincing a normal human man morphing into less and less of a human. As for Geena Davis, there is no problem with giving her credit.The Fly is a gripping science-fiction horror picture bound with an astonishing human touch that renders the film drifting from your average horror movie conventions. Thanks to David Cronenberg, it works in more ways than what one might expect from an 80s gorefest. One thing is for sure though, it is definitely not for the faint of heart.",9,1,1,25 October 2017
Reservoir Dogs," Quentin Tarantino's mobster flick is very violent and bloody, but superbly entertaining
","Quentin Tarantino has scaled the ladder of Hollywood filmmakers since his directorial debut in 1992. With his unique style of filmmaking and writing, Tarantino has established himself as a masterful Hollywood mogul. Although his magnum opus 'Pulp Fiction' placed the director in the front ranks of Hollywood filmmakers, it was this brutal crime- drama that place Tarantino in the cinematic radar. Blossoming with a cutthroat script, audacious humor, and a masterfully artistic representation of violence, this mobster drama showcases the fine director's snappy filmmaking talent in arguably one of his most polishes forms yet. It is violent, it is brutal, and it is darkly funny in shocking ways. Most importantly, it is a raw gangster flick that pays a fair amount of homages to the classic film-noir genre of the 50s and 60s, and that is only half of what makes this movie subversively entertaining. This film stars Lawrence Tierney as Joe Cabot, a mob boss who hires a group of gangsters under the names Mr. White (played by Harvey Keital), Mr. Blonde (played by Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink (played by Steve Buscemi), Mr. Orange (played by Tim Roth), Mr. Brown (played by Quentin Tarantino), and Mr. Blue (played by Edward Bunker) to rob a jewelry store in attempt to their hands on some precious diamonds. When the robbery goes terribly wrong and Mr. Orange is severely wounded, the criminals grows suspicious each other, believing one of them is backstabbing traitor. From there on, tension rise to violent consequences.Tarantino supplies an incredible surplus of substance and flair in this violent 'whodunit' caper story. This film opens with a scene of our characters gathered up a diner where we are treated with a bold, yet darkly humorous introduction of the characters before they embark on their dangerous heist. When the heist turns to chaos and Tim Roth's character takes a bullet to the chest, that is when the plot kicks into gear. The driving force behind the plot is the visceral tension that grows between the characters as they each suspect that one of them is a mole. This soon accounts to a series of verbal spars supplemented with audacious dialogue and tension that leads to unpredictable bloodbaths. One scene in particularly involves a tied-up police officer who is unfairly treated to one of the cruelest (and most graphic) methods of torture ever put to screen. With the most of the action taking place in an abandoned warehouse, the violent tension greatly builds up to the shocking climax which demonstrates the nihilistic nature of the characters. While things go escalate far into mean-spirited territory that can e uncomfortable for the weak stomach, Tarantino never attempts to dive into the realm of exploitation. Although the none of the characters are particularly likable for their obvious moral depravity and ruthless personalities, Tarantino does a fairly decent job at keeping the characters interesting. The cast of made of a roster of inspiring actors who exhibit incredible performances that make a good equation of the characters' memorability. Lawrence Tierney as the mob boss and Chris Penn as his son deliver strong performances for their limited time on screen. Acquiring the most screen time is Harvey Keitel who demonstrates plenty of grit and energy in his role. The same can be mentioned for Steve Buscemi who takes a stab at some bold humor, mostly during the opening scene in the diner. Tim Roth gives a solid performance for a role that restrains him to lying in a pool of blood after his suffers a bullet wound. He does a marvelous job at displaying a realistic sense of agony for someone who's met the wrong end of a firearm. Michael Madsen is steals the show with his sadistic role as the mean-spirited member of the group who takes a cringe-inducing joy in sadism, particularly in one scene. Then there is Edward Bunker and Quentin Tarantino himself -- both of whom share a very limited amount of screen time but nonetheless make good work of the small roles they are pitted with. It is hard to say whether any of these performances are Oscar-worthy, but for they these actors accomplish, they will keep your eyes glued to the screen.Reservoir Dogs is a raw, violent, and bloody crime thriller that is superbly entertaining from start to finish, and displays Quentin Tarantino operating at one of his finest forms yet. With no surprise, this film is highly unlikely to be a welcoming experience for those who can't stomach blood-spewing violence and gleeful profanity. For everyone else, this is an entertaining picture for the crime genre.",9,0,1,7 March 2015
Don't Breathe," Don't watch alone
","Director Fede Alvarez demonstrated some potent skills in 2013 remake of Sam Raimi's classic 'Evil Dead', showing an solid balance of over-the-top gore and spine-chilling scares. Though the dark humor factor from Sam Raimi's entry was mostly absent, it not only made for an astoundingly terrifying experience from beginning to end, but fostered strong nightmarish visuals that made Sam Raimi's installment a true scare fest. This gripping thriller sees Fede Alvarez continuing his journey of brood, white-knuckle thrills with a brilliantly crafted plot and nightmarish atmosphere that is bound to leave even the bravest of the bunch leaning at the edge of their seats. While the movie isn't terribly original or groundbreaking in any sense, it knows how to deliver the scares effectively and smartly. This film follows three teenagers: Alex (played by Dylan Minnette), Rocky (played by Jane Levy), and her boyfriend Money (played by Daniel Zavotto), growing up in the poor streets of Detroit, who make money off of committing robbery hoping to make enough money to leave town and move to California. When they across an old rundown house, they not only discover it's holding of a $300,000 cash donation he received following the death of his daughter but learn the house is owned by an old blind Vietnam War veteran (played by Stephen Lang). Using his blindness as a perfect opportunity, the trio breaks in to and take a run for the money. Unfortunately, they learn the man is not as helpless as he appears and soon pitted in a violent fight for survival.If you are someone who is easily scared in horror flicks, then you are in for a perfect treat because this one 88-minute piece almost never lets you rest easy; especially when sitting under the loud surround sound at the theaters. From the opening minutes of the robbery to the end, this film pits you in a dark, eerie atmosphere where suspense is around every corner and not limited to an ominous music score to tune up the suspense. And the scariest part is it takes almost entirely in one house, and mostly during the nighttime. The suspense is generated not through the effective lighting, but also with a powerful music score by Roque Banos. The music score is effective at capturing the sheer intensity of the scenes during the the characters' encounters with the old man. But the films is quite fair at not overlying on the ominous music to keep the suspense in tune, and thanks to Fede Alavarez's strong execution some of the scares work even without support of the heavy music. A good example lies in a scene the living room when the characters try to escape from the old man (who's blind) but must overcome the creepiness of the floorboards that disturb hearing. The man's ability of head comes to a great advantage above his lack of sight in many scenes. There's over a handful of jump scares that come when you least expect it, some of which involve a vicious dog; and plenty of scenes destined to make viewers with claustrophobia uncomfortable. From the frightening visuals and low lighting, these scenes are deeply unnerving, but definitely not without the solid performances by Dylan Minnette, Jane Levy, and Daniel Zovatto. These three are undeniably convincing in their roles and make for some interesting characters. While these characters are a bit gray in the moral compass that makes some a little hard to root for, they are always interesting and never too short of humanity. Stephen Lang is also solidly convincing, if a bit off-putting in the antagonist role. Though it doesn't have a whole lot other than a dozen lines, his portrayal of the disturbed tyrant figure is not easy to ignore.Don't Breath is easily the best and most scary film of the year so far, and it definitely shows director Fede Alvarez at the top of his game. This film is a must-watch for all horror fans, though it's not likely to go down as a classic; but safe to say it is close enough. If you see this movie, I strongly advise you bring a friend because watching this alone will probably not be an easy ride, but that is what makes this such an effective horror film.",9,5,12,4 September 2016
Sicario," Sicario really packs a punch
","This gritty, violent thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve, the mastermind behind 'Prisoners' and 'The Place Beyond The Pines' sets a grounded story during the U.S/Mexican drug wars heightened in the U.S border where crime against society runs dangerously rampant and drug cartels dominate the streets. The film places Emily Blunt in the role of Kate Mercer, an idealistic DEA agent who volunteers for an operation to infiltrate a Mexican drug cartel. Partnered up with veteran DEA agent Matt Graver (played by Josh Brolin) and Alejandro Wilson (played by Benicio Del Toro) who is seeking revenge for the murder of his wife and child, Kate travels through the brooding streets of El Paso in search of the cartel, only to witness harrowing events that while busting the suspects connected to the cartel. As Kate and her team dive deeper and deeper into the operation, she is faced with the grim reality of drug trafficking business and the complexities of capturing the cartel. As explained the title card during the opening credits, sicario is the Spanish word for hit-man. This thought-provoking thriller could be just your average action popcorn flick taxed with tense action sequences and special effects. However, it has a lot more thoughtful elements to bring to the table than flashy action set pieces; and it certainly digs deep. The film presses the story in the violent underworld of drug trafficking and the apparent corruption lead in the law enforcement, including characters who have blurred lines between right and wrong. This all begins with the opening scene set in Chandler, Arizona where a team of DEA agents are making a drug bust that results in an operation gone terribly wrong with innocent lives lost. Then there's a shot showing Emily Blunt's character in the shower washing off the blood resulted in the incident. These first ten minutes really set the tone of the film, and it gives a clear picture what the story will be diving into. From that point, the story focuses on the characters and their experiences drawing into the drug busting operation, and the scenes to follow get pretty violent and grim without being overly excessive. The characters are crucially developed and stand powerful throughout the picture, particularly Benicio Del Toro's character who is significantly complex, serves as a turning point for the story during its climax. Roger Deakins has been one of the most respected cinematographers in Hollywood, despite his lack of Oscar landings, and he delivers powerful cinematography this film. Each scene from start to finish to shot superbly and fits well with the atmosphere. The biggest gem comes with the characters driving through El Paso where we are treated sadistic views of the crime-ridden streets including four decapitated bodies hanging from an overpass and corpses mutilated and covered in blood. This scene is very difficult to look at, but makes crucial sense to the plot's dreary atmosphere. The performances are also quite the attention grabbers. Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro are both fantastic in their roles, and deserve immense amount of praise for their striving commitment they put in their characters. Sicario stands high as one of the best films of 2015 and perhaps, one of the best films of this decade so far. This film is exuberantly shot, very well acted, and paints an authentic picture of the reality of drug wars that go on in the U.S/Mexican border. Yes, the film is violent and difficult to watch at times, but at the same time, one that deserves your attention. It also shows a strong signal that director Denis Villenueve has a bright filmography ahead of him.",9,3,5,13 March 2016
Inside Man," Smart heist thriller puts Spike Lee in the spotlight
","Director Spike Lee gears up sheer suspense, a powerful plot, and a compelling, though slightly flawed screenplay by Russell Gewirtz of a bank robbery gone wrong in this heist thriller starring the stellar cast of frequent Spike Lee collaborator Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Chiwetel Eijiofor, and Jodie Foster. Owen plays Dalton Russell, a violent but intelligent criminal who orchestrates a bank heist at a local Manhattan bank that quickly turns into a high-stakes negotiation situation between detective Frazier (played by Denzel Washington), his partner Bill Mitchell (played by Chiwetel Eijiofor), Captain John Darius (played by William Dafoe) and high-powers broker Madeleine White (played by Jodie Foster) when Russell's comrades take the occupants hostage. With bank president Arthur Case (played by Christopher Plummer) vowing to protect a case containing secret war items and hostage pitted as suspects by the vicious bank robbers, the rookie detectives and the SWAT team are the only chances of bringing Russell and his comrades to justice and saving the hostages. However, as tensions heat up, the law enforcement learn that the criminals are not just after money, but an airplane. And the mystery is: what do they want it for?This heist film has plenty of smarts and elements that make up for a tense, compelling thriller with brooding suspense. Rather than focusing on violent shootouts and confrontations, this thriller leaves fair room for tense interrogations and political themes including war connections to war, while blending cohesive thrills and violence. One major subplot consists of bank president played by Christopher Plummer desperate to protect a briefcase filled with Nazi documents from World War II. References to 9/11 scares also come into play, with one of the suspects being Muslim leading to suspicion with the law enforcement. The biggest light however, comes from the tense atmosphere of the bank robbery. From the opening minutes of the fledging criminals' arrival, the film pits viewers with a strong plethora of thrills and suspense, with intersecting cuts to scenes of Denzel Washington and Chiwetel Eijiofor interrogating various hostages and suspects. Though the robbery scenes often consists of elements that strongly resemble those of the terrorist attack in 'Die Hard', there is plenty of edge-of-your-seat thrills to captivate viewers, while leaving others uncomfortable and disturbed by the robbers' sadism; although the main antagonist is not portrayed exactly as a vicious savage with bloodlust, but a man with a heart and humanity. The plot doesn't always have its novelty however. The film works well for the most of the first half, but eventually sprawls through some tonal inconsistencies during the second half. Overall, Director Spike Lee steers the film in the solid direction, even the plot slips off track towards its climax. After all, how hard is it to enjoy the genuine performances by the cast, especially Clive Owen who brings solid conviction to the the main antagonist. Inside Man is smart and compelling heist thriller, though it has a few flaws. It is a strong and compelling portrayal of the heist genre, and demonstrates the true vivids efforts by director Spike Lee. The film is certainly no classic nor does it try to be, but it is utterly intriguing.",8,1,2,17 April 2016
Pulp Fiction," Darkly funny genre-bending piece easily marks one of the best films of cinematic history
","Quentin Tarantino has taken a spot as one of the best and most influential directors of all time. Two years after his success with his debut film Reservoir Dogs, he took his director skills up to next level in this incredibly unique black comedy black comedy Pulp Fiction. Boasting a strong ensemble cast of actors including Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvey Keital, Uma Therman, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Maria De Medeiros, and Eric Stoltz; this bold genre-bending piece demonstrates Tarantino exercising his unique style of direction in arguably his most polished fashion yet. Told in a nonlinear perspective, this film follows three interconnecting story lines centering on a wide range of characters in their life of crime in the city of Los Angeles. Followed by a tense introduction of two restaurant robbers (played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer), we are introduced to two tuxedo-suited hit men Vincent Vega (played by John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (played by Samuel L. Jackson) as they make a hit for their mob boss Marcellis Wallace (played by Ving Rhames) that goes awry. This is followed by Vincent Vega on a platonic date with Marcellis's wife Mia (played by Uma Thurman), next storyline introduces us to a championship boxer Butch Coolidge (played by Bruce Willis) and his girlfriend Fabienne (played by Maria De Medeiros); followed by the aftermath of Vincent and Jules's mob hit where they meet with Jules' friend Jimmy (played by Quentin Tarantino himself) and Winston Wolfe (played by Harvey Keital) to help them out of their predicament. When it comes to writing sharp dialogue and a long range of exotically colorful characters, that is where director Quentin Tarantino's cinematic expertise shines the brightest. In other words, he proves more than capable of writing a finely masterful screenplay and translating on screen in the most engaging manner possible. Unlike this previous film 'Reservoir Dogs' which centered on a group of unhinged criminals in the aftermath of a jewelry store robbery, this film sees Tarantino expands upon his narrative scope with a slightly more lighthearted tone; though a relatively heavy amount of violence and four-letter words. The story sets in two hit-man played by former 'Grease' star John Travolta and the ever-popular Samuel L. Jackson as they are embark on their way to a mob hit while trading in some philosophical discussions consisting of clever pop culture references including the now-famous 'royale with cheese'. The rest of the dialogue consists of some snappy monologues and bold one-liners formulated by Tarantino's edgy script. Many of the characters, almost all of which are distinct archetypes with a morally gray area, embrace in Tarantino's nonlinear series of vignettes that all lead to moments of both shock and unexpected laughter, but with plenty of memorability. Among the wildly large ensemble cast, John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are easily the duo is stand out. These two embrace such an engaging chemistry on their opening scene with their top-notch dialogue and darkly funny nature, and Travolta also claims an opportunity to establish a clever chemistry with Uma Thurman in a following storyline featuring Eric Scholtz as a drug dealer who must come to Travolta's aid when his date with Thurman goes awry. Bruce Willis gives a smart, but perhaps less memorable performance as an ailing boxer who faces a fateful encounter with Marcellis Wallace, played by Ving Rhames who plays the role in a solid fashion. Christopher Walken makes a brief appearance as a Vietnam War veteran in a flashback sequence, but doesn't have much offer beyond his few minutes of screen time. Maria De Medeiros as the girlfriend of Bruce Willis's character embraces a fine performance, but sadly is given a whole lot to do. One of the biggest surprise is Quentin Tarantino who makes a brash cameo as a friend of Samuel L. Jackson in one vignette set after the horrible carnage that ensues in Jackson and Travolta's mob hit. Finally, there is Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer as the Bonnie and Clyde-like couple who explode on screen in an electrifying restaurant robbery leads to a sassy showdown, with semi-funny results. Pulp Fiction is a masterfully entertaining cinematic piece that marks not the best of Quentin Tarantino's efforts but by far one of the best films in cinematic history. It is a film overflowing with plenty of substance, solid performances, colorful dialogue, and a spectacular amount of cinematic surprises; although it's audacious humor and occasionally unpleasant nature can proved to be for offensive for some. In the end, it places Tarantino on the high ranks of Hollywood's ladder.",10,0,1,2 May 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Perhaps not as spectacular as the first entry, but nonetheless exciting, funny, and visually stimulating as it needs to be
","When Guardians of The Galaxy first hit the cinema multiplexes in the summer of 2014, it was a surprising success, especially for a superhero film based on comic books that very few knew about. Grossing around a quarter from crossing the billion-dollar mark, it was fairly predictable for a sequel to see the light of the day. This second installment, which helms director and writer James Gunn as the conductor, brings back our favorite heroes from the first film and places them in an all-new adventure. While this film made the score as a wild crowd-pleaser with its clever humor and tense, special-effects-laden galore, this one perhaps marks a just a slight stepback from its predecessor. Cutting back by a fraction on its zany, light-hearted tone in favor of deep character development and heart, this film delivers the fun and excitement with only a few flaws that go marginally noticeable. This film focuses on the Guardians: Peter Quill/Star Lord (played by Chris Pratt), Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), Drax (played by Dave Batista), and the now Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). The team travels to a distant planet where they come across a celestial named Ego (played by Kurt Russell) who happens to be Peter's long-lost father. The team soon sets out on an intergalactic adventure to discover the mysterious of Peter's strained past. Whereas the first installment ran off the chains with non-stop cheekiness and balls-to-the-walls humor, this movie takes a small step back to take a deep exploration into the characters, most particularly Peter Quill. This endeavor opens doors to a more powerful emotional core that taps into the heart strings. That is not the say the film does not leave any room for some light-hearted banter between the characters along with gut-busting one-liners. Although a small portion of the sexual innuendos tend to fall flat, the character certainly prove to be fighters for stealing the show from each other. The main driving force of the plot here is themes of family, that is where the dynamics of the father-son relationship between Peter Quill and Ego comes in. The story spends a portion of time diving into the relationship between Peter and his father, and what accounts is some emotionally resonating sequences that are surprisingly moving. But that is not all, the relationship Gamora and Nebula (played by Karen Gillian) is also greatly explored here, though perhaps not as ambitiously. The family dynamics result in numerous (and occasionally clunky) tonal shifts throughout the picture. Along the side, the film doesn't fail to fuel the adrenaline tank with visually stunning action sequences including spaceship battles and countless CGI explosions to keep things moving at a reasonable pace. And much like the previous movie, serving the backdrop of nearly every scene is a sweet classic 70s soundtrack to establish the cheeky mood of the story. The majority of the cast from the previous installment returns, each of them is good as ever. Chris Pratt, the likable guy he is, returns with a sheer amount of charisma and humor to his role. His humanistic performance serves as a supporting factor for his chemistry with new-face Kurt Russell who plays his father. The two share a strong emotional chemistry that greatly serves as a driving force the story. For fans of Russell, the actor never disappoints from his opening screen time, to the final act. Zoe Saldana is very strong in her role, boasting a fair amount of humanity with her emotional bond with Karen Gillian's Nebula. Bradley Cooper returns as the voice for the loud-bantering raccoon Rocket and continues to deliver one hilarious one-liner after another. Professional wrestler Dave Batista puts some great effort into the role of Drax, adding both humor and sentimental value to his already comedic figure. Groot who is now shrunk down to baby form is sustained by the voice of Vin Diesel who like the last film, never reaches a departure outside his signature lines 'I am Groot'. This little character is cute the second he appears on screen, and never fails to deliver the charm. Michael Rooker does his job as Yondu, another returning character. Sylvester Stallone makes a surprise appearance here as well, although his screen time is reduced to no longer than five minutes or so. Then there is Pom Klementieff as a telepathic mantis who swarms with a slice of humanity to her character, as well as a pinch of comedic chemistry with Dave Batista's Drax. If there is anything that chews at the clever chemistry between these characters, it is most likely the long separation between these characters with Peter, Gamora, and Drax spends a large amount of time on one planet, and Rocket and Groot on another, thus reducing the hilarious banter that contributes to these character's likability. Guardians of The Galaxy: Volume 2 is a fun follow-up to the 2014 original, with a fair amount of energy, heart, and humor to satisfy moviegoers of a various demographics. It's certainly not as polished as the previous entry, but that very little to bar from the insane amount of fun this movie is. This movie is an early summer blockbuster that is virtually impossible to doubt for reaching a phenomenal box office receipt by the end of the summer.",8,5,9,11 May 2017
Thor," For what Kenneth Branaugh accomplishes, Thor is a satisfying Marvel superhero tale of epic proportions
","Thor is an excitement-filled action adventure that competently puts the God of Thunder on the pedestal with flashy visual scope serving a warm welcome for another Marvel comics entry. Taking the director's chair is Kenneth Branaugh who takes the spirit of the titular hero and slaps it on screen with endearing charisma, and the results shine, though not in a way that breaths game-changer. As opposed to many heroes of the Avengers team, Thor is not your typical modern day hero. This hammer-wielding god combines average superhero elements and clashes them with the fantasy-esque world that bears reminiscence to Greek mythology. He is an inhabitant of a mystical world of unnatural wonders outside of Earth, and serves as the center of the story that draws small parallels to William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'. In some context, it is an superhero origin story that almost falls in the category of an epic, though perhaps that classification would be rooting too deep. This film is takes us in the distant world of Asgard, ruled by the mighty king Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins). Under his wing are his two sons Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston). As Odin prepares to crown the former as king, the realm becomes threatened by evil Frost Giants. Determined to protect his home, Thor goes against his father's orders and sets out to find against the evildoers. When his actions heightens a war between Asgard and the giants, Odin strips Thor of his powers and exiles him to Earth where he is forced to enlist the help of scientists Eric Slevig (played by Stellan Skarsgard) and Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman) and their intern Darcy Lewis (played by Kat Denning) to help regain his powers. Meanwhile, back on Asgard, Loki, jealous by his father's initial plans to choose Thor over him as the new ruler, hatches an evil plan of his own. Kenneth Branaugh crafts a refreshing picture of the titular Marvel comics star with solid precision, and from start to finish, never takes telling a compelling story for granted. The premise introduces the world of Asgard, warmed with dazzling CGI, and the characters very effectively, and once everyone steps into the action, the results pay off. The first special effects-laden sequence featuring Thor, Loki, and their fellow warriors battling against the Frost Giants not only satisfy with their effects glaze, but energetically set the story in motion following Thor's banishment from the home realm. His quest to regain his strength to fight against the evil that has threatened his home holds the most meant, but also lies a few of the narrative flaws. The story feels a bit rushed at times to the point where you hold the feeling that a half-hour of more runtime could have been more necessary to add more gravity to the plot. Nonetheless, the best thing to say that is that with the script, written by a team of three writers, keeps things rolling without spending too much time sketching out connections with the Marvel Cinematic Universe beyond SHIELD Agent Coulson, played by Clark Gregg, making a sweet appearance as a supporting figure. Chris Hemsworth proves to be the satisfying choice for the titular role, playing his character of humanity and clever sense of humor. His romantic chemistry with Natalie Portman is a bit weak, but perhaps less important to her characterization. English actor Tom Hiddleston on the other hand, submits arguably one of the most appealing villainous performances ever brought to the superhero realm, operating his role with both menace and darkly rooted charisma. Thor is a fun picture for both fans and a little bit of non-fans of Marvel Comics. Kenneth Branaugh crafts a warmly entertaining thrill ride that nicely meets the bar of summer superhero movies. For the filmmaker accomplishes, there is plenty to be offered in this solid rendition of its titular hero, though nothing destined to blow many other superhero entries out of the water. In conclusion, it fits the bill.",8,2,2,2 November 2017
The Happening," Not Bad!
","I'm not a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan, but he's made a few interesting movies such as the Sixth Sense. This film, the happening, is watched it the other night and I thought it was pretty good. It wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be, there were some stuff I found disappointing. First, the film had a decent first half but started slowing down its pace the second half where. Another thing is didn't like was the characters, there wasn't a whole lot of character development throughout the film or anything interesting about them. Mark Wahlberg did an okay job as his character, the rest I wasn't quite satisfied with. What this film needs is more inspiring characters and maybe a better plot line. Overall, I enjoyed the film. The whole premise of how everyone gets chased by a virus that causes them to become suicidal was quite interesting (and a bit weird some ways). To be honest, I'm not so sure why this film got so many negative reviews from audiences or even the critics. I think this is worth watching, especially if you're a fan of supernatural thrillers.",2,1,3,15 March 2014
Castle in the Sky," An enchanting exploration through heart and imagination, Hayou Miyazaki's Castle in The Sky is a spellbinding journey
","There are not many filmmakers like Hayou Miyazaki, especially here in the United States. The Japanese animation director and head of Studio Ghibli films has become a household in both the U.S and Japan for crafting motion pictures bound to push the boundaries of imagination since his directorial debut in the late 70s with 'The Castle of Cagliostro', a film that didn't see the light of day in the U.S until a little over a decade later. Castle in The Sky is a breathtaking adventure that dares to explore the indefinite world of heart and imagination, and what comes about Miyazaki's craftmanship is an journey that is by no means a tear-jerker, but an ultimately moving picture with an appeal for both kids, teens, and adults. Whether you are watching the original Japanese version or the English dub, the magic of Miyazaki's directorial hand shines like gold and transcends the picture into something more than your average family-friendly fairy tale. The film follows young teen Pazu (voiced by James Van Deek), an mechanical engineer who witnesses a young girl Sheeta (voiced by Anna Paquin) floating from the sky by the power of a glowing crystal she wears around your neck. When the two find themselves in a crash course between league of pirates lead by the dubious Dola (voiced by Cloris Leachman) and an army lead by a shady general (voiced by Jim Cummings) and the equally shady Muska (voiced by Mark Hamill), each of whom are after Sheeta to claim the crystal; the two youngster set out on a race to a secret temple floating thousands of feet in the sky. Together, they must learn the secret hidden within the mysterious castle. What Hayou Miyazaki proves is that he is not a filmmaker who takes ambition to granted. Every inch of storytelling he carries is poured into the picture with no amount of ambition squander in the slightest. And the magic of his efforts shine through nearly every frame. Blending elements of high-classed fantasy and science-fiction with a potent touch of human drama, this beautifully animated film hits the right notes from beginning to end, and the excitement upheld in every scene following the introduction of our young characters dares to leaves us gripped. When young protagonist Paza and his newly found friend Sheeta unexpectedly find themselves cross paths with a group of shady individuals and corrupt army officials, tension almost immediately takes hold and set the story in a sleek, solidly-paced motion. And as the story strolls along, an absorbing humanity within the two characters grows; and that combined with the voiced performances by James Van Deek and Anna Paquin are the leading aspects of the character's winning over the hearts of audiences. Although the story is nothing necessarily revolutionary, Miyazaki proves capable of crafting a plot with complex layers mixed with biblical symbolism which is more than likely to fly over children's heads; and that is only part of the whimsical magic lying within the director's grandeur.Castle in The Sky is a spellbinding journey of spectacular proportions, and definitely what earns the title of an outstanding achievement in Japanese animation. Whether you are a child, teenager, or an adult, there is something truly magical to be experienced in this adventure, something that many animated pictures are less than likely to uphold. For what Miyazaki accomplishes here, this is not far from the heights of a blistering masterpiece.",9,1,1,8 November 2017
The Departed," Martin Scorcese's The Departed is a modern gangster drama masterpiece
","No director has boasted a stricter understanding of the gangster genre than Martin Scorcese, at least not yet. His filmography dating back to 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' greatly prove this. We have seen a devilishly gritty portrayal of Henry Hill in the former movie, we have seen the portrayal of a crime family caught in the hazardous world of illegal gambling in the latter. If there is any director who's shown competition against Scorcese in breathing grit into the image of mobster families, it is Francis Ford Coppola with his uncompromising cinematic classic 'The Godfather'. This violent, gritty crime- thriller sees Scorcese continues his trademark cinematic ambition with showcasing an authentic take on the life of mobsters in the complicated world of crime. What many filmgoers may not to know is that this modern gangster piece happens to be a remake of a Chinese film 'Internal Affairs', following roughly the same plot and story structure. Set in the crime-ridden city of Southern Boston, Leonardo Dicaprio plays Billy Costigan, a brash undercover cop and former convict of the Boston Police Department, who is assigned by Captain Queenan (played by Martin Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Digman (played by Mark Wahlberg) to infiltrate an Irish mob gang run by Frank Costello (played by Jack Nicholson). With FBI informant Colin Sullivan (played by Matt Damon) set as Costello's mole and trusts of long-time friends and business partners put to the test, Costigan gets involved in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse as the two fight to uncover each other's identities. In the world of modern day mobsters, things gets complex in a brutally ugly way. And director Martin Scorcese more than just demonstrates here. Keeping the high stakes high and the story engaging, Scorcese places a nasty twist on the mobster genre with this crime-drama where almost none of the characters are who they say they are or make out to be. Then the question that lies throughout the entirety of the plot is who are the good guys and the who are the corrupt ones. The question which lies among the characters escalates into a tautly-paced race against two of the main characters Billy Costigan and Colin Sullivan racing to discover each other's identities. With gunfights erupting in the streets of Boston and the lives of close allies threatened by corrupt individuals handled by the antagonist and crime boss Frank Costello, the film proceeds with an appropriately dark atmosphere. Scorcese does a magnificent job on propelling each scene with near-constant tension and substance, and persistently maintains absorbing character development to keep things engaging without losing track of momentum. Leonardo Dicaprio's Billy and Matt Damon's Colin along with the roaring tyranny of Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello are driving forces of the plot as one of an undercover cop fighting for the truth, and the other is a backstabbing mobster who disguises an law enforcement to put the other in the pawn of their dubious plan. As the body count rises and the identities of the aforementioned characters are exposes, everything builds to a startling climax that seals the deal. Like many of Scorcese's pictures, there is plenty of bloodshed and hard-hitting violence to paint the ugly, but true portrait of the crime underworld. Leonardo Dicaprio, who last collaborated with Martin Scorcese as Amsterdam in 'Gangs of New York', suits up in the center figure of the film here and propels himself with plenty of fortitude and intensity in the role. Dicaprio has proved he is capable of playing roles of both the right and wrong side of the moral compass. His powerhouse portrayal proves is talented at channeling with both anger and striking humanity. Matt Damon, often known for playing the hero role or perhaps an ordinary human protagonist, is given a whole another ball game here. Shifting from his good guy persona to a corrupt individual with a perplexing agenda, Damon gives a genuinely versatile performance that marks easily one of the highest points of his career. Mark Wahlberg plays the trusted supporting figure of Dicaprio's protagonist and certainly makes a big name of himself here. His performance is strong and shines of emotional depth. But perhaps none of these actors are able to compete with Jack Nicholson who boasts a gritty portrayal of the ruthless mob boss Frank Costello. Although Nicholson is no stranger to playing character with violent tendencies, especially after playing the psychopath Jack Torrance in 'The Shining'; Nicholson propels with a sinister appeal to the role that makes this long-time actor stand out among the rest. His character, greatly inspired by real-life Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger, is about as darkly charismatic as many gang bosses in cinematic entries -- nothing more, nothing less.The Departed is a thrillingly enthralling modern-day gangster drama powered by Martin Scorcese's superb direction and powerhouse performances by a brutally talented cast. This Scorcese piece is an astounding cinematic effort that not only transcends the gangster genre, but marks a powerfully stunning masterpiece that is more than likely to stand the test of time in many years to come.",10,1,2,21 December 2015
Die Hard," Influential and revolutionary action movie that redefined its genre
","In the late 1980s, Director John McTiernan refined the action film genre with this action- packed thriller that not only stars Bruce Willis is the role that defined his career, but also brought impressed audiences everywhere with ecstatic action sequences complete with amazing practical effects, inspiring characters, and one of the most original scripts for an action movie written for its time. This movie stars Bruce Willis as John McClane, a New York cop who heads on vacation to Los Angeles for the holidays, to spend Christmas with his wife Holly Genero (played by Bonnie Bedelia) and kids. Upon arriving at the Nakatomi Plaza building where she works, he and his wife ended having an argument dealing with family matters. Their dispute is eventually interrupted when the building becomes under attack by a dozen German terrorists lead by the ruthless Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman) who's intent on robbing the company of its money. Pitted against overwhelming odds and Gruber's diabolical mind, John McClane must take matters into his own hands and fight off the terrorists who have his wife, along with hundreds of innocent civilians held hostage, with no aid from the Los Angeles Police Department who are helpless against the terrorists' overwhelming power.My family and I catch this fi on cable almost every year during the Christmas season and this never gets old. Unlike other action films from the 80s that spit cheesy little one-liners and mindless gun shootouts, this film presents viewers with a very likable protagonist who is self aware with his flaws and has feels very human, a Villain who is near equally likable and incredibly smart, and the dialogue between these two characters (which are spoken via walkie-talkies for the majority of the time) is very witty and clever that keep viewers' attention. The main character John McClane spends most of the time fighting off the terrorists who are lead by Hans Gruber, and the scenes are exciting to watch. Glossing with intense gunfights, explosions, stellar camera-work and fight choreography, the scenes keep viewers strapped to their seats. In the scenes when the action lightens up, there are some interesting conversations between characters like McClane, who at one point, shares a tender moment with a cop by admitting his flaws as a husband and a man as a whole. These moments are make you feel for the character and are presented in a realistic way and not sappy way. Bruce Willis does an excellent job as the main character and his performances him as the action hero he is today, along with his famous line 'Yippie Kay Yay, motherf***er'. The same can be said about Alan Rickman is gives off a performances as the one of the most charismatic antagonists ever put on screen. What really impresses me about this film is the action set pieces. The Nakatomi Plaza that serves as the film's main setting (at least during the beginning) is shot nowhere other than Twentieth Century Fox headquarters. Quite interesting!Die Hard is one of the most influential action films ever made and shines with nearly every aspect an action film needs. It is a good movie for viewers to pop a bag of popcorn, sit on the couch, and watch. Director John McTiernan did a fantastic job with this film as well as the cast. This film is a textbook example of what action films need to be and a movie that every action fan should not miss.",9,3,3,3 December 2015
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Revenge of The Fallen is loud, explosive metal-on-metal action extravaganza with plenty of visual heft, but very little ambition
","With the massive success of the 2007 Transformers entry, it is only expected that Michael Bay would continue the story. Upon facing a collision course with the 2007-2008 Writer's Strike however, Bay and a trio of writers were in a rush with the production process. The evidence of their production difficulties is greatly shown in this final product of this bombastic 150-minute metal-on-metal action extravaganza. While Bay keeps his promise of spectacular visual heft involving heavy battles of giants robots sparring against each other, the script is the bumbling disappointment. The movie is underplotted, scarce of interesting characters, and signals a decline in the spirit of what the original film is wildly entertaining hit. Of course, hoping for a firmly groundbreaking story in a Michael Bay would probably be a lot of ask for consider the director's past endeavors. This does not stray from the shallowness of his bruised continuation of the Transformers saga. Set after the events of the predecessor, Sam Witwicky (played by Shia Labeouf) has graduated high school and is now heading off to college in attempt to live a normal life away from the Autobots and Decepticons. Kissing his girlfriend Mikaela (played by Megan Fox) and his parents (played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White) good-bye, Sam embarks on his college career, only to be haunted by mysterious symbols printed on a piece of the Allspark. Soon on, Sam finds himself pulled back into the war between the Autobots lead by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) and the Decepticons who set out to wreck havoc on the human race. In the process, Mikaela and Sam's geeky roommate Leo (played by Ramon Rodriguez) are along for the ride. This film cooks with roughly the same ingredients of the first entry, although it appears a plot may be the very last item on agenda. The story intends on picking up not far from the where the previous film left off and continue the epic saga between the Autobots and the Decepticons. There was some fair potential at hand. Unfortunately, the majority of that potential is squandered on a thinly developed plot that not only fails to properly explain a few elements such as why the Decepticons are still after Sam, but occasionally dives into some absurd plot elements. If you need an example, one of which propels from Sam's sexual encounter with a college girl. After all, the film, even more so than the previous entry, takes heavy advantage from some awkward sexual innuendo including some racy dialogue uttered by the robots and a shot showing John Turturro in a G-string that place some moviegoers (particularly parents who bring their kids) at heave. Some of the humor is surprisingly funny, others are just flat-out crude and out of place. On the plus side, Bay boasts a somewhat commendable aptitude in special effects and visually alluring action set pieces showcasing the autobots and the decepticons going head-to-head and ripping each other apart in a loud explosion galore. The climatic battle set near the Pyramids of Egypt where military tanks are blown up, the pyramid is nearly decimated to pieces, and the explosion racks up a number nearly impossible to count; is sets stone in the film's biggest enchantment. If there is even a minor improvement from the predecessor, it may the performances by both Shia Lebeouf and Megan Fox which really isn't saying much, especially as the latter is once again recycled as a one-dimensional character delivering sex appeal for lingering shots of her body. The rest of the characters are sadly fall short of interest as well, particularly Ramon Rodriguez who's whiny personality and goofiness resembles more of an obnoxious caricature than a compelling character. Even when he lands maybe a few attempts at humor, his character can be quite a vexing device.Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen is a boisterous sci-fi action eye candy for those who are able to dive into the visually stunning action set pieces to distract themselves from the thinly written plot and characters. For everyone, this one may not be a your cup of tea. By no means is this big-budget sequel an abhorrent disaster. After all, there is plenty of visual heft that is destined to keep the youngster occupied. But it is a disappointing entry in this freshly born saga.",5,1,3,17 June 2017
The Witch," Unnerving supernatural thriller with something more clever in mind
","For the past several decades, horror fans have grown fond of horror classics such as slashers, psychological thrillers, and supernatural thrillers dealing with characters batting against paranormal entities. Only a hand of full films of the genre are successful at balancing both cohesive character and plot development while carrying on an effective scare factor, even fewer achieve this feat as effective as this thriller directed by first-time filmmaker Robert Eggers. Rather than driving audiences into to straight-forward scare fest, this film centering on witchcraft as the primary antagonist, focuses on the eerie atmosphere and construction of the plot leading up to its shocking twist in the finale. The film is set during the 1630s, decades prior to the Salem Witch Trials, a period of prosecutions and executions of men and women who were accused of witchcraft. It follows William (played by Ralph Ineson) and Catherine (played by Kate Dickle), a devout Christian couple living in a isolated countryside of New England who value leading their five children into their following with God. When their infant son Samuel mysteriously vanishes and the crops began to deteriorate, the family begins to suspect one of them is cursed with witchcraft. As their fears and suspicions mount, the family find their lives terrorized by the demonic force.This film is not the horror thriller many people come to expect, and instead has something more unique in mind rather than blowing up in your face with jump scares and sight scares that's become a common tool in many other films of this category. Relying heavily on visceral storytelling and character development, the film conveys it's scares by building up suspense through hints without feeling the need to fully reveal the occurrences but the aftermath of how the family is affected by witchcraft. When it's all done, the most of the scares come not from what the viewers know but what they don't know, along with an eerie, hair-raising music score by Mark Korven and a few shots of grim imagery. For most of the time, it's quite effective. Now the film moves at a fairly slow pace which is enough to bore those who lack patience, but in the end what results is creepy and intensely thought- provoking experience filled with engrossing performances by Ralph Enison, Kate Dickie, and Anya Taylor-Joy who plays the eldest daughter. Even the younger children make advantage of their time to shine. As Christianity and witchcraft play prominent roles in the story, the film moves in profound directions that demands you for questions. The biggest mistake this film makes is assuming you have expert knowledge on witchcraft. Though the film succeeds on provoking thoughts in viewers, it occasionally falls victim into convoluted elements raft are either confusing or overly ambiguous, maybe both. There are plenty of scenes you leave scratching heads. At the same time, there is plenty of shock and creepiness, particularly the ending. The Witch is both a creepy and deeply visceral experience uprooted by an intelligent direction by Robert Eggers. Though it has some flaws, this film works at a fairly solid level and by the next decade, has a fair potential of going down as a cult classic. It is a unique experience that values more thought-provoking themes than typical jump scares, and by the end, it's a thriller that demands for your attention, even if it doesn't attract those looking for a straight forward scare fest.",7,1,3,19 June 2016
Steve Jobs," A solid portrayal of Steve Jobs
","From the amazing director Danny Boyle and writer Aaron Sorkin who wrote 'The Social Network', comes a biopic based on Walter Isaacson's biographical novel of the late founder of Apple, one of the largest running business's in the world. This marks the second attempt to bring the story of the titular character, with the first being the 2013 film 'Jobs' starring Ashton Kutcher. Told in a three- act structure, this film stars Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs and follows the early years of his work that brought birth to a new age of digital technology, from the iconic launch of the 1984 Macintosh, to the launch of the 1986 NeXT computer (now defunct), to the release of the 1998 iMac computer. While this man was responsible to creating some of the biggest technological products in the world, his passion for this work lead to troubling relationships with his daughter Lisa who he denied paternity to, his best friend and co- founder Steve Wozniak (played by Seth Rogen), as well as his colleagues . Kate Winslet takes on the role as marketing executive Joanna Hoffman, and Jeff Daniels plays John Sculley who took over Apple as CEO after Jobs' outing. Danny Boyle and writer Aaron Sorkin give this film the most effective portrayal of Apple's late founder yet. Michael Fassbender gives such a vibrant performance as the titular character and soars so natural in his role, despite showing modest resemblance of Jobs in appearance, and his performance efficiently captured the callousness of Jobs' personality. What comes to more surprise is the portrayal of co- founder Steve Wozniak who shines with a striking performance by Seth Rogen who breaks his comedic typecasting. And let's not forget the charismatic presence of Kate Winslet who remains fresh as ever. Unlike the previous Steve Jobs biopic from 2013, this one takes a more artistic fashion of portraying the story backstage of Jobs' career with Apple and the now defunct company NeXT with pure energy. As the story focuses more on his personal relationships with his family and colleagues than the inside look at his work, which does detract the film of some the biographical touch, the story is told in a very dramatized manner. Every scene consisting of plenty of talking feels so fast paced, especially as these scenes are filmed in real-time. The conversation between the characters are quite gripping and never feel dull, though those expecting a more fact-based storytelling may be slightly disappointed. The most inspiring aspect of these however, is how the cinematography, with each act of the film shot in various formats to present a visual reflection of the time period in which each takes place. Steve Jobs is solid piece of entertainment by Danny Boyle and probably the most effective and powerful portrayal of the late Steve Jobs ever put to screen. This is a very entertaining film with mesmerizing performances from a talented cast; a great, though flawed direction, and a sharp screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. It is just a shame that this film suffered miserably at the box office, this film deserves more attention than what it has received so far.",7,0,1,5 February 2016
War of the Worlds," Steven Spielberg's rendition of H.G. Wells's classic novel scores for a thrilling, if flawed experience
","For the past few decades, Steven Spielberg has been an expert at crafting both inspiring and riveting stories into outstanding cinematic pieces. Sprawling across nearly every genre in the book, Spielberg has proved to be gifted with a hefty hand with mesmerizing storytelling, engrossing characters, and for science-fiction entries, flashy special effects. His tour de force style of filmmaking explodes on screen in this dark, atmospheric alien-invasion thriller inspired loosely off the pages of H.G. Wells's acclaimed novel. With many liberties taken from the source material including giving the lead character a name and being a divorced father of two, Spielberg takes heavy inspiration from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks to generate an intense, disaster-esque alien invasion thrill ride with a more heart-throbbing direction than many other alien flicks like Roland Emmerich's 'Independence Day'. And the main star of the chaotic thrill ride is Tom Cruise who's collaborating with Spielberg for the second time following their first adventure together in cyberpunk thriller 'Minority Report' which took from the pages of Phillip K. Dick's novel of the same name. This film follows a Brooklyn dock worker Ray Ferrier (played by Tom Cruise), a divorce father who's set look after his ten-year old daughter Rachel (played by Dakota Fanning) and sixteen-year old son Robbie (played by Justin Chatwin) for a week. Upon their visit, the city of Brooklyn suddenly attacked by an army of alien tripods that mysteriously arrived from the sky. Fleeing in Ray's van, the family sprawls on a cross-country trip in efforts to reunite the children's mother Mary Ann (played by Miranda Otto) while fighting vigorously to arrive against the extraterrestrial invasion.Steven Spielberg is no stranger to stories dealing with extraterrestrial invasion when looking at his work in 'Close Encounters of The Third Kind' and 'E.T'. Unlike those entries, Spielberg ventures on the more bleak side of alien encounters that fully defies the friendly portrayal of extraterrestrial lifeforms as shown in the latter. Focusing firmly on the ground-level survival of a family rather than a series of spaceships battles demonstrated on 'Independence Day', Spielberg rarely pulls any punches when portraying the horror of the chaos and pays fair inspiration from the 9/11 attacks, which is firmly demonstrated in a shot with Tom Cruise's character looking in the mirror tattered in dust and rubble from head to waist. From the opening minutes of the aliens' arrival, the story plunges into a grim, tension-heavy atmosphere where the lives of our main characters are in grave danger and innocent lives blasted into clouds of dust by alien laser beams. And it is all frightening to sit through. These sequences are blissfully crafted together with a hodgepodge of explosive special effects and clean-cut CGI. The story, which follows a largely divergent trajectory from H.G. Wells, advances at a solid pace but hits a major speed bump during a scene with Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning's creepy encounter with a mentally crazed man in a basement cellar, played by Tim Robbins. This scene marks easily one of the biggest weakpoints, with other being the anti-climatic ending which slams the door on the story in a ludicrously lazy manner, as if the writers suddenly ran out of ideas. Though the film effectively sets stone a firmly thrilling experience, it is left with a burnt fuse during its conclusion. In final words, Tom Cruise exercises a fine, though slightly inconsistent performance. Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin stand solid in the underage roles, nothing more, nothing less.War of The Worlds is a compelling rendition of H.G. Wells's classic source material that scores for a thrilling, if flawed experience. Although it does not stand tall as one of Steven Spielberg's most profound works and suffers a disappointing final turn, it stands solid as a thrilling science-fiction popcorn flick.",7,0,1,1 February 2017
12 Years a Slave," Strong and Harrowing look at the reality of slavery
","Slavery is a subject that Hollywood doesn't touch enough. It was one of the most grim periods in American history. Slavery, however, is realistically demonstrated in this historical drama, based on a novel and real-life tale. Chiwetel Eijofor plays Solomon Northup, a free African-American husband and father of two, who is devastatingly stripped of his innocence when he betrayed by white men and sold into slavery. There, Northup struggles trying to survive the harsh reality of slavery in the Louisiania plantation, run by William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). Set in the 1850-60s, this film pulls absolutely no punches when depicting an image of slavery. The film is quite difficult to watch at times, especially since it is based on a true story. It is harrowing to watch how African Americans were treated so brutally, and how they were helpless against how these plantation owners deal with them with such callous attitude. It was painful to watch these innocent people being tied to trees, being whipped repeatedly with tremendous force, and being strangled to death. It is also harsh to see how the main character is psychologically torture by these men to the point where he gets forced to hurt some of his own people. Nonetheless, I was fascinated by how beautifully this was filmed, and the performances the actors give. Chiwetel Eijofor gave a mesmerizing performance as Solomon Northup, and the way he shows his emotions in many scenes gives his character a powerful feel. Michael Fassbender also showed some good talent as the plantation owner, Edwin Epps. We are also offered a brief, but memorable cameo by Brad Pitt.Yes, this film is very brutal but that is what makes it powerful. This film is not only the best film dealing with slavery, or perhaps one of the films of the decade so far. If you happen to come across this film, you definitely need to watch it.",10,0,2,16 April 2015
Sausage Party," Animated Seth Rogen comedy is as funny and irreverent as you'd expect
","Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have reunited once again in this incredibly raunchy R- rated comedy following their success with 'This Is The End' and 'Neighbors', except what's different this time is this comedy is an CGI animated feature revolving around talking food products rather than human characters (though there are a few). For a movie starring and written by Seth Rogen, you would expect to see a straight forward raunchy comedy with no-holds-bar vulgarity and abundance of four letter words. This comedy however, manages to squeeze in a surprisingly thought-provoking allegory to religion along with the predictably irreverent humor, similar to what we saw in 'This Is The End' which followed a cast of characters trying to survive the apocalypse. Featuring the voices of Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, David Krumholtz, Salma Hayek, James Franco, Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, and several others to name; this movie follows a wide of cast of food products at a local supermarket who live their lives awaiting to be taken away by the 'gods' (shopping customers) into a world known as the 'great beyond', a place of comfort and endless happiness. When they discover the ugly truth of what really goes on in the so-called paradise, Frank the Sausage (voiced by Seth Rogen) must rally up his friends to help save from the unspeakable terror that awaits them.A comedy about foul-mouth talking food? Yeah, kinda sounds like a dumb idea, right? Well, with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg behind the writing process, this movie unexpectedly manages to be much smarter than what you may anticipate while at the same time, being hysterically funny in blatantly absurd ways. Advertised with inventive marketing, this highly anticipated comedy delivers much more than just a string of raunchy R-rated humor and a no-brainer of a plot. Rogen and Goldberg accomplish this by formulating the plot that serves as a metaphor to Christianity, with the food being purchased by shoppers and taken into the 'great beyond' which serves as a clear analogy to heaven. One line in particular is 'the gods work in mysterious ways'. This also includes some comedic dialogue and humor that falls metaphorical to references of the bible including a silly musical number in which the film opens up with. Yes, the humor has no reservation of being politically incorrect or downright offensive, especially with all the seemingly non-stop profanity. At the same time, Rogen and Goldberg know how to make it funny and subversive. Sure, some of the jokes do fall on the mean-spirited side, or under the not-so-rare circumstances push the envelope, particularly the massive food orgy scene. Though it is meant to be funny, it's necessarily clever or even charming in the slightest. On the other hand, the film as a whole knows how to be funny in a way that works, even without the constant vulgar gags thrown around here and there. Sausage Party is a funny and irreverent animated comedy that shows Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg still have their A-game, even if their over-the-top humor isn't everyone's cup of tea. This movie is astoundingly hilarious and is worth seeing. However, although this is an animated feature, parents are strongly discouraged of bringing their children to this one. So if you are a parent, please hire a babysitter and leave the kids at home. This is not a film you'll want to expose to their young eyes.",9,118,223,15 August 2016
There Will Be Blood," Daniel Day Lewis shines in this astounding masterpiece
","Director Paul Thomas Anderson, the innovative mind behind the critically acclaimed 'Boogie Nights', 'Magnolia', and 'The Master', shows off his blissful talent to the silver screen in this somber cinematic adaption of Upton Sinclair's 1920s novel Oil!. There Will Be Blood is an ingenious effort that simply can't be ignored, regardless if you have grown in the Paul Thomas Anderson fanfare or not, or adored the arresting talent of three-time Academy Award winner Daniel Day Lewis. Anderson comprises together a powerful narrative inspired by Upton Sinclair's Classic literary work and irresistible performances to put together what can easily be called a true cinematic gem. Set in the early 1900s, Daniel Day Lewis plays Daniel Plainview, an ambitious oil driller working for an oil rig in rural New Mexico community. Plainview is indeed a hard worker but also crucially demanding when it comes to reaching his goals in the oil company and providing for him and his adopted son H.W. (played by Dillon Freasier). Sprawling across the deserted community, Plainview meets Paul Sunday (played by Paul Dano), son of a farming family who informs him of an oil supply in California. Plainview makes a deal with Paul's twin brother Eli (also played by Paul Dano), an evangelist church pastor to sell their property to provide for their church. As they begin to pump off the oil from the property, Daniel becomes consumed with greed and hatred that contributes to a bizarre relationship between him and Eli. Daniel Day Lewis has boasted an astonishing acting talent over the past two decades, and much can be proved by this triumphant appearances such as in Jim Sheridan's 'My Left foot, Martin Scorses's 'Gangs of New York', and Steven Spielberg biopic drama 'Lincoln'. Though his filmography runs somewhat infrequent filmography, he's elevated the ladder to become what many consider one of the finest Hollywood actors of this generation. This method actor portrays the main character of Daniel Plainview, a devoted father with deep care of his oil business as well as his young son but leaves himself swallowed in greediness and cold-hearted personality. Lewis fuels this role with what is possibly his most astounding performance he's given in his career. He delivers such a captivating portrayal in this role it allows viewers feel the heat of the character's emotionality. The Oscar acquired by his performance definitely comes to no surprise. Paul Dano takes on the often challenging task of playing dual roles, portraying twin brothers Paul and Eli, the latter which is a church pastor. Like Lewis, Dano knocks the ball out of park with his performances. He makes a pretty interesting character in the story, a God-loving farmer who is caught in an enigmatic relationship with Daniel Plainview. He gets his best time to shine during the scenes in which he preaches sermons and baptisms, his portrayal stand strong, if a little off-putting by the emotional tension played in these scenes.Paul Thomas Anderson is shown to have a gift in not only directing but powerful storytelling. While the film is based on Upton Sinclair's novel, this film takes some notable liberties from the book to show that Anderson has something more interesting in mind. Boasting a story of the main character's desperation to rise to the top, the film explores themes of hate, greed, religion, family relationships, and capitalism; and the writing by Anderson makes just enough for the story to explore each of them almost evenly. Religion plays a significant factor in the story as Paul Dano's character Eli Sunday is a church pastor who pleads for nothing more than his godly relationship. In one scene, he tries to help Daniel redeem himself from his greed and hateful behavior by inviting him to be baptized and recover from his past mistakes including his treatment of his son. Another intriguing (though less significant) is his son H.W's friendship with Eli's little sister Mary who is mentioned to be beaten by her father if she doesn't pray. The biggest and most gripping factor however, comes from the complex relationship between Daniel and Eli which faces a radical twists and surprises throughout the course of the film. The film moves a rather slow pace but at the same time, presents a gripping atmosphere and Anderson's screenplay. And let's not forget the engaging music score by Jonny Greenwood.There Will Be Blood is certainly what I call a true cinematic masterpiece. Blessed by the astounding direction and writing by Paul Thomas Anderson, and the arresting performances by Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano, this film is an endearing piece of work that is bound to go down as a classic possibly within the next decade.",10,0,2,18 May 2016
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Jack Nicholson flies over the cuckoo's nest
","It is difficult to say which cinematic role defined the meaning of Jack Nicholson's career, whether it's his portrayal as the sadistic psychopath in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining', the iconic DC villain 'Batman', or his role here as a criminally insane convict with the thirst for rebellion. Regardless, Nicholson has made a man of honest talent, and his talent still lights up to this day. This five Oscar-winning (including Best Picture) adaption to Ken Kessey's acclaimed novel shows this fine actor in what is arguably one of his most roles of his career. Directed by Milos Forman, Jack Nicholson plays McMurphy, a long-time criminal who is caught for criminal activity and sentenced to prison by the court once more. Upon the start of his prison sentence, McMurphy pleads mentally insane in hopes of escaping prison labor and is sent off to an institution for the mentally unstable. Upon arrival, McMurphy witnesses the dispiriting treatment of him and his fellow inmates by the hands of Nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher). Disgusted by her superiority and mental abuse, McCurthy takes matters into his own hands and rallies up the inmates to an effort to start a rebellion against the nurse. Unlike the critically acclaimed dramas such as 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'Green Mile', this movie supplements a more light-hearted and less somber take on the prison genre. Milos Forman grants a fair charm and ingenuity into what almost feels like a Stanley Kubrick-style picture. This director plants an engaging narrative material and a decent sense of dark humor from the ever charismatic Jack Nicholson. His character is the pinnacle of charm and entertainment as he builds solid chemistry with the supporting characters and a heated rivalry with the antagonistic Nurse Ratched who is blessed by a sinister portrayal by Louise Fletcher without giving an over- the-top or downright evil vibe, but of someone who simply doesn't understand the harm she causes. This actor delivers a darkly comical performance to portray the stark and colorful protagonist. Aside from his performance is a large roster of actors including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Brad Douriff and many others who turn in some fine performances but perhaps less memorable. There are moments of laughter, moments of dread, and a few scenes of shock, particularly the ending. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is a triumphant achievement by Milos Forman that demonstrates a fantastic performance by Jack Nicholson and a solid script. This movie is a must watch for film buffs everywhere as it serves as a good exploration into the early years of Jack Nicholson's career.",9,1,3,19 May 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," Inventive science-fiction action delivers the thrills
","Edge of Tomorrow stars Tom Cruise as William Cage, a military officer sent with the U.S Special Forces to stop a terrifying alien invasion that threatens the human race. Within the matter of minutes, Cage is killed in battle only to unexpectedly wake up at the beginning of the day where you he started before the battle. When he discovers this amazing power to reset the day, he ends up getting himself killed repeatedly and restarting the day multiple times to learn how the stop the invasion and get everything right. Emily Blunt plays Rita, one of Cage's comrades who assists him in the mission against the alien onslaught. Directed by Doug Limon who produced the Bourne series, with the exception the fourth installment with Jeremy Renner, Edge of Tomorrow is a rare science-fiction actioner that manages to come up with something original, which not many sci-fi flicks nowadays do. Based on the tag line 'Live, Die, Repeat', this film plays as a cross between Independence Day (1996) and Groundhog Day (1993) with the main character fighting against an army of aliens, while carrying the ability to restart the day over and over. Tom Cruise's character does die quite a bit in this movie. Halfway through the film, we experience a montage of his character and Emily Blunt's character training for the invasion, whenever Cruise makes a mistake Blunt would pull her gun and shoot him so he could wake up start over. This happens countless times and although it does get a bit repetitive after a while as you watch some of the same scenes countless times, the idea is nonetheless interesting. The special effects are fantastic and I can definitely say the same for the visual effects. The CGI on the aliens are incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully shot.Edge of Tomorrow can easily be called one of the best sci-fi films of this decade so far. I was very pleased with this movie, not just because of its special effects and visuals, but also because it expresses an original and inventive idea.",8,1,3,7 September 2015
Pitch Perfect 2," The Pitches return in this fun, energetic sequel
","Anna Kendrick and the crew are back in this exciting sequel many have been waiting for. Set three years after the first film, the Barden Bellas have become one of the most popular singing groups in their country. However, after an embarrassing incident during a show puts them in a negative spotlight, the girls attempt to regain their fame by competing in an international competition. I was very pleased by this film, it was funny, charming, energetic, and never disappointed me.I wouldn't say that this film was as good as the first one, but it pretty close. Like the first film, Pitch Perfect 2 brings out the laughter, charm, and heart that everyone enjoyed in the original. Rebel Wilson, who plays Fat Amy, is much funnier in this time around. Almost every one-liner she spits out had me laughing hysterically. The rest of the girls are very funny as well. I was quite intrigued by how Hailee Steinfield was cast as the new girl. I never expected to see her in a comedy. I was also surprised by some of the song they sing here. There were a lot of songs from the late 90s and early 2000s that many kids who grew in the 90s remember from their childhood as well as recent songs. Overall, this film was very satisfying. If you enjoyed the 2012 original, I will surely enjoyed this film. While its not quite on the level of the first film, it is still worth watching.",8,11,18,5 June 2015
Whiplash," It is an intense, powerful, and electrifying work of art
","Damien Chazelle's Whiplash represents arguably one of the most exhilarating cinematic endeavors in the music genre in recent memory, let alone one by a man making his directorial debut. It is a music-themed that takes on the daunting task of delivering a feverishly thrilling atmosphere not from the emotional resonance of its music, but its bold psychological tone that proceeds its heart- rending story. By Chazelle's thoughtful direction and the uncompromising performances by actors Miles Teller and J.K Simmons, this film doesn't just achieves this task, it embraces. The story here is not one of your battle-of-the-bands tales involving a band or a solo musician shooting for the stars, it is a story concerning the complex and thought-provoking relationship between a young musician and his mentor. And it is one that hits hard in ways that a very few would expect. This film follows Andrew Neiman (played by Miles Teller), an inspired drummer who enrolls in a local music conservatory where he joins a jazz band conducted by the talented, but maniacal Terence Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons). Fletcher is most certainly not a kind-hearted mentor, he is abusive towards his band and holds no bars when splashing his band with an severely ill temper each time one of them makes a mistake. Upon joining the band, Andrew suffers under Fletcher's mental abuse to pushing him to the limits, but at the same time, inspires the immersive talent he never knew he had. If you think you are in for another cheery and whimsical musical tale, think again. This film takes the music genre and grips with a dark twist, and Damien Chazelle accomplishes this in a way that puts the film on the border of a thriller than a drama. The narrative crux of the story is the complex relationship between an ambitious drummer who wants to exercise his talent to the fullest when he arrives to the opportunity, and a cold, anger-fueled conductor who threatens to tear him apart with his mental abuse, yet sees an inspiring talent in the young man. This all comes down to an exhilarating tale of a young man discovering his hidden talent, while enduring a harrowing maltreatment from his mentor that will leave viewers questioning his actions from start to finish. At one point, Andrew drums with such endurance to where his hands starts bleeding, while Fletcher is busy losing his temper and hurling chairs and instruments at his students. Throughout the picture, the story vigorously questions the actions of this conductor, but never answers. That alone makes for an astounding and thought-provoking aspect of the story. The biggest spark in the picture, however is the performance by J.K. Simmons as Fletcher. Channeling R. Lee Ermey's Drill Sergeant from 'Full Metal Jacket', Simmons doesn't just play the role, he swallows it with immense precision that allows his inspiring, yet grueling character burst out of the screen with great versatility. It is the kind of performance that simply grabs you by the heart and never lets go. Miles Teller on the other hand, shines like gold through his incredible drumming skills. It is a performance that not only allows him to expand his acting chops, but to exercise his musical talent as well. Whiplash is an intense, powerful, and electrifying cinematic endeavor with performances that are simply too difficult to ignore and an inspiring direction by Damien Chazelle that makes for an absorbing directorial debut. It is an astounding cinematic achievement that makes for a powerful contender on my list for the top ten films of 2014.",9,7,13,26 March 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Top-notch Martin Scorsese film with a fantastic performance by Leonardo Dicaprio
","Many know Martin Scorsese for his critically acclaimed crime-dramas such as Taxi Driver (1976), Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995), and Gangs of New York (2002). Some might have never guessed he would take a leap into the comedy genre since his 1983 black comedy, King of Comedy. Martin Scorsese and Leonardo Dicaprio make their fifth collaboration in The Wolf of Wall Street, an intelligent biopic comedy about crime, corruption, and cheating against the law enforcement, that should have landed multiple Oscars.Based on true events set in the late 80s and early 90s, Leonardo Dicaprio plays Jordan Belfort, a New York stockbroker who takes a job at Wall Street, only to get laid off when the company suffers a severe downfall. In an effort to regain wealth, Belfort raises his own financial company, Stratton Oakmont, with the help Donnie Azoff (played by Jonah Hill). He begins living a life of extreme wealth, sex, and drugs by defrauding financial investors that eventually draws unwanted attention by the FBI. Leonardo Dicaprio gives one of the most mesmerizing performances of his career. He has long-lasting impressions with his performances on many of Martin Scorsese films such as Gangs of New York, The Aviator, Shutter Island, and The Departed. In this film, he does a job at being funny, charismatic, and faithful on his portrayal of Jordan Belfort. Many scenes left me laughing hysterically, but at the same time, shocked by some of Belfort's actions. There are several scenes include Belfort gets high on hardcore drugs like quaaludes and cocaine. I was pretty shocked by these scenes but most of the time, they're funny. Jonah Hill also gives a hilarious and decent performance as Jordan's Belfort'a assistant. Martin Scorsese did an amazing job on mixing his unique style of filmmaking with a comedic tone. Yes, the film runs for three hours but it manages entertaining throughout its time. Many viewers however, have expressed negativity for the excessive sex and nudity that goes on the film. The film does push the envelope with frequent sexual content and nudity from both genders. However, it never gets extreme to the point where it makes the film look pornographic. This film also now holds the record of the most F-bombs used in a film. Nonetheless, the film is very enjoyable, funny, and a must-see for everyone. But when I mean everyone, I don't include anyone under the age of 17. Overall, I was pretty disappointed that this film didn't land any Oscars, especially Leonardo Dicaprio (although he was nominated). This film deserves more than what it received. It is wild and astonishingly entertaining comedy done by the surprising comedic efforts of Martin Scorsese, and stands as one of his best films since The Departed.",9,0,5,25 May 2015
Scream 2," Clever follow-up to Wes Craven's horror franchise
","Wes Craven gained respect of horror fans with his 1996 hit slasher hit Scream, a film that reignited the slasher-horror genre with its originality and self-awareness. The following year, Craven continued the story of the masked killer with this entertaining sequel that continues the story. Neve Campbell reprises her role as Sidney Prescott who is now in college, and is dating a handsome heartthrob named Derek (played by Jerry O'Connell). Jamie Kennedy also reprises his role as Randy Meeks, the film-geek who's remained friends with Sidney after the events from the first movie. This film follows a copycat killer that is on the loose and taking the lives of others on college campus. Sidney must team up with her boyfriend Derek, and Randy, along with Gale and Dewey who also make their return from the first film, to survive against the killer's onslaught.As this film is a sequel, there are quite a bit discussions between characters about sequels and what they are all about. Like this film, these characters are very self-aware of the strategies of surviving against a killer in a horror movie, and the script makes very clear. While this one may not level up the previous film, it still remains as original and thoughtful as the previous film came out to be. It still contains the scares, suspense, and bloodshed by the Ghostface killer, and the wittiness of writer Kevin Williamson's script. It also pays a good homage to classic low-budget slasher horror films from the 80s like Splatter University, Slaughter High, and and Graduation Day. Liev Schreiber makes an interesting appearance as Cotton Weary who was the accused suspect of Sidney's mom's murder in the last, and is released from prison after proved not guilty. Neve Campbell remains good as ever as Sidney, and the rest of the cast including Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Jerry O'Connell, Timothy Olyphant, and Elise Neal are great as well. Could this movie have done better? Sure. But overall, this movie did not dissappoint me. This movie is one of the few horror movie sequels that manages to level relatively close with its original, and shows while Wes Craven is such an amazing horror director.",7,3,3,14 September 2015
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Entertaining third installment of the beloved action franchise
","John McTiernan has returned for a third time, and so Bruce Willis making his appearance as the beloved action hero John McClane. This time around, John McClane has become a heavy alcoholic, to the point where he is not only separated from his wife Holly but has also been suspended from the New York Police Department. After making an a rather awkward encounter with a Harlem pawn shop owner Zeus Carver (played by Samuel L. Jackson), the two witness a bomb go off in a department store nearby. The criminal mastermind behind the explosion is no one other than German terrorist Simon Gruber (played by Jeremy Irons) who gives McClane a call and pulls him a deadly game of 'Simon Says', where he must perform a series of tasks around the city. Each time he fails to comply, another bomb will detonate. Assisted by the reluctant Zeus Carver, McClane must finish Simon's devious tasks one by one to save the city and stop him and his crew from robbing the Federal Reserve Building. I have watched Die Hard and Die Hard 2 plenty of times, and are they're both pretty fun action movies. The first one left a cinematic landmark on the action genre, and was a career-defining film for Bruce Willis. The second one is quite entertaining, though didn't quite make an everlasting impression like the predecessor. This one continues the franchise with more fun and edge-of-your-seat action, with Samuel L. Jackson making a surprising appearance as the supporting hero who helps John McClane on his mission to thwart Simon Gruber's twisted plan. Jackson is certainly not an actor I expected to see star opposite Bruce Willis in the franchise. Nonetheless, he does a fine job as his character, even when he gets annoying with his racial one-liners. Bruce Willis remains good as ever as the main character, showing a charismatic performance that brought to the previous two films. Willis and Jackson both work shockingly well together, and based on their performances; you can tell that these two star studs are having a blast. Jeremy Irons also brings solid appeal to his role as the main villain, though he doesn't quite bring the same charisma as what Alan Rickman delivered in the first film. I have to admit though, he does come pretty close.What is a Die Hard movie without some spectacular action sequences and a solid plot? A bad one, that's for sure. This film is filled with some exciting action scenes, complete with some tense gunfights off and on, an intense subway crash, and of course, some explosions done by the antagonist Simon Gruber. The plot on the other hand, is the biggest gem of the film. Based on the decent screenplay, the film follows a plot of the villain's plan to commit robbery, much like the previous films which also deal with robbery to acquire large sums of money, but never gets old nonetheless. The plot is full of surprises and suspense, and is solidly paced to grab viewer's attention and never let go. There is never a dull moment throughout the 131-minute runtime. Die Hard With a Vengeance is a decent continuation to John McTiernan's action franchise, and proves that Bruce Willis is still committed to his character John McClane. It is rare for a film series to age well after its third installment, but this manages to show that the third film is not always the end of the line for a great franchise.",7,1,1,5 January 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," Another pleasant surprise from the Coen Brothers
","Joel and Ethan Coen, the geniuses behind 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski', O Brother Where Are Thou' and 'No Country for Old Men, are back once again, and have delivered splendid surprise with this period set comedy-drama starring an exhilarating cast of some of the biggest actors to shine in Hollywood today. This film set in the 1950s, places Josh Brolin in the role of Eddie Mannix, a Hollywood studio executive of a company known as 'Capitol Pictures', a studio company filming their new motion picture titled 'Hail Caeser' which stars a hotshot actor Baird Whitlock (played by George Clooney) as a messiah warrior in a biblical story set in Ancient Rome. However, when Whitlock is drugged and mysteriously abducted, Eddie must get his head in the game and keep the actors and staff workers of the industry in line, including a attractive swimmer DeeAnna Moran who becomes pregnant during production (played by Scarlett Johansson), a singing cowboy Hobie Doyle (played by Alden Ehrenreich) who must deal with an ill-tempered film director (played by Ralph Fiennes), and a sailor-suited dancer Burt Gurney (played by Channing Tatum). Jonah Hill makes an appearance as the financial agent.This film is filled with almost everything you can expect from a movie directed by the Coen Brothers: engaging characters, stellar performances, and a solid screenplay. This film is both funny and energetic at various points, with its story set in the Hollywood industry during the post-World War II era. Joel and Ethan Coen make great use with the story with the idea poking fun at Hollywood with clever social commentary and diving into the hypocrisy and corruption that goes on behind the camera. While the story does have some flaws in terms of consistency with its overflowing subplots thrown at every turn, it moves considerably well. Throughout the run time, we are treated with some of most masterful scenes including an stylish musical number by Channing Tatum who demonstrates an impressive dance routine, Scarlett Johansson performing a musical opera with her exotic swim skills, and a powerful cinematic-fueled monologue by George Clooney's character. Then the story dips into the scandalous behavior including communism which was a major threat to Hollywood back in the 50s, committed by the stars and crew members and the dishonesty that drives the production into trouble. These scenes paint such a dazzling picture at the Hollywood environment in the 1950s. And with the colorful production design that gives the scenes a moody and eye-popping 50s-style look really stands as a work of art.With such a stellar cast, incredible performances are what many can only ask for. Josh Brolin gives stunning performance as the main character who must deal with the atrocities that go on when their production goes to utter hell. George Clooney shines bright in his role as the actor starring in a historical motion picture that pays a good homage to 1959 classic 'Ben-Hur', and the monologues his character delivers in the filming scenes are quite entertaining to watch. Channing Tatum is also quite impressive in his role, playing a Gene Kelly-like character and performing a catchy tap dance on the counter and tables at a bar, while delivering a shocking singing voice. Scarlett Johansson and Ralph Fiennes are both good, but is sadly underused for the most of the time. Serving even less screen time is Jonah Hill as the financial agent of the company. The fact that the his character has very little screen time is quite a shame as he gives a credible acting for his time on-screen. Alden Ehrenreich is probably one of the best actors here, playing a cowboy with an archetype of Kirby Giant. Hail, Ceaser! is a great work of art by the Coen Brothers and an inspiring take on the satire of Hollywood. This is film sparkled with tremendous performances, a great screenplay, dazzling characters, and let's not forget the profound cinematography by Roger Deakins. Maybe not the best of their works, but it still deserves our attention. Hail, Ceaser is a movie every Coen Brothers should see.",7,2,5,14 February 2016
The Green Mile," Breathtaking and heart-touching spectacle based on Stephen King's works
","In this mesmerizing drama based on the hit novel by Stephen King, Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb, a prison guard at a a Louisiana death row penitentiary known as the Green Mile. His fellow prison guards include Brutus Howell (played by David Morse), Harry Telwinger (played by Jeffrey McDunn), and Dean Stanton (played by Barry Potter). Then there is Percy Whitmore (played by Doug Hutchinson), a cruel and sadistic guard who Paul only hires because he is the son of the state governor. His ruthless and appalling demeanor towards the prisoners gains him hatred by the fellow guards. On a long and ordinary, the guards are introduced to prisoner John Coffey (played by Michael Clarke Duncan), an unusually tall, buff man who is sentenced when he is falsely accused of the rape and murder of two little girls. Coffey soon reveals to have an incredible gift to heal people. This film is set in the 1930s during the Great Depression era.When we are first introduced to John Coffey, he's not a man of many words. He says very little for quite some time, and is insulted by his fellow prison mates. As the story goes on, he learn some intriguing things about this character such as his ability to heal and take away illnesses. Michael Clarke Duncan delivers a highly enthralling performance as this character. His dialogue just touches your heart and leaves you breathless. His performance was nominated for Best Actor in Supporting Role that was sadly taken by Michael Caine in Cider House Rules. Tom Hanks is also impressive as Paul Edgecomb who forms a bond with Coffey and decides he wants to help him. Doug Hutchinson portrays Percy Whitmore, a character the viewers will want to punch in this face. Hutchinson gives off an ingenious portrayal of this character who enjoys watching others' pain and treats the prisoner with absolute cruelty. This is best demonstrated in the scene that introduces him when he agitates one of the prisoners and eventually breaks his hand, and in another scene, when he crushes a pet mouse under his foot, then another scene where he purposely sabotages a prisoner's execution that ends horrifically. Man! What a jerk! This story is very powerful and moving, and will undoubtfully have you reaching for tissues. Frank Darabont does a fantastic job at constructing story and characters as well as demonstrating some great cinematography.The Green Mile is a must-see film for everyone. While it may feel long and slow with its three-hour runtime, it is very captivating and a film that you will never forget, complete with performances that are nothing short of magnificent.",9,1,2,18 September 2015
Jaws," Steven Spielberg's creature feature masterpiece still holds up today
","Following his directorial debut with the 1974 flick 'Sugarland Express', Steven Spielberg, a pioneer of the new age of Hollywood took the world by storm when he introduced this edge-of-your-seat thrill ride that made many around the world fear of going back into the water. Wielding with likable performances by a cast of Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss, and the larger-than-life Robert Shaw, as groundbreaking suspense too powerful to ignore; this summer flick not only stole the position of the first summer blockbuster in the cinematic world, but defined the very career of Steven Spielberg. Shot in 1974, the production of the film dragged Spielberg through a journey of tribulations involving his newly inventive special effects that no filmmaker in Hollywood used before. Most notably was the 24-foot mechanic shark that failed to work throughout which resulted in minimal showings of the shark on screen. Ironically, it made for better suspense and better thrills (and plenty of gore) to leave audiences at the edge-of-their-seats. The film follows Roy Schneider as Sheriff Martin Brody who moves his family to the beautiful Amity Island, home of a highly tourized beach that soon becomes a place of nightmares when a hungry Great White Shark makes his way near shore and eats one of the tourists alive. With Mayor Larry Vaughn (played by Murray Hamilton) refusing to close down the beach to ensure the economic standing, Brody sets out along with marine biologist Matt Hooper (played by Richard Dreyfuss) and charismatic fisherman Quint (played by Robert Shaw) on cross-sea adventure to exterminate the hungry creature.This creature feature isn't quite what I consider Steven Spielberg's magnum opus, but there is no arguing that this film is a cinematic ark. In the decade following the age of Alfred Hitchcock a.k.a. Master of Suspense, Spielberg surprised audiences with some of the most effective thrills that left many viewers squirming in their seats and concerning about hypothetical occurrences falling victim to shark attack. Though whether these thrills happen to blow Alfred Hitchcock out of the water is debatable, they really struck at the heart and still manage to stay frightening even up to this day. Spielberg accomplishes this feat by not (unintentionally) showing the shark for the majority of the movie, but instead using cutthroat cinematography to show the shark's perspective under the water and reducing the shark's on screen presence to brief pop-up appearances before the final twenty minutes. Much of the heart-stopping suspense is accomplished not just by the nifty camera work, but John Williams' iconic score that remains highly influential to this day; playing in many other movies and spoofs on television shows. Though the atmosphere stays mostly eerie, the film provides a few moments of levity and a pinch of humor every now and then, most notably a scene with the three main leads engaging in a light-hearted conversation on the boat while taking a break from their shark hunt. Along with the sheer suspenseful tone is some charismatic performances by Roy Schneider and Richard Dreyfuss. But the major draw in the acting department is Robert Shaw who delivers a lively portrayal of an old fisherman who uses his World War II experience as his expertise for the characters' death-defying mission. The actors fuels plenty of charisma and humanity in his role with cutthroat dialogue. By the end, he easily takes the stand as the most likable character of them all. Jaws is triumphant cinematic masterpiece uprooted by the hands of Steven Spielberg, and with great suspense and influential cinematic tropes that still remain highly spoken of today. This is easily one of Spielberg's best works, and one that could be nearly impossible for any shark feature to measure up to. Though many films have tried desperately in the past, none have prevailed.",10,2,4,8 September 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Newly update rendition of King Kong is no game-changer. Nonetheless, it is a satisfying experience
","As an average monster B-movie, Kong: Skull Island does about everything it sets out to do. It is fast-paced, it is thrilling, and it is pure eye candy in terms of special effects. But when it comes to leveling up with previous iterations like the Peter Jackson installment back in 2005, it is perhaps less than successful as was Gareth Edward's 'Godzilla' in reaching the heights of the original Godzilla. Jordan Vogt-Roberts takes the director's chair to deliver an extravagant re-imagination of the giant gorilla. Blending in eye-popping special effects, visual spectacle, and sleek anti-war commentary, Roberts places the story of the giant gorilla in 70s Vietnam War period with visual heft that pays clear nods to Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' while attempting to retain the spirit of the popular Hollywood ape. Set in 1973, this film follows Bill Randa (played by John Goodman), a senior government official who leads a group of soldiers including British Air Service Captain James Conrad (played by Tom Hiddleston), U.S Army Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (played by Samuel L. Jackson), and U.S Army Major Jack Chapman (played by Toby Kebbell) along with a team of young soldiers and photojournalist Mason Weaver (played by Brie Larson) to an uncharted Pacific island where they encounter vicious creatures. Of course, the biggest threat of the island happens to be giant gorilla the size of a skyscraper who unleashes hell upon their arrival. With the help of World War II veteran Hank Marlow (played by John C. Reilly) who's been stranded on the island for nearly three decades, it is up to the big group to escape the island while surviving against the violent Gorilla and monstrous creature onslaught.There is definitely nothing special or subversive about Jordan Vogt-Roberts, and the quality of his direction is predictably undermined by the previous iterations of titular gorilla. Roberts's execution for the popular source material is bit more blockbuster-ized than what Hollywood has spawned in the past. When it comes to delivering the thrills however, gets the job done. The plot quickly kicks into gear during the first half-hour when the ensemble cast of characters arrive on the island in helicopters, and the thirty-story gorilla appears out of nowhere swatting the helicopters from the air, blowing them in smithereens. The tension only heats up when the cast is forced to face down a wide variety of freaky creatures including carnivorous pterodactyls and boney dinosaur-like creatures that eat humans for breakfast. And this is all complete with slick CGI and a wide plethora of explosions to feast the eyes. There is definitely a Jurassic Park vibe to handed here. Characters are attacked, some of them are eaten, and the there is a grueling creature-on-creature battle that erupts during the final stretch. Underneath it all is a hodgepodge of anti-war commentary and morality issues toward the end that play roles in the story, and Roberts does not hesitate to spew a few homages of old Vietnam War flicks from the 80s era. It is easy to interpret to story as a B-monster movie decorated as a war flick. In terms of characterizations, the majority of the characters who sadly depth, with only Samuel L. Jackson's Preston Packard and John C. Reilly's Hank Marlow only being well developed. And it is the latter that serves as the show-stealer of the pack. Sprouting with charisma and kind-hearted humor, Reilly gives arguably the biggest appeal. The rest of the cast give some alright performances, but it does little to redeem for the shallow development. Kong: Skull Island is an exhilarating monster flick blooming with thrills, shiny special effects, and a direction that fairly pays off. This rendition of the popular primate is far from a game-changer nor does it try to be one. To say the least, it is a fun pre-Summer flick. If you are craving to see a giant gorilla the size of a skyscraper wrecking havoc and smashing creatures to oblivion, this one will make that investment.",7,1,3,16 March 2017
Bring It On," Bring It On is a funny, if formuliac teen comedy for teens and adults alike
","With many sports-based flick centering on football, basketball, baseball, and other sorts, cheerleading is a sport that's very underpopulated in the sports genre, with many debating on whether or not it is an actual sport. This teen comedy directed by Peyton Reed places the under-appreciated sport at the pinnacle of its funny, though formulaic story. Generating light-heart laughs and teen-friendly charm without diving into the territory of R-rated vulgarity, this sports-based comedy stands just as your average teen laugh-out-loud with nothing particularly special beyond its unoriginal execution. Nonetheless, it is a feel-good story of determination and wit that many teens can relate to, especially for those who grow up on the cheer squad (like me). This movie stars Kirsten Dunst as high school cheerleader Torrance Shipman, who begins her senior year as cheer captain of her team who's made first place in Cheer Nationals for six consecutive years. Eager to lead her team to victory for the seventh year, Torrance's effort to make it to Nationals becomes a hassle when she discovers their previous cheer captain Red (played by Lindsay Sloane) has been stealing routines from the East Compton High. With time running short and East Compton cheer captain Isis (played by Gabrielle Union) threatening to turn the tables on them, Torrance must come with a solid, original routine to compete in Cheer Nationals in Daytona. What do we have here? Another sports flick revolving around a high school team fighting to claim their victory for the championship title? Sure. Upon sitting through the hour mark, it is becomes almost thoroughly predictable what the final outcome would as the plot never quite goes beyond relying on typical sports clichés including the anxiety of making it the finals, or picking up a team that is suffering in the ruts. That is not say that the film doesn't leave any room for some sweet, feel-good humor to make up the Peyton Reed's formulaic direction. Most of the characters, particularly Kirsten Dunst's Torrance Shipman, are very likable and stand as effective sources for good laughs. While some of the jokes either don't quite land or fall under the category of clichéd, easily one of the most proficient aspects the story has going for it is capturing the spirit of high school angst including the lead character developing a discrete crush on one of her teammates' older brother. The cheer routine sequences however, are obviously the film's most stellar highlights, with the first hilarious, but botched cheer sequence setting the tone of the plot. There is also an inspiring message about teamwork handed throughout the plot. But honestly, is that really something new? In terms of performances, the cast is mostly solid but unsurprisingly nothing that stands out. Bring It On is fun, smart, and witty comedy that will very likely please teens and adults alike. Although this film isn't exactly on the A-list of teen comedies, it is definitely one that is fresh and stands out among lot of the other dumb and clichéd teen comedies today. This film is worth watching definitely worth watching with friends everywhere.",8,0,0,1 February 2016
Inception," This complex, yet riveting sci-fi thriller marks an innovative achievement by Christopher Nolan
","Inception is far from your average science-fiction thrill ride. Furthermore, it is difficult to narrow it down to a single genre. Visionary director Christopher Nolan drives an execution that results in a film that fulfills the traits a part-heist film, part-science fiction, part-action flick, and part-mystery. Yes, it may sound like a daunting task to juggle multiple sub-genres at once; particularly in a way that effectively incorporates a smart, coherent story. From his experience in 2008's 'The Dark Knight', Christopher Nolan has proved more than capable of generating an intelligent science-fiction piece that excels on both a visual and cerebral style while taking on complex themes such as the subconsciousness of the human mind and the danger of modern technology. In exhilarating efforts, Nolan successfully forms a solid cast and pulls both them and us into a extraordinary world brought to the life by his innovative visual style. This stars Leonardo Dicaprio as Dominic Cobb, a professional thief with a mysterious ability to enter inside the minds of other individuals and stealing ideas from their memory by falling in a state of subconsciousness, an ability that's held him in high ranks of corporate espionage. In attempt to erase his criminal past, Cobb is hired by businessman Saito (played by Ken Watanabe) to pull off a seemingly impossible task: plant an idea inside someone's mind. Accompanied by his partner Arthur (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), conman Eames (played by Tom Hardy), local forger Yusuf (played by Dileep Rao), and college student Ariadne (played by Ellen Page); Cobb must pursue their target corporate officer Robert Fischer (played by Cillian Murphy) pull off the daunting task while battling against the haunting visions of his late wife Mal Cobb (played by Marion Cotillard).Christopher Nolan is no stranger to challenging audiences on an cerebral level nor does he restrain from his dazzling visual grandeurs. This science-fiction mystery-action hybrid follows a complex plot that tackles on firm intellectual concepts of human psychology as it deals with characters engaging in a special ability to infiltrate the minds of others. The film's handling of this concept along with fear of technology playing a vital role results in an complicated cinematic piece with a heavy load on plot threads on it's shoulders. Ultimately, Christopher Nolan successfully operates on the narrative multiplex by exercising richly coherent storytelling and eye-popping action set pieces. Rather than mind hacking viewers with its intellectual complexity (similarly to 'Memento'), Nolan proceeds the plot with an effectively developed subplots, one emotionally concept involving the lead character coping with the death of his wife, the while strolling through a wide plethora of thrills. And Nolan leaves just enough room for some riveting action sequences energized with visually arresting chemistry. The biggest visual highlights are but not limited to the downtown environment folding into two, Joseph Gordon-Levitt sprawling through a hallway revolving at 360 degree circle, a slow-motion bus crash sequence along with a few 'how'd they do that?' scenes. As with Christopher Nolan, he doesn't indulge in a style-over-substance vibe nor utter explosiveness but instead delivers a mix bag of suspense, action, and enthralling mystery. In final results, Nolan beautifully brings an gorgeously imaginative world to life.Perhaps Christopher Nolan's only remote weakness in bringing his extraordinary world to life to forming more complex characters beyond our three-dimensional lead. Nonetheless, it's a pretty minor flaw. Suiting the lead role of the emotionally haunted Dominic Cobb is Leonardo Dicaprio who delivers solid emotionally gravitas and conviction with his performance. He stands greatly stands out among his likable charismatic ensemble not only in the acting department but partly due to his character being the the most emotionally involved character. Working along his side is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the lead character's accomplice who gets his fair share of both solid performance and visually stunning action participation, most notably the aforementioned hallway scene during the film's climax. Japanese actor Ken Watanabe bring a solid sense of sincerity as corporate executive Saito, a man with a mysterious personality mainly displayed during his first twenty minutes on screen. Tom Hardy gives a solid performance as conman Eames, but the manner in which his character is gives him nothing memorable to work with; the same can be interpreted for Dileep Rao as Yusuf. Academy-award nominated Ellen Page plays Ariadne, a young architect university student and she safely knock the ball out of the park. Sporting a sense of humanity and personality, Page suitably well amid the highly bankable cast. Cillian Murphy does fine balancing between a solid character and plot device. Lastly, there is the criminally underused Michael Caine, a frequent Christopher Nolan collaborator who doesn't a whole lot of screen time but gracefully makes the best his time on screen.Inception is complex, yet deeply riveting science-fiction heist flick that successfully entertains and challenges viewers on both a visual and cerebral level. In the best of words, it marks an innovative turn not for visionary Christopher Nolan but for the science-fiction genre. Furthermore, it stands tall that as an extraordinary picture that unlike many films of the genre, is vastly original.",10,1,3,17 December 2016
Lord of War," Although Lord of War propels with a somewhat uneven testament on international arms dealing, it is a compelling piece of work
","'There are 550 million firearms manufactured in a world circulation, that is one firearm for every twelve people on the planet' says Nicholas Cage's character in the opening scene. This political thriller boasting Andrew Niccol in the director's chair offers a significant, but somewhat convoluted testament on the tragic repurcussions of illegal arms dealing. The central figure in the story of a seemingly ordinary man who finds himself way over his head when he gets involved in a contraband arms dealing industry. As what many may know from reading the newspapers, arms dealing is a dirty business, and this film sheds some fair light on it. Although Niccol appears to show slightly more interest in pushing for a political agenda than telling a stimulating story, the story serves not as an angry condescension against arms dealing but a bold character study of a man wrestling with his inner demons as a result of his amoral business. Set in the 1980s during the final stretch of the Cold War, this film stars Nicolas Cage as Yuri Orlov, an Ukrainian native who makes a shot for the big bucks when he starts an contraband arms dealing business, selling a mass production of firearms to various international warzones around the globe. Bringing his cocaine addicted brother Vitaly (played by Jared Leto) along, Yuri quickly rises up the financial ladder with his selling, but soon must confront his morality when he finds himself in the crossfire of Interpol agent Jack Valentin (played by Ethan Hawke) who's pursuing after him. This movie tackles the area of the Cold War most films of the genre often neglect, and that is the politics that went outside the United States when many countries in the eastern hemisphere were at war and one of the major conflict dealt with exchange of international firearms. While the arms exchanging duty did lead to a helping hand for international defense, it also opened doors to tragedies that caused the lives of countless lives including children. This film focuses on the lead character's struggle against his morality when we witnesses the violent tragedies of countries at war, while experiencing a bold uproar in the law enforcement. Andrew Niccol does a fairly successful job at portraying the rise and fall of the lead character's dirty business, effectively exhibiting the violent consequences of arms dealing that puts him and his family in danger. But it is not the final half of the film when the story splashes into a somewhat uneven fiasco. There is a fair amount of substance and political commentary sprinkled throughout the two-hour picture, but perhaps it doesn't help that the narrative occasionally teeters towards the brink of uncertainty. The story ends on a rather ambiguous note that has a good capacity to leaving viewers with more questions about Yuri's morally dubious choices than answers.Nicolas Cage, Academy Award winner for his harrowing role in 'Leaving Las Vegas', does a pleasant job of showing his acting muscles in the lead role. His performance is solidly pleasant and shines a strong light on his talent. While his character may not fall in line with the category of a villain, there is no doubt that this role will provoke outrage for his ill morality that eventually leads to tragic consequences. Adding pinches of levity to the film's dark tone is Jared Leto who hops into the role of the lead character's younger brother Vitaly. Leto shines with a dose of humor nearly minute he is on screen, with his flamboyant behavior resulting from his compulsive cocaine addiction. While his comedic portrayal eventually overstays its welcome, Leto proves himself as a competent actor. Bridget Moynahan, suiting the role of Yuri's sexy lover and eventual wife, exhibits a decent performance for her time on screen. Then there is Ethan Hawke who takes on the role of an Interpol agent who rides on Yuri's tale upon discovering his unlawful business. His performance is quite strong and effectively shows his acting chops, nothing more nothing less. Lord of War is far from standing a cinematic masterpiece, but it is smart, if slightly flawed testament on illegal arms dealing. It is an ambitious picture that is bound spark plenty of interests and discussions long after its conclusion, at least for some who get the invested in its bleak subject matter. It is a dark picture, but it is an intriguing nonetheless. Best of all, it marks the spot of one of Nicolas Cage's best endeavors.",7,1,2,30 April 2017
Finding Dory," Finding Dory meets a fun, heartwarming return to one of Pixar's most classic features
","Pixar Animation Studios rarely falls short of beautiful, heartwarming features since their debut in 1995 when they delivered the revolutionary 'Toy Story'. Whether their biggest gem is their stellar technical abilities or their gift of bringing their heart-touching stories to life before our very eyes, Pixar never stops delivering the goods. Easily one of their most classic entries is director Andrew Stanton's 2003 feature 'Finding Nemo' which took audiences everywhere in an under-the-sea odyssey of a lovable clown fish in search of his lost son while acquiring the help of a funny, amnesiac blue tang. 13 years have passed and Pixar has managed to bring back most of our characters from the original and take us on another ride for relatively similar adventure. The biggest change here is unlike the predecessor which found Marlin and Dory searching for the young titular character, this one finds a new character in the Nemo's former position. And that is character is no one other than the lovable Dory, the fish suffering from her notorious short-term memory loss. Set one year after the events of the original, clown fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) and his son Nemo (voiced by Hayden Rolence) are home with the latter attending school and Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) being a helping hand with raising Nemo. Meanwhile, Dory is haunted by the memories of her family who she lost as a child, prompting her to set out to reunite with them. However, when she is unexpectedly kidnapped and placed in a Californian public aquarium, Marlin and Nemo was set out to rescue her.When the original hit theaters back in the spring of 2003, Dory is by far the biggest show-stealer of the feature. Bringing on non-stop hilarity with her short-term memory loss and constantly being a burden to Marlin's search of his son due to her inability to remembering anything longer than a few seconds, why wouldn't it be a good idea to explore deep into the origins of this lovable character? This film opens with a long flashback of Dory as a young child with her parents, and how her parents coped with her short-term memory loss which is handled surprisingly well. Rather than establishing Dory as a source of utter annoyance, the story maturely handles her mental predicament as sympathy. Some time later, she finds herself separated from her parents and struggling vigorously to find them. Afterwards, the film jumps to the present with her living with Marlin and Nemo from the previous entry and that is when the story finally kicks off. Like the original film, her amnesia still lingers and is constantly struggling trying to memorize simple things longer than a matter of seconds. But as the adventure begins and the characters making fateful efforts on helping her reunite with her long-lost family, the film not ingeniously handles her amnesiac disorder with substance but effectively established Dory as a self-aware burden who knows her mental disability causes trouble. And this easily stands as one of the most emotional and heartfelt elements of the story. There is plenty of fun (including a ridiculous car chase at the end) and certainly plenty of laughs to be handed on this adventure. And as this is Pixar, the film also holds a fair share of touching moments, though it never reaches the level of being a tear-jerker like 'Up' or the 'Toy Story' series.While we witness the return of our characters from the original entry (some of which are reserved for a post-credits scene), we also encounter a range of some new colorful characters along the way. First of which is Hank the Red Octupus (voiced by Ed O'Neill) who becomes a faithful companion for Dory on her wild adventure through the aquarium. Similarly to Dory, he provides a good share of laughter throughout his time on screen. Then there is some childhood friends of Dory including Destiny (voiced by Kaitlin Olsen) the Whale Shark and Bailey (voiced by Ty Burrell) the Beluga Whale who both become helping hands along the way. Idris Alba and Dominic West both provide the voices of sea lions who have a few good laughs but spend most of their time lying on a rock while hogging from a another sea lion in a comedic competition (they are not much help). Becky, a black-furred bird and piercing red eyes who doesn't provide much dialogue other than a series of loud squawks but also slips a few laughs for the kiddies. Each and every one the characters here are vastly likable and the film makes a rare surprise to providing a story without the presence of an actual villain (at least not in character form. With all great intentions, it works astoundingly well. And who can forget about the photo-realistic computer animation used to bring both the world and the characters to life.Finding Dory is a heartwarming animated adventure that delivers a surprisingly touching continuation to Pixar's classic 2003 original. This film is a joyful sure to please both children and adults alike. Predictably so, it may be not endure as memorably as it's predecessor. Regardless, it doesn't have to be. Anyone who enjoyed the previous film is almost guaranteed to enjoy this one without a single noticeable flaw.",9,0,7,8 January 2017
Arrival," Thoughtful and visceral in nearly every sense, Arrival makes for a breathtaking experience
","Arrival is far from your average science-fiction thriller. From the cinematic brilliance of director Denis Villenueve who's proved himself as a stellar filmmaking talent in 'Enemy', 'Prisoners', and 'Sicario', comes an intelligent sci-fi piece that ditches the typical special-effects action extravagant tropes in favor for some thought-provoking conceptions and mesmerizing visual storytelling. His efforts all come down to a story of extraterrestrials paying Earth a visit, a typical concept that leads you to believe the world has an full-scale invasion on their hands. This film however, is not quick to jump on that train. Instead, we are granted with a more thoughtful and emotional story focused more on the curiosity of this shocking event than an epic explosion-heavy fight between the two different species many sci-fi fanatics are often accustomed to. So this film follows Dr. Louise Banks (played by Amy Adams), a linguist professor who arrives at her class when she hears the worldwide news of a dozen alien spacepods that have landed in different locations throughout the globe leading millions of people around the world spiraling in panic and China's military preparing for war. She is soon approached by Colonol Weber (played by Forest Whitaker) who enlists her to help communicate with the aliens. Tasked alongside Ian Donnelly (played by Jeremy Renner), her mission to communicate with the extraterrestrials becomes a search for answers of a question the whole world is asking: Why are they here?Slipping in some credible influences to earlier science-fiction outings such as Steven Spielberg's 'Close Encounters of The Third Kind' and Robert Zemeckis's 'Contact', Denis Villenueve takes on a slightly more daunting task of mixing the sci-fi genre with solid realism and cerebral narrative heft to feed the audience into something more grounded and mind-bending than a string of explosive action-set pieces. The plot sets in within the first minutes when we are introduced to see strange looking alien ships descend around the world, and the media struggles trying make sense of this occurrence as countries everywhere are consumed in uncertainty and pondering on whether to remain calm or take military action. The real tension begins however, when Amy Adams is ascended into an alien ship to come face-to-face with their aliens via window. We watch as the grotesque-looking creatures express their language through use of circular patterns created by oozing some sort of ink on the window, and the mystery Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are investigating on these weird symbols mean in attempt to discover what their innovations are for presence on Earth. These scenes are equally breathtaking and smart to the point leaving viewers squirming with both curiosity and fear, while embracing the visual resonance that defines the film's beauty. As the story goes on and the fate of humanity rest of the characters' shoulders, Villenueve drives it on an emotional atmosphere that demands the viewers for questions and provokes fear not from what we know, but what we don't know. This all comes down to a revelation that is not destined to be impressive, but at least smart in some degree.There is much more than the handy screenplay by Eric Heisserer that guides the film into a smart, mind-bending atmosphere, the film also boasts its visual beauty in the technical department. One of the major elements is the cinematography. Roger Deakins who flourished some dazzling cinematography in Denis Villenueve's previous outings 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario' is sadly absent from this collaboration with Villenueve. Fortunately, his place substituted by Bradley Young who demonstrated some solid camera work in 'A Most Violent Year' and 'Selma', and his fine cinematography deliver some camera work that can falls nothing short of breathtaking. Capturing long lingering shots of the alien space pod floating above the ground, Young's cinematography grants use with an electrifying (and occasionally jarring) look at the atmosphere surrounding the space pod and the sight is incredibly beautiful to look at. Furthermore, it all feels very believable enough to where you can almost feel uncertainty of the characters as they approach the mysterious sightings. Lastly, one of the astounding aspects of the film is by far Amy Adams in the lead role. She delivers incredible humanity to the character to the point of not feeling like one, but a normal human being looking for answers. If you were dazzled by what we delivered in films like 'American Hustle' or 'The Master' Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker who step foot in the supporting are both very credible here as well, even though they don't veer to far in the spotlight as lead Amy Adams.Arrival is thoughtful science-fiction piece that blesses viewers with one of the most visceral cinematic experiences of the year, and shows director Denis Villenueve on the road to the front ranks of American filmmakers. Though the slow pace is enough to frustrate some movie goers looking for something more exciting and less busy with high-classed ideas, there is no doubt that this makes for a remarkable experience.",9,7,17,19 November 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful picture brimming with an uncompromising heart and melancholy
","Based on the acclaimed novella by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is a film burning with a certain sense of triumph that is rarely experience in any cinematic effort. It is a drama that stops at just about nothing to grab at your heart while feasting it with a strong human touch. This effort is accomplished by director Frank Durabont who, in his directorial debut, grasps on a powerful hold on the spirit of Stephen King's original source material. Taking from the pages of the novella of the same name, the film sets its action inside the walls of the federal penitentiary, a dark place where some of the most innocent people are incarcerated while they hopelessly watch as they are robbed of their humanity at the hands of the unpleasant nature within the prison. While some are thrown in prison for their lack of innocence, others lose their innocence while serving their time within the barbed wire fences and rusty cells. The primary focus of this bleak, yet triumphant tale, however, is the man who vows to fight against this tragedy. Set in 1947, this film follows Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), a man sentenced to forty years in prison after wrongly being accused of the murder of his cheating wife and his lover. Stationed at the Shawshank Prison in New England under the watchful eye of religious bible-thumping Warden Norton (played by Bob Gunton), Andy is forced to deal with the harsh reality of the prison life, but soon finds a glimmer of hope when he forms a bond with fellow prisoner under the nickname Red (played by Morgan Freeman) who claims to be innocent. Following his years in prison, Andy seeks for redemption and decency among his fellow prisoners while struggling to survive against the unpleasant lifestyle uprooted by Norton. One thing everyone in that prison has in common is that they are all innocent, at least according to Red in a scene upon meeting Andy for the first time. But does he truly mean? That question lies within the story as it proceeds through a long, yet thoughtful process of establishing the emotional nature of the characters and the soul- crushing environment that has them shaken to their cores. But as Red states, 'you become use to it'. Whether one can agree with Red's claims or not, it is his wisdom that establishes him as a character with an emotional force to reckoned with. And kudos can be given to Frank Durabont's absorbing script, this character would not the shining light he is without the outstanding performance by Morgan Freeman who amplifies the role is just enough emotional magnitude to tap at the heart, while also dominating the film with his narration. The bond between him and Tim Robbins strikes the chord in more ways than one, especially with Robbins embracing the role with pure grit. Andy is a tragic character who is forced to come to terms with the reality that innocence is lost regardless of when it is in your control, and that leaving does not always mark the end of your tragedy. One character in the film is forced to learn that the hard way in one heartbreaking sequence. The film never grabs at your heart with strangling you with forced sentimentality, it just allows its emotions to run wild while sprinkling small bursts of humor to occasionally lighten the tone. In the midst of the melancholy at defines the atmosphere, there is a powerful sense of hope that Andy will not let the prison become the thief of his dignity nor his humanity, particularly at the hands of Bob Gunton's Warden Norton, a corrupt individual tainted with his religious hypocrisy. How can one trust a man who shoves his bible in their face, yet expresses himself in such an inhuman manner? And for a technical standpoint, shout-outs go to Roger Deakins for his profound cinematography to capture the nature of each scene from start to finish. The Shawshank Redemption is a triumphant cinematic effort brimming with an uncompromising heart and sense of humanity within its roots. It is powerful picture that will leave you heartfelt one moment, then leave you choked up within the next. That is just an example how magnificent director Frank Durabont is at gripping you with such a strong human touch. Worthy of the name 'masterpiece'? I definitely think so.",10,0,0,6 September 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Maybe not would I consider Best Picture of The Year, but it is true cinematic artwork
","The Hollywood industry is a place full of mind-boggling mysterious and complexities, as well as a place where fame of America's most glamorized celebrities are uprooted; and director Alejandro G. Inarritau delivers a powerful vision on this concept. This artistic 116- minute character study allows for audiences not just to experience a colorful story of a washed-up actor's rise from rags to riches, or it's cast of A-list actors shine with highly charismatic performances; but also some awe-inspiring social commentary tackling the rocky world of celebrities in the showbiz. The final product is a film that not only sees the actors expand upon their incredible cinematic abilities, but an inspiring innovation uprooted by Inarritau's gorgeously smart direction. Birdman: Or(The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) stars Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomsan, a formerly popular Hollywood actor known for his iconic as 'Birdman' in a popular superhero franchise, who has been facing troubles with his career and his divorced by his wife Sylvia (played by Amy Ryan). In attempt to reignite his career, Thomson is chosen to direct a play at Broadway with the help of his lawyer Jake (played by Zach Galifianakis) and his pot-addicted daughter Sam (played by Emma Stone). His job only ends up more difficult than he expected when he not only must work with hard-headed actor Mike Shiner (played by Edward Norton), but also battle his inner demons that have put a major that unsoundly made a mess of his career.This engrossing dramedy doesn't exactly break any cinematic barriers, but I would be lying if I said this isn't an inspiring cinematic experience. This film was very decent. Although I didn't find it be what I consider the best film of the year, I was pretty enthralled with it. Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Zach Galifianakis, and Edward Norton are all given their time to shine here, and the sheer commitment they display on screen is virtually impossible to ignore. Michael Keaton's plays what can easily be seen as a meta-role as the main character is drawn as formally praised actor who rose to fame starring as a popular caped crusader known as 'Birdman' which falls eerily coincidental to Keaton's real-life career as Batman during the early years of his career. In addition, the performance he lands in this role is truly uncompromising and engaging from start to finish. It is genuinely hard to think of any other actor would nail this role better than Keaton. Along side this fine actor is Edward Norton playing a volatile actor with a glamorous reputation onstage, but a prickly attitude behind the scenes. His role serves almost as an analogy of his real-life persona offscreen (though not in a way that's meant to be a parody of himself), and the performance he brings to the table is nothing short of fascinating. With his lack of roles over the last a few years, he seemed he might have flown off the map, but luckily this sees him in a triumphant return. Emma Stone, playing the drug-addicted daughter of Michael Keaton's protagonist, also takes some good time to impress with her immersive talent.While the cast manages to fascinate in the acting department, the film hits its highest notes on a technical scale which is accomplished by the astounding beautiful cinematography by Emmanuel Lubetzki who demonstrated some engrossing talent in Alfonso Cuaran's 'Children of Men' along with 'Gravity'. With the film pervading with only sixteen visible shots throughout it's near two-hour runtime, viewers watch as the cast takes a daunting task of sustaining strong and powerful performances through a short of series of long, uninterrupted shots lasting roughly 19 minutes. It shows that Alejandro G. Inarritau out in some great, extensive time for the cast to rehearse. Though the cinematography isn't what I would say groundbreaking, it is incredibly admirable and easily the film's biggest gem. In terms of the narrative, the film provides a sweet, engaging story of man's journey through the showbiz; complete with masterfully written script and three- dimensional characters. Though the story succeeds on providing some nifty commentary on the entertainment industry including the downfall of fame, the overwhelming effects falling center to the public spotlight, and criticism by film critics; the story isn't always as interesting as it's intended. Sure, there are plenty of moments of light-hearted humor and appropriate ingenuity, but the film also some moments of tediousness. But with Inarritau's stylish direction in driving the film, these flaws aren't too hard to forgive. Birdman is a solidly entertaining piece of cinema sparked with Alejandro G. Inarritau's engaging direction, some powerhouse performances by a larger-than-life cast, and an overall powerful artistic value. Though it may offer much groundbreaking innovation beyond the technical scale, it is true demostration of director Inarritau's talent as well as the cast; and as a result earns a spot as one of the best movies of 2014.",8,0,2,5 July 2015
The Big Short," Top-notch, entertaining, but at the same time infuriating look at the economic collapse
","After his work with Will Ferrell on the wild laugh-out-loud comedies such as 'Anchorman', 'Step Brothers', and 'The Other Guys'; Adam McKay is one of the last people you would expect to take on a dramatic and particularly complex subject. Much to surprise, his efforts on adapting Michael Lewis's novel 'The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine', revolving around the 2007 financial crisis pays off shockingly well, featuring a powerful cast, a stunning screenplay by Charles Randolph, and McKay's overall strong direction. Christian Bale plays Michael Burry, a hedge fund manager of a Manhattan bank who spends his days in office in shorts barefoot, playing drums on his knees, and blaring heavy metal on his radio. Upon examining the country's financial records, Michael predicts that the housing market will collapse in 2008 . In response, he makes a massive bet against the country's economy and begins tossing millions to credit swaps. His actions gain the attention of Wall Street investor Jared Vennett (played by Ryan Reynolds), and the quick-tempered hedge fund specialist Mark Baum (played by Steve Carroll), along with several other investors. This strategy leads Michael and fellow investors to strong wealth, while the economy takes a turn for the worst.Director Adam McKay makes a crucial point in this dramedy centered on the corruption of the financial business and how the devastating effects it had on the country's economy, while balancing a comedic undertone to lighten the dramatic subject matter. As this film is inspired by true events, it showcases the story on how the housing market was in critical condition and the ignorant actions these bankers took in response to the discovery. Then the film progresses into great detail on how the bankers lead themselves to fortunes while millions of families are left unemployed and losing their homes. With this done by powerful writing by Charles Randolph, what results is a film that is both entertaining, but at the same time effective enough to cause outrage in viewers, particularly those who were effected by the economic collapse. When the characters are introduced, viewers begin with believing them as heroes before the film progresses into their fateful actions, revealing them to be ill role models and difficult to root for. By then, the film becomes more emotional and effecting, while managing to carrying out a comedic undertone. Some scenes will have you laughing, while other scenes will have growing a strong emotional and occasionally anger feel.This film does a magnificent job on touching the significance of the financial business and the consequences of the greed in these bankers, though it sometimes a bit too hard to explain the structures of the bank operations to where viewers who aren't too educated may struggle to comprehend but teaches you valuable information about money investing. Plenty of dialogue dealing with mortgage rates, stock funds, and other complex terms by Christian Bale who gives off a purely outstanding performance, Steve Carroll who pulls off another powerful performance, and Ryan Gosling who plays a Wall Street investor with great complexity, and the film at times feels the need to dumb it down by the character breaking the fourth wall, including a short cameo by Margot Robbie and a rather odd one by Selena Gomez explaining the process of gambling. Breaking the fourth wall is a bit overused here, but does works effectively at times. Then there is Brad Pitt as a financial adviser who is not giving too much screen time, but serves a significant role in the plot with diligence. These actors really strive in their roles, and play a highly solid aspect in the film.The Big Short is top-notch and entertaining that embraces its complicated subject with wittiness and intelligence, and will leave viewers captivated and at the same time, angry at learning the poor decisions that played a factor in the crash of our economy, at least for those who are able to understand it. The film is fantastically directed, powerfully acted, and definitely one of the best written films recently.",8,1,1,21 March 2016
Platoon," Thoroughly brutal, but effective portrayal of the Vietnam War
","The Vietnam War is a conflict that garnered tremendous controversy as many condemned the war as a futile and lead to what people called needless lost of thousands of American lives. The purpose of the war was to the fight against communism, a long going threat occurring during the decades of the Cold War. Director Oliver Stone who was a Vietnamese War veteran himself makes a brutal, but utterly effective portrayal in this war drama based on his experiences in the Vietnamese battlefields. Charlie Sheen plays Chris Taylor, a young man in his late teens who drops out of college and voluntary for active duty in Vietnam. With no combat experience compared to the other men in his platoon including the hot-tempered Staff Sergeant Robert Barnes (played by Tom Berenger), the more kind- heart Sergeant Elias (played by William Defoe), the aggressive and ruthless Lieutenant Wolfe (played by Mark Moses), and fellow African-American Big Harold (played by Forest Whitaker); Chris faces the dehumanizing effects of the war and the moral dilemmas of men in active combat as the platoon fight their through the grueling environment and atmosphere of the Vietnamese battle front.War is ugly, and this movie certainly shows it. Shooting the film in the Phillipines which serves as an authentic backdrop of wartime Vietnam, Oliver Stone uses his experiences in active combat and puts into grueling prospective, giving viewers on a haunting and gritty taste of the horrors and atrocities that ignited during the years of active duty in Vietnam. From the bloody and gruesome combat sequences, to the deteriorating psychological health of the fellow soldiers, to the loss of innocence in humanity in the characters; Oliver Stone pulls no punches when expressing the reality of what the deadly conflict overseas was like with convicted realism and powerful emotions. One scene in particular features a raid in the Vietnamese village where members of the platoon, Lieutenant Wolfe in particular torture innocent civilians and the way they treat these civilians is an eye-sore and quite unsettling to watch. Most importantly, it shows the psychological impact on Charlie Sheen's character and his fellow comrades and they become robbed of their moral compass. It is a real powerful issue that goes on in active combat today, soldiers overseas are pitted with not only their desperate feat to survive and protect their country but dealing with their ethical sense. The story focuses not exactly active combat itself but the effects it has the soldiers, and the story progresses through how the main character changes as person, a character who you come to care about. Charlie Sheen gives an incredible performance, easily one of the best if not the best roles in his career. And let's not forget William Defoe, an actor who isn't well known for placing good guy roles, yet manages to show pure charisma and humanity in his character; and Tom Berenger as Sergeant Barnes, a soldier with a cold heart against the both his comrades and the Vietnamese.Platoon is brutal, violent, and quite disturbing to sit through, but it is very effective and honest in portraying the horrors of the Vietnam War. Oliver Stone does a tremendous job on capturing the brutality of the hellish environment of active combat. His directorial efforts pay off and the cast is outstanding. This movie would make a great pick for anyone in the mood of a powerful war flick.",9,4,5,7 April 2016
Scream," A clever and original slasher-horror flick that reinvented the horror genre
","In the 1970s and 80s, Hollywood treated us with amazing slasher- horror flicks such as The Last House on The Left (1973), Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), and other lesser noticed slasher films. At the dawn of the 90s, the slasher genre was dying as Hollywood was failing to come up with anything new and was repeatedly recycling the same formula of the genre. This was until Wes Craven resurrected the genre with this unique, self-aware, teen- horror slasher film that parodies its genre with new elements, new twists, and new scares that many horror fans were not expecting. This film stars Neve Campbell as Sidney Scott, a 17-year old high school girl traumatized by the murder of her mother, who begins being stalked by a masked killer who begins taking the lives of her fellow school mates. Sound familiar? Just wait! The teenagers learn to survive against the killer's onslaught by using advice from horror movies by learning how characters in the movies become victims.Featuring a cast of Skeet Ulrich, Jamie Kennedy, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Drew Barrymore, this movie drifts away from the typical slasher-horror clichés and comes up with new elements. Instead of having the characters make unwise decisions by failing to run out the door to safety while being chased it a killer, this film creates characters who are aware of their mistakes that characters from other horror films make and realize why the killer is after them. Like many horror fans, they also manage to point out every cliché that happens in a slasher movie like characters who are virgins end up surviving or how characters die because they fail to run out the front door instead of random places in the house. Basically, this movie is about teenagers who get killed from making a whole new set of unwise decisions. Neve Campbell does the great job as the main character. Then there is Skeet Ulrich who plays Billy Loomis, her clingy boyfriend, and Jamie Kennedy who plays Randy Meeks who is a huge move buff and is well educated on what goes on in horror movies. Many scenes where he makes references to other horror movies and establishes a set of rules in order to survive against a masked killer. These rules include: do not have sex, do not drink or do drugs, and do not 'I'll be right back' before leaving somewhere. He is one of those characters who is really smart and has knowledge on how to survive a horror movie. Then there is the rest of the cast who demonstrate some great acting skills. Scream is one of the most original and clever horror movies. Like many slashers, it has the blood and gore that many gore fans come to appreciate. Overall, this movie succeeds at avoiding most (if not all) of the clichés that many horror films are known for. This is probably the best movie by Wes Craven in his career.",9,0,0,5 September 2015
Prometheus," Visually captivating and riveting with thoughtful ambition, Prometheus is a triumphant science-fiction endeavor
","The Alien franchise boasted a promising start in 1979 when the first film was debuted by Ridley Scott. But that promise only seemed to move just a few step forward when James Cameron came into the picture to unleash the powerful follow-up in 1986. Since then, the once mighty sci-fi/horror franchise seems to have fallen in the ruts with a series of unappetizing sequels. Ridley Scott however, makes a triumphant return to the franchise with this quasi-prequel to the original film, delivering a visually striking and intellectually rich origin story of the franchise's chronology. Drifting away from familiar elements and venturing into fresh new territory, Scott serves the mastermind behind science-fiction thriller; tackling on thoughtful ideas including creationism and evolution of human life, while operating on a gripping narrative scope. Set in 2093, this film follows a crew of scientists aboard a spaceship known as Prometheus, who set out to a distant planet to discover artifacts that will open doors to the discover of the origins of mankind. Consisting of Captain Janek (played by Idris Alba), archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (played by Noomi Repace), human-like android David (played by Michael Fassbender), Shaw's love interest Charlie Holloway (played by Logan-Marshall Green), and corporate CEO Peter Weyland (played by Guy Pearce), the crew conducted by mission commander Meredith Vickers (played by Charlize Theron) soon make a sinister to threatens the lives of not only themselves but all the human race. The film does not come without its problems, particularly when examining the script by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof. But arguably the bigger flaw plaguing the thrilling experience is the film concluding with more unanswered questions than desired. There are some significant moments that are bound to leave viewers scratching their heads, hungry of explanations. Nevertheless, Ridley Scott makes an effective comeback to the franchise by not only introducing a new route but also experimenting with much more intellectual ideas than what we were used to in the past. As this is a Ridley Scott picture, the film shines with a gorgeous visual style from the interior of the spaceship Prometheus, to the nifty production design of otherworldly planet. Shall I mention the costume designs worn by the crew? The plot on the other hand, marks the film's biggest strength along with its biggest weakness. Focusing on a story premature to the franchise's familiar timeline, the primary concern here is a team of scientists venturing to an another world to discovering the foundation of the human race, unaware of the ugly forces that await them. This concept open doors to some thought- provoking discussions of creationism and evolution, with the characters tackling on the perplexing philosophy of extraterrestrial being the founders of mankind as opposed to the idea of creationism which is widely favored by the Christian community. Sure, it is a concept that God believers are likely to take offense. Nonetheless, it is hard to argue the ambition behind the story's intellectual heft. Beneath it all, there are some scary and even gory moments sprinkled throughout the pictured. One of which involves a surgical precedure that can be tough to watch if you developed a weak stomach for the chest-bursting scene in 'Alien'.Surround the slickly paced and alluring atmosphere is an all-star cast who all manage to bring their A-game in their roles. Acquiring the most screen time in the predictably large cast is Noomi Repace. Like many of Ridley Scott's films, there is always room for a strong female character. Playing Elizabeth Shaw, an archaeologist who happens to be a believer in God and is skeptical about the whole mind-boggling idea of aliens being mankind's birthgiver, Repace absorbs the role with a great amount of fortitude and humanity. If there is anything she earns that the nearly the rest of the cast doesn't, it is a more powerful character development. While her character never levels up beyond a two-dimensional state, she manages to stand out among the crowd of the underdeveloped figures. Idris Alba, the captain of the crew, makes good use of his role. Charlize Theron, playing mission commander Meredith Vickers, boasts a fair amount of compulsion. Guy Pearce and Logan-Marshall Green are fine, but nothing that leaves a strong impact. Michael Fassbender on the other hand, delivers an incredible portrayal as David, the android. His stoic delivery including his facial expression firmly match the robotic nature of his underwritten character. Prometheus is a visually captivating sci-fi endeavor, riveting with thoughtful concepts and an ambitious direction by visionary Ridley Scott. And most importantly, it stands as an applauding return for the blemished Alien franchise. While the film excels on both a narrative and visual scope along with serving as an admirable relative to the Alien films, it is critical for moviegoers who are expecting a carbon copy of the previous entries to go in low expectations to avoid sheer disappointment.",8,1,5,26 May 2017
Halloween," John Carpenter's Halloween demonstrates a solid classic horror piece at its finest
","The late 80s was the age of numerous slasher horror films that later elevated into long-running franchises of far less superior sequels. John Carpenter's classic horror piece is the movie that raised wide influence of psychotic serial killers dressed in a mask and dispatching their victims of bladed weapons. Although Halloween was not the first slasher flick to hit the celluloid as the genre dates back to Alfred Hitchcock's classic 'Psycho', it is the film that set the bar of entries of the genre. The film is a spine-chiller from the opening moments when we are introduced to the psychotic killer Michael Myers, and the moments to follow are a series of sequences set to pull audiences into in dark, scare-your-heart-out frenzy where suspense is the key and the pacing moves at a reasonable speed. And if John Carpenter proves something crucial, it is that blood and gore, which stands as a staple of slasher pictures is only a bonus and not a necessity. This film opens up in 1963 where we meet Michael Myers, a mentally disturbed youngster who murders his parents and sister on Halloween night and is sent to live in a mental asylum. Fast forward to fifteen years, we meet high school teen Laurie (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) who is asked to babysit her neighbor's young daughter Lindsay (played by Kyle Richards) and son Tommy (played by Brian Andrews). What starts off as a normal, peaceful night turns into a Halloween nightmare when Michael Myers (played by Nick Castle) escapes the mental asylum and begins stalking Laurie and her friends. And the worst part is, he has a knife and mask and is ready to murder them. John Carpenter, director and writer, knows how to keep viewers shivering in their seat when things begin to go south. The minute the masked killer arrives on the scene, the atmosphere quickly boils, daring viewers to lean at the edge of their seats. If there is anything that the simple story falls short of, it is depth to what went wrong in the killer's background to turn him into the psychotic maniac. We are left to believe that he is just mentally ill. However, the film does not have time to dive into detail. It's main purpose is to scare the pants off of viewers, and with Carpenter's method on shooting each scene, generating sheer suspense, and warming the atmosphere with his eerie piano score that has now become iconic; it effectively gets the job done. Compared to most slasher flicks, this one is very tame on gore, so the graphic aftermath of the killer slaying his victims is mostly to your imagination. Carpenter's effective stabs piercing us with hair- raising scares brilliantly establishes the vulnerability of Jamie Lee Curtis's character as she is chased by the masked heathen. The only downside is Curtis's performance which, by today's standards, really did not age well and feels slightly below the bar of a solid performance. But there are just enough goods throughout the picture to forgive her for that. After all, Carpenter knows his way around the genre.Halloween stands as a solid horror film that takes the crown on influencing many slasher projects of the 1980s, even if it is not the most glamorous entry of the horror genre. For an appropriate film to watch over the Halloween holiday, this movie bears a satisfying choice for those hungry for a good scare, if nothing more.",8,0,0,31 October 2017
Wonder Woman," Exhilarating superhero spectacle from start to finish, Wonder Woman is an entertaining hit
","After suffering from two cinematic misfires 'Batman Vs. Superman' and 'Suicide Squad', the DC cinematic universe has managed to find light at the end of the tunnel with this exhilarating superhero action spectacle Wonder Woman. Needless to say, the hype for this one is high. Introduced in the aforementioned Batman Vs. Superman and set to appear in the upcoming DC hype 'Justice League', the eponymous superhero is treated with a stunning cinematic experiment that brings more than just eye-popping visual heft and a pulse- pounding narrative. It firmly embraces the dazzling nature of the titular hero from the comic books without leaving out room for some political themes and a surprising emotional heft many entries of the widely popular genre neglect. This is all brought beautifully together by director Patty Jenkins, first female director behind a superhero flick in history. Furthermore, it marks the first female-centric superhero flick since the horribly panned 'Elektra' twelve years ago. This film follows Diane (played by Gal Gabot), a young lady born and raised by her mother Queen Hippolyta (played by Connie Nielson) on an island entirely inhabited of women. Upon saving Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine), a British pilot who crash lands into the ocean, Diane grows eager to help fight as a warrior in the European front during World War I. Against her mother's wishes, Diane sets out with Steve to Europe the defeat the God of War Ares who they believe the cause behind this tragic war -- all while becoming the famous Wonder Woman in the process.Whereas 'Captain America: The First Avenger' set its titular hero in the era of World War II, this one sets its hero in the height of World War I, the war that many referred to as 'the war to end all wars'. With the Great War serving as the backdrop of the plot, this open doors to some surprisingly clever themes surrounding the titular character and the atmosphere. As with many superhero movies, this one kicks off with an origin story showcasing Diane's upbringing in a world dominated by women, and her inspiration of becoming a warrior following her encounter with Steve Trevor followed by her family's harrowing attack by the German Army. The premise along the long journey that follows is greatly strewn together by themes of women empowerment, a political issue that ran rampant during the World War I era. Without overarching the story, the political themes and the story's ideology about mankind being the catalyst of war nicely fuel the versatility of the plot, especially when the hero and Steve Trevor come to the epiphany towards the end. Furthermore, the chemistry between Gal Gabot's Wonder Woman and Chris Pine's Steve Trevor is genuine and, unlike many action flick, never drags into ham-fisted territory. Both of their performances are swell, particularly Gabot who boasts great versatility in the lead role. And the humor, which pokes fun at the feminist themes throughout the picture, is surprisingly clever, if occasionally awkward. Like in many superhero entities, the action sequences which consists of a prolonged fight sequence on a rugged German battlefield, a fight sequence on a beach, and the final climatic battle at the end are all visually impressive and exhilarating to watch. The final fight sequence in particular sets stone to unexpected emotional resonance, while splashing the screen with abundance of colorful CGI -- more better or worse. Wonder Woman is a spectacular superhero action thrill ride from beginning to end, and represents nearly everything that makes a superhero movie entertaining. It is a film that defies against the disappointment of the DC cinematic universe's previous entries and marks a game changer for the DC comics' cinematic cosmos. It is not a perfect picture, but it is certainly one that is more than worth seeing.",9,12,25,2 June 2017
Straight Outta Compton," Gripping and powerful portrayal of a legendary rap group
","It was 1987 when the legendary rap group N.W.A took the nation by storm with their astonishing hardcore rap performances that redefined the genre of rap. This gripping and powerful biopic tells the story of the five young men: Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins) Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr, Ice Cube's real-life son), Easy-E (Jason Mitchell), MC Ren (Aldis Hodge) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.), growing up in the ghetto streets of Compton, California, and forming their rap band known as N.W.A. With the help of their manager Jerry Heller (played by Paul Giamatti), the group becomes an smash-hit success and begin performing on a nationwide tour. While the group makes their way into massive fame, they also become a target to the law enforcement agency who condemns their music as acts of defiance. This film follows how this group on their success and how they left a long-lasting legacy on the music industry.The story behind this genre-defining rap group is quite fascinating and definitely deserves a movie deal. This film brings an incredible amount of energy to the story, and the narrative is so riveting and engaging that it strongly grabs your attention. It begins with the five young men who are struggling with their home lives and having frequent run-ins with law authorities and gang members, and it authentically depicts their lives in the violent streets of Compton. The best example would shown in an unnerving scene with Ice Cube on the school bus. The story then dives into the start of the group's career. As the story goes on, we watch as the characters rise to fame, but then gain unwanted attention by the law enforcement agency in the process. The agency becomes highly offended by their music, claiming it to influence gangs, violence, and crime, and begin taking legal actions on the group as well as their manager. The group responds by claiming that their music reflects on the reality that they are living in. The film has some comedic moments and dialogue that will have you laughing, then there are some dramatic moments that could have you choked up as well as some thought- provoking moments like the depiction of the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the beating of Rodney King.The cast brings some outstanding performances as the N.W.A members. I was particularly impressed with O'Shea Jackson Jr, who is the real- life son of Ice Cube. It's very interesting to see him portray his father. The cast brings such incredible energy to their characters with not only their acting, but their rapping performances; especially during the scenes when they performing live. The film's soundtrack really leaves a strong impact, particularly the song 'F@#% Da Police'.Straight Outta Compton is quite a powerful film and maybe one of the most captivating biopic films I've seen in a long time. Complete with superb performances, enthralling storytelling, and a killer soundtrack, this movie is certainly a must-see and guaranteed to do huge at the box office. Even if you are not a fan of the band or the rap genre in general, this film is still worth your attention.",10,8,43,30 August 2015
Vanilla Sky," Unnecessarily convoluted and tedious romantic thriller
","Director Cameron Crowe takes a wild and overly complex turn in this mind-bending thriller that demonstrates the complexity and elements of the human mind that many struggle to understand. Tom Cruise stars as David Aimes, a wealthy, inner city publisher and best friend of Brian Shelby (played by Jason Lee), who is in relationship with beautiful blonde Julie (played by Cameron Diaz), but seems to be in love with a Latino woman named Sofia (played by Penelope Cruz). When David is involved in a devastating car accident with Julie that leaves his face horribly disfigured, he begins struggling to tell between dream and reality. Kurt Russell plays psychology doctor McCabe who has David incarcerated and interrogated him on the events leading up to the fateful car wreck. Mixing elements of science-fiction, mystery, and romance, this film is a remake of the 1997 Spanish film Open Your Eyes, which also stars Penelope Cruz and follows the same story structure. As interesting as the plot and the premise are, I really wanted to like this movie. While I am not saying I hated this movie, there were some major flaws that made this one hard to enjoy. The film sets a promising start with a solid introduction of the characters of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee, and Penelope Cruz. Then there is the intense car crash scene that leaves Tom Cruise's character with a horrendous facial disfigurement. From there on, the plot takes a whole bunch of of twists and turns that are far too confusing for not only the audience to understand, but the confusing for the film itself. This film tries so hard to be interesting but is completely unaware of the direction its trying to take, and it fails to give any sort of hints to what happens and instead leaves the audience consisting speculating. The plot feels like Cameron Crowe took the script and did some experimenting with it but got everything all mixed up. Throughout the story, there some questions left unanswered and scenes that serve no purpose. The cast's performances are decent, but perhaps nothing too impressive. Vanilla Sky has an intriguing plot and a premise. Overall, this is not a film for everyone and only for those who are fans of Cameron Crowe's works. While it's not totally bad, it would have been better if it the plot was more even and had a better and more structured direction.",6,1,2,25 October 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Iconic DC heroes dual in a middling action thriller with significant flaws
","It's that time of the year again when superheroes make their way to the big screen and earn a killer receipt at the box office. This long awaited DC Comics based action thriller directed by Zack Snyder who left in good impression with the Superman reboot 'Man of Steel' in the summer of 2013, pits two of DC Comics' iconic heroes into a epic battle full of flashy visual effects and adrenaline-fueled action sequences. This movie takes place eighteen months after the events of Man of Steel when Clark Kent/Superman defeated General Zod. After the massive destruction and countless of innocent lives lost in Metropolis as a result of the battle, Superman (played by Henry Cavill) has become a victim of scrutiny by public who consider him more of a threat than a hero. Bruce Wayne/Batman believes Superman should pay for his reckless actions and the result is an epic rivalry between the two heroes. Meanwhile, evil scientist Lex Luther (played by Jesse Eisenberg) hatches up a diabolical plan that could be the world's worst nightmare. This long awaited movie had so much potential, and was on its way to great start and getting the DC Cinematic Universe caught up with Marvel's popularity status. Sadly, this movie only succeeds in its moderate standards and fails to live up near its full potential. The major flaws come almost entirely from the first half when we are introduced to the premise of the aftermath of the battle between Superman and General Zod, and the controversy surrounding Superman. The plot takes the first hour diving deep into the politics of the wrangle on how Superman is believe to be a threat to society, and not only progresses at an unnecessarily slow pace but leaves many unanswered details that seem to be significant to the story. The movie spends way too much time developing its exposition and not enough time with the main plot that it becomes less interesting as the story progresses. Another flaw comes from the choppily edited scenes that seem to come non-stop, and the results is questions left unanswered. It is not until the second half when the movie gains its appeal of excitement, starting from the long anticipated battle between the two titular characters, to the dazzling introduction of Wonder Woman (played by Gal Cabot), to the intense climatic battle at the end. Filled with spectacular action and visual effects that pack a strong punch, the final hour manages to the deliver above its sluggish first hour with pure excitement along with some emotional investment.Now lets get into the performances. Henry Cavill remains good as ever in the role of Superman/Clark Kent since his debut in the role in 'Man of Steel'. Ben Affleck makes a surprisingly good impression as the new Batman/Bruce Wayne with a nicely updated costume and good commitment to the role. While he certainly doesn't level up to what Christian Bale brought as Batman to the Dark Knight trilogy, he definitely doesn't fail to satisfy. Amy Adams makes her return as Clark Kent's love interest Lois Lane and does fine job, despite being little more than a constant damsel in distress frequently throughout the picture. Jesse Eisenberg playing Lex Luthor on the other hand, could really use some improvement. As Luthor is supposed to be the villain, he's expected to be portrayed in a dark, sinister. Instead, Eisenberg gives off a more over-the-top Joker vibe that works in some scenes, but comes off a bit silly in other scenes. I really don't think he's the best actor for this role, but for all I can say, his performance is at least fine.Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice is a bit of a middling superhero action flick that manages to succeed in some parts, but fails significantly in other parts. This movie is not I was hoping and left me in somewhat disappointment. However, it is not to say that this film isn't worth watching but a film that is a bit go-for-broke and will satisfy only some fans, but disappoint others. And there is no doubt that this film will definitely succeed highly at the box office for its mass anticipation. This film is not awful, but it just doesn't live up near its potential.",5,1,2,25 March 2016
Tombstone," Beautifully engaging with magnificent performances by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer
","Labeling this biopic-based western epic directed by George P. Cosmatos a classic may feel somewhat of an overstatement, but with engaging storytelling by Kevin Jarre and lively performances by such a likable cast (most notably Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer); it almost feels like one. With the Golden Age of Hollywood several decades in the rear-view mirror and the glory days of western actors like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood in the past, it seems the livelihood of the western genre has been slowly dying out with a progressing shortage of memorable or even engaging westerns outings looming year after year. However, this 90s biopic centering on the story of western lawman Wyatt Earp shows good proof that though the western genre is running low on fuel, its not out of the game yet. Set in the 1800s American West, this film tells the story of former lawmen Wyatt Earp (played by Kurt Russell) who has set to retire from law enforcement duty and settle down in the old town of Tombstone, Arizona where he reunites with his old friend Doc Holliday (played by Val Kilmer) and his brothers: Virgil (played by Sam Elliot), the town marshal, and Morgan (played by Bill Paxton), the town sheriff. Everything in town goes pretty peaceful, that is until a gang of corrupt outlaws lead by the ruthless Curly Bill Brocious (played by Powers Booth) arrive in town and cause tyranny. With the lives of their loved ones threaten, Wyatt and his gang must pick their guns back and serve justice against the unlawful gang.What do you come to expect when hopping aboard the western genre? Bearded men in ten gallon hats? Gunslingers engaging in violent shootouts? Thick Southern accents? As common tropes they are, they all of these happens to be here. But director George P. Cosmotos has much more engaging aspects to offer here than the usual western conventions. Based on an inspiring screenplay by Kevin Jarre partially based on true events, the film boasts a gripping biopic story with mostly solid pacing and charismatic characters, and ventures through the harsh odyssey of former lawmen Wyatt Earp and his call for heroism when the ones he loved become the target of corruption and the life he thought he left behind comes back to grab him by his throat. This all comes down to some bloodshed conflict between his town and the ruthless outlaws of the wild west who threaten to tear him apart. This is not to say the story doesn't offer moments of levity and humor in the midst of its overall solemn atmosphere, particularly from Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday who sprinkles in some comic relief. But the murderous outlaws are not only trouble Wyatt is gutted with, he is also caught in the unexpected love triangle with his narcotic common-law wife Josephine Marcus (played by Dana Delany) and Matty Blaylock (played by Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), which forms to a subplot this story sadly leaves underdeveloped and less dynamic than it should have been. Overall, the story is a spectacle. Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are both genuine and highly rigid in their roles, and the chemistry these leads show is equally moving, though nothing in the Oscar territory, nothing remotely disappointing. Sam Elliot and Bill Paxton are fine, but quite as memorable as the former duo in the performance department, nor is Powers Booth as the gun-slinging antagonist with a thirst of blood.Tombstone is a beautifully engaging western epic with lively performances by Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer, and boasts a powerful, if flawed direction by George G. Cosmatos and a gripping script by Kevin Jarre. Though this film may be not be what I consider a masterpiece, there are plenty of reasons why this film is worth your time, even if the western genre doesn't quite spark your interest.",8,6,9,11 October 2016
Blade Runner," 80s cyberpunk piece sees visionary Ridley Scott taking Phillip K. Dick's inspiring source material and spinning into cinematic mastery
","Ridley Scott's cyberpunk thriller Blade Runner inspired by the short novel by Phillip K. Dick is a film with a reputation that grew following its trouble history with its studio. The debacle started with Scott facing studio interference that lead to re-edits that neither him or lead star Harrison Ford were satisfied with, especially with its dour performance at the box office. The ordeal was followed with re-edits that made their way into the Director's Cut Edition released on home media ten years later. However, it wasn't until Scott polished with the film with a final makeover, renovating the picture to his most satisfying form known as the Final Cut in 2007. What comes of the final product is a stylish futuristic sci-fi piece showing the director operating at arguably his finest fashion. Scorching with a dazzlingly rich visual heft and narrative that breathes a chock load of ambition. It is blistering sci-fi spectacle blooming with elements that have carried influence on many cyberbunk entries in later years including 'Dark City', 'Ghost in The Shell', and 'The Matrix' to name of few. Now that is a definition of a groundbreaking picture. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a local police officer in the futuristic city of Los Angeles in 2019, a city rattled by crime and economic depression. Deckerd is assigned to a daunting task of assassinating four emotionless androids known as Replicants. These otherworldly beings are humanoids who are disguised as regular humans. And the worst part, they happen to be responsible for the theft a spaceship. When he closes in the leader of the group Rachael (played by Seana Young), the only one born with emotion, Deckerd begins to question his identity. In age when science-fiction was the household for mainly aliens, intergalactic warfare, and post-apocalyptic settings; Blade Runner offered something not entirely seminal but highly underpopulated in the genre, and expanded upon it with ideas not many, if any, filmmakers dared to attempt before. This is where the visionary mind of Ridley Scott is poured into with no restraint of ambition. Set in a futuristic society completed with an eye-dazzling visual design that many (especially back in the day of its initial release) could describe as groundbreaking, the film transpires with a plot stitched together with a plethora of twists and turns that leave audiences' head throbbing with questions of Deckard's identity. Is he the man he always believed he is, or is there a secret hidden within his transparent being? As the events unfold into a steadily paced game of cat-and-mouse with sudden bursts of intense gunplay, conspiracy permeates the grim atmosphere to the point where the most intriguing elements lie not within the questions that are answered but the ones that are left unanswered. The story, uprooted marvelously from the script by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, is handled with grace and moves at pace that may prove to be too sluggish for some, but nonetheless allows the for the characters to build and for the plot to bulk up for the cutthroat climax. If you grab a hold of the Final Cut edition, you avoid the unnecessary Harrison Ford narration that bears seemingly no significant purpose. And as for Ford, fresh from his debut in the 'Indiana Jones' franchise', the actor puts on a performance that is more than desirable. There is a fair steam of charisma smoking through his performance. Sean Young remains solid in her role, but nothing that knocks for sheer impression. She just does enough to show she is talented and fitting for the role. Blade Runner is a profoundly engaging cyberpunk piece that broke many grounds for establishing powerful elements that have inspired many entries of the genre today. And the accomplished ambition of Ridley Scott's directorial methodology is what holds the film as one of the most influential sci-fi flicks of its generation. Now that is a fine achievement for a film uprooted from a tortured history.",9,5,11,15 May 2016
Monsters University," Spectacular Monster Inc prequel, Great job Pixar!
","In 2001, Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios pleased millions of movie goers with their animated hit film Monster Inc which told the story of two friends: a blue, furry monster named Sully (voiced by John Goodman) and a green, one-eyed monster named Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal), who worked together for a corporation where monsters creep into bedrooms of little children and scare them to sustain their cities' energy and power resources with the frightened children's screams. Twelve years later, Pixar takes the audience back in time to when Mike and Sully first met during their college days with this prequel to Monster Inc. These two attend college at Monsters University, starting off on each other's not-so-good sides but are forced to work together to compete against the fraternities in the scare games. Joining Oozma Kappa, an unpopular fraternity of social misfits including Scott 'Squishy' Squibbles, middle-aged Don Carlton, Terry Perry and Terri Perry (who are conjoined twins), Art, and Squishy's mother Sherri, Mike and Sully develop a friendships as they compete against the odds of prodigy fraternities, including the prestigious Roar Omega Roar.So this movie plays almost like a cross between college comedies such as Revenge of The Nerds (1984) and Old School (2003) with its subplots involving fraternities and mixes with family-friendly humor, and the result is a cute and clever Pixar film that will without a doubt please the whole family. While it may not feel slightly inferior to Pixar's other works, it still has the style and flair that Disney-Pixar films embrace. Featuring the talented voices of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, Helen Mirren, Peter Sohn, Joel Murray, Sean Hayes, Dave Foley, and Charlie Day, this film boasts an entertaining, if not original, story line of how Mike and Sully became the friends that we knew from the first film. The plot follows on these characters who are kicked out the 'Scare Program' due to their failure being 'scary' and work together by joining a fraternity to make their way back into the program, but face the odds of an expert Roar Omega Roar who find their fun in ridiculing them for their inferiority. There definitely isn't a whole lot of emotionality like Pixar's other films, but that's okay! This film doesn't need it as it has the charm and clever hilarity to make up for it. The animation is pretty solid and the voice acting is fantastic.Monsters University is a pretty decent family movie and this is all thanks to the brilliant work of Pixar. Even if it doesn't live up to Disney-Pixar's usual fare, it is still a film that will make a good choice for children and adults of all ages.",10,0,1,6 October 2015
Casino Royale," Casino Royale is amazing and brings the best of James Bond
","Daniel Craig makes an amazing James Bond debut in this enthralling reboot of the classic spy series. Directed by Martin Campbell who was previously responsible of an earlier Bond film Golden Eye, this follows Secret Agent Bond who is sent by his boss M (played by Judi Dench) to travel to Montenegro to compete against ruthless arms dealer Le Chiffre (played by Mads Mikkelson) in a high-stakes poker game. Along the way, he falls in love with the beautiful Wesper Lynd (played by Eva Green) who assists him providing the money he needs to outwit Chiffre. Before long, it becomes clear that whether Bond wins or not, his life is still in danger when he discovers that Le Chriffe has a sinister plot on his agenda. This movie completely reinvents the iconic spy as a character. Abandoning the heavy high-tech gadgetry from the previous film and relying more on the action and character development, Daniel Craig steps into the James Bond character with energy and vibrancy and brings out one of the most spectacular performances of an action hero ever put on screen. Unlike the previous actors like Pierce Brosnan and Sean Connery, Craig feel so natural as Bond that audience feel that they are not watching his amazing performance, but instead seeing him as the actual James Bond. He just really digs so deep into this character. The plot is falls nothing short of exhilarating and compelling with lavishing suspense and exotic set pieces like Miami and the Bahamas. The story is so brilliantly written from start to finish and even when the pacing slows down at some points, you never feel that there is a single dull moment throughout the film's run. Even the whole poker scene shows great potential at keeping the audience glued to their seats. Much can be said about the action sequences, especially the intense climax at the end. This is all thanks to the amazing cinematography and choreography. Casino Royale sits at one of the high ranks of the James Bond franchise, and is certainly one of Daniel Craig's best roles. This film fires up the James Bond reboot with a bang and brilliantly redefines the titular character as a top-notch action hero.",9,1,6,13 November 2015
Before Sunrise," Very few romantic dramas come as original and moving as this
","As the years pass, filmmakers are running low on ideas for the romance genre faster than some may expect. Many films manage to spit evidence of this, take the film adaptations for Nicholas Sparks' novels for an example (though a few of them are okay). That is not to say the romance genre is dead. Every now and then, Hollywood manages to surprise us with some surprisingly riveting and original love tales such as 'The English Patient', 'Romeo + Juliet', 'There's Something About Mary', and James Cameron ever popular 'Titanic'. But most of time, filmmakers choose to follow down almost same formulaic route: a guy meets a girl, they fall in love, hit some obstacles that put their relationship to the test, and in the end they get back together, a formula that's grown tiresome long before we knew it. This romantic drama directed by Richard Linklater supplies an entirely original love story that completely devoid from the typical romantic clichés that have long plagued the genre. The film opens up with Jesse (played by Ethan Hawke), a young man in his late teens or early 20s on a train to heading back to Vienna (France) where he will be flying back to America at 9:30 the following morning. In escape of a bickering German couple, young woman named Celine (played by Julia Delpy) moves down the aisle where she and Jesse come face-to-face. After engaging in a heart-warming friendly conversation, Jesse convinces her to tour with him around the city of Vienna before he leaves for his flight in the morning which she agrees. Before we know, a heart-touching romance develops between the two in what is their only night together.This love tale takes just about everything we've grown familiar with in romance flicks and pushes them to the sidelines. This is not a story of a man and a woman falling in love in the midst of a sinking boat, a teenage girl finding the hots of a vampire, or a woman developing a relationship with a soldier returning home from war; this follows two college- aged individuals who meet as complete strangers and decide to take the day to know each other before developing a sudden relationship that leads to the night of their lives. Though the film is lacks a cohesive plot is there is very little action other than the characters walking and talking, this film conceives a romantic tale that veers closest to reality than any romance flick has ever before. With most of the film consisting the characters engaging thought-provoking and philosophical conversations about life or revisiting past memories, the film gives audience a long opportunity to immerse with the lead characters and witness the powerful chemistry grow between them. Whether viewers become fascinated by the clever dialogue or the genuine performances by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, there is plenty of magic to experience. Though there are occasional lines that come off rather awkward, particularly when sex becomes the topic. The characters are developed to individuals many can relate to. At certain times, the characters allow us feel their emotions. We experience their anxiety of knowing the next morning they will both be departing separate ways and may never see each other again. Typically, many movies try to the emotional manipulation route by adding syrupy dialogue or overly sentimental music score. Good news! This movie steers away from that.Before Sunrise is a solidly original and riveting romantic tale granted by the graceful talent of Richard Linklater. This is a movie that defies expectations and slams the door on tedious rom-com clichés, very few love stories come as original as this one. However, those expecting a groundbreaking plot are more than likely up for a disappointment. Otherwise, this movie is worth the watch.",8,0,1,21 May 2016
Live Free or Die Hard," Gunfights, explosions, and pure energy by our action hero John McClane
","There is more than likely no other action film franchise that tops the Die Hars franchise. This high-octane made a massive impression on movie goers everywhere when it debuted in 1988 with Bruce Willis spawning the role of John McClane, a hero full of attitude and charisma, and easily recognized as one of the most iconic action heroes in cinema history. Whether he's taking on terrorists at the Nakatomi Plaza building in Los Angeles, at Washington Dulles Airport, and playing a deadly game of Simon Says with one in New York City; McClane never fails to entertain us. This fourth installment sees Bruce Willis reprising his role as McClane once again with Len Wiseman, the man behind the 'Underworld' franchise taking over the director's chair. John McClane, still working for N.Y.P.D., is divorced from his wife Holly and is left estranged by his daughter Lucy (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). When the FBI faces a cyber attack from the hands of an international cyber terrorist Thomas Gabriel (played by Timothy Olyphant) and Lucy is captured and taken hostage by his goons, McClane is called in by the FBI to stop Gabriel and bring him to justice before the he leads the nation into chaos. In the process, McClane finds help from no one other Matt Farell (played by Justin Long), a reluctant young computer hacker who assists him on his off-the-rails mission.After twelve years since the third installment, this fourth entry takes almost everything from the previous entries and cranks them up a notch. Here, the stakes are higher, explosions are more frequent, and the action sequences are much more intense than you may anticipate. The action scenes featuring highway car chases, helicopter crashes, and copious gunfire serve as the most glamorizing beauty of the film, as do the action sequences of the previous installments. What's new here though, is that the action is taken at an absurd level that borders on implausible such as scenes of McClane jolting off an airplane or drifting an 18-wheeler on a highway, but it ultimately doesn't steer it away from the entertainment value, it's still pretty fun. The plot works pretty well too, with the film taking the story and expanding it on a more grand scale where not only a larger population of innocent lives are at threat and of course the White House, but the nation itself. In addition, the pacing is no issue. Bruce Willis remains as likable and charismatic in the role of John McClane as ever. Justin Long does an alright job, but perhaps not as appealing as opposite Bruce Willis. The chemistry between the duo fits well at times, but occasionally feels flat. Timothy Olyphant gives a solid performance as the cyber terrorist Thomas Gabriel. However, he certainly much less memorable than the previous villains spawned in the franchise. The antagonist feels a little underdeveloped and stands easily forgettable by the end. Viewers should not another Hans Gruber-like villain but one that is worth entertainment value while he lasts.Live Free or Die Hard is an exciting, fresh popcorn flick that is destined to please action fans everywhere, and a worthy installment to the Die Hars franchise. This film can easily be stamped as one of the most thrilling action films of the decade, and marks a strong point in Bruce Willis's career. Is it the best Die Hard of the series? Not exactly. But for what it's worth, it's fun.",9,3,5,26 April 2016
Thor: The Dark World," This movie continues the storyline on our titular hero on a fairly blemished note, but at least it is not a total washout
","This sequel to 2011's 'Thor' exhibits the return of our titular Marvel superhero with both the good and the bad to offer for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With no surprise, expectations were high on how this film would handle the resurrection of the hammer- wielding god of thunder considering how the cinematic universe is set speak to the fanbase rather than Hollywood's general expectations. This only bring us to the question of whether it succeeds. The answers lies square in between yes and no. Kenneth Branaugh who directed the first film dropped out of the project, and the director's chair was handed over to Alan Taylor. The final outcome shows the Branaugh holds a slightly more gifted handling on the source material whereas Taylor's rendition of the titular hero leaves more to desired. By no means does this mark a disaster of a sequel but rather a disappointing one to say the least. It has the sleek visual scope that everyone would expect to come from a big- budget MCU entry, but what it has to offer from a narrative standpoint is fairly underwhelming. Chris Hemsworth returns as Thor, the god of thunder who returns to Earth to find his lover Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman) cursed by a mysterious force known as Aether, a sinister weapon helmed from a dark realm. And the evil leader Malekith (played by Christopher Eccleston) is behind all this. When Thor brings Jane to Asgard to learn what's happening to her, his father Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) lacks interest is helping. This leaves Thor with no one to turn to but his dubious brother Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston) in a fight against Malekith and his army of Dark Elves in an effort to free Jane of this sinister curse. Watching Thor battle against the evil demonic forces, thrashing his lightning-charge hammer in an ass-kicking frenzy should be a whole lot of fun. For awhile, it has its moments of excitement, but it is not too long before the excitement steadily starts to drain out beneath the underwhelming storyline. The film does what its predecessor did best, and that is setting up the story with an intriguing premise involving a mythological war raging between Asgard and the evil forces that threaten the mythical realm. Once the the plot kicks into gear, it settles with something less interesting than what is promised. The first half moves along a series of frenetic, visually-arousing action sequences intertwined with overlong exposition used to establish our new main villain Malekith, who is played cleanly by Christopher Eccleston, but nonetheless fails to grow as an interesting figure. Whereas Tom Hiddleston's Loki flourished with charisma that made him a compelling villain, Malekith lacks depth and feels awfully generic which only renders it final climatic sequence less effective; though not without plenty of sweet special effects to go around. As for Chris Hemsworth, he remains charismatic ever as ever in the title role as does Tom Hiddleston as his brother Loki who's alignment on both the good side and the bad side stands ambiguous. Meanwhile, Natalie Portman is restrained in the damsel-in-distress role that operates more as a plot device than a solid character. Many will be wishing she and Hemsworth demonstrated a much stronger chemistry.Thor: Dark World marks a fairly inferior chapter to the now- franchise, and ends on a rather disappointing note. However, it is not to say that Alan Taylor doesn't offer the goods in terms of special effects action elan to occupy those who are able to skim past the patchy flaws in its script. Compared to other entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this makes for a lesser option, but maybe one worth at least a try for better or worse. After all, the movie is not a total washout",6,1,1,4 November 2017
Lucy," Great idea, poorly executed
","In this mind-bending thriller boasting glamorizing visual effects and stylized action choreography, Scarlett Johanson steps outside her role Marvel superhero Black Widow and plays Lucy, a young woman who caught between a dangerous drug exchange in Taiwan by a French police captain Pierre Del Rio (played by Amr Waked). When she is taken hostage by Rio and his goons, they inject her with the mysterious drug that gives her mind-blowing psychological abilities that allow to use her full brain capacity. This, she is able to perform these incredible human abilities such as mentally time travel and not feeling pain or discomfort. Morgan Freeman plays Professor Norman, a college psychology teacher who assists Lucy on her escape from Rio and his evil gang.The movie boasts a pretty interesting premise, but its sadly executed with an incoherent plot and a storyline that, before too long, makes a less and less sense as it progresses. This movie tries to impress us with its flashy visual effects. The visual effects are quite intriguing, and sadly that is the only eye-candy you get. Scarlett Johanson shows off a decent performance as the main heroine, but it is not enough to save this movie. The concept of how the main character gains these mental abilities is interesting. The problem is the movie doesn't do anything exciting with it. Worse, it veers into the territory of predictable. Each scene featuring the titular character facing off against enemies, she's empowered with psychic abilities that render her unstoppable, and therefore results in action scenes that are tension less and fall short of depth. There is very little excitement and barely any thrills that by the end, it just stops becoming interesting. I have to say I was pretty let down by this movie. Lucy is a film that had so much going for it but was left watered down by botched execution. Unless you a die-hard Scarlett Johanson fan, it is worth looking elsewhere because you are not likely to awarded with the same charisma she has established in her previous roles.",3,0,5,6 August 2015
Moonrise Kingdom," Wes Anderson's quirky coming-of-age adventure is whimsical, delightful, and blisters with eccentric charm
","One thing viewers can walk away with when sitting through Moonrise Kingdom is that Wes Anderson has a gift for storytelling and style without resorting to conventionality. This coming-of-age adventure blending in both comedy and drama is a whimsical journey Anderson's signature style with a brimming sense of substance many, if not all, teens and adults can come to admire. Of course, Anderson does not take a leap deep into reality. Instead, it presents a roster of eccentric characters and quirky situations to tell a story of two children who vow to escape their domestic home lives where they are misunderstood pawns of families who intentionally (and unintentionally) torment their everyday lives. As this is a Wes Anderson picture though, it breathes plenty of idiosyncratic humor in the air that allows viewers to connect with the story while engaging in Anderson's unique style of smarts, humor, and unconventional narrative norms. The film, set in the 1960s New England, follows Sam Shakusky (played by Jared Gillman), a 12- year old boy attending a boys scout under the wing of Scoutmaster Randy Ward (played by Edward Norton) while forced to deal with the torment of his mean-spirited scoutmates; and Suzy Bishop (played by Kara Hayward), a quiet girl of the same age living with her parents (played by Frances McDormand and Bill Murray) and her little brothers who she despises. Determined to escape their home lives, the two venture out into the woods and where they begin to bond and eventually form a romantic relationship. Their absence soon alert the both the boys scout and Suzy's family as they set out along with the town's police Captain Sharp (played by Bruce Willis) to look for them, turning the town into a wild topsy-turvy. The movie has all of the right feel of a Wes Anderson, from the flat space camera movement, to the limited color palette, to the quirky dialogue. And for the most important part, it works as an eccentric piece of comedic fare. Anderson delivers the goods with his signature quirky dark humor and unconventional characters that feel like more than just two-dimensional figures dwindling beneath his signature methodology. The central core of the story is two preteen children who form a seemingly inseparable bond through their opening in each other's broken lives. Sam is a lonely boy who's parents are dead and is forced to deal with the maltreatment of his fellow peers, while Suzy is a cynical young girl who can't seem to find the love of her family. As the two fall in love, there a subtle chemistry is developed in not meant to convey a sense of charm, but a symbol of freedom. While the sensuality between the two may leave some conservative viewers in slight discomfort, especially when observing them dancing in their underwear, it is the maturity that triumphs over edginess. And kudos to go to both Jared Gillman and Kara Hayward for their mature performances. When the story periodically shifts its focus on the families and the authorities out in search for them, everything remains just as tasteful, but with a quirkier edge. There, we witness a plethora of screwball performances by Edward Norton, Wes Anderson veteran Bill Murray, and the unusually eccentric Bruce Willis in roles that more often than not resemble caricatures. Of course, Anderson is known for his cartoony style, and that is what his films bravely unique. And while they are certainly not the kind of performances that will leave people talking for a while, they deserve to be admired. Moonrise Kingdom marks a delightful cinematic achievement by Wes Anderson who opens the gates to a whimsical, elegant adventure of freedom and coming to terms with a disillusioned home life. Although I can say it necessarily strikes cinematic gold, which would be saying a lot otherwise, it is a film that a substance and heart that demands to be observed.",8,0,0,23 September 2017
The Sixth Sense," M. Night Shyalaman's supernatural horror venture makes for a thought-provoking and spine-chilling experience
","The Sixth Sense is not your average paranormal horror thriller, it is a thought-provoking with a strong emotional edge associated with its spine-chilling scares. The ingenious mastermind this supernatural horror-fest is M. Night Shyalaman who pours a heart and soul into the core of its chilling story. In an age where many filmmakers strive for both successful and unsuccessful attempts at scare with with drenching their films in an enormous barrage of blood and gore and jump scares, Shyalaman sheds away from these conventions by showcasing a story that spends chills down your spine, while grabbing at your heart with an emotional atmosphere many films of the genre are often not accustomed to. So here's the question, what if you had the ability to see spirits of the deceased? The answers lie within the grounded core of this supernatural thriller carried on the shoulders of young Haley Joel Osment as it follows a little boy lost in a world of unspeakable imaginations. There are rules, however, that must be established when bringing an eerie world of the dead beyond the grave to life. That's a generous method the Indian-born filmmaker applies to pulling audiences into an emotional jarring experience where paranoia is rampant and the lines between reality and fantasy are blurred. The film, set in Shyalaman's hometown in Philadelphia, follows Malcolm Crowe (played by Bruce Willis), a once-gifted child psychologist who is set up with an emotionally disturbed nine-year old boy named Cole Sears (played by Haley Joel Osment), a lonely boy living his misunderstood mother (played by Toni Collette). Upon meeting the young lad, it becomes clear that the boy needs help. But things become complicated when Malcolm discovers that Cole has a mysterious ability to communicate with the ghost of dead people.It it rare for a horror film to carry such a significant amount of intellect and heart as this film, unless you look at the age of the Stephen King-based horror entities that made a crucial impact in the genre during the 80s and 90s. M. Night Shyalaman brings his directorial talent to the table, and the beauty of his filmmaking style shines in more ways than one. For the scenes that are so supposed to be scary, the film gets scary. For the scenes that are supposed to touch your heart, the film grabs at your heart, and not in a way that feels contrived. Shyalaman keeps the story moving at a reasonable pace as it builds up on Cole's exploration of the real world clashing with the world of the deceased, while accompanying the atmosphere with twists and turns not many people will see coming. Rarely does he let any moment go wasted. At every step of the way, there is a sheer amount of suspense roaring in each scene as Cole is visited by deceased individual who pop out of nowhere and began haunting his presence. Pay attention to when the temperature drops and Cole's breath gets cold. And while the score by James Newton Howard is beautiful to listen to, it is the heartfelt performance by Haley Joel Osment that challenges our emotions. For a ten-year-old boy, this actor knows how to tap into the heart string with a performance that pounds with strong emotional magnitude, especially in a scene with his mother towards the end. Working along his side is Bruce Willis, a German-born famous for his adrenaline-fueled role as John McClane in the 'Die Hard' series, who expands upon his acting chops to deliver a performance that is simply riveting. The Sixth Sense is a thoughtful, spine-chilling supernatural thrillers that marks a landmark achievement on the horror genre thanks to the rewarding directorial efforts by M. Night Shyalaman. For the phase 'you will not many horror movies like this one', this quote definitely applies to this cinematic bolt. The movie is not all about scares, it is also about heart and redemption",10,0,2,23 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Satisfying attempt on continuing the Star Wars saga
","It has been ten years since the last entry of arguably the most popular science-fiction film series of all time. J.J Abrams who brought an amazing vision with stellar special effects and visuals to the screen with his hit films such as Mission Impossible III (2006), Star Trek (2009), Super 8 (2011), and Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013). This year, Abrams brings his incredible vision to the long-waited sequel that would continue the epic saga of the Star Wars Universe. Set thirty years after the events of 'Return of The Jedi', when Luke Skywalker brought down the Galactic Empire, a new threat known as the First Order lead by the evil leader Snoke (played by Andy Serkis) and his ally Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) arises, along with the Resistance in attempt to capture Luke Skywalker who has gone missing, and his whereabouts are unknown. A young stormtrooper named FN-2187 a.k.a Finn (played by John Boyega) escapes from the galaxy with pilot Poe Dameron (played by Oscar Isaac) to search for mini droid named BB-8, who has the map to Luke Skywalker's location. When the mission goes wrong, and Poe and Finn are separated, Finn meets a scavenger named Rey (played by Daisy Ridley). Assisted by Hans Solo (played by Harrison Ford) and his furry friend Chewbacca, Finn and Kylo must fight against the First Order and save the galaxy once and for all. After all the massive hype beginning from the release of the trailer, I knew that this film was one not worth missing. I noticed the absence of Luke Skywalker in the trailers which quite concerned as he is supposed to be a play a key role in whole plot. Upon walking out of the theater, it it safe to say I was satisfied, but there is no ignoring that the film does face a few flaws along the way. With the film introducing new characters to the franchise, it is important for the characters to be well-developed. John Boyega's character Finn is an interesting character and serves decently as the main hero. Boyega himself gives an alright performance, although his acting does slip in some scenes. Then there is Emily Ridley's character Rey who is another interesting character. The biggest flaw with her character however, is that we don't learn very much about her in terms of origins, and the nothing in the story seems to hint of it. The rest of the new characters such as the villains Snoke and Kylo Ren make compelling villains, even if they are not as memorable as Darth Vader. Later on, we are treated with some familiar faces such as C-3PO, R2-D2, and Princess Leia. As the story follows events took place in sixth episode of the series, it fortunately treats the us with a great premise, and the plot does work; at least for half of the time. However, there is no doubt that the story is a bit disappointing at times, especially considering the compelling the stories these previous films. Nearly scene after the other is easy to predict, particular for those who are avid Star Wars fans. There are few scenes that will undeniably tick many fans off, one in particular that left many (including me) in my theater letting out a loud and collective groan. There are also a few hiccups in terms of pacing here and there. Overall, the story was entertaining enough, at least in my opinion. The climatic light saber battle towards the end is one of the best scenes throughout the film, and kept me glued to my seat.Stars War: The Force Awakens is a satisfying attempt on continuing the saga of this beloved franchise, and is destined to only garner over a billion dollars at the box office, but very likely break the worldwide box office record, currently held by James Cameron's 'Avatar'. It is critically important for viewers to be familiar with (at least) the first trilogy in order to understand storyline a little better. Star Wars fan are likely to be hit with some disappointment with this installment, even if they enjoy some of its small pleasures like the enticing visual effects. However, this film is not worth missing and it definitely deserves a try from every Star Wars fanatic out there. In other words, may the force be with you!",7,2,16,18 December 2015
Unbroken," An amazing story, great characters, but very slow paced
","Most people know Angelina Jolie playing in action movies. However, she takes the directorial path in this drama set in World War II. Jack O'Connell plays an Olympic track runner, who joins the army during WW2 in the pacific theater. When his crew face a tragic plane crash, him and his remaining crew members are stranded on life rafts, only to get picked up by the Japanese and sent to a prison camp. This movie was entertaining at times, but I felt it could have been done better. It was very slow at times, to the point where I began to lose interest. However, the plot was so beautifully written that I could not take my eyes off the screen (until the end). On the positive side, the characters were quite amazing too. Jack O'Connell did a great job as the main character. I personally think I could have landed in Oscar. It was very upsetting to watch the character struggle through the Japanese soldiers' maltreatment. However, the settings were quite authentic and the way the soldiers smacked and brutally beat down the prisoners gave the film a sense of emotional realism. Maybe this film would have been better if it was directed by Steven Spielberg or Clint Eastwood. All in all, the film wasn't bad and it is probably watching. However, I would not recommend this to children under 14 because it does pretty intense at times.",6,11,14,28 March 2015
Final Destination," An intriguing teen horror-thriller
","James Wong, director of the hit television series 'X-Files', steps inside the teen-horror genre with this intriguing disaster-thriller. Alex Browning (played by Devon Sawa), a high school senior is on his way on a week-long field trip with his French class to Paris. Shortly upon boarding the plane, Alex has a horrifying vision of the plane exploding. Plagued with paranoia, Alex panics and rushes off the plane, with seven others removed off board. Much to everyone's shock, Alex's nightmare comes true when the plane unexpectedly explodes upon takeoff, killing everyone on board. The survivors off board include Alex's best friend Todd (Chad E. Donella), his arch-rival Carter (Kerr Smith), Carter's girlfriend Terri (Amanda Detmer), orphaned girl Clear (Ali Larter), tag-along student Billy (Seann William Scott), and their teacher Mrs. Lewton (Kristen Cloke). While many become grief- stricken by their losses, Alex discovers that death is still after them when the survivors who originally escaped their demise begin dying in freak accidents.Final Destination was definitely one of the most original horror films Hollywood has it offer. This isn't a typical horror movie. Instead of a blade-wielding killer in a mask, girls possessed by evil spirits, or people being attacked by monstrous creatures; this film deals with the killer being death itself. The concept involves teenagers who escape a deadly plane explosion and begin dying in really unusual accidents. Basically, these characters get killed from doing average, everyday stuff like cooking or hanging clothes. Yes, this may sound somewhat laughable, but this film does a good job making this suspenseful and intense. The plane crash sequence was pretty intense for me, it almost had me scared of going another plane ride. The death scenes were also pretty intense, although I think they could have been done better. I really love the characters in this movie. Each one of the characters are very well developed and have their own personality. Alex, the main character was easily my favorite, along with Ali Larter's character Clear, the girl who stands by Alex's side after the plane disaster; unlike the other characters who blame Alex for the deaths of the people on the plane. The cast did an alright job as their characters, none of them really stand out from others.",8,1,2,11 July 2015
The Purge," Amazing dystopian idea doesn't quite live up to its fullest
","It is common for filmmakers to conceive such fascinating ideas and watch as they're ideas translate poorly on-screen. On the bright side, some of these instances have to be proved to be surprisingly successful, most particularly films dealing with a dystopian society. This film directed and written by James DeMonoco establishes a profoundly interesting concept that raises questions about our society today, including 'Could this possibly happen in the future?' and 'Would this be beneficial, damaging to our society, or both?'. This film is set in the near future in which the government has enacted a legislation known as The Purge, an annual night of the year when crime in America including murder, rape, and robbery is legal for twelve hours without any interference or disciplinary response by the law enforcement. The purpose of this act is reduce our country's crime rate and unemployment which reaches an all-time low thanks to this act. The plot centers on the Sandin family including James (played by Ethan Hawke), Mary (played by Lena Headey), and their two teenage children Charlie (played by Max Burkholder) and Zoey (played by Adelaide Kane); a family who lives in a beautiful home set with a high-tech security system which they use to protect themselves on the night of the Purge. When a lonely man batter in blood wanders the streets yelling for help from a gang of masked criminals lead by the sadistic leader (played by Rhys Wakefield) out to kill him, Charlie unlocks the security system letting the poor man. With the gang breaking into their house demanding for the man they are targeting. The family must stand together to survive the violent while struggling to turn into the killers that are after them.With such as thought-provoking idea like this brought together on-screen, it's difficult not to think of the possibilities like 'What would you do during the Purge?' while watching this. The film succeeds on some levels such as formulating stark, thought-provoking themes and generating some well drawn characters, particularly the main characters James and Mary who are awarded with fine performances by Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey. The script on the other hand, lies the film's biggest falter. The plot is not bad and does enough to keep at least some glued to their seats, it never quite reaches its full potential. There are so many grounds the plot leaves unexplored and because of this, results in an brilliant film concept that feels somewhat unfinished. Instead of venturing through various concepts, the plot focuses primarily on the family's fight for survival and the grim atmosphere that drives the plot. The suspense works at times, but at other times feels dull. The main conflict here is not the family confrontation against the sadistic criminals that threaten to kill them but also the inner conflict within the characters, the testing of their moral compass when they stuck with decision to either throw the poor man the son let in out to die, or pick up their weapons to fight to protect him and themselves. In the end, viewers eventually come to care for the characters and hope of their survival, even the film fails to be scary or inventive as it outta be. Overall, The Purge is an okay film that expresses some intriguing concepts and thrills, although some viewers will left yearning for more. The film may suffer some flaws in terms of writing and direction but there is still some good to be handed here. Those looking for a straight-out scare fest are likely to be displeased, others may find some satisfaction here.",6,0,0,9 June 2016
Munich," One of Steven Spielberg's best
","Many historical events around the world deserve a good adaption to the silver screen. This film does a magnificent job on portraying the 1972 Munich massacre while following up a fictional account of protagonists on their efforts to retaliate. The plot focuses on an Israeli man played Eric Bana who's assigned to set out to Germany and hunt down the eleven individuals who're responsible for the assassinations of eleven Israeli athletes, prior the Munich Olympics. The plot was very well written and the characters were brilliantly constructed. The acting was best aspect of the film, Eric Bana should have one an Oscar for his performance. He pulls off his character in a realistic way and it made the film more believable. During the assassination scenes, there is so much suspense that they would have you biting your nails.Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite directors of all time, his movies are always satisfying experiences and this is no exception. Munich is definitely worth a try.",9,1,1,2 November 2014
Pitch Perfect," Funny, clever, and a joy to watch
","Pitch Perfect is one of the best comedy film I've seen in recent years. Not only was it funny but it was also very clever and the actresses performances were quite good. Anna Kendrick was definitely the best out of all of them. I loved the way she performed as the main character. Her best scene was singing her hit song 'Cups'. Fat Amy, on the other hand, was the funniest of all. She manages to deliver some of the funniest one liners ever.The movie is very similar to the television show Glee, mainly because of its charm and its plot centered on singing. The singing and dancing were very decent but the best scene I would say would be the scene when the girls are trying out during the auditions. This is the scene that made me laugh the most. The scene with the girl vomiting profusely in the midst of the girls arguing was also pretty funny as well.I recommend this movie everyone, especially teens.",9,0,2,17 December 2014
The Truman Show," One of the most original comedies Hollywood has to offer
","Have you ever had the suspicious feeling you were being watched or followed by someone? This fear plays a primal in this funny and thought-provoking science-fiction comedy-drama set in an alternate reality, that tackles on the culture of celebrities. Directed by Peter Weir, This film stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a white- collar worker living an average life with this wife Meryl Burbank (played by Laura Linney), but dreams of becoming an explorer and taking his wife on a vacation to Fiji. Soon, Truman begins to encounter some strange events including visions of his father Kirk Burbank (played by Brian Delate) who was lost at sea during a violent storm when he was a child, and suspicious behavior by local residents around him. Truman eventually comes to realize that his world is not what it seems as he is unaware that his life is 24-hour reality television show created by television producer Christof (played by Ed Harris) with an audience of millions of people around the world. Truman sets out on a quest to learn the truth of his life.Not many movies come as original nor inventive as this one. This film sparks an exceptionally intelligent idea and brings it to life with some mesmerizing performances, ingenious writing, and themes that electrify deep imagination. Unlike in his usual comedic work like 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Ace Ventura', Jim Carrey breaks away from his goofy screwball typecasting and takes on a slightly more dramatic in this thought-provoking drama, while managing to squeeze out some laughs here and there. He is very energetic in his role and gives one of the most refined performances of his career. He's always funny during the right moments and always sincere during the more serious moments; and his character is someone you can't help but love. Laura Linney who plays his wife is also very charming in her role, and her chemistry with Jim Carrey works well. But the biggest gem comes from Ed Harris's portrayal as Christof, the television producer behind the long-running reality show that is the main character's life. He is a very interesting character and diligently written, a character who conveys a God-like resemblance as he is the creator of Truman's life. So yeah, there is a small religious theme in the story and it works very good.Director Peter Weir and writer Andrew Niccol bring quite a vision to this movie. They take quite an innovative idea and do many clever things with it. The movie takes an interesting direction and tackles many thought-filled themes including metaphilosophy, simulated reality, and existentialism. These are best demonstrated as the titular character experiences strange occurrences around him and tries to make sense of them unaware of the shocking revelation about his life. When he suspects the world changing him, he begins the test his boundaries, one scene for example where he tries to drive off a bridge. Then there are some scenes cutting to some recurring characters sitting in front of their television watching as Truman is subconsciously broadcasted via hidden cameras. This idea leads to commentary of the culture of celebrities and media officials' effort on exposing details on the private lives of individuals. The entire concept is of the film is very thought-provoking and powerful enough to leave viewers with a paranoid feeling, but at the same time pokes fun at itself with some laughter and clever characters.The Truman Show is truly a remarkable film sparkled with such an original idea and an incredible script. This is definitely that will appeal to many Jim Carrey fans including adults and maybe pre-teens. Viewers should not go into this movie expecting a straight laugh- out-loud comedy like most of Jim Carrey's films, there are some dramatic and emotional moments from time to time. Overall, this movie is something worth watching.",9,0,0,27 February 2016
The Matrix," Innovative and exhilarating in both an epic and visual scale, The Matrix is a groundbreaking thrill ride
","What if our world is just an illusion and our reality lies inside high-tech computer system? This thought-provoking and reasonably complicated concept is the premise in this exhilarating sci-fi action thriller directed by The Wachowksis who debuted in their career with the neo-noir thriller 'Bound' in 1996. Breaking numerous grounds of both the science-fiction and action genre, this cyberpunk thriller sees the duo filmmaking team operating on a solid balance of complex, innovative storytelling and groundbreaking visual effects that no one before the late 1990s had seen before. The Wachowskis bravely accomplish this feat by introducing a highly cerebral concept that not only strikes the human pulse but feels entirely original, tackling on themes of philosophy, religion, and gripping social commentary of how technology plays a vital role in our society. With almost two decades past, this film has established many elements that have become highly influential to the science-fiction genre today. This film follows Thomas 'Neo' Anderson (played by Keanu Reeves), a software engineer during the day and computer hacker by night who finds himself chased by a sentient Agent Smith (played by Hugo Weaving) who are set to kill him. He crosses paths with a black suit agent named Morpheus (played by Laurence Fishburne), he learns that all of mankind is a simulated reality known as the Matrix, operated by cyber intelligence, and the real world lies in a futuristic universe where lives are operated by a series of computer systems. When an army of malware machines begin taking over the Matrix. Neo must join forces with Morpheus and fellow computer hacker Trinity (played by Carrie-Anne Moss) to lead a rebellion against these entities lead by Agent Smith who's causing it.Although the plot is not an easy one to follow, it does almost nothing to takeaway from the absorbing beauty of both The Wachowskis' thoughtful direction and mind-bending script which energized the story in a shiny, cerebral fashion. In further words, the Wachowskis intend not to plunge you into a psychological mind-rape of convoluted storytelling but to stroll you through cutting-edge journey of discovery. Paying homages to classic stories such as Lewis Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland' while revitalizing the innovative dystopian genre, this film operates with tour-de-force storytelling that takes viewers on a pulse-pounding, frenetically paced adventure through a mind-bending world of simulated reality and psychological deception. And the plot unfolds in a complex balance of exhilarating action sequences including the newly introduced bullet-time slow motion sequences, and a cerebral narrative that tackles on philosophical and religious themes. The action consists a blend of martial arts action and frenetic shootout sequences complete with eye-feasting visual effects and slow-motion editing. Arguably the most pulse-pounding action sequences comes during a hyperkinetic lobby shootout scene. The scenes are all shot with innovative cinematography. As for the narrative which is also written by the Wachowskis, the plot follows the lead character Neo as he must learn the truth behind the fake reality he's been living all his life and fight against the evil forces who carry convoluted plans turning the real world he thought as a parallel universe into a world of hell. What transpires is not only a mind-bending journey through a series of hyperkinetic action set pieces and sassy, cyberpunk imagery, but also the lead character who's reveal to be a God-like figure who's chosen as the savior of humanity in a plot intended to pay homage to a biblical epic (with Alice in Wonderland slapped into the mix). And with strong efforts, the Wachowskis take just enough time to flesh out most of the characters.Following the decline of Will Smith, the Wachowskis were able set their eyes on a charismatic actor who happened to be no one other Keanu Reeves. Cashing in on the lead role, Keanu Reeves delivers an incredible portrayal as the reluctant action hero Thomas 'Neo' Anderson who evolves from a struggling white-collar worker into a biblical-like hero with a highly train set of skills in both hand-to-hand and armed combat. Thus, he is granted an opportunity to demonstrate his adrenaline action testosterone in a series of frenetic action set pieces. Alongside, he also demonstrates an engaging camaraderie with Laurence Fishburne who gives a riveting portrayal as Morpheus, the man who takes Neo under his wing into the imaginative alternate reality that Neo was never aware of. Fighting along their side in battle is Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity who shows her incredible badass persona in which we are greatly introduced during the action-heavy scenes. Then there is the main villain Agent Smith behind the evil scheme, and he is played by Hugo Weaving who delivers a stern, heart-stopping portrayal as the devious man suited in a tuxedo and shades. In shorts, Weaving pulls no punches when letting out in the dubious attitude in his character. The rest of cast is consists of Joe Pantoliano, Gloria Foster, Marcus Chong along with many others who left cashing in on smaller-sized roles but nonetheless play fair roles in the plot.The Matrix is an exhilarating science-fiction action piece that stands strong on both an epic and visual scale, and sets home to some of the most influential elements of the sci-fi genre today. In outstanding efforts, it is an explosively entertaining sci-fi flick with the driving force of the Wachowskis who spring the film to life. The film is a pulse-pounding and equally complex tale that is more fun to enjoy without beating your brain to a pulp trying to follow the complicated plot, at least for the first viewing.",9,0,1,7 February 2017
Looper," Looper is very intelligent, superbly original, and boasts a thoughtful portrayal on time travel
","Over the past several decades, time travel has proved to be a tough subgenre to tackle to the science-fiction realm. When putting elements of time travel into the mix, some directors to this day struggle to effectively formulate a a compelling narrative heft without turning their plots into unnecessarily convoluted messes through the use of time travel as a backdrop. That is certainly not to say there are some films that achieved this feat in the past like 'Terminator' for example. Rian Johnson on the other hand, offer a smart, thoughtful, and arguably one of the most original portrayals of time travel ever put to the screen; and it all comes together in a shiny execution in this neo-noir sci-fi thriller. The film is set in the distant future of 2044 when time travel has finally been manufactured, but also made illegal to where it can only be performed secretively. Joseph-Gordon Levitt plays Joe, an expert contract killer what people refer to as a 'Looper' who spends his days executing criminals as they appear face-concealed in a field through the use of time travel by crime syndicates, and disposes of their bodies. Somewhere along the way, Joe comes face-to-face with an old man (played by Bruce Willis) from the future who happens to be an older version of him, and his on his way to pursue a mysterious figure known as the 'Rainmaker' responsible for the death of his wife in the future. Hiding out an old farmhouse owned by a young woman named Sara (played by Emily Blunt), Joe must protect her telekinetic 5-year old Cid (played by Pierce Gagnon) from being killed by the older Joe who believes he is the future Rainmaker.This neo-noir science-fiction piece could have easily another one of your average action-packed shoot-em-up a wide plethora of car chases and explosions (which could work if done with plenty of substance), but director Rian Johnson has something more captivating in mind and it all results in a highly indigenous execution of plot following a man vs. man conflict. Time travel plays a central role in the plot as it sprawls on the lead character's journey to confront an elderly version of himself who places him on a blood-stained timeline, and the plot unfolds in a complex and thoroughly unpredictable series of twists and turns as Joseph-Gordon Levitt's Joe fights for answers behind his older self's sinister motives including the explanation behind the telekinetic powers acquired by Emily Blunt's young son which never the plot never quite dives into firmly. But thankfully, the plot offers plenty of tension from the two main leads meeting face-to-face for the first time, to the occasional sudden shootout sequences, to the startling climax leads to a plot revelation, with the inconsistency in the pacing serving as a moderate frustration for some. Lastly, the cast manages to satisfy in the performance department with Joseph-Gordon Levitt and Bruce Willis both delivering a sincere portrayal as their characters clash, though the prosthetic nose used on Levitt to veer a passable resemblance of Willis can be somewhat distracting. Emily Blunt as the likable actress she is, also comes off committed and humane in her role along with Pierce Gagnon as her mysterious son.Looper is an intelligent, thoughtful science-fiction thriller that breathes life into a superbly original idea with the hands of Rian Johnson working behind the camera. For many sci-fi fans looking for something original, this one doesn't just deliver it packs quite a punch. All in all, it is easily one of the most recent and profound examples of original ideas brought to life.",8,0,1,2 November 2016
Deadpool," Funny, violent, and irreverent superhero action comedy that demands for your attention
","Superhero films based on Marvel comics (as well as DC comics) are often subject for the most anticipated films of their years, and usually come out with impressively rich box office receipts, even when they fail to make a lasting impression. This film, operated by first-time director Tim Miller, is a unique turn for the comic-book genre. The centric figure of this superhero action comedy is the crude, merc-of-the- mouth anti-hero everyone knows as Deadpool. The irreverent, foul-mouthed hero, wielding his blades and firearms like John McClane on crack, splashes into the screen with an audacious approach very few comic books have gone before. He is not your average Marvel Comics hero for those who have grown accustomed to typical figures like Spiderman, Thor, and Captain America. He is a wise-cracking guy with a patent of breaking the fourth wall, cracking down on raunchy one-liners, and dispatching his enemies in a violent, gory fashion that superbly hence the R-rating. And it is up to Ryan Reynolds to bring his charismatic hero to life that not only remains faithful to the popular source material, but serves justice to title character's lifeless appearance in 'X-Men Origins'. This film follows Wade Wilson (played by Ryan Reynolds), a hard- headed New York City mercenary who falls in love with Vanessa (played by Morena Baccarin), the girl of his dreams. As these two fall into an adorable relationship, Wade soon finds his life in danger when he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. The only one is capable of helping him fight this disease is an artificially mutated scientist Dr. Francis Freeman a.k.a. Ajax (played by Ed Skrein) who subjects him to an experiment that quickly goes awry and turns into a red, sickish-looking monster. To matters worse, he kidnaps Vanessa. So it is up to Wade to save her. Suiting up in red wetsuit, an arsenal of firearms and ammunition, and adopts his egotistical identity Deadpool, he teams up with X-Men hero Collossus (voiced by Stefan Kapicic) and his teenage trainee Negasonic Teenager Warhead (played by Brianna Hildebrand) to save her.Following the origin story of the loud-mouth hero, director Tim Hill wastes no potential when portraying the irreverent nature of the eponymous character, nor does Ryan Reynolds on capturing the crude, over-the-top personality that makes him such an charismatic, yet raunchy figure. The film finds an even balance of gut-busting hilarity and pulse-pounding actions sequences to meet a satisfying showcase of the merc-of-the-mouth hero, and that the elements of both the film and the character himself acknowledging his comedic resonance. This is best demonstrated in the opening credits which is generates to some laughter for its creativity. But when our hero comes face-to-face with against the baddies, that is when the real fun begins as our hero cracks down on some hilarious one-liners that strong at hitting the funny bone. However, if you have read the comics, you know that is the not the same kind of fun you would expect in more family-friendly entries like 'The Avengers' or 'Captain America', there are plenty of crude jokes, four-letter words, and more than enough blood and gore to justify its R-rating. So parents, if you plan on taking your children to this, you are in for a rude awakening. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining ride thanks to Ryan Reynolds who shines like gold in the role, spewing one laugh after another with his striking comedic indulgence as does T.J Miller as the comic relief character. Ed Skrein makes a good impression as the main villain. But let's get real, it is Reynolds who is takes the show, especially in the scenes of him breaking the fourth wall and being a wise-ass. Deadpool is a violet, crass, yet wildly entertaining superhero action comedy that desperately demands for the attentions of all comic books fans, and most of everyone else. It is a big thrill ride that marks an impressive achievement for director Tim Miller. And as it is worth mentioning, make sure to stay for the post-credits scene if you are interested in a moment of both laughter and nostalgia. Well, at least for some.",9,3,12,19 February 2016
Cloud Atlas," Exhilarating and innovative on a cerebral level, Cloud Atlas is a compelling, albeit deeply unwieldy science-fiction epic placed into splendid effect
","The Wachowski team collaborate with writer Tom Tykwer to spin English writer David Mitchell's highly complex novel of the same name into cinematic poetry. Scorching with uncompromising ambition and electrifying visual methodology, Cloud Atlas is an enormous roar of a cinematic project that is bound to divide people. David Mitchell's novel is written in a profoundly unwieldy style, making a daring attempt at balancing six interrelated storylines, that many described as 'unfilmable'. For the Wachowskis and co-writer Tom Tykwer (who also serves as co-director), unfilmable is not in their books. Their rendition of the seemingly undoable novel is a blooming science-fiction tale with relentless complexity, challenging philosophy, and an outlandish narrative structure that will lead people into coming out with high praise or extreme loathing, with a significantly small minority straying between the middle. To me, this star-studded film roars as a splendid cinematic achievement with glaring flaws that are not too hard to notice but are nonetheless overshadowed by the filmmakers' enchanting style, even if their ambition towers over the film's grasp. Telling as story spanning across six different periods within human history, this film opens up in 1849 in the Pacific Islands where American Lawyer Adam Ewing (played by Jim Sturgess) becomes a stow away on ship carrying a poor African-American man to slavery before challenging to crew in a battle of wills. Jump to 1936 Cambridge, England, we meet Robert Frobisher (played by Ben Whishaw), an English composer who collaborates with an elderly composer (played by Jim Broadbent) who has a dubious agenda hidden under his sleeve. Next, we are taken to 1973 San Francisco, where journalist Luisa Rey (played by Halle Berry) is trapped in an elevator, only to nuclear scientist (played by James D'Arcy) who informs him a diabolical plot to take down a nuclear reactor. This places her on the path of a violent assassin Bill Smoke (played by Hugo Weaving) who tries to outwit her plans. Next up, we come to 2012 London, England where elderly man Timothy Cavendish (also played by Jim Broadbent) who finds himself in the ruts of a retirement home he is wrongly enrolled in. Now jumping ahead to the future, we meet Sonmi-451 (played by Doona Bae) in 2144 Seoul, South Korea where she is subject to slavery at a futuristic fast-food restaurant run by her clones before crossing paths with Yoona-939 (played by Zhao Xun) to rebel against the corrupt system. Finally, we make to 2321 where tribesman Zachary (played by Tom Hanks) and his family are living in a post-apocalyptic society where technology no longer exist. Zachary cross paths with a mysterious woman (also played by Halle Berry) who has connections to the technologically advanced past.Yes, describing the plot is nothing short of a mouthful. And many will asking what to do these six storylines have in common. The answers are slowly, but subtly unveiled throughout the film, which clocks just merely under three hours. While many will doubt that the runtime isn't inflated, many would be surprised to believe that this runtime might even be enough to fully flesh out of the storylines that take place, especially when viewers are giving the absurdly difficult task of trying to decipher the connection between each storyline. It is a powerfully complex narrative scope that strictly demands your attention in order to keep track of where the film is going on, something that most people may not be able to accomplish upon first viewing. Each storyline is sketched with a unique sense of humanity and melancholy that sheds the light on both the beauty and the darkness of humankind, while paying an absorbing message to how a single choice from the past and change a major course of society in the future. Some storylines are more compelling than others in terms of emotional twists and soundness. The story set in 1936 Cambridge with Ben Whishaw working as a composer for an aging musician is quite subtle as it touches on the forbidden love between two men who share a homosexual relationship, which is gravely prohibited in their society. The emotional payoff at the end of it leaves a brutal impact. The storyline taking place in the dystopian future of South Korea is equally compelling, especially with the Wachowskis' striking visual style, which pays sweet homages to science-fiction classics like 'Blade Runner' and 'The Matrix'. This one has the Wachowskis' handprints all over it. The 2012 London storyline has it moments with idiosyncratic humor and silliness, but perhaps not the most memorable or particularly interesting. The other three also have moments that grab at the heart with both emotional resonance and pulse-pounding tension, but it is hard not to feel that they could have been more fleshed out, especially when they task the actor with foreign accents that make their dialogue painful to understand.
 
As if balancing half a dozen storylines isn't a heavy enough weight to carry, the Wachowskis wield an interesting concept of casting each actor and actress in multiple roles spanning across each storyline, while associated them with more screentime to their main roles. Tom Hanks, easily the most recognizable, puts on a fine performance as the grungy tribesman in the sixth storyline, but journeys way outside his typecast with a series of goofy roles of characters cooked with occasionally laughable foreign accents and heavy prosthetics and make-up that often get a little distracting. It is awfully hard to buy Hanks as an 19th century English man with slightly seeding red hairline. Halle Berry does best in her role as both Luisa Rey in the 1973 storyline and the 2321 story, though she is slightly more memorable in the former. Hugo Weaving on the other hand, competes in his villainous typecast in each storyline, playing in roles that owe significant reminiscence to his role as Agent Smith in the 'Matrix' franchise. And here's a hilarious case-in-point, one of those roles is an elderly transgender woman. Jim Broadbent does his best in most of his roles, though perhaps his most memorable outing would be his shtick in the 2012 London storyline. Ben Whishaw and Jim Sturgress have their moments in their respective roles, but there is no doubt that they have done more remarkable works in the past. Cloud Atlas is destined to leave people divided in terms of structure, scope, and innovation. But that does not take away from the cerebral beauty that makes the film such a pleasant, if not masterful cinematic experience. The prolonged runtime will alienate some, but for everyone else, is an cinematic achievement that deserves to be embraced.",8,0,0,23 December 2017
300," Visually thrilling adaption to Frank Millar's graphic novel
","Based on the graphic novel by Frank Millar, 300 follows King Leonidas (played by Gerard Butler), who leads an army of 300 Greek soldiers to fight in war against the Persian army, thousand times their size. The film, as well as the novel, takes place during the Battle of Arthemis and Battle of Salamis which took place in 480 B.C. Zack Snyder, who would later go on to direct superhero flicks such as Watchmen (2009) and Man of Steel (2013) bring the artistic style from the graphic novel and brings it to life with amazing visual effects and a compelling story.Let's start by saying Gerald Butler delivers an incredible performance as Leonidas and really brings the life and energy to the character. I would say it's an Oscar worthy performance by him. The story is also pretty compelling as it follows the main character as he leads an army of hundreds of soldiers against an army they are overwhelmingly outnumbered by, and the story carries on quite well. What really stands out however, is the amazing battle sequences. From the second the soldiers wield their sword and shield, we are treated with flashy comic book-styled sword-on-sword action with some slow motion shots of soldiers getting slashed, stabbed, and dismembered with CGI blood spray. The first battle between the Greek and the Persian soldiers can easy be considered as one of the greatest battles ever put together in a movie. The battle against the giant ogre is also pretty stunning as well.300 maybe the best film by Director Zack Snyder and the best role by Gerard Butler. This action epic sets a prime example of how to adapt a graphic novel by Frank Millar into a entertaining thrill ride.",8,0,2,7 August 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," High-octane, violent, and decidedly over-the-top in its roots, Kingsman is a clever spy action spoof blooming with witty humor and style
","This spy action comedy sees English director Matthew Vaughn taking the classic James Bonds films and spinning them into a sweet, yet audacious comedic spoof. Following his success with 2010's 'Kick- Ass', which showcased a tongue-in-cheek approach at the superhero genre, Vaughn orchestrates a fast-paced action vehicle that echoes the classic 007 flicks, but with an over-the-top, stylized approach that allows for a reasonable examination of what an R-rated James Bond mixed with raunchy humor would resemble. Although the film proceeds with a mean- spirited streak and experiments with humor in unapologetic territory, Vaughn crafts his concept with wit and cleverness. There is rarely a moment that goes wasted in the final product. And most importantly, the film is fully self-aware of what it is and does not aim to take itself too seriously. That is the beauty of what makes Kingsman a hell of a lot of fun. This film follows Eggsy Unwin (played by Taran Edgerton), a young man in his early twenties, the son of a former British spy who was slain in a mission gone awry. Following his arrest for a petty crime, Eggsy come face-to-face with Harry Hart a.k.a. Galahad (played by Colin Firth) who introduces him to a secret spy organization known as The Kingsman, headed by Chester King (played by Michael Caine). Their goal is recruit spies and train them to defeat an maniacal millionaire tech genius named Richmond Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson). With a mind-controlling chips inserted inside the brains of millions of people around the globe, Valentine's evil plan is lead everyone on Earth to kill each other and start a new world order, and with Gazelle (played by Sofia Boutella), a martial arts woman with prosthetic legs with blades for weapons, on his side. So it is up to Eggsey and the rest of the Kingsman to stop his diabolical, or face an unspeakable global disaster. Matthew Vaughn clearly has his tongue in his cheek when approaching the classic spy genre, with characters spewing references of James Bond sporadically throughout the picture, along with the various action elements owing homages to the British spy of cinema. Does the director's comedic approach work? In many ways, absolutely. The movie follows a plot that is almost never meant to be taken seriously, as opposed to the more darker elements that escalate a few scenes. When the action kicks in, there is plenty of violence and a wild barrage of raunchy dialogue and humor taps at the funny bone, while echoing the bold comedic-style of 'Kick-Ass'. It is hard not to indulge in the fun of Colin Firth beating down the bad guys in a bar, while admiring the slick, stylized execution of the action. In the process, the director always keeps things moving and almost never lets any jokes go to waste. There are a few moments where Vaughn tends to push the envelop with his comedic streak, particularly for the conservative right. Easily the scene that best demonstrates this is one involving a violent massacre at Baptist church filled with a hatred-spewing congregation, apparently paying homage to Westboro Baptist. On the other hand, this film never fails to have a good time while allowing you to turn your brain off. Colin Firth demonstrates a humorous streak with subversive dialogue and raunchy jokes. Mark Strong, playing an ally of the Kingsman gets the job done. Samuel L. Jackson, playing a maniacal villain with the persona resembling Dr. Evil from 'Austin Powers', shines with suitable over-the-topness of a villain with a morbid, yet humorous energy. Then there is Taran Egerton, playing a naive young man going from zero to hero, who evolves with solid charisma.Kingsman: The Secret Service is a high-octane spy action comedy blistering with rewarding comedic energy and fun that is simply irresistible, at least for those who can skim past the questionably bold humor. Matthew Vaughn lives up to his directorial talent, surpassing the over-the-top superhero spectacle that was 'Kick-Ass'. To say the least, this movie is a total blast in the realm of graphic novels.",9,5,13,23 February 2015
The Hangover Part III," Unfunny second sequel brings its trilogy to a disappointing conclusion
","In 2009, we were introduced to the wolf pack: Phil, Alan, Stu, and Doug, along with Mr. Chow, who brought the insane hilarity and laughs on the silver screen when they woke up in Las Vegas with no memory of what happened the previous night and their soon-to-be- married friend Doug missing. Two years later, the wolf pack dealt with the same hilarious scheme, only to wake up in Bangkok with the younger brother of Stu's fiancée missing. Apparently, the critical failure of the second film didn't give a clear signal to director Todd Phillips for the series's retirement, and the result is a third film of the franchise that fails to bring the fun and laughter that made the first two films enjoyable.Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Doug (Justin Bartha), and Alan (Zach Galifianackis) are back once again with the film opening up Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) escaping from prison in Thailand, while evading a violent prison riot and guards who are after him. Meanwhile, Alan purchases a giraffe and decides to take it home on a trailer. However, when the giraffe's tall figure is too high for a highway overpass, the giraffe ends up decapitated and causes a major highway pileup. Soon, his family and his friends Phil, Stu, and Doug become increasingly worried about his mental wealth and proposed to take him to a mental institute called New Horizon. The plan quickly becomes thwarted when they are attacked and kidnapped by mobsters lead by crime boss Marshal (played by John Goodman) who assigns Phil, Alan, and Stu go after Mr. Chow who is in possession of half of his money, and capture him. With the three guys on the search for Chow, Doug is held hostage by Marshal and his henchman. This movie takes the characters to Tijuana and later, back to Vegas where the first film was set. Unlike the first two film, this one goes a whole another direction. Instead of the characters going out for a bachelor party for one of them who is getting married, and waking up with absolutely no memory of the previous night, this film has the characters going on a road trip to capture Mr. Chow who has become an international criminal. So basically, this acts more as a spy thriller than a hardcore comedy, and the results are a lack of laughter and humor to satisfy. The characters are not funny this time around, Mr. Chow isn't even funny anymore. While he manages to choke out a few humorous lines, his character seems warn out from laughter. Alan isn't even funny here either. The film tries to make him funny by simply making more dumb and more absent-minded than ever, but it fails to bring the laughs out. Furthermore, this film doesn't seem to try to be funny. There are many scenes that rather dark, including characters getting shot and killed, and Mr. Chow ends being more sinister than funny as he manages to kill a few animals in some scenes. The plot itself pretty much takes away all the hilarity and deprives the characters from their humor. This film may sound better than the second film for taking another direction, but sadly, it only ends up worse.The Hangover Part 3 is one of the most disappointing second sequels I have seen. It fails to be funny, it falls under a very poor script, and ends the trilogy on a really sour note. With you thought the second film was a disaster, that one was the only the beginning.",4,0,1,11 September 2015
The Thin Red Line," Terrence Malick's testament on horror of war stand powerful, even if it pedals on an uneven narrative
","Director Terrence Malick's take on World War II in the Pacific theater is powerful and honest as it is meandering. Following an unusually long twenty-year hiatus from the director's chair, this mysterious filmmaker racks up a large ensemble cast in this harrowing World War II epic based on James Jones's novel that pins its focus not on the grim reality of active combat but it the grim philosophy about how war can tear people apart from inside and out. Although Malick doesn't execute the grittiness of war the same way Steven Spielberg did in 'Saving Private Ryan', he makes a solid achievement on proving that war is hell and the bonding of brotherhood is one of the greatest weapons in active combat. The biggest problem however, that keeps this film from mounting near a masterpiece is the occasionally faulty screenplay that renders the film somewhat uneven towards its final act. Set in 1942 during the Battle of Guadalcanal, this film follows U.S Army Pvt. Witt (played by Jim Caviezel) who goes AWOL before being deployed with the 1st Battlion, 25th Infantry Division through the Guadalcanal Island of Japan. Lead by Lieutenant Colonol Gordon Tall (played by Nick Nolte), the team including Sgt. Edward Welsh (played by Sean Penn), Capt. James Starros (played by Elias Koteas), Pvt. Jack Bell (played by Ben Chaplinh), Capt. John Graff (played by John Cusack), Pfc. Don Doll (played by Dash Mihok), Cpl. Geoffrey Fife (played by Adrien Brody), Sgt. Maynard Storm (played by John C. Reilly), Lt. William Whyte (played by Jared Leto), and Sgt. William Beck (played by Woody Harrelson) compete in a brutal battle against the Japanese. In the process, they learn the true meaning of brotherhood as well as the grim reality of war.War is anything but a walk in the park, and Terrence Malick makes that explicitly clear throughout the sluggish 170-minute runtime. But unlike most contemporary war epics where soldiers' agony is depicted through a series of graphic combat sequences, Malick makes great use of visual storytelling to portray not only the nature of soldiers but also to explored their psychological being. And the alluring cinematography by John Toll beautifully captures the nature of every moment. Private Witt's background is greatly explored in a series of flashbacks with him and his wife, and the emotional agony it endures from the separation of her open doors to an emotionally powerful atmosphere surrounding the character. In the end, this character played by Caviezel remains as the only three-dimensional character among the overwhelming load of characters who are left in underdeveloped states (developing over a dozen characters just isn't easy). The philosophical dialogue and the emotional chemistry between the soldiers however, marks the film's most powerful edge, though nearly everyone with the exception of Sean Penn and Nick Nolte's character sadly uninteresting or even memorable. In the combat sequences when bullets start flying and bodies are torn by Japanese gunfire and artillery, there is rarely a moment when a death of the soldiers hits hard. At some points, it is very easy to forget which characters are dead or not. The performances are strong, but none of them manage to stand among another especially over the half of the cast members take advantage of only limited ten to twenty minutes on screen.The film pervades a powerful story that expresses both the harrowing reality of war as well as the ingenious philosophy that brotherhood is the greatest weapon that strengthens the survival of every men in the battlefield. There is an issue about the complex morality of the characters that is thinly explored throughout the story. War is deadly and the devastating effects it has on soldiers dead or alive are haunting. The combat sequences are significantly intense to watch, especially the raid sequence in the Japanese village (nothing close to the level of 'Saving Private Ryan'). Although the occasionally uneven pacing can serve a mild foible for impatient viewers, the real problematic turn comes towards the final act when the story begins a feel little disjointed and extraneous. It is difficult to escape the feeling that the film has multiple endpoints. Terrence Malick's philosophical undertones may provide some good emotional and humanistic gravitas, but it is barely enough to make up for how mildly uneven the story proceeds. Those who are able to get past this however, are most likely in for an engaging time.The Thin Red Line is powerful, if faulty World War II epic showering with marvelous performances and a beautiful direction, if flawed direction by Terrence Malick. While this film is not likely engage everyone looking for a sobering intake of the horrors of war mainly due to Malick's sophisticated style, it is a film that set to inspire as well as teach a harrowing truth on what war is.",7,0,2,11 March 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," John Wick returns for another ride of visceral action sequences with higher stakes
","If John Wick proved anything upon its release in the fall of 2014, it is not only that the action genre is still far from its deathbed but also that Keanu Reeves still holds his action adrenaline muscle he boasted during his years in the 'Matrix' trilogy. To say the least, it was a hyper-kinetic thrill ride that truly delivered. With Chad Stahelski returning to the director's seat, this film continues this story of the title character with a solid blend of frenetic action sequences and visual style. Similarly to the first film, this one delivers a heavy load of brooding action set pieces that mostly play roles in propelling the plot but nonetheless vend the thrills moviegoers deserve. However, it is Keanu Reeves that stands as the driving force for this action-packed vehicle. While the improvement upon the predecessor is rather thin to spot out, this film nevertheless gets the job done. Reeves reprises the role of John Wick who has shed away his gun, hoping to fully retire from his life as an assassin. However, when he is paid a visit by an Italian mobster Santino D'Antonio (played by Riccardo Scamarcio) who forcibly extorts him into doing one last mission, Wick is suddenly pulled into a crime underworld where he must travel to Rome to take out crime syndicate D'Antonio's sister (played by Claudia Gerini). He is appointed by the orders of a Continental Hotel owner and crime boss Winston (played by Ian McShane).This film doesn't quite improve upon the previous film beyond its action sequences and maybe a slightly more constructed plot. Overall, director Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves still successfully breath life into this continuation of the predecessor. The stakes are higher, the gunfights are bloodier, and the plot is perhaps on a bigger scale. The film opens with the title character already on the streets mowing down the bad guys, and the scene progresses into an intense car chase sequence punctuated with brutal hand-to-hand combat and countless gunshots to the head. This scene however, only marks the beginning of the lead character's gun-blazing rampage -- and there is quite a lot of it here. The plot takes on a globe-trotting journey to Rome where a good portion of the action sets stone, and from there John Wick comes face-to-face with some ruthless villains. Before too long, what evolves from a wild 'trust no one' mission turns into a violent, bloody showdown where gunfire fills the screen almost non-stop and tensions are sky high. And shall I mention the amazing cinematography done by Dan Laustsen who captures the striking visual beauty of both the action and the light-soaked environment of the downtown areas. As for the performances, Keanu Reeves is still strong and pulse-pounding as ever in the titular role; especially when showing off his action-charged testosterone. Riccardo Scamarcio does quite well and breaths plenty of life into the antagonist. As for Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane, and John Leguizamo who are stranded in more minor roles, they each certainly do their part for better or worse.John Wick: Chapter 2 is an entertaining action thrill ride packed with a hodgepodge of exhilarating action sequences, and striking thrills, and at best makes a worthy sequel for the 2014 surprise hit. It doesn't quite blow the first film out of the water as it stands rather neck-and-neck in terms of quality. But still, there is plenty of entertainment to be handed here. Among the films release in this early (and predictably lackluster) quarter of the year, this one stands out quite well.",8,6,12,16 February 2017
Jackie Brown," Light and weaker than Quentin Tarantino's other works
","When many hear the name Quentin Tarantino, odds are they are thinking of something of a masterpiece or at least something close to such. It's very difficult to deny this director has a God-given talent in filmmaking and storytelling, and the accolades he's achieved in his past twenty years of his career. This is not to say he's immune to some duds. Though his director has not yet been subject to any cinematic failures, a few of his works have proved to be less memorable and more shallow than others. Jackie Brown, a film following the success of the highly acclaimed masterpiece 'Pulp Fiction', feels less of Tarantino's style and much less excitement than his other works. Pam Grier plays the titular character, a middle-aged flight attendant who's tasked by arms dealer Ordell Robbie (played by Samuel L. Jackson) to smuggle $10,000,000 from Mexico to Los Angeles. When she's unexpectedly caught and arrested by two FBI agents (played by Michael Keaton and Michael Bowen) in attempt to smuggle a million dollars worth of cocaine in her purse, she is sentenced to prison but is ultimately released when she makes a deal with the agents to capture and arrest Ordell. Upon learning of Ordell's sinister plot, Jackie acquires the help of business fund manager Max Cherry (played by Robert Forster) to steal $1,000,000 from Ordell.Quentin Tarantino follows relatively the same style of filmmaking similar to his other works including the non-linear storytelling and interconnected story lines but manages to cut back on the over-the-top graphic violence that he's often known for, watering it down what feels like PG level in comparison. The film offers a plot that pays homages to 70s blaxploitation flicks. While there is plenty of substance to be experienced, the plot supplements little excitement and conveys at an unnecessarily slow pace, clocking at a 152 runtime that feels more like three hours. Without any sort of suspense or thrills to offer, the plot conceives a rather lack of tension. Quentin Tarantino is known for generating some of the most clever stories on film, particularly what we brought to 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. Unfortunately, much of the excitement conceived in those films is abandoned here. Luckily, there are a few twists and surprises sprinkled throughout that at least present some redeeming quality. The aspect in which the film greatly succeeds however, is building up strong character development along with some talented acting from an above-average cast. Pam Grief shows off an convince vibe as Jackie Brown. It may stand inside the Oscar range but there's no denying her performance shines. Samuel L. Jackson, returning to the Tarantino fare from 'Pulp Fiction' is good as ever, adopting his typical boldface personality. Robert Forster also comes off as impressive with his performance. The biggest disappointment though, is Robert De Niro who plays Samuel L. Jackson's sidekick and is decidedly underused for what could have been a compelling role for an actor like him.Jackie Brown doesn't quite scale the ladder like Quentin Tarantino's other films but there is some smarts to be experienced in what is a worthy effort by Tarantino, even if it doesn't succeed at a narrative scale. Those who are Tarantino fans are recommended to watch this, everyone else though will most likely to left with a shortage of entertainment.",5,2,3,23 May 2016
Gangs of New York," Martin Scorsese's tale of revenge and corruption comes with a grip
","From some of Martin Scorsese's crime classics over the past three decades, we have a seen the gritty and violent portrayal of life as a mobster thirsty for drugs and rank up the gangster ladder. This historical set piece however, sets the gangster genre in a whole another world that very few have seen before. This crime-drama takes us back to the Civil War-era when the South ran rampant with slavery and the North was left coping in mass corruption and crime. This soon lead to southerners rebelling against the Union that tried keeping slavery occupied while President Abraham Lincoln fought to abolish. This Martin Scorsese picture tells a grueling story of revenge and corruption in a gritty historical representation of New York, while tackling the gangster genre on an epic scale. Taking place in 1846 in the Five Points district of New York, young Irish immigrant Amsterdam (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) witnesses the cold-blooded murder of his father Priest Vallon (played by Liam Neeson) by the hands of Bill The Butcher (played by Danial Day- Lewis) who opposes the entrance of Irish immigrants in New York. Sixteen years pass, Amsterdam returns to the Five Points district where crime has ran rampant, riots run amok, and the town run by Bill The Butcher. There he meets an old acquaintance Johnny (played by Henry Thomas) who just so happens to work for Bill as well as pickpocket thief Jenny Everdeane (played by Cameron Diaz) who he develops a relationship with, while seeking revenge for his father's murder. Compared to Martin Scorsese's other works on his resume, this film doesn't reach the depth that makes it thoroughly compelling. Nonetheless, it is a captivating journey brought together by Jay Cocks' ambitious screenplay and the substance of Scorsese's direction. The beginning scene featuring the massive gang fight between the American natives and the Irish not only sets the story on an intelligent start but also offers one of the most pulse- pounding imagery ever put in a historical piece. The entire scene is exuberantly shot with powerful cinematography. With shots showing victims stabbed, sliced, and beaten with clubs and cleavers; it does get quite bloody and disconcerting to watch, but there is no denying the scene falls nothing of brilliance. The more ambitious aspect aside is the portrayal of the life in New York during the 1800s. The moody costume design, the flashy historical set design, and scenes featuring violent riots sum up to provide a deeply authentic representation of New York's nightmarish society during the Civil War-era. The narrative on the other hand, is where the film meets it's faults. Though the plot stand solid, there are a few places that lack substance. The romance between Leonardo Dicaprio and Cameron Diaz is not what I say terrible or cheesy but feels a little out of place. Overall, the film overcomes these flaws with a captivating plot dealing on the 'good versus evil' story between Amsterdam and Bill The Butcher. The conflict between the two is, at both a physical and emotional level, rollicking from when they first meet eyes to the powerful climatic battle towards the end. Thanks to the performances by Leonardo Dicarprio and Daniel Day-Lewis, these leads simply soar; though Lewis serves as the biggest show stealer here with his tyrannical portray of the corrupt main antagonist. The performance he gives so arresting, it's quite scary.Gangs of New York is an ambitious and fascinating revenge tale by Martin Scorsese featuring some supremely memorable performances by a talented cast. While this isn't Scorsese's most compelling picture, it is definitely memorable. Yes, there is plenty of violence and bloodshed to experience, but it only showcases a realistic portrayal of New York during one of America's harshest periods in history.",8,1,3,17 June 2016
The Cabin in the Woods," An inventive, tongue-in-cheek horror comedy with both scares and laughs to fuel the party
","With Hollywood running progressively low on fresh ideas for the horror genre, Drew Goddard and writer Joss Whedon become heroes of reinventing the horror genre in ways many fans may not expect. This teen- oriented slasher flick is by no means a newborn concept, but it offers a surprisingly sensational idea that scores the solid achievement of evenly balancing laughs with over-the-top scares and gore, while poking fun at typical horror movie stereotypes. The result is a slick comedy/horror hybrid that sustains with an execution that is undoubtedly silly, but not meant to be taken seriously, at least when it comes to spewing dark morbid humor at every turn. This horror- comedy follows five college friends head out to spend a nice weekend at the lake, while staying at a lone cabin deep in the woods. These college friends include muscle-head jock Kurt (played by Chris Hemsworth), his sexy girlfriend Jules (played by Anna Hutchinson), average, smart guy Holden (played by Jesse Williams), clean cut Dana (played by Kristen Connonlly),and an absent-minded stoner Marty (played by Fran Kranz). What starts out as a fun night of drinking and truth-or-dare quickly turns into a nightmare when a horde of zombie killers come out of nowhere and begin attacking. Now why does this happen exactly? Well, the hideous creatures are summoned and controlled by no one other than a group of technicians of a secret underground facility, where the teenagers are unknowingly being watched from hidden security cameras inside the cabin. So the teenagers must escape and survive against the chaotic, gore-filled monster onslaught.This is not your average, everyday horror film that some come to expect. Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon take the horror-genre and slaps it with a nice tongue-in-cheek approach that may feel reminiscent to Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' franchise. Mixing Truman Show-like elements with the monster invasion concept, this film sets it focus on a group of college-aged party animals who must survive against a monstrous rampage conducted unlike no way ever before. That is where the diabolical-minded scientists based in a secret laboratory come in. Using their cutthroat (and unrealistic) computer programming skills, this team of technicians become to villainous hand behind pitting the lead characters in a battle against an enormous variety of monstrous figures. With evil little creatures ranging from flying pteradactyls, to Gremlin-like little monsters, to killer unicorns, to plain zombie-like minions, the plot escalates into a bombastic, monster onslaught, eliciting just enough laughs, scares, and gallons of blood and gore to entertain audiences on both sides of the comedy/horror spectrum. These sequences are profoundly scary, but spare just enough elbow room from a few good laughs. In the process, the film takes fairly swell advantage of its silliness. If there is ever a point where the film's silliness slides past the line of necessary, it would most certainly be the ending which ends the film in a rather overblown fashion, even for the already goofy premise. Nonetheless, there is also an appealing cast to be offered in the bunch. Chris Hemsworth, Kristen Connolly, and Jesse Williams provide slices of charisma, while Fran Kranz becomes a source of gut-busting humor with his goofiness inherited by his pot-smoking behavior. Then there is Anna Hutchinson who operates as a little more than a surplus of titillation and eye-candy in two scenes during the second half, for better or worse. The Cabin in The Woods is an inventive, tongue-in-cheek comedy/horror entry with an appealing blend of over-the-top horror and comedic spirit. It is an entertaining ride for both comedy and horror fans, or perhaps anyone who can buy into the absurd premise. The film is not by no means meant to engage viewers at an intellect level. If you are not pursuing something particularly intelligent, then you have come to the right place.",8,0,2,16 October 2015
Spectre," A step down to the James Bond franchise
","The iconic British spy James Bond has been labeled a cinematic icon in Hollywood for over five decades since his on screen in 1962 film 'Dr.No' which had Sean Connery pinned to the role. From there on, the James Bond franchise has managed to impress audiences everywhere with spectacular action sequences, visceral storytelling, and the charismatic energy from the beloved spy. But it wasn't until Daniel Craig's debut in the franchise with the 2006 smash hit 'Casino Royale' when the series really started take flight. This follow up of the 2012 hit 'Skyfall' however, has some of the entertaining spirit of the titular character, but perhaps not the best of him I've seen in years. With Sam amended returning to the director's chair, this follows Agent Bond (played by Daniel Craig) who comes across a cryptic message from his late leader, which leads him to discovering from Lucia Sciarra (played by Monica Bellucci), a widow of an old criminal a deadly organization known as Spectre. With the help of a blonde hotshot Madeleine Swann (played by Lea Seydoux) who Spectre is set out to kill, Bond comes face to face with the organization's leader Oberhauser (played by Christoph Waltz) who he learns has a mysterious relationship with.This movie brings just about everything Bond fans should expect, tense action sequences, a powerful villain, a romance between Bond and a beautiful woman, and of course, a thoughtful storyline. This is not to say that this one stands as entertaining as the previous films, there are some cherishable value from the previous films that are sadly abandoned from here. The plot is the main aspect to gain this spotlight. While the plot begins with a stunning premise and introducing some compelling story elements, it begins to lose its touch after the first hour. It becomes less exciting and develops such as slow pacing. Along the way though is when we meet Lea Seydoux's character who Jamea Bond develops a strong romantic relationship with, and the chemistry between the two works surprisingly well. The performances stand out effectively and the characters remain likable throughout the picture. The biggest surprise director Sam Mendes brings the picture though, is the ingenious casting of Christoph Waltz as the main villain. Considering the profounding performance he brought to the 2009 film 'Inglourious Basterds', Waltz fits astonishingly well in the villainous role. He brings such visceral energy and charismatic tension to the character, easily one of the best villains brought to life in the Bond franchise. On top of it all, the film still manages to deliver excitement from spectacular action sequences, especially with the intense, pulse-pounding helicopter fight in Mexico City during the opening scene. Complete with amazing stunt work and cinematography, these scenes provide the energy and tension to keep viewers glued to their seats.Spectre is a bit of a step down to the Bond franchise and falls below the level of the previous Bond entries. Nonetheless, it still at least brings some of the James Bond spirit to the screen and thus, has just enough elements to make this installment worth watching. This film is in no means the worst film of the series, and it is far from it. If you are not a James Bond however, there are good chances you may not appreciate this one.

Joy," Jennifer Lawrence stands out above the subpar quality of this semi-biopic drama
","There is a lot to be said when it comes a biopics of famous figures, and plenty audience come to expect when going into a biopic starring a glamorizing cast directed by David O. Russell, an inspiring filmmaker brought a true sense of charm in films such as 'Three King', 'The Silver Lining Playbook', and 'American Hustle' (haven't seen The Fighter). Joy Mangano, an American entrenpeneur who gained high business status in the 1990s with her invention of the Miracle Mop and later developed patents on hundreds of other new products that rose the woman up to fame and earned her a spot on the cover of a Forbes magazine, is the central figure of this semi-biopic drama. The film stars the ever likable Jennifer Lawrence as the titular character, a woman living an overly stressful life in New York cramped in a house supporting her two young children, her mother Terry (played by Virginia Madsen), her grandmother Mimi (played by Diane Ladd), her overachieving and arrogant sister Peggy (played by Elizabeth Rohem) and later her father Rudy (played by Robert De Niro), an auto shop owner who is forced to move down in the basement with Joy's ex-husband Tony (played by Edgar Ramirez) who he doesn't get along with too well for his attitude towards him. In an desperate effort to make a difference and possibly provide more efficient support for her family, Joy becomes the mastermind behind a brand new product known as the Miracle Mop (as mentioned above) and with the support of company executive Neil Walker (played by Bradley Cooper) to sale the product on Home Shopping Network, she rises high in the business dynasty while battling the obstacles of business management.Business can get dirty and is not always an easy road and the film significantly underlines it. And with a filmmaker like David O. Russell in the director's chair, it's quite fair to expect more than just a straight forward story of a famous business entrenpeneur. However, the beauty and charm Russell brought to his previous pictures seem rather lost here. The film is only partially based on facts of Joy Mangano and her rise to business fame while part of it is fiction-based which is not a problem as long as it tell a story a cohesive story, a task this film fails to do. The storytelling is uneven and scatters all over the place, with seemingly non-stop flashbacks of Joy's childhood and later her marriage with Tony dotted throughout the storyline. The purpose behind these flashback sequences serves little importance other than expository, and at times hurt the flow of the story. By the end, the film feels it missed some opportunities in bringing together an engaging tribute to its real- life figure it centers on. Luckily, Jennifer Lawrence who's made her third collaboration with director Russell delivers a solid performance that anchors the film. She comes charming and likable in her role to where you come to care a lot about her character, you root for her success and become frustrated by the obstacles she faces when making her way up the business ladder. Bradley Cooper, another frequent collaborator of David O. Russell, is also quite engaging in his role but sadly shares a small amount of screen time than expected. Although Robert De Niro stands well here, his role along with the rest of the supporting characters, is cut short and feels less memorable than when he played Bradley Cooper's dad is Silver Lining Playbook.Joy may deliver a considerable amount of charm with some fine performances by some strongly likable actors, the film falls deep below the level of David O. Russell's previous efforts. It is not to say that the film isn't worth watching but certainly isn't something to expect as a powerful cinematic work of art like Silver Lining Playbook and American Hustle.",5,0,1,16 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Exhilarating post-apocalyptic action thrill ride
","It has been over 30 years since we've last seen Mel Gibson as Mad Max taking on a gang of street thugs on a deserted road. This year, George Miller reboots his post-apocalyptic franchise with Tom Hardy in one of his most engrossing film roles yet. Tom Hardy plays Max Rockatansky, a drifter and former captive who forms an alliance with a warrior named Furiosa (played by Charlize Theron), along with five women who were hostage by a cult leader (played by Hughs Keays- Byrne), in a vicious thousand-mile road battle against an army of bandits. Featuring an amazing cast including Nicholas Hoult, Rosie Huntington-Whitley, Zoe Kravitz, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton, this sci-fi action thriller demonstrates astonishing special effects, a compelling storyline, and some of the most amazing cinematography presented this year so far.I wasn't quite impressed with the original 1979 film with Mel Gibson. But upon seeing the trailer to this one, I had to give this one a chance, and when I watched this; I was absolutely blown away. The post-apocalyptic setting is so beautifully done, it gives the most authentic representation of a post-apocalyptic land I have seen in a long time. Even more amazing is the action sequences. As the film progresses, we are treated with prolonged car chases, complete eye-popping explosions, amazing stunts (similar to what you find the Fast and Furious movies), and outstanding cinematography that you will have your eyes glued to the screen. Tom Hardy does an amazing job as the lead character, and I was pretty shocked by Charlize Theron as the main female. They both work very well on screen together, and their performances shine bright.If the characters, special effects, and camera-work isn't enough, the film also boasts a deeply engrossing story. In the midst of all the insane action, the story never stops developing. The story is near- perfectly paced and never drags for one moment. George Miller does an impressive job at mixing heavy action with superb storytelling, not a lot of action films do that nowadays. Miller does it just right in this film. He takes time develop the characters and the plot, while delivering these long stretched flashy action sequences.Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best action of this decade so far. I can easily see one going down as a classic. If you haven't seen the original two with Mel Gibson, no need to worry. This movie pushes the boundaries of what action flicks are capable of. It demonstrates everything that an action film should be.",10,2,13,22 August 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Mel Gibson's testament on war pacifism packs a punch, and not without the grisly portrayal of war
","There are very few directors out there who portray the dark side of religion and war as powerfully as Mel Gibson. Looking back at the critically acclaimed 'Braveheart' and the highly controversial 'Passion of The Christ', Gibson's depictions of violence clashing with spirituality has proved to be far more effective than contrived; and this World War II biopic centering on the true story of a soldier driven by his firm spirituality to the take a different path in active combat instead of being a man carrying a gun in the midst of the bloodshed. His path is not to take the lives of others with the use of bullets, but save them. What could have been just your average faith-based drama feeling like a clichéd religious sermon ends up being a powerful testament of war pacifism and a man's challenge against the tyranny that targets his religious ideology. The film tells the true story of Desmond Doss (played by Andrew Garfield), a devout Christian and member of the Seventh-Day Adventist raised by his caring mother Bertha (played by Rachel Griffiths) and abusive alcohol father Tom (played by Hugo Weaving) strained by his experience in World War I. With World War II ravaging, Desmond enlists in the army as a Conscious Objector. During boot camp training, he faces causes displeasure in his drill sergeant (played by Vince Vaughn) when he refuses to touch a gun due to his religious beliefs. But when his platoon is deployed on the battlefield in Okinawa, Japan, Desmond proves to be more worthy as a soldier than many believe when saves over 50 wounded soldiers -- and doesn't even fire a single shot.One of the biggest ironies is how Mel Gibson cohesively makes a case of pacifism through an unflinchingly brutal portrayal of the horrors of war, and the story of how lead character Desmond Doss must face the violent nature of active combat that greatly conflicts with his religious beliefs. The first half of the film introduces Desmond as a young man who embraces his spirituality, while forced to deal with abusive upbringing by his father Tom who feels scarred by his son when he decides along his Howard (Desmond's brother) to enlist in the war, recounting his harrowing experience in World War I that costed the lives of his friends. Along the way, we are then introduced to hot-shot nurse Dorothy (played by Teresa Palmer) who Desmond quickly forms a relationship and provides some sweet moments of levity and connection for Desmond when he out overseas on the battlefields, though the depiction of their romance is a bit hokey and somewhat awkward during the first half-hour. Ultimately, the first hour is primarily about establishing Desmond's pacifism and the cruel nature in which he endures when he makes himself the center of ridicule by his officers and fellow comrades who view of his refusal of abandoning his firmly held conviction against fighting as an act of cowardly, which is gracefully brought together in the boot camp training sequences in the fashion of 'Full Metal Jacket'.Most of Mel Gibson's directing style shines through not only the performance aspect, but the incredibly realistic (and horrifyingly graphic) combat sequences. Shot with quality cinematography by Simon Duggan, the second half pulls viewers into the muggy heat of the Japanese battlefields as we watch the soldiers trudge the muddy fields little with decapitated bodies, dismembered corpses, dead soldiers rotting and getting fed off from rats; and the gruesome scenery firmly sets the tone for some of the most graphic and astoundingly authentic battle sequences since 'Saving Private Ryan'. If you recall the heart-wrenching Omaha Beach invasion in the opening scene, the battle sequences are here feel nothing short of an extension to this. With limbs blown off, bodies disemboweled, and heads torn apart; these combat sequences portray the hellish reality of active combat, and does so without feeling gratuitous or exploitative. Along with Mel Gibson's execution of war are some unexpected surprises that arrive from the performance department. One of which is Andrew Garfield as the lead Desmond Doss in a powerful performance that expands upon his ingenious talent compared to his ill-fated outing in the 'Spiderman' reboot franchise. Vince Vaughn, an actor slowly fading away from his series of dull comedies , delivers an R. Lee Ermey treatment in his role as the ruthless and intimidating drill sergeant. Though a little clumsy in some scenes, he manages pull off the rare feat of escaping into a sincere performance.Hacksaw Ridge is a powerful and deeply gripping testament on its lead subject's war pacifism, and marks a highly admirable directorial return for Mel Gibson. This film is certainly no cinematic landmark in the war genre, but it stands strong as one of the most profound films of the year. If this film manages to garner some Oscar nominations, it shouldn't much of a surprise.",8,8,15,7 November 2016
Warcraft," Visually striking fantasy adventure sadly lacks the characters and narrative to be compelling
","Following the success of his two science-fiction thrillers 'Moon' and 'Source Code', Duncan Jones has entered the realm of overabundant CGI ignited with motion capture technology; and this world happens to be a cinematic adaptation of the massively popular MMORPG (a.k.a Massive Multiplayer Online Role-playing Game) 'World of Warcraft', a game that lured in thousands upon thousands of players in a high class fantasy world through online social interaction and immersive gameplay. For many curious moviegoers and fans of the game, the question is does Duncan Jones effectively translate the popular source material to the screen, not exactly. In fact, the only aspect keeping this fantasy adventure from being a soulless disaster is the eye-dazzling CGI that brings the mythical world of life in a stunning visual treat, everything else from the characterization and the plot development is a bit of a slog. So what is this film about? It follows the story of a world called Azeroth that segregates mysterious creatures known as Orcs and humans. When a King Llane Wrynn (played by Dominic Cooper) of the human species and his brother-in-law Anduin Luther (played by Travis Fimmil) learn about a portal between the two realms is opened up by Orc warlock named Gul'Dan (played by (played by Daniel Wu) which leads to an attack against their realm by Orc warrior Duraton (played by Toby Kebbell), the two divided species engage in an all-out war, while each species questions the loyalties of their comrades.This film adaptation of the online computer game of the same name appears to going for another 'Lords of The Rings' knockoff, but without the substance and spirit uprooted from J.R.R Tolkien's source material. Furthermore, this fantasy action vehicle ends up being nowhere near the exciting fantasy spectacle its intended to be. Though it shines beautifully the visual effects department with the use of motion technology and CGI that supplements both the mythical Orc creatures and the magical world of Azeroth into a visually stunning paradise, the film squanders its source material on the charmless, unsatisfying adventure with a sorely inept script. The film proceeds with a premise of an escalating rivalry between the Orcs and the humans that eventually boils up when Gul'Dan, an Orc warlord opens up a portal to blast open the boundaries between these nations, but before long the plot ceases to make sense. The story hits us with so many twists and turns, it turns the plot into a complete jumbled mess; and the lack of any interesting characters certainly don't do it much justice. Throughout the picture, we are introduced to cookie-cutter characters who are so underdeveloped its difficult to even remember their names, except for those who are avid fans of the game franchise. And to make matters worse, the performances by the cast aren't very compelling either. Though the hack-and-slash battle sequences are somewhat exciting in style of execution and cinematography by Simon Duggan, particularly the over-head shot of the character flying down on the back of an eagle; there isn't a whole lot of charm to be delivered here.Warcraft is sad fantasy adventure wastes its potential on an unfortunate lack of compelling characters and narrative, though not without a little excitement from the tasty action set pieces. For those who are fans of the game series, there may be some silver lining to be found beneath the poor writing especially as fans are likely more familiar with the source material. Everyone else are most likely in for a disappointment, if not a disaster.",4,1,1,27 October 2016
Gladiator," Very riveting and entertaining epic brought together by Ridley Scott
","Directed by critically-acclaimed director Ridley Scott comes an historical epic action flick that embraces one of the most powerful tales of revenge ever put together on screen. Set in 180 A.D, this movie follows Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (played by Russell Crowe) in one of the most powerful Roman empires, who chosen by the favor of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (played by Richard Harris) to the throne of the Roman republic. This sparks incredible jealous in this son Commodus (played by Joaquin Phoenix) who the emperor deems as unsuitable for the job. Consumed with anger, Commodus murders his fathers and sends an army to murder the wife and child of Maximus. Vowing revenge of Commodus, Maxmius works his way up to the gladiator rank by fighting against the most powerful spartans in the gladiator arena, and his effort eventually leads to the fight of his life. Director Ridley Scott really outdone himself with this enthralling epic, shining more effort and incredible direction from his 'Alien' franchise. Scott polishes this film with a captivating story and masterful script that fuels with film from to start. Opening with an intense and harrowing battle scene between the Roman army and the Greek army that leads to countless bloodshed, the Gladiator boasts a story with such depth and energy, and uses some powerful characters like the main antagonist who is brought to life by the tour-de-force performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Commodus frightens audiences with his cruel and unsettling demeanor, and Joaquin Phoenix boasts such energy into this character, he makes it so believable. Russell Crowe also grabs the spotlight with his performance as the main character Maximus. While the film may not have the power to fill in for its occasionally humdrum pacing, it fuels its plot with some great writing and strives a strong narrative that audiences will not be given much of a choice than to sit through it.Gladiator is arguably Ridley Scott's best picture and one of the best historical epics put on screen. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are both outstanding in this film and deserve a round of applause. This is a film is worth watching for most, but those who are sensitive to graphic and bloody combat may want to stay away from this one.",9,0,0,24 November 2015
Contact," Contact challenges some thoughtful ideas, and the results are something deeply engrossing
","What are the possibilities of extraterrestrial life existing on other planets? That's a question mankind has been trying to answer for thousands of years. While the media has managed to hit us with snub footage or photos of UFOs to show ambiguous evidence with aliens visiting Earth, no official confirmation has made leaving many of the public as well as scientists all over the globe skeptical. The idea of public's search for evidence of extraterrestrial life and the media's response to highly speculated phenomenon is greatly explored is this science-fiction drama (based on a novel by Carl Sagan) directed by Robert Zemeckis and based on a well-known innovator of visual storytelling in the cinematic world. Juggling though-provoking ideas, emotionally-packed storytelling, and innovation of visual effects; this film sees Robert Zemeckis pedaling one of his bravest ambitions yet. This film stars Jodie Foster as Ellie Arroway, an astronomer searching for evidence of possible extraterrestrial life outside our planet, a speculation she's encountered since he was a little girl before her father (played by David Morse) passed away. Assisted by blind SETI scientist Kent Clark (played by William Fichtner), Ellie makes a great use of a powerful radio system when she suddenly hears bizarre noises from above the atmosphere indicating possible alien life. With the public including the National Security Adviser David Drumlin (played by Tom Skeritt) along with religious leaders and the government denying the validation of her research, Ellie must go far out of her away for prove everyone wrong.The biggest surprise Robert Zemeckis brings to the table other than a step from the typical alien invasion disaster clichés is adding something more thought-provoking to the genre and executing it in a way that will leave viewers filling their heads with questions. And it by many means, it is effective. Though some may argue that Zemeckis raises big concepts over storytelling, the style in which he crafts the story of Ellie trying to search for the truth about extraterrestrial life is enough for viewers to even considers this a valid flaw. The film journeys us through any emotionally touching adventure that explores a thoughtful idea that speculates how society (particularly the media) would react to the possible discovery of aliens existing on other planets. One of the main themes tackled throughout is the challenge between science and the belief in God, similarly how our country has challenged the issue between whether evolution or creationism is true. That is where Matthew McConaughey as the lover of Jodie Foster's character comes in as the religious philosopher who initially denies her ideas, but eventually becomes more worried about losing her than what the truth holds in her research. Though the plot doesn't go completely flawless, it sets out to be engaging and with the magic of the director's storytelling, it never feels ham-fisted. Aside from this, Robert Zemeckis also doesn't the story's emotional core nor an amazing use of visual effects for granted, he brings them to life and drives a story that really works.Contact is a thoughtful science-fiction drama that not boasts the amazing ambition of Robert Zemeckis' filmmaking, but strikes a thought-provoking core that will likely leave viewers with many discussions once the film reaches the end credits. And let's not forget the decent performances by Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey who give it their awe in their roles. All in all, the beauty of Zemeckis's filmmaking is too inspiring to ignore.",8,0,0,16 November 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Dark of The Moon sustains with overlong explosion-laden redundancy, but not without some improvement over its predecessor
","Behold the third entry of the Transformers saga. After the mediocre sequel that was 'Revenge of The Fallen' in 2009, Michael Bay has made his return to the director's wheel with a second sequel that manages to breath a just a little more life back in the franchise. It is loud and it is a very special effects heavy with lots of explosions, lots of destruction, lots of innuendo, and lots of screaming -- all of which is packed into a bloated 154-minute runtime. In addition, it slightly improves upon one major aspect that plagued the previous film, and that is boasting a more coherent plot with slightly more ambition. On the other hand, this does not eliminate the problems in Ehren Krueger's script which sporadically hinder the loud and overlong experience. Another change in this entry lies in the casting of Victoria Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who steps into the damsel-in- distress role, replacing Megan Fox was fired prior to production. This film tells the story of Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) who leads the Autobots in a race against the Decepticons lead by Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) to retrieve a mysterious Cybertronian artifact discovered by NASA back in the 1969 Apollo 11 mission. Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (played by Shia Labeouf) has graduated college and has just landed his first white-collar job to support him and his new girlfriend Carly (played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). When he and Carly are unexpectedly dragged into a heated war between autobots and the decepticons, they must enlist the help of the National Intelligence Agency, head by Mearing (played by Frances McDormand), to aid them in yet another battle on Earth. Michael Bay normally falls short of ambition when it comes to storytelling. The premise, which unlike the previous two installments, boast a surprising amount of substance dealing with the Space Race during the JFK administration. The story to is able competently connect landmark political history with the Transformers universe. But when it comes to sustaining the plot, that is where things falter. In return, he tries to make up for this an enormous slew of eye-dazzling action sequences complete with extravagant special effects and enough explosions to put dozens of firework shows at once to shame. Then it comes to the big question: are these massive special effects do enough to distract from the thinly developed plot? For a while, they do, especially for those with longer attention spans to parades of visual effects than the narrative. Bay indulges in his signature blow-em-up style with countless shots of the giant metal monsters punching, shooting, and slashing each other to pieces, a gimmick that gets taken to a bulky advantage in the final act during the climatic battle in downtown Chicago. The destruction of the skyscrapers is spectacular and fun to sit through, but goes on for so long to the point where it gets a little numbing. On the surface side, the performances are about as good as actors can get in the franchise. Shia Labeouf is fine in the role, and working along his side is Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, the model-turned-actress who turns into a rather one-note performance. Her role is rendered to feel identical to the fashion in which Megan Fox's character is written in the previous films, and that is serving as a sex symbol for teen boy, especially as she is introduced in the first ten minutes in a shot showing her lingerie- clad bottom. Arguably the most surprising new face in the cast is Frances McDormand who, like the actress she is, turns in a competent performance. Needless to say, it is nothing that shouts for wide recognition as is the rest of cast here including Ken Jeong who has a minor (and gravely obnoxious) role during the first half.Transformers: Dark of the Moon is an overlong, but somewhat competent special-effects action thrill ride that is likely to please those hungry for some explosive visual heft signature to Michael Bay's trademark directorial style, but disappoint those seeking for something more ambition. As far as many of Bay's films go, this one sustains a level of entertainment that is not too low, but too high either. Don't go in expecting something ambitious.",6,3,3,18 June 2017
The Social Network," Intelligent and well crafted biopic of the Facebook founder
","Facebook has been held position as the most popular social media website for almost a decade, beating other popular social networks like Myspace, Twitter, and one more popular towards the adolescent crowd Instagram. This biopic directed by David Fincher, focuses on Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook; and the story behind how it became the enormously popular social website it is today. Beginning in the fall of 2003, Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg) is a student at Harvard University who is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright (played by Rooney Mara). Upon the break- up, Zuckerberg creates a website known as 'Facemash' where users compare girls online based on their attractiveness. The website's high traffic causes a breakdown in Harvard's computer network, resulting in Zuckerberg to place under academic probation. During this time, he builds up a social media network known as Facebook which soon leads to a global success and lands Zuckerberg to a billion dollar business. However, he also faces conflicts with his friends in the process, pitted against two lawsuits, one by his best friend Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield), and the other by two brothers (both played by Armie Hammer) who accuse him stealing their idea. Thanks to the masterful writing by Aaron Sorkin and superb performances by its gifted cast, this biopic sparkles the legacy of Mark Zuckerberg's work and the story behind the creation of the globally popular website. Based by Ben Mezrich's novel 'The Accidental Billionaires', the film introduces us to the main character in the opening scene as someone not too likable due to his attitude towards his girlfriend, and later his friends. His ways of running his newly founded business leads to him squeezing his best friend out of business and making more enemies in the process. So Mark Zuckerberg is proved to be have been not the most desirable person to work with, but very intelligent nonetheless. Jesse Eisenberg brings such a sensational performance in what becomes his first Oscar-nominated role of his career. He looks so natural in his role that you almost forget its him instead of the character he is playing. Andrew Garfield who plays the main character's best friend that later turns into his enemy brings satisfaction to his role as well. Let's also not forget Justin Timberlake playing Sean Parker the founder of the computer sharing service Napster who later partners up with Zuckerberg in his business.The story works exceptionally well from start to finish, and the elegantly written screenplay by Aaron Sorkin should be credited for this. The film gently highlights the important points of the story based on the events that took place, and though there a few noticeable liberties taken from both the book and real-life events, Sorkin keeps the story solid and satisfying without overdramatizing or sugarcoating the events. The whole subplot dealing with the lawsuits against Zuckerberg are lavish the storyline, and director David Fincher handles this subplot in a solid manner. The Social Network is one of the most intelligent and well crafted biopics ever put to screen, and demonstrates some of the best filmmaking from David Fincher. This is an A+ film that everyone is strongly encouraged to watch regardless of they are users of Facebook or not.",10,3,4,30 December 2015
The Bourne Supremacy," Jason Bourne returns for another action thrill ride
","Matt Damon makes his return as the title character Jason Bourne, the CIA agent who was last seen in France on a mission to discover his past and evade the ruthless assassins that pursued him. This time however, Doug Liman who directed the previous film has reassigned to the executive producer with Paul Greengrass taking his place. More often than not, a change in directors during a film franchise tend to result in downward step in quality. Fortunately, Paul Greengrass appears to understand the heart and soul of the first film and manages keep it all alive in this sequel. Though it is hard to say whether this film improves upon the original or not as it does update in some areas but fall slightly short in others. Nonetheless, it makes a profoundly entertaining popcorn action flick. Matt Damon resumes his role as Jason Bourne who is now living in hiding in India with Marie (played by Franka Potente) after the events of the last film. Everything seems just fine between the two as they are living a happy, peaceful life together. That is until a mysterious CIA agent Kirill (played by Karl Urban) began following him around. Upon framing him for the murder of a former CIA agent, Kirill attempts to assassinate Bourne by the order of Bourne's former boss Ward Abbott (played by Brian Cox) and operation director Pamela Landy (played by Joan Allen) which goes horribly wrong. Soon, Bourne finds himself drawn back into the life he though he left behind and search for answers of what they want from him.This second installment delivers just about everything you'd expect from the following of the original. Like the first film, it's fast paced, delivers solid thrills, and shows lead actor Matt Damon in his spectacular, high-octane sense. From the first twenty minutes, we are introduced with a tense, frenetic car chase scene with Jason Bourne and Marie as they pursued by the devious Kirill who tries to kill our hero, and the scene ends in disastrous results that set the plot in motion. This entire sequence is nicely shot, as it is heart-racing and intense to sit through. The rest of the action revolves around martial arts combat between Bourne and the assassins that, though feature some slick choreography, suffer from ridiculous shaky camera work and quick cuts that try to illicit the intensity of the action but only make it difficult to decipher what's going on. It seems pointless to showcase such distracting camera work of the actors are demonstrating some decent fight choreography since nowadays filmmakers tend to use this gimmick to hide more sloppy choreography. Above all, the film's plot comes out on top, even more than in the previous film. With the lead character Jason Bourne more fleshed out, more knowledge of his past acquired, and a well conceived antagonist played by Karl Urban, the film shines on some improvement and makes for a story than viewers are more likely to become in engaged in, especially the ending which illicits Bourne in an emotionally powerful scene that largely defines his character. The Bourne Supremacy is a smart, crowd-pleasing action thriller sparked with terrific, if flawed action sequences, and a polished treatment of our action hero. Whether the film marks an improvement in the overall quality is difficult to say, but matters most is that it is highly entertaining and makes a must-watch for all action flick seekers.",8,1,2,30 July 2016
The Great Gatsby," Sensational and lively showcase based on Fitzgerald's novel
","Based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel that many of you were probably required to read in your English class in high school, The Great Gatsby tells the story of Nick Carraway (played by Tobey Maguire), a World War I veteran who resides in the fictional town of West Egg in Long Island during the 1920s Prohibition era, New York, who is introduced the astonishing lifestyle of his neighbor Jay Gatsby (played by Leonardo Dicaprio), a millionaire who owns an expensive mansion on the coast of Long Island and hosts parties of hundreds of attendees. While Gatsby is the most heard-of person in town, the man is full of mysterious of where he is from, where he obtains on his wealth, and what kind of person he truly is. What Nick learns is that Gatsby trying to win the heart of his (Nick's) cousin Daisy (played by Carey Mulligan), his former sweetheart who he abandoned years ago when he was deployed to fight overseas during World War I. Unfortunately, she is now married to her unfaithful husband Tom (played by Joel Edgerton). From there on, everyone is driven in a life of complication and unexpected tragedy.Leonardo Dicaprio reunites with Director Baz Luhrmann after their first collaboration in the modernized adaption to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet in 1996. Luhrmann blesses his film with such an incredible script and a captivating direction. The story is so elegantly written and is full of energy and cleverness. Leonardo Dicaprio once again leaves an everlasting impression with an ingenious performance as the film's titular character, and Tobey Maguire does a quite phenomenal job as Nick Carraway, arguably his best role of his career. The chemistry between the two feels so real and engaging and really keeps their characters alive. Gatsby is pretty captivating character throughout the movie. There are some things we never learn about him like he became so wealthy, but neither does Nick Carraway and that is the main mystery of the story and what makes his character so intriguing. Secondly, the production design is quite an eye-catcher as well. The beautiful construction and design of the sets such as Gatbsy's mansion are very gorgeous and give the film such an authentic representation of the 1920s. The same thing can be said about Nick's house and the design of the front yard. The set designs are very moody to where the audience will feel like they are not looking at the film sets, but actual images of the 1920s environment.The Great Gatsby is what I considered to be one of the sensational and most faithful film adaptions made, although there are a few changes from the novel. The performances are great, the storytelling is incredible, and the direction and screenplay is quite solid. Regardless of if you read the novel or not, the film is highly recommendable.",8,2,3,10 November 2015
13 Hours," Intense, riveting film inspired by true events and tragedy
","With January being the month of some of the biggest box office (and critical) slackers of the year, many would not expect to see high- budgeted movies; especially ones brought by Michael Bay who's films are often subject for summer releases. However, instead of a two and a half-hour stretch of giant robots fighting head to head, Michael Bay takes a more mature direction in epic war adaption to Mitchell Zuckoff's novel based on the harrowing events on September 11, 2012, the night when the U.S compound in Benghazi, Libya was unexpectedly attacked by Islamic forces, which resulted in the death of the American Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens (played by Matt Letscher) and two CIA contractors; an event that made national headlines. Actors James Badge Dale, John Krasinski, Max Martini, Pablo Schreiber, David Denman, and Dominic Fumusa hit the screen as the six members of the security team who set out to defend the compound against the Islamic militants. What the results is an intense, powerful, and thought-provoking war flick that raises many questions.This marks Michael Bay's third attempt at adapting a true-life event to the screen, with the being 'Pearl Harbor' and the second being 'Pain & Gain'; none of which come anywhere close to this solid attempt. This film paints a loud, but engrossing portrayal of the tragedy that occurred that night and the atrocity these soldiers went through, while steering away from the political territory; so there is no mentions of any political figures. Featuring extended scenes of loud, brutal combat with relentless gunfire, and of course abundance of explosions, the movie delivers a pack-punching depiction of soldiers' effort in active combat, to the point where you feel like you are the midst of the all the chaos; and these scenes are done not in a mindless, over-the-top way that Bay is often known for, but in a serious and authentic manner to make viewers feel the anguish of the characters. These scenes are shot on a nicely built set in Malta, which serves as a solid backdrop of Benghazi, Libya. The characters however, come as the film's weakness, with the character development falling short within the first hour. There is not much we learn about the characters other than them being as husbands and fathers, as shown with them having video chats with their families back at home. While the actors' performances stand strong, they're not quite enough to fully sustain their characters. 13 Hours is an intense, powerful movie that brings out the best of Michael Bay. It is a film that not only sparkles with a strong direction, realistic depiction of the horrors of war, but also pays a well tribute to the soldiers out there who are sacrificing their lives to defend the freedom of our country. It also shows that Michael Bay is capable of making decent films over some of the flops he's made in the last several years.",8,7,15,22 January 2016
Sully," Tom Hanks is the revelation of this Clint Eastwood-driven biopic
","Tom Hanks has soared as one of the most versatile actors in last few decades while Clint Eastwood on the other hand, has contributed as a major icon not only to Hollywood but American entertainment. So it is pretty easy to understand why many would have speculated a product of an actor like Tom Hanks and an ingenious filmmaker like Clint Eastwood. That is where this riveting drama centered on the major 2009 event known as 'The Miracle on The Hudson' comes into place. Clint Eastwood conducts the astonishing story of commercial pilot Chelsey Sullenberger who made a daunting decision to land an airplane on Lake Hudson following a failure of plane engine, a decision that many would expect lead to tragedy but instead ended with unexpected triumph. A gray-haired Tom Hank stars as pilot Chelsey Sullenberger (nicknamed 'Sully') in Clint Eastwood's retelling of January 15, 2009 when Sullenberger and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (played by Aaron Eckhart) were forced to make an emergency landing on the Lake Hudson after their plane engine was maliciously destroyed by a flock of geese in the air. When this fearsome stunt miraculously saves the lives of all 155 passengers on board, he is almost instantly held as a hero by the national public. However, Sullenberger also becomes a target of an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board that unexpectedly jeopardizes his career as well as his newly earned reputation.Clint Eastwood has a sense of livelihood in storytelling which he has best exhibited in his previous few entities. This one is almost equally as riveting as you could come to expect from a Clint Eastwood entry, though it follows a slightly odd story structure. This biopic opens with the titular man immediately in the plane in a jarring flashback of the aforementioned disaster, then the story strolls through the aftermath of the harrowing debacle as the man is almost senselessly falls under scrutiny by the National Transportation Safety Board. It is not until around the halfway point when we witness the mid-air catastrophe which is done realistically. With writer Todd Komarnicki providing a hefty hand for the script, the film paints a mesmerizing portrait of the heroism that defined Chelsey Sullenberger on that fateful day while shining clear light on how heroic actions don't always come without a cost. And without the need to villainize the National Board (at least not in an over-the-top way), Eastwood provides us with a sensible look at both legal and psychological repercussions that threaten to tear Sullenberger apart as the person the public deeply admired him as. As the story moves on, Clint Eastwood accomplishes the essential task of pushing depth of the lead character including the psychological aftermath that disturbs his inner being. On top of it all, the real revelation in the mix is Tom Hanks. Now pushing his sixties, Hanks strives with a powerful performance as the spirited lead character, a role that allows him to shine like gold. Though this does not mark the first time Hanks has ignited the role of a real-life tragic figure as he portrayed the titular role in Paul Greengrass's 'Captain Phillips' in 2013, he provides just enough emotional gravitas to make for a memorable role. Even if he doesn't quite pack the same visceral energy he did the 2013 biopic, his performance still demands for admiration.Sully is a riveting biographical drama blooming with the likeliness of Clint Eastwood's solid direction and Tom Hanks' blissful talent in the performance department. It is a moving picture that unfortunately doesn't quite fall in the crowd of Eastwood's most masterful features. But in the end, the film paints a smart, triumphant tribute to the heroic Chelsey Sullenberger, a man that many still admire to this day.",8,0,0,2 January 2017
Jurassic Park," An astonishing science-fiction adventure set with landmark special effects marks one of Steven Spielberg's finest works
","Over the many years in his directorial career, Steven Spielberg has proved he is more than capable of collaborating with nearly every genre in the cinematic roster. This science-fiction adventure based on Michael Crichton's novel exhibits the absorbing talent of the influential filmmaker. In short words, this film is an eye-catcher in both its story and state-of-the-art special effects. Clashing together the prehistoric age with the present, this movie drops its character in the blistering heat of a battle against dinosaurs, who are polished with one of the most eye-popping computer-generated imagery ever put to screen; effects that still hold up to this day. But whether or not the film is faithful to Crichton's source material is not wired to my knowledge. It is terrifying adventure, but is one that manages to bring on the thrills and tension that make it a wild ride for the whole family. That is if the children can handle the immense scare factor of the giant dinosaurs causing mayhem. This movie stars Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, a biologist who opens up wild attraction on a remote island known as Jurassic Park where dinosaurs are brought to life by genetic engineering. Coming along for the ride is writer Grant (played by Sam Neill), his partner Ellie (played by Laura Dern), animal biologist Dr. Ian Malcolm (played by Jeff Goldblum), and Hammond's grandchildren Timmy (played by Joseph Mazello) and Lex (played by Ariana Richards). When the tour around the park goes awry and dinosaurs become hostile, the group along with several other tourists are pitted in a terrifying fight for survival.Steven Spielberg left a cinematic landmark on summer blockbusters with his film 'Jaws', a movie that left many terrified of going back into the water. Here marks another creature feature where the main villains of the story are prehistoric monsters who pick off humans one by one. And with hair-raising suspense and jaw-dropping visual imagery, Steven Spielberg showcases the characters' fierce vulnerability in a thoroughly effective manner. There are some truly scary moments sprinkled throughout the second half, some characters meet their ends in dinosaurs' bellies and children are in deep danger. For instance, the scene featuring the dinosaur's big eyes are peering through the windows of the truck where the young children are crammed, ready to make a meal out of them is a spine- chiller. But Spielberg effectively illustrates these moments in an effective fashion without veering into the horror territory. One of the absorbing aspects of these sequences is captured through astonishing computer-generated effects that bless the giant monsters including the velociraptors and tyrannosaurus rexes with a realistic feel. And visual effects wizard Stan Winston who did the effects for James Cameron's 'Aliens' is to thank for this. As for the performances, everyone does quite a solid job. Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are both equally charismatic as is Richard Attenborough in his role. Laura Dern and the young child actors make good use of their roles as well. If there is anything missing, it may be proper character development. But it just shortcoming that plenty of viewers can almost easily skim over. Jurassic Park is a fun-filled science-fiction adventure operated the hands of Steven Spielberg. It is scary, but it is also exciting to the point of leaving viewers alternating between cheering and leaning at the edge of their seats. Although there is no doubt that some children of the single-digit age crowd will find themselves scared, this still makes for a fine family-oriented entertainment.",9,1,2,28 April 2017
Beetlejuice," Tim Burton's spooky tongue-in-cheek vision effectively sells this Gothic horror comedy in life
","Mixing elements of Gothic horror and comedy can be a tricky stunt to pull off. Director Tim Burton however, manages to do just that in more than ways one. And if you know the director well enough, you'd know that resorting to usual Hollywood conventions isn't part of his norm. We are talking about a director takes his quirky vision and places it full-throttle to create an entertaining horror-comedy feast that supplements both laughs and scares. His vision is what makes this quirky, yet effectively engaging Gothic horror piece work. Imagine a world where Michael Keaton played a goofy green- haired lunatic that made The Joker look like a cute little snuggle doll by comparison. This concept is brought to life in this infectiously bizarre comedy- horror salad that see Burton exercising his signature style to full extent, pushing the boundaries of youngsters' dark imaginations, but not without having his tongue in his cheek. This film follows Adam (played by Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (played by Geena Davis), a married couple who are driving on a bridge when they swerve off-course while dodging a poor little dog. When the fall ends up killing them, they wake up in the afterlife where their house is being a sold by a family consisting couple Charles and Delia Deetz (played by Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara respectively) and their emo teen daughter Lydia (played by Winona Ryder). Since they (Adam and Barbara) are ghosts, Charles and Deila can't see or hear them. However, it is Lydia who has the mysterious ability to communicate with them. In an effort they scare the family out of there house, the couple must cross paths with an erratic, fast-talking clown only known as Beetlejuice (played by Michael Keaton). It is only too bad that the clown has a more devious plan they do more harm than good. Wacky and peculiar are the most suitable words to describe what kind of ride you are in for. But as this is Tim Burton, bizarre is what most people should expect. This features Michael Keaton in a role that defies against the usual good guy tapestry that he would resort to later on his career. Keaton exercises the role of the quirky clown-being with appropriate over-the-topness and macabre-type comedic energy that lends plenty of humor to leave audiences snickering beneath the dark Gothic nature of his character and the film itself. The movie has moments of laughter, but most certainly not in the way that will leave you busting your gut with guffaws. After all, it is dark humor that defines the underlining comedic tone while the spooky imagery triumphs over the absurd wackiness. To be more specific, the vast portion of the imagery lies within the world of the afterlife where Adam and Barbara encounter deceased victims who have faced very unpleasant deaths such as a man who has been burnt to meat, an elderly lady who smokes and exhales through the slit in her throat, a headless man, and a later sequence when one of the characters is tasked to pop her eyes out of her skull. And yet this film somehow managed to pass with a PG-rating in an era that introduced the PG-13 rating by the release of the war film 'Red Dawn', not to mention that Keaton also drops an F-bomb in one scene. Nonetheless, Tim Burton brings an expert hand at keeping things moving, and Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis sell themselves in their roles just fine. If there is any detriment to Burton's vision, it is, of course, time as the special effects he incorporates some sequences such as the lead couple being chased by a giant sandworm has grown hideously outdated. And the musical number at the end feels somewhat out of place. But whether Burton is trying to frighten us with his nightmarish imagery or amuse us with the quirky nature of the characters, particularly the eponymous character, he is always inviting us in for the laughs.Beetlejuice is an entertaining piece that mixes comedy and horror in an eccentric fashion that truly works. With all grotesqueness that showers the film, some may question whether it makes for an appropriate children's movie. For my answer, probably not without parental guidance unless the youngsters who dare to watch this are immune to nightmares induced from Tim Burton's campy visual imagery. But with the macabre humor injected into the film's veins, there is enough camp to make for a nice treat for both adults and preteen children alike.",8,0,0,11 October 2017
Valkyrie," Although the movie may not leave a powerful impact, it is nonetheless an absorbing account on the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler
","For a brutally profound subject matter such as the attempted assassination of Germany tyrannical leader Adolf Hitler, it takes an immense amount of talent both in front and behind the camera to capture the alarming atmosphere of an event that supposed to be a turning point for Europe during World War II. Bryan Singer, famed from his work in 'Usual Suspects' and the 'X-Men' trilogy, takes a stab at portraying the violent events leading to the failed slaying of the ruthless Nazi leader responsible for the mass execution of over six million Jewish lives. His efforts in some degree do a little justice to the men involved in the notorious plot. By no means does the film carry the powerful gravitas that leaves a powerful impact nor does it strike a chord with a visceral execution. But one of the few things both Singer and the cast on screen manage to accomplish is capture the absorbing tension in a plot that could meant life or death for millions of European lives. This film follows the July 20th 1944 attempted assassination of Third Reich leader Adolf Hitler (played by David Bamber). With Germany accepting the inevitable defeat against the Allied Powers, they believed that the only way war could end peacefully in the European front is eliminating Hitler. Recruited by General Friedrich Fromm (played by Tom Wilkinson), German soldier Colonel Claus Van Stauffenberg (played by Tom Cruise) leads a team of soldiers including Major Henning Von Tresckow (played by Kenneth Branagh) and his compatriot General Friedrich Olbricht (played by Bill Nighy) on a mission to take down the Fuhrer and overthrow the renegade. As the clock is ticking, the soldiers are caught in the crossfires of German officers who grow increasingly suspicious of their dubious intentions. It is no surprise that the mission was a tragic failure for both sides of the compass as it would be a year later before Hitler finally met his end. While we know how things end, the important aspect is how successfully Bryan Singer crafts the trajectory of the events that lead to the forecoming tragedy. More of a conspiracy thriller than a war film, the film has a fair baggage to offer in the midst of its complex war history. With countless lives in danger of Hitler's tyranny, Singer makes ambitious effort to keep the stakes high and the suspense in the following the diabolical plan against the Third Reich. This accounts to some palpable tension each scene after General Stauffenberg and his colleagues spring into the action. Although the plot is not all firefights and explosions erupting through the air, Singer certainly knows how to keep a decent pace without leaving too many moments feeling wasted. One major flaw lying within the execution is the failure to capture the visceral energy of the action. Along the way, however, the story plants plenty of interesting concepts on the tension between Germany and the Third Reich, enough that will provide you with plenty of food for thought amidst the complicated politics surrounding the war in the European front and the shock waves perpetrated by Hitler's Nazi occupation. As for Tom Cruise, the fine actor does a splendid job capturing the gritty nature of General Stauffenberg, the man fighting the save the future of Germany from Hitler's wrath. While the American actor may not carry any German descent, it is safe to say he fits the bill. He is greatly supported by an English cast of Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, and Kenneth Branagh -- each of whom play characters of different nationalities than their real-life personas. If there is anything missing in their roles, it is the ability for the audiences to grow an emotional attachment to them. Valkyrie is an intense, tension-driven conspiracy thriller that may capture the heat of its uncompromising subject matter, but sadly falls short of the visceral impact that could have left a lasting impression. Despite this, it is an intriguing picture with a load of thought-provoking material worthy of discussion once the film reaches it conclusion.",7,0,1,11 August 2017
Alien: Covenant," Scary and visually impressive, Ridley Scott's Alien: Covenant seals a thrilling fresh return to the franchise
","The Alien franchise has been driven with ups and downs for over the past three decades. Its most troubled history was greatly redeemed in 2012 when Ridley Scott helmed a prequel to the franchise 'Prometheus'. Following his return to the franchise, only some would expect that his next project to the series would be a bridge connecting the stories of Prometheus and 'Alien'. Visually stunning and suitably scary, this film following the events of the former sees Ridley Scott returning with his immersive talent in visual storytelling and direction to bring this grounded story to life. What the director fails to bring however, is new ideas to the franchise which will serve as a minor burden for some, but leave others who are less demanding for a game changer satisfied. As a result, this new installment to the series is scary and thrilling as ever, and not without the admirable talents both in front and behind the camera. This film follows a space crew aboard a spaceship called The Covenant. Consisting of members including the humanoid David (played by Michael Fassbender), Dany Branson (played by Katherine Waterson), Christoper Oram (played by Billy Crudup), chief pilot Tennessee (played by Danny McBride), Sergeant Hope (played by Demien Bichir), and Christopher's wife Karine (played by Carmen Ejogo); the crew sets out to investigate a distant planet, only face an unspeakable extraterrestrial terror that awaits them. If there is anything disappointing about Ridley Scott brings to the table, it may the lack of new ideas to the series; whereas the previous film introduced more complex themes such as the debate between creationism and evolution. Scott, nonetheless, proves that he knows how to deliver a thrillingly effective ride. From the gorgeous imagery in and outside the spaceship, to the breathtaking cinematography Dariusz Wolski, this film engages viewers with a powerful visual heft while lighting fire to a pulse-pounding, tautly-paced story that takes them on the darkest corners of a vicious alien onslaught. When the mission goes awry and several crew members meet their gruesome ends at the hands of flesh-eating xenomorphs, Scott almost never fails to deliver the edge-of-your- seat thrills as well as drenching the screen with a reasonable amount of blood and gore. With aliens once again bursting out of human bodies and snacking on human flesh in a blood-fueled fiasco, this is a terrifying ride that only those with a strong stomach should board, while the rest are likely the find themselves curling into a ball. One of very few moments of levity stands when they find shelter on the distant planet they believe is safe haven. But it is only a matter before the sense of hope turns to dread when we and the characters learn that his uncharted planet is the only the beginning of their nightmares. The final twenty minutes, while somewhat effective, mark when the movie ceases the challenge against expectations and begins to rely on heavy predictability. The death of characters are scary, but perhaps less effective when you see them coming miles upon the horizon, let alone how the movie fails to take its time developing some of the characters. With Michael Fassbender standing as the only returning member from the 'Promotheus' crew, the movie introduces an all-new cast with a number of A to B-list actors to the bunch. Stepping in the shoes of one of the main characters is actress Katherine Waterston, arguably best known for her role Chrisann in 2015 biopic 'Steve Jobs'. Waterston's performance is definitely on point and certainly more admirable than her character. If you go in expecting something of Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley, you will likely be targeted for disappointment. Billy Crudup, Demien Bichir, and Carmen Ejogo bring their A-game to the roles, but the staleness of their characters sadly set them with only little to work with. There is one major surprise however, that a very few may come to expect in a science- fiction horror picture, and that is the performance by Danny McBride. Stripping away from his rowdy, comedic typecast, McBride ignites a fair amount of maturity in his role, although nothing that blows anyone of the cast out of the water. After all, the sharpest and most versatile figure in the crowd here is Michael Fassbender who shines with plenty of emotional gravitas and potency in his role as David. To add on icing on the cake, his talent is greatly challenged in a role involving a subplot (which shall not spoiled) that is surprisingly effective and adds gravity to the already compelling storyline. Calling this role for attention of an Oscar may be asking for a lot, but it's not too unreasonable.Alien: Covenant is a scary, yet thrilling fresh ride that manages to build a bridge between Prometheus and Alien with unexpectedly satisfying results. On both a visual and a narrative scope, this movie is a smart, if somewhat predictable experience that may not grab the attention of those unconverted to the franchise (or at least with Prometheus) but effectively shows the bright side of both the franchise and Ridley Scott's impressive directorial talent.",8,21,43,1 June 2017
The Martian," Amazing, visually stunning gift from Ridley Scott
","From director Ridley Scott, the amazing visionary behind the sci-fi classics such as Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982), and Promtheus (2012), comes any visual stunning science fiction survival flick with splendid visuals and superb storytelling. Matt Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney whose team is sent on a mission to Mars. The mission goes terribly wrong when an intense dust storm hits and Watney is hit with debris and presumed dead by his team. Before too long, Watney wakes up and reveals to be alive, but is now stranded alone on a deserted planet . Watney must put his skills and intelligence to the test in order to survive, while NASA and his team work together to rescue him and bring him back home. This involves planting crops with Mars soil to grow a yearly supply of food. This film features the talented cast of Jessica Chastain, Kristin Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, Michael Pena, Sean Bean, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.Upon seeing the trailer, I was quite excited for this movie. This is the best science-fiction I've seen since last year's Interstellar. This film runs for two hours and 21 minutes, but Ridley Scott always keeps it captivating from start to finish. There is very rarely a dull moment if any. Matt Damon's character Mark Watney manages to reduce the intense atmosphere with his optimistic and sarcastic attitude, spitting out hilarious one-liners here and there. In the trailer, he presented some of the most clever one-liners such as 'I'm gonna need to science the s**t out of this' and 'In your face Neil Armstrong', probably some of the best lines I've heard in a long time. So the film carries a comedic undertone to it in the amidst of the seriousness. The supporting characters have their witty moments of hilarity as well. The performances by Damon and the rest of the cast were pretty solid and deserve big thumbs up.The visual effects and cinematography are the biggest attention grabbers here. With Wadi Rum Valley in Jordan serving as a backdrop of Mars, audience are treated with the most realistic depiction of Mars ever shown in cinema. With the red-tinted saturation and lighting, it gives them the look like the film is actually shot in The scenes set in outer space are quite eye-popping. Another delightful aspect is the storytelling. Unlike most sci-fi films where there is a frequent sense of urgency, this film carries a very hopeful tone and the characters remain optimistic about their goals to save the main character after he gets stranded on a planet where no life exists (yet!). While it may disappoint some due to the lack of surprise elements, it stays very human-like and engrossing to where it keep the audience glued to their seats.The Martian is a must-see for all sci-fi fans, and perhaps everyone else. Matt Damon is amazing in this and the story never disappoints. I believe this film has some Oscars on the way for Best Visual Effects and Best Cinematopgraphy (possibly Best Sound editing). Have a theater near you? Go see this!",9,4,10,12 October 2015
The Fighter," The Fighter is a triumphant piece of cinema from beginning to end
","Over the last few decades, the sports genre has become a home of seemingly endless clichés and entries with predictable endings. Though there have been some surprisingly pleasant (and occasionally original) sports flicks, it is almost difficult to deny the overpopulation of formula the genre continues to throw at us. Director David O. Russell however, grants us with an idea that though isn't empty of formula or particularly original, feels fresh by execution and writing. Tackling on the true story of middleweight boxer Dicky Eklund and his young brother Micky Ward who followed in his footsteps, this biographical drama showcases not only the triumph of David O. Russell's directing but the powerful performances by it's endearing cast. Based on true events in 1980s New Jersey, the film follows the story of Micky Ward (played by Mark Wahlberg), a recently divorced lightweight boxer sprawling his way to score the championship title with the help of his half-brother Dicky Eklund (played by Christian Bale), a former championship boxer who's career took a downward spiral from his drug addiction. After suffering a humiliating loss, Micky finds his chance of making to the championship threatened. From there on, he meets bartender Charlene (played by Amy Adams) who he quickly falls in love with. Soon, when Dicky's petty crimes land him in jail, his relationship with Micky and their already dysfunctional family is put to the test that threatens to not only destroy his chances of winning the championship title, but tear the family apart altogether. The most important thing in life is family, a powerful message this film packs in. And with David O. Russell's profound direction, the movie falls nothing short of riveting; even if it's little predictable in some spots. Instead of relying on heavily on the lead character's journey as a boxer fighting to reach the championship rank, the plot explores through family dynamics with Micky's family and the dysfunctional relationships that plague the everyday life. His parents, played by Melissa Leo and Jack McGee, are constantly at odds with one another and struggle trying to balance their parenting with their seven daughters and their two sons Micky and Dicky. This results in multiple scenes of verbal sparring that are both intense and emotional to sit through. When Dicky lands himself in prison, the family is forced to face emotional obstacles that place a strain on them, and David O. Russell's maps this out in a way that's more riveting than formulaic. When Micky and his family face these troubles, he learns his only chance of redemption is overcoming his inner demons and making things right with his troublesome brother. Yes, there are some boxing scenes which are brilliantly shot with sheer authencity, and of course the usual training montages you see more often than not. But it is the tumultuous relationship between the two lead characters that plays the vital role in the story. Aside from this is Mark Wahlberg giving one of the most astounding performances of his career, but nowhere near as profounding as Christian Bale who embraces his role with powerful emotional heft that is difficult to ignore. Another shocking performance comes from Amy Adams who is equally tremendous, but also more feisty and aggressive than the roles she's often known for. In fact, one scene includes her engaging in a fist fight that ends in a broken nose. The story would be nowhere near as powerful and compelling if it weren't for the astounding performances this cast delivers.The Fighter is a triumphant piece of cinema that never feels contrived or uninspired in any sense. From the astounding performances and David O. Russell's witty direction, this film is easily one of the best films of 2010. No, this film is not another 'Rocky' or 'Raging Bull', but it doesn't have to be. What makes the film entertaining is that it's smart, moving, and demonstrates a cinematic effort worth admiring.",9,0,1,28 August 2016
Law Abiding Citizen," This man versus law story starts off with a promise, but eventually dives into the preposterous territory
","Our society is very complex when it comes to dealing with the law enforcement, and the flaws in the justice system set a clear example of that. This concept marks the core of this crime-thriller which places Irish actor Gerard Butler in the role of a man seeking vengeance against the court system who failed to meet into his emotional demands. And how does everything go down from there? Well, the film, directed by F. Gary Gray, starts off on a promising note introducing us intellectual themes of corruption and negligence within the justice system, both things that have been reported on the news for the past several decades. But once it comes time to kicking the action into gear, that is when things go south. Slipping into the territory of absurdity, the film proceeds with a plot that feels more heavy- handed than genuine. There are a few elements that Gray gets right, and that is providing us a few good thrills and action set pieces. His major problem is showcasing the shock and fury of Gerard Butler's antagonistic character. This film follows Clyde Shelton (played by Gerard Butler), a husband and father who's night of peaceful family time is disrupted by ruthless gangsters who invade his house and murder his wife and daughter right in front of him. While one of the gangsters is caught and receives the death penalty, the other, Clarence Darby (played by Christian Stolte), is offered a plea bargain by lawyer Nick Rice (played by Jamie Foxx) who will allow him to testify against his accomplice for the crime. Shelton is not too pleased about this and feels no justice has been served. Ten years later, the law enforcement finds Darby gruesomely murdered and Clyde reveals to be the one responsible. Upon sending him behind bars, Nick Rice learns that he is waging war against the him and the district attorneys to deliver them the message about their corruption. F. Gary Gray's legal thriller is not your average turn-off-your- brain popcorn flick, at least not in concept. There is some smart commentary offered by the corruption behind the justice system, particularly the flaws in judges' failure to serve justice and letting the morally corrupt run free with little to no legal repercussions. We have heard of this many times in the past, particularly when we turn on the news and hear court cases gone awry to the judges' mistakes of recognizing the grim nature of citizens who wrong against society. This intellectually-engaging theme sets the stone for the film's strongest point. Everything else feels a little blemished. In response to the court's decision against his favors, Gerard Butler's Clyde Shelton becomes the driving force of the plot as he ensues a brainy plan to seek vengeance against the justice system. He is smart and way of the game, but his evil doings more often than feel a bit too ham-fisted than believable -- this is best demonstrated in the scene in which tortures his victim in the style of a 'Saw' movie. While it is easy to understand his sadness and frustration, our sympathy for him quickly dissolves when the story dives into his absurdly sadistic nature. It might have been more easy if the film is portrayed him in a more humanly manner than a exploitative psychopath with a thirst for blood. Although this dubious methodology opens doors for some pulse- pounding thrills and bloody action set pieces to feed on, the plot feels a bit too absurd to take seriously and builds up to an ending that simply doesn't land. Gerard Butler is not bad in the role, his only problem is the writing of his character which. Jamie Foxx on the other hand does fine in his role, reeling in charisma and humanity, while trudging through the preposterous nature of the script. Law Abiding Citizen is a flawed man versus law thriller that may sparkle with an absorbing message on the flaws in the justice system, but falls short to a superfluous approach of its story. This movie is nothing truly memorable. But the say I can say about it is that it is not a lumbering disaster. After all, there is a good side to be admired about F. Gary Gray's direction, that is if you can get past the stilted fashion of the plot.",5,0,0,31 July 2017
V for Vendetta," Violent, complex, but fascinating adaption of Alan Moore's graphic novel
","Corruption, graphic violence, and complex political themes supplement together in this visually striking adaption of David Lloyd and Alan Moore's hit graphic novel. Driven by a visceral direction by director James McTeigue, this dystopian action thriller captures the powerful energy of both Alan Moore's brilliant source material and the captivating (but convoluted) screenplay by The Wachowksis, and makes up slick, cutthroat thrill ride; but not without a few occasional flaws in the mix. Though the story offers plenty of surprises, it tends to cram way more ideas than the average viewer can swallow, particularly when the political atmosphere plays a major role in the plot. On the bright side, it also makes for a captivating experience. The film is set in the not-so-distant future in Great Britain, a country dominated by a fascist government under the head of the Norsefire Party, following the destruction of the United States from a civil war and viral pandemic from a disease known as St. Mary. Sporting a wig and a mask resembling the notorious Guy Fawkes, anarchist freedom fighter under the name V (played by Hugo Weaving) chooses to rebel against the government by posing as a vigilante and fighting against the ones who support the fascist government. Accompanied by television network employee Avery Hammond (played by Natalie Portman), V forms launches a resistance to bring down the government while avoiding oppressors appointed by political inspector Finch (played by Stephen Rea) who wants him dead.Unlike most comic-book translations, this film is no superhero flick, nor does it have the feel of one. Instead, it offers something new and almost entirely inspiring to the table. Director James McTeigue accomplishes this by taking it's comic-book style action and characters, and blending these with a wide plethora of political elements and satire. Placing ideas of fascism, anarchism, and libertarianism in the mix, the movie puts political corruption in the front lines of the plot. The city of London in which the story is set is ruled by a government who blame individuals political rebels, illegal immigrants, homosexuals, and Muslims for the tyranny that plagues their society, and deal with the dilemma by imprisoning these specific groups of individuals in concentration camps, thus ridding the society of their freedom. The titular character V responds to these practices by rebelling, and does so with violence as means of Justice. As a result, the character is portrayed not as a hero nor a villain but a figure who does what he believes is right -- basically an antihero in some degree. The plot makes great use of these political elements, but at times struggles to evenly balance the narrative and the political atmosphere. The movie more often than not tries to cram so many ideas into the story that it makes for a significantly complex journey. On the bridge side, director James McTeigue does a great job at not only keeping things moving but executing them in a way that is arresting rather than heavy-handed. By the end, there's never a moment that feels wasted.In the midst of it's flaws, the V for Vendetta prevails at both a visual and acting department. Presenting a likable cast, the film provides audience with some of the most compelling performances ever put on screen in a comic-book flick. Hugo Weaving, veteran of 'The Matrix' franchise (written and directed by The Wachowskis) provides a charismatic vibe as V, the lead character who seeks justice against the totalitarian-like government. Natalie Portman, fresh out of the second 'Star Wars' trilogy', gives a blissful performance as V's accomplice and eventually love interest; easily one of the most memorable performances she's demonstrated in her career. Stephen Rea is also quite credible as the primary antagonist, a man who roots for tyrannical society through means of political corruption. His character is masterfully written with stunning complexity and fascination. These characters all function consistently well in a world embraced by engrossing visuals. The production design of futuristic London is beautiful to look at, and fits suitably for the story. The fighting sequences however, offer the best gem in the visual department, featuring bloody, stylized action with occasional bullet-time shots Matrix style. While the fighting remains mostly infrequent as the story dwells one plot development than action-set pieces, it's truly memorable ewhen it emerges on screen.V for Vendetta is a complex, violent, but explosively entertaining adaption of David Lloyd and Alan Moore's graphic novel, an adaption served with spectacle and intelligence. This movie levels high on the ranks of comic-book action vehicles, and is strongly recommended of all fans of the novel as well as everyone else with a thirst of a compelling dystopian action spectacle.",8,2,4,6 August 2016
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Depression-era comedy sees the Coen brothers in return in one of their most delightful forms
","Since their entrance into the cinematic realm in 1984 when they brought birth to the thriller 'Blood Simple', Joel and Ethan Coen have proved capable of handling just about every genre they have put in front of them. This feat is often accomplished by their ability to bend genres with their sardonic humor, aberrant characters, and narrative twists; all of which is greatly demonstrated in this comedy starring George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro as a trio of hillbillies on a cross-state adventure through the Depression-era Mississippi. Sporting up some unconventional characters, fancy period-appropriate dialogue, and a taste of one of the most lively musical numbers ever brought; this film is just another surprise orchestrated by the Coens, but its a pretty good one to say the least. Set in 1930s, this follows three hillbilly convicts: Everett (played by George Clooney), Pete (played by John Turturro), and Delmar (played by Tim Blake Nelson) who escape from captivity in prison and wander off through the old roads of Mississippi in search of a treasure Everett secretly buried. In the process, they encounter a slew of unexpected figures including Tommy Johnson (played by Chris Thomas King) who sold his soul to the devil to generate his talent as a blue musician, Big Dan (played by John Goodman), a ruthless leader of the Ku Klux Clan, and the law enforcement who sets out to hunt them down.The Coen brothers flourish a handful of surprises for a movie with a title resembling a bible verse (though its confirmed that the title actually derives from a line in a 1941 film 'Sullivan's Travels'). The film is funny, eccentric, and surprisingly heart-filling. The minute our three main characters make their escape, we are introduced to some appropriately quirky characters with eccentric southern dialogue and pop culture references that suites the 1930s period quite well. From there on, the story progresses on these men on some of their most colorful moments including a lively musical number that offers nothing short of charm and fun to listen to. One particular involves a trio encountering three scantily clad women at a pond which leads to shockingly funny end results. Yes, the film does leave a little wiggle room for slightly darker moments which are greatly encountered towards the final act; but the Coen brothers do a genuine job of not escaping their ironically humorous roots. Furthermore, they offer just enough to surprises to make up for a few slogged scenes that don't work well as intended. Regardless, these fine directors know how to keep things moving.When it comes to setting a movie in the Depression-era, it is highly appropriate (though not essential) to go to great lengths to give the film the vintage look and feel of the 1930s. That is where frequent collaborator of the Coens' filmography Roger Deakins and editor Tricia Cooke arrives into the picture. Deakins blesses this beauty with astounding cinematography that is nicely painted with a deep sepia-tone to the film a look of an adventure set in the old Mississippian times. With the use of low saturation and old folk music popular during the Great Depression years, the film effectively fosters an old timely feel of one of America's most unhappy decades. It works pretty conventional, but that's not all. The Coen brothers' have an extremely nifty talent in writing dialogue, and most of it shines through the strong, if a bit eccentric performances by leads George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson; all of whom adopt a thick southern accent that feels authentic, though slightly contrived every now and then. This trio of fine actors make the best of their idiosyncratic characters with their charm and darkly funny persona, and the best part is they do not their opportunities to be bring out some good laughs for granted.O Brother Where Art Thou is a splendid comedic piece that sees Coen brothers in one of their freshest, if not classic forms. It is a delightful film filled with just about everything a moviegoer can expect from filmmakers like the Coens, and even it is doesn't go down as a classic, who can deny the immense memorability this film generates.",8,0,1,21 November 2016
Furious 7," This seventh installment to the Fast and Furious franchise is a pure action thriller ride
","The Fast and Furious franchise had shown its ups and downs throughout since its debut in 2001. This high-octane film series has exhibited a leverage of exhilarating car racing sequences and death- defying stunts that made each of its entries fluctuate in quality of popcorn flicks -- for better or worse. This seventh installment, directed by James Waan, continues its signature sleek action grandeur with some eye-popping car stunts and frenetic action sequences to fuel the adrenaline testatrone, while pushing the plot and character development near the back of the line. This installment, however, faced some major difficulties after franchise veteran star Paul Walker was tragically killed in a car accident during production, delaying the film's release for a whole year. What the cast and crew were not fixing to do however, is not let his death put a halt to the franchise and instead hire Walker's younger brothers substitute the role of Brian O'Connor while being replaced with CGI of Paul's face. The result is a film that not only succeeds with a sleek, action-fueled fare but a surprisingly emotional tribute to the late star. Set after the events of 'Fast Five', Dom (played by Vin Diesel), Brian (played by Paul Walker), and the crew consisting of Letty (played by Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (played by Tyrese Gibson), and Tej (played by Ludicrous) face a new threat, a special forces assassins named Deckward Shaw (played by Jason Statham) who is now seeking vengeance against the crew who took down his brother Owen Shaw in the last film, and sent Agent Luke Hobbs (played by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) to the hospital. Under the assisting eye of Covert Ops agent jokingly named Mr. Nobody (played by Kurt Russell), the crew must pick their slick car racing skills back up and take the down Shaw once for all. When it comes to bathing the action with outrageous car stunts and frenetic firefights, this film certainly delivers. Those who have sat through the previous entries should expect the action to push the boundaries of plausability. In this entry however, the action set pieces soar further into the realm of where the boundaries of logic are pushed to the point where it gets a little absurd. That is definitely not to say that they are a not a whole lot of fun. That is if you are willing to leave your intellect at the door. Ranging from explosive car crashes, to characters driving a car out from a skyscraper into another, to taking a barrel down a cliff, this film exhibits almost no obedience to plausability. Instead, it continues its usual trend of characters zipping through the streets in fancy sports cars and mowing down the baddies in an excess of machine guns. While the plot and character development are unsurprisingly left mostly neglected here, director James Waan thankfully makes up for it with feeding the adrenaline-fueled testosterone with exhilarating action set pieces and infectiously likable characters who never miss the opportunity to spit out some hilarious one-liners from time to time. Jason Statham's antagonist makes for a cheeky villain, but certainly not one that blows the previous ones out of the water. The cast remains funny and charismatic as ever, while Kurt Russell is given little to do other than to deliver some lines of dialogue dealing with techno-business. Easily the biggest gem that the film has to offer is an unexpected emotional heft, uprooted by the death of Paul Walker, that pays off at the end as we are treated with a bittersweet sendoff to both the character and actor.Furious 7 is a wild, fast-paced action thrill ride to embraces the spirit of the franchise with solid versatility, while paying a respectful tribute to the late Paul Walker, a new star shining in the heavens. It is a fun ride for those craving for two-hours of muscle men racing in sports car and dodge bullets. If you are for the ride, fasten your seatbelts.",8,3,9,4 April 2015
