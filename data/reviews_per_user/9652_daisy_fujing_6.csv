Black Swan," It is not really my type as I did not catch what the movie wants to tell me. But I should say it is a good move with a bit thrill.

Ballet and mom is all she has. She is always fragile and weak, carefully not to make any mistake. In fact, she is born the white swan.Life is full of pressure. Because of the force of the black swan and the stress of replacement, she has a little split personality. Fantasying the darker side of herself to be Lily, she turned naughtier. She is nervous and sensitive about the role, making her illness getting worse. She played successfully in the Swan Lake. 'It is perfect', as she said.It is not really my type as I did not catch what the movie wants to tell me. But I should say it is a good move with a bit thrill.",6,1,7,25 December 2010
The Pianist," Life is hard.That's why you have to fight for it.
","The movie's introduction is obviously misleading people. The Nazi officer didn't appear until the last 20 minutes. The whole movie was about a man's story. He was a brilliant pianist and a Polish Jew. He survived in the World War happened in Warsaw. He escaped from one place to another. Anyway, he is alive after all. He first got help from his Jewish friend who is the policeman inside. Then he was assisted by his Poland friends. Some of the friends even raised money in his name while he was dying from jaundice. Afterwards, a Nazi officer offered aid because he plays piano. German withdrawing and he again played piano for Poland radio station which echoed with the beginning. With his eye, I have a deeper understanding how poor the Jewish people in the World War 2. Chinese people are not alone in this war. We also survive. Life is hard.That's why you have to fight for it.",Null,0,0,23 December 2010
Reservoir Dogs," If you want a longer life, stay away from the bank and jewelry store.
","Quentin Tarantino surprised me again.7 guys were causally talking like strangers in the beginning, which makes me a little puzzled. They then suit up like to something big. After the title and the blank, Mr. Orange suddenly got a bloody shot and dying while Mr. White was driving back to the rendezvous. The movie is so intense that you cannot help wondering what happened. You have no choice but to follow Quentin's thought to know what was going on.Violence is everywhere and you have to get used to it. Obviously, Quentin don't want things go as normal. With the reveal of the story, things start going out of control. The ending was surprised but as expected, just as O Henry's novel.Detail is the key. You have no idea when you first watch the movie. Why Mr. Pink doesn't tip? Why there was wired tickets offered over the radio? When you get the end, you will suddenly figure out that Quentin is acting like a strange uncle giving you small candies during the show and saying 'catch it if you can' with a big smile.One minute ago you fancy having a lot of money and go to Los Vegas. Next moment you lie on the ground, dead. Life is full of uncertainty. That might be one of the stuff that Quentin wants to tell us. My suggestion will be if you want a longer life, stay away from the bank and jewelry store.",8,0,1,21 February 2011
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Be careful about our neighbor if the wall is not thick enough
","Guy Ritchie is telling us what a coincidence! Weed was robed and sold back to its seller. Gun was sold and took back to its buyer. Wow! What a coincidence! 4 young men were being trapped in gambling. How to get a mil became a question. It happened to them that their neighbor was planning a robbery and what they do is just wait until they came back. The fact that they got the money is just the beginning of the story. Everybody just wants something back, which makes thing going massy. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels linked everybody.Guy did a good job in telling the story and portraying people. Everyone is vital and related in a funny way. No wonder it is listed No. 172 in IMDb movies. The English they speak is very Britain. Sometimes it will make you laugh. (Like the wild-curl up guy said 'I will kill you.') Does Guy want us to be careful about our neighbor if the wall is not thick enough",9,0,2,21 February 2011
Mary and Max," Long last the friendship
","It is different with animation made by Pixar & Dreamworks or Japanese. So I should honestly say that the people is not so good-looking, which gives the plot a lot of pressure. The movie also reminds me the 'Chicken Run' several years ago.As an animation fan for many years, I am very picky in animation movies. Good ones should either have fantastic picture or surprising story. At the first 1 hour, I seriously think it is boring cause the movie is just telling you that a shy Australia girl and a timid American man writing each other. Although not even talked, they exchanged their confuzzles by letter.I feel emotional touched by the end of the movie. A wall full of letter! Max once said, 'Hopefully, one day our sidewalks will meet and we can share a can of condensed milk.' When the day came, you accidentally go ahead.I think max die happily without regrets by looking back his whole life. He got Mary, his best friend and only friend.When I think back and second thought about the movie, I am astonished to find myself have the same experience. I have been laughed at for something I didn't even remember. I used to be alone walking in the empty playground. However, even if I don't remember why, I still remember the feelings I had at that time. I should say that these incidents changed my life, forced me to change and turned me into a new 'ME'.As time pass by, friends became less and less. God gave us relatives. Thank god we can choose friend. Long last the friendship!",7,3,7,23 December 2010
The Social Network," Maybe that's why he won the victory
","I am facebooking everyday, thus giving me the incentive to watch this film. After watching , I should say it is incredibly interesting for you can go through the life of Facebook and have a brief idea of Mark Zuckerberg. By the way, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake are so cool in this film. Mark is Jewish boy with curly hair. He has superior smart in computer and obsessive enthusiastic in coding. Why he invented Facebook? Just because he was dumped by his girlfriend. Why he is sued by the twin brothers? Just because he has a better idea than Harvard Network. Why Eduardo no longer be his friend? Just because he did a little revenge to make him get nothing. Finnally , he settled out of the court. With the ticket, he lost the only friend and became the youngest billionaire in the world. When he senses an idea, he will put it into reality. Maybe that's why he won the victory.",9,0,2,23 December 2010
