The Perks of Being a Wallflower," not bad, but
","not so good.the story is like a twice-told tale.there is a shy boy who has trauma. he makes friend with nice people and changes.the only originality of this movie is that the boy has a two trauma.one is sexual accuse. the other is friend's suicide.but this originality is not necessarily a good point.by these traumas the story is made desultory. one trauma was enough. why there's two?but the actors are really good. the whole picture is visually beautiful too. this is made sensitively. so in total it is not bad. not so good, though.",6,1,6,4 November 2012
Skyfall," good
","it was well made as an action movie.i felt that this movie was shot as independent of CG as possible.the actors are moving in reality and they are the main movement object of the screen, not CG.action movies often depend too much on CGi these days.so this movie is valuable.the story line was a little bit simple and stereo-typical like.a geeky operator, revenge of ex-son, death of parents.and it ends in booby traps those like in Home Alone.but it is still really exciting.to begin with, the genre, SPY action, itself is cartoon-like, so it would not be a problem that it is simple and stereo-typical.and James Bond was just so cool, no matter how I make fun of him that the story is childish.",7,1,6,12 November 2012
Pan's Labyrinth," meaning of the first scene
","the first scene left strong impression to me.the movie starts from the image of Ophelia laying on the ground and blood turning to her nose.This image must have important meaning, I thought.so I did a research about it.in the audio commentary of DVD, the director says like this.'through the process of writing, the first part was the most difficult.I kept thinking and then i came up with the image blood turning to nose.and I sort of understand that this is how a girl gives birth to herself in the way she wanted to be.' so that's that.This is a dark fantasy movie, but taking it into consideration that most of the movie was a girl's imagination, affected by serious situation she is surrounded, it can be said that it is a realistic and sad movie.And off course it is still a great movie, i think.",7,0,1,29 October 2012

Looper," professional work
","Joseph really looks like Bruce.It is not just the achievement of make up artist, but also his ability of imitation.Joseph is really a fantastic actor.Bruce is not had make-up and he did not seem to imitate Joseph in obvious way, but he also seemed to try to imitate Joseph a little bit.In the scene Bruce holds a wife in the bed, smiling to her, I thought he incredibly looked like Josph. His way of smiling is a little bit more naive than he usually does in other movies and that was just the same smile as that of Joseph.The story itself is so so to me. It was really exciting first, but after Joseph arrived at the firm, it gradually got boring.Still, the idea was new and interesting. and as I said above, acting and make-up were amazing.So, in total it was good.",7,0,2,30 October 2012
Cloud Atlas," moving
","It apparently look complex.There are six stories parallel going, but they are not contemporary.They all are things happens at different time and different place.They are visibly different, so you do not get confused.The only factor they have in common is that all are story about life.And they have alight links with another.That link makes you feel that each of them is a part of one huge story, and we are part of it, too The song, Cloud atlas sextet was so beautiful.All the actors played really good.",8,4,8,10 November 2012
