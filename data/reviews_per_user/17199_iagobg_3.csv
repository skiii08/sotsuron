The Ring," It Was Okay
","I've read a lot of reviews for this movie, most of them either loving it or hating it. I find myself in a position of liking it but not being overwhelmed by it.I won't go on about the storyline specifics. I thought that the story was very interesting, held a lot of great detail for the backstory and I didn't find myself wanting for additional detail. I think the movie sewed itself up very nicely and that nothing else was required.The acting was acceptable, it didn't particularly stand out.The actual film itself was not terribly frightening. The scariest parts were when my wife dug her nails in to my arm (she's easier to frighten than I am, apparently). Probably the creepiest part for me in the whole film was when Samara actually came out of the television screen to kill Noah. That was extremely cool. Other then that, it was wanting for any real chills or thrills. I spent most of the film calmly sipping my soda.I will say that it was better than I expected but not as good as I could have hoped. Still, my expectations for horror films have been at at an all time low for the last couple of years so that's not saying much.Overall, I give it a 7/10. I encourage you to see it, enjoy it for what it is but don't expect it to scare the pants off you.",7,0,0,4 November 2002
Resident Evil," Loved this film
","This movie was amazing. I sincerely enjoyed it from shocking beginning to the horrific ending.It was extremely suspenseful, disturbing and interesting all at the same time. There was the appropriate amount of gore and 'boo' scares in the film. The acting was as good as could be expected.I heartly endorse anyone who likes a good scare and a raunchy bit of gore to watch this film. Two thumbs and two big toes up!",10,0,0,1 August 2002
Signs," Wow
","This movie was absolutely amazing. I felt that M. Night make it a point to stay true to his skill as shown in Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.The story of Mel Gibson's character and his search for his faith. It was done against the backdrop of an alien invasion of Earth but as always with his films, the supernatural portion of the plot is merely the tool for the character's search inside himself.I was riveted through the entire movie. My heart was thundering in my chest. I could not believe the level of intensity that this movie provided. I think he out did himself and I think you owe it to yourself to see this movie. Especially if you enjoyed his other two movies. I can't wait to see his next project!",10,1,2,5 August 2002
