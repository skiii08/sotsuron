Skyfall," Refreshing yet nostalgic...Bond returns
","A fantastic addition to the Bond franchise, Skyfall combines fresh storytelling and some classic bond moments to create one of the best Bond films to date. The villain, Silva, will surely become one of Bonds more memorable enemies and the action set pieces themselves are impressive yet somewhat understated compared to previous films. However the star of Skyfall is not Daniel Craig but Judi Dench, who has more to do in this film than in her previous six outings as the British Bulldog that is 'M'. And it is that word 'British' which really defines this particular film, as much of the story takes place back home, which has often been missing from other films in the franchise. Some may miss the exotic locations but visits to Istanbul and Shanghai in the first hour of the film is enough to satisfy these needs.Overall this is a very solid bond film with much more character development providing a more mature and rich story. Many have suggested strong Nolan/Dark Knight links which are sound observations, but this is still a Bond film through and through and Bond fans will enjoy the nods to previous films which occur throughout Skyfall. Thoroughly enjoyable.",9,1,13,1 November 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," A stunning addition to motion capture feature films.
","Spielberg is not only a film director he is a film GOD! The films this man has created down the years have become instant classics and films which are dear in many peoples hearts. His latest project Tin Tin, is a true Spielberg movie in almost every sense of the word. If you are looking for a fun and exciting adventure story with excellent chase scenes and comical one liners with a tongue in cheek approach to the genre then you are in for a treat.The motion capture is far superior to the likes of Polar Express or Christmas Carol and the characters are much more believable as people.Go and see this for 107 minutes of pure unashamed family fun! Well done Steven, looking forward to War Horse",8,4,10,28 October 2011
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A very good film, but no masterpiece.
","Before going to see this movie, my expectations where high. I am a huge fan of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett and Fincher's C.V is highly admirable. However there is something missing in this film that prevents it from entering the dizzy heights masterpieces. There is no denying that I enjoyed the film a lot, as the plot was interesting and deeply moving at times, and the effects to make Pitt look old and then young are unbelievable. But as I said before there is something lacking in the complete package, where as a film like Forrest Gump, I feel was as good as that film good be. It is common to mention the two films in the same breath and for me Forrest Gump was the more accomplished piece. I couldn't help but leave the cinema thinking that it could have given the audience more, not much more, but that cherry on the top that truly makes movies stand out. I highly recommend this film based on its terrific story and great effects, however don't set the bar too high, which was perhaps my mistake.",8,2,5,20 February 2009
