Walk the Line," Reese Witherspoon is a revelation
","A lot has been written about Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Johnny Cash but it is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter who gives this movie its heart and soul. Phoenix is wonderful showing Cash as he grows on stage and finds a comfort with his voice; however it is only in his duets with Witherspoon that the sparks really fly. Witherspoon lit up the screen in Legally Blonde but after such dogs as Legally Blonde 2 and Sweet Home Alabama I was unprepared for the way she could carry the emotional weight here. While Phoenix's voice was always on the edge of musicality, Witherspoon's always hit the right notes and tone. She deserves an Oscar nomination for her portrayal! Overall, Walk the Line is well crafted with a particularly pleasing inclusions of subtle scenes that make their way back into songs or later plot lines. Phoenix captures Cash's intensity on stage and his misery when apart from Carter very well though he is somewhat less effective in capturing other aspects of Cash's motivations. The core story of Cash's relationship with Carter is extremely well done. Although the film-making avoids some of the clichéd Hollywood touches that showed up in Ray, the story line is lacking in the complexity of Ray and thus yields a somewhat weaker film overall. Abstractly, I would say that the film could have benefited from some tighter editing to cut about 15 minutes from its running time, but I wouldn't want to cut one minute of Reese Witherspoon's screen time!",7,0,2,26 November 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A well-made, well-acted history lesson
","The fact that Good Night and Good Luck is going to be a history lesson, heavy on the word 'lesson', is evident in the first few minutes with the extensive caption setting the context of Joseph McCarthy and HUAC. This is a history lesson that is exceedingly timely and well made and it has drawn extensive praise for both of these qualities. However, it concentrates so much on being faithful to the history, including details of television production in Murrow's day (fascinating as they are), that this history lesson does not make for great drama. Murrow's knock-out blow on McCarthy is a counter-punch but it is so total, unanticipated and without build-up that much of the drama is lost. While viewers can briefly cheer the triumph of his few lines of rebuttal that do the trick, their emotional impact is not sufficient to carry the denouement as Murrow's brand of high quality journalism is moved out of prime time. As a result the denouement does not produce the sense of loss that it might. David Strathairn is outstanding as Edward R. Murrow. As one might expect, he perfectly captures Murrow's intonation, mannerisms, and familiar hard-hitting journalistic style, but Strathairn also subtly and eloquently communicates how Murrow squirms while doing his obligatory celebrity interviews, or is affected by his protégé's suicide. Frank Langella is also excellent in showing the two sides of CBS head William Paley, both the broadcaster willing to go out on a limb and the CEO whose decisions are dominated by the bottom line. (It is interesting to think that CBS also led the resurgence in prime-time journalism with '60 Minutes' more than a decade later.) George Clooney as Murrow's producer Fred Friendly adds little; he seems better behind the camera. Robert Downey Jr and Patricia Clarkson as secretly married staffers on Murrow's show are very good, though their subplot seems put in place solely for the history lesson since they disappear as soon as we learn how the 1950's work rules affected married couples.The script feels somewhat thin and is stretched by frequent interludes with a jazz singer (Dianne Reeves who is excellent) and repetition of footage that we see twice, once as the staff is previewing it and again as the show airs. There is a certain sense of smugness in the point of view. We know that right (not the right, of course) will triumph and it seems inevitable. We can also be smug with our knowledge of the future of commercial television (while we of course watch Frontline on PBS). That seems right: Good Night and Good Luck is like a superbly acted Frontline episode without the usual narration.",7,4,6,19 January 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Best of the HP movies so far
","The Goblet of Fire was the worst of the Harry Potter books but it has been made into the Best of the Harry Potter movies by a large margin. Maybe the simplicity of the underlying story in the book (despite the book's inordinate length) has made the transition to screen easier.The movie has an excellent balance of special effects and character development. For the first time Daniel Radcliffe actually shows he can act the part and the other characters are all on the right notes both teen and adult alike (Mad-eye Moody and Rita Skeeter are perfect).This is the only one of the HP movies that I would be happy to see again. HP 3 (Prisoner of Azkaban) did have the right tone (particularly with Lupin and the Dementors) but Radcliffe still couldn't act and the difficult final scene was far from satisfying. HP 2 (Chamber of Secrets) was a loud mess of special effects that had me and my kids fidgeting with boredom with about 30 minutes still to go (although Dobby was well done and Kenneth Branagh was good as Gilderoy Lockhart). HP 1 (Sorcerer's Stone) got some things seriously wrong in addition to Radcliffe's weak acting, most noticeably a lack of whimsy and a far too sinister take on Harry's first encounters with wizarding at Hogwarts; John Williams soundtrack was particular inappropriate and overblown in those scenes. Richard Harris seemed far too weak as Dumbledore, too, even in HP 1. (Maybe it was his health.) I have much preferred Michael Gambon who projects more of the strength of the character although I did find his consonants a little non-British and almost Americanized in HP 4. (Is it his Irish origins showing?)",8,1,2,21 November 2005
