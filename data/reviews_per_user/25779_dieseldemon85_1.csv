Vertigo," This one is over rated
","I've read about how great a film this was. It was on CFTV tonight. I can honestly say I don't know what all the hype is about. I do enjoy classic films, and have started watching some of Hitchcock's work. I enjoyed Psycho, Rear window, North by Northwest, The Birds. If this were on again I'd give it a pass. I found it over long, dull. The idea of the story was intriguing, but focused too much on the romance, and less on the thriller aspect,so didn't hold my attention. I liked Jimmy Stewart in Rear window, and his acting is good in this one too, though he is lacking in the bravado of a detective type. I could picture Bogart, Cobb, Garner better suited.",5,0,0,11 May 2020
