Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," mostly good!
","The effects and sound were of course stunning, and the acting was much better than the critics made it out to be. It was well worth the price of admission, and I'm going again ASAP!I actually liked Jar Jar, which I hear most people did not.Couple of negatives tho. . . The beginning of the movie did not at all feel like Star Wars.  It didn't really start feeling like Star Wars until they got to Tatooine. Before that, it felt more like a cross between Star Trek and Babylon 5. This isn't necessarilly a bad thing, but it's not good either.  Jake Lloyd is a cute kid in a very big role, but he simply couldn't pull it off.  I'm sorry, but I think if I were flying a fighter ship into the hangar bay of an enemy capital ship, my shields were down, and I was surrounded by dozens of angry robots pointing large guns at me, and my shields finally came back online, I don't think my reaction would be a calm 'oh good there they are.'   Also, and this isn't Jake's fault, I would not say 'yipee' all the time!  Shades of Leave it to Beaver!Aside from the fact that Jake was thoroughly unconvincing, the movie was excellent, and a must-see for everyone!",Null,0,0,21 May 1999
