Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," lame drudge
","Wow, I don't even know where to start. This is probably the only movie I have ever given a 1, because it was truly horrible in every aspect.The Phantom Menace has a plot that, uhm, well is there a plot? The 'Trade Federation' blocks traffic to and from a planet in the hope of forcing the planet's leader to sign some paper. Where's the excitement in that? What happened to saving the universe and action, as in parts 4-6?
Secondly, the characters. Whoever did the casting for this movie deserves to never be given another job in Hollywood. Anakin is an irritating little boy, Natalie is supposed to portray some powerful and wise queen (mind you she's 15 years old!) and who on earth would cast Samuel Jackson as a jedi? Riiiight! When I see him, I don't see a jedi, I see an irritating actor from other movies who has NO place here! Same goes for Liam Neeson. Hollywood, get this through your head, DO NOT cast people like that in parts like this.Furthermore, the parts given to the characters are pathetic. What we see here is a 15 year old girl who is supposedly all big and bad, telling everyone what to do. She not only runs the planet as queen and president, but she is also an accomplished general and trained in fighting, tactics and scaling off the walls of buildings. Riiiight... And then there's Anakin, a 7 year old who happens to be launched into space in a spaceship for the first time alone near the end of the movie. And he blows up the blockade by himself! There are dozens of experienced pilots trying the same and failing, but somehow this little 7 year old, who has no combat experience or no piloting skills, succeeds! Please, don't insult my intelligence, this just turns my stomach.Then there's the fact that the whole movie seems to be written for 10 year olds. That irritating and pathetic Jar Jar, the heroic child and teen queen, the dialogues which are an insult to my intelligence. Add this to the CGI effects that look like, well, CGI effects, and the whole is just some junk kid movie. I've seen 30 year old scifi movies that had better effects (and I won't even mention plots). Don't people realize that CGI just looks fake? Use models! Claymation!Anyway I can go on like this, but the point is that this is a childish movie with bad special effects, miscasting, and an insult to anyone's intelligence. Avoid at ALL costs.",1,2,5,17 May 2002
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," cliché, boring garbage
","So incredibly cliché and boring.Death star? Again? Really? How innovative! Female or black lead character? Wow, how PC! X-wing fighters? Gasp! Terrible CGI for Cristopher Lee's face? Check! Stupid comic relief droids? Bingo! Cliché appearance of Darth Vader, as stereotyped as can be? Yes!Seriously, this drivel passes for a 'good' movie nowadays. 7.9 out of 10. People ranting and raving how awesome it is. People will swallow down anything with the SW name on it. Beyond sad.",5,20,38,19 August 2017
The Hunger Games," shake shake shake shake
","I couldn't decide which was worse: the terrible shaky cam or the laughable, truly pathetic 'love' angle. So I decided to call it a tie.If you want to watch a flick where the lead actress falls in love with a guy just because he says he has a crush on her, implausibly and against all logic, all the while watching it as if your house is being shaken by an 8.0 earthquake, this is the movie for you.For anyone else, avoid this childish piece of self-indulgent 'artsy' camera work at all cost. You'd think by now Hollywood realized that people HATE when the camera angle is changed every second and the cameras are operated by geriatric Parkinson's patients, but apparently their egos won't permit them to get back to normal filming. Or perhaps that would expose just how terrible the acting and action scenes really are... so it's better to hide them behind shaky cam.",5,1,3,21 April 2013
Green Room," Overrated, slow, average thriller
","Yet another disappointment. I'm starting to believe the ratings system can't be relied on anymore. There's just so much junk out there with a relatively high rating of 7 or more, and when you watch it, it's just a total letdown.Take this movie for example. It's billed as a thriller/horror, yet at no moment is it ever scary or gory. The characters are bland and one-dimensional and you don't care if they live or die.The plot is just a joke. In the middle of nowhere in Oregon, there's a bar, where all the yokels, racists and neo-Nazis congregate. What, I guess BLM or Al Qaeda were too busy to take part in the shoot? Or was it just more convenient to make white males the bad guys again, because you know they won't complain, unlike if they were to cast one of the previous two groups... even though white male supremacists commit what, 0.0001% of the violent crime the latter two do? So yeah, once you see who's cast as the 'bad guys,' you know there was no real interest in making a semi-realistic thriller. This is just another hit piece from leftist Hollywood.The movie itself is slow. A band is locked up on a room backstage. Ooooh. Scary! Are you scared yet? No? OK, wait, a handful of neo-Nazis then tries to kill them. OOOOH!! Now you're scared, right? Yeah, I knew it! Yawn.... There are, oh, 7 deaths on both sides, before the laughable ending. Total letdown.The only redeeming value is in the cinematography, as the guys holding a camera and doing the lighting knew how to film in the dark, and they had the wherewithal to not use the shaky cam fad that so many other movies do. Too bad they're dragged down by a stupid story and a snoozefest masquerading as a thriller.",5,5,9,19 November 2017
Doctor Strange," Going through the motions to make Marvel some more $$$
","So this drivel is what passes for a 'good' movie nowadays... sad. I don't remember the last time I saw a great Marvel movie, and this is no exception.Someone apparently thought that making the main character an egotistical, arrogant, obnoxious, stuck-up snob was a good idea. I suppose there's a change of heart somewhere in the movie where (how original! we've never seen that before), to the 'oohs' and 'aahs' of the audience, he realizes the error of his ways and turns into mr. compassionate nice guy, but I missed it. He's a jerk throughout the movie. 0 for 1 so far.The bad guy has the acting skills of a cardboard box. He has about ten lines in the entire movie, which is a good thing as his English is atrocious. So nothing interesting in the villain department either. 0 for 2.Plot then, perhaps? Mmmkay... let's see. Evil bad guy steals pages from the Book of Doom (TM), which oddly enough openly sits in the library of the good guys, because they're gullible fools who blindly trust everyone who enters their monastery, which oddly enough sits in the middle of Nepal yet is populated exclusively by westerners and one or two token Asians. Evil guy wants to then summon the Demon of Doom (TM) who will give him immortality. Good guys have to stop him. Wow! What a breath of fresh air! Sigh. 0 for 3. Actually, if you count the absolutely dreadful and forced romantic relationship, 0 for 4.Finally, SFX? Err... other than some walls folding in on themselves (it appears that's the only spells these guys can cast), a Demon of Doom so bad it almost verges on comedy, and a gate spell that's used every 2 minutes and which looks like a kid waving a sparkle stick, nothing either.Trite, hackneyed junk. No interesting characters and a plot that's a joke - do yourself a favor and read a few old comics instead. Not the junk they put out these days, but something from the 70s or 80s.",4,3,6,11 June 2017
The Lost City of Z," Yawn.
","Another disappointment. This mishmash of a movie doesn't seem to know what it wants. It pretends to be an adventure movie, but more than half of it is spent in England's high society. It pretends to be a thriller, but not for a moment was it riveting or scary. It also wants to be a drama, but not for a second did I care even one iota for one of the characters.The plot is clearly made-up and juiced up for Hollywood. I.e. the hero and his two buddies who have been on his two prior expeditions, are conveniently and magically reunited in the same World War 1 trench (sure, sure, it say they were both transferred to him, but in reality you know the army brass wouldn't give a hoot).The jungle scenes are brief and short and you never really get the idea that they're really out there roughing it. Sure, the movie tries, but it fails. The piranhas and Indian arrows and whatever else seem more of an afterthought that the director threw in there to mark the boxes on his 'checklist of excitement' and it just doesn't work.The hero sure is a moron too, by the way. His 'expeditions' consist of a handful of men, a rickety raft, and they are always short on supplies. He's just asking to fail. Couple this with his ridiculously naive worldview where Indians who wear loincloths and live in mud huts somehow aren't savages, but his 'equal,' and he deserves what's coming to him. One of his quotes is, 'oh look, these people managed to build a field of maize, with mathematical precision' and he practically gushes about how smart and civilized and wonderful they are.... OK, buddy...The movie ends without really knowing what happened to the hero and his kid, but given that they were stupid enough to go into the jungle all by themselves without supplies or support, I'm sure he got what was coming to him.Not gripping, not exciting, just yawn and stupid.",4,1,2,8 December 2017
The Revenant," totally overrated
","Wow, so overrated. Where do I even begin? The cinematograhpry is great. That's about it.The story is simplistic, almost child-like. Throw in some political correctness, silly 'tribal' music, and a litany of deus ex machina implausabilities (apparently being mauled by a bear, starved, parched, thrown from a 70 foot cliff, and immersed in near-freezing water in the heart of winter don't kill a man), and you've got 'the revenant.' Garbage.",5,1,3,29 July 2017
The Patriot," Another self-indulging Gibson movie
","Wow. Just when you thought Mel Gibson couldn't possibly go more over the top than he did in Braveheart, this movie comes along.The entire movie is basically nothing but a pedestal for Gibson to stand upon. Of course he is only portrayed as the hero with only virtues and no vices or flaws, but then again his character has the depth of the story. Simply put: Americans good, British bad. I suppose you have to be an American to like this kind of cheese. Anyway, the entire movie cumulates in a supposedly 'epic' final battle in which the American 'peasants' defeat the British 'elite army'. Anyone who is by now not swept away by patriotism will thoroughly gag, because Gibson single-handedly rallies the American soldiers with a self-indulging display of superman heroism that culminates in his killing of the evil English officer in the cheesiest and most over-the-top way imaginable.Avoid at all cost unless you like to see Gibson playing the super specimen of the male gender, or think the world ends once you leave America's border and the rest of the world is stupid.",2,14,32,31 March 2002
Resident Evil," too much of a videoclip
","This movie had quite some promises in my book, but alas it failed to deliver. **SPOILERS**Horror movies, even bloody action movies, are a rare find these days. Those that do come out are low budget direct-to-video releases and the cinemas are dominated by standard Hollywood fare.Therefor I was excited to hear that a zombie flick was about to hit the movies, but my excitement was short lived.In the first action scene, the music so dominates the picture that I was wondering whether this was a movie, or a videoclip. Sadly enough, this goes on for the entire movie. Whatever happened to atmospheric music that subtly accompanied the picture, the kind where you only realize its importance when you turn it off? Instead of this, we are pleasured with loud rock and rap music.The movie itself could have been much better too. The story is rather flimsy to say the least. (spoiler alert) Most all of the rescue squad dies in the first trap, so there is nobody left to become zombie food. The zombies are slow and drudging, and there is little to be feared from them. Yawn, boring. No excitement, no danger, no threatening monsters. Just slow, walking dead. (end spoiler)Sadly enough, if this is the best horror Hollywood can come up with, they should go back to the standard stuff they churn out.",6,0,1,27 April 2002
X-Men: Apocalypse," Another failed, boring, terrible reboot
","So this is what passes for a 'good' movie nowadays? I'll pass, thanks.Worthless story; bad special effects; teenie bopper heroes; drawn-out, boring scenes in an action movie, inexplicable crap like Jean Gray magically being able to destroy apocalypse by err.. screaming?; more inexplicable crap like his henchmen suddenly turning into good guys; boring 'must do' stuff like adding Wolverine for 2 minutes to be 'cool'; etc, etc, etc.Unbelievably bad. Utter garbage.",3,2,4,21 May 2017
Hidden Figures," Make-believe SJW propaganda
","I'm sorry, this movie just can't be taken serious. While I don't mean to downplay the role that black women had in the space program - I'm sure they were there, and I won't pretend they weren't - this movie is so obviously an attempt to over-portray their role, that is just can't be taken seriously.Let's not equate doing 'basic' (as in repetitive but consuming huge amounts of time) calculations with 'putting a man in space.' But that's what this movie does - somehow, these women know the answer to pressing questions, can magically fix computers when dozens of silly white nerd scientists are just standing around scratching their heads, and so forth.It's so obviously a SJW feel-good-fest that it really accomplishes the opposite of what it probably wanted. You can't take this serious and whatever role these women did in fact play, is just waved off with a shrug of the shoulders. Awful movie that just makes you cringe.",1,62,119,13 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Unbeliavably stupid, politically correct, dumb, predictable, and boring.
","Awful, stupid, dumb.This is what you get when you let SJWs 'create' movies. With create, I mean of course 'copy and destroy' because that movement doesn't create anything - it merely corrupts, steals, and sucks the life out of everything until there's nothing left. As happened to the Star Wars universe.The entire movie seems a metaphor for fighting evil white men.All the First Order are white males.
The rebels are all hip, young women, older women with pink hair, and minorities.I kid you not.Of course, the First Order are absolutely incompetent:
<ul><li>They jump out of hyperspace right over a rebel base, and sit there until one lone fighter come and destroys their one and only 'DREADNOUGHT' (ooh, queue evil music). Clearly, they've never hear of supporting and escort ships. I mean, the US Navy deploys carriers by themselves too right, and those carriers operate without multiple waves of different aircraft buzzing around to defend it? </li><li>They jump out of hyperspace to follow the only rebel ship left, and again... just sit there.</li><li>To make things even worse, they can track someone through hyperspace, but then they are too dumb to notice two dozen transport vessels detaching from the rebel ship and heading to a planet. Really?!</li><li>When the rebel ship is being pursued for ~10 hours, the hipsters can launch a tiny vessel to a casino planet, find a super duper 'codebreaker' (who's not there, but of course they find another one - they are after all cool beyond belief), and fly back to save the day - those stupid First Order chumps just sat there twiddling their fingers all those hours.</li></ul>But then again, what else would you expect from stupid white males, the source of all evil, the scourge of not just earth but intergalactic society?The rebellion on the other hand, they are COOL! They consist of purple haired women in dresses (yeah, the 'admiral' is your average vegan, pink haired skinny tofu eating Antifa supporter... I'm sure these people would do real well in a real war), young hipsters, minorities, and is of course all-inclusive and diverse. They rock. They kick everyone's butt. They can do no wrong. They don't need training - training is bigoted, they just have the magical ability to do things right because they fight for the right cause! The cause is never explained... was there a plot to this movie?! But that doesn't matter, the good guys fight the bad guys, and the good guys rock and bad guys are incompetent boobs who can't swing a light saber without slicing off their own leg.Add some more stupid stuff like CGI gophers (you'd think they learned how stupid this was this back with Jar Jar), some 'funny' new Ewok types, some totally random 'funny' scenes with Chewbacca, the heroine and the Ewoks",3,6,11,5 July 2018
Saw II," Hollywood smelt money
","Warning: spoilers may be found below.The original Saw was an interesting movie: a low-budget thriller/horror with a very original storyline, a tense atmosphere and no lack of gore either. It was a refreshing oasis in the desert of mindless, stupid Hollwood drivel.Sometime after the in-crowd of real fans discovered the movie, the general public caught on and Saw was a genuine hit. Unfortunately, Hollywood caught on too and smelt money. Sequels! More money! Quick! Make sequels! Alas, what that lead to is the nonsense called Saw 2.Saw 2 is, sad to say, a poor ripoff of the original movie. The premise is milked from original, showing Jigsaw at length and droning on and on about his stupid 'games'. Whereas the original had a puzzling plot, this nonsense throws 6 people in a house full of stupid traps in no way scary or interesting in an attempt to lure moviegoers into the theater with the tagline '6 x the terror.' Well, it failed miserably. Poor acting, an uninspired, boring plot, poor gore and did I mention that STUPID editing? What is this, some MTV movieclip? I really don't need to see one scene repeated 5x from different angles, nor do I need to see shots made by a cameraman with Parkinson's disease.Avoid at all costs.",2,4,7,29 May 2006
Wonder Woman," Stupid, inane, stereotypical garbage
","Yawn. Another superhero movie. I don't know why I bothered - maybe because it wasn't a Marvel movie (generic, dime-a-dozen crap)? Because of the lavish praises? Because I was bored?Regardless, it was yet another disappointment. Where to begin?1. Action scenes with requisite slow-motion triple flips... zzzzzz.
2. Cardboard evil bad guys. Oooh, so evil. They even have a scar on their face!
3. Good guy picks up his team of crack specialists from the drunks in the local bar. Wow, ever seen that before!
4. The island of Amazons have the token, laughable, out-of-place black Amazons for the sake of diversity. It's almost as if we're seeing Lake-Town in the Hobbit!
5. Wonder woman can just block the bullets from a hundred rifles and machine guns with her bracers. Errr... okay.
6. Giiiiirrrl power! Men are stupid doofuses. War-mongering, blathering fools. The world would be much better off with women in charge. Enough already with the preaching in movies, ok?
7. Stupid dumb men in the cryptography division are too dumb to recognize Ottoman. But of course Wonder Woman can read it!
8. Sooo, these Amazons live on an island with a magic screen around it. Said screen is what, 300 yards offshore? Why do they have a boat?
9. Just how long was that cringe-worthy 'funny moment' chat in the boat? Ten minutes? Good grief. Editor? Hello? Editor?
10. Hey, you know, sailing from the Mediterranean to London can be done in one night. While you both sleep. With zero sailing or navigational skills. The little ship will just sail itself!
11. Who cares. This movie blows chunks.",4,1,6,24 October 2018
Spectre," bland, by the book, predictable
","<ul><li>Bond only travels first class. Every boat, train, car, plane he's in is of unimaginable luxury. Even a train in Algiers to the middle of the desert isn't full of sweaty goatherders, but it's an immaculate wagon with first-class dining facilities and butlers.</li><li>Every street Bond drives on, is completely empty.</li><li>Bond only drives on streets alongside fancy, palatial mansions, palaces, and impressive bridges and architecture.</li><li>Bond and whatever woman he's with always carry or purchase a smoking and gala dress, even when they rush from one country to another, are pursued, are carrying nothing but the shirt on their backs, or go to attack someone.</li><li>Bond meets woman. Bond sleeps with woman 5 minutes later (even if he meets her at the funeral of her husband... really?!).</li><li>Bond shoot a pistol at a pipeline in an IT facility. Entire facility blows up 10 seconds later.</li><li>Helicopter with Evil Overlord flies away. It conveniently follows the river, so Bond can follow by boat and shoot the helicopter down (again, with a pistol).</li><li>Bond can fly a plane.</li><li>Bond has the latest gadgets.</li><li>Bond can a drill bit penetrate his skull and brain, and not suffer any adverse effects.</li><li>Evil Overlord survives the explosion that destroys his entire base.</li><li>Every computer system can be hacked by Q in the span of 30 minutes.</li></ul>The only redeeming thing about this movie is the cinematography. Most shots are sweeping, wide, and beautiful. The camera doesn't jump from one shot to another twice in the span of a second. There's no shaky cam. The opening shot is a single take that lasts about 5 minutes, from the streets below, to inside the hotel, to on the rooftop - very nice indeed. If only the rest of the movie was half as good.The first 30 minutes had promise. Then it crashed and burned. Don't waste your time.",4,3,8,11 February 2018
Donnie Darko," Booooooring.
","I tried getting through this. Twice. I failed both times, turning it off in boredom on attempt 1. As a big fan of sci-fi, with this movie ranking highly in that category in so many lists, I tried a second time and ended up falling asleep. There won't be a third try.I made it about an hour in, and all I saw was some annoying kid who's on pills, with a dysfunctional family, rebelling in school. He doesn't fit in well at home nor with his 'friends' at school. He's seeing a shrink, because every once in a while he'll see a man in a giant rabbit suit.There's no sci-fi. There's no thriller. There's no likable character. There's no horror or fantasy. It's just a boring story of how this kid spends his days at home and at school.Who knows. After that hour it may turn into the best movie ever. I guess I'll never know. Hey directors: you may want to offer something, ANYTHING, to keep your audience engaged for the first 60 minutes.Avoid at all cost. Boring and stupid.",4,7,13,4 December 2017
