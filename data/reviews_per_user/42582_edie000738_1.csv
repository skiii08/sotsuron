Casablanca," What can you say about an American Classic that hasn't already been said?
","What can you say about an American film classic like Casablanca that hasn't already been said? I'm not sure, but as one of my favorite films, I'll give it a try. Most of the film Casablanca takes place in Rick's Café Americain – a nightclub in the Moroccan city of Casablanca that lends itself to people looking for a way to escape the Nazis; these can include refugees, gamblers, even crooks. Rick's is owned by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Rick has gone to Casablanca to escape the Nazi's, a lost love and 'sticks his neck out for no one.' The plot centers on some letters of transit that have been given to Rick for safe keeping. The letters will allow the bearer to escape to the United States, and freedom. Unknown to Rick is that these papers are the reason that his lost love Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband Victor (Paul Henreid) find their way into Rick's nightclub. Rick is torn between using the papers for him to get out of Casablanca and take Ilsa with him, or give the papers to the couple, so that they can escape the Nazis. Also central to the story line is the song As Time Goes By, a song that was special to Ilsa and Rick during their romance in Paris. Rick has forbid Sam (Dooley Wilson) his piano player to play the song since Ilsa left him alone at the train station in Paris. When Ilsa and Victor come into the club, Ilsa convinces Sam to 'Play It Again Sam, Play It Again.' When Rick hears it, he is furious, until he sees who requested the song. Thus begins the revival of Rick and Ilsa's love affair. Even though by today's standards the scenery and special effects are outdated and at times seem corny, it doesn't detract from the charm, romance, mystery and allure of the story of the film. The lighting and camera angles used to shoot the film contribute to the mystery and allure of the city of Casablanca as well. This can specifically be seen in the lighting and camera angles used for the close-ups of Ilsa. The soft, diffused lighting on her face, gives her an almost angelic quality. The emotions are so evident in her expressions, especially her eyes. While watching this film, the lighting used, reminded me of another of Ingrid Bergman's later films, The Bells of St. Mary's. The lighting used seemed to be similar, and in The Bells of St. Mary's, Ms. Bergman played a nun, so she was angelic in a way. I found that the film Casablanca still held the same allure, mystery and romantic adventure after viewing it for the 20th time as it held the first time.",10,2,3,2 August 2010
