Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pretty bad, and that's on a good day
","I will keep this short as I am sure there have been heaps of comments so I will break into things I did and didn't like about the film.Things I likedIt was good to see some full Jedi in action not just a half trained Luke SkywalkerDarth Maul was cool but criminally underusedThe light sabre duel at the end was awsome, however I do have a problem about the two Jedi ganging up on Maul it does not seem very nobleThe planet effects were breath takingThings I didn,t likeWooden actors no emotion at allPoor storySpecial effects should be reserved for planet shots and space shots.They simply do not work on characters.Jar Jar and co looked like cartoon characters with no depth or weight to them at all.Jar Jar Binks, say no more he sucks big timeI also discovered having read many comments from others on this page that many who liked this film were very offensive to those who did not,saying that they were not true Star Wars fans or did not get it. I am a long time Star Wars fan but I am not willing to say that anything George Lucas cranks out is the best thing since sliced bread. To wrap up on the whole most people liked the first three films, but with this one a great deal did, a great deal didn't, and some were indifferent and that I thinks tells the whole story.",3,0,1,5 September 1999
The Patriot," Come on yanks give it a rest
",Oh dear those Americans are at it again showing themselves as great and good heroes while the rest of the world are evil bad guys. Like my fellow Australians I have a pretty laid back outlook on life and we look upon our American cousins with a mixture of mirth and curiosity.We don't quite understand why Americans need to be constantly patting themselves on the back and heaping lots of self congratulations on each other. Perhaps its ego or maby their just a bit unsure under all the huff and puff.The Patriot was American tripe at its worst. The poor downtrodden but true of heart Americans winning the war on Indipendence against the evil Brits. I think if I had to look at one more close up of Mels perfect family or one more slow motion scene on the then American flag being fluttered across the screen I would puke. Plus let's not forget how those pure of heart downtrodden heroes set about exterminating a few million native Americans a litter later down the track.It seems that what history America actually does not have it either makes up or steals from others. U571 and Saving Private Ryan are great examples of America either winning world war 2 single handed ( hey what about the rest of us ) or taking the credit for others accomplishments ( the evil Brits actuall got hold of and broke the German code while you guys were still sitting at home )Still truth and justice is the American way-----right ???,3,2,5,30 July 2000
