The Longest Yard," this is a great movie. not perfect, but close
","This is an awesome movie. I have always loved Adam Sandler's work (except Spanglish). I never saw but a piece of the original, but I'm sure it is even better than this remake. This had me rolling in the floor laughing the first time I saw it, and I laughed almost as hard the second time. Chris Rock and Adam Sandler work well together. They should do more movies together. A pleasant surprise was when Rob Schnyder showed up near the end. I think he's stalking Adam Sandler. O.o This movie is great, no matter what anyone says. There should be more movies as good as this one. Like I said, Chris Rock and Adam Sandler work together well, and should do another movie together. If you liked it, 'GROUP HUG IN THE SHOWER TONIGHT!'",9,0,2,30 September 2005
