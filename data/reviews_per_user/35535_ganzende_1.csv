","I've never seen a worse movie than this one. If this movie is based on facts, then I'd really like to know what happened to that plane. I've seen news coverage showing the crash site of this flight, but there were no parts of the plane or any bodies to be seen. When a plane crashes it leaves wreckage, and bodies lying around and there were none to be seen in the images shown on CNN, NBC and other major stations. Cellphone calls out of an airliner? Wasn't possible at that time... This whole movie is just another bunch of crap your government is feeding you, they've even got Hollywood helping them covering up what really happened that day! You people should all watch movies like LOOSE CHANGE, IN PLANE SITE etc. etc. Those movies present hard facts, and not twisted dramatized bullshit like this one does! If it wasn't such a sad, bad and even sick thing, this movie and what it stands for, I would really laugh about it... FORGET YOUR TWISTED PATRIOTISM AND START SEEKING THE TRUTH< YOU American IDIOTS!!!",Null,2,8,6 June 2006
