Blade Runner 2049," The Year is 2049
","Blade Runner 2049 is the 2017 sequel to the cult 1982 original. This stars Ryan Gosling, Jared Leto, Ana De Armas, and Harrison Ford. I have seen the original and consider it among my favorite films. So, having high expectations with a director I trust, how did this fare? Well, I'm glad you asked. 2049 takes place a full 30 years later after the original. Blade Runner officer 'K' is planted on a new case after his findings from his last retirement job, discovering that a replicant had a child decades prior. Along the way, he meets Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) whilst finding answers to not just the case, but also to who he is.2049's characters are surprisingly great and intriguing to see and learn about. K's relationship with Joi really showed how far the possibility of humanity coercing with technology on a personal and sexual manner. Harrison Ford gives one of his best performances i've seen from him in a while. And Jared Leto gives a performance that completely washes away the sins of his Suicide Squad role.I loved this movie. Without Denis Villeneuve directing, I would have been entirely suspicious going in. And it exceeded my already high expectations. The set design and visual effects are the best i've seen in recent memory. This is without a doubt the best movie i've seen all year, let alone theatrically. If you're reading this now, I urge you to go and see it.2049 includes themes of love, technology, humanity, and environmentalism. The tech presented here feels more realistic than most sci-fi movies today such as surprising audio glitches, programs getting put on hold when there's a phone call, and a start-up sound being present no matter the scenario. This film also takes the environment of the first film and makes it even more claustrophobic and crowded, in one brilliant shot making you think the tops of buildings are the ground.It's a shame to see something like this do poorly at the box office. Though now that I think about it, makes it seem more like the original, except this time has garnered huge critical praise and a following already. This is a very adult film as kids should probably put this film on hold. Everyone else should watch it at least once.Overall, I give Blade Runner 2049 a 10/10",10,3,10,12 October 2017
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A Spielberg Classic
","Raiders of The Lost Ark is a 1981 film directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, and John Rhys-Davies. It was distributed by Paramount, being labeled as an Action Adventure film. I have seen the film many times before and would gladly give you my opinions and observations to you. The film is set during the 1930's where professor/archaeologist Indiana Jones (Ford) has almost went away with a valuable golden idol from South America. He then finds out at the Nazis are trying find the biblical 'Ark of the Covenant' and unleash it's power to give their regime an extra edge. It is up to Indiana to find it first with the help of Marion Ravenwood (Allen) and stop the Nazis in their tracks. I liked most of the main characters in Raiders, Harrison definitely steals the spotlight as Indiana in most of the scenes he's in. But the film doesn't make him overpowered or less relatable (which is a good thing). He has to fight off against seemingly impossible odds and strong brutes that give Indie a real challenge. Marion serves as a great companion to him and is more likable than the other two female leads in the next films. I'd even go far as to say the Egyptian Monkey was a good actor. There's a lot to like about this film and the IJ trilogy in general. The cinematography is great, grand, and in-camera. John William's musical score is still memorable to this day. From my point of view, this film is a lot 'ballsier' than most PG-13 films today with people melting and exploding fantastically. My only gripe with Raiders is that Indiana survives death by a pretty big amount, really hindering on my suspension of disbelief. Raiders has a lot of Christian imagery, the 'macguffin' of the film (Ark of The Covenant) is a reference to the Bible. And the attempt to summon it's spirits contains a Jewish ritual. But that's all I can think of in terms of themes and such. The film is just a really great action adventure film. After learning about the film for years, this film was widely known for decades and was a critical and commercial success. Young kids could be traumatized, but that would prevent them watching a great film, heck I've watched Robocop since I was 8. Adults will really like this, teens will also. I actually don't know anybody who doesn't at least appreciates Indiana Jones. No matter what your opinion on the film is, I will respect it. Overall, I give Raiders of The Lost Ark a 9/10",9,0,0,26 September 2017
500 Days of Summer," 500 Nights of Sleeping Material
","500 Days of Summer is a 2009 film directed by Marc Webb and stars Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. The film is distributed by 20th Century Fox under their 'Searchlight' division, being labeled as a Dramatic 'Rom-Com'. I've seen the film yesterday and will give my observations and opinions to you. 500 Days tells the nonlinear tale of Tom's seemingly magical relationship with a girl named Summer. Entangling in Fate, Coincidence, and True Love, their relationship goes through leaps and bounds in terms of events and all goes south. Also, Richard McGonagle plays Morgan Freeman as a narrator. The characters in 500 Days are all hipsters working in an office. I'll give the film credit for giving the two leads chemistry that is very fitting for the film's emotional range. I couldn't exactly get into the Tom (JGL) character since he didn't feel like a good enough audience surrogate, though the narrative structure isn't to blame, maybe it is the writing. And Zooey Deschanel does a good job playing Summer, being an a good and equal counterpart to JGL.500 Days of Summer felt half-and-half for me. I was completely fine with the cinematography as some shots and scenes are well done. But nothing about the film went above & beyond for me which other indie romance films like Punch-Drunk Love and Eternal Sunshine did. Plus this breaks the filmmaking rule of never showing a better film in your own movie, which was The Graduate. As soon as our two characters were watching it, I said 'Yeah, I should be watching that instead.'500 Days has it's feet planted in the themes of Love, Fate, Coincidence, and even Inevitability. Most of them play a part in the end and was disappointed the way it turned out, making the entire movie and concept into a pun. The movie felt to have a more somber mood than it should have since I would have liked it a little more if they had more fun with the script, acting, and tone in general. After doing light research on the film, it certainly has found an audience. Kids will not be into this seeing as the concepts and story might not be understandable to them. People growing into adults will certainly have something to appreciate here. No matter what your opinion is on 500 Days is, I will respect it. Overall, I give 500 Days of Summer a 5/10",5,1,4,28 September 2017
Justice League," The best I've seen from the DCEU
","Justice League is a 2017 film directed by Zack Snyder (and partially Joss Whedon) and stars Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason, Momoa, and Ray Fisher. The film was distributed by Warner Brothers and produced by RatPac. I have seen the film during it's opening weekend and would like to present my thoughts to you.After the death of Superman, Bruce Wayne (Affleck) is alerted of a plan set by Steppenwolf due to his latest encounter with an otherworldly creature. With the help of Diana Prince (Gadot), they help assemble an unlikely team of heroes to help combat his terraforming plan.The League in Justice League wasn't terrible. Affleck has a really good interpretation of Batman in his hands even though he doesn't give it his all here. Gal Gadot is pretty good as Wonder Woman and the same can be said about Momoa's Aquaman character. The ones who didn't quite work for me were Ezra Miller's Flash and Cyborg as either tried to hard to make the film funny (even if some jokes do work) or just feel a little bland and angsty.There was plenty of stuff I liked in JL. It runs at a decent enough pace and never bored me or angered me to the core like this year's Transformers did. And some of the concepts brought up such as Superman being evil for a short period of time and how this film portrays him as well. Though the CGI is very bad for a $300+ Million production as it looks rushed. For example, Cyborg looking like a floating head. The villain Steppenwolf was pretty bad as well and never felt like a legitimate threat once in the entire movie.Justice League has a slight reference to a theme such as Superman being resurrected and how it feels to come back to life even though this film doesn't quite flesh that out. And that's really it.To clarify, I am not a 'fanboy' for either side of Marvel or DC so actual reception to the film can be somewhat difficult to come by so I'll give you this: It is an ok-ish movie. It isn't quite good, but it is not downright terrible. There is some fun time to be had with this movie, so keep that in mind.Overall, I give Justice League a 5/10",5,1,3,20 November 2017
Man of Steel," This steel isn't stainless
","Man of Steel is a 2013 film directed by Zack Snyder and stars Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, and Russell Crowe. The film is distributed by Warner Brothers and produced by Legendary Pictures, being labeled as a Sci-Fi Action Drama. I have seen the film a month before, but I would like to document my observations and opinions to you.Man of Steel tells the origin story of the most popular icons of today: Superman. The film shows us the story of how Kal-El became Clark Kent, and how he becomes the Superman all through a span of thirty three years. Meanwhile, General Zod and his crew try to find Kal-El since the 'Codex' is embedded in his genes, which is believed to make a new Krypton on Earth by means of terraforming and destruction. It is up to Kal-El to find out who he truly is and stop Zod's plan.The 'Characters' in Man of Steel are nothing but vessels for bad screen writing and exposition, and no one has an actual legit conversation as characters expose stuff we already know through visuals that have been established. I will give the film credit for great casting, but you can't turn crap into gold just through that. And Henry Cavill and Michael Shannon are the only cast members that feel like they give their all.This film was not good, and most things that came close to being liked were merely appreciated such as costumes, set design, and concepts. The CGI was not good, I hated the cinematography and the color palette that does not fit the tone of Superman. Even some of the choices that have been made like Superman leaping over a gas truck to blow up an entire parking lot behind him with people in it. This story did not need to be told through the Superman archetype. If I would let anyone direct a reboot, it would be Brad Bird.Man of Steel is filled with themes and questions. One of the questions is 'What would it be like to be responsible for the fate of the world?' Interesting question, but is Superman really the best character/archetype to answer that? This movie could have worked with it's themes and questions, but they should have had fun with it or have a zaniness factor like the previous Superman films. Instead, we got this.After I saw the film, it came to me that MoS is for people that don't appreciate or understand Superman at his core, and there are things about icons that don't change. And with that, Zack Snyder and Co. through those guidelines out of the window. Kids (who Superman was created to appeal to) will not like this movie and I don't think general audiences did either. This film was meant to have divided reception since the beginning. But no matter what your opinion on the film is, I will respect it.Overall, I will give Man of Steel a 4/10",4,1,3,26 September 2017
The Graduate," Seducingly Excellent
","The Graduate is a 1967 film directed by Mike Nichols and stars Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katharine Ross. The film is distributed by Metro Goldwyn Mayer, being labeled as a Dramatic Comedy. I was aware of the film's presence in cinema before watching it. But after watching it, I wanted to document my observations and opinions just for you.The Graduate is the story of Benjamin Braddock (played by Dustin Hoffman) fresh out of College who doesn't know what do with his future other than for life to carry him away. After his Graduation party, he becomes seduced by Mrs. Robinson (played by Anne Bancroft) and they start dating. Ben's father then asks him to date the Robinson's daughter, Elaine (played by Katharine Ross) whom Ben is now attracted to and proceeds to do as such. Ben soon gets caught up in troubling affairs and antics throughout in a world not quite as promising as it seemed. Dustin Hoffman's 'break-out' performance as Ben Braddock is an excellent audience surrogate, being confused, nervous, and trying to keep his cool through the first half of the film. Plus his character development is great and woven into the progressing story perfectly, who runs in complete circles in the game of life. Anne Bancroft's performance as Mrs. Robinson steals every scene she is present. She has almost total dominance throughout entire scenes, being the perfect blend of sexy and dangerous. Katharine Ross delivers a very good performance as Elaine, showing very convincing emotions when needed. Though I think her character is slightly underwritten as I would have liked to see more of her. I liked a lot about The Graduate (well, that's an understatement). Every single shot never ceases to amaze me with it's composition, movement, length, sound design, and more. I also loved the lighting of each scene, serving as both a metaphor and carefully crafted filmmaking. The film is realistically dark seeing as it envelopes Ben in this newly found adult world, giving new meaning to the term 'Dark Comedy'. The Soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel really set the tone and elevate scenes in which it is present. Plus, the songs are enjoyable by themselves, even without context. The Graduate's themes are about adulthood, relationships, and society. Ever since you or anyone turns into an adult, life turns a complete 180 degrees and that can be troublesome for most. But The Graduate makes this turn of events both surreal and grounded, showing this world feeling manufactured and weird, but also with a sense of realism to follow. The lesson I got from the film is that you need to plan things rather than life giving you a rude awakening very quickly.I believe this movie has something for everyone. General audiences can appreciate the depth and the film in general. And people who like cinema outside of watching it will get a surprisingly deep story. And since the film is PG-13, I believe the film is worthy of the rating showing adult themes and even imagery. But I would recommend this movie to anyone mature enough to understand it's themes. I believe this is the same tier of comedy the Coen Brothers and other legendary comedies set decades later.Overall, I give The Graduate a... 9/10",9,1,2,26 September 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," Rise Up
","The Dark Knight Rises is a 2012 film directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Christian Bale, Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy, and a slew of others. The film was released by Warner Brothers, being labeled as a Superhero Action Drama. I've seen the film a total of two times and would like to document my opinions and observations to you. The Dark Knight Rises tells the final tale of Nolan's Trilogy. 8 years after the Joker's reign of terror, Bruce Wayne has retired as Batman and Gotham has been restored to peace, at least on the surface. Bane and his huge army of mercenaries plan to take Gotham under Martial Law with a mobile Nuclear Bomb. It is up to Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle to stop Bane's terror and make Gotham rise from ashes. Rises has a ton of characters, so I'll narrow it down. Christian Bale has a pretty good balance of Bruce and Batman, unlike George Clooney who can only play Bruce Wayne as seen in Batman and Robin. Anne Hathaway as Selina plays a very different version of her character in contrast to Batman Returns, but this movie doesn't utilize her as much as a key character than in that, but she was a completely fine character. I love Tom Hardy's performance as Bane as he steals every scene he is present.I liked a lot about Rises. Some of the choices made in writing and scene continuity felt a little off. Other than that, it was a great film. It isn't all the way up there with the last film, but it is close. It really felt like a grand epic film, utilizing hundreds of extras and large set pieces that make great use of environment. Plus, it gives Batman an interesting arc to end the entire franchise on.The final Dark Knight film delves into themes such as redemption, justice, legacy, and life. Almost the entire build-up of the film is Bruce Wayne coming out of the Hermit's Shell and returning as Gotham's most needed savior at a time of crisis. And at the end of the film, Alfred (Michael Caine) finally sees his vision come true, seeing as Bruce Wayne has made it past being Batman in a non literal sense. And Blake (JGL) is him coming to terms with meeting the Batman and become Robin. The Dark Knight Rises might appeal to Kids in the loosest sense, as in they would care about the action figures more since they are associated with Batman. Film Readers and General Audiences will probably find a lot to enjoy here. After a little research, I found out that it certainly has an audience. No matter what your opinion on the film is, I will respect it.Overall, I give The Dark Knight Rises an... 8/10",8,0,0,26 September 2017
Blade Runner," Knife Jogger
","Blade Runner is a 1982 film directed by Ridley Scott and stars Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, and Brion James. It is based on the Philip K. Dick short story 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'. The film was distributed by Warner Brothers, being labeled as a Sci-Fi Crime Thriller. I have first seen the film over a year ago and will gladly document my opinions and observations for you.Blade Runner is set two years from now when androids are being used in off world colonies as workers. Four of them escape to Los Angeles and band together as an effort to increase their 4-year lifespan. It is up to Deckard (Ford) to investigate their whereabouts and confront them and along the way meet Rachael (Young).Every single character adds a lot to the coldness and darkness in the future world of Los Angeles. It is a serious film, but Roy Batty (Hauer) is both intimidating and charismatic as he always feels like a presence of death in every scene. Almost everyone else for the most part takes their part completely seriously. I love Blade Runner, plain and simple. The original score by Greek composer Vangelis is marvelous and worth listening to on it's own. The Set Design is gorgeous and completely paved the way cyberpunk media should look. The cinematography is also amazing, miniatures look real, and it subtly captures symbolism of scenes along with great dialogue. The themes of Blade Runner include Humanity, Philosophy, Genetics, and the Environment. One of the main forces of the film are testing people to see if they are human or replicant with the 'Voight-Kampff Test'. The effect of knowing is shown through Rachael who begins to cry that all her childhood memories are implants. Batty's speech about 'tears in rain' really brings my emotional side out seeing as it is applicable to humans too and gives the character some redemption as well. Blade Runner didn't find it's audience in it's infancy, but it became the cult classic it is today. A sequel set in 2049 is coming out in October and I can't wait to go see it. Kids should wait and get older to see it to fully appreciate the film. Teens into film and Sci-Fi should love this and so should adults. This film has stood the test of time extremely well. Overall, I give Blade Runner a... 10/10",10,2,4,26 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force Awakens
","The Force Awakens is the Seventh Star Wars film directed by J.J. Abrams and stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and Harrison Ford. The film was mass distributed by the Disney Corporation and produced by Lucasfilm, being labeled as a Sci-Fi Action Adventure. I actually own the film and would be glad to document my opinions and observations just for you. The Force Awakens is set a full generation after the events in Return of the Jedi. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a lonely scavenger selling for scraps for a living on Jakku. On the other side of powers, Finn (John Boyega) is a storm-trooper looking to escape from the First Order with the help of Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Their fates coerce and try to take on the First Order run by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Characters in The Force Awakens are mostly good ones. You can call Rey a 'Mary Sue', but Daisy's performance really makes up for what could be an underwritten character. The movie has a lot of characters and is a lot of fun but they don't balance out easily. Some like Captain Phasma look interesting, but she does next to nothing in terms of plot and character development. But overall, most of the performances are great and give the film a lot of levity, unlike *Cough* Rogue One *Cough*.There was a lot I liked here. There is a lot of grand set pieces that really give the film huge scale. Even the visual effects by ILM looked amazing as well. And overall, The Force Awakens is a huge amount of fun. The plot is a rehash of A New Hope, but as they say 'If it isn't broke, don't fix it', even if there are elements of Empire thrown in. Themes of The Force Awakens include Family, Fate, and Coincidence. Since Rey has the Force, it is only known that she should discover the full extent of her powers, which is implied at the end. Family plays a big role in the Star Wars universe. And this trend continues with Han and Leia's son being the leader of The First Order.This film has reached more than a seventh of the world. It has most certainly found its audiences. General audiences would like this film. Star Wars fans certainly would. Depending on how you see the plot, it could go any way.",7,120,179,26 September 2017
Back to the Future," Back to The Shack
","Back To The Future is a 1985 film directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, and Thomas Wilson. The film was distributed by Universal, being labeled as a Sci-Fi Comedy Adventure. I have seen the film many times before on different formats.The film takes place in 1985, Marty (Fox) is accidentally sent to 1955 by means of a time-traveling DeLorean. Due to the very limited plutonium supply the DeLorean had, he needs to find Doc (Lloyd) to get the DeLorean up and running again. Along the way he meets his own father (Glover) during his high school years. Marty realizes that it is his destiny to unite his Mom & Dad at the 'Enchantment Under The Sea' dance. I love almost every single actor's performance in this. Every single character, no matter how small, gets an arc. For example, Goldie Wilson (Donald Fullilove) is running for his 2nd term as Mayor in 1985. In 1955, Wilson gets the confidence to run as mayor from Marty. Fox's charisma as Marty is unprecedented and is one of the best audience surrogates in all of film history. Lloyd has the performance of a lifetime, stealing every scene he is in. I love BttF, it will always remain as a classic as time goes on. It's representation of time-travel is almost flawless. The characters are amazing as goes with the story and with the writing and direction. The only nitpick I have is that some of the green-screen effects look dated but that's it. Themes of BttF include love, destiny, and coincidence. The main theme song is 'The Power of Love' by Huey Lewis & The News if that doesn't tell you anything. Destiny and Coincidence play a huge part in here seeing as George McFly doesn't get the courage to ask Lorraine out to the dance until Marty enters their lives.This film has reached a lot of people then and certainly has now and will only be more widely known as time goes on. General Audiences love it, Kids love it, and Adults cherish it. The only people who would hate it are hipsters who think there are no great films, only overrated ones. Overall, I give Back to The Future a 10/10",10,0,1,26 September 2017
