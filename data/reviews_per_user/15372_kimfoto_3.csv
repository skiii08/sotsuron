Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A nice, high-priced cartoon.
","Has anyone noticed how LOUD motion pictures have become? Ear-splitting special effects always signify empty Hollywood pot boilers, and this installment is certainly no different. As fantastic an actor as Robert Downey is, I feel that the biggest flaw in this film is the casting. He's so short, so dark, and so grungy that he reminds me of a young Al Pacino in 'Panic in Needle Park' playing the heroin addict. Comparing him to the Sherlock Holmes versions of the past (like the incomparable Basil Rathbone) made me cringe. And paring him with Jude Law only added to the enormous mismatch (that same sex dance scene at the ball made him look like Downey's gay lover -- I can't believe that in Victorian England that this little stunt didn't even raise an eyebrow!! In those times, he would have been sent to prison at hard labor for the rest of his life). Then, all of those life saving measures that 'Doctor' Law administered on Holmes hadn't even been INVENTED for another hundred years!!! Chest compressions with a direct shot of adrenalin into the heart? Not. It reminded me a rewrite of 'ER,' as out of sync as dinosaurs walking down Madison Avenue, a suspension of disbelief that I was simply unable to make. SH2 will certainly make the studio millions, then the inevitable sequel... Sherlock Holmes XVI, anyone?? Better than Prosac.",2,16,40,15 December 2011
The Dirty Dozen," One of my favorite war films of all time.
","This is what I refer to as a 'perfect film.' Perfect casting, perfect screenplay, and perfectly entertaining, the true value of any good film. Unlike many war movies, it was a curious mixture of both drama and broad comedy, but they pulled it off extremely well. I noticed that most people who viewed this film LOVED it, but there were also several who DAMNED it. These few individuals are what I commonly refer to as 'imbeciles,' people who think of themselves as actual movie critics, but with the mental sensibilities of the brain dead. For example, someone who thought it was 'terrible' because it was 'inaccurate and over the top.' Yes, it was. It's a movie, Einstein, not an historical record. Then another genius criticized the film for singling out the 'Christian soldier' (Telly Savalas) as the psychopath as a direct threat against good Christians everywhere. Well, I'm a Christian, and I thought this decision was as valid as any other choice, particularly since there were far more Christian fanatics in the sixties than Muslims or Budddhists, wouldn't you agree? Calling someone a 'Christian soldier' is the ultimate oxymoron, in of itself! Another goofball accused the Jim Brown character as dressing up as a Nazi, further underlining the glaring inaccuracies of some of these wholly negative comments. In conclusion, this film was created solely as entertainment, not to be taken as seriously as films like 'All Quiet On The Western Front' or 'Paths Of Glory. If you don't know the difference, you shouldn't be criticizing movies, period.",10,1,4,21 January 2012
The Happening," Good night, Shymalayan.
","Mr. M should have given up after 'The Sixth Sense.' Watching this poor excuse for a bad TV movie was nearly as tedious as watching Mel Gibson catch an alien (an underpaid extra in a rubber suit) in his kitchen in the colossal turkey, 'Signs.' To expect any intelligent person to believe that plant life should suddenly wage war against homo sapiens after 200 million years is asking me to take a leap of 'willing suspension of disbelief' that no one but an imbecile with the intelligence quotient of, dare I say it - a plant - would be capable of. If you want a great film about nature gone wrong, then catch Hitchcock's 'The Birds.' Or if lower life forms wreaking havoc on mankind is your cup of tea, Michael Crichton's 'The Andromeda Strain.' But how M. Night was even able to raise the capital to make a film of this stultifying dullness is a tribute to his brilliance as a huckster, and producers as the blind purveyors of doom that this film so abundantly supplies.",1,0,1,12 January 2012
