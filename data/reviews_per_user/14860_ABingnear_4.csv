The Hangover," FINALLY!!! An equal to Animal House
","OK for starters I am probably a bit older (53) than the demographic this film was targeting. In spite of my 'advanced' years I found that this film is the funniest 'slob comedy' I have seen since Animal House (the original in the genre). I'd rate it an 8 1/2, but there is no provision in the ratings block for decimals, or fractions. I really don't want to get into the situations the guys find themselves in as there is an 'answer' for everything in the last 40 minutes of the movie. Even the most outrageous things get a 'plausible' explanation, plausible, and undeniably hysterical. All in all a very fun movie.",8,0,0,30 December 2011
The Fast and the Furious," How about the Insipid, and the Brainless???
","My summary is my review, boiled to its essence.  I was bored to tears after about the third chase sequence, I was thinking: 'If all they can do is limn the classic car chase sequences from 'Bullit', why did they bother making this sorry excuse of a movie.  If you like things like a plot, character development, pacing, intelligible dialog, this is definitely NOT the movie for you..",Null,0,1,13 September 2003
Pearl Harbor," Dreck, utter Dreck..
","Anyone that thinks this movie is OK, is either a 14 year old girl or wants to be. I've never seen a WWII epic that was as poorly done, the historical inaccuracies are too many to enumerate. As offensive as the inaccuracies are the 'token' role undertaken by Cuba Gooding Jr, was worse. At least they managed to show Seaman Doris Miller's role in shooting down 2 planes in a mostly true to life fashion, the crud about his boxing was fabricated from whole cloth. It is based on this that I've rated this movie a 2 of 10 and it gets that because the effects were astounding, but not enough to merit anything higher.",2,0,1,9 September 2003
Avatar," Story,Story, Story....
","Apparently Jim Cameron forgot the first rule of movie making 'Tell a good story'. The recipe for this film, can best be described as: Take some 'native American spiritualism/mysticism', add an ounce of effects from Aliens, a dash of Terminator 2, and more than a pinch of the crap love story from Titanic, add a ton of hype, and stir in a gullible audience, mix well, and cook for an interminable 2 hours and 42 minutes. This is apparently how to make the highest grossing film of all time, Cameron needs to be reminded though that highest grossing does not equal BEST. I give this flick a 5 out of ten due to the run time which could easily have told the same story in about 2 hours flat. As has become usual for a Cameron film the music was annoying, and too frigging loud. I could go on but will not bother.",7,2,5,8 November 2010
