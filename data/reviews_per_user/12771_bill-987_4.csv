Requiem for a Dream," Robbery, pure and simple!
","Let's get this one downer out of the way first. That Ellen Burstyn lost the Best Actress Award was a horrible travesty. That she lost it to an above average actress in a marginally average film about an incident of below average interest actually takes a little of the sting out because it demonstrates the political b-s- which is the Academy's voting process. Burstyn delivers the performance of her career as Sara Goldfarb, an older woman whose loneliness drives her to a dependence on diet pills. Had Burstyn won the award I'd probably be complaining about the inadequacy of the honor.I don't believe in the concept of any artwork being 'definitive' of its style or subject matterÂ…but this one comes pretty close. I can't think of any other film about drug addiction which deserves to be in the same conversation with 'Requiem'. It's depressing, horrible, tragic, powerful, and intensely compelling.I really want to avoid including anything which smacks of a 'spoiler' and might lessen the power of the rabbit punch a new viewer will inevitably receive but I can't help returning to Miss Burstyn's performance. My first reaction was to feel for the tragic young lovers Harry and Marion but their plight was really of their own making. Sara just wanted to be popular. She wanted to be on TV and be envied by her friends. She wanted to turn back the clock and fit into her best red dress. I know, I know, the doctor's prescription for amphetamines flies in the face of common sense and gives us a convenient heavy, but it in no way diminishes what Miss Burstyn did with the character.There should be lots of other kudos attached to this film; Jennifer Connelly's delivered her best ever, as has Wayans, Leto, and Darren Aronofsky and Hubert Selby, Jr. put a lot of love into this screenplay. Selby's hands on to the point of living on the set and acting in a minor role.Films are supposed to entertain us. For many of us the surest way to entertain is to evoke strong emotion. If this film can't make you feel, you've 'accidentally discorporated' (Heinlein) and haven't noticed yet. Ten stars!",10,3,6,3 October 2006
Match Point," 8/10 Great film, 100% SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!!!!!
",I really enjoyed this film but the first time I watched it I found myself turning it off in the middle (an almost unheard of act) and completing my evening re watching 'The Duel' (the first tale in the Hornblower miniseries). The following day I reflected on my actions and with much introspection came to the conclusion that the reason I had turned it off at the point I realized the inevitability of the murder was because I was inwardly revolted by what was about to happen. I watched the film through to it's end at 4 AM the next morning and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was not upset that Chris Wilton had gotten away with a double murder. I was not upset that the totally innocent neighbor was killed as 'collateral damage'. I wasn't even upset over the concept of a man using murder to solve a domestic problem (I can think of a number of people whose spouses should be held justified and therefore blameless for their murders).What I discovered was that I had so objectified either Scarlett Johansson or Nola Rice (I'm not sure which) that my mind had rebelled at what it saw as an act of ultimate evil; the wasting of an absolute babe. The act had apparently so horrified me that I ran to one of my icons of purity and goodness; the character of the 17-year-old midshipman Horatio Hornblower.Go figure!,8,1,2,30 December 2006
From Here to Eternity," I Wish the Academy had a category 'worst adaptation form another medium'!
","I've always thought that were it not for the accident of the timing of its birth this film might today be spoken of in the same conversations which feature 'Citizen Kane'. There are some amazing performances in this classic. If this isn't the best work Clift has ever done it certainly ranks right up there with his best and I'd have to say the same thing about Donna Reed and Frank Sinatra. Although I'd have to rank 'The King and I' and 'Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison' slightly above this performance of Deborah Kerr's, I emphasize the word 'Slightly'.I'd probably have to have given this work a solid 10 were it not for the studio's complete mishandling of the property. This was the era of Joe McCarthy so I suppose it's expected that everyone cut Harry Cohn some slack but I have a rough time doing that. James Jones hated this film and while I can't quite share his total contempt, I also didn't have to live through seeing one of my finest works prostituted on the altar of social expediency and misguided right-wing oppression. This was the film which instructed me about the perfidy which occurred at Pearl Harbor. It taught me the difference between being a soldier and fighting a war. I vividly remember seeing this as a pre-teen and being confused as to what the 'New Congress Club' actually was. It wasn't an ordinary night club and it wasn't a brothel. In my ignorance of censorship and general juvenile naivetÃ© I finally concluded it was some sort of takeoff on the 'dime-a-dance' halls in cities of the time. Stupid me! Between sucking up to the Department of the Army and the 1950's censors Jones' work had been reduced to an insipid shadow of the book. At first I thought the studio would have been better off putting the screenplay on a shelf until an atmosphere prevailed which would allow the completion of the work as Jones intended but then we might have missed securing the services of this cast.With the unwavering clarity of hindsight, perhaps it would have been better had the film been faithful to the novel. It wouldn't have been able to be released at the time so, like 'Kane', it would have sat on a studio shelf until a time when it could be properly appreciated.",7,1,4,3 February 2009
V for Vendetta," I assume (with all the attendant baggage that word implies)
","I assume (with all the attendant baggage that word implies), that Natalie Portman's shaved head was the inspiration for Britney's romp with Kevin and shears. Alas, dear Britney but Natalie arising from a sewer with shaved head and a tank top is lovelier than you have ever been with your finest make-up, coif, and designer togs. You just can't get there from where you're starting. Miss Portman also has profound talent; a possession Miss Spears can only dream about. (I'll bet you didn't think it possible to use talent, Portman, and Spears in the same sentence!) 'V' vaults past veritably every previous offering and cinematoonically vests itself as the video version of '1984'. If they had any sense the executive board of the NRA would adopt this film as their own. The greatest reason for an armed citizenry is to protect itself from it's own government. The only difference between Guy Fawkes on the one hand and Nathan Hale and Patrick Henry on the other is that their side won (you've of course noticed how interchangeable the terms 'freedom fighter' and 'terrorist' are in virtually every situation).A rating? A vehemently vocalized '10'!",10,2,5,9 March 2007
