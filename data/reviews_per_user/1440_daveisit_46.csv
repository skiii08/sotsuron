Scarface," Timeless Great
","Whilst a little long, 'Scarface' produced a movie well worth the old perusal. Al Pacino was his regular solid self, and Michelle Pfeiffer fairly ordinary which is to be expected. The degree of violence and swearing in the movie was an indication of the direction these kind of movies were taking as the eighties rolled into the nineties. This is another movie you can't help but admire the wardrobe on. The sheer arrogance of the manner the leads wear their clothes allows them to pull off a look that is laughable, yet amazingly stylish. One must applaud such a show. On top of all this, a well directed and written script allows the audience into what is quite likely an accurate portrayal of the Miami underworld.",8,33,66,18 December 2001
The Longest Yard," Handycam Happiness
","Even though I am yet to see the original I find it highly unlikely this could be a better movie. The name Adam Sandler is possibly unfairly associated with movies involving the same old jokes and big punches and hits. Sandler isn't this one dimensional as movies like 'Punch Drunk Love', and the romcom 'The Wedding Singer' will attest. It bothers me that his comedy's are becoming fairly stagnant. This is fine if you are a huge Sandler fan, but if you are impartial to his work you will be losing interest quickly. Sandler needs to pop up with a few art-house serious roles, and evolve a little more with his own material.The rest of the cast plod along with less than exciting performances. Perhaps my biggest problem was the way violence was deemed to be the resolution to all the problems. This may be the truth in the real world or it may be part of the movies humour, but I found it sickening.I loved the table tennis table and ball.",4,14,30,5 July 2005
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Spielster's Done A Lot Worse.
","The eighties were a period where Spielberg began going through a transformation. By the time the nineties had arrived he had lost the plot due to his ridiculous sized budgets. In 1982 E.T. just managed to escape most of the Spielster's new ways. E.T. was fairly well made and very emotional to the young viewers, and even some of the older viewers. I couldn't describe it as magical, but instead a bit of fun. The references to Star Wars were the highlight for me.This time a 7 out of 10 for the Spielster.",7,7,15,30 November 2000
Casablanca," AWESOME BUT OVERRATED
","'Casablanca' is definitely not the best film of all time. It is actually overrated. It's a nice story, with a good script, has fair acting, and at times is very moving. After all these years it is still enjoyable and captures the audiences attention like all great films do. This is all it is, another great film.8 out of 10",8,16,32,29 November 2000
Fight Club," Very, Very Ordinary
","Well it was a nice story, and so realistic. I'm sure most normal humans are pretty keen to take on an existence such as the one portrayed in 'Fight Club'. Surely the percentage of people in this world don't enjoy fighting. Fight Club made this out to be one of America's favourite pastimes. I've spent significant time in the USA and never saw one fight.It was a dull and boring movie, and I suggest Eddie Norton takes a good hard look at himself before being involved with a script like that again. Helena too. As for Bradles, after accepting a part in 'Legends of the Fall', nothing surprises me with his movie selections, even though the boy has talent. I feel this was more like some kind of hardcore modern fairytale as opposed to a realistic society pastime.",4,20,44,13 December 2000
Citizen Kane," The Greatest Boring Movie
","'Citizen Kane'. Great direction, Brilliant Script, Outstanding Acting, and Revolutionary camera angles. On technical merit it's a 10 out of 10. On maintaining the viewers interest a 3 out of 10. I've tried to enjoy this movie, but can only a appreciate it. Never underestimate the importance of enjoyment. Overall it's a 6.5 out of 10.",6,12,27,11 November 2000
X-Men," They Were Called X-Men
","I've never heard of this comic before and I hate comics in general, but I enjoyed this movie. I think some people are losing it a little with their big wraps of 'X-Men' though. It can surely only be described as a good fun movie that's not to be taken very seriously. Still Hugh Jackman was awesome and it managed to entertain me, and that's all I was after.",8,20,40,7 December 2000
The Beach," Sometimes Feet Can Get Sore
","....and people think I don't like any movies. Well, I liked it. The portrayal of a backpacker in 'The Beach' was fantastic, and had me immediately reminiscing of the places I had been to in the past. The idea of life on the beach is not so appealing for me. Two years and I'm out of there.",8,9,18,22 January 2001
U-571," An Incredibly Hideous Movie, AWFUL
","This was one of the most frustrating movies I have ever seen. Generally because it was unbelievably boring and pathetic which was always going to happen with Bon Don Govi walking around while they were trying to film. Surely they could have asked him to leave the set while the cameras were rolling.My frustration increased with the story which was portrayed as being true, yet was less accurate than a documentary suggesting Hitler was a nice guy who wanted the world to live in peace and harmony.I can't go on. Please, please don't see it.",1,17,34,27 December 2000
American Beauty," Another Backflip By The Academy
","It makes no sense that the people at the Academy awarded this movie the Oscar. Since when have they awarded great movies best picture? Maybe this is the beginning of a new Academy without the corruption that has ruled for so long.It was brilliant in every sense of the word, and should not be missed. Special mention must also be made to the excellent direction,  and superb acting from the entire cast.",9,12,23,27 December 2000
The Patriot," Painfully Too Long, And 'The Chip' Was In It.
","This is Mel Gibson's worst war movie, and another  Gibson movie having a dig at the English because of a chip he seems to have on his shoulder. 'Braveheart' was ten times better than 'The Patriot', and 'Gallipoli' was ten times better than 'Braveheart'. This makes for a very, very ordinary movie.Mel (or as I like to call him 'The Chip') needs to take a good hard look at himself in the future. People like Heath Ledger need to be shielded from 'The Chips' growing extremist views, and his dictatorship of the Hollywood circus.If 'The Chip' makes a fourth war movie, no doubt England will cop it again, and we'll all be bored out of our brains like we were for his third installment. Yes, 'The Patriot' was AWFUL.",2,11,24,24 December 2000
Being John Malkovich," Brilliant
","This off beat comedy is probably the best movie I've seen in the last 18 months. Regardless of whether the story is original, I enjoyed thinking of the possibilities the plot brought up. It was presented in an interesting and creative manner, and had excellent performances from the cast.The scene with the secretary and then the boss on the seven and a half floor was one of the great scenes in cinema.",9,12,27,27 December 2000
The Fast and the Furious," Cunning Cops
","Could there be a movie made in this world worse than this one? Of course there is but this is still a shocking movie. What chance does a remake of 'Point Break' seriously have? Neither contained a script worth performing, let alone an idea with originality. They both produced ordinary performances from the cast of alleged actors. They also both contained action scenes that were so ridiculous you could only smile at the the disgraceful way money is handed out to pretenders, sorry producers to make this crap.At least 'Point Break' mixed the action scenes between sky diving and surfing rather than the mundane street racing over an over. Maybe they could have towed someone on roller skates behind the cars for extra adrenaline.",1,20,41,23 May 2005
Independence Day," And Boy, He Could Fly
","Bill Pullman should stick to movies like 'Spaceballs'. As for the rest of the cast, what can you say? They obviously got paid more than the writers for this trash. I'm guessing the budget for the movie was $1 000 000 000, which can be broken down like this:ACTORS - $789WRITERS - $312SPECIAL EFFECTS - $999 998 479MISCELLANEOUS - $420As for the special effects, they were good. No more no less. They didn't make this a great movie though, so were probably a waste of $999 998 479. I'm sure it still made about $45 Billion at the box office though.Finally I would like to thank the Americans for saving the world. What a nation, is there anything they can't do? I knew handing out guns in the street would eventually pay off.",1,23,47,13 December 2000
Gone with the Wind," WHAT A LOONY
","Scarlett O'Hara is an absolute psycho. What a loser. I just can't believe that people liked her. She is a superficial and selfish b**ch.
I guess this means Vivien Leigh played the role magnificently. Most of the cast was pretty good, as was the whole film. The major problem was the ridiculous length of 'Gone with the Wind'. After the 150 minute mark of a film, every extra minute contributes to its own self destruction.
Overall, 7.5 out of 10. (Would have been higher if it wasn't for the ludicrous 222 minutes).",8,20,42,29 November 2000
Legends of the Fall," Simply Awful
","This movie had so little going for it, and gave even less. It tried in every facet of film making to be a classic and continually fell on its face. It can really only be described in six words.Awful, Woeful, Pathetic, Terrible, Painful, & Depressing.The truth is the entire family were losers. As harsh as this may sound it's true. If I belonged to a family like that I would have been out of there as soon as possible.",2,26,54,22 December 2000
Days of Thunder," Another Classic Mess
","After seeing this movie it's an amazing effort that Nicole Kidman received another movie offer. Her co stars can get away with bad movies and performances because of who they are, but this was Nic's first Hollywood gig. Luckily big Tommy was able to look after her and ensure blockbuster success to Kidman in the future. The biggest problem with the movie was the appalling script. Once again the big budget was able to overcome all these faults and turn it into a hit. If your wondering it's about car racing, I think, or something like that anyway.A generous 3 out of 10.",2,20,43,22 November 2000
Man on the Moon," Who's Andy?
","Knew the song, knew Jim, never heard of Andy. I don't know how alike Andy's life was to this movie, and it didn't really matter. If I knew more about Andy I may have enjoyed the movie even more than what I did. The song is better than ever, Jim was brilliant, and Andy is a funny guy.What's the Academy afraid of?",8,6,10,14 January 2001
Saving Private Ryan," This Movie Is Way Beyond 'Saving'
","Spielberg has once again lost the plot. This was a terrible war movie covering no new ground, but instead recycling the same old war issues in a dull manner. The opening scene was spectacular for five minutes and boring for the next twenty minutes. Enough is enough. In typical Spielster fashion the movie was too long, and the Spielster had way too much money in his budget. I would love to see him use some creative material like his 70's movies such as 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. How humiliated the Spielster must have felt after comparing the superb 'The Thin Red Line' next to his babbling mess.Sorry Spielster, 2 out of 10.",2,21,47,11 November 2000
Lawrence of Arabia," Can't Sleep at Night? Try Lawrence of Arabia
","The definition of an epic must surely be a film that is annoyingly too long. So many of the classics are so long and take so much time for anything to happen, that you are put to sleep before a word is even spoken.
'Lawrence of Arabia' is no exception, and for all the brilliant work that was put into making the film, it was all undone in taking 222 minutes to view it. If Lawrence could fit into 120-150 minutes, we would have had a winner. For Lawrence '6.5 out of 10'",7,22,40,29 November 2000
Garden State," We all have dreams, I know I do
","This was almost the perfect movie. The acting was great, the direction was great, the script was brilliant, and the location shoots were perfect. Probably the most amazing thing about this movie was the screen stealing show stopping performance of Natalie Portman. She showed this brilliance in 'Leon' aka 'The Professional', and once again amazed with her talent. It contains different humour to your usual American movie and was a needed hit in the movie circles of 2004.My only problem was a little part of the story that seemed out of place and not needed. This is not a spoiler, it is his friends wealth and invention. They just seemed unnecessary to me. This is a minor complaint and I eagerly anticipate Zach's next work. He could quite possibly end out being more famous behind the camera than in front of it.",8,62,99,29 December 2004
Mission: Impossible II," A Tough Couple Of Hours
","I wonder how it is people can say they not only thought this movie was good, but that they actually enjoyed it as well. It was so dull and boring I often felt like vomiting, as it contained the creativity of a Steven Segal movie.The acting was on the wrong side of awful and the story was so lacking in substance, you had to question who was in charge of such a rubble. The names are solely what got this movie made which is a sad day for the wasted talent pool of writers out there who can't get someone to back their original work.See it if you must, but remember, your better off going outside and crumbling leaves in your hands for two hours.",3,14,27,22 December 2000
The Insider," A Classic Vegetable Movie
","Once again I have found a movie that is like eating your vegies. You don't like them, but you know they're good.The truth is this movie was a little boring. The story is worth telling, the acting is worth rewarding, and the direction and script are both worth appreciating. So what is the problem?It's too long. Oh Yes, It's just too long.",7,10,19,9 January 2001
Quiz Show," Solid and Slow
","I hired this movie, watched it, and was neither impressed nor distraught with the result. I did expect a more enjoyable movie as I struggled to get into it. I'm a big fan of the cast who were good, and movies that are true stories when told accurately. It just moved a little too slowly. I think I'll watch it again.",6,3,11,6 December 2000
Mission: Impossible," He Really Sprints To The Bridge
","I got through 'Mission Impossible' fairly unscathed, which I believed to be quite a result. My hopes and expectations were low, and they were matched fairly accurately. What did stand out was Jean Reno, and the 'Mission Impossible' theme song. Without these I would have been in some severe pain for the entire movie.Everything else in the movie, such as the script, acting and special effects seemed pretty packaged. It was a successful marketing venture, with excellent financial support which ensured huge gross earnings. No more, no less. Who would have thought, however, a sequel could be made that was so much worse than what was already a bad movie.Oh yeah, certainly don't bother seeing it, or the sequel.",6,11,22,21 February 2002
The Hurricane," Sometimes He Got Cramp
","This was a typical Denzel Washington role and performance. It was predictable, yet good. The movie plodded along pushing the boundaries of an epic, although maintained enough viewer interest to avoid the need for a quick snooze. It was obviously not accurate which takes away from the emotion a movie like this is usually able to generate. The real hero in the movie was the guy who let Carter's saviours into the apartment opposite the prison.",5,9,18,22 January 2001
Reservoir Dogs," Rare Gold
","'Reservoir Dogs' has great casting, an amazing script, awesome characters and a classic sound track. Perhaps Mr. Pink should move to Australia, a society that tips only when someone deserves it and not because they are doing their job. It is very rare that I give a movie a 10 out of 10, but this movie is just gold.",10,18,36,11 November 2000
It's a Wonderful Life," George Bailey Please Stop Complaining
","This movie is like eating your vegies. You don't like them but you know they are good.I didn't really enjoy this movie. George Bailey gives so much in life and suffers because of it. He then starts complaining and having a cry over it all. Get over it mate. What was happening in his life happens a lot more often today, so he may have won the battle but he didn't win the war. Business is business and if you can't move with the times, you are almost bound to be unsuccessful.I didn't enjoy it because I found his personality so annoying. What this does mean is the movie got me thinking and Jimmy Stewart played his part well. I have only kind words to say about the production of the movie and definitely recommend it to all.7 out of 10.",7,11,25,1 December 2000
Die Hard," The Tips Of His Fingers Were Very Strong
","Easily the best Die Hard movie and a rare victory in this genre for the director and producers. I sat down and cheered Bruce on through this movie which is as rare as Michael Jordan being humble. This is the time of year to whack 'Die Hard' in the old DVD, and listen to the sweet 'Jingle Bell Rock' tune.",8,20,34,7 December 2000
The Bridge on the River Kwai," It's A Nice Bridge
","Yeah great movie, but WHY I ask WHY was it so long? Please! 155 minutes is too long. The first hour could have been cut by 20 minutes and then we may have had the greatest war movie ever. As it stands it is battling to make the top five. If your wondering 'Saving Private Ryan' wouldn't make my top 100 war movies.Still great job, 7.5 out of 10.",8,13,25,6 December 2000
The Green Mile," Please That's Enough Hanksy
","Tom Hanks seems to be obsessed with starring in movies that go for ridiculous lengths of time. Once again I was bored out of my brains watching Hanksy (who can act) work with nothing for 188 minutes. So much boredom, so much of my time wasted.I don't mind a magical story as long as the characters who are portrayed as normal humans react in such a manner. None of these characters did react realistically which quickly turned the movie into not only a raving bore, but an absolute farce as well.I didn't altogether hate this movie, even though it was awful. If the small potential it possessed was condensed into a two hour flick then it may have kept me from yawning for 188 ridiculously long minutes.",6,13,40,9 January 2001
Jaws," Nice Job Spielster
","This was when I liked Mr. Spielberg's movies. Jaws was an original movie that gave us suspense, entertainment, and a little bit of fear when going ocean swimming. The Spielster filmed some of 'Jaws' in Australia where great white sharks are a regular feature on the beaches. The sharks never swim between the flags though so you are safe there.Some movies don't age, although unfortunately for 'Jaws' the special effects cause it to age quite quickly. I won't hold this against the Spielster though, with 'Jaws' he came out with a classic.A well earned 7.5 out of 10 for the Spielster this time.",8,16,33,1 December 2000
Bring It On," Not Surprisingly Awful
","I went to this movie with such low expectations it could have surprised me but it didn't. It was exactly as bad as I expected it to be. It lacked funny material which was all that could have possibly saved it. The audience as a result was left with a story that a two year old could have developed more creatively. The acting was probably the best part of the movie, but don't be fooled, it was also awful.",3,10,22,21 December 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," Well Worth A Read.
","I enjoyed reading Stephen King's short story 'Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption' from the book 'Different Seasons' more than watching the movie. However, it's still one of my favourite movies of all time.It has very few peers, and has to be seen. It is Awesome.",10,20,37,26 December 2000
Platoon," Overrated, Yet Very Good
","I definitely smell an overrated movie here. 'Platoon' was very good and I did enjoy it. However, through no fault of its own, many people rave on about this movie as if it's the be all and end all of cinema. I ended out disappointed because of the huge expectations I had. It's definitely behind war movies like 'The Thin Red Line', 'Apocalypse Now', 'The Bridge Over The River Kwai', and 'Gallipoli'.Regardless, the above movies and 'Platoon' are so far ahead of 'Saving Private Ryan' it's a joke.Hey 'Platoon' (7.5/10) Nice Job Stoney.",7,12,25,3 December 2000
Any Given Sunday," The Movie Like The Sport Is Just Too Slow...
","It wasn't a great flick, but you can not blame Oliver Stone entirely for this. It's the game called Gridiron or American Football. Unless you're brought up on it, it can be very hard to enjoy. It seems after five to ten seconds of play you need to have another two minutes break of play. If the movie was a little more condensed then the action and story could have moved at a more interesting pace. The movie simply did not have enough story to stretch out for this long.In the end, in an appropriate irony, like the game of American football, the movie was just too stop start and drawn out. The sport and the movie could do with a little more continuity. Soccer has the continuity, although none of the toughness, and way too much rolling around in fake pain. Perhaps Australian Football or Gaelic Football could be a guide to the speed a tough game of football can be played. However, Oliver Stone is too good a director not to bounce back.",4,6,13,23 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Yawn Yawn Sell Out
","Congratulations Peter Jackson. Plenty of imagination is required to try and pull off a trilogy such as 'Lord Of The Rings'. Not to mention a country like New Zealand to film it in. It was just such a shame it was so boring.Now I admit I struggled through 'The Hobit', and never gave 'Lord Of the Rings' a chance in the paperback department. So I applaud your effort of keeping me a little interested throughout the movie. One of the two things that bothered me was the ridiculous length of the movie. I have three words that could have saved this movie from becoming a joke. POST PRODUCTION EDITING. I was laughing in the end at what a farce the movie had become. Perhaps the biggest disappointment was nothing to do with the movie but JRR Tolkien, who came up with surely the worst idea ever written on how a victory could be one. Writers block or just a cheap cheap sell out. You decide.",2,13,32,22 April 2005
The Truman Show," Lawn Mowing At Its Best
","'The Truman Show' owes a lot to the direction of Peter Weir. Weir refuses to pump out the movies in a search for extra dollars. Instead he chooses wisely and directs brilliantly. Just by looking at a list of his movies will surprise and even amaze you. So as you would imagine 'The Truman Show' is another success.Truman Burbank has the perfect life, or so he thought until finally his life long suspicions about his world begin to unravel. Even though the idea for Truman is not totally original, it is thought provoking enough and allows the audience to wonder, what if? If you think this couldn't happen, just look back over the years at the stupidity of the human race and think again.Jim Carrey once again nails his role, as do the entire cast. It is rare he fails to perform at a level that perfectly complements the movie and its genre. This is something he does not receive enough credit for. Acting for a comical role or a more dramatic role requires no less effort for the performance to be spot on.",8,113,138,10 July 2005
Jackie Brown," Easy Quentin, Easy.
","This is another very enjoyable Tarantino movie. I cannot get enough of his real time directing. I just hope that Quentin controls the length of his movies. 'Jackie Brown' just made it in the 150 minute time limit, and was definitely not too long. Should his movies start going for any longer, I'm saddened to say that we will be witnessing the decline of one of the greatest directors going around.",7,12,21,15 December 2000
True Romance," The Gun Had A Trigger
","I cannot ignore the influence Quentin Tarantino's script had over the style of direction in 'True Romance'. The scary part is, if Tarantino had directed, it probably would have been even better. The sacrifice he made ended out being well worth it though. The good acting from a strong cast completed this great movie. Christian Slater's wardrobe however, steals the show. 
8 out of 10.",8,87,142,7 December 2000
Gladiator," Too Long, Overrated & Close To Awful
","'Gladiator' was too long which ensured it to be quite often very boring. What really bothers me is how overrated 'Gladiator' is, upholding the tradition of all the modern day epic's. The simple minds of so many today fail to realize how uninspiring this movie was. It stuns me how audiences believe a movie is good when it's running time exceeds 150 minutes.'Gladiator' wasn't awful, however it got very close.",6,6,12,22 January 2001
The Wizard of Oz," Easy Big Fella
","'The Wizard of Oz' is a fantastic effort at making a movie. I have to wonder if it was possible to create a movie any better back in 1939. However, I am curious on the size of the budget allowed for production. The difference between todays big budget movies and those from sixty years ago, are today the scripts and plots are pathetic. This movie can be enjoyed by all ages, and perhaps led the way for musicals to be made into films.8 out of 10",8,27,53,29 November 2000
High Fidelity," One Of The Few Good Movies This Year
","'High Fidelity' was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise very ordinary year of cinema. Continually I have been disappointed with the quality of this years movies from all over the world, not just the regulation Hollywood trash.Admittedly my hopes weren't that high, but I still left the cinema feeling like I got what I paid for with 'High Fidelity' (this is very rare these days). John Cusack was his usual competent self, and Tim Robbins sensational in his small but humourous part.No masterpiece, but well worth watching.",8,44,67,13 December 2000
From Here to Eternity," Actually Very Good
","When I sat down to watch this movie I wasn't looking forward to it and didn't expect much. This is probably why I was so pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The characters were terrific, and the cast put in great performances. I certainly wouldn't say it was one of my all time favourite movies,  it wouldn't even make my top 100, but it is well worth watching.

"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Needed More Footage Of The Shoe Lace
","How could this movie have come from the writer and director of 'Fargo' and 'The Big Lebowski'. I was shattered during the screening, and left the cinema in a state of shock. It would be easy to blame Clooney as he ruins every movie, but this was a deeper problem. It failed in so many areas, especially the script.Perhaps the only ray of light was John Goodman, who continually impresses me with his acting. I'm prepared to give the Coen's more chances because of the awesome material they have produced in the past, but this will scar me for a while.",3,13,31,27 December 2000
The Godfather," IT'S JUST TOO LONG
","'The Godfather' is awesome. I could go on all day about all its strengths and why it is such a great movie. Instead I will comment on its weaknesses, or should I say weakness. It's too long. One thing that drives me nuts are movies that are a little bit too lengthy. Otherwise I loved everything about the Godfather.8 out of 10. (Pushing a 9)",9,19,40,29 November 2000
