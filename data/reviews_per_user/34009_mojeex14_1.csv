The Ring," Terrifying in the wrong sense
","Okay, first off, this movie was the kind that kept you terrified for days because it left you wondering so much.  This may or may not be a good thing. Scary movies are supposed to be thrilling, full of suspense, and horrifying. This film attributed to all three. That is, for me anyway. Though it was just because I thought of it so often. So, you have this mysterious tape that kills people.  Alright, I'll buy it if you can  make me BELIEVE it may be possible.  This was never identified. What? I suppose it's magic? Also if this little girl has so many powers,  why couldn't she ask for help when she was still alive? you know, like  send for the police or something. I think it's just down right rude to for her to kill innocent people because of her horrific life.  I mean, YOU'RE DEAD,GET OVER IT! Come to think of it, what the hell makes her so special, and able to perform these kind of tricks post mordem?  Plus, I never understood whether Samara was adopted or not.  I stepped upon this question while watching the DVD that enclosed some deleted scenes.  One of these scenes encases the reporter questioning some of the town locals.  One of the men stated something about the couple leaving town for a while and returning with the Mrs. Morgan pregnant. Though if the child was adopted, what makes her so 'gifted' and who where her parents? There, now with  my questions, or most of them, laid out on the table I can get to some complimenting. The movie was unique (not this version in particular, because 'Ringu' was the original that deserves the credit.)  It had thematic elements, great graphics, thrilling on-the-edge-of-your-seat scenes, and a good villain (though not a well defined nemesis.) So, if you're the kind of person who doesn't care for plot, go rent this one.  It's good to see with the boyfriend or girlfriend.  It has plenty of scenes they'll fling themselves upon you from.  So, in conclusion I fully agree with the comments of the previous. Though, of course, I had to satisfy my urge to trash a bit of this movie.  To be frank, I was disappointed in this film.  I felt it had good potential, but never filled its quota.",Null,0,1,16 July 2003
