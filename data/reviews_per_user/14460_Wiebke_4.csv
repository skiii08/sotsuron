Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," As Bad As It Gets
","My roommate and I refused to go see this in the movie. Nothing hyped that much could be good and besides, we heard it was bad. Well, finally, at long last, we borrowed a copy of it on videotape and we are now very proud of ourselves for being so on target.This movie is an example of a lot of things that can go wrong in movies. Primarily it's an example of moviemakers being out of touch with their audience and with the notion of what makes a good movie. It's also an example of special effects becoming a total distraction, with F/X people seemingly obsessed with doing things just to show off. The dialog is often ludicrous and the characterizations are extremely shallow -- guess they were worrying about effects, not plot. This movie also employs a lot of bizarre, mismatched accents (including ones that are difficult to understand) and on top of that, they lay on the ethnic stereotyping very thick (are those guys holding down the Naboo supposed to be Japanese?) On the positive side, I think the guy playing Obi-wan was very good. I loved the sets/stages used for the capital of Naboo -- looked like the Hagia Sophia. The pod race had awesome effects. I thought the Jedis' spacecraft was very sleek and nice. Overall, though, this movie sucks like a rotten egg.",3,0,1,8 August 2000
North by Northwest," Seems Like It Was Made Yesterday
","I'd seen this on video several times but when it played on a big screen at Piedmont Park here in Atlanta, I got a whole new experience and a fresh look at this classic. This movie doesn't bore for a second and keeps on going with one classic bit after another. The acting is outstanding, there is great humor in the script, the locations are unique, and the special effects are seemless. Cary Grant is at his absolute peak in this one and I would highly recommend it. As a side note, in the past year I've seen three Hitchcock films on the big screen (Rear Window and Vertigo, recently restored) and they've all been great. Hitchcock's work is so visual, it's great on a big screen and of course his soundtracks are worth a theater as well.",10,0,0,21 June 2000
Remember the Titans," American Sports Schlock Blocks Drama
","This was a seriously mediocre movie. It would be a good TV movie I guess. The direction was stupid, the screenplay incredibly predictable and clunky (esp. the first 1/2 hour!) and above it all, it was FOOTBALL FOOTBALL FOOTBALL. I just do not GET what the hell it is with football. At all.
I mean, watching it, I had a lot of questions, like 'Is that guy's job being coach for a high school team? That's his job?' Now, forgive me, I'm a Yankee, football had not so much meaning up where I grew up, so I'm totally confused. Is that normal? If so, give me a break! I've never heard of a public school coach who wasn't a teacher FIRST. So that confused me a lot. Second, all those resources. For football. Why? Everything about the set up in the movie (and yeah, I know it's a movie!) screamed 'Damn, this is a cash cow!' It was like going to one of those palaces in German with all the gold leaf -- sure, it's pretty, but the money from it came from the people's sweat and tears. On the positive side, I thought 'Sunshine,' the gay quarterback was cool and noted that hell, overall that team had a LOT of sissies in it, which was an interesting sub-plot underlying in there. Of course I'm not so sure the fact that boy didn't get his ass beat in was very realistic but hell, OK, didn't want to see him with black eyes myself either.",5,0,1,17 September 2003
The Matrix," Not to be pigeonholed
","This movie is the thinking man's action movie. In the theater I saw it, there were no thinking men and everyone liked the action scenes but the plot confused them. I was not confused. Stylistically, the movie has a lot going for it. It remind me of several others favorites of mine, including Mimic and several dystopian films.W",10,0,0,1 August 2000
