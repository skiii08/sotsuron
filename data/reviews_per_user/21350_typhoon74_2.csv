Scarface," Good back then? Parody today.
","Perhaps if I watched this movie in 1990, I would give it a better score, but now its just a parody of everything you can imagine;
<ul><li>Al Pacino yelling and screaming and angry every second of the movie (exhausting, give us a break, Al!). He is even worse than the many who made a parody of him when he is, exactly, angry and yelling.</li><li>Bad guys with machine guns. Very scary!</li><li>Undercover cops, who's not even a cop. Or are they? Good one!</li><li>Miami (enough said)</li><li>Greed. Yeah, it's not good for you...</li><li>Sniffing coke and making bad decisions, then regret when you're back in real life. I saw that one coming...</li><li>One million bullets and still standing and yelling, angrier than ever (grrrr!)</li></ul>This review is just as bad as the movie, but what are you gonna say. its just terrible.Oh, and I did not check the Yes-box for spoilers. Everyone knows that Pacino is...yeah, angry.",2,2,8,5 March 2019
1917," Beautiful boring
","Some nice scenes with beautiful (yet fake) light and some cool sound effects. Thats pretty much it for me. Obviously I belong to the minority since the average score is well above 8. But for me, this movie was extremely boring. I had absolutely zero connection to any of the characters and I just couldnt care less if they lived or died. The dialogue was completely flat and didnt create any emotions in me. At least not sad when I was supposed to feel sad. At times it felt like a mix of Saving Private Ryan and Lord of the Rings. It just lacked all the drama and great acting. It jumped to conclusions way too fast, and the main characters just didnt build a relationship to their audience.
Its actually beyond me if this movie win a single award. I just cant understand what that should be for.",2,5,13,7 February 2020
