The Blair Witch Project," The Horror Movie of the 90s.
","This is it, the movie that dethroned 'Scream', which is an amazing accomplishment.  There's a problem built into the horror genre, what's terrifying, over time, becomes commonplace and then tepid.  I don't think people who see films like 'Psycho', 'The Exorcist', 'Nightmare on Elm Street', etc., today are getting the same experience their parents and sometimes grandparents got the first time, audiences have become too media savvy, they know all of the rules.  'Scream' didn't break those rules, it made fun of them, it was entertaining but not that scary.'Blair Witch Project' is based on two premises which give the film it's power.  First, it's almost impossible to create a special effect today which an audience will buy as real, they might appreciate an effect but they won't believe in it, they've seen too much fake stuff.  'Blair Witch' gets around that problem by keeping it all off screen.  And second, if you want your audience to feel an emotion populate your film with self-indulgent drama queens.  I laugh at those who ever thought this film could be real but it's great entertainment.For my money the scariest film of the past several years is still 'Saving Private Ryan', the initial invasion scenes and the ones where Melish fights hand to hand to his death.  Terrifying and very well done.  'Blair Witch' is the second scariest but is much more in keeping with current definitions of 'hipness'.",Null,1,1,27 July 1999
Full Metal Jacket," I can't hear you!
","The only film which comes close to capturing what life was like for grunts in Vietnam--wait, that was Platoon!  This film would be crap w/o the bootcamp scenes.  But because they're in its great.  Ermey deserved all of the awards he could carry for his Sgt. Hartman.  He pulled off the near impossible--a character who is farcical and brutally realistic.  The rest of the film was was the usual 'oh boo hoo hoo, we're in Vietnam' claptrap put together by people who weren't there.  The whole sniper scene is overwrought but, if you think about it, pointless (people shot at us?  gosh she was a girl?  c'mon).  Kudos, though, for the seamy portrayal of the call girl scene.  Papillon Soo was cheated out of her best supporting actress award (and deserves royalties from every 2LiveCrew album ever sold).",Null,1,1,13 September 2003
Apocalypse Now," A Mess
","One of the most overrated films ever made.  'Apocalypse Now' is the confluence of brilliant directing and horrible screenwriting.  Wait, what script?  Coppola lifted the most memorable moments from a coffee table book on the Vietnam war (I think most fans of the film don't know this). 
War films are problematic from the get go because directors face overwhelming pressures to sensationalize the violence and preach to the audience.  Coppola does both.  What's worse is by film's end it's clear he doesn't have much to say ('the horror'? come on).Fortunately so many films have now been made about Vietnam that its intent to be some 'definitive statement' has receded and one can now appreciate the artistry.  Coppola is a brilliant director and even his train wrecks are worth watching.This is not a brilliant film, though.",Null,0,3,25 July 2003
Dirty Dancing," A Small Gem
","Those who look down on this movie and deride its fans might pay closer attention to the the very small details which make this film work.  Economic use of dialogue, superb lighting and camera work, buried in this film is a very sophisticated sense of myth and symbol which turns what should be a very tired story into an enjoyable ride.  Every moment accomplishes what it's supposed to, the film's intelligence plays out in small gestures, movements, no film better illustrates the truism that film is a visual medium.  Or one can forget all that and enjoy the chemistry between the two stars.  Those who call this film a guilty pleasure, though, shouldn't be that guilty.  A silly story is pushed to a high level by excellent craftsmanship.",Null,1,1,8 January 2000
Man on the Moon," Pulls Its Punches
","Jim Carry turns in an excellent performance in this film but is let down, as he was in Truman Show, by a director and writers who don't have the courage to go all the way.  While some tout Kaufman's originality this film had the vitality of a Wolfgang Puck tv dinner...yes, we know it's supposed to be gourmet food, so why does it go down like warmed-over meatloaf?Kaufman, let's face it, was an unhappy guy who used his comedy to work through some deep mental problems and never quite succeeded.  Was he a genius who died at the height of his powers?  No, by this time he was a has been.  Of course it would have been difficult for writers and directors to write close to the bone with the knowledge that those who loved and cared for him would be watching (indeed were part of the production), but how could Foreman, etc., not delve into the self-hatred and contempt for audience which was clearly a part of Kaufman's act?  I say that with respect for the dear departed, I was a fan, but I wasn't fooled, surely we're more sophisticated about these sorts of things.Watching this film reminded me of the feeling I got during the last few minutes of Truman Show, the directors and writers were opting to cut and run just when the story got good, when Truman was about to face the rest of the world, when the story might have a chance to say something original, nope, that was too risky.  Only in Man On the Moon such feelings lasted for two hours of movie.  Not brave, not a classic, this film will be forgotten quickly.",Null,0,0,28 December 1999
Enemy at the Gates," A Little Too Slow For Me
","I thought this was an okay film but was done in (as are many Hollywood films about historical events) by an preference for formula over true material. Why are directors and screenwriters reluctant to just tell the story they want to tell?  I left this film feeling like I'd seen it years ago. 
And for those who are curious.  Vasily Zeitsef was a real person (though not quite exactly the character portrayed by Jude Law, who still did an excellent job).  Tania Chernova was also a real person and their live affair actually happened (she was also a Russian-American and was a sniper in her own right, I can only wonder why screenwriters didn't run with a more accurate version of their story).As for Major Koenig and the duel--no one really knows if this happened, the story comes completely from the Russian side, this could have been propoganda, pure and simple, though snipers in Stalingrad definately fought it out with each other.  Oh, and Sasha was a real boy but played no role in the sniper events (the writers wrote him in, I guess, to make the film more dramatic).",Null,0,0,13 September 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Any Guy Who Doesn't Want to Get It On with Jennifer Connelly...
","...must be crazy!  I thought this film was wonderful.  I can't imagine how Hollywood could make a film which was more intelligent and sensitive about the subject of mental illness.  I write as someone who grew up in a family where a parent was suffering from...cockle doodle doo...paranoid schizophrenia, so I have some first hand experience of the malady.  Face it, people.  It's not a fun subject.  But this film did portray what it's like to be around someone who is suffering from this.  And...yikes...to actually suffer from it.  That's a small miracle.  If the screenwriter took a few liberties with the story, characters, and so on, he caught what mattered.  Nash's story is unique.  If he hadn't won the Nobel Prize there's no way this film would have been made (it would have lacked the 'Hollywood ending').  And that's the film's genius.  Because it does end this way the film makers are able to depict mental illness for what it is (and I can't think of another film which does this and isn't so depressing it drives away the audience).  Well done.  Clap clap clap.",Null,0,1,26 April 2003
Am√©lie," Wonderful
","All French films, to me, are the same, but 'Amelie' is a wonderful distillation with something new: Audrey Tautou's astonishing performance in the title role.  Nothing feels false or forced.  The cynics who don't like this film lack the imagination to approach it on a different level: one can see it as a testament to cultural malaise, the boredom which comes from living in the Paris of today, each character is trapped in a prison of his or her own making, do they escape or learn to accept the smallness of their lives?  Romantics will have no use for such interpretations, of course.  The story is magical.  The writing and camera work is superb.  Those who hate this film are either jealous or made of stone.",Null,0,1,27 August 2002
The Thin Red Line," War As Seen From the College Dorm
","Every so often a film is made which captures a few moments of experience from wartime, which conveys the sights, smells, and fears of those who have been touched by this unique human experience.  And then there are films which just pretend.'Thin Red Line' is one of the latter, it's the work of someone who is trying to imagine what he hasn't experienced and so we get a lot of water cooler philosophy.  I wanted to like this film.  The falseness of the premise, that soldiers, essentially, are walking philosophers, made that impossible.The number of muddled themes in this film, the nature of authority, myth of the noble savage, transported me back to some freshman room dorm.  There's very little in the way of character or story which compensates for this falseness of premise.Those who want a feel for the life of soldiers might check out E.B. Sledge, 'With the Old Breed', a memoir of Marines at Peliau, which is more cinematic than anything seen in this film.  The tightness of relationships forged in combat comes through, the fear experienced is real, the horror of it all is palpable.I have a lot more respect for the other war film of 1998, Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan', because while that film had flaws it did have moments of real authenticity.  Resisting the temptation to preach or choreograph in combat scenes, I think, should be a minimum requirement of modern war films.Those who enjoy water cooler conversation, who don't want to think 'outside of the box' (the conceit of this film is astounding), won't know what they missed.",Null,0,1,11 January 2000
The Godfather," Wowzers! Unoriginal?
","I got a laugh from the people who found this film to be unoriginal, lukewarm, or not up to the standards of other mob films or tv shows.  'The Godfather' is the grand daddy of them all! Coppola and Puzo practically invented the genre of 'mafiosi as Shakespeare'.  Given how subsequent films and tv shows have run with these themes (even done them to death) most of what you're left with in this film is acting and craftsmanship.  But man o man.  It doesn't get better.  'Shawshenk Redemption', in contrast, was a good installment of the Hallmark Hall of Fame.",Null,1,3,11 October 2003
