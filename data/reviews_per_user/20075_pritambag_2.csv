Your Name.," Love Story connected by an Auspicious Thread of time
",A love story set in two different times but connected by an Auspicious Thread. Many supernatural factors and time travel cross path with their story. All of a sudden everything gets vanished just like a dream. Yet the Auspicious Thread keeps them connected throughout the story. First of all Salute to such a concept and as an anime viewer this was my first film and I really enjoyed it. Cant wait to watch more like this.,9,0,0,14 May 2020
The Fault in Our Stars," Heartwarming and Engaging
","It has been the 4th time I have watched this film. Everytime I watch it, it really appears brand new to me. The storyline it self is a gem and the execution too is way brilliant. Though the ending was too tough to watch still it is so special. The performances of the lead actors and the ensemble cast is just brilliant. I personally love it till now and will surely recommend it. Do give it a watch.",9,0,0,30 April 2020
