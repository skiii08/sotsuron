Black Swan," Black Swan Down
","This isn't a movie review in the proper sense of the word, but more of a rant, mainly because the subject of this writing is... not a movie. What it is, is an amazing sum-up of all clichés people totally unfamiliar with any kind of performers - but especially with ballet dancers and classical musicians - think the lives of such persons to be like.There are quite a few movies on ballet out there, that can offer great studies in character development - like Billy Eliott, for instance; Black Swan though isn't one of them, simply because it has no characters to develop in the first place, just two-dimensional cartoon-figures who can think and speak and act in nothing but common-places.There are also quite a few movies out there that offer amazing, heart-breaking insights into the world of dancers - like The Red Shoes or A Chorus Line, but Black Swan isn't that either, opting instead to present nothing but prejudices and preconceptions that clearly have never been challenged by even the tiniest amount of research into reality whatsoever. People whose job is to be on a stage and perform regularly are disciplined - in body and mind. There are no hysterics, no psychological mumbo-jumbo fitting luxury house-wives with no occupation - and, since they are used to 'give' themselves to audiences on a regular basis, very little sexual immaturity.Last, not least: there are also movies about ballet and dance, that can be gripping thrillers. White Nights comes to mind. Black Swan obviously fails in that respect too, because thrillers are 'thrilling', which means that you cannot anticipate every word, every turn, every twist and still be supposed to wonder. From its first to its last scene, Black Swan leaves no doubts, offers no surprises, lights up no question marks. You know what it is, where it is going, how it will end and why.In addition to all that: the cinematography is inspired by Peter Berg (which is annoying even in an action movie), the script is lazy, the directing uninspired and the acting left to its own devices. Natalie Portman and Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey struggle with what they're given, but the truth is that they're given very little. (In fact, they are given nothing - little would have been an improvement here.) If you want a movie about ballet, dancing, music, psychology, characters or even thrill and horror, go look somewhere else. If, however, seeing Natalie Portman's transformation into Darth Vader is your thing, then by all means: go ahead! You'll find the experience rewarding, wooden dialogue and fiery eyes (yes, even THIS cliché appears) and all.",1,11,19,5 February 2011
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Almost a documentary
","There are many historical, so-called docu-dramas out there that are considerably less distanced, less balanced... In a movie the quiet, unexcited tone startles even more, but proves beneficiary to both the story and its messages.The character-portrays are superb, the atmosphere of a beginning national paranoia captured perfectly, Strathairn is simply marvelous.So the why just 7 points? Two reasons mainly: unnecessary sub-plots and George Clooney. As impressive as his work behind the camera is, in front of it he simply fails to convince.Despite the already reduced pathos still a case of 'less would have been more'.",7,1,2,6 February 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," A touch of Bollywood?
","Strange movie experience, really. Seldom have I seen a less differentiated 'historical' approach. The last piece of this kind that comes to mind is 300. My husband's spontaneous comment spoke volumes: 'An American movie?' No, go figure! And still historic tackiness from A to Z, sustained by a direction Cecil B. DeMile would have appreciated, an impression further emphasised by the music.So why the relatively high rating? Three reasons mainly: Blanchet, Rush, Owen. Their performances are worthy of kneeling down and adoring. Superb, really.Some astounding, superb DoP-work, too.Still: what a great movie this could have been!!!!",8,0,0,6 February 2008
