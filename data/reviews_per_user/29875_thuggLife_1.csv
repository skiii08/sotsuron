Scarface," The life of a gangster.
","Well, we have an excellent performance from Al Pacino(as usual), beside that a great story line, and a great director(De Palma). The story begins with Antonio Montana's deportation in U.S.A along with his friend Manny Ribera. In a very short time they enter in the world of cocaine dealing;after that, Tony and Many become the no.1 drugs dealers. But on the long road to the top Tony forget the no.1 rule of the game: Don't get high your on supply. I think that Tony was a sentimental guy, but he was afraid to show love on those close to him. And the first time when i see regret in Tony's eyes is after he killed Manny.",10,1,6,14 February 2006
