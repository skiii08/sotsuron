The Equalizer," The best comic book movie of the year
","I never saw the television show and I have no doubt that Denzel's Robert McCall character is quite different than the TV show character, but he certainly is the best superhero of the year. And that is simply what he is. Antoine Fuqua uses close ups of Denzel's face as he assesses impossible situations and then comes out unscathed usually leaving behind a pile of baddies. I was reminded of Christian Bale's Batman character in those scenes.Reviews of the film have been tepid so far mostly citing it as being clich√©d, and implausible, but looking at this like a superhero film elevates it considerably. The Russian mob characters are the heavily tattooed super villains led by the talented Marton Csokas. The violence is all comic book in its execution with a grand finale that takes place in a Home Depot type store. Let's just say Denzel gets creative with a host of the store's products. In fact, the only violence that did not seem comic book like was when the Csokas first exams photos of the bodies that were left in McCall's wake. And the best news of all is that when the film ends we are left with the feeling that we will be seeing McCall in action again, hopefully soon.",9,7,24,24 September 2014
War Dogs," Easily my favorite film so far this year.
","Usually at least 8 films on my 10 best list are released from October 1st on, but this one will sure make the list this year.If you are like me and thought that The Big Short should have won Best Picture last year and that in 2014 The Wolf of Wall Street should have won, and that ' Lord of War' is one of the most underrated films of all time, you will love War DogsMaybe not as good as those two Oscar films but awfully darned close. and better than The Lord of War.Funny , Suspenseful, extremely insightful, and though set during 2005- 2008 it has a soundtrack from the 60-80s that is pitch perfect.Loved Miles Teller and Jonah Hill. Teller is the best actor of his generation. Though this is probably not going to be his best performance this year. I have a feeling his performance in that Boxing film is Oscar bait. Jonah Hill plays the sort of character that he is best known for, but who cares he does it so well. I was not familiar with the female lead Ana De Armas, but she is mesmerizing.Bradley Cooper was terrific in a relatively small role as well.I can see hundreds of twenty somethings wanting to become War Dogs after seeing this film, but I a pretty certain that window of opportunity is closed. This has been a pretty disappointing year so far in film. My guilty pleasure was Tarzan, and I really liked Sing Street and 10 Cloverfield Lane but this is my first ten of the year. Maybe I should only have given it a 9, but I it certainly is the best film released in the last eight months, and you gotta give a 10 once in awhile.",10,19,38,15 August 2016
Deja Vu," Scott does it again
","There isn't another director working today whose films I look more forward to than Tony Scott's. Not his brother, not Spielberg, not Howard, not Tarantino,not Nolan, not Rami,OK maybe Scorcese and maybe the Coen brothers, but Scott's strength is that he is the PT Barnum of today's directors. Take Deja Vu, ridiculous plot with holes you could lead an elephant through (to continue with the circus metaphor), and yet not a frame was wasted. Critics have said that the convoluted plot took so much explanation that it dragged, and I just didn't feel that one iota. One thing Tony Scott's films don't do is drag. He just entertains like no other filmmaker today. Besides the Usual Suspects, True Romance is my favorite film of the last 20 years. The rest of his films are just solid entertainment. He is on a role that I hope will last for another 30 films. I love the guy, and Denzel is terrific as always of course.",8,0,2,8 December 2006
Unbreakable," Huge Disappointment
","All the ingredients were there for a terrific film.  But the weakness in 'Unbreakable' surprisingly came down to a very weak script.  I believe that Mr. Shyamalan's 'Sixth Sense' was one of the nicest surprises of the last few years.  'Unbreakable' could have used a lot of reworking.  The premise was fine, but boy what a letdown.  You know I hate it when critics say 'You know if they'd only done this or that it would have been a great film.'  But this is one film where I feel that most of us who felt that it was a weak trifle would have such comments.  I expect great things from M Night Shyamalan in the future.  Let's hope that twenty years from now 'Unbreakable' is looked at as the weak point in his career as opposed to the 'Sixth Sense' being the writer/director's one hit wonder. 5/10",5,0,0,5 July 2001
The English Patient," The Worst 'Best Picture' in my Lifetime
","I'm 48 years old.  Can't think of any Best Picture Oscar winner that was this bad.  Not a horrible movie, but really weak.  I have not seen Cold Mountain yet.  I did see 'Talented Mr. Ripley' and liked it a lot , but Mr. Minghella's direction on this film was so overrated.  Really boring.",6,0,5,11 January 2004
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Just one little gripe
","Narnia is far better than I ever hoped it would be due to the amazing effects and the wonderful Tilda Swinton, but here is my one problem with the film. I never new fully appreciated Daniel Radcliffe and his fellow Hogwarts classmates until today. Strangely enough I liked this better than any of the Potter movies (haven't seen Goblet yet), but I had a big problem with the male children and a lesser problem with the females. They simply were not up to the task. The boy who played Edward made me feel that I was watching a school play. He was quite awful. I have only read the Magician's Nephew which had a different set of children in the story. I hope the other 6 books are the same way. Let's put it this way. Dakota Fanning doesn't have to worry about losing any future roles to any of these kids. I found the Christian elements of the film were handled quite well also. This was a rendering of Lewis's vision and to downplay it too much would not be faithful to the story to overdo it would have made the film play like a Sunday School special. It was a difficult task and the filmmakers are to be applauded. Certain to make gobs of money. Would not recommend it to the very little ones. My daughter is a very bright 6 year old. she loved it, but she held on tight and looked away several times. Don't go any younger than a bright 6 year old. And if you don't have any kids go anyway. You're bound to enjoy.",9,0,1,10 December 2005
The Rocker," I consistently smiled and occasionally laughed
","I enjoyed this film and would recommend it, but by the time it is actually released, I expect to have almost forgotten it. I really liked the young actors that made up the band, and I have always enjoyed Rainn Wilson, but I like his work on 6 Feet Under and the Office much more. Josh Gad is particularly likable and I have a feeling he will be in a lot more teen type comedies. Overall I just have to say it is a pretty lightweight film. If you wait until DVD you won't be making a mistake, but I think it will have a wide appeal.Unlike the other posters so far, I wouldn't recommend taking little ones to it. OK for 11 and up is my take on it. A lot of MILF talk and such, particularly by the socially inept band manager played by Jason Sudiekis.",7,4,10,10 July 2008
The Girl Next Door," Great chick flick
","It was IMDB's description of this film that made me run out to see it this weekend and I quote from the IMDB daily news of 4/8/04 'On another front, two new films aimed at female moviegoers will be battling it out -- 20th Century Fox's The Girl Next Door, and Miramax's Ella Enchanted.'  I'm going to go see 'Ella Enchanted' next, but not since 'Mona Lisa Smile' or 'Fried Green Tomatoes' has my estrogen flowed with such vigor and that includes 'The Prince and me' which was released just last week.  'The Girl Next Door' ushers in the chick flick for the 21st century!  Forget the Alamo folks;if Elisha Cuthbert is the new queen of the chick flick, then I want to climb aboard!",8,0,0,8 April 2004
Oldboy," I don't get it.
","Nothing about this film rang true. I've enjoyed a lot of Asian cinema, but perhaps I have just no understanding of the Korean culture. Little that the characters did during the entire film made much sense. There were some wonderful individual scenes and great camera-work, but that didn't make up for a lot of things in the film that appeared for lack of a better word 'lame'. An example is when Oldboy holds off a gang of thugs with a hammer. It didn't work as 'comic book' action nor as a realistic fight. Another example is the ant thing. Especially the giant ant on the subway. 'Hey, this would look arty' Really disagree with those that loved this film. It has its merits. I wasn't fooled by the ending twist. Some disgusting scenes that made little sense. Just overall forgettable. I must admit though, I'm really curious how the American remake will turn out.",6,88,199,8 September 2005
Finding Nemo," Pixar films keep improving
","I was not much of a fan of 'a Bug's Life'.  I kind of enjoyedToy Story, and I thought Toy Story2 and Monster's Inc. were both terrific. Nemo though is the best of the bunch.  Most critics say that the story in Nemo does not have the same appeal to the adults as Pixar's other films, but I truly disagree.  The character of Nemo voiced by Albert Brooks is just like the neurotic characters that Brooks plays in his live action films and every bit as funny.  I've never been a big Ellen DeGeneres fan but she also does a terrific job.  Kudos to Pixar they just keep getting better and better!",9,1,2,2 June 2003
About Time," There is something very special about this film....
","It is not a great movie by any means. Its' plot is ludicrous and full of logical holes,but it that rare true feel good film. There are probably less than twenty films that I have watched more than 2 times in my life. Three of them are films that I watch when I need to get out of a funk. I would imagine a lot of people have films that do that for them, classics like It's a Wonderful Life or Forrest Gump for instance, but for me they are Harold and Maude, Breaking Away, and the much less well known but very special film - Let It Ride. About time is now number 4 on the list. I really don't see this as much as a romantic comedy as a film about learning to wake up and smell the roses. I left the theater so full of thoughts about how to approach life and what is important. See this film when you are feeling like life just sucks cause you will leave the theater feeling just the opposite. I will add this film to my very small DVD collection when it is released. Normally there are just too many films that I have not seen and want to see, for me to spend a couple hours with repeated viewings but I am sure I will need an About Time fix at least once a year.",10,4,8,24 October 2013
Match Point," 1st Woody Allen Movie that was any good since his wife was born
","I loved Woody Allen's early work, but somewhere along the line like many other of his fans, I became fed up with him. It's not that he kept doing the same stuff. He really didn't. His style was distinct though. And much of his work became tiresome. That is why Match Point is so great. It does not play at all like a Woody Allen film. It is not a comfortable film by any means. I felt like I was constantly squirming through every scene. I'll admit there was a part of me that was happy to get out of the theater. I think about the intended audience for say 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. And I would describe match Point as Texas Chainsaw Massacre for people with an intellect. That is an odd description, I know. My point is that they both have the same effect on ones bottom action in their seat. They admittedly go at it in very different ways though. I love the payoff at the end. I enjoy the commentaries about the effects of luck and faith on the paths of our lives. The actors were all superb. I hope this signals in a new era for Mr. Allen. The man can coax very good work out of his actors. He has proved this before and it all gels so well in Match Point. See it. You're going to squirm.",9,0,0,3 February 2006
Crash," I cannot think of a more powerful film
","I hope this film is remembered at Oscar time. It is simply brilliant. Haggis is a master craftsman. 'Crash' should be required watching in every high school. On the surface racism rings out as the pervading theme, but it goes so far beyond that. Watching it one week after hurricane Katrina walloped the Gulf Coast made 'Crash' more relevant than ever. We are a world fueled by anger that stems from misunderstanding and ignorance. That's it, in a nutshell. There are scenes in this film that I will never forget. Don Cheadle's final scene with his mother. Sandra Bullock hugging her maid. The impenetrable cloak put to a test. There are some films with great promise coming out between now and the end of the year, but I doubt any of them will come close to this masterpiece.",10,7,17,10 September 2005
Begin Again," The music in our lives
","I was a big fan of the group the Frames and was very excited when I learned about 'Once' directed by John Carney and starring Glen Hasard both members of the Frames. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but it had an almost documentary like feel to it. Begin again for me was a statement about how music affects our lives and how different songs can take on different meanings for all of us. For my wife and myself , Ben Folds the Luckiest has a special meaning in our relationship, to most others, it is just another song.I loved how Begin Again opens with a rather banal sounding song being sung by Kiera Knightly in a small nightclub as Ruffalo stands enthralled. Then for the next 15 minutes we discover why.The movie uses music in that way several times and I felt it really worked. Your enjoyment of the film will probably be greatly determined by what you think of the music. I happened to love it. Even that banal song soon takes on all new meaning. The entire cast is great and Ruffalo certainly delivers one of his strongest performances.I have not seen Words and Pictures. My limited knowledge of the film is that it might have a similar theme when it comes to music in our lives. This is a little feel good movie. The kind of film that is a welcome respite in Summer blockbuster season. Last year we had the Way Way back to fill this niche. This year is is Begin Again.",8,58,83,26 June 2014
Elf," Simply the best Christmas movie that I have ever seen.
","I gave Elf a 10 and I'm 48 years old.  I gave it a ten for the fact that it is the best movie in it's genre that I have ever seen. Although 'A Christmas Story' and the old Alistair Sims 'A Christmas Carol' are two other terrific holiday movies, most Christmas flicks are fairly weak.  I guess I must have been in the right mood to like this movie so much but everything worked so well in a film where everything had the potential to really suck.   Will Farrel is the major reason behind the success of this movie.  I could not imagine another actor being able to pull the character off.  Enough said. Go see it with your whole family.",10,1,4,8 November 2003
Gone Baby Gone," Gut Wrenching
","I loved this film, and it is clear that Ben Affleck belongs behind the camera not in front of it. I think he aspires to be the Clint Eastwood of his generation, and with this directorial debut I have every reason to believe that he will succeed.This is a very downbeat film though, and perhaps that is what kept me from giving it a 10. It ultimately deals with a moral dilemma, which I cannot discuss without utterly spoiling the film. Suffice it to say that Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan do a terrific job as well as Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman and a host of smaller role players that helped Ben Affleck to create so genuine a film. Possible spoiler occurs here- I loved the final scene in the film as the camera pans away and the viewer is left to think what is going through the head of the Casey Affleck character at that moment just after a doll's name is revealed to be Annabelle instead of Mirabelle. Just one little line that is so telling. Great cinema.",9,4,9,22 October 2007
Baby Driver," Believe the hype
","Everything about the film is pretty much pitch perfect if you ask me. Lets start with the cars. I have not been a fan of Fast and Furious films, but the chase scenes in this film run circles around that series if a certain reality of the moves matters to you. This is more in line with Bullit,French Connection, and the Italian Job films as far as great chases.The music, fun, simply fun. Songs from every decade of my lifetime. Action best pure adrenaline action in years. You will be truly on the edge of your seat during much of the film.Humor, what can I say, love Edgar Wright's humor and this is his best.And oh what a cast! Loved every one of the leads performances. I think Ansel was a standout, but come on Jamie Foxx, Spacey, Hamm and the beautiful Lily James. And the other leading lady, Eiza Gonzalez, was unknown to me, but she was great with one terrific diner speech in particular. I was lucky enough to see this at an early screening in Denver. I will be seeing this in the theaters once again when it opens, and I very rarely watch movies more than once.Sometimes when I see a review fawning over a film like this, I think troll. Best way to check that out is see how many films the reviewer has reviewed and rated. I have over 4,000 rated films here. Not a lot of tens either.Best film so far this year.",10,364,680,22 June 2017
Wanted," I truly did not expect much
","I really was not impressed with the trailer for this film. I went for 3 reasons. I think Angie Jolie is the most beautiful woman in the world. I kind of liked the director's style in 'Nightwatch' (didn't see the other 2 in the trilogy), and the kicker was the solid reviews that made it sound a lot better than the trailer looked. I am glad the reviews pulled me in because Angie could not have done it alone. I never paid for Tomb Raider because every single movie ever made from a video game pretty much sucks in my opinion. This is a film you really must savor on the big screen. The action almost never lets up and when it does there is a solid fun story going on. Is the premise ridiculous? Absolutely. Who cares? I just hope they make a sequel, because I am under the impression it is adapted from a graphic novel that I would expect may be a series. I would make another comment about that, but I want to avoid any spoilers. Go see this film now, you will not regret it.",10,3,9,28 June 2008
Dunkirk," Micro as opposed to macro version of the battle
","Saw an early screening tonight in Denver.I don't know where to begin. So I will start at the weakest link. The acting. Still great, but any passable actor could have been given any of the major roles and done a great job. I know almost no more about the battle of Dunkirk after seeing the film than I did before, and I am not exactly a WWII historian. Truth be told, I learned all I know about the battle of Dunkirk from the movie poster. Does that weaken the film? Hell no, this is a film about survival. The opening scene tells it all and sets the stage as we get our first glimpse into a young soldier's need to stay alive, and his creative attempts to do so. That actor may even be considered the main character of the film. More words have been written so far in this review than he speaks. And I have no clue who the actor in that role is. It is humorous that Tom Hardy looks like Bane through most the film in the role of a pilot wearing an oxygen mask throughout. Kenneth Branagh is the only officer with any lines in the film, so that should give you an idea of the POV that we experience. We are the enlisted man trying to find a way to stay alive in a chaotic and harrowing battle. Though I believe Dunkirk will win every single technical Oscar, I would be surprised if it has any acting nominations at all.How does Nolan elevate this above other films of a similar nature? I think he says it best himself, when he describes Dunkirk as a thriller more than a war film. He pulls that off superbly.When a ship starts to take in water as numerous bullets penetrate its hull, I wanted to jump out of my seat and cover up the holes myself.The film has three separate stories that are titled Mole, Sea and Air. And we all know where Moles live. The way the narratives of the three stories unfold and how they are all tied together is what makes the film a masterpiece. Much has been said about Nolan using IMAX film cameras and how the film is enriched by this. I don't know. I doubt I saw actual film being projected at my screening. Every frame looked terrific though. So what is the most superlative aspect of the film? Gotta be the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer will win the Oscar for this without a doubt. So , so brilliant. This is not a soundtrack that I would buy at the store and play on my stereo. This is a soundtrack that weaves throughout the three narratives seamlessly and creates this phenomenal sense of tension. There are times when a two or three minute tense orchestral passage plays continuously as the story shifts from the ground to the sea then to the air and the music draws the three stories together. Zimmer's soundtrack reminds me of the way that Bernard Hermann's work was so vitally important in building suspense in most Hitchcock films. Though that description almost sells Zimmer short. His soundtrack is that good.I don't think this is a film that will retain even half of its strength in your home theater. No folks, this is a film that you cough up for an overpriced IMAX ticket and rationalize it by knowing that experiencing Dunkirk in any other fashion will just not cut it.",10,489,877,17 July 2017
Enchanted," I think I liked it as much as my eight year old daughter
","I am trying to think of a family film that I enjoyed more than this. There isn't one. It was that good. Disney has a huge hit on their hands. Acting was great all around. It was Amy Adams' film though and her portrayal of Giselle was wonderful. I hated her in 'Junebug' and she got an Oscar nod for that. Of course I thought that whole film stank, but she has done great work since. This is going to be the role that brings her to A list status and make her a household name. I can't imagine someone not liking Enchanted. Well actually I can, but I feel sorry for them, cause they would have to be a troubled soul. James Marsden gets some of the best lines as a totally narcissistic Prince.I have always liked Patrick Dempsey and he does great work as a straight man to Amy Adams princess shtick. (I have to throw a plug in for 'Some Girls' an underrated classic that he did in his early 20's. If you have never seen it, rent it. It is hilarious. R-rated for a good reason though.)",10,5,8,20 November 2007
No Country for Old Men," Rather faithful to the book and therein lies the problem
","I read the book about two years ago to the day, and I was very excited when I heard the Cohen brothers were filming this. It is my favorite McCarthy book until the last third when he hammers and hammers and hammers in the message about as subtly as Chigur's weapon of choice. I gave the film an 8 because Bardem is a sight to behold. Probably the best villain since 1991 when my two favorite villains of all time appeared on screen within months of each other. Lecter and DeNiro's Cape Fear character. The funny thing is I expect Daniel Day Lewis to outdo Bardem this year but I have yet to see 'There Will Be Blood'.I was anticipating this film more than any other this year, so as a result I have to say I was disappointed. Tommy Lee Jones character of Sheriff Bell was hard to get a grasp on. I have to admit I had the same problem with the book. The Cohen's did not improve on that. At the end of the day, Bell is the star of both the book and the movie, though I question if both the book and the movie may have been better if the character did not even exist. I am not alone in this thinking. A lot of people in the theater I watched the film in were baffled and seemed to have felt cheated by the non-Hollywood ending. On guy yelled at the end, 'I want my 2 hours back.' and someone else chimed in, 'I'll just take my money.' Me, I didn't feel cheated, but I have to admit to slight befuddlement even after having read the fine book. You have been warned. Don't expect too much or a standard ending, and you won't be too disappointed. There is still a lot to like in this film. The Coen's are masters.",8,2,10,18 November 2007
Revolutionary Road," About as close to perfect as any film that I have ever seen.
","So why do I give it 9 out of ten? Because watching it was not exactly an enjoyable experience and I would not recommend this to everyone. But Sam Mendes may be the best director working in Hollywood today. Each and every performance in this film is nothing short of brilliant. Kate Winslet gives her best performance to date here and I think the same can be said of Leo. Though I continue to admire the hell out of almost everything that he has done. Michael Shannon should have gotten some sort of supporting actor nod. His character of John Givings as sort of the Id personified was probably the most difficult part in the film and he just did an outstanding job. I could go on and on,just don't make me ever see the film again.",9,0,0,4 September 2009
Drive," Stylish Thriller
","On a pure visceral level the opening scene of Drive is arguably the film's best. Not to say that it goes downhill from there; rather it is brilliant and almost silent, and it gets the audience on the edge of their seat before slowing down into a terrific first act during which the unnamed Gosling character and Mulligan establish their relationship. I have seen Nicholas Winding Refn's Pusher series and Bronson films, and he really knows how to get wonderful performances out of his actors. The ironic thing is that some of the greatest acting scenes in the film come when Gosling and Mulligan have no dialog whatsoever. I am a huge Gosling fan. He along with Joseph Gordon-Leavitt are my favorite young actors working today. Gordon-Leavitt's 50/50 is my favorite film so far this year (Caught it at an advance screening as I was able to see this film as well.) I think Gordon- Leavitt will receive an Oscar nomination this year, not so much Gosling this time around, but he does a terrific job. Strangely enough I could see Mulligan getting nominated for her portrayal of Irene.When watching this film I was reminded mostly of Micheal Mann's 'Thief' in both style and its' use of violence, but I was also reminded of early John Woo Chinese action film's like 'The Killer' and 'Hard Boiled' perhaps more from the weird soundtrack than from the actual style of the violence. And let me tell you, the soundtrack is very weird. At times it works quite well, at times not so much. When the music is instrumental it is perfect. Like Tangerine Dream in 'Thief'. Perhaps it was Tangerine Dream doing the instrumentals here as well, I am not sure, but the 80's sounding vocal songs were just weird. For the most part I found them annoying though once or twice they had a successful effect. I found myself thinking about the director, this guy sure knows how to put together a film, but he sure has awful taste in music. John Woo's Chinese soundtracks also used a lot of odd music to accompany brutal scenes of violence. And make no mistake about it, this film has the most brutal scenes of violence of any film ever made. But I gotta say, they really work.Don't go expecting a pure action film though, it certainly isn't. There are long stretches of silence and pauses that worked 100% for me to understand the characters and their relationships. Some viewers will literally hate those scenes. If you can't wait for Transformers 4, this may not be your cup of tea.I really don't want to give away too many spoilers but I do want to mention one very cool scene at the end where Refn creates this metaphor of a Scorpion via the Gosling character. It really is an image stuck in my head.I didn't recognize Bryan Cranston for a few minutes while watching his character. Since 'Breaking Bad' is my absolute favorite TV show, I found that very commendable for him and it says a lot about his true talent as a character actor. Albert Brooks whose 'Lost in America' remains one of my all time favorite comedies, is anything but comic here and he is brilliant. Ron Perlman also delivers a strong performance.This film is not for everyone; but if what you have read about the film from me and the critics and folks that have been lucky enough to have seen it already, make you want to see it, then you are very likely to love it.",9,3,11,10 September 2011
The Incredibles," Sure is hard not to use the word incredible in this one line intro...
","I saw this flick and thought to myself that Pixar has actually bettered themselves once again. It is truly an amazing achievement by this company. Each and every one of their films has gotten better. A part of this can be attributed to technical proficiency of the art form, but more important is the terrific stories. I really enjoyed myself throughout this entire film and often had my jaw open in amazement during the action scenes. And one more important achievement of this film is the unique vision that Brad Bird brought to the table. It really offsets 'The Incredibles' from any previous Pixar film. The PG rating is a bit telling in that my 5 year old daughter didn't enjoy this one half as much as her mom and myself,but from 7 or 8 on everyone will love this film. I do not mean to imply that 'The Incredibles' is too intense for 6 and under. I'm just not sure it plays as well to them as say a Shrek or a Disney animated tale. Of course it may play better to boys of that age. Which brings me to my next observation. NO way , and I repeat NO Way will Pixar outdo themselves once again in 2005. The trailer at the beginning of the Incredibles was for next years release 'Cars' which looked fairly pedestrian. However if I were an 8 year old boy...then maybe I'd be getting excited already.",10,0,1,5 November 2004
The Mist," Parts of the film were a 10 and parts were a 1
","Never quite seen anything like the Mist. First of all, if you see it, and anyone who has any love for good horror films needs to see this, you really must see it on the big screen. Darabont's 'Shawshank Redemption' bombed at the box office and became a huge success after it was released on DVD. This is a better film in my opinion, but I am not one of Shawshank's biggest fans. However this will not gain the status that Shawshank did post it's theatrical release since the stuff that should play well on the small screen is pretty awful. Let me explain. The special effects, the creatures, the chilling scenes with them. That is the 10 part. There were several scenes that are quite frankly Alien and Carpenter's Thing type classic and you just have to see the film for that. And the message is anti-fear and how the military industrial complex instills this in us and controls us, and it is anti-evangelical for doing the same thing. I am a liberal. I agree whole heartedly with the films message, but it is so ham handed that it really becomes annoying. And Marcia Gay Harden's character could take the prize for the most annoying character ever to grace the silver screen. You don't believe for a moment anything about her character or really anything about any of the stupid symbolic characters that side with her. Bottom line is the stupid people are worse than the dumb teenagers in a slasher flick and about as believable. That being said there is lot of homage to the horror films of the 50's and even a Twilight Zone type twist that makes this a great film. But the bad parts are really really bad. I can only imagine how a politically conservative viewer would really get their bile worked up watching this.",9,0,2,3 December 2007
Sing Street," Carney is now 3 and O
","I was a fan of Carney's band the Frames, and was delighted to see his first low budget film , 'Once' His second wonderful film had a much bigger budget and well know cast, but still a small film. I just loved, 'Begin Again' with Mark Ruffalo, Adam Levine, and Kiera Knightly.He goes back to his roots with Sing Street and it is simply a joyful experience. It started off a bit slow for me. But as the band that is the focal point of the film hones their skills and improves so does this wonderful story. I just can't say enough about how great the two leads were in this film Ferdia Walsh-Peelo plays the male lead Conor, and Lucy Boynton as Raphina were just wonderful. It is a great film to watch if you are having trouble getting your smile on. As an American I had a little trouble at times with the thick Irish accents. When I watch the CD I may have to stick the subtitles on.I wish the film had a bit of a bigger budget in the sense that it looks like it was made on a tiny budget and musicals are much better when the sound is powerful. But that is just quibbling. Go see this in the theaters, if for nothing else to make sure Carney gets money to keep making films.",9,42,66,22 March 2016
Saw," Revives my interest in the horror genre...
","It was about the time that 'The Blair Witch Project' made a jillion dollars when I decided that I no longer understood what made a good horror flick and that the genre was something that I was no longer interested in. The big budgets can't get it right anymore and neither can the indies. I've enjoyed the recent Japanese remakes somewhat, but have not been enjoyed all the video game flicks or the recent popular remakes of horror classics. (Of course, I don't care for either of 'the dawn of the dead' flicks so I'm stretching to call the original a classic). But 'Saw' is really good. It had a clever script with a twist that I did not see coming. Yeah it was a bit over the top a couple of times on the disgust-o-meter, but only a couple of times. I'm looking forward to the inevitable sequel; although the clever twist cannot be duplicated effectively which may dampen the sequels effect. But here are my gripes. I can't stand Cary Elwes. Never have liked the guy. He's a pretty boy that never was that pretty. Now at 40 something....well let me put it this way, if you're a male wearing eye makeup or eye shadow or whatever the hell he was wearing all during 'Saw' you probably wouldn't have a wife and kid to worry about. And the guy is so fey to go along with it. Was that the character or the actor. If that was the character I say bad choice. If that was the actor I say bad actor. Actually, I say bad actor in either scenario. Second gripe. For the sequel, Mr. Wan, 86 the editing while on meth. Those speed cuts are really annoying. Like when Danny Glover has a car chase with the orderly guy and those flashback scenes. Take a deep breath and slow it down. Your entire audience does not have AADD. A lot of them probably, but not all.",8,0,1,21 February 2005
The Descent," Why this film works so well
","There is so much bad horror being made today that when a good one comes around it is worth rejoicing. Usually when I see a scary film and a monster or creature doesn't show up for 20 minutes I get a little miffed. Well guess what folks, the first creature in this film really shows up close to an hour into the film and well past the half way mark. But Neil Marshall creates a wonderful drama between the group of all female spelunkers and he also directs some real action movie drama as they negotiate through the perils of an underground cave. I really enjoyed the creatures; although I felt their underground senses and abilities seemed to vary from scene to scene.Marshall doesn't exploit the women in the film sexually as is the case in almost every horror film in the last 20 years and the film is much better for it. I did not care much for Marshall's much lauded 'Dog Soldiers' but I have a feeling this writer director has a long and successful career ahead of him.",9,2,5,6 January 2007
Parasite," A review from a non Bong Joon-Ho fan.
","I have seen every film he has made other than his first film. I liked them all but felt all of them were overrated other than Memories of Murder. I felt that second film of his was his best until Parasite . I loved every frame of this film. And such a creative plot. This is easily my favorite non American film in years. It is the kind of film that you see with a friend or your partner and want to discuss for hours. It is not a film I really want to discuss too much.The less you know the better.
The purpose of this review is to tell people that have felt the same way about Bong Joon-Ho as I have in the past, that this time all the accolades are deserved. This is a true masterpiece that will be studied for years to come in film classes all over the world.",10,14,21,5 November 2019
The Conjuring," This will become a horror classic
","I don't want to sound like a shill for the studio but this is the truth. You don't want to wait for this one to hit DVD if you are at all a fan of the genre. The Conjuring relies a lot on things that go bump in the night and do they ever bump. It will lose a lot of its effectiveness on even the best home system. I was reminded a lot of the original Haunting by the loud sounds in the film and how they were used effectively to scare the audience. Lily Taylor rises above an overall solid cast to play the mother of the haunted family and she really delivers the goods. James Wan has made his best film to date with this solid horror film that hearkens back to the ones best remembered from my childhood, The Amityville Horror, The Exorcist, The Haunting, and Poltergeist. Being set in the 70's really helps give it the feel of those haunted house classics. The movie starts with a nice subplot piece with a couple good scares and then slows down for about a half hour or so of setup before revving up into one hell of a scare fest. I don't want to reveal too much of the plot, other than to say it sure made me curious about the work of Ed and Lorraine Warren, the investigators in the film that were also involved with the Amityville Horror. Now if the filmmakers will just let this one lie on its own and don't try to milk the idea for a series of films like was done with the other famous Warren case, things will be just about near perfect scary.",8,16,33,8 July 2013
1408," I have to throw my two cents in here and give some kudos to Hafstrom
","This is one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever and without a doubt the best in well over 20 years, as has been said by many of the other reviewers. John Cusack gives an Oscar worthy performance as well. Though I highly doubt he will be recognized come Oscar time, it truly is a tour de force performance. But no one seems to be giving Hafstrom praises. Along with John Dahl and Gregory Hoblit, Hafstrom ranks in my list of little talked about directors whose films I plan to never miss. You liked this film and you don't mind subtitles, then check out 'Evil'. Don't be fooled that it is another horror film though. It is more a coming of age tale, but truly gripping. The guy is an excellent director. 'Derailed' was nothing great but it was a very solid and entertaining film as well. I really like this guy. One more thing, catch 1408 in the theater if you can. I think most home systems won't capture the sound quality that made me jump several times while watching this solid scary film yesterday.",8,1,2,23 June 2007
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," If Sheldon Cooper had a top ten list.
","I think this would be his favorite comic book film. I say that because more than any other comic book film to date it appeals to fan boys with a couple obscure references, that my comic nut buddy whom I gave one of my screening tickets to knew all about. I leaned over to him at one point in the film and said, 'WTF was that all about.' And then after the film he explained the scene to me and I said, 'Well heck, who is going to know what that meant other than you and Sheldon Cooper? I kind of felt the same way with Watchman. If you have never read the graphic novel (me) it may seem a little hard to follow.I am not a Zack Snyder fan, I am not a Henry Cavil fan, I am a huge Ben Affleck fan as a director, as an actor, he is decent, and he did a decent job in the role of Batman. He is no Christian Bale, but he plays Batman every bit as dark and brooding. I think this Zack Snyder's best film, but to me that is not saying much. I am much more a DC fan than a Marvel fan, so I look forward to the several DC films that are about to be released, and this sets up the Justice League films well.I am very surprised at the tepid reviews, but the first hour was extremely disjointed and just odd and choppy. The best part of the film was Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. Perhaps the distant second to Heath Ledger as best comic book villain of all time. But Suicide Squad is out soon, so his reign on the number two throne may be short lived.If you have been in a comic book store more than 3 times in the last year you will likely give this film a ten. All the rest of us may not be quite as enthused.",8,37,71,22 March 2016
The Sixth Sense," Good old fashioned atmosphere
","We have all become so jaded with special effects and explosion a minute blockbusters that we often become restless with brilliant conventions that were used to shock us in films of the past.  These films now seem 'dated'. When thinking about the thrills in 'The Sixth Sense'.I am reminded somewhat of Hitchcock as I write this on the eve of the great one's one hundredth birthday.  But I think even more of a little known classic film,Roman Polanski's 'Repulsion'.  In it Catherine Deneuve plays a woman who is repulsed by men.  She spends a good thirty to forty minutes in virtual silence drifting into insanity, so that by the time things begin to go bump in the night the viewer is jumping out of their seat. Those who criticize the slowness of this films exposition don't seem to realize how important it is to provide the latter thrills.  But almost every reviewer agrees that the ending is terrific.  I gave this film an eight overall, but I will say that even though I've rated a lot of films with 9's and even 10's over the last few years, it is the only film of late that I truly plan to enjoy a second time. With a much different perspective I might add.",9,0,0,12 August 1999
Pitch Perfect," It has been years since I have seen a movie that I had such low expectations for...
","That I loved so much. I scored free tickets to a Denver Screening awhile back and was just going to have my wife and 13 year old daughter go , but I watched the trailer and really thought Anna Kendrick was terrific in 50/50 and very good in Up in the Air so I thought, what the heck, I'm going too. Was I glad that I did. I laughed like crazy and loved the a capella singing. This film is really raunchy and just skirts around an R rating several times, but it is just so fun.I am pretty confident that it is going to be the surprise box office hit of the fall and it is so much better than the films that it is bound to be compared to like Mean Girls, Bring it On, and even Bridesmaids. Speaking of Bridesmaids Rebel Wilson almost steals the show with every scene that she is involved with being hilarious, and in a lesser movie her scenes most certainly would be worth paying the price of admission alone, but there are so many other talents involved. Elizabeth Banks has never been funnier. Skylar Astin as the love interest is also terrific though he needs to change his name, because for me the name Skylar brings only one thing to mind and she is married to Walter White.This is no Oscar Winner, I am certain that I will see a dozen or so better movies this year, but none will having me laughing and smiling as much.",8,133,198,15 September 2012
50_50," Certain to capture a slew of Oscar Nominations
","I thought this was a better film than 'The King's Speech' or 'Social Network' my two favorite films of last year. Nothing this year has come close so far to the sheer brilliance of 50/50. It is the best 'disease of the week' film ever made, which sounds like a backhanded compliment but I don't know how to describe the genre any better.I have always felt that Gordon-Levitt along with Gosling are far and away the two best young actors working today. I thought that Gordon-Levitt deserved an Oscar nomination for 'The Lookout' but knew that was never going to happen. This is his time. His performance as a young man battling cancer is pitch perfect. You will laugh and cry along with him throughout his difficult journey. His best scenes are with his therapist played by Anna Kendrick. She was good in the overrated 'Up in the Air'; she is great in this film, playing another neophyte in a high powered career. She will be nominated as well, no doubt.Seth Rogan has the role of his career thanks in part to Will Reiser, the screenwriter, who was able to take the whole sexist, slacker, pothead thing that Rogan does and add a dimension of humanity. I think both of them also deserve Oscar nominations. Because of the nature of his role I would be surprised if Rogan gets one, but not too surprised. He is just hilarious and at times very touching.Finally we come to Jonathan Levine, a director that I had never heard of prior to this film. He is fantastic with actors here and has a great style. I say he is a shoo in come Oscar time.Now this review has really centered around Oscar and that is for a reason. It will not be released for awhile and I was lucky to see a preview screening in Denver last night. I could think of no other way to get the point across more clearly that this is a brilliant film that you must run to when it is released.One more thing. I made the mistake of taking my 13 year old daughter thinking the R rating was more about the pot and the language, and that the message of the film would overcome those issues. I kind of regret it. I really don't mind her having seen the film in an overall context because the message is terrific, but man was it raunchy and uncomfortable to sit through with her.",10,160,217,17 August 2011
Pineapple Express," Pineapple smokes all other stoner films
","Ever since Cheech and Chong appeared in 'Up In Smoke' the stoner film has become a staple of American Cinema. I have enjoyed them since day one. Last night, I was privileged to see an advance screening of Apatow's funniest film to date by far, and I really enjoyed all his other films. The audience and I were laughing so hard that I need to see it again to pick up on the jokes that I missed. It has been a long time since I have seen a stoner film stoned, but I may have to make an exception the second time around.I believe that when Apatow, Rogen, and Goldberg decided to write Pineapple Express they wanted to create the Lawrence of Arabia of stoner flicks,and they succeeded. Pineapple Express is the stoner film that has reset the bar for stoner films, just like The Dark Knight has reset the bar for comic book films. James Franco's Saul Silver who just deals drugs to pay for his Boobie's nursing home (He plans to become a civil engineer and be able to build toilets for kids in public parks.) is the greatest stoner character of all time. He has dethroned Sean Penn's Spicoli character after over 25 years of holding the honor of Celluloid stoner king.I don't want to ruin any of the jokes for you, but I am pretty sure every teen and college male in America will be quoting dozens of lines from the film within weeks and spoiling it for the main intended demographic, so I say go opening weekend before your buddy who saw it the day before starts spouting some of the films best lines.I had one minor quibble with the story in that at one point Saul sells pot to some pretty young kids and there is a funny bit built around that, but I wish they had at least chosen seniors in high school or something for that scene. I believe pot is less harmful than alcohol, tobacco, and of course all other illegal drugs, but that was just a bit too young for me.Anyway minor quibbles aside, Pineapple Express is one of the funniest comedies ever made, and undisputed king of the stoner flicks.",10,84,162,18 July 2008
Sin City," A fascinating mix of pure brilliance and absolute mediocrity
","I have not read Frank Miller's 'graphic novels', though after seeing Sin City it is obvious that Robert Rodriguez used Miller's frames as a verbatim story board. The result is mixed. I understand that the dialog is supposed to be cheesy and noirish to go with the brilliant visuals, but at times the whole thing was just way too over the top for my tastes. Never have I seen a more gory film, though the presentation is so unique that the disgust level is minimal. Mickey Rourke's performance is Oscar worthy. Jessica Alba's performance is not Oscar worthy, but one that no male will forget soon. It is nowhere near a classic, but a fascinating experiment definitely worth seeing.",8,0,3,3 April 2005
Hacksaw Ridge," A triumph for Gibson
","No matter what you think about Gibson, and I don't think much of him as a man. He is an elite director. There is a unique genius in how he handles this film. I hope this does not constitute spoilers, I don't think it really does, but the battlefield scenes are the most harrowing I have ever seen. There is nothing left to the imagination with shock after visceral shock coming at you for a good twenty minutes. The effect is an adrenaline surge as you feel like you are trying to survive with Doss and the rest of his troop. The payoff occurs after Doss does what he does and comes off Hacksaw Ridge. It is so emotional. The effect is amazing and it is all steered by Gibson's intense direction. You may even think, oh God, this is just too much, as you are watching the battles unfold, but it all results in a unique payoff.I like Garfield . He is a bit too goofy at the start and I feel like his hairdo makes him look more like the lead guitarist from the Spiders From Mars than a WWII hero. But once he gets in uniform his character really develops. Vince Vaughn seemed to love chewing the scenery as the Sarge, and Teresa Palmer was also solid.As an agnostic, there was one scene at the end that I felt was a little over the top, but the religious angle is handled beautifully and the power of faith is a great lesson for anyone. This is going to be a real crowd pleaser, but it is decidedly not a family film despite the theme. It is the most violent film that I have ever seen.",9,24,46,26 October 2016
The Social Network," Terrific and Thought Provoking
","With 10 films up for Best Picture these days I think it is a pretty safe bet that it will get a nod, but back in the days of 5 nominees I would really doubt it unless the winter crop of Oscar Contenders is a big disappointment. Personally the only two films that I have seen this year that I enjoyed more were Inception and Animal Kingdom ( I have not yet seen the Town.), but as I said before I expect to see several more terrific films during the next 4 months.I am not a huge Fincher fan. I have liked every single one of his films. I have loved none of them. This is now my favorite Fincher film. Since Zodiac he has really made fantastic looking films, and this continues that trend. Panic Room was my favorite film of his prior to this, though I am sure I am in a minority there.Eisenberg should really got nominated. I haven't a clue if he can win, but he was brilliant. Every little nuanced scene he shined in. I really believed his character. It truly is his film.I would like to see Andrew Garfield nominated for Best Supporting Actor as well. He is one of those guys that I know that I have seen in a few things to date, but I have never found him memorable. However; he does a wonderful job here and this should give his career a big boost.I have always been surprised at how solid Justin Timberlake has been in his films to date, and he does a great job here too. Not as strong as either Garfield or Eisenberg though.The screenplay by Sorkin was rock solid and will certainly get a nomination. You have to wonder how a story about Facebook is going to translate to the screen. The answer with all the talent involved is brilliantly.The movie opens a sort of Tarantino type restaurant scene with Eisenberg and a girlfriend, prior to the credits. It sets the tone for the Zuckenberg character and lets the audience know that they are in for a fascinating ride.One of the great successes of the film is to cause one to ponder just what an impact social networking has had on our society. It really has changed the way people interact with one another. And it is subtle but powerful. In my opinion as a man who lived through the last cultural upheaval (Hippies and Vietnam), this is not for the better.One last thing I must mention. There are a very important set of twins in the story, and I thought these guys are really good. I wonder what else they have done. I was totally blown away when I found out that the two guys who played the twins are not even related in real life. I mean they looked exactly alike.A lot of humor and a fascinating story. I love a good character study and this was certainly rock solid in that category.",9,9,21,24 September 2010
The Great Gatsby," Only the second film that I have ever seen that must be viewed in 3-D
","I could not imagine watching Hugo in 2-D. I did not care much for it in 3D frankly but it was a superb use of the medium. For me 3-D has been disappointing more often than not, that includes Avatar and a host of Comic book films that I have seen plus a handful of animated films, though I also feel 'How to Train Your Dragon' was certainly worth the extra few bucks for 3-D. So that is it out of a couple dozen films that I have paid to see in 3-D this is only the third one that was really worth the extra price. And truthfully, seeing 'How to Train Your Dragon' in 2-d would be almost as good as in 3-d.I am also not Baz Lurhmann's biggest fan having felt Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet were quite mediocre. I really enjoyed Australia though (I know I am in the minority on that one.)I guess I am glad this film has opened to some mediocre reviews because I didn't have the greatest of expectations, but it was a wonderful film. Starting with the spectacular visuals. I tell you I think I would have enjoyed the film with no sound just to watch it as a moving canvas. But the sound was almost as phenomenal. I am an old guy. The idea of Jay-Z doing the Soundtrack for a classic novel was underwhelming at best to me, but I was happily surprised by the beautiful soundtrack throughout. I enjoyed every note. It also helped tie in the themes of the novel with the excesses of our present society.I am a huge Leo DeCaprio fan and once again he gave a great performance. This was Joel Edgerton's best role besides maybe 'Animal Kingdom' which is a real favorite film of mine. He does a sort of Gable impression as Tom Buchanan but it really works. Carey Mulligan was surprisingly strong as Daisy. My one disappointment may have been Tobey McGuire. I normally really like him as an actor but here he doesn't really deliver as Nick. In my mind, there is no great logical progression to the character that he has become in the first scene as he flashes back and tells the Gatsby story. An extra bonus is that my daughter is planning to read the novel now. She reads a lot, but has avoided most classics. I loved the novel when I was a teenager, I am glad the film pointed her to the book. My daughter is 14 now, so I am not seeing as many animated films as I did a few years back. Maybe 3-D has been used well in some more recent animated films, but I don't miss any Marvel or DC filmsTrust me, if you plan to see this film, and you really should, do yourself a favor and see it in 3-D. It is breathtakingly beautiful.",9,10,20,10 May 2013
