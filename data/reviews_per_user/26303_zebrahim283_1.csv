Moneyball," Okay.....not great
","'Well?'...that's what I asked myself after watching this average affair. I failed to connect with Brad Pitt in this movie. The whole story lends heavily from other similar 'manager under pressure' releases. Certainly okay...never great. The dialog between the whizz Kidd and Pitt remain sterile, however the often static response from Brad Pitt to the goings on around him left me wondering if the character on which the movie is based was really this pathetic. I certainly found the support actors adequate...the ending left me wanting more and the whole lack of scenery sometimes made me feel like I was watching CUBE.I sincerely hope Pitt can return to form before his rumored early exit from actingTry it on a Sunday...",6,3,4,20 December 2011
