Skyfall," A wonderful turn of the series
","After Quantum of Solace people behind the Bond franchise probably found themselves at the crossroads – where to go and what to do next? Shall we chase Mr. White and his Quantum or do something else entirely; perhaps going back to Bond's roots would be more successful strategy? After all, Bond's got his heart completely crushed and had some kind of revenge, isn't it time to get a bit light about everything that happens to him? The decision of filmmakers presents itself this year as Skyfall, a most wonderful 180 degree turn of the film series.In my opinion, this is a beautiful and playful reload of the reload Bond film experienced since the coming of Daniel Craig. Skyfall adopts careless mood of the pre-Craig era with as many bows to the fans and various fetishes of the series: Q and his catchphrases, Miss Moneypenny, Aston Martin with guns under the hood, physically defective villain, frightening with his ambiguity and offering Bond a traditional game; and M, of course.Bond in his family house, wearing a kind of cardigan and with a rifle reminds of an aristocrat out hunting, a likely symbol of good-old England, the empire spreading good and fighting evil. Not only Bond deals with his childhood trauma by burning down the house, the filmmakers mark their return to the traditional values of Bond film series, and to the black-and-white vision of good people and bad guys. Thus also constant collision of black and white in the film (e.g. at the hearing scene: M is the blonde wearing black, Prime Minster is a brunette in light clothes, Severine has lighter complexion comparing to Moneypenny but they wear contrasting to their skin color dresses, black silhouettes fighting against bright neon lights , etc.) However blurred and shadowy the villain appears both on screen and in the descriptions of characters, no more villains with inner conflict, as it is clear who is bad and what is good and how to act.At the same time the characters are symbolically discussing the problems of their creators: who is better – the old guy or the young spotty kid, should we stop the bleeding and how safe do we feel with our new approach to security (or – Bond). Being old and young, experienced and innovative, end and start, leaving and carrying on are constantly being talked about, with the formula finally announced – old dog with new tricks. A wonderful combination, I find.Having suffered enough, Bond enjoys both his weakness and strength, is drinking and looking good, in tuxedo as well as in tight jeans, and finally is not taking the beautiful girls seriously. Well done, Bond, never thought you could after two previous films! Only one question remains – what next? Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace were great and interesting with their attempt at fashionable seriousness, are we going back to the ridiculous again? To the invisible cars and exploding pens? Will the filmmakers be able to balance newfound playful mood against some kind of credibility, find a worthy story, an interesting mission and a matching villain? What an intrigue! Can't help but wait the return of Bond, James Bond.",10,43,86,25 October 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Good Travel
","Why did I see the Star Trek' 2009 in the first place is – I really liked the way Carl Urban moved his jaw in 'Dredd' and got interested in his filmography. And he was good in the part of mean doctor Bones and I got to love the movie as well, not actually being the fan of the series or of any previous films. I loved it for its characters, its heart, its humor and intense action. Authors, do some more! And they did, though a bit differently this time. The following simile came to my mind: the 2009 film is a flower-chocolates period of a romantic relationship, when there's love, lightness and energy, but the future is yet unclear. Whereas 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is the family-life alright, with habits and fights (see Spock and Uhura), but with solidity and profoundness. I think this is right, because one cannot jump around and just be funny for long, there must be seriousness and growth, etc.Thus we have the film about Kirk's growing up, while traveling from attack to negotiation, from being reckless to being responsible, from empty foolhardiness to personal heroism. And he did surpass his heroic Dad, got reborn and his dream came true. Hooray! J.J. Abrams having successfully expanded Star Trek fan base the last time, now is humoring, I think, the hardcore fans of the series, hence the multiple moral dilemmas, the uneasy decisions and heavy pathos of the ending.There could be a little less action and the mentioned pathos and there could be a little more of the arrogant, tragically controversial figure of Khan (absolutely lovely in his ugliness Benedict C.), otherwise the film is perfect! Do some more, J.J., and may the Force be with you on Star Wars!",10,8,24,10 May 2013
