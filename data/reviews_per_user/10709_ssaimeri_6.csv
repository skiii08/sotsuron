The Lobster," What a rare way to display an idea on social conformity
","The LobsterWhat a rare way to display an idea on social acceptance. A near or distant future, depending on how you view our civilizations trajectory, clues us in to the societal norms that could develop given circumstance and instance.The story follows the life of David, (Colin Farrell) a man who has recently been rejected by his partner of 11 years and one month. In this dystopian version of life people who are single or cast out of relationships must follow protocol in order to regain the right to live within society again. In this world the main function of society is to create pairs, for if you have a partner you can better understand how life is supposed to be lived, or so the thinking is thought.Once cast out of a relationship, or once one is found to be single they are directed to the hotel. At the hotel you have 45 days to either find a mate or, given the circumstance that you find no mate, decide what kind of animal you want to be transformed into.David and the people that interact within the film speak purportedly and with an indifference matched only by artificial intelligence. To show emotion is adverse or unnecessary, depending on which negative branch you believe in, in utilizing the process of matchmaking. See in order for a relationship to be built there has to be a common ground that both can stand upon. For instance near sightedness, a limp, or perhaps the same hair type are all reason enough for a pair to match.David shows emotion rarely throughout the film but is one of the only characters that show any emotion at all. Traversing the halls of the cursed hotel he figures out what he doesn't want to know and how escape might become possible.But once escape is achieved what else can there be?",7,0,2,14 December 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Unexpectedly expected variety of variation
","Rogue OneImagine all that you loved about the original star wars saga, hold that, now throw it into the corner of your mind where fond memories are stored. Next open your eyes to a new Star Wars world and a fresh beginning. Imagine there is a movie screen in this new Star world and Rogue One is the picture that is playing on a 24-hour cycle.I had no idea that Rogue One was coming and it was so unexpectedly beautiful. I was imagining the same story line plus a new villain perhaps and contributory cast of 3 or 4 new faces. Wrong. So much more.The movie was so entirely separate from what you might've expected that you might not even wonder if this were the same story arc, but it is, rest assured you freaks. While the story line and characters introduced are exceptionally unique there are still the familiar bugaboos of Star Wars past. You still have your fleet battles you still have your monsters of incongruous proportions. It is everything you love about Star Wars and more and more.The plot of Rogue One follows an original story arc in the Star Wars bible that has been added to and edited for the past 40 years.You're going to appreciate this movie. One hundo p, guarantee.",8,2,8,21 December 2016
The Great Dictator," A Cornerstone of Film
","A movie that transcends generations and yet is particular to it's own. Conceived in a time just before some of the most acclaimed atrocities of human history it encapsulates a wonderful, modernistic mentality. A mentality that says it is sometimes necessary to make light of a dark character, so that people may pierce through the veil that shrouds the man in mystery, awe and fear. And this is something that Mr. Charlie Chaplin does exceptionally well while at the same time making us chuckle at his natural slapstick humor that he brings to all of his pictures. This movie is one of the most important in film history and not only because it set the precedent for future film makers. It is important because it promotes an ideal outside of its time. One of equality and of acceptance. Bravo Mr. Chaplin",8,2,4,7 July 2015
Amadeus," I absolve you all.
","I absolve you all.Man and his request for glory often go unanswered. So it is for Salieri, so it is for all of us disciplined in mediocrity.Amadeus lets us understand the great composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart with a familiarity I never imagined possible. He was but a man, a man like you or I, a man of uncultured talent. And when I say uncultured I frame it in the highest regard. For the man without culture, the man who receives the people's love despite this has created his own and that cannot be touched.To hear his work is to hear the voice of God whomever that may be.",8,0,1,9 February 2017
Ex Machina," Just think, a woman of your dreams come into your life only to turn it into a nightmare.
","Think of that woman, the one that haunts your dreams. Now imagine her come to life and into yours, seemingly fleshing out your dream all the while turning it into a nightmare.Most everything that you see in Ex Machina is something that you would expect to in a movie centering on Artificial Intelligence. You have the young genius responsible., the A.I. itself, and the third party that creates a variable situation.Oscar Isaac who plays the genius acts so well you never seem to notice that his character changes from movie to movie. From one instance he's a pilot, next he's a demigod, and in this movie he is a glorified programmer. Domnhall Gleeson plays the part of the exceptionally uninteresting talent and Alicia Vikander steals the show with her Audrey Hepburnesque voice quality and facial complextitions.A billionaire times three, Isaac, has made all the money he needs to take on his new initiative, creating life. In a sense Isaac has taken it upon himself to be the catalyst in A.I. reclamation.The story begins and ends at the compound where she is created. The story goes up the story goes down it even has a twist. But the major takeaway of this film is the very real possibilities that are in line with the plot and perhaps our future.",8,0,4,3 March 2017
Pride & Prejudice," perspective of one who did not read the book.
","Pride and Prejudice. Counted as one of the literary classics of British literature, and for good reason. A story built on the premises of social class, pride and love this movie follows the paths of Elizabeth and Jane Bennett on their journey to find what they're looking for. Along the way the two are befallen by their faults, resulting in sadness and a sense of uncertainty in one's chances of ever deserving what they want. But in this tale of love and woe, certain wrongs are righted and rash words are forgiven. Fore what can compare to the love these girls deserve and the love that they have to offer. It is as true a story as one can watch with an ending that could be compared to the greatest love stories of history.",8,0,0,10 September 2014
