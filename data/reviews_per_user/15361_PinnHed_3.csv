The Blair Witch Project," Disappointed by the OverHype; Stop Reading and go to this movie without knowing too much
","This film was an engaging and creepy take on a unique approach to storytelling.  Set-up a scary situation, and let the audience interpret. Tell me this, does anyone remember a movie with more black screen (sound-only) that you paid undeterred attention to? However, I went in anticipating throat-tightening fear, I experienced a few chills.  BLAME IT ON THE HYPE MACHINE!!!  IF YOU HAVE OT SEEN THIS MOVIE, STOP READING ANY OF THIS.  Just go see the movie, you'll have a more chilling experience.  I will say the finale creeped me out...in a big way.  But, only because I had previously seen the 'Sci.-Fi.' Channel Mockumentary.  That was super-creepy. My recpmmendation to the viewing audience, watch this documentary on Sci-Fi., THEN go see the movie.  Talk about setting up a scary, scary premise.  I lived in Maryland for five years, and those backwoods offer enough interesting locals to scare you nonetheless a Witch.  My anticipation is the D.V.D. will include/assimilate the Sci.-Fi. documentary...then watch. After that documentary, my skin crawled...then I read too much about this movie.  It definitely took away from the experience.",Null,0,1,31 July 1999
Fight Club," In a Utopia, 'South Park' vs. 'Fight Club' for the Oscar
","Mr. Fincher, Congratulations on another coup de gras that undoubtedly takes Hollywood by storm, and raises the blood pressure of the P.C. crowd.  I can not comment on the truth to the novel as I have not read it.  But the version I witnessed was mesmerizing.  The two leads, ironically considered two of Hollywood's leading 'Pretty Boys' turn in gritty, adept performances that certainly don't ring of 'Pretty Boy'.  Helena Bonham Carter proves she'll do what a role calls for.  The remainder of the prominent cast, in their small but important roles provide the necessary gung-ho to make this movie fly. If they remade 'Terminal Man', they'd call it 'Fight Club'.  As Brad Pitt calls in the trailer, 'Fight Club' takes it up a notch.  Those who criticize this movie for it's 'brutality, glorification of violence, love of pain' are, I'm sure, the same individuals who looked the other way during 'Private Ryan'.  The violence in this movie is pervasive and graphic.  It is not, however, gratutitous or unnecessary.  It sets a tone.  Think 'Clockwork Orange'.  The plot was NOT predictable, thereby thwarting the normal Hollywood method.  I felt like I was watching the European 'The Vanishing' when it all played out.  And it made me smile and wince.  Smile at the surprise, wince at the gripping story.  Obviously, I thouroughly enjoyed this movie.  And it is not often I think how I can't wait to see it again. To see how the director and cast obviously tipped their hand, and still left me in the dark.",Null,2,6,18 October 1999
American History X," A well-portrayed expose of hate. And remorse.
","This is one of those movies that begs your average moviegoer to hate it. Hate it for violence, for racism, for brutality.  The truth is, this movie would do more to abrogate racism, brutality, and (maybe) violence if it were shown more widely.  Edward Norton proves he is not interested in being a pretty boy, but an actor.  Edward Furlong continues to remind us all he's more than that effeminate kid from T2.  For those of us old enough to remember the birth of skinheads, this movie portrayed their hateful, baseless stance head-on.  If you were ever thrown in a moshpit at a Suicidal Tendencies show, you know how you were kicked.  By the biggest group of losers in town.  Until they found Derek Vinyard and felt vindicated. However, this movie turns around and displays the other side.  The mindless quest to be a gangsta.  Without concern.  The only downside of this movie is the preachiness which was understandable but overblown.  The generational influences in this movie are brilliant.  From Dad, to brother, to little brother, hate begets hate.  An excellent movie, with balls that movies like 'Colors' would have benefited from.",9,0,0,21 May 1999
