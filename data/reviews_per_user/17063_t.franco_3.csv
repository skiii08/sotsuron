Marie Antoinette," Good movie, better than I expected. From a MA loyal admirer
","Marie Antoinette (MA) is one of my favorite characters in world history. I have read practically all the biographies and have watched the very few movies made about this tragic Queen. I had not many expectations when I purchased this DVD since I thought it was going to be full of historical errors (like the 1938 movie) and silly clich√©s as always happens in most US-made movies. But to my surprise, I became engaged with it right from the very beginning. I think Kirsten did a nice and decent job although I wasn't too impressed by the role played by Jason as Louis XVI. I loved the music, the visuals and the auditory elements. Sophie showed us just a small part of MA's life and character, but I liked what I saw. Of course I would have loved to see this movie covering MA during the French revolution; for instance, covering events such as the flight to Varennes, her imprisonment in the Temple Tower and later, in the Consiergerie, and her famous trial and tragic end in the scaffold. Her role in those events was what made MA a legend and immortal, not the frivolous life the movie portrayed. But the movie was good I must say and I would see it again. I gave it a 8.",8,2,4,14 March 2007
Pearl Harbor," It wasn't that bad
","I think it wasn't that bad. I was expecting an awful movie because of the comments found in this database. Before I walked in the cinema I was worried about the love story because I hate when movie makers insert stupid love stories into would-be good movies. I think the love story in the Titanic was more stupid than the one on Pearl Harbor. I hated the love story in the Titanic, I think it was very silly.I enjoyed Pear Harbor despite all the negative comments I have read before. I was ready to leave the cinema if the movie became unbearable but instead I found myself enjoying it. The action part, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, was fantastic and very real. As I said, the love story was bearable but I hated the scene when this couple make love at the air base. That was really an stupid setting for making love, specially totally naked. Definitely this movie won't be nominated for the Oscars. I think the director lost a great opportunity to make a better movie with all that money. I gave a score of 7 to this movie.",7,0,1,10 July 2001
The Godfather," The very best movie of all times
","I can't really describe accurately  how I feel about this movie. I have seen it so many times and every time I have enjoyed it more than the previous one. The plot, the music, the actors and actresses couldn't have played better roles. This movie was even better than the book which rarely happens in with other movies. No wonder why it movie has been ranked first.",9,1,2,2 April 2002
