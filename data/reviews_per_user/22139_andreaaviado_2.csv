The Lobster," The Lobster is going to be one of those memorable films for me which, I will never forget because of its uniqueness and twists.
","Let me first start this review with the reason why I watched the film. I was mainly persuaded to see this movie because I was struck by the uniqueness of its concept. I actually saw this title in a Facebook page's list of recommended films to watch and upon reading its concept, I instantly became interested with it. And as early as now, I am saying that the film did not disappoint me. Frankly, upon seeing the opening scene, I did not have an idea on what the movie is going to be and I really love the fact that the story did not give hints on how it is going to end. In addition, I love how the writer incorporated symbolism in the story. The film also reminds me of some Wes Anderson films as I have noticed in some of the movie's shots, framing and direction. However, I can definitely say that director has his own style making his craft. I was also impressed with the film's production design. I love how the details really make the world of the film a kind of reality to the eyes of an audience like me. I also commend the actors' portrayal in the film. The Lobster is going to be one of those memorable films for me which, I will never forget because of its uniqueness and twists.",7,0,2,29 October 2016
La La Land," An epitome of good storytelling.
","La La Land is an epitome of good storytelling. There isn't anything unique about the story itself but the way on how it was told to the audience is what made this movie stand out among the others. The director must be so proud for turning his vision of the story into picture because, personally, I really did appreciate it --a lot. Partnered with great cinematography, awesome soundtrack, superb transitions, funny dialogues and nice acting with some singing and dancing --I can say that this film is a definition of entertainment. Kudos to the production team for delivering such an above-average film.Nonetheless, one of the issues that I noticed in the film is the flow of the story. I really like how the writer gradually introduced and built the characters and their world in the beginning, however, when the movie was nearing its conclusion, I found the flow faster compared at the beginning which caught me off guard that the movie is about to end. In addition, I am not really a fan of how the story ended but is of the film's ending. I really like how the filmmakers depicted the story if things went the other way around --a style I've always wanted to try. Moreover, I am also not a fan of the film's scenes wherein the character's background fade into black and a spotlight focuses on the actor. Personally, I find this style and aesthetic amusing in crucial scenes but is not in those which I perceive as not that relevant since this decreased the depth of the message.Generally, La La Land is one of those movies which made me leave the theater with a smile on my face. What made the movie remarkable for me and for most people probably, is its depiction of life embodied into two distinct characters that most people can easily relate to. Personally, I have seen myself in some of Emma's scenes portraying Mia. I'm really glad that I did not waste my time and money seeing this film.",8,2,5,23 January 2017
