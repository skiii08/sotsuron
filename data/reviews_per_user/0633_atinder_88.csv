The Blair Witch Project," Not fan of this one!
","A lot people still believe this was first Found footage which took the nation by storm.There are older movies like The Last Broadcast (1998), which was made year before this and also Alien Alien Abduction: Incident in Lake County (1998) it's actually started in 80's with Cannibal Holocaust (1980).I seen many of found footage movies, they just keeping coming, a least it better then lame remake.I was not Big fan of this movie at all, I found the movie really dull and boring and it did not creep me out at all, I just found most of the movie really annoying and it didn't not help with actors.I didn't really understand the ending at first, I had to give another watch to understand the ending, I did like the stories at start of the movie was really in-trusting.4 out of 10",4,1,1,20 April 2012
Insidious: Chapter 2," Decent sequel could have been better
","didn't mind the first movie, I didn't think it all that great but I did enjoy the first half of the movie before the second have of the movie.Well this movie dose not fall in the same area, as the movie felt the kind of the same all from the start to the endI didn't really find it scary or creepy at all but I do think some of scare scenes were to bit random and a little to funny.Also what I did not about this movie. was that it had far to many funny moment, which takes away any of creepiness the movie had.There lot people in cinema (People as young as 6, who seating in front seat) was half packed room and I did not hear or see anyone jump but I did hear a lot of people laughing after the jokes. Well I heard some people clapping after ending of the movie but most people were annoyed with the ending.I going to give this movie the same ratting I gave the first movie 5/10",5,2,4,21 September 2013
The Avengers," I am Gutted that Didn't see this in cinema
","This movie was lot of fun to watch, I never seen the Captain America or Thor movies before. So there so-what knew to me.I liked the fact we had some time with each different superheros before come together. I really liked how the movie flowed , it not no-stop action all way thought.There were calmer scenes in this movie that i found interesting and they didn't drag on to long to make boring but action sequencing was outstanding.First time I have actually liked new Hulk (I was HUGE Huge fan of Old Hulk, i Have never given this Hulk a chance) Not fan Thor thought, I can't seem to be warn, I may need to see his movie next. see more his back story, same for Captain America.Those actions were edge of your seat stuff and lots of stuff going on at the same time. I hoping for better ending then this movie got, they all go on there separate way (For the own sequels lol) I looking forward to sequel, I wonder if they add other Superheros in the mix 8/10",8,1,6,22 February 2013
Alien 3," Worse in the series for sure!
","(I think this is a re-watch) I know I have seen some parts of the movie, I could not remember much of the movie. I thought the first was a decent movie, I don't think it great as it is made out to be.Aliens was okay sequel, when I re-watched it, I didn't enjoy it as much as the last time I watched it. Aliens, If you watch the series back to back, Soon as Alien 3 start its already lost some of th fans, as it's dose not make sense after second Alien movie. The plot was silly , I could not care about any of people in this movie,I actually hoped the Alien killed them of sooner, they were pain in the beep! The movie drags on for far to long and when Aliens scenes are far to apart, in this movie and even Alien scenes, it look a lot different in this movie then first two, it's didn't look as scary or creepy either. The deaths in scenes made me laugh out loud, there was so bad, the death were bloody but I still found it funny, I don't remember much blood from the first two movies. Some of the effects in this movie was really badly done as well, the acting was okay in tjos movie, I could really care less for one person in this movie.I was rooting for Alien. I was not to keen on how this movie ended, it was bit of a cop out 2 out of 10",2,0,4,22 January 2014
Gremlins," I love Gizmo
","I love this movie so much, i love seeing Gizmo, he dose cheer me up when I am in the blues.This movie is about Billy who get this creature from his dad from a antic store for Xmas present. Bily names the cute little Creature Gizmo, there 3 rules he need follow.1) He can't be in lights or sun light that would kill him. 2) Never get him wet. 3)Never feed him after Midnight.Then a friend of him comes over to seem him and then start playing with him and knocking of a glass with a bit of water in it that falls on Gizmo start shaking really badly and fur balls start jumping out of Gizmo back, which turn into more creatures and look a lot more Goofy then first Gizmo. Then billy falls a sleep for bit looking at clock (His unaware that creatures have chewing the wire on clock) and then he feed them after midnight.Turn in green big eggs, when they hatch that when the fun really start for the creatures and take over the town.This is great fun enjoyable movie for whole family to watch, the most of it is comedy that is bit of Drama in this movie with Billy Girlfriend who dose not like Xmas because something bad happened to family when she little girl on Xmas day, which is little sad. Yes it's A horror/comedy, I do think it's suitable for kids, my kids love this movie they both seen this movie 10 times by now. I seen it, well, I see it so many times I have lot count.Acting from the whole cast is great and creature effects were really outstanding.I going to give this a whooping 10 out of bloody 10 One reason I giving this movie 10 out of 10 is that Gizmo, why can't he be real!",10,1,3,2 January 2011
Lucky Number Slevin," VERY underrated
","When friend saw this movie, he did not like it, So didn't even bother seeing, This week I rented this movie and i can't believe what missed out on.The start of the movie is really shocking, as I didn't expect that so early in the movieThe story start in a covered waiting area of a bus terminal, a disturbed young man is approached by Goodkat (Bruce Willis), who tells the story of Max, a family man who bets borrowed money on a fixed horse race while his son waited in the car. when Max is being to death and not knowing to Max his wife and his son Henry are both about to get shot in different places. after telling the story Goodkat Kill him by breaking his Neck and puts him in the back of a truck.later Slevin (Who has just moved into Nick flat) is mistaken for Nick and gets kidnapped by two guys who work for The Boss. The Boss who is a powerful mafia tell Slevin to paid money or work with him and kill fairy, the homosexual son of rival Jewish mafia lord Schlomo The Rabbi the Boss's former partner supposedly responsible for murdering the Boss' son.As soon as he get to flat it not long until he gets kidnapped yet again buy another two men this time this two men who are working with The Rabbi and he also mistaken him for Nick as well and tell him to kill The Boss.I Can't tell you too much about this movie, it will ruin a lot good surprising twists in this movie.What I can tell you that I was not disappointed in this movie, twist and turns all are really well done and worked really well with the rest of the movie and everything make sense at the end of movie.Great cast and outstanding acting from everyone.9/10 Vey underrated movie",9,5,9,24 August 2009
Skyfall," That more like it
","And finally Skyfall (2012)Now that more like it , I really liked this one. It had the perfect balance of actions and calm scenes.The opening was great . Loved every second of that , great action stunts . Which I don't think were that over the top compared to the last movie I enjoyed the titles of the movie, I think song helped , it kinds reminded from old bond titlesThis was one of the longest bond movies however the movie flew by as I was so into movie .I did not once looked away from the screen for hour and half and finally got used to Daniel Craig playing James Bond, I thought he did much better . job .He was actually felt like he was playing bond in this movie , which seemed missing from last two movies Really good movie.I am going to give this a 7 out of 10",7,1,5,15 January 2015
The Ring," Not a bad remake
","Rachel Keller is a journalist investigating a videotape that may have killed four teenagers (including her niece). There is an urban legend about this tape: the viewer will die seven days after watching it.The first movie to ever scare the hell out of me was the Ringu (1998), it was the first horror movie, i brought on Video (DVD were not out then).This movie not as scary as the Ringu and i did like how they showed the face of the victims after there deaths, which we did not see in original movie. The acting was really good from the whole cast.I did like this ending better then the Ringu, but whole movie was no were near as good as the Ringu.",5,2,4,18 March 2010
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," magnificent
","This movie from stat to end is magnificent.A group of aliens visit earth and one of them is lost and left behind stranded on this planet. The alien is found by a 10 year old boy, Elliot. Soon the two begin to communicate, and start a different kind of friendship in which E.T learns about life on earth and Elliot learns about some new values for the true meaning of friendship.E.T The whole of the story is great, The Alien It self I just love it, How can you not love him, While you watching this movie you will be laughing, you will be crying and you will be on the edge of seat for the whole movie! When I first saw ET it did make me cry ( I Was 3 years old) and after 20 years still as great the first time I saw it, Steven Spielberg did tremendous Jobs on this movie with The Wirting, Every scenes was amazing with Special effects were JUST terrific and THE acting from Henry Thomas, Dee Wallace, Robert MacNaughton , Drew Barrymore were outstanding.Everything about this movie was just........ wait for it extraordinary",10,1,3,30 June 2009
This Is the End," Really funny movie.
","This is the End (2013)This is was really good and very funny movie, there some decent funny so-what gory death in this movie. Creatures will really well made and in way funny as well and I Just found the ending to little be odd and bit chesses but its kinda of works with the rest of the movie in the odd way.For me some jokes missed the mark, early on in the movie but I found most of the movie really funny, There was some dull scenes in between calmer scenes which I found a little dull.7 out of 10 really good",7,0,3,13 November 2013
Dawn of the Dead," This is not just one of the best remakes, its' one of best zombies movies ever made.
","I will of with the plot A re-envisioning of George Romero's apocalyptic horror classic, 'Dawn of the Dead': An unexplained plague has decimated the world's population--and yet, the dead aren't dying. They've become zombies, stalking endlessly in a quest to feed on the flesh and blood of the few remaining living. A ragtag group of desperate survivors in a Wisconsin town seek refuge in a large indoor mall, where they must learn not only to protect themselves from the ever-increasing zombie horde, but also to co-exist with each other as a last bastion of humanity. Sealed off from the rest of what used to be the world, the group uses every available resource, in their against-all-odds fight, to remain alive and human. I really like this remake as much as i liked the original back in 1978.In this remake unlike the original Dawn of the dead the zombies run in this movie, which work really well and makes it a lot more scary when the zombies attack. I didn't think this was more gory then the original Dawn of then dead but i did find the remake a bit more scary as Zombies did have really good make up effect. Acting was great from the cast and Zack Snyder did outstanding job on this remake.This is not just one of the best remakes, its' one of best zombies movies ever made. I going to give this 9/10 just like the original",9,0,1,23 January 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Underrated sequel, I think it was could as the second
","Alien: Resurrection (1997) I don't know how long I had this on DVD, I got the whole 4 box set on DVD but I never actually saw this before. I did hear nothing but bad comments on this movie, saying it was even worse then 3rd, So maybe that why I never actually sat down to watch It. I was actually really surprised with this movie, I found to very entertaining from start to end. This movie really didn't take to long to get started, the first two movies took some times and 3rd one took forever to get started. I found the plot a bit more intruding and I liked how the movie flowed, there were a lot of more Alien actions in this movie There some decent gory moments in this movie, which I really liked and liked how plot came to an end.I found the people in this more likable and yet I still felt sorry for the Alien too.6 out of 10, I rated this the same as the second one.",6,2,4,22 January 2014
Shaun of the Dead," Really Funny.
","i will start of with the plot: On Friday, Shaun is in a rut. At 29, he's coasted through life--and still hasn't gotten very far, usually winding up at the local pub, the Winchester. His roommate Ed looks up to him--when he can take his eyes off the TV, that is. Liz is re-evaluating their relationship, particularly after Shaun fails to do something special for their anniversary on Saturday. That day, there are train delays, people fainting in the streets, TV news reporters on unexplained calamities. No, it can't be--but it is--the dead have risen. Saturday's isolated incidents mushroom into a full-on zombie assault and, once daylight breaks, it's Sunday bloody Sunday. As manners and flesh take a beating, it's time to separate men from meat, humans from zombies, and living from undead. Shaun and Ed grab whatever is at hand to repel the attacking zombies, summoning reserves of strength they didn't know they possessed and straining muscles they forgot they had. Rounding up friends and family, they press on towards the sanctuary of the Winchester. All that stands in their way are hordes of the flesh-eating undead.This movie is not scary at all (like Braindead aka Dead Alive which is scary then this movie) but this movie did have some very gory scenes which i really like.This movie was absolutely hilarious! from start to end, there also added some drama in this movies not too much but mainly focused on the jokes. The zombies make up effect were really good and there was one of deaths scenes that really stood out and it's was really gory, which i really likedThe acting from Simon Pegg, Kate Ashfield, Nick Frost,Lucy Davis. Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton and the rest of the were greatI going to give this movie a 8 out 10",8,1,3,23 January 2010
Hostel," The sequel makes this movie a little better.
","When i first saw this movie back in 2005 , I hated this movie as I heard is was really great horror movies and few years later Hostel 2 come out which is even worse then this movie, I find the sequel to be really bad (I always watch movies twice, to see if I have missed anything the first time around) I was laughing from start to end of the movie, I think the sequel makes this a better movie. The plot Two adventurous American college buddies, Paxton and Josh, backpack through Europe eager to make quintessentially hazy travel memories with new friend Oli, an Icelander they've met along the way. Paxton and Josh are eventually lured by a fellow traveller to what's described as a nirvana for American backpackers--a particular hostel in an out-of-the-way Slovakian town stocked with Eastern European women as desperate as they are gorgeous. The two friends arrive and soon easily pair off with exotic beauties Natalya and Svetlana. In fact, too easily. Initially distracted by the good time they're having, the two Americans quickly find themselves trapped in an increasingly sinister situation that they will discover is as wide and as deep as the darkest, sickest recess of human nature itself--if they survive. This as so much nudity in this movie and it was not as gory as it was made out to be , I thinking it be like Gutterballs which has a lot nudity in that movie too but as really nasty gory scenes in that movie however this movie not as gory but then did have really nasty scenes that were really good. The acting was really good from the whole cast, it not the worst movie out there but not a great movie too. Since this has been on DVD it's as grown on me a lot and I gave this second watch also gave Hotel 2 a second I hate Hostel 2 a lot more then hated this movie back in 2005. I going give this movie 5 out 10",5,2,4,4 February 2010
Ted," it's not to be taken seriously the plot is about a talking bear!
","After seeing this trailer yesterday, I could not believe how funny this looked, as fan of Family Guy and Amecina dad, I Could not wait until Aug 1st last yearFirst half of the movie was very funny, i felt like i was laughing for 30 minutes no stop, there was really funny jokes, I love the Thunder songs, crack me up big time. After the first half hour the movie dose lose a steam and dose feel less funny, they do have some descent jokes that will make giggle for rest of the movie. I was hoping for full on comedy, I do think they put a tad too much drama in this movie, which made less funny, some might find some scene very sad. I Really enjoyed how the movie ended, I think was perfect ending to this movie.7 out of 10",7,0,3,12 November 2013
Spider-Man 2," Not bad sequel
","This is another re-watch, I wasn't to keen on it when I first saw, It seem this movie as gown on me over the past few years I really enjoyed it on second watch, I feel liked the fact that this movie had nice mixture of action and some very humourers moment in this movie. I did laugh a few times in this movie as i found some jokes really funny, it blended in really well with the action scenes. There were some really good action scenes in this movie, really well made, there were some action that did go little longer they should, those scene kind of took edge of it. I enjoyed most of the movie, I felt the ending was bit of let down, That really let the movie down. The acting was really good from the whole cast!",7,0,2,28 February 2013
The Others," This movie as Atmosphere with one hell of twist
","The movie start off with a mother with two kids, then strange things start happen in the house, the mother is a very religious tells the kids story about Limbo if they are acting really bad.There are one or two great moment in this movie, which are really creepy but not Scary at all However these scenes did have some really great Atmosphere.There are some few twists and turns in this movie, The twist at the end I did not seeing coming at all, I was total shocked when I first saw this movie.The acting from Nicole Kidman amazing as was the rest of the cast I am going to give this movie 8 out of 10",8,1,3,19 April 2010
Orphan," Good movie
","I did here a lot of good things about this movie, I missed this when it was in the cinema. I just got it on DVD this week.Now that i have seem it, I did not think it was great movie everyone said it was. that dose not mean it a crap movie, This movie was actually good.The plot Kate and John Coleman decides to adopt a child. When they meet the nine-year-old Russian girl, Esther, at the Orphanage, they immediately fall in love with the well-educated orphan.When Esther get to your home she get on really well with little sister Max who is hard-of hearing and can't speak but Daniel dose not seem to get long with her or even like but it not long after Kate soon start think the same as Daniel as Esther start to act a bit more different.This movie was really good and that Esther was one hell of little creepy girl and this movie as some great atmosphere for most of Esther scenes.The twist near the end was good but it didn't shock me as i sort of figured it out much early on in the movie, The ending of the movie was really poorly done.The acting from the all the kids were fantastic and rest of the cast were really good.I am going this movie 7 out of 10",7,2,4,12 March 2010
Spider-Man 3," My favourite of the series
","I seen this a least twice before, I loved it, when it first came out. I thought it was best of 3 at the time (I didn't like second one at that time) This movie a lot stuff hopping and there could have least done first half movie that could easily fitted in the second movie.I found this movie was trying to put way too much stuff in this movie, I loved it, I was like Give Spider-man a break This movie was really fasted past and Action packed and I don't think took my eyes of TV at all until the ending credits There action scene in this movie was very gripping to watch, really well made and not sure what make of the Series Twist at the end. 8 out of 10",8,3,4,28 February 2013

Scary Movie 2," The Exorcist spoof the best thing about this movie
","This not my favourite scary movie, i think it was the weakest of the four, This Cindy, Breada, shorty and ray (They did not really died in the first movie ) This movie spoofs The Haunting,What Lies Beneath, Poltergeist The Amityville Horror and Charlie's Angels This movie not as funny as scary movie one but opening sequence of the movie was outstanding, i loved The Exorcist spoof it great but after that I did not found that the rest of the movie funny, I did like the fighting cat, which kinda spoof bit of Pet Sematary also at the same time spoofs Rocky.Those two scenes are the one that made me laugh out loud it great to watch back to back with Scary movie.5/10",5,1,2,25 July 2009

","Final Destination is one of my favourite movie, i Loved it I did not get chance to see Final Destination 2 in the cinema but I wish I did now When I got this movie on DVD, I didn't think it be that good at all. but I was wrong with thatThis time it's Kim who going trip with her best friends as get to The Freeway she has premonitions of pile-up .Which is one of the most shocking, gruesome, action packed, explosive and edge of your seat., That pile-up scenes is one the best scene EVER made, it was magnificentKim saved from getting killed, Now death is back again to killed them off,the deaths in this movie are so much MORE gory then the one in Final destination, In most horror movies you just get Teenager, (Like Final Destination 3 which was full of teenagers) in this movie they had older cast which think was really good idea but The acting is not great but still good..I give this movie 10/10 pile-up scene just blew me away.",8,2,4,17 July 2009
Alien," As it's moment, not a classic in my book,
","Yet another re-watch,I have seen thia movie a few times now, I am not a big fan of this movie, Decent movie, I don't think it great as it is made out to be. Well the movie start of little tense first but it takes a while for anything to really kick in.You might say the wait is worth, with the Alien stomach scenes, which is one of best scenes in this series and of course one of the best horror/scfi scenes moments. The Alien it self was really well made, it was look great and very scary with those teeth.There were decent twist and turns in thisss movie, Which I really enjoyed.

The Bourne Ultimatum," The most entertaining of them all,
","The other two movies a great in series, I found this movie even more entertaining and bit confusing.Well start with first scene, I thought I miss something and a second i thought number 2 back in as they looked the same.I also a liked the fact that she more Nicky Parsons as she really under use in the last movie and was really great watch her in this movie, wanted her to live. The scene in this movie was amazing, I didn't think it could beat the fight scene in the second, he sure did. I love twist and turns and ending of seconding movie connected in this movie, was fantastic idea. I would of thought was end of second movie with that.This movie was Griping and I was actually sweating watching this movie, hoping to get away, the ending was of movie was the icing on the cake for 9 out of 10 Absolutely fantastic one the best trilogy out there.",9,0,1,26 December 2011

The Shining," This has to be the most overrated movie EVER
","This has to be the most overrated movie, This movie bored me to death every time I watch it.The summary of movie is about A novelist - Jack Torrance take a job interview as winter caretaker of the isolated, old, huge and beautiful Overlook Hotel. In the interview, Jack is told by the manager himself, that the previous caretaker - Grady, chopped his family and later killed himself with a shotgun. Ignoring the story, Jack brings his wife - Wendy and his son Danny . It happens that Danny, has a mysterious power known as 'The Shining' that shows him things from the past and future. Some of the visions come from Tony - 'the little boy who lives in Danny's mouth'. Danny meets Hallorann - the hotel cook in their first day arriving at the Overlook, who also has this 'Shining' and he warns him about the hotel and the sinister Room 237. As the days go by, Danny has visions of previous guests and employees who died at the hotel years before, meanwhile Jack starts driving into insanity, turning more and more aggressive, at the point that Danny and Wendy gets convinced that Jack might try to do the same thing.I have seen this movie 4/5 every time I watch it, I always seem to fall sleep after the only one good scary scene with the naked women in the bathtub, that is the only worth checking scene as nothing else in this movie scared me or creep ed me out.I have really tired to like this movie the more I watch (Or even here about ) it more I hate it!1st)) I didn't like â€“ Why? I was disappointed as it bored me.2nd) Wendy screaming did my head in for a least 2 day, I was wishing that Jack would chop her head off with the Axe, at least wouldn't have been boring.3rd) well fell sleep 10 seconds after hot naked women in bathtub.4th) I Just fast forward to the part with naked Ghost and then turn it offThis is not good adaptation at all and I think it one of worst Stephen kings adaptations it better to read book again and again and again and again.I Wish I could see what everyone else sees's in this movie.3/10",3,1,8,19 July 2009
Spider-Man," Great fun to watch with the whole family!
","I gave this another re-watch after seeing new re-boot. Well this movie didn't have much action the latest one and a lot more of story just scenes of fighting and flying. There were A lot of slow scenes in this movie, with some really good action sequences I do like some of story that taken away from this movie that wasn't in the re-boot. I didn't find this movie as dark as new one, Which I still do prefer Maguire as man. I felt like we connected a lot more in this story and cared about him (I can't say the same thing new spider-man) The Actions scenes in this movie was really good and very decent not over the top and don't drag for too long.The acting was really good from the whole cast. 7 out 10 really good movie",7,1,2,22 February 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," This movie felt like it missing half the story!
","As I saw Spider-man 3 not that long ago, that was still fresh in my mind, I still found this movie to early for a -Re-boot of the series.I didn't really like how this movie flowed, I think they could have done better Job of him discovering is powers, Instead of over the top Train scenes. I don't know if was meant to funny or not but I found that way to Silly and I didn't the fact that most of time,I didn't like the fact in had the mask off most of time and I didn't like how he got used to his powers so fast, I felt that the movie moved to fast, I didn't really care of Parker in this movie In the other series, I felt that Connect to Parker and felt that was lot more Developed and i found more Like-able then this one. The action scenes were good and fun watching but I found this movie focused way too much on Action instead of everything else. I didn't like the ending at all, it found really bland. I got some good thinks to say about this is that the acting this movie was really good from the whole cast and effect were really good in this movie as well. 6/10",6,1,6,22 February 2013
Aliens," More actions then first but not as good as the first
","I watched this series back to back I had this on in the background, while building work going on next door, it was really hard to stay focused in the movie. As I was partly watching this movie, I had seen this movie a few times before.Last time, I saw this, I found it better then the first, however, This time round, I found first to be more fun then this movie. also takes some times for anything to happen but when it gets gong, the actions never stops and I find the Aliens looked bit different in this movie. not in a bad way, it didn't look as scary as the first movie.Well still did look scary but decent effect however the ending was really predicable.Acting was great in this movie. 6 out of 10",6,0,1,17 January 2014
The Fast and the Furious," Decent start to series
","Everyone I know is raving on about the latest one in the cinema saying, it was best movie in series yet, few saying best movie of the year (There not seen Man of steel yet) and even my Brother seemed to like it, even thought it only seen fifth one before and none of early ones.The Fast and the Furious (2001)Brian O'Connor who's under cover cop and be come a little to close to Dominic Toretto and as he trusted him Brian then falls for is sister but soon caught out other people in grew.This movie was a lot fun to watch, some great race scenes in this movie and the acting was really good from the whole cast! This is a lot of fun, some great car race scenes in this movie Decent start to series 6 out of 10 good movie",6,0,4,24 July 2013
The Exorcist," Outstanding acting what makes this movie more chilling
","I lost count of how many times i have seen this movie, It loses some impact, if watch too often,I Can see why a lot people find this movie scary (Also can see why some people don't find that scary), it dose have some scary moment in this movie, there some scenes that will creepy you out, Like head spin (Which I found little funny) and stab-ing scenes, some may find hard to watch.The make up effect makes were good, she looked scary as hell.Linda Blair who played Regan MacNeil was absolutely amazing in this movie, the way she acted in this movie, felt like it actually happened to her, made it so real.Over the years there as be so many Exorcist movies, not one of them made look as realistic as this movie,",9,1,2,31 October 2012

Amanda puts a necklace gadget full of explosives around Dr. Lynn's neck connected to John Kramer's life support system, and tells her that if he dies the device will explode. Meanwhile, Jeff is submitted to a sick game of forgiveness with surprising dark consequences.There is a lot more drama in this, then the previous two, there is a lot more gory deaths as well, it has Some really nasty deaths scenes in this with some cool traps. (Small Spoiler) There is one death scene, which did make me look away as it had got a lot of broken bones in that scene, I just can not watch broken bones. The acting was so much better then the last two , the whole cast was really good. The endind was really good, it's a shame they carried the series on, as this would have been a perfect ending to the series. (As I find this perfect ending to series. I going give this movie 7 out of 10",7,1,3,9 February 2010

","When i first saw this movie a few years ago, i had no what it was about as it recommend by a Friend.I found this movie to be new and original something fresh for horror/thriller genre and this movie is one of a kind.This movie as one plot you need to play full attentions, if you miss second of this movie you will lost and confused what the hell is going on as there so many twist and turns in story then a twister!The acting in this movie was really good, acting from whole cast was great, even the flashback scenes with kids were really good in this movie.The whole movie was really well made, this is great movie. 8 out of 10PS: The second movies series is not worth watching but 3rd movie in series is better then second,it not as great as this movie.",8,1,1,7 August 2011
Alien vs. Predator," Not great but decent movie
","I can't not believe this movie is already 10 Years old, The last night was the first I saw it in full. I did think, it took a while for the movie, to get going, I was bored with first half hour but I just could not care for those people.All I was waiting for was Alien VS Predator , I really enjoyed the fight scenes with these AliensI Thought it was decent battle. it was not to long and wasn't to short and over in seconds. Things about this VS movies, is that you always feel, that one monsters are better or feel less evil, then there pass movie.I don't like the Predator felt more of goody in this movie, even Alien saved her in early part of the movie.I thought Alien was great in this movie, I actually felt sorry for most of the Aliens, I did not find it as fun as Freddy VS Jason, which was lot more fun.I wasn't to keen on the back story of movie, those scene was way over the top and looked really bad and silly. thankfully those scenes more longer. I thought it was decent, it could have been so much better then it was.(You know who side I am on) Alien all the way! The acting was okay in this movie, from the cast, i found everyone to be little annoying, I wasn't big fan of final girl, I was hoping for someone to killer her.

Within 28 days the country is overwhelmed and a handful of survivors begin their attempts to salvage a future, little realising that the deadly virus is not the only thing that threatens themThis is amazing movie, I really enjoyed the whole movie. This movie had a nice balance of drama and horror, these scenes made us care for the characters. The way the infected people run really fast was bloody scary and this movie did not have that much gore however there are some really nasty scenes in this movie. This movie as some very scary scenes and some shocking scenes too, which is helped by the the great acting from the whole cast.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes," This was really well made, I loved it! (A MUST SEE!)
","I was thinking it will be a fun action pack movie from start to end. well i got that wrong. (But that not a bad think at all)I found this movie really depressing and emotional, I am not a shame to say I almost cried at some parts, my eyes were getting watery. (Number of girls left early as they crying a lot)I really like the whole slow build to the story was really good, I cared for these monkey/Apes ( these seem nicer then the looters we had in England that week)The Actions scene you seen in the trailer is mostly in the last half hour of movie. which was a lot fun to watch and I was cheering for the apes!I think the end fitted in really wellGreat movie 9 out of 10",9,2,5,17 November 2011

I really loved effect of the creatures in movie, Really well, some were funny look and some were scary. Love first part of the movie however I didn't like later part of movie, the whole bible turned people against each other.

Evil Dead," Average Horror movie!
","This remake or reboot what ever you what to call it, it not as bad as other Classic horror remakes like Friday, Elm street and The Omen however I don't think was good as some other remakes.I did expect a lot more from this movie after all the hype it got, I thought there would have more gory then it was. I thought there were some good decent gory scenes which Did like but nothing we not really see before and I didn't really find the demon creepy or scary at all.The rest of the movie, well it wasn't boring, it was fast paced Before I knew it was over .Again another trailer that shows the best parts of the movie that lead to the rest of movie not having many surprising moment which makes the rest of kind of predicable.The acting decent from most of the cast, I could not connect to them at all and effect was not bad but as fun as originalI give this movie 5 out of 10 Average horror movie",5,7,15,19 April 2013

Across the border in Mexico, the mysterious Carlos offers sanctuary to criminals on the lam, but first they must slip past the border patrol. Enter the Fuller family: Jacob, a minister who has lost his faith and his children, the vulnerable teenage Kate and her younger brother Scott, on a road trip in their new R.V. The Gecko Brothers kidnap the Fullers and high-tail it to freedom with the promise to let the family go once they hook up with their criminal connection in Mexico. The rendezvous point is the Titty Twister, the wildest bar this side of the Rio Grande. The night is full of seductive promise as the group settles back to wait for Carlos and his boys to arrive at sunrise. But unbeknown st to the brothers or their hostages, the management and staff of this particular establishment have a taste for blood--in the vampire sense.The opening of this movie is total different to the rest of the movie as starts of like something in gangster movie.I am NOT a huge fan of vampire movies,, i just can get into then,, the one I have seen are Samles lot and 30 Days of Night l like those movies , I have also tired to watch blade movies, i just can not get to that all and now back to this movie.This as great scary vampires in this movie, i really liked how they changed out the blue sometimes, which make the movie really scary and some of deaths scenes were really good.This movie as some great Amazing Special Effects which were really Gory and some of transformation are really great and the make up effects for the vampires were really good and made they look really scary.There do have a lot of blood and gore in this movie and a lot of nudity (but not overboard) and they add some nice humour into this movie too, there are some really funny scenes in this movie which will make you laugh.The acting in this movie is really good from the whole cast.

Paranormal Activity," I demanded it and I loved it!

Green Street Hooligans," Great movie (Best of the 3)
","I have seen this movie a few times, I really enjoyed each time I watch it, the fight scenes were really well done and very well shot. (This weekend, I saw all 3 Green Street movies back to back)I liked that the fight scenes were not for a few seconds or they don;t go on for too long,I liked the story of the plot, how some can be drawn into this worldA Long with that we. have father who wants revenge that goes to far also we have betrayal as well and some heartache added into the mix.It kind of a bit moving at times and little sad at the end of the movie, some may even say it be tearjerker ending .Great acting from the cast, some make up effect, which makes fight look real! 8 out of 10",8,0,0,25 March 2014

There were some great decent scenes in this movie, I wouldn't say there scary but there a lot fun to watch. Some parts of the movie were cheeses at times, I loved those scenes and there some really funny moment that made laugh. The graveyard scene went over the top with Rain, how much rain fell in 3 minutes, to fill that hole. Near the end the story got bit predictable and I knew were the story was going, it okay, some effect at end, did not look as good as early effects in the movie.7 out of 10",7,2,5,22 March 2014

Neither man knows why he has been abducted, but instructions left on a micro cassette order Dr. Gordon to kill Adam within eight hours. If he fails to do so, then both men will die. I can not say a lot, as there is a lot of twists and turns in this.This movie it not as gory as sequels but they do have a nasty scene.The acting was not great but it fitted I well with the rest of the movie.There was one scene I did find really a bit creepy.I did not see the twist coming at all, I was really shocked.This will always be the best Saw.I going to give this movie 9 out of 10",9,1,3,9 February 2010

","Know this was going to be PG 13 in US however in the UK Rated 15 I was afraid this would be this year The Women in Black PG 13 bore-fest, However this as put my faith back into PG 13 /15 Movies. As I found this more enjoyable then The Women in black and sinister put together and this movie but PA series to shame, I thought this had some really good Jumpy scare in this movie I did Jump really early in the movie, this dose have some really good intense though tout the movie. The movie flowed really well and it never once got boring at all and no scenes drag longer then should, This movie did have some flaws here and there but they don't to much impact on the movie, I also did like effect of the of MAMA as you get a little to often, she dose not seem as scary as the movie goes.I did find the MAMA bit more creepy in the short, she kinda of Ju-on-the Grudge Ghost and I wasn't really to keen on Soppy ending was not need at all, that part really left the movie down, While i felt really sad and I some people will find that very tearing. thought was really good AS i did not expect to Jump at all in this movie and seen plenty of horror movies, (If was higher rated, i would have gave it lower score) 7 out of 10 ___________",6,0,2,22 February 2013

Normal I don't silly stuff, this really annoyed me in some parts, Main lead hears a loud noise but no ones else seem to hear it, even the next night, when he falls, makes noise and starts screaming really loud, No one else seem to here or come by after he fall thought the floor! The other thing that really annoyed me was the really loud shouting scenes, it was over the top and was not needed at all, my head start hurt! This movie as Nothing we not really see before in pass horror movies, For me this me kinda drag on a little, when we finally know the story. Then they rush the the ending as it's gets way too predicable, there one scenes that really reminded me of Insidious as well. talking about Insidious, I was not big fan of it but I Would watch that over this any day. 5 out of 10",5,8,21,7 October 2012

Who can forget about that famous shower scene, which still kinda of work after all these years and I thought the whole movie was really great.The only bad thing that I can say about this movie is that one scene did look little out dated then the other parts of the movie , I am talking about the Stairs death dose look little silly today.Also The acting in this movie was great from the whole cast and Alfred Hitchcock did an outstanding job on this movie. 9 out of 10",9,0,0,20 January 2013

The Conjuring," Better then average horror movie
","I didn't let those rave reviews get to me and I didn't get my hope up like I did last year with Sinister , which I thought trailer was great but the movie was HUGE let down and found the movie very boring and dull and not creepy or at all scary, other part of the movie that really annoyed me and I fell sleep in some scenes So that is the reason I didn't get hope up to much for this year Horror movie THE CONJURING (2013) , First of all the trailer did make this look it was going to full of those scary jumps scene that don't last for then one two seconds and I do think they showed a little to much in the trailer. I clad I didn't get my hope up to high for this movie, it was really good horror movie, it dose not any new ground that not already seen. Saying that I did really enjoy the whole movie, I found that did prefer the first half of the movie, where the strange thing started to happen to each member of the family. There were some really good decent creepy scenes in the movie that lasted much longer then those 2 seconds jump scarce you normal see in horror movie these days. Other think I liked about this movie they didn't really try to make you jump at all they wanted to creepy you and keep you clued to the screen the on time. I wasn't to keen on last half hour of the movie, it cause it seen those scenes done many times in the recent years, it get a bit boring and very predicable however the scenes it was not boring which is a really good thing. I was hoping for more of aftermath of the thing that just happened but it ended a bit soon after the story came to a end. I didn't get what last scenes about could not make What I meant to be seeing! it was very good and very creepy horror! (Another really good horror movie from 2013) 7 out of 10",7,0,3,4 August 2013
Scream," The best slasher movie.
","This movie had great opening scenes, the scenes is so well made, Girl picks her phone up and then she joking with the person on the phone under ten seconds she is scared out her mind and then she is killed by the person in Ghostface mask and then her body has be hanged in front her house that is see by father and mother, the mother scream will send shiver down your back.This movie is great, it had a great plot and filled with great scary and some creepy moments and it also had a lot of humour in this movie (I am not saying it a horror/comedy).There are some really good shocking deaths this movie which make ghost face really scary and you can not wait to find out who the hell ghost face is.I was happy how the movie ended and acting from the whole fast was outstanding. Great slasher, funny, gory and scary, what more do need in a horror movie. I am going to give this movie 9 out 10",9,2,4,3 February 2010
Never Back Down," Really good movie
","I actually really enjoyed this movie, It's kind of had feel good movie vibe to it! I know that may sound little odd but I had fun watching this movie. I found the movie flowed really, I wasn't bored for one second, it's wasn't action packed.They had good mix of drama and action blended in really well. The action scenes or fight scenes, what ever you like call them, there were some really good fight scenes in this movie.I liked the fight scenes were not to quick and it's wasn't to long, so don't get bored with fight. I enjoyed the whole start to the end of the movie, the acting was great from the whole cast! (I had no idea there a sequel) 7 out of 10 Really good movie.",7,0,0,5 June 2014

Carrie," Outstanding
","I have the book but i have yet to read it, so i can't compare the movie to the book.I have seen both this and remake of Carrie that was made 2002, i did enjoy watching 2002 min-series but no were near as good this movie.Carrie is girl that seem get bully ed by others after losing a game in gym and they start bully her even more when she goes in to period in the shower but Carrie has no idea what happening to her.When Carrie get a bit angry she seem to move things with the her mind and seem to get stronger and more she get angry her powerful she can get.Sue was one of girl who teasing Carrie and she feel a bit guilty convinces Tommy will set to take Carrie to the prom.Later at the prom Chris and Billy make plan to get Tommey and Carrie and King of Queen, so they put their evil plan in action and see everyone start to laugh and the all hell break lose.This movie is fantastic, i don't know anyone who as not seen this movie, the acting in this movie outstanding from the whole cast.i going this movie 10 out 10",10,2,3,26 May 2010
1408," not scary or creepy but entertaining
","I have not seen this since, it first came out , I couldn't really Remember much from my first watch.So it been on my re watch list for some time, before breakfast I gave this movie watch (as it my day of today / we might be getting thunder showers latter , perfect setting to spend most of the day watching horror movies lol ) OK , now I am getting way off track, now back to the movie.I felt like the movie, took it's time to get going however I did enjoy, some of history of the victims.I would have liked here, why the ghosts are haunting that room in the first place.I didn't find the movie creepy, as there were no atmospheres but there some jump scene , which I did see coming, each time.Otherwise the movie was not boring at all, there was a lot of things happen in that small room.Some of the ghost effects, were a little too digital for me and not scary , that was one of the reason, why the jumps scence didn't work.I liked how the movie, kind of mess you around but clad how the story came to a end.The acting was great from, J C 6 out of 10",7,0,2,12 June 2015
The Woman in Black," Worth watching, The original is much better!
","It seem to be a lot more darker then old version. (Which i only saw two weeks (For the first time) before see this movie I loved it )But I can not say the same thing about this movie at all.Found this movie really dull most of the times, this movie had a even slower start then the original and did not find any of the scene scary at all or creepy.There was too many fake scares scenes in this movie, which got really boring quick and also made the scary scene feel really forced also it felt like the movie was missing half the story.Did not connect with Dan in this movie at all, most of time never say anything and never talks, What point of dog in this movie, in old version Guy and Dog connected but in this movie, it dose even seem say anything to dog and then dog goes missing, i dose even care.The ending just make the movie even worse, 4 out of 10The original (7/10) is far more superior then this remake, i felt connected with main guy in that movie and found it more intense and creepy.There was a lot more of a story in there as well The ending of that movie was chilling as hell and gave me the creeps for a few days Much better this silly ending they had in this remake!",4,1,2,29 March 2012
Bruce Almighty," Great fun for the whole family !
","Bruce is having a really bad day and knows that god his picking on him.The next day he gets a call from someone and he goes to a place and meets Morgan Freeman who plays god in this movie.Bruce then said he could do better job then God , so God then give him his powers.It't take a bit for him to get used to the powers as first, then he starts having a lot of fun with being God, like making his wife boobs bigger who played by Jennifer Aniston and give himself a great car, getting his Job back also getting jerk fired from his Job. ( who end up being in the sequel of this movie). for me that is one of the best scene of the movie, it was really funny.Then things start go wrong as Grace leaves him and there to many prays every second of the day.There were some really funny moment in this movie, I really enjoyed watching this movie.There were great acting from the whole cast was really good. I going give this movie 7 out of 10 I also liked the sequel to movie, it not as good as this movie, but still a fun watch.",7,1,1,30 December 2010
Casino Royale," Worth watching
","Casino royal I know the whole series had reboot but I thought the opening scene was OK! I did not mind the black and white scene but why did they mess around with James Bond theme , did not like that at allThis movie had some decent actions scenes , I did not really like how they portrayed James Bond in This movie.To me that felt more like a impostor taking over James role, I didn't really care for in any part of the movie, like the pass movies. The poker games that went on for tens years , those scenes were so dull , I never been so bored, which I thought went on for far to long. I did not like how story came to end at all but the last scene just felt forced to me 4/10",4,3,5,15 January 2015
Signs," This has to be one the scariest sci-fi movie ever made!
","I for one loved this movie.The story The Hess family lives on a farm Graham Hess is a priest whose wife, Colleen, died traffic accident caused by a veterinarian named Ray Reddy. He cares for his children Morgan, who has asthma, and Bo with the help of his younger brother Merrill. Then a mysterious crop circle appears in his cornfield. some townspeople think that it's a prank while a few others think that it may have been real.Then TV is on news reports of violent animal behaver has spread across town but no one is watching meanwhile out side the kids are playing turn nasty when Morgan has to kill one of his own dogs when it attacks his sister.Really like the movie it was really good, they did have some plot holes that didn't bother me at all.what I really liked was when we get to see the alien on news, that always sends shivers down my spine every time I watch it.I can't believe this was rated 12, it should have least been rated 15! Acting from everyone was great 9/10",9,2,8,8 August 2009

This movie start of with bang and it dose not let up, this is action packed from the start, there are a lots of twist and turns in this movie, ,With one huge shocking twist in this movie, Which I never saw coming at all, the twist worked really well with rest of the movie.This movie had a great cast, they were all outstanding in this movie.I would not say this movie is Scary or anything however it dose have one or good nasty so-what gory death scenes in this movie.Since I Saw this movie, I have recommended this movie to everyone I know.

The Birds," masterpieces there is no other word for it!
","The Birds is one of the greatest horror movies ever to be made, it's not just a great. it's a masterpieces. This movie has some of incredible scenes I have ever see in any horror movies! Outstanding performance from Mitch (Rob Taylor), Lydia Brenner (Jessica Tandy), Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette), Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) Cathy Brenner (Veronica Cartwright) and every one else involved! The Summary Beautiful young Melanie Daniels, a wealthy socialite whose father is the proprietor of a large newspaper, visits a San Francisco pet shop to pick up a myna bird she has ordered for her aunt. There, Melanie meets Mitch Brenner, a lawyer who is looking for a pair of lovebirds to give to his young sister.Intrigued by him, she buys the lovebirds and finds the address for Mitch's home in bodega bay a small coastal village up the Pacific coast. Melanie drives to Bodega Bay and delivers the birds by sneaking across the small harbour in a motor boat to the Brenner residence. Melanie walks right into the house and leaves the birds on a table with a note. As Melanie is headed back across the bay, Mitch circles around in his car to meet her. Just as she is about to pull up to the dock, a seagull swoops down and gashes her head.Over the next few days the avian attacks continue, as Melanie develops relationships with Mitch, his clingy mother, Lydia, his teenage sister, Cathy, and Cathy's teacher (and Mitch's former lover), Annie. One of my favourites scenes in any horror movies is when the Grows gather outside the school waiting to attack the kids when they come out! And When Grows attacks Kids so very well done, really scary at the same time and Suspense in that scenes was magnificent, This movie holds Suspense until the last second of the movie. Alfred Hitchcock did a superb job on directing and after 44 Years after movie first came out this is now a classic. I said it before and I say it again This movie is a masterpieces there is no other word for it!",10,5,10,14 January 2008
Evil Dead II," Funny and Scary
","This Evil dead 2 not as Dark The Evil dead and it more of comedy, which is not bad thing at all.The plot Sequel to The Evil Dead where Ash does not manage to escape the evil from the first movie. Retelling the story only leaves Ash and his girlfriend in the beginning for whatever reason. Ash must now survive another night in the cabin accompanied now by the Professor's daughter, a mechanic, an associate of the Professor, and the mechanic's girlfriend. But the thing in the darkness vows that they will be.This movie has some scary moments and the demons are still scary in this movie but the most is just playing hilarious! from stat to end, there still a lot gore in this movie, less then The Evil Dead.Not as awesome as The Evil dead but still fantastic sequel the acting from Ash was Outstanding.I am going to give this movie a 9/10",9,2,3,25 January 2010
