The Blair Witch Project," The Ultimate Suspense Thriller
","The Blair Witch Project is possibly the best horror movie in terms of suspense. It keeps your eyes glued to the screen as the suspense rarely lets up. It is truly a spectacular horror movie as it will definitely frighten you and at the same time keep you interested.The Blair Witch Project is about 3 teens who go off into the woods searching for a legendary creature called the Blair Witch which is supposed to haunt the nearby woods. The students never come back. However a year after their disappearance, their footage is found. The movie is the entire footage that the 3 students shot.There are many elements that make the film so great. The most obvious one is that the students become lost in the woods. Being lost in the woods is bad enough. But when you have unexplained elements plaguing you while you are lost that takes it to a whole new level.Another element that increases the fear is the many things we do not know. We all have a fear of the unknown and this movie plays into that strongly. So many eerie things happen to the students that they are unable to explain. The fact that we never see the antagonist or the witch adds to the creepy sensation and builds up the fear.The best element of the movie is the perspective the viewer sees it from. Since the entire movie is from the view of the camera the students carry, the viewer sees and experiences everything from the point of view of the characters. So in a sense we get to go through what the characters do.Overall the movie keeps up the suspense as viewers never know what to expect. By day we follow the teens as they walk through the woods in an attempt to find civilization. Along the way they find more supernatural elements that challenge their sanity. At night unearthly sounds are heard beyond the light of their campfire.The Blair Witch Project is not the typical horror movie in that it is all about suspense rather then being pursued by someone. There is no doubt someone or something is stalking the students. But unlike most horror movies this movie is more about agonizing suspense and the unexplained rather then stopping an antagonist or killer. It is that that makes it such a suspenseful and fantastic horror movie. The Blair Witch Project is one of the best horror movies and I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone regardless of whether you like horror movies or not. No matter your preference the movie will not disappoint you.",10,2,6,31 May 2009
Miracle," Mesmerizing Movie!
","Miracle is one of the better sports movies that I have seen. The movie portrays the United States team's unlikely Gold Medal victory at the 1980 Winter Olympics. It does one hell of a job at capturing one of the greatest moments in sports history.There are many elements that make the movie great. The actors really get into it and make you believe they are the players. Kurt Russell turns in an astounding performance as Team USA's coach Herb Brooks.The critical event in the movie however is the time period and events surrounding everything. The Miracle On Ice occurred during the Cold War and not long after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Morale was deteriorating at home and the country was in desperate need of a morale booster. That came in the form of a hockey game.The Soviet Union had been the dominant hockey power for years winning gold medals in 64, 68, 72, and 76. The US is a team made up of young college kids molded into an effective unit by coach Herb Brooks. The US would end up playing the Soviets as a huge underdog. It is a story of the little team that could versus the superpower. David versus Goliath basically. The events taking place made this more then a hockey game. This was a competition between 2 countries with heightened tensions. Even before the puck drops you can feel the intensity in the air.Overall you don't have to like hockey or know an ice skate from a roller skate to appreciate this movie. It is an unlikely underdog story surrounded by international turmoil. The movie is inspiring and the best fact is it really happened. Miracle is a must see.",10,5,6,7 May 2009
The Hangover," Exceeds Expectations!
","I have been waiting to see The Hangover ever since the first trailer came out. It looked a great comedy and I was looking forward to seeing it. Well I finally saw it last night, and I must say it was awesome. I expected it to be funny, but it exceeded even my expectations.The Hangover follows 4 friends celebrating their bachelor party in an outrageous fashion. They go to Las Vegas and are looking forward to having a good time. However when they wake up the next morning, things aren't right. One friend is missing, one has lost a tooth, they find a baby in their hotel room, and they can't remember a thing. With the wedding coming up in a few days the 3 of them must find their missing friend. They spend the movie doing that with hilarious events happening along the way.All of the actors deliver in the film. The supporting actors do a fantastic job and Mike Tyson delivers a great punchline (I'm not talking about a joke). As the days go by and the friends continue their search, crazy things happen to them, each worse then the last. With each passing scene the film gets funnier and funnier.The Hangover will make you laugh and it doesn't let up on the comedy. If you want to have a great laugh, this is the film to watch. It is easily the funniest film of the year.",10,4,10,20 June 2009

The Dark Knight," Movie Of The Year!
","The Dark Knight was the top film in 2008 hands down. No other movie came close to equaling the excellence this movie displays. There are many different elements making the movie fantastic.Acting: Every actor and actress brings their A game in this movie. Christian Bale reprises his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He strikes a perfect chord as the hero trying to walk the fine line between vigilante and full outlaw. However the real character that steals the show right from the beginning is the Joker. Heath Ledger played the role of a maniac with devil like cunning to perfection. Make no mistake, the Joker is easily the best character of the piece. The supporting cast is right up there as well. Aaron Eckhart plays the hero turned villain as Harvey Dent/Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the romantic interest of Bruce and Harvey and gets into her character like they all do. Michael Caine continues to act as the father figure to Bruce giving him advice and speaking his mind. This movie has acting at its best.Plot: If a movie has a poor plot, not even the best actors can save it. However the plot in this movie is spectacular. Batman, Jim Gordon, and new DA Harvey Dent team up and are effective in going after crime and the mob in the city. But in life there is always a balance. Enter the Joker who is out to counter Batman and his force for good. The Joker is as cunning as the devil and in a few short scenes tears down everything that Batman and the others have worked so hard for. The Joker is a villain Batman does not know how to handle. The back and forth match between the two makes for a great movie.Music: The score for The Dark Knight was done brilliantly by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard. The music helps capture the dark feel for the movie. It is done so well after you watch the movie, you may want to go out and buy the score. I think it is safe to say the music is one of the best movie soundtracks in quite some time.Overall there is not one bad element to this movie. It doesn't matter if you like or care for Batman or any comic movies for that matter. This movie will blow you away and you will want to watch it over and over again. The Dark Knight is a must see.",10,3,7,24 June 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," Phenomenal Movie!
","The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most touching and greatest movies I have ever seen. The movie is based on the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. Unlike most of his novels King didn't write a horror story but instead a inspiring tale of hope in unlikely places. Overseeing the transition from book to big screen is Frank Darabont who in his director debut scores a home run with this movie.Not only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a fantastic job as the 2 central characters and as friends. Bob Gunton is great in the part of the villain as the evil warden. The directing, cast, and plot all combine to make the movie awesome.The plot of the movie revolves around Andy Dufresne a man who is imprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit. Over time Andy becomes friends with Red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling in things into the prison. The story then follows the 2 and how they handle prison life.Years go by but Andy continues to speak of hope. Ultimately Andy will commit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly inspirational. The message the story delivers is to never give up hoping. The climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of the greatest in film history.Overall the Shawshank Redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time.",10,2,3,16 May 2009
