The Sound of Music," ::this is a piece of TIMELESS classic and a venerable musical::
","gosh~ i couldnt be happier to find that therez actually someone else (not one,but many!) out there who has the SAME opinion as i DO~ ~!!!! im fr m'sia and recently this movie has been broadcasted thru the Disney channel and albeit having to study day and nite for my upcoming A levels, i couldnt resist the temptation when the show is being aired.......OMG! not only the captain wuz mesmerizing ,but the whole PLOT, story line,and the characters, casts......all have undoubtably contributed greatly to the success of this timeless classic!!!! yeah,and i want to stress here that the captain IS so GOODLOOKING......and really really,captivates ppl's heart with the way he acted and portrayed the role of Captain Von Trapp.....tho having watched it for the umpteenth time in the past (since the tender age of nine),i did not really pay attention to the Captain that much as i was more interested in the singing and the children and the sweet maria played by julie andrews. dont get me wrong, she is stil as sweet and the movie is stil one of my favourites!!no, i should say that i love that movie and itz nevertheless the best movie that i've seen!! having established this, i could rightly claim the title of a hard core fan of The Sound of Music...... another element that has no doubt made the movie such a success was that the sceneries of the Austrian Alps and the green pastures and the enchanting picture and marvellous chereography of the movie.that had done a tremendous job !despite having to face my exams,i've watched the whole movie for 3 times in a matter of 3 weeks in spite of having watched it for like more than 20 times over the years..now im trying to find the DVD of it so i can crystalize this beautiful movie that has ever been maid in movie history.but one thing that i dont understand is that why has christopher plummer been so irreverent of that movie and have regarded it as the sound of mucus and rendered that itz not one of his favourite movies.",10,3,10,8 May 2004
