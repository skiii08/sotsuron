Ali," Could have been great
","The best thing about this movie is the actors. Wil Smith was a great Ali. As were the both unrecognizable Mario Van Peebles (Malcom X) and Jon Voight. And, Jamie Fox gave a memorable performance as Bundini. This movie had some really beautiful moments between characters, but all were under developed and in many cases they didn't bother identifying the characters (who was Paul Rodrigez supposed to be?) This film left me wondering what Muhammed Ali was really like. At times they seemed to forget to focus on Ali. Oh yeah, and someone should take out whoever's responsible for the shaky camera shots. It was worse than the Blair Witch Project.",4,0,0,3 January 2002
The 13th Warrior," see this movie again
","I saw this in the movie theater when it first came out and I grudgingly liked it (because of Antonio). Lately, its been showing a lot on the movie channels and the more I see it, the more I appreciate what they've done in this movie. Rarely a movie gets better with multiple viewings, but this one does. The cinematography is great in capturing the beauty of the virgin forests and the claustrophobic darkness of having to live by firelight. They really give you a sense of what life must have been like at that time. Storywise, I love how none of the warriors are spared. Which when you think about it, makes perfect sense. Antonio is wonderful bringing a lot of comic relief to the movie. For a leading man, he thankfully doesn't hog the spotlight. And the bad guys remain superhuman and creepy. So to anyone who didn't like it the first time, I recommend seeing this movie again. It's on enough and even with fifty million channels, sometimes it's the best thing on tv.",10,0,0,19 August 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Believe the hype
","I was concerned after reading all the positive reviews that this movie wouldn't live up to my growing expectations. But it did. LotR is a wonderful movie and its so good I'll probably go back a few times to see it again. The three hours flew by and I am so ready for the Two Towers. Sure, Jackson couldn't put everything from the book in the movie, but trust me, by the end you really don't mind. In fact you'll just want to thank everyone who made this movie for staying true to the book and one-upping it. What you get in Jackson's LotR is a satisfying, visionary adaptation. And, if that doesn't make you want to see it, go for Orlando Bloom's Legolas, he is such a cutie.",10,0,0,20 December 2001
