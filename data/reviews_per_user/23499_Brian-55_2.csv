Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Honestly better the second time around
","This movie is a classic example of how we can allow the media to persuade our way of thinking. I liked this movie a lot when I saw it in the theaters, but after review after review panning it, my memory become colored by them.I just recently got the special edition on VHS (widescreen is really the only way to experience these movies) and watched it twice. I loved it even more! One of the best parts is now I can actually understand Jar Jar Binks and Trade Federation characters. Originally their accents were just too thick to be comprehensible.I'm sure there are others that feel as I do, so go ahead, watch it again and see if you can find more to the movie this time around, I know I did.",9,11,15,10 April 2000
Final Destination," Truly Scary
","This really was a frightening movie with a clever premise. Some very solid acting from a set of teen actors, but the overall thrill is in figuring out death's little game.Highly recommended for fans of 'Scream' and the like. Not recommended for those afraid of flying!",8,0,2,11 January 2001
