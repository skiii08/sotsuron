Hereditary," Best horror film of 2010s.
","Look here, I love me some horror. For years we got WarnerBros giving us the idiotic clown, Universal's Purge and Finally, arguably the best company made this gem. This movie had my mouth up all the time. The film is so magnificent with cinematography and soundtrack. Let's not forget the acting. Oscar worthy performances. Scary scenes. Must- Watch this maximum twice so you fully understand the movie.",10,0,2,4 November 2019
Coco," I Don't Know!
","Look, the concept is cool and animation is gorgeous but the vibe this movie gives is bland, dull, and weird. I cant explain it. It's so melo-dramatic and lifeless, I cant find myself looking at this again. Overrated and the worst thing Pixar gave out to us.",4,0,2,22 March 2020
