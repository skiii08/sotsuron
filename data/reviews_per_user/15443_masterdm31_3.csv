The Incredible Hulk," Only Enjoyable for Comic Lovers
","The Incredible Hulk (2008) stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, who isn't the greatest Hulk by any means. The backstory of Banner was good and interesting, different from any of the other Marvel characters, but the movie drags out so long. The Hulk is really only on-screen for a combined 15 minutes, including the last fight seen with Abomination. The villain in this movie is confusing to detect as well. Movie is just boring and drawn out, only enjoyable for die hard Hulk fans, but if you miss it, there is no problem.",6,0,0,17 February 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," Good War Movie, Fun Captain America Story
","Captain America (2011), stars Chris Evans, who is the only man (in my opinion) who can play Steve Rodgers excellent. Although this movie is fun and the story taking place in the 1940s, it drags on. There were multiple times I was bored and zoned out. Other than that, good execution with the film.",6,0,0,19 February 2018
Black Panther," Great Marvel Superhero FIlm
","Black Panther is such a fun time for Marvel fans. Even for fans who don't watch Marvel's movies consistently, this movie delivers. There are some events that conclude in this movie that took place in Captain America: Civil War (2016), but the film summarizes everything so no audience member is confused. Michael B Jordan is phenomenal as Erik Kilmonger, he is (in my opinion), one of the best Marvel villains in a while. The girls around him (Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and Letitia Wright), all do an amazing job not only to elevate T'Challa, but themselves as well. The movie just delivers in all cylinders, great film.",9,4,17,19 February 2018
