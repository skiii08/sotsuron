The Expendables 2," Very Sad
","I am VERY CONFUSED on these ratings, 7.7? Fun and Action-Pack? Seriously? This is a joke, this movie is horrible one of the worst movie I seen all year. good thing I didn't pay to see it.It has no plot or story, don't you guys get tired of explosions and guns blasting? This movie features 3 of the top martial artists, Van Damme, Li, and Adkins but their fight scenes were extremely weak and lousy. What a waste of talent especially with the addition of Scott Adkins, he should have been in a fight scene with jet Li not Statham, Statham didn't know what the hell to do while Adkins was throwing them kicks. Just like Stallone and Van Damme's fight, 2 spinning back kicks and then gets beat up. What a joke, might as well just shoot him.For those of you who did not see it, don't bother. Save yourself 2 hours, buy a six pack and drink instead.",1,15,28,25 August 2012
