Blade Runner 2049," Boring
",It could not keep my interest in 30 minutes. Horribly boring. I turned it off. The studio's are now making 3 hour movies. I have a hard time committing 3 hours to a movie. It needs to grab my interest quickly and give me some Idea of the plot. In 30 minutes this did none of that. I got more information from the tiny intro text than the movie.,1,5,9,2 June 2018
