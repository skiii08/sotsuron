Casablanca," Well Made
","Casablanca is one of those classics were you don't have to say to much to convince someone that it is an amazing movie. This film is incredibly well made when it comes to its cinematography, set design, acting, direction and so much more. Now with all of this said you might be wondering why I gave it a 7 and the reason for this rating is its watchability and over all excitement for me. The movie is exciting and all but nothing that I would want to watch more then a few time a year and its just not something that I would recommend someone for an exciting weekend movie. This is a movie Id recommend watching at least once if you've never seen it before.",7,0,3,12 May 2016
The Graduate," Love this movie
","This is by far one of my favorite movies that I've ever seen. I've seen this movie multiple times and honestly I have not been disappointed once. This movie is full of amazing shots, music, acting and more. Dustin Hoffmen has to be my favorite actor in the whole movie. He is excellent at selling his role as ben and really brings the character to life. This movie is full of comedy that still keeps me laughing even though I've seen it before. Hoffmen is not the only good actor in this movie. Almost everyone else in the movie is amazing as well really making there characters believe-able. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone and if you haven't seen it you need to.",10,3,4,13 May 2016
Singin' in the Rain," surprisingly good
",Now I am not really the biggest fan of musicals out there. In fact I usually hate them and cant stand watching them. This was a surprisingly good film that doesn't have to much to not like in it. From the beginning this movie is very funny and energetic. Cosmo was by far my favorite character in the movie because he is always funny and full of life. His song half way through the movie has to be my favorite song and favorite part of the movie. Now with all of this good it doesn't mean this movie is perfect. there is one scene in particular that I hate and that is the final sing and dance number. This song starts off good like the last but ends up dragging on to the point where I almost just wanted to turn the movie off and call it a quite's. Not only was it dragging on but the quality of that song was going down in my opinion as the song keeps going. But all and all I would probably recommend this movie to anyone.,7,0,1,13 May 2016
