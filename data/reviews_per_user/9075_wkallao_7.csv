The Avengers," A Waste of Time
","This movie is just another one of Marvel's ploys to get money. After pushing out a mess of films forced to tie in with this once, you get a 2 hour, generic plot with characters who have generic back stories and abilities and are forced to work together and undoubtedly come together as one. It is NOT an original plot or even creative. I fail to see how long scenes of fighting, with the camera cutting back and forth is entertaining. If you actually truly LIKE this movie, please go see a doctor.I can't wait to see how the second film turns out. Marvel makes money purely being MARVEL, not because their films are outstanding and groundbreaking. They all have a generic plot and generic heroes. We need God to save us",1,6,13,28 March 2015
Hereditary," Well Made, Well Done - Not Scary
","If you're going into this movie expecting a horror film, you'll be sadly mistaken. This film has moments that unnerve you, shock you and may even disturb you. These unsettling moments contribute to the uneasy atmosphere present throughout the film, but it is not a horror film. The 'scares' are fare and few between and is spread so thin, you forget this is even supposed to be a scary movie.Many times I found myself bored and questioning why anything is even happening in this film. It's a plot that reveals itself at the end and you have to wonder - why? What is the purpose of anything happening? You won't find that answer.However, the film has incredible acting, amazing cinematography and well crafted score and screenplay. This film falls short on it's ridiculously laughable story and lack of actually being scary. You may jump here and there, but the scares are over in a snap and rarely carry over for you to actually be scared for more than a minute.",5,3,6,11 June 2018
Suicide Squad," A Turn Around For The DCEU
","I was pretty anxious about this film at first. Man of Steel and Batman V Superman weren't all that greatly received, and weren't that good in my personal opinion. I was worried for the future of the DC Extended Universe. I thought it could only get worse or stay the same, but I was wrong!DC has extremely strong villains, that's why this was the perfect story to show and tell. The premise is something innovative and new, not been done before in a theatrical release. Harley Quinn was incredible, and a highlight of this movie. Margot Robbie portrayed her so well, and couldn't have done better, aside from the costume. A solo movie will be amazing! Her relationship with the Joker was perfect.Deadshot was great as well, giving him motivation to care for his daughter, and just wanting what's best for her. Similarly with El Diablo and his deceased family. Many of the villains were shown in a lighter side, and gave them humanity instead of being seen as cold blooded monsters.The story was executed so well and so close to the original material. This is such a high note for the DCEU, despite what critics say. This is a turn around, and with Wonder Woman coming up next, this film series is headed straight for the gold.",10,12,26,7 August 2016
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," Relevant, Beautiful and Legendary
","This is a film that has stood the test of time. It is nearly perfect. The story is one that is truly relevant, detailing the fight man faces against mother nature, and the drawbacks of the longevity of the fighting. The story is one we can all learn from, and is truly thought provoking. The score is incredible, truly fits the film and is such a pleasure to listen to. It is a beautiful film to look at and it's hard to believe that it was made in '84. This is another one in the basket for Ghibli. Truly remarkable.",10,1,1,27 September 2017
It Chapter Two," A Disappointing, Boring, Uninspired Sequel
","Where do I even begin? This movie is literally terrible. I kid you not.First off, the storyline structure is so messed up. The film is riddled with flashbacks of you Losers from the first film. The issue with that, is because those events took place in the first film, yet we never saw them - we don't care about those flashbacks! You cannot introduce something NEW in this film that supposedly already happened and expect us to care. A huge issue with these flashbacks is that it becomes formulaic. We get a flashback of one of the Losers, then we jump back to present day where they are in that location of the flashback. It's so boring and predictable to watch.Because of this, Pennywiise becomes so overexposed. He is not scary. We see him so much in this film, we are comfortable with him, thus he has no threat anymore. Because a bulk of this film is flashbacks, the main story is incredibly short. Because of the flashbacks and emphasis on that, the Losers don't feel united until the end of the film. We follow them individually, and it isn't interesting.Another issue for this 'horror' film, is that is isn't scary. It's filled with cheap jumpscares and loud music. That isn't scary! There is creepy imagery, but that is entirely different from being scary.There's so much ill placed comedy, that makes this film appear as if it was meant to be a comedy. It's...embarrassing. This film is tonally EVERYWHERE, and there are really weird, and disorienting editing choices as well.I will praise that this film is beautifully shot, and Jessica Chastain literally carries this film. The ending following the climax is also very sweet.Over all, this is a muddled and disappointing follow up. I don't recommend.",4,0,0,25 September 2019
Mother!," A True Work Of Art
","Mother! is a film that has been subject to a lot of criticism. Films that are a big metaphor or carry over an allegory are always subject to polarizing reviews. I believe this to be in part by many lazy people passing off half witted ideas as 'art', which in turn leads to true art being dumped on. Mother! is not a film for everyone, it really isn't. You will either love the film, or leave confused and resentful towards it. This film is a metaphor for the bible, and the destruction of Mother Earth. Jennifer Lawrence is Mother Earth, her husband is God, Harris is Adam and Pfeiffer is Eve, while their children are Cain and Abel. The glass piece Bardem holds in his office is symbolic of the 'forbidden fruit', which 'Eve' ultimately is tempted by. More people flock at the home until a party goer destroys a sink causing a leakage, indicated the flood that wiped out civilization. But after 'God' writes his new work, symbolic of the New Testament, more people retreat to the home. After a very disturbing and gruesome ending, the home is destroyed, just to be rebuilt again, showing the never ending cycle of the destruction of Earth. The ending is a doozy and as someone who enjoys horror, blood and guts - this will leave you emotionally shaken. I was borderline in tears by how utterly shocking it is. This is mainly a story about how we take and take from Earth, using up all its resources and hardly, or in some cases never, giving back to it. This film does a spectacular job of displaying not only the story of the Bible, but how we as a society are selfish, destructive and sometimes undeserving. This is without a doubt a masterpiece.",10,6,17,20 September 2017
The Breakfast Club," Nothing Will Ever Be This Good
","This film is truly one of kind. There is nothing else out there like it, and nothing will ever be like this film. It is a movie that encapsulates being a teenager so perfectly, and truly pulls back the facade of teenage cynicism to reveal real people going through real problems.Throughout the film, we follow five teens who are in Saturday detention. Why it may sound like the most mundane concept ever, it is one that ending becoming the most famous high school film of all time.Each character is so diverse in their own way. We can connect with them and how they feel about other characters, and even themselves. This is a film that is primarily driven by dialogue in its single setting location, and none of it comes off cheesy, fake or scripted. Everything seems to genuine and authentic.The only issue with this film is the ending. While a climax of a film doesn't require explosions or car chases, it needs to have some sort of closure. This film has a perfect closing narration done by one of the lead characters, but it just ends. There is no real resolution, and part of that might have to be due to the fact there is no overarching plot that is in most movies. The ending may be a bit dull and make you scratch your head, but for this type of film, it works perfectly.This is THE high school movie you need to see. It will change your life. And Judd Nelson, is quite the stud.",10,0,0,3 March 2018
