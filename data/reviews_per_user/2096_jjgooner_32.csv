Despicable Me 2," Entertaining but ultimately unsatisfying
","Despicable Me 2**1/2 (out of 4)98 mins / UCast: (voices) Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Benjamin Bratt, Miranda Cosgrove, Russell Brand, Ken Jeong, Steve Coogan, Elsie Kate Fisher, Pierre Coffin, Chris Renaud, Moises AriasDirectors: Pierre Coffin, Chris RenaudPlot: Gru is recruited by the Anti-Villain League to stop a new evil super-villain from taking over the world.JJ's Verdict: Although it is definitely flawed throughout, Despicable Me 2 gives audiences exactly what they wanted; more minions.The film no longer shows us the original Gru: an evil villainous criminal trying to steal famous objects, but a somewhat dull and loving father trying to please his three children. Both versions of Gru want you to empathise with him but only the original makes you care about him due to his total vulnerability. In Despicable Me 2, he seems almost faultless (apart from when it comes to women) which is something I dislike about this one in comparison to the original 2010 film. Gru is recruited by an irritating Agent from the Anti-Villain League who gets him to search a local Shopping Mall for a new super-villain who has developed a potion which, when entered into a living species, turns them into purple killing machines. From here Agent Wild and he try to discover who the baddie is. The most annoying thing about this film is that the moment you see the villain, you know it is him, and although the entire film keeps telling you it isn't him, it is so obvious it is. Every character seems to be completely stupid and without any logic at all. Gru is supposed to monitor the mall from a cupcake shop but there are no scenes expanding on the shop and it seems a waste to include what could be a great place for the minions to create mayhem. In the mall, there are forgettable supporting characters who aren't expanded on at all. I know it is a children's film but, considering its length, they really could have done something with all the under-developed characters the film leaves you with. The saviours in the film actually are the characters that are expanded on. Benjamin Bratt voices a fun villain whom I will leave unnamed and Kristen Wiig's Agent Wild, although starts off annoying, grows on you as the film passes and develops a cute relationship with Gru. The minions are back and better than ever with jelly growing and hilarious dream sequences. The little noises they make fail to grow old and keep you entertained throughout. Adults will feel unsatisfied with all the potential but the kids will love it. Stay tuned for a wonderful 3-D set of post-credit mayhem which gives us a nice hint to a Minions movie in 2014, which follows Kevin the Minion before he meets Gru.",6,7,13,6 July 2013
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Downey Jr. Runs Riot
","Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows***1/2 (out of 4)123 mins/ 12Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, Jared Harris, Noomi Rapace, Rachel McAdams, Kelly Reilly, Stephen Fry, Eddie MarsanDirector: Guy RitchiePlot: Sherlock Holmes enters a game of shadows with Professor John Moriarty, who is trying to start war between France and Germany, while profiting in the process. JJ's Verdict: What I love about this sequel to the hit film, 'Sherlock Holmes', is that it has the perfect balance between action, comedy and drama. The action is quick, no-nonsense and takes your breath away while also being fun and exciting. The film's bullet effects are breathtaking and not too dissimilar to the ones used in 'The Matrix.' The entire film is full of clever sound mixing and editing. The score used throughout the film is very playful and catchy which adds to the 'not taking it too seriously effect.' The whole film's Victorian set-up is once again spot on for a certain detective to mess around in. That is Downey Jr. 's Sherlock Holmes. RDJ is absolutely brilliant and the little situations his character gets into are absolutely laugh-out-loud. The whole film was written just to let him run riot with his incredible style of comedy acting. He also shows Holmes' more serious side as we see that even the most perfect men can get things wrong, after he witnesses a bomb attack he could have stopped.Jared Harris is chilling as Moriarty, while Noomi Rapace is good but her character has little effect on you, as a viewer. Jude Law provides the serious delivery of lines but is certainly likable as ever. New to most Americans, is Stephen Fry who plays Holmes' brother, Mycroft. The timing of his lines are perfect as ever with his irresistible dry wit. The fact that he calls his brother 'Shirley' and is physically superior to him, only causes for more enjoyment. The plot (as described above) is surprisingly a little thin, you only realise what is really happening until the second half of the film and it gets a little too politely global for Sherlock Holmes. However, these faults are second to the brilliant enjoyment of a film that finishes as it starts; intense, suspenseful and hilarious.",8,0,1,1 July 2013
Source Code," The Most Original Thriller In Years
","Source Code***1/2 (out of 4)93 mins/12Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, Jeffrey Wright, Michael ArdenDirector: Duncan JonesPlot: Soldier, Colter Stevens, is on an assignment to find out who placed a bomb on a train in Chicago. He is forced to keep reliving the moment until he finds the bomber.JJ's Verdict: Source Code opens with some overhead shots of the city of Chicago. These shots are beautiful and although seen many times before, feel completely original. This is down to constant uses of many shades of blue that stand out in the city. There are no feminine colours; just masculine. These describe the film perfectly. Source Code is a man's dream thriller showing a true, down to earth character making realistic decisions. When other films would just give the guy a gun, Source Code gives the guy a brain and a good deal of common sense. Another point is that (like the opening shots in the city) although we have seen similar plot elements in films like Groundhog Day, Inception and Robocop, Source Code feels so original.The film centres on Colter Stevens, a soldier who keeps returning to the same eight minutes in time to find out who is planting bombs on trains all around Chicago. These scenes are very intense and suspenseful and the film uses that clever trick to keep the audience interested; don't overload the film with detail, just reveal each little bit every few scenes or so. Of course, in a movie cliché, Colter gets easily distracted and falls semi-in-love with Michelle Monaghan. Although this may frustrate the viewer as they wish to see the film move on, it is pretty realistic. Jake Gyllenhaal brings an honest feel to his hero role and, like I already mentioned, acts like a normal person would. He really brings the character's despair and frustration of having to see the same people die over and over again. The rest of the cast performs well, with Jeffrey Wright making a great transformation into the serious header of the operation. Vera Famiga and Michelle Monaghan also put in solid performances, Famiga as the only person Colter can communicate with in-between his mission.Source Code, despite probably defying many laws of quantum physics, is entertaining, pretty original and extremely well-paced.",8,1,3,1 July 2013
Skyfall," Totally Unmissable
","Skyfall***1/2 (out of 4)143 mins/ 12Cast: Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes, Judi Dench, Naomie Harris, Berenice Marlohe, Albert Finney, Ben Whishaw, Rory Kinnear, Ola RapaceDirector: Sam MendesPlot: After MI6 is attacked, James Bond is sent to track and find the threat. However, what he finds tests his loyalty to M as her past comes back to haunt her.JJ's Verdict: After all the hype, 'Skyfall 'certainly lives up to expectations. Starting off with a brilliant pre-credits chase on the top of a train you get the sense this this is going to be a hell of a Bond film. With Bond presumed dead, M's job is under threat and to make matters worse, M16 has just been blown up. But when James turns up again he is almost instantly sent away to find out who did it. What he finds, though is Javier Bardem's Silva, a former agent of M16, who was left to die. From here we have some more great action sequences, London Underground chases and a thrilling finale in Scotland. Throughout the film, the script is full of witty one-liners and a few hilarious jokes. The acting is also the best out of any previous franchise entry. Daniel Craig is cool and suave, Javier Bardem is menacing but at the same time has an irresistible charm and Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as ever. Ben Whishaw and Naomie Harris slip into their roles nicely and Berenice Marlohe is very Bond-girly is the few scenes she has. Special mention also goes to Albert Finney for a brilliant turn as Kincade, Bond's old groundsman, and Rory Kinear, whose character, Tanner, has a much bigger role than in his previous films. However, the real star of the film is Judi Dench. The emotion she shows in her scenes is one of just an old and confused lady, struggling in this modern world, someone who just can't get a grip on life, no matter how hard she tries. Sam Mendes, who is more used to directing dramas, takes the action into his stride, making the most thrilling film this year!",9,2,10,1 July 2013
Iron Man 3," Exciting And Action-Packed
","Iron Man 3*** (out of 4)130 mins/ 12Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley, Rebecca Hall, William SadlerDirector: Shane BlackPlot: Following on from the events depicted in 'Avengers Assemble', Tony Stark has to maintain his relationship with Pepper Potts while fighting a new terrorist called the Mandarin.JJ's Verdict: What I like about 'Iron Man 3'is that it doesn't try to be bigger than 'The Avengers'. This film is more a character study of Tony Stark trying to cope in a changed world and of course Downey Jr. completely excels in this role. Stark has to cope with keeping his wife happy while also investigating some terrorist attacks, which obviously don't go together. And after he tells the whole world his home address it isn't long before he's left on his own trying to save the world with few resources. Through this we get to see more of the man behind the suit and of course he is carrying huge emotional baggage. His opposite number, the Mandarin (played superbly by Sir Ben Kingsley), isn't actually just after Stark but the whole world, which gives the film a more epic sense about it. The rest of the cast therefore, has slightly limited screen time and Don Cheadle's War Machine sadly, has almost no effect on the film whatsoever. Although he gets some plot choices wrong towards the end and will certainly annoy avid readers of the Iron man comics, special mention must go to Shane Black who hasn't made a film in eight years. He excels in directing the dialogue scenes and the visually brilliant and entertaining action sequences are really something to marvel at. Super stuff!",8,2,4,1 July 2013
Star Trek," How Star Trek Was Meant To Be
","Star Trek**** (out of 4)122 mins/ 12Cast: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Leonard Nimoy, Eric Bana, Bruce Greenwood, Karl Urban, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Anton Yelchin, Ben Cross, Winona Ryder, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer MorrisonDirector: J.J AbramsPlot: Nero, a Romulan madman, creates an alternate universe in which Kirk has no father as he is growing up, despises Spock, and is not the U.S.S Enterprise's captain. JJ's Verdict: When I originally heard that they were rebooting the Star Trek series, I was ultimately disappointed. Although Nemesis hadn't provided a terrific film, there was still potential in both the characters and the universe. I must confess, however, that J.J Abrams' Star Trek completely blew me away in its quick pacing, blazing action and effects and a incredibly good take on a series most had though dead. Acting as a prequel/alternate universe to the original television series, Star Trek introduces us to Kirk's father, George, who is forced to sacrifice himself and the U.S.S Kelvin to time-travelling Romulan, Nero, so that he can save the rest of his crew's life. This is the turning point in the story, meaning every single action done is part of an alternate universe. Being a reboot, this is a very clever way for director J.J Abrams, to separate his film from all previous Trek entries. The film then follows Kirk as he joins Starfleet at a young age and Spock as he leaves Vulcan to continue his emotional development at Starfleet. After a few amusing incidences, cheating and manipulating, they find themselves together on the Enterprise as they try to defeat and stop Nero from creating black holes that could destroy the federation's planets. Chris Pine stars as the young arrogant, overconfident womaniser that is Officer Kirk. He puts in a very funny and charismatic performance and if we had seen William Shatner's Kirk at that age, he probably would've been like that. The same can be said for all the actors portraying young versions of old characters. Zachary Quinto's Spock is obsessed and completely engrossed in logic and scenes where he and Kirk try to outdo each other leaves you stunned at their sheer hate and annoyance towards one and other.Some may be disappointed that Karl Urban's Bones McCoy is just an impression of DeForest Kelley's one, but he does, actually do the finest impression I've ever seen. John Cho and Anton Yelchin give strong performances as Sulu and Chekov (who keeps the V, W swap) and Simon Pegg's incarnation of Scotty is far funnier than James Doohan managed. In previous instalments, Uhara, although elegant, was never considered sexy. But here, Zoe Saldana transforms the character into a complete beauty whom both Kirk and Spock fight for. Also in the cast is future Avenger, Chris Hemsworth who, although on-screen for a matter of minutes, creates emotional impact as George Kirk, and Bruce Greenwood, who plays Enterprise Captain Christopher Pike strong and boldly, and also acts as Kirk's mentor.A nice little surprise for fans is the inclusion of the old universe's Spock, of course portrayed by living legend, Leonard Nimoy. It was an absolute joy to see him on screen and he provides knowledge to the younger characters since he was also drawn into the black hole. His storytelling skills are superb and you feel such despair for him as he describes losing his own universe forever. Eric Bana, who plays Nero, is however, the film's only casting stumble. His acting isn't bad, but he makes little effect on the viewer, for good or for worse. This could be because he is unrecognisable as a tattooed, bald Romulan, or maybe he just isn't suited to playing the bad guy. The film itself is well paced throughout and full of dazzling action sequences along with top of the market special effects. The modern re-design of the Enterprise's interior is ingenious and the film makes constant references to the original series, which is sure to please all die-hard Trekkies. This film is so entertaining and does what no one has done before. It makes Star Trek cool. This adaption is an amazing re-imagination of the Star Trek universe, which captures the human and philosophical elements of the old while giving it a fresh and modern update. The finale is absolutely thrilling and a final voice-over from Leonard Nimoy that calls space the final frontier and tells us to boldly go where no man has gone before, made me in complete awe of this film even more. The ultimate Star Trek and one of the (if not THE) finest and most accomplished films of the 21st century. A total joy which left me grinning from Vulcan ear to ear.",10,3,4,1 July 2013
World War Z," Scary and Thrilling
","World War Z*** (out of 4)116 mins/ 15Cast: Brad Pitt, Mireille Enos, Daniella Kertesz, James Badge Dale, Matthew Fox, Fana Mokoena, David Morse, Ludi Boeken, Elyes Gabel, Peter Capaldi, Ruth Negga, Pierfrancesco Favino, Director: Marc ForsterPlot: An outbreak of an unknown virus causes the world to fall into a zombie apocalypse JJ's Verdict: After all the budget problems, rewrites and re-shoots of the last act, you would think World War Z would be a major flop, both critically and commercially. However, Marc Forster has created a scary edge-of-your-seat thriller, which, of all the entries in Hollywood's new craze, gives us a surprisingly realistic depiction of how the world probably would cope in a zombie apocalypse. The film centres on Brad Pitt's character, a former United Nations employee Gerry Lane, who, after escaping to a government base from an outbreak of an unknown zombie virus, is forced to travel the world to find the source of the outbreak and eventually find out how to prevent it. Lane first travels to Korea where the Zombie pandemic was thought to have first broken out and is caught up in a they can see you but you can't see them type scenario. From here he moves to Jerusalem, the only city to have created a defence against the zombies, where he observes the city's giant wall blocking the zombies, only for the zombies to get over the wall and destroy the city. After a massive sequence on a zombie- infested aeroplane, Gerry lands in Cardiff where he faces off a group of zombies almost single- handedly, to reach the vaccination that will make people invisible to zombies. However ridiculous the idea of zombies taking over the world may seem, the film presents the story in a somewhat realistic way. In George Romero's zombie flicks of the 70's, the undead were slow and hard to take seriously as threats to people. In World War Z, the zombies can run, jump and attack like swarms of bees – a real and genuine threat to the human race. The zombie effects and creation are very good, and considering around 6 billion people become infected each zombie is given a completely new look that helps for the realism feel. The zombies themselves are incredibly freaky and genuinely scary for a PG-13 film in America (however in Britain it is a 15.)The epic destruction of the cities, although they have a 2012 feel to them, don't look too CGI and focus more on the emotional distress of people and their livelihood than 2012's special effects.Due to there being just one big-name star in this film, Brad Pitt has to hold up this film on his own. Do not fear however, as the Mr and Mrs Smith star excels in his biggest film yet (not best, but biggest box-office wise.) His presence on screen is both commanding and calming – even when in the middle of a zombie attack! There are bit parts for well-known actors David Morse and Peter Capaldi and a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo from Lost's Matthew Fox but the real star of the show is Daniella Kertesz who plays an Israeli soldier who escapes from Jerusalem with Lane and goes on to help him in Cardiff. She manages to look beautiful despite having most of her hair shaved off for the film, and gives fine support to Brad Pitt. A star of the future perhaps! The only real moan I have with this film is that it is terribly slow when not involving zombies and is full of your everyday Hollywood clichés like how one man discovers how to stop the zombies despite none of the world governments having a clue. The film was originally meant to end with a massive battle in Moscow but by the sounds of it, it would have made Pitt's character almost Superhuman and would have been out of tone with the rest of the film. So I am pleased that they went for a smaller-scaled Dawn of the Dead like chase in a Cardiff laboratory. World War Z is a refreshing entry in the zombie-filled world of pop culture and is well worth watching in 3-D for the zombie running effects.",8,3,6,6 July 2013
Argo," Average Thriller
","Argo**1/2 (out of 4)120 mins/ 15Cast: Ben Affleck, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Victor Garber, Tate DonavonDirector: Ben AffleckPlot: CIA agent, Tony Mendez, begins production on a fake movie, so that he can enter Iran and rescue six American fugitives who are wanted by Iranian terrorists.JJ's Verdict: For some reason, I was expecting Argo to be incredible and one of the best films I've ever seen. It is a good thriller but I was disappointed, considering the Oscar win and hugely positive reception surrounding it. If it were my choice, I probably wouldn't have even nominated Argo. Argo starts off well with a prologue into Iran's history and then depiction of the attacks on the U.S Embassy. These opening scenes are very intense and gritty, and this tone continues throughout. The film's design is also very good and definitely knows it is in the 80's with slick suits and cool moustaches. The script is also witty and full of some great industry in-jokes and a very funny cameo from Jack Nicholson. However, my real disappointment with Argo is the characters. There are far too many characters in the film, played by not very well-known actors so become hard to follow throughout. Another stumbling block is that many of these characters look too similar to each other, which makes them even harder to follow. This isn't so say the acting is bad, just decent. Ben Affleck, who I usually like in films, is incredibly one-dimensional in this film and the only time he ever steps out of this, is when the script forces him to, not by his own accord. His character, Tony Mendez, is so dull and throughout the film, Affleck puts on this highly unlikeable miserable stare for no apparent reason. The only bright sparks in Argo's acting, are John Goodman and Alan Arkin who play members of the film industry. They definitely have some of the films funnier lines but you can't really eel they are putting much effort in as all they are doing is playing themselves with little emotion. And once Mendez departs for Iran, you don't even see their characters until the final few minutes. Although his acting isn't up to scratch, Affleck directs this one really well. Maybe he was just too busy worrying about the film to notice his wooden acting. Affleck keeps the tension going extremely high and rarely lets the film stop for a breath. I does come in for a great Americana triumphant finish but you can't help thinking; because the writer mixed fact with fiction, was there any way they weren't going to escape from Iran?",6,1,2,1 July 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Just Another Predictable Action Film
","Star Trek Into Darkness** (out of 4)132 mins/ 12Cast: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho, Benedict Cumberbatch, Anton Yelchin, Bruce Greenwood, Peter Weller, Alice Eve, Noel Clarke, Leonard NimoyDirector: J.J AbramsPlot: Captain leads a mission to capture the mysterious John Harrison who has started a one- man massacre of the Federation's cities and people. JJ's Verdict: After the 5-star reboot that J.J Abrams gave us in 2009, I was expecting a 5-star follow-up. This is part of the problem. Star Trek was something brilliant, and completely more than just an action film. Star Trek Into Darkness, however, 'is' just an action film. The strange thing is that the opening scenes of Into Darkness lead you to believe it is going to brilliant. We jump straight into the action as Kirk and McCoy are being chased by an alien species and Spock is forced to stop a volcano exploding by jumping into it. These opening scenes are beautifully paced, full of exciting action and of course, contain those much-required human elements. Once we actually get into the film, the main plot is very interesting and leaves you thinking you are about to witness something great. The plot centres on a fugitive, John Harrison, who has taken refuge on a Klingon planet after blowing up Federation buildings and killing many Starfleet officials. From here, Captain Kirk and his Enterprise crew are of course sent to capture him and bring him back to Earth. They eventually do but of course he finds a way to escape and disaster ensues. This disaster I'm talking about actually has two meanings. One is that this Harrison is actually the famous Khan and goes on to try and destroy the crew; and the other is the rest of the film. The film presents us with Khan's master plan, which is actually, one of the most predictable I've ever seen. Because the second half of the film is solely focused on defeating him, you know each move he will make and exactly what the outcome will be. This causes all the action to be meaningless and the dialogue scenes just a distraction. When the best part of your action film is actually your characters bickering among themselves, you know you've got a problem.Of course, on top of the opening sequence, there are some good elements in this film. Like any film of its genre, the visuals are great and as previously mentioned, the character interaction is great. The acting is solid overall with the exception of Simon Pegg who manages to steal every single one of his scenes – even if he only says one line! Like the 2009 film, his comedic timing is perfect. Bruce Greenwood, who reprises his role as Christopher Pike, is the film's bright spark when it comes to serious acting and the only other positive acting is in Karl Urban and the legendary Leonard Nimoy who are dreadfully under-used. The film's only stumbling block in the characters is in Alice Eve, who's posh, edginess fail to fit the film's style, and surprisingly, Benedict Cumberbatch. Apart from the fact that he is miscast as a character supposedly Indian, the British actor portrays his character very one-dimensionally in the first half, and then very awkwardly over-dramatic in the second half. Another problem with Star Trek Into Darkness is that it feels very much like a remake of The Wrath of Khan in 1982. The characters background is told in a way that the filmmakers want you to think of him as a new character. But anyone who has previously seen the older Star Treks will struggle to do so. My most awful and cringing moment of the film, however, was a recreation of Spock's final scene in The Wrath of Khan. This time it is Kirk in the glass and Spock on the outside. I haven't compared them but I'm pretty sure they say roughly the same thing, which it very boring and you know the outcome. It fails to pack the emotional punch it was trying to make. To make matters worse and to plunge this thing in to darkness, Spock screams KHAN! Just totally cringing.",5,4,8,6 July 2013
Madagascar," Bursting with colourful animation
","Madagascar*** (out of 4)86 mins/ PGCast: Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, Andy Richter, Tom McGrath, Elisa GabrielliDirectors: Eric Darnell, Tom McGrathPlot: A group of animals break out of their zoo to reach the wild but accidentally end up on the tropical island of Madagascar. JJ's Verdict: Madagascar is a funny and child-friendly animation bursting with vibrant colours and characters. Its ensemble of recognisable voices add brilliant realism to their characters and makes this film a joy from start to finish.Madagascar centres on animals living in New York Central Zoo, most of which are striving to something greater than being attractions in a zoo. The animals are Ben Stiller's Alex the lion, who likes his status as king of the zoo, Chris Rock's Marty the zebra, who strives to visit the wild, David Schwimmer's Melman the giraffe, who doesn't really care who he is, Jada Pinkett Smith's Gloria the hippopotamus, who is the mummy of the group, a group of secret agent-like penguins who have been trying to escape the zoo for years and two posh monkeys who enjoy reading newspapers and drinking cups of tea. All these characters have clearly defined characteristics, which, for a kid's animation, is exactly what you want. The penguins are particularly funny. They speak in mafia-like voices, make slick movements and a cool piece of music is played whenever they come on screen. After escaping from the zoo, the animals are caught by an angry and violent granny in a wonderfully animated Grand Central Station and then put on a boat to be deported. Not wanting to give up hopes, the secret agent penguins begin a brilliant operation to hijack the boat but after a lot of confusion and animals overboard, everyone ends up on the island of Madagascar. Here they encounter over the top and eccentric King Julien of the Lemurs who is suitably voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen. After gaining the lemurs friendship, the animals have to come to terms with their ordeal and try to escape Madagascar.The film is bursting with unusual and original characters and the animation is both fun and colourful. It is incredibly silly and actually too short (usually today films are too long) as there were definitely more sub-plots the film could have gone into. But Madagascar endless sense of fun will capture children's minds in what is probably the animated film of 2005.",7,0,0,13 July 2013
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Everything a sequel needed
","Ice Age 2: The Meltdown*** (out of 4)91 mins/ UCast: (voice) Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Seann William Scott, Josh Peck, Queen Latifah, Will Arnett, Jay Leno, Chris WedgeDirector: Carlos SaldanhaPlot: Manny, Sid and Diego discover the world is melting and travel to find safety. JJ's Verdict: Ice Age 2: The Meltdown is everything the sequel to Ice Age should be. It improved its weaknesses (better animation, characters looking more alive and emotional), kept its best parts (scrat running after all his acorns, great jokes between 3 mains) and added its own 'extras' (new characters, threatening situations, interesting sub-plots).Ice Age 2 returns us to Manny the mammoth, Sid the sloth and Diego the sabre-tooth tiger who have now become firm friends. Their relationship's start to become strained when they discover that the ice is melting and begin a evacuation process, helping other animals get away. Although in the previous film Sid was portrayed as the weak character, the other two animals face their demons in a much more mature sequel. Diego is frightened of water and, more importantly, Manny believes he is the last of his species and is trying to come to terms with this. However, when Manny does discover a female mammoth (Queen Latifah) she thinks she is not a mammoth but a possum like her two younger 'brothers'. Although her ignorance can be incredibly annoying, it is used to good effect and becomes resolved fairly quickly. Of course the brilliant Scrat the squirrel returns to find more acorns and once again fails to come out with any. He encounters piranhas and actually causes the original meltdown early on in the film. Apart from the female mammal and her two possums, there are some fun new characters. We have Jay Leno's Fast Tony who tries to capitalise on the meltdown by selling survival equipment that obviously will never work and a 'lone ranger' vulture voiced by Arrested Development's Will Arnett who constantly reminds the group he will eat them if they don't escape the meltdown. There are also two ancient crocodile type characters that are constantly chasing the group and put them in fun and exciting action sequences and threatening situations.Ice Age 2: The Meltdown is a near-complete sequel. It may be predictable throughout but not for its target audience. It ends on a heroic and bold note and what everyone wanted; Scrat having one more acorn adventure.",8,2,2,14 July 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Super fun but very OTT
","Fast and Furious 6*** (out of 4)130 mins/ 12Cast: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Jordana Brewster, Luke Evans, Michelle Rodriguez, Sung Kang, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Gal GadotDirector: Justin LinPlot: After discovering Letty is still alive, Dom and Brian help Hobbs take down the criminal she is now working for.JJ's Verdict: The Fast and Furious franchise has come a long way since the first instalment back in 2001. That film was all about cars and racing and its first three sequels followed suit. That all changed with Fast Five in 2011, which was more of a heist film and involved more action and less racing to attract a larger audience. This was welcomed back then, but with Fast and Furious 6, director Justin Lin has made the action bigger; but not necessarily better. Earlier this year, I said A Good Day to Die Hard had over the top action but this film is over the over the top. It is however, unlike that Die Hard, stylish and enjoyable. And although the actual concept of Vin Diesel jumping in the air and while still in the air, head-butting a man twice the size of him, is cool, you can't help thinking it is completely unnecessary and ridiculous. The action scenes themselves had such good editing and precision that it was hard to concentrate on them and it certainly hurt my eyes.The plot itself is a bad one. The idea to resurrect Letty considering she had a funeral and burial in Fast and Furious 4 is totally absurd. It does however not distract too much from Luke Evans' villain Shaw. His character is certainly the most memorable of all previous Fast and Furious bad guys and the Welshman plays it sinister and cold , bringing a fresh air to the scene as the film's only new principal character. Paul Walker's acting has come a long way and along with Diesel, shows off great emotional acting skills which have previously (although attempted particularly by Walker) failed to impress. Tyrese Gibson gets some very funny lines in this one and his chemistry with Ludicrous is nothing short of both brilliant and hilarious. Dwayne Johnson is once again robbed of his hard man status as baby oil and 'Captain America' jokes are made at him constantly.Not only is the action unrealistic here, but the setting itself. Set partly in London, the film depicts London as a street-racing city with races taking place straight through the centre of it. I can assure you that no street racing anywhere near this scale takes place in London and although I don't mind them smashing it to pieces, I wish they could put some realism into it. Another realism point is that if 200 people were watching 3 policemen being beaten up by a criminal, would one of them help them? Apparently not. Fast and Furious 6, although terribly unrealistic, even for an action film, is lots of fun and certainly enjoyable. And to add to the excitement, it gives us a brilliant hint to what Fast and Furious 7 will be like on its release in just over a year.",7,0,2,6 July 2013
Life of Pi," A Visual Masterpiece
","Life of Pi**** (out of 4)127 mins/PGCast: Suraj Sharma, Irrfan Khan, Rafe Spall, Gerard DepardieuDirector: Ang LeePlot: When a young Indian boy is involved in a shipwreck he is forced to survive alone at sea, with only a tiger for company.JJ's Verdict: 'Life of Pi' is one of the most beautiful films I have seen in my entire life. Many viewed Yann Martel's book unfilmable and to perfectly honest it almost is. How can you make a tiger, zebra, hyena and a human be on a single rowing boat at the same time? How can you fill an island with thousands of meerkats at the same time? And how can you have hundreds of flying fish soar past you at once? The answer to all these questions is wizardry. Special effects that look so real and amazing that you can actually believe that a tiger could tear Pi to pieces. The film starts off describing Pi's life from a boy (well narrated by Irrfan Khan) and each of these scenes, from how he got his name, to finding his first love, are made with such charm and innocence. As a boy, Pi starts to discover faiths and ends up being Christian, Muslim and Hindu at the same time. While funny at the time, it brings up amazing philosophical arguments like if you believe in everything, then surely you believe in nothing. Further on in the film, once he has become stranded in the sea, Suraj Sharma's scenes are nothing short of first class. The emotional stress he shows, and how he acts so well with the tiger despite never actually being on set with one. The film also brings up many more questions on life such as dreams and reality.A modern classic, 'Life of Pi' is that rare film that can make you think so much while being entertained by it's stunning visual effects. Ang Lee should be so proud of his remarkable achievement. Unfilmable? Think again.",9,1,3,1 July 2013
Pacific Rim," Desperately needs work on its story-telling
","Pacific Rim** (out of 4)131 mins/ 12Cast: Charlie Hunnam, Diego Klattenhoff, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Burn Gorman, Max Martini, Robert Kazinsky, Clifton Collins Jr., Ron PerlmanDirector: Guillermo del ToroPlot: A 'has-been' pilot and vulnerable first-timer are teamed up to man a robot in the war between humans and sea monsters rages on. JJ's Verdict: After seeing posters and trailers for pacific Rim one would think bad acting, good action. However, it is almost the complete opposite here. In Pacific Rim, we have another silly post-apocalypse story, and although the idea of them coming from the sea is good, this storyline has been overused so many times. Most of the action takes place around ten years after the first alien event with the world almost at its end. To fight the sea aliens, Kaijus, humans create giant robots called Jaegers, which are controlled by two humans whose minds are melted together. The film follows pilots Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) as they try to put an end to Kaiju existence. The plot although seems very complicated is actually so simple that the main character explains it to us in about one minute. Although you would think the film just wants to get this out of the way so that they can show us robots fighting monsters, it doesn't and we are treated to about forty-five minutes of plot-thin arguing and confrontation.The acting is top-notch, especially from Brits Charlie Hunnam and Idris Elba who are in the two lead roles however Travis Beacham and Guillermo del Toro's dialogue is incredibly cheesy and includes every clichéd and over-used line in film that you can think of. Ron Perlman, who plays black market dealer Hannibal Chau, is the film's best feature. Although only on screen for little more than a few minutes, he creates a character you can instantly recognise and gives a superb comic touch to his role. The main attraction is, disappointingly, the film's weakest part. Although it looks like Guillermo del Toro had a blast designing the robots and monsters, the novelty and coolness of them wears off after a few minutes when we still have a whole film full of them. The action scenes themselves, although well set-up, suffer from the same things that Man of Steel's action scenes did. They show little emotion and are so long and dialogue-less that they become meaningless to the viewer. No matter no epic they are, this is a summer blockbuster and you know the good guys are going to win. The action all takes place at night and, although I have nothing against night action scenes, the lighting is poor so you struggle to see what's going on. The noise level these scenes make can be unbearable and you just wish that, at times, you just wish the camera would zoom out so you can get a better look at what's going on.Although it looks good and has a superb performance from Idris Elba, Pacific Rim desperately needs to work on its narrative.",4,5,12,19 July 2013
"Monsters, Inc."," An amazing creation
","Monsters, Inc.***1/2 (out of 4)92 mins/ UCast: (voice) John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Mary Gibbs, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn, Jennifer Tilly, Rob Peterson, John Ratzenberger, Frank OzDirectors: Pete Docter, David Silverman, Lee UnkrichPlot: In Monstropolis, Monsters generate energy by scaring human children in their beds at night, but when one escapes her bed and enters the city, two scarers called Mike and Sulley have to hide her to prevent the rest of the monsters from knowing. Why? Monsters believe children are contaminated. JJ's Verdict: Monsters, Inc. is one of the first films both children and adults can relate to. I can almost be certain that everyone in the world was once sure that there were monsters hiding in their rooms. It is funny, imaginative and full of lovable characters. The city of Monstropolis, unknown to the human world, creates all their energy from the screams of small children as designated scarers creep into their bedroom's every night. What humans don't know is that the monsters are as scared of the children as the children are of them. So when top scarer Sulley (John Goodman) and his assistant Mike (Billy Crystal) accidentally let a young girl loose and into the city, the pair have to try and return her to her 'door' while not letting anyone know how or who let her out.Monsters, Inc. is a magnificent creation from Pixar. The depth of imagination and creativity is a delight and director Pete Docter should be congratulated for one of the most original children's film of all time. Each tiny detail in the animation is so precise and the world of Monstropolis is just breathtaking, as are the small insignificant characters that pop up along the way. It could only be Pixar that can actually create a film that has both hilarious verbal and physical/slapstick humour and it seems everyone involved can such a brilliant time working on the film. It seems like Billy Crystal and John Goodman were actually there in the animation and their characters have such great chemistry. Steve Buscemi is perfectly cast as Sulley's scare rival Randall, a slimy and slithering chameleon, who is always up to no good. Also in the voice cast are Pixar regular John Ratzenberger who plays the actually very nice Abominable Snowman, 'The Great Escape' star James Coburn who plays Mike and Sulley's boss Mr. Waternoose and voice of Yoda and Miss Piggy, Frank Oz who plays Randall's weak assistant Fungus. When people think of Monsters, Inc. they think of Mike and Sulley as the best team-up but the loving relationship between Mike and Boo, the little girl who enters Monstropolis , is the films finest part in terms of emotion, care and utter cuteness. John Goodman really put his all into this film.Monsters, Inc., although very slow is enough to hold your attention and finishes on an excellent final chase scene which is genuinely threatening. Kids will adore it and adults will also love it with amusing pop culture references to Metropolis, Psycho, Tootsie, The Right Stuff, Toy Story, Fargo, Starship Troopers and Armageddon among others. And stay tune for an excellent credits scene.",9,0,1,14 July 2013
Oblivion," Boring.................................. A Missed Opportunity
","Oblivion** (out of 4)124 mins/ 12Cast: Tom Cruise, Morgan Freeman, Melissa Leo, Olga Kurylenko, Andrea RiseboroughDirector: Joseph KosinskiPlot: Jack Harper is a drone repairman working on a post-apocalypse Earth. With only a few days until he leaves the planet, Jack discovers a crashed spacecraft, which leads him to the truth about how Earth was brought to its knees. JJ's Verdict: Tom Cruise has hit a career low in this bore-fest. The first hour of the film just sees him flying around his designated area, repairing drones and talking about boring Super Bowl matches to his wife (Andrea Riseborough, the film's only bright spark). This would be okay if we were treated to an hour of explosive non-stop action after this but we're not. There is more talking and even when the few action sequences come along they are mainly dull and somehow uninteresting. The filmmakers' have taken a good concept and, although made its scenery and effects very nice to look at, put in absolutely no character development. I was going to accept this film when Morgan Freeman came in and delighted us with his presence but his role is little more than a few minutes long. And don't even ask me what was happening in the last half an hour. The film rushed key plot elements meaning the film was extremely hard to follow. A missed opportunity here, and even Cruise plays it extremely one-dimensional.",3,2,4,6 July 2013
Man of Steel," Superman is no longer Super
","Man of Steel*1/2 (out of 4)143 mins/ 12Cast: Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Diane Lane, Russell Crowe, Antje Traue, Harry Lennix, Richard Schiff, Christopher Meloni, Kevin Costner, Laurence FishburneDirector: Zack SnyderPlot: A young Clark Kent is forced to discover his inner-alien when members of his planet threaten to destroy Earth if he does not come to them. JJ's Verdict: The road has been extremely rocky when it comes to Superman films. We have had the good (Superman, Superman Returns), the okay (Superman II, Superman III) and the extremely terrible (Superman IV: The Quest For Peace). To my ultimate disappointment, Man of Steel falls into the final group. The problem with Man of Steel is that although Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder have created a more realistic Superman origin story, they have sucked all the life, emotion and fun out of the Superman franchise. What is so adored about the previous films is that they have a sense of not taking themselves seriously and are just there to enjoy. You got the sense that Christopher Reeve's Superman wasn't taking it seriously either. When Christopher Nolan turned Batman darker and more realistic it wasn't really an issue. The previous films weren't particularly loved by a huge fan base and what worked with Batman Begins is that it is made realistic and believable. Superman, on the other hand, can never be realistic. A man with superpowers coming from a distant planet called Krypton can never be realistic, so however dark and grim they try to make it, it is totally unbelievable and almost laughable. Man of Steel tells the story of Clark Kent, who is actually an alien from the planet Krypton. Clark is forced to discover his alien parentage after members of his race begin to invade Earth. That, I'm afraid is the only story in a whole two hours and twenty minutes. The first hour is just about Clark discovering himself and Lois Lane discovering him. There are lots of long dialogue scenes and no action outside the opening 15 minutes. Then for the final hour we get an action overload with no time to rest or breathe. If they wanted to make an engaging and interesting film, they should have had some action, dialogue, action, dialogue etc. but instead they just tried to pack it all into one part of the film.This action, although decent looking, seems all CGI, bar Henry Cavill's face – yes, even the cape was CGI. Gone is John Williams' charming Superman theme. Instead we have a score from Hans Zimmer, which is probably very good, but the action is so loud and noisy that I could only capture the odd change in pitch or note length. The action itself has even more problems. It is very focused on Superman and never shows us the full scale of villain, General Zod's attack. It is only at the film's end when we see an apocalypse-like Metropolis that you realise the amount of destruction, which leads you to think; did that really just happen?Because the film is an emotionless mess, the acing is of course very mediocre. Henry Cavill puts on a brave face but his acting skills are very-much lacking. The transformation of Lois Lane from a fun, likable damsel-in-distress to a nosey, busybody action star is horrible to see. Amy Adams, although usually good, struggles to work with an underwritten character and in doing so, comes across cold. Her relationship with Clark seems very forced and almost comes out of nowhere. Michael Shannon's Zod is a monotone bore, who shows no effort to try and step out of his one- dimensional baddie role and Russell Crowe's Kor-El is bold but boring and both are a long way from Terence Stamp and Marlon Brando, who previously held those roles.I am happy to tell you that there are a few good parts of this film. Flashbacks to Clark's childhood are extremely moving and emotional as he struggles with his superhero powers. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, who portray his adoptive parents, put in the best performances of the film and you feel their pain along with Clark's. The other standout performance is Laurence Fishburne who gives a quirky take on The Daily Planet's editor, Perry White. Man of Steel will please teenagers who care little about emotion and charm in their films; they just want to see things getting blown up. When questioned why he is saving Earth from Zod, Superman replies with something about loving Earth. He is telling us this, but unlike Reeve's Superman, he never shows his love for the people; only his frustration at being an outcast. And this is the real problem with this supposedly 'fun superhero' film. Superman is no longer fighting for truth, justice and the American Way. He is fighting for himself. Superman, the most iconic of them all, is no longer a super hero.",2,31,57,6 July 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Feel-Good Drama
","Silver Linings Playbook*** (out of 4)122 mins/15Cast: Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver, Chris TuckerDirector: David O. RussellPlot: After spending time in a mental institution, Pat Solitano moves back into his parent's house while he tries to get back together with his wife. He meets Tiffany, a girl with problems of her own, agrees to help him if he enters a dance competition with her.JJ's Verdict: This would be your average rom-com where it not for brilliant performances from the entire cast. 'Silver Linings Playbook' tells the story of two troublesome adults, Pat who was in a mental institute with bipolar after nearly killing his wife's lover, and Tiffany who, since her husband died, slept with everyone she could.Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence who have never really played people who have any major problems, fit into their roles superbly. From Cooper's constant positivity and mood swings to Lawrence's trickery and vulnerability, you don't see two actors on the screen; you see Pat and Tiffany. The supporting cast is equally brilliant with Robert De Niro's OCD and football mad Pat Sr. and Jacki Weaver playing the Pats' mother/wife Dolores. The chemistry between the parents is nothing short of brilliant as they try to keep their son from getting too ambitious. Chris Tucker is also very good as Pat's friend whom he met at the institution as is Anupam Kher, Pat's therapist. Although the film itself feels formulaic, it is amazingly feel-good. To label the film a comedy is a little inappropriate. Despite having funny moments, with the subjects at hand this film is more a drama. But comedy or drama, 'Silver Linings Playbook' leaves you feeling ridiculously happy and satisfied.",7,2,2,1 July 2013
Van Helsing," Unoriginal and Poorly Acted
","Van Helsing*1/2 (out of 4)131 mins/ 12Cast: Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard RoxburghDirector: Steven SommersPlot: Monster slayer, Van Helsing, is sent on a mission to kill the immortal Count Dracula.JJ's Verdict: With nothing original about it, it is unsurprising that 'Van Helsing' is dull and very uninteresting. Featuring Count Dracula, Dr. Frankenstein and his monster, Igor, The Wolfman and of course Van Helsing, all of the film's characters have already been seen a hundred times before. This also means that the plot has been seen a hundred times before. And even its most original character is a clichéd damsel in distress who is somehow good at fighting as well.In this film, Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing is sent to Transylvania to kill Count Dracula. Jackman, although usually very good, is at best, average here. His accent is a mix of Australian, English, American and Eastern European (considering his character is Dutch) and he doesn't show much emotion which leads the viewer really not caring what happens to him.. The action is well held up by a suspenseful score by Alan Silvestri but somehow still manages to be predictable and boring. Only in the end, when there is something to fight for, does the action start to feel fun and inspired. The transition from scene to scene is poor and that is down to some awful sound editing. The film's lighting is also dreadful, so much so that in some of the night scenes you can't actually see half the action. Stephen Sommers dialogue is pretty laughable and makes Kate Beckinsale's acting seem much worse than it is. Richard Roxburgh plays the Count very well but it's just a shame that he is surrounded by a CGI and effects overload. I was also very surprised that 'Van Helsing' was given a 12 certificate by the BBFC. There are some moments of genuine horror and some scenes are extremely (to put it mildly), gooey. The ending is also very soppy but surprisingly unhollywood. Not for anyone under ten, 'Van Helsing' is another remake/retelling/reboot that has failed.",4,1,4,1 July 2013
Now You See Me," Magical Illusions
","Now You See Me***1/2 (out of 4)115 mins/ 12Cast: Jessie Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Melanie Laurent, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Michael Kelly, Lonnie 'Common' Lynn, David WarshofskyDirector: Louis LeterrierPlot: The FBI chase a group of magicians who steal money as part of their tricks and then give it to the audience. JJ's Verdict: Now You See Me is not only about magic; but uses magical distractions and false clues to lead you to believe something is going to happen when almost the opposite does. It creates brilliant illusions through both the camera-work and the acting. Now You See Me is the coolest, smartest, slickest and probably best acted film you'll see all summer. Now You See Me focuses on a group of arrogant, over-confident magicians, called 'The Four Horsemen', who perform amazing tricks involving robbing banks and giving all the money to their audience. But when the FBI finds out about their magnificent heist, the two groups begin a cat-and-mouse chase across the U.S as the FBI agents try to find out how the illusionists are pulling the tricks off – with the help of Morgan Freeman's trick-spoiler, Thaddeus Bradley. The group of magicians, (played by Jessie Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco) although pretty cool, are completely arrogant and laid-back and the FBI agents (played by Mark Ruffalo, Melanie Laurent, Michael Kelly, Lonnie Lynn and David Warshofsky), although more down-to-Earth, are completely stupid and slow-minded. From here we get two groups of characters who both have strong points and both have bad points, so its full marks to the makers of the film that they are given an equal share of the screen time, and the film lets you decide who to root for. 'The Four Horsemen' all have brilliant chemistry and all work extremely well as a unit– you believe they are actually in a group together. Mark Ruffalo, who plays reluctant agent, Dylan Rhodes, puts in the standout performance and his interplay with Interpol agent, Alma Dray (played by Melanie Laurent) is superb. Anyone would forgive Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, both in supporting roles, for almost sleepwalking through this film given their ages and past appearances in films like this. Freeman plays an ex-magician who gives away trade secrets to the highest bidder, and Caine portrays Arthur Tressler, the group's financier. But both give truly strong and emotional performances in roles that would have seemed under-written with a lot of other actors. Each cast member has put their full effort into this and produced an amazing achievement in the process.The film is highly suspenseful and keeps you interested and guessing the final outcome. Each trick is made with visual excellency and are surprisingly given a simple explanation. Although the multitude of tricks and illusions can be hard to get past, once you do get past them you are rewarded with a brilliant, initiative, exciting and original thriller. Those expecting a typical summer blockbuster need to push up their expectations. Now You See Me is full of mysterious turns and includes the finest twist ending I've seen in a long time. It uses brilliant visual and camera trickery not too dissimilar to how the tricks themselves are played out on-screen.Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see.",7,1,5,9 July 2013
Liar Liar," Nice film ruined by Carrey
","Liar Liar**1/2 (out of 4)86 mins/ 12Cast: Jim Carrey, Maura Tierney, Justin Cooper, Cary Elwes, Anne Haney, Jennifer Tilly, Amanda Donohoe, Jason Bernard, Swoosie Kurtz, Mitch Ryan, Christopher Mayer, Eric PierpointDirector: Tom ShadyacPlot: A boy of 5 wishes his father would stop lying and his wish comes true, with varying consequences. JJ's Verdict: Jim Carrey, at his rubber-faced best (or worst if you hate it, like me), manages to create a sweet and loving film that would actually be better off without him. The majority of his films are just vehicles for him with little plot, but this role wasn't written for him and actually has a good plot which Carrey unfortunately distracts you from.Liar Liar focuses on Carrey's Fletcher Redde, a fast-talking and outgoing lawyer who is ready to lie to win his case as quick as a flash. So when he lets down his 5- year-old son (Justin Cooper) yet again, making many lies in the process, the boy makes a birthday wish to prevent his dad from lying for a whole day. This wish comes true without any explanation and becomes problematic for Fletcher as he cannot lie during a case where the woman he is defending is certainly in the wrong. It is kind of ironic for Fletcher that although some aspects of his life go horribly wrong, his relationship with his son and wife improves drastically. Carrey, although he puts a huge amount of effort into the film, is just not funny when he goes into his ridiculous and over-the-top physical humour mode. Although it works when he is playing around with his son, it is just not a normal thing someone would do. He flaps his arms like crazy and pulls off almost impossible facial expressions but I'm afraid he just isn't funny. In fact the only time he is funny, is a scene where he isn't jumping around everywhere but just talking. I wish he would do more of it because he is actually a very funny guy which shows off in the worryingly hilarious credits (worrying because it is probably the best part of the film).Liar Liar is a loving and actually quite cute film, which also gives us some decently entertaining court scenes. It is just a shame its lead actor doesn't suit the role he is given.",6,1,3,15 July 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," Fun and Well-Animated
","Wreck-It Ralph*** (out of 4)108 mins/PG Cast: John C. Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer, Jane Lynch, Alan Tudyk, Ed O'Neill, Dennis HaysbertDirector: Rich MoorePlot: Ralph, the villain of the hugely popular arcade game 'Fix it Felix Jr.', is fed up with being the bad guy so he sets out to become the hero, causing wreckage wherever he goes.JJ's Verdict: 'Wreck-It Ralph' is the best animation from Disney in years. Set in an arcade, the animation brings the whole video-game theme to life. Each game's characters can travel through the wires in the plug socket, which leads to a version of Grand Central Station in which characters from different games can mingle. The whole universe created inside the arcade is subject to unlimited scope and artwork, which is presented beautifully. This being a video-game film of course has hundreds of cameos from famous characters such as Bowser, Sonic the Hedgehog and Pac-man and enthusiasts could literally watch this film just to pick out every single homage and reference to real games and their characters. The film's main character is Ralph (John C. Reilly well voice-casted). Ralph is bigger than everyone else which means everyone is scared of him, which of course means he has no friends. To make matters even worse, being a villain, he always loses. Determined to stop this, he seeks out other games to find a gold medal that would find him accepted as a hero. While looking for his medal he finds an unlikely friend in Vanellope, a glitch. However because Ralph has been away from his game, it stops working, so together the two have to save the arcade from game over. The film really makes you sympathise with Ralph, and although some scenes with him and Vanellope drag on, 'Wreck-It Ralph' is super fun for all the family.",7,2,2,1 July 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Slow But Satisfying
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey*** (out of 4)169 mins/ 12Cast: Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Richard Armitage, Christopher Lee, Sylvester McCoy, Ian Holm, Andy Serkis, Elijah Wood, Benedict Cumberbatch, Graham McTavish, James NesbittDirector: Peter JacksonPlot: Bilbo Baggins, a reluctant Hobbit, is forced onto an unexpected journey with a group of dwarfs to defeat the evil dragon Smaug. JJ's Verdict: As that beautiful Shire music comes bursting in and Gandalf and Bilbo have their legendary 'Good day' conversation, you know that 'The Hobbit' is going to be an expected triumph. In terms of scope and landscapes, Peter Jackson has overtaken his previous efforts such as Lord of the Rings and King Kong. The fight scenes are entertaining and, mainly down to the dwarfs, the film is very funny. At the start of the film when all twelve dwarfs are introduced they barge into Bilbo's home and start to wreck it. This leads to superb fun as Bilbo tries to prevent them from throwing plates around and doing the washing up. And you can rely on them throughout the film to give hilarious comic relief, even when they are about to be eaten by trolls. As well as new characters, we also get to see old (this being a prequel, actually younger) characters. It is a delight to see Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm and of course, Andy Serkis return to their respective roles. The famous riddles scene between Gollum and Bilbo is really something to be amazed at. At almost three hours, it's just a shame that the film struggles to hold your attention for all this time and like 'The Return of the King', has too many endings. Overall, despite lengthy, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is entertaining, funny and brilliantly held together by Martin Freeman, who fits into his role as Bilbo with perfection.",6,0,3,1 July 2013
It's a Wonderful Life," It really is a wonderful life!
","It's a Wonderful Life***1/2 (out of 4)130 mins/ UCast: James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, Henry Travers, Beulah Bondi, Frank Faylen, Ward Bond, Gloria Grahame, H.B Warner, Frank Albertson, Todd Karns, Samuel S. HindsDirector: Frank CapraPlot: An angel shows a charming, likable but frustrated man what life would have been like if he had not lived. JJ's Verdict: What makes It's a Wonderful Life so special is that, although we see what the world could be like if George Bailey never lived, it is so personal. Bailey could be anyone. He isn't very successful or particularly rich, he's just your average everyday gentleman who, like everyone, has touched and influenced so many lives. It shows that everyone has worth in life and that we should never throw that away. In It's a Wonderful Life, we have James Stewart's George Bailey who, like I mentioned before, is your average small-town American gentlemen. Kind, friendly and helpful and always looking out for others around him. This is also his weakness, because he sacrifices so many of his life ambitions like travelling the world to save the local people of Bedford Hills from the tycoon that is Lionel Barrymore's Henry Potter. Because he never reached these goals and spends most of his time fighting off the advances of Mr. Potter to seize the town, he becomes tired of life and extremely cynical. For a man so loved by the local people, George felt very unappreciated for all the sacrifices he had made throughout his life. So when his Uncle Billy misplaces an important $8,000 cheque and the bank examiner discovers this, George begins a rampage across town and finally ends up at a bridge, ready to end his life. However, just as he is about to jump in, an angel appears, ready to show him his life's true meaning and prevent him from going through with his plan. The angel does this by showing George what life would have been like had he not existed. Of course, his family and friends all turn out worse off and the town had been fully taken over and commercialised by Mr. Potter. James Stewart, although very good as the charming but reluctant and living George Bailey, is perfect as the never lived George Bailey, and his scenes where he discovers life without him are emotionally devastating and Stewart makes you feel for his character throughout. Donna Reed is superb as George's loving and caring wife Mary as are the rest of a huge supporting cast that includes Lionel Barrymore, Henry Travers and Thomas Mitchell.Although it's ending fails to create as big an emotional impact as it promises to, (still a pretty good impact but you just expect more) It's a Wonderful Life is an uplifting masterpiece which just gets better on every viewing. Most people say this is the perfect Christmas movie or the perfect movie to watch if you're depressed, but I say the perfect movie to watch anytime and whatever mood you're in.",9,0,4,25 July 2013
Ice Age," Very funny but poorly animated
","Ice Age*** (out of 4)81 mins/ UCast: (voice) Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Goran Visnjic, Jack Black, Cedric the Entertainer, Stephen Root, Diedrich Bader, Alan Tudyk, Chris WedgeDirectors: Carlos Saldanha, Chris WedgePlot: A sabre-tooth tiger, a sloth and a mammoth come together to return a human child to its tribe in the Ice Age.JJ's Verdict: Ice Age is a talky, fun but poor looking animation set in the times of the deep freeze. Although it includes many other animals, the film centres mainly on a charming but vicious sabre-tooth tiger, a lively but irritating sloth and a miserable and cynical mammoth who are forced to join each other in a quest to return a lost human infant back to its tribe.Ice Age is full of brilliant voice work from Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary who all clearly define their animal's characteristics and have excellent chemistry with one and other. This was a must in a film with poor and unrealistic CGI animation that not only gives little effect to the backdrops and landscapes but also gives the characters few facial expressions and emotions.Apart from the main trio, there is also an excellent independent character in Scrat, an acorn- chasing squirrel. Scrat is entirely there to be laughed at and as lightning, an avalanche, and glacier and ice cracking prevent Scrat from his acorns, you can only sit there in hysterics. Although the verbal humour is funny, the physical, slapstick humour can get tiring to watch and most of the 'action' sequences turn out to be somewhat anti-climaxes. Ice Age is an emotionally advanced kids film with very strong themes of friendship and divided loyalty but it's just a shame that it has to come through the voice-actors – not the animation.",7,0,1,10 July 2013
The Wolverine," Ruined by a dire third act
","The Wolverine**1/2 (out of 4)126 mins/ 12Cast: Hugh Jackman, Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, Svetiana Khodchenkova, Brian Tee, Hal Yamanouchi, Will Yun Lee, Ken Yamamura, Famke Janssen, Ian McKellen, Patrick StewartDirector: James MangoldPlot: Wolverine is forced to examine life as an immortal when he is offered the chance to become a normal and mortal human being. JJ's Verdict: The first two thirds of The Wolverine are terrific. It has great entertaining and well- paced action sequences with some actual meaning, but isn't afraid to slow down to develop the characters and storyline. Hugh Jackman gives a strong and more mature portrayal of Logan/Wolverine and the supporting cast shows off some of the best upcoming Asian actors and actresses. It takes a bold leap and tries not to be your typical summer blockbuster. It is a real shame then, that the final half-an hour or so, has meaningless action, silly twists and turns and really just dissolves into generic blockbuster madness. Taking place after the events of the original X-Men trilogy, The Wolverine follows Logan living life alone, still haunted by the death of his lover Jean Grey. But when he is summoned to Japan to say goodbye to a dying old friend, he gets much more than he bargained for. The friend offers to end Logan's immortality by swapping it with his mortality. From here, although Logan rejects the offer, he begins to struggle with the thought of living forever and watching everyone he knows age and die while he continues to live as a youthful immortal. While with his old friend, he gets mixed up in his family threats and arguments as wills and legacies are discussed. And after they remove Logan's healing powers without his consent, he goes on a quest to win it back and save the woman he has fallen in love with.The Wolverine is definitely the most mature of the X-Men films. Although they have all had a dark and sometimes bleak tone, they were never depressing. But here, Logan's obsession with Jean Grey and his struggle with no healing and immortality are a massive part of this film. I, for one, praise the film for embracing these elements of Logan's troubled life. Despite marketing the film for children, adults will probably enjoy it more. Hugh Jackman puts in his most emotional portrayal of Logan yet and ups his character's anger and roughness but still keep the mutant we loved in the X-Men trilogy. Not only does his character develop extremely well throughout the film, but even in the action sequences Jackman is acting instead of just fighting aimlessly. While on the subject of action sequences, the earlier ones are brilliant set-pieces all on a large scale and director James Mangold takes full advantage of the Japan setting to create some truly memorable fight scenes. One scene, which is probably my contender for action sequence of the year, is one on top of a train travelling at 300mph. The camera-work is brilliant as is the choreography and effects to create a very intense scene. The rest of the cast, which is mainly full of native Japanese actors and actresses, is very good. The two female leads, Tao Okamoto and Rila Fukishima, are excellent in what are actually film debuts for both of them. While X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine had too many random mutants, in this film there are only two others in the main storyline of the film. One, Rila Fukishima's fortuneteller Yukio, is brilliantly focused on and developed as she copes with her mutation. The other mutant is Svetlana Khodchenkova's Viper, who is unfortunately the film's weakest character. She comes across as freaky and weird and frankly, you do not wish to see her on screen. Her role in the film is predictable and compared to the other characters, there is nothing to her except being able to spit acid in people's faces.After a mature and dark character study, you would hope they wouldn't ruin it with a lagging and meaningless massive action scene in which each hero is about to die but is then miraculously saved by a friend at the last moment and each villain looks certain to die but somehow they can get straight back up again. It seems the writers ran out of ideas fro the last half an hour so just decided to try and complicate things by having silly and unneeded twists and continuous unrealistic action for about ten minutes straight.The Wolverine is a fantastic character study of scarred man dealing with so many problems in his life. It is just a shame it runs out of steam at the end and presents us with a very poor and film- ruining final act. Make sure to stay behind for a credits scene involving two original trilogy enemies who are credited above.",6,3,9,26 July 2013
The Croods," Surprisingly Good
","The Croods *** (out of 4)98 mins/UCast: Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Katherine KeenerDirector: Chris SandersPlot: After their cave is destroyed, prehistoric family 'The Croods' go looking for a new home in a world of mystery and adventure.JJ's Verdict: After hearing about this film I thought it would be bland, very unfunny and be full of boring voice work. However, coming out of the theatre, I realised it was the complete opposite. The film's animation is full of beautiful landscapes and colourful pre-historic animals, the humour, although slapstick, works very well and the voice work, particularly Nicolas Cage's overprotective Grug, is full of excitement and emotion. The film centres around the Croods who have to leave their cave and discover a new world with shoes, fire and umbrellas. The way they encounter these new objects are extremely funny and probably an accurate depiction of how people reacted to these things so many years ago. All in all, 'The Croods' is the best animated film since the 'Toy Story' trilogy and is perfect for children of all ages.",8,0,0,6 July 2013
Iron Man," Downey Jr. Steals The Show
","Iron Man***1/2 (out of 4)120 mins/ 12Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, Gwenyth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, Paul Bettany, Jon Favreau, Clark Gregg, Shaun Toub, Faran Tahir, Leslie Bibb, Bill SmitrovichDirector: Jon FavreauPlot: After weapons dealer, Tony Stark, is forced to build an iron suit to save his life, he decides to use it to fight back against evil powers.JJ's Verdict: Iron Man is probably the coolest film to grace our screens since Oceans Eleven did in 2001. Iron Man introduces us to charming, playboy, billionaire, and tech-genius; Tony Stark. He is irresponsible and forgetful and would rather spend his time flirting with ladies in casino's than working or receiving a world peace award at a up-town dinner event. However, while showcasing his new weapons, he is captured by Arab terrorists and forced to build an iron-plated suit to help him escape his captures. This makes him more responsible and wary of the world, which leads him to becoming 'Iron Man'. Robert Downey Jr. plays his role so cool and carefree that you almost feel his is playing himself. This isn't a bad thing though as this is an inspired piece of casting from Marvel as the script seemed to almost fit RDJ's blueprint. Gwyneth Paltrow, who plays Stark's loyal assistant Pepper Potts, not only puts in a great performance, but has brilliant, buzzing chemistry with her Downey Jr. Terrence Howard makes a decent buddy to Stark and Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane, although a predictable character, is good as the demanding foster-father to Tony. Also in the cast are relative unknowns Shaun Toub and Clark Gregg who might have just become overnight stars. Toub plays Yinsen, a doctor who aids Stark in his building of the suit, and Gregg, who plays S.H.I.E.L.D agent Phil Coulson.The film itself is actually very good. The film mixes humour with action to great effect. The technology and effects created are marvellous. From the construction of the suit, to the software at Tony's 'bachelor pad' and the dazzling action sequences. The suit itself is well designed and has uses its many functions brilliantly – and thats just the prototype. The music syncs well with the fun action scenes and is in especially good use when Stark flies through t he night sky to the backdrop of L.A. Jon Favreau (also playing Stark's bodyguard) directs this very well considering all his previous directing efforts have been comedies. Although, while trying to be realistic, gets too far-fetched and the film's pacing is poor; Iron Man is one of the best entertainments you'll get in a long time! And also watch out for a brilliant, well worth the watch, post-credits scene with the world's smoothest actor (of course lining it up for a sequel).",8,2,3,1 July 2013
Monsters University," Excellent but links poorly to Inc.
","Monsters University*** (out of 4)104 mins/ UCast: (voices) Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Helen Mirren, Peter Sohn, Joel Murray, Sean Hayes, Dave Foley, Charlie Day, Alfred MolinaDirector: Dan ScanlonPlot: Before they were incorporated, Mike and Sulley had to start somewhere. JJ's Verdict: Although a direct prequel to Monsters, Inc., Monsters University is better viewed as an independent film, which has some links to its original material. This is because Monsters University glorifies the scarers and their scaring when it was of course proved at the end of Monsters, Inc. that more energy can be produced by laughter. Because of this it can feel rather awkward that all the film's characters, especially Mike, are pushing themselves to become the top scarers. Another reason why it links poorly to Inc. is the character continuity. Although we see Mike, Sulley and Randall (plus Roz and The Abominable Snowman in brilliant cameos) it would have been nice to find out how the likes of Fungus, Celia and Mr Waternoose got into Monsters, Inc. Vice-versa, almost all of the characters from University are new creations so of course do not turn up in Inc. It would have nice to see an explanation for their absences or for them to have just expanded on minor characters from Inc. Despite this, Monsters University is still another gem from Pixar which is helped by colourful animation and brilliant voice work from all the cast.Monsters University follows Mike and Sulley as they become Scary Majors and attempt to graduate into Monsters, Inc. However, Mike is a hard working know-it-all but isn't scary and Sulley is scary and a total slacker. Because of their striking differences, they don't get along as much as they would like to. And after a massive argument before their final exam, they are both expelled from the university unless they can win the annual scare competition. Distanced and branded outcasts, the only people who will participate in their team are the very unscary Oozma Kappa monsters. From here Mike and Sulley have to train their misfit team to get through a series of Hunger Games style challenges so they can get back into the university.Momsters University is definitely Pixar's best animated and best looking film but although it is full of charm and well-defined characters, lacks the same mix of humour aimed at both children and adults which made Monsters, Inc. so popular with all ages. Because of this, it won't be able to hold everyone's attention, especially due to the film being overlong. It is also a shame that there aren't as many characters from Inc. but don't fear because Pixar have created a fabulous new bunch of characters. The Ooozma Kappa group are the height of nerds but their actual potential is very funny. One member's controlling mother is one of the film's highlights. John Goodman and Billy Crystal provide superb voice-work once again, as does Steve Buscemi as a nerdy version of Randall Boggs. Helen Mirren, although looks good on paper to voice a strict and overpowering head teacher, sounds like she puts no effort whatsoever in giving her character any redeeming. Mike and Sulley are once again the stars here. The friendship is beautiful as is Mike's unlimited ambition to be the world's greatest scarer. Monsters University is a poor prequel but a very good stand-alone film and the animated film of the year.",8,0,1,18 July 2013
Apollo 13," The way to make a film based on true story
","Apollo 13**** (out of 4)136 mins / PGCast: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd, Miko Hughes, Max Elliot Slade, Jean Speegle Howard, Chris Ellis, David Andrews, Joe SpanoDirector: Ron HowardPlot: Three astronauts on Apollo 13 must survive and return to Earth after the spacecraft begins to malfunction. JJ's Verdict: What makes Apollo 13 greater than the majority of the 'based on a true story' is that the film is a true story. It takes very few liberties (only a few lines of dialogue) and in doing so, creates a genuine and realistic tone, which is certain to entertain anyone because each event depicted on screen actually happened. Apollo 13 is the telling of the true story of three astronauts flying to the moon who are forced to abandon their mission and return to Earth after their spacecraft starts to play up and get rid of the majority of their oxygen supply. The three are forced to go to the most extreme survival techniques as Mission Control desperately attempt to find a way to get the trio back home before it is too late. When watching Apollo 13, the film manages to wipe your mind of any previous opinions you had on whether you believe the story of the moon landings or not. When you are there in that moment watching it, you believe everything the film presents to you. You believe the 1969 moon landings and you believe that the failed Apollo 12 and 13 missions happened by accident; not intentionally sabotaged by the U.S government. It makes you want to find out about the mission itself and the people involved. It is only strong filmmaking that can do both of these to the viewer. From the moment Tom Hanks utters those now immortal lines 'Houston, we have a problem', Apollo 13 is no longer about a space mission. It is about the strength of humans and their will to survive when all seems lost and the worst might still be to come. It is about reflection on what could have been. If they had actually reached the moon. The special effects are so subtle and real that you rarely notice them and you become engrossed in the crew's epic survival; not a special effects frenzy. If modern blockbusters did this then I am sure we would realise how shockingly horrendous they actually are as the wooden acting and poor dialogue and story would have nothing to hide behind. Today special effects are just there to disguise the film's weak points but in Apollo 13, Ron Howard doesn't even want or expects us to look at the special effects. Just the engrossing drama on centre-screen. This isn't to say special effects are bad. The Star Wars and Terminator are films are among my favourite. I just wish we could have more character dramas like Apollo 13 appealing to a mainstream audience and smashing box-offices records, not just effect driven sequels and spin-offs. Not only does it have brilliant filmmakers but also, Apollo 13 is blessed with five of the best actors of their generation taking lead roles. Tom Hanks is Jim Lovell, all-American hero who ultimate goal is to reach the moon, Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert, womanising charmer who is pulled in to Apollo 13 late, Bill Paxton is Fred Haise, arrogant on the outside but weak in the inside, Gary Sinise is ken Mattingly, lonely and insecure who is forced to abandon space program after getting the 'measles' and Ed Harris is Flight Director Gene Kranz, demanding of his co- workers and calmingly confident. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton all bring their own acting style to the equation and are all equally charming at the start but scared and worried at the end. Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects.Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling. Almost all the dialogue is unaltered from actual events as are each and every scene. Ron Howard's masterpiece will leave you sweating in hope, despair and expectation. You'll question how they actually survived, but Apollo 13 happened and what better way to remember it than make a truly magnificent film about it. In fact, Apollo 13 isn't about the events but is the events. A magnificent achievement from everyone involved.",10,2,4,17 July 2013
The Great Gatsby," Stylish Adaptation of F.Scott Fitzgerald's Classic
","The Great Gatsby*** (out of 4)142 mins/ 12Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Isla Fisher, Jack Thompson, Jason Clarke, Elizabeth Debecki, Amitabh Bachchan, Richard CarterDirector: Baz LuhrmannPlot: Bond-seller Nick Carraway, enters the world of his ambitious, big-spending neighbour, Jay Gatsby.JJ's Verdict: When reviewing a film which is based on a book as popular and written about as F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 classic, The Great Gatsby, it is important to not review the plot and story, but the style and method in which it is represented. Despite saying this, the story is one of an epic tale of love, greed, ambition, obsession and tragedy. When mixed together, there is no doubt that your story and film, in this case, is a splendid one.The film centres on Nick Carroway, a former writer turned bond-seller who, after moving into a small cottage on Long Island, becomes fascinated and lured into the lifestyle of his incredibly wealthy neighbour, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby, who has become obsessed with a former-lover, Daisy Buchanan who left him because he had struggled to earn a living, (who just happens to be Nick's cousin), persuades Nick to bring them together. From here, Nick becomes involved in their troublesome relationship which includes his admiration for Gatsby, Gatsby's obsession and life plan for Daisy, Daisy's struggle to choose between Jay and her husband Tom, Tom's troublesome relationship with his mistress, Myrtle Wilson, and Myrtle's working-class life with husband George. Call it a love hexagon!The performances of these famous characters are mainly superb. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a knockout and extremely bold portrayal and, for possibly the first time, becomes completely cemented into his role and is Gatsby. The eventual fall and reveal of his criminal past is handled brilliantly by one of the finest actors of his generation. Tobey Maguire, who has struggled in fulfilling his supposed box-office star destiny since the conclusion of his Spider-Man series, gives a more likable and less showy role than something like Spider-Man 3. He is a wonderful narrator and you certainly feel for his character. Joel Edgerton gives a truly evil touch to Tom Buchanan and Carey Mulligan's Daisy manages to appear angel-like, when she actually isn't. In Baz Luhrmann's adaption of the story, he stays true to the story, but not to the style. This film is bursting with vibrant colours and precise visual detail, which just adds to the whole experience of a brilliant story. The film has a beautiful scope and epic feel to it and the cinematography is top-notch. Although it certainly isn't horrendous, having modern Jay-Z rap songs in the background of Gatsby's famous parties, can feel incredibly awkward at times. Gatsby's ambition, style and brilliant arrogance are an amazing achievement of literature. Now it is an amazing achievement of 21st century cinema. Gatsby is unnecessarily over the top in each and every frame but breathtaking in its masterful storytelling.",8,4,7,6 July 2013
The Proposal," Fun but Formularic
","The Proposal**1/2 (out of 4)108 mins/ 12Cast: Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds, Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson, Betty White, Denis O'Hare, Malin Akerman, Oscar Nunez, Aasif Mandvi, Michael NouriDirector: Anne FletcherPlot: A ruthless boss forces her young male assistant to marry her, so she can avoid deportation to Canada. JJ's Verdict: Like many romantic comedies, The Proposal has a good original concept but ends up just like any other film in its genre. It is clichéd, formularic but benefits greatly from the superb chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. The Proposal is about Margaret Tate, a pushy and ruthless boss who forces her young male assistant, Andrew Paxton, to marry her so that she can escape deportation to Canada. They both negotiate deals in their relationship and after their marriage they decide they will divorce straight after if Margaret comes with Andrew to meet his parents in Alaska. From here their relationship unintentionally blossoms and they discover their true feelings for each other. The match-up of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds is brilliant and their awkwardness is just superb, as is Reynolds' character's complete weakness to stand-up to her and easy to manipulate personality. They attempt to outdo each other throughout the film and it is, in a way, nice to see how their relationship develops. Reynolds' family is suitably embarrassing, especially Betty White's grandma Annie along with Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson's mum and dad. The main stumbling block in this film is not the characters but the lack of plot movement or variation out of the ordinary, which makes way for a slow paced second half of the film. The premise is there but the majority of the film is just 'coincidental' events bringing them closer together. Sandra Bullock although very good as her bossy character, seems strange as a complete character contrast later in the film when her character changing to a loving sympathetic fiancé. A scene in which she raps with Betty White is completely ridiculous and silly.The film as a whole is enjoyable, light entertainment but once again an excellent romantic- comedy concept has been ruined by the filmmakers strong desire to stick to the same old boring formula.",6,0,1,13 July 2013
