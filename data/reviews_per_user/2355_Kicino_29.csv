The Monuments Men," Poor script wastes brilliant cast and fascinating story
","I was drawn by the stellar cast to see this and the storyline looks like interesting. But I was let down from the very beginning.This is by far the weakest script I have seen for a long time. The story is worth telling as art is part of our collective heritage. How Hitler loved art and his subsequent snatching collections over Europe seemed a natural development of his invasion over Europe, but destroying these tens of thousands of priceless artwork when he failed was something the Allies had to stop. This aspect of WWII has not been told and how these brave men from the Allies saved our heritage – tens of thousands of paintings, altarpiece, water color, sculptures and archives - should be a fascinating story – if it was told well. We have an excellent cast to start with - George Clooney (who also directs this piece), Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, and Cate Blanchett etc - all with superb acting skills. But the poor script and plot development scatter them in areas where we neither see their character development nor their passion in art even though they play the roles of architect, museum curator, professors and art historians who are sent to the warfront to save seized art collections from the Nazis and return them to their owners. With these experts' passion in art there should be a sense of solidarity and admiration but we do not see it. The portrayal of leadership and hard work by Frank Stokes (George Clooney) is also very weak.The script structure is very loose and often focus on unnecessary details such as their hasty military training and how they interact with the frontline soldiers. The total positioning and tone of the film is misplaced. Art can be solemn and serious and it can be portrayed in a light-hearted way. Perhaps the producers were trying to create a lighter and comic atmosphere to lighten up the seriousness of art and history but it did not work very well and the audience is always left in mid- air. The way they distilled the troupe of 300+ monuments men and women in real life to seven people is a good try – if they can vividly depict their characters but the film failed to do so. And towards the second half of the movie, showing how the task force discovered the hidden treasure and shipping them are just too bland and hasty. All these pretty faces and excellent acting skills are wasted. It could have been much much better. I can perhaps only remember Cate Blanchet's sexy and strong French accent and her seductive gesture towards Matt Damon when she gives him her only copy of detailed ledger of art collections whisked away by the Nazis. Yet even her repeated line of 'This is Paris' sounds pretentious and unnatural for her character. It is a good intention to tell a WWII story from the point of preserving art and culture how brutal the Fuhrer is toward art, even though it is his interest and passion to loot them all into his Fuhrermuseum in Austria. Some of the haunting scenes, such as barrels of gold teeth from the Jews, and rows of paintings, sculptures and gold bars can be made more dramatic with camera angles and tracking. Another waste. The whole movie was like a buffet with excellent ingredients but poor cooking skills and display arrangement so the whole dining experience is ruined. Lot of sighs. It is in fact quite heart-wrenching to see such potentials wasted. It could have been an otherwise brilliant and amazing story.Purely for your interest, for more details on the real Monuments Men, please see: http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-monuments-men- 180949569/",5,11,16,26 February 2014
Captain Phillips," A tragedy where everyone is just fulfilling his duties
","I went to see this first because it was based on a true story and second because of Tom Hanks. It turned out to be much beyond my expectations and I highly recommend this to all of us who are working hard and wondering if we are doing the right thing. The film opened Captain Philips's routine preparation for his next voyage: gathering his documents, family photo and driving to the airport with his wife. While I had thought about being a seamen when I was young, watching these routine check made me wonder how dramatic this can be. But as soon as the drill began, I held my breath. How could the pirates, though armed, in a small speed boat board such a huge cargo carrier? And once they were on board, what could they do to take control? You really have to see it to believe it. In a way it was like a war movie but our general was a kind and unarmed Samaritan and the seamen were doing what they could think of to protect themselves and their ship. But the meaning it portrays go much further than that.This film can be seen from a few levels: on the surface, it is a pirate story. It chronically describes the hijack and kidnap as it unfolds and we follow all the tension. I sweat with the crew members on board and cheered when the Captain seemed to strike a deal with them. But the escape was narrow and soon we began to worry about the captain, and even the pirates onboard. The cinematography and visual effects is so stunning that you might feel like floating at sea.On a second level, I start to wonder why the pirates act the way they do. What have happened in their lives to push them on this road of no return? They only want to go to New York and lead a better life. Why don't they go home with minimum returns and we just record one more kidnap case? And then we just steer away from the dangerous zone? But if we do that what kind of message are we sending to their relatives and their bosses? Their mother ship was a Taiwan boat they kidnapped last year so it seems they are aiming higher this round. What should shipping companies and marine ministries do with this situation?On another level, I begin to look at the whole issue from a humanitarian level. Yes, the US Navy is strong and the SEALs are great heroes. With their tactics, equipment and manpower, it will be a sure win. Yes piratical activities should be condemned. But who are we to decide to shoot the pirates dead on the spot? Who are we to decide to fool them lock them up in our country when these activities happened in international waters? Do we realize that it is our excessive catching fish that drives their livelihood to desperation, then coupled with their political situation that they have been forced to do things beyond their control? They are, like us, only doing their job. And now we are wiping them out for the second time. Is there other ways out? I am looking forward to watching the documentary 'The Smiling Pirate' which tells the story from pirate Muse's angle. He was ready for a negotiation when he was captured. The accuracy of the film to reality aside, Tom Hanks is excellent as usual. At the beginning of the voyage, he strikes us as a cool-headed leader: calm, prepared, witty and responsible. Then his confidence and trust may have caused him trapped. After days of claustrophobic interaction with the pirates, he finally broke down when he realized that his life is in danger even though help has come. When the military help edging in, he was in conflict with himself – he knew he would be saved and he felt sorry for these innocent people but there was nothing he could do. Tom displayed all these different emotions brilliantly and I was on the verge of crying together with him for his helplessness even after he was saved. It would not be a big surprise if he takes the next Oscar again. Excellent directing in tension building which was enhanced by the background music, tight shots and occasional shaky camera work. But the way it makes us think what kind of world we are living in is the most impressive element of this thriller. Highly recommended.",8,4,8,28 October 2013
Gravity," A Spiritual and Tranquil Ride in Space
","Our earth is so stunningly pretty if we step back and look at it from space. On this enormous big blue marble, we see typhoon, sunrise/sunset, Polar lights, mountain ranges and city lights, all from a different angle. It would have been such a nice ride if not for the accident which causes Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) stranded and roaming in space, with limited fuel and oxygen. There is absolute silence except her own breathe. With loss of gravity (even with it, now we know) human is so fragile. Life is so delicate compared to indefinite space. Yet the will to live can be so strong and powerful – because we have someone we care for and we respect life – whether it is a dog woofing, a baby crying, or a frog swimming. Up there in space, there is no boundaries, no orientation, no nationality or even language barrier. Whatever you believe in does not matter anymore. Whatever we strive or fight for on Earth is not such a big deal anymore. Our hung ups should not be bothering us anymore in that absolute space. It echoed what an astronaut I interviewed years ago who said when you are up there in the space shuttle, you would not think of your national background, just found yourself a global citizen, or resident of the Earth. May we protect and keep our Earth in good shape for future generations to come.In that Zen like drift, panicking does not help. Just be calm, take a deep breath and do what you have to do while enjoying the ride. What a spiritual ride that urges you to appreciate solitude and being alive.Excellent visual effects where we are seamlessly drifting and floating together with them, even inside Dr Stone's spacesuit. The first 10 minutes were all seamed in one shot while we as the audience are also rolling, spinning and flipping gently in space. What an elating experience! How did they do that? This has to be watched in 3D.The sound effects (music and breathing) were also breathtaking which match perfectly with the mood of the spacemen and the edging circumstances.No more worry about whatever that is on your mind. This will definitely give you a new perspective of looking at life and at ourselves. Just go and enjoy the drift.",8,3,5,19 October 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Crazy and stupid but I still love you
","It is so good that I watched it twice in one day. I watched it the first time and really enjoyed it as I was pleasantly surprised. It is like a suspense story with a happy tone. So in a few hours I watched it for the second time and traced the threads and appreciated it more. It is probably the best romantic comedy I have not seen for a long time: it made me cry. It made me laugh (before my tears were dry). Then there were some uplifting and heartwarming messages. The whole cast is just excellent. We need more films like this.Really love this movie. There are three love stories – parent, older kid and younger kid. So the movie will appeal to a wide spectrum of audience. Naturally it addresses three types of love: marriage and fading love interspersed with midlife crisis and adultery, promiscuous and materialistic vs. spiritual and physical love with communication, and youngsters' infatuation (Robby to Jessica and Jessica to Cal).The plot itself is cleverly crafted and twisted yet flows very naturally. The cast were excellent. Everyone is likable even though they might be stupid and crazy. Julianne Moore is good as always but what shines in this movie is Steve Carell who proved that he can really act. I enjoyed the scene when Emily (Julianne Moore) called her ex-husband Cal (Steve Carell) to ask him how to turn on the boiler in the basement when actually she just missed him too much and was using it as an excuse to hear his voice. Cal was just outside the yard secretly helping and was aware of everything but he gladly and touchingly played along. That was so sweet. Another moving scene is when they talked outside their son's classroom about their children and they had tears in their eyes. It makes you wonder maybe they should not have separated in the first place. They should explore what challenges they are facing and try to solve it altogether. Instead Cal did not deal with it very well. But it is so human - men usually do not know how to deal with these emotional things. Jacob (Ryan Gosling) is another character so real in life – materialistic as he was, he was not happy because he had not found true love. He did all the things people did and thought love will come but it did not, until Nana (Emma Stone) entered. Nana was so different from other women - she kept bugging him to know more about him and he finally opened up. What is love anyway? My only complaint about the movie is it did not touch enough on what love is except it never quit. It is not just sex. It is not crush. Maybe it is caring, missing and thinking about each other (Cal and Emily). Or be yourself and not judgmental of others (Hannah and Jacob). I wish we had more comedies like this.",9,2,4,30 May 2012
Begin Again," Just go with the flow and let life inspires you to create
","Begin Again is refreshing, sincere and realistic. I think in certain ways it is even better than Once. Original, authentic and spontaneous. It just flows so naturally and captivating that you are just sucked in and want to experience life with the cast. Mark Ruffalo is great. He is very good at portraying an overworked underdog. Here he plays the role of Dan, an award-winning record producer going downhill in his career because of his personal problems triggered by his divorce. His ex-wife Miriam (Catherine Keener) is also in the music business. As for Keira Knightley, it is probably her best – natural and not too pretentious as her previous work. Still, she could have toned down a little more in some scenes. In this movie she is Gretta, an amateur sing-song writer comes to New York from England with her boyfriend who signs with a big record company. But as fame and the music industry consume him, she painfully realizes their fundamental differences. The best part of the film is the theme/story: how people create music to express emotions and share, not necessarily for fame or money, which easily get in the way of pure artistic creation. On another dimension, it also traces the production and distribution channel of the music business which has evolved into mass participation and authenticity (backup singing or street kids, guitar from the daughter and ambiance) with the popularization of digital technology and the internet. Then we, as audience, also have the same access to creation and sharing. It is also a big slash to marketing and packaging which tend to focus on the looks and images and ignoring the core of the music – the emotions it represents. Of course the third layer is how music bring seemingly love/marriages/relationship together and/or tear them apart. The movie opens with two heart-broken, frustrated and lonely people's encounter through original music. Greta's first song touches on being alone in a city which exactly show how both of them feel at the time. The way she presents herself reflects the rawness but authenticity of her work. So is her advice to Violet (Hailee Steinfeld), Dan's teenage daughter on how to dress to express herself as a real and confident person. The use of imagination and free flow of ideas flows fluently throughout, I especially like the first scene of the imaginary band and production to go with Greta's song.The movie is inspiring in the sense that everyone one of us can be an artist and create, as long as we do it from the heart. And do not worry about making money, because it will come along the way as long as we do a good job. Lots of sincerity and definitely a wakeup call to push us to focus on what is really important in creation and expression, as well as in chasing our dreams and in interacting with our loved ones. Rich and real in music, emotion, relationship, creativity, confidence and go with the flow. Just sit back and enjoy it.",8,2,5,9 September 2014
The Book Thief," A moving odyssey for book-lovers
","I have not read the book but will do so after watching this movie. It is beautifully written, narrated and depicts brilliantly some strong values and noble human qualities by means of film language, which can be enjoyed differently from reading a book.The Book Thief is a story set in Germany during WWII where an adopted daughter, Liesel Meminger (Sophie Nélisse) of a modest Germany family learnt to read with her adopted father Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush). Hans hid a Jewish refugee Max Vandenburg (Ben Schnetzer) in their basement. To entertain Max, Liesel began stealing books from the Mayor's library to keep her new friend entertained. While she was doing that, she learnt to read more and had a better mastery of the language which helped her and her community stick through the war. What strikes me of this film in the first place is how human beings help each other regardless of their race and background and these karma goes on. Hans' life was saved by a Jew in the war so Hans repaid this favor by taking in his son Max while risking his own. Liesel befriended Max and took the risk of stealing books to read to him. Rosa Hubermann (Emily Watson), Liesel's mom seemed to be mean and cold in the beginning but was actually as kind-hearted as Hans. Even the wife of the Mayor turned a blind eye to Liesel's stealing books if it was for a good cause. Most characters are likable and it is encouraging and enjoyable to see them struggling to live a respectable life despite the war and poverty.It is also because there are something more important in life than mere survival – eg parental love, friendship, music, books, and imagination. Liesel evolved from being illiterate to being able to use language to describe her surroundings in poetic terms was a big triumph. She also put these skills in positive use when they were trapped in the shelter for the air raid. Language is important in expressing our feelings, opinion and narrating our environment, thus helping us to connect with one another. In Max's case, it was reading that kept him alive! Human may die but our opinions, values and insight will stay on, by means of language. In that way, we can be immortal in a way.Yet no one is as immortal as Death. It is interesting to have Death as the narrator in the beginning, at some important moments and at the end. It frames the whole story and put everything in perspective: fairness to all. It also gives a sense of detachment and objectivity. Since we are all going to die, what should we do to make our lives more worthwhile? As Death said, Liesel has shown us what it was to live. The characters and plot development is engaging. Sophie Nélisse is so cute, pure and so good with her eyes. I have seen her in Monsieur Lazhar, a story with an illegal immigrant turned teacher, and was already impressed by her acting. All the other supporting cast are good too. There are some very moving scenes and I cried. You will cry too when you empathize with the characters in the movie. I am sure I will probably cry more when I read the book. But it is OK if it gives me more hope on life and humanity.The Book Thief is such a good movie with positive messages that I wish more people could see it. But its publicity is very minimal and I almost missed it. Definitely recommended.",8,1,3,9 March 2014
American Hustle," Great character development, interesting plots and witty lines based on true events
","I love movies based on true events. American Hustle is more than that as it is also filled with character development revolving around interesting plots and witty lines. What's more, it leads us to question our basic assumptions in addition to bringing us black humor. I highly recommend this thought provoking comedy.The main characters are not lovable but they are all fun to watch and brilliantly portrayed by the excellent cast. The plot is basically some schemes in the 70s and the FBI arrested two cons and used them to attract more cons in politics.Christian Bale put on 40 pounds to play Irving Rosenfeld, an experienced but unattractive con since his childhood. Irving meets smart and sexy Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) at a party and decides to team up as partners, in business and in private.But Irving actually has a passive-aggressive wife Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence) with a son whom he cannot leave. Rosalyn, though self-proclaimed socially handicapped, effortlessly becomes the center of attention in any social gatherings. When suspicious Rosalyn overhears Irving's phone conversation with Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), she invents many stories in her head which ultimately affected everyone's fate.Because Richie is a neurotic and impatient FBI agent who tries to leverage on Irving and Sydney's con skills, even though it means ridiculing his supervisor. Dragging into the scene is New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) whom is set up to lure more congressmen into a trick involving the mafia although he, a happily married politician, has been working very hard for his community.Dotted along are some hit songs from the 70s which make the whole experience so nostalgic. Full of surprises in cast, lines and plots, American Hustle is very entertaining to watch and urges you to question your normal logic, making you more critical in interpreting the news and whatever that is happening around. Totally pleasant to watch.",8,3,5,3 February 2014
Nightcrawler," Haunting journalism violates morality
","Jake Gyllenhaal makes this alive. He is such an excellent actor, seriously shedding a lot of weight to do this movie. What is left after I walked out of the theater was his bulging eyes blinking like an owl and his chilling smile.A desperate but fast learner, Luis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) accidentally finds there is a lot of money in crime journalism and invests his time and talent in this line of work, even if it means crossing the line of using other people or violating the basic principles of journalism in checking facts and being objective.His bulging eyes can be scary sometimes. But what is more disturbing is the way he talks – it is fluent, relevant but strictly business like. The monotone though relatively high pitch is almost like a computer generated business textbook which stress teamwork, communication, striving for excellence and all those BS. He seems to take it very seriously. He is observant and is a fast learner. But he does not have a heart. Or morals. I would not want to be his friend. In fact, he does not seem to have any friends, perhaps because he is so manipulative. I cannot say he is selfish because he was using his business as a shield. But he is sick. Even his smile is haunting. A very strong character development and smooth direction.It is also appalling to see how sensational some TV news can get. With the advancement in technology, we can easily achieve an abundance of graphic images. But in this process, we seem to have lost sight in in- depth analysis and background research, let alone applying ethics in reporting and checking facts. It is horrifying how some paparazzi type of freelancers are out there doing their job and ruining professional journalism. But that would not have happened if TV stations buy their work. And TV stations would not have bought them if it did not help the ratings. After all, certain type of audience drives certain kind of news. It is disheartening the news director pushes for these graphics which gradually jeopardizes an otherwise would-be tasteful audience. That in turn could shape our society into a heartless mess. Great wake up call.",8,0,1,10 March 2015
We're the Millers," Relax and enjoy the ride
","What a delightful and naughty comedy with a political correct ending! A very creative plot and script with excellent cast make this movie very enjoyable to watch. And unlike other comedy, you may even get a message out of it.The punches are unexpected and work very well. I keep laughing while admiring the wits of the writer. I would not divulge too much details but let's just say a group of losers (perceived by our society) pretend to be a family to cross the border to Mexico to transport some weed back to the US. Each of them go on board for different reasons and as the movie progress, the role playing become real and these people are not as unpleasant as they appear to be. Specially worth mentioning is Jennifer Aniston who played the part of a broke stripper and pretend to be a mother. Boy is she hot. Her character is strong too. She also dances very well – which almost made me want to be a stripper too! Jason Sudeikis played the part of an egoistic drug dealer but then we gradually discover he is not that bad a guy. All the team members seem to grow throughout the experience as they become a real team. What a feel good movie that is not corny. Go see it with an open mind. You will not regret it.",7,0,1,16 October 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," If you read the signs, there are always silver linings
","It was such a pleasure watching this movie which is way better than I expected. I laughed, I cried and I am inspired. Leaving the cinema, I felt great, warm, and blessed. What a good script with great acting and uplifting messages! Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro are simply adorable – how can you be funny, troubled and yet loving at the same time? But they did it - with the help of a very strong supporting cast. Jennifer Lawrence is young but promising, also very convincing to play someone with problems!Even though Pat (Cooper) has bipolar disorder and needs medication, we can't help feeling empathized with him despite the fact that almost all characters in the movie are crazier than he is! This is so ironic and close to real life. But then it was OK if we are a little stressed out at times, as long as we have a strong supportive network and ways to release pressure. For Pat, it was running, reading and working at getting back with his ex-wife whom he is obsessed with and becomes his drive. For Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), it was dancing (and more?). For Dad (Robert De Niro), it was watching the Eagles and mending the relationship with his son. The sincere and yet hard-to-express father-son relationship was beautifully portrayed. Ditto the caring between friends and families. Yes, there maybe little lies here and there and not telling everyone everything. So what? Be forgiving! Don't sweat the small stuff! In the end, we learned that whatever we say may not matter if you have good intentions. Step back and look at the large scheme of things: watch the actions, read the signs, do your research, and be positive. You will see the silver lining and get what you want when you work hard at it. What a feel good movie. It will brighten up your day after you dry your tears and laugh your lungs out. Go see it.",8,0,0,22 February 2013
The Intouchables," Extreme lightness of heavy being
","What a heartwarming comedy on a serious subject for a long time! What's more important is that it is a true story. That makes you feel more positive and hopeful about life.Both Philippe (Francois Cluzet) and Driss (Omar Sy) are like the untouchables whom no one wants to have anything to do with: Driss, came from Senegal to live with his aunt, is strong and big and black. He is just released from prison after a six-month term but he is not wanted even in his own home in the projects; Phillip is a white, rich and widowed aristocrat who is paralyzed from the neck down from a paragliding accident. His love for loud opera and demand for tedious care turns off many carers. Both of them have reached the bottom of their lives. When they finally meet, the opposite attracts: they finally see a way out as both of them offer each other a completely different perspective on life which turn both of their lives around.Philip introduces a world of opera, classical music, art, paragliding, lost love, flowery language and repressed emotion. He does not want pity and feels helpless about his condition. He is good at being thoughtful and offers ultimate material comfort. Driss, almost illiterate, is rich in kindheartedness and has a simple outlook of life while respecting others. He questions the value of art, ridicules opera and makes fun of classical music. He introduces rap music and dance, direct confrontation, threatening by little violence, direct expression of love, pot and massage. He is great at making the best of what he has. The link between them was respect, genuine care and a wide open mind. Even though they come from totally different worlds, they learn from each other with a very open mind and eventually forge a strong and supportive friendship.The fact that the film is based on a true story makes it even more darling and heart-warming because in real life, without the genuine open-mindedness, respect and sincere care for others, this wonderful friendship and support would never have happened. This is a perfect production on all counts: acting, script, direction, music and editing. The lines are beautifully crafted and comically delivered by both excellent actors. While Sy can use his whole body to show his extrovert and outgoing personality, Cluzet mainly uses his face and eyes to act. Yet both are magnificent and the sparks between them really dazzle. The score is simple but powerful. The monotonous piano solo reminds me of the scores from 'Tree of Life', but here it sounds a little sad and a little repetitive like the monotony in life. It also shows the gradual change in real life: everything, be they good or bad in life, will phase out and all we have to do is to enjoy every moment while we can. Being wheelchair-bound and unable to move/feel from the neck down can be heavy and depressing. But if we can take it easy like Driss does, life is full of nice surprises and fun. Highly recommended.",8,2,3,7 September 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," A Marginal Man's Transformation Brings Hopes to Humanity
","It is a great movie. I thought Leonardo DeCaprio would win the Oscar before I saw this but now I am not so sure. Matthew McConaughey is so convincing in transforming himself into an AIDS patient who never quits fighting for his own life. He even walks like such an unlikeable character: a swaggering womanizing drug user who works as an electrician. His stares, snarls, swears, and care are all so impressive. Based on a true story, The Dallas Buyers Club tells us how Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), after being diagnosed of AIDS in 1985 and only had 30 days to live, refused to wait to die but chose to fight head on with the disease, the medical community and government bureaucracy to obtain/smuggle pharmaceutical drugs that worked for him and other patients like him. What I like about the movie is the spirit Ron Woodroof represents: he never quits and he never takes no as an answer. He is smarter than he looks. Initially denying his condition, he researches into AIDS, how people got it and what is being used to treat the disease. He lives around the system to survive on the edges. But he is not just surviving. By the end of the movie he has transcended his battle for mere existence/surviving into selflessly helping those in desperate need as he is. There is a sense of admirable quality in him despite his promiscuity and abuses in drugs. Countering the plight of his rapidly diminishing life amid an incurable disease has overshadowed his homophobia and the chase for monetary reward. His desperation has driven him to work around, inside and outside the system, thus challenging the inflexibility of law and bureaucracy. Ron is a gambler throughout the movie, from hustling bets on the rodeos, to trafficking unapproved drugs from Mexico and bribing officials and professional to get what he wants, to setting up a group to supply unapproved but workable drugs to patients who need them. He has tremendous confidence and uses whatever works to get what he wants. All through his life, he energetically grips very tight control on his life, just as he holds tight onto the rodeo.This is essentially a story of the marginal people. Ron and his transsexual partner Rayon (Jared Leto), together with the Dallas Club Buyers members, mostly gay, were shunned by society in the mid-80s when AIDS was first discovered. Being diagnosed with AIDS with limited knowledge on its association with the gay community and few effective medicine available, they were never taken seriously by the mainstream society even though their lives were threatened. Yet, through Ron and the hard work of his club, we can see a respect for humanity regardless of people's lifestyle and sexual orientation. While the real Ron's sexual orientation is unclear (perhaps for marketing reasons and dramatic effect, Ron is portrayed in the film as strictly straight and even flirts with his doctor), the film portrays a natural yet convincing shift of an angry, redneck homophobic into a diligent researcher/experimenter who put his own life on the table. Spotting a chance to make money, he begins to work closely with the gay community. As their deterioration slow down he feels more confident of his own way of combating the disease. Yet when his partner eventually dies, either from the toxic new medicine or his own abuse in drugs, Ron realizes that death is the final equalizer therefore even financial difficulties of the club is not a problem anymore. At this juncture, we can see, and as Ron tells us, he does not merely want to live, but also leave a legacy during the limited time he has on earth. For that it is admirable. Excellent performance of Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto who shed 47 and 30 pounds respectively for their roles. Bravo to the journalist who interviewed the real Ron Woodroof a few weeks before he died which inspired producers to make this movie. Hats off to the producers and script writers who turned such a depressing and misunderstood matter into an encouraging crusade of humankind. If we believe life is beautiful, then law, bureaucracy, business, and medical research should put human's wellbeing in the utmost priority. Our protagonist has vividly demonstrated this. Must see.",8,3,4,25 February 2014
Inside Out," Fun, sad, education and inspiring at the same time: a creatively educational and emotional animation
","This is probably the only animation that I cried throughout. I cried while watching Up and some of Hayao Miyazaki's animation but this one somehow moved me with some very raw emotions. I was weeping and laughing while being educated/inspired at the same time.Even when I saw the pre-animation song on Lava I felt like crying because the emotion was so sincere yet sad despite the relaxing Hawaiian style of tune. The story is mainly about young Riley has to leave her hometown in Minnesota and move to San Francisco with her parents. During this transition she is sad to leave her friends and seems to have a hard time fitting in the new environment. The movie tells us how her emotions helped her deal with this big change in her life and how she can her family cope with the new environment.I had no idea why I cried but whenever I saw the faded baby pictures and memories I cried. I like how different emotions in each of us are introduced and they all seem to have certain roles. I think it is very educational to see how our brain works – with different emotions taking turns dominating our thinking. Then the memories and experiences get together to form some islands which are our support systems. The movie uses very lively, tangible, and colorful balls/characters to symbolize some very abstract concepts and hard to see nerve systems so it is easy to follow. Watching the memories being sucked in tube and flying around I felt like watching the neutrons dashing within our brain via our nerve system. While we usually values Joy, Sadness has a reconstructing effects on us too because when we are too sad, we need support and build something positive on our sad memories. That's how we have grown and become what we are today. It is also how we build our support system which hold us up. I love this movie too much. The five emotions, core memories, the island/personalities and subconscious are really cute and fun. It is almost like going into someone's brain and see how they operate. In fact, everyone has a console like that and it was really fun to see the dinner scene when Riley was upset and Mom notices it and tries to signal to Dad to ask/comfort her. Too many stories to tell from this short scene: that women are more observant and sensitive but man are usually pre-occupied with one single thing at a time. They also have a tendency not to express themselves very well which makes matter worse. The train of thought is interesting too as the emotions goes around to look for Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong to call for support. But why do we have to let him die? It is so sad. All in all, the main theme of the story is for us to be more aware of our emotions, be comfortable with them even though they may not make us feel good. Because only when we acknowledge our emotions can we then figure out why we feel that way and how we can deal with it and move on. Also, it is OK to tell others how we feel, it is how we receive support and mutually bond and grow stronger together. I wish the other emotions play bigger roles in the movie because obviously they - Anger, Fear, and Disgust - protect us in their own ways too. Stay for the end credit which is interesting because it shows everyone's brain and how they help us cope with reality.",9,1,19,7 September 2015
The Fault in Our Stars," Youngsters in an imperfect world show us how to live life to its fullest
","I am so glad I saw this though it appears to be a tear jerker. Well it may, but it also gives you lots of hope. It flies in all accounts: perfect story, script, casting, acting and inspiration. I cried and laughed and felt satisfied even though I was not sick. We can learn so much from kids and yet these are not really kids. As young adults they have the purity and positive drive of kids who just live for the present and seize the moment. Yet on the other hand they are about to become adult and have the maturity to love and care for the people they deeply love/look up to/admire. Beautiful story setting. Very realistic and positive outlook for life. Inspirational for all ages and of all conditions. Life maybe short but still good. It is important to vent and have a support system who accepts you as who you are and on your side at all times. Excellent casting and acting, especially the three youngsters who have to brave cancer. Guz (Ansel Elgort) is so charming with his sincere smile that you just want to hug and kiss him. Hazel (Shailene Woodley) is very cute and sweet and had a great sense of humor. She also displays a strong sense of confidence. Yet when they weep you really feel the ache inside them and cry with them. Even when Issac (Nat Wolff) loses his eye and has to wear sunglasses, his facial expressions made me cry. But it is not a sad story. Death is all around us. We are all going to die. Yet before that day comes, we have to live well and full and have a good laugh about it. These teenagers with terminal illness show us exactly how to do it. As mentioned in the movie, pain demands to be felt. So is love, sadness, anger and all kinds of emotions because they are what make us human. No need to worry about whether we would be remembered because we would not know then. Let's focus on this life.Have not seen such a good movie for a long time. I would give it an 8. Really looking forward to read the book.",8,0,1,8 September 2014
Non-Stop," Exciting, thrilling and therapeutic amid a real plane's disappearance
","As I write this, the Australian satellite has spotted some large debris floating on the Indian Ocean but their planes cannot find anything related to the missing Malaysian airline Boeing 777 which went missing Mar 8 while en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur.I watched Non-stop for two reasons. Firstly, it has been more than a week after we lost a huge plane with 239 people onboard. No trace of debris and no communications found so far. Hijack? Terrorist attack? Mechanical failure caused explosion or decapitation? Abduction? Just very mysterious. Watching this seems therapeutic and relevant. We might even get some insight on what could have happened. The second reason is of course the ever enchanting Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore. The third reason is perhaps as an occasional flyer, we may learn something new in preparation for our next flight. Well, the first goal is easily achieved: we are well aware that we would be safe at the end of the 2-hour movie, however gripping it is. Imagine how long the real passengers suffer? I feel sorry for passengers on a hijacked plane who must be scared to death with all the tormenting uncertainty. Or the sudden and unexpected death in the case of a mechanical failure.In this film, Air Marshal Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) receives text messages on the plane from an unknown person telling him one passenger will die every 20 minutes until $150 million is deposited into a specified account. Like our Malaysian airline, this place also diverted. Watching it was if we have a new perspective in deducing what could have happened in real life.Marks cannot announce this info but has to make quick decisions to identify this person. Passengers are kept in the dark but are told to have their hands on the seats in front of them, or their hands up, or move to the back. It must be very stressful for them and the director did a great job in creating a prolonged suspense. It is like an Agatha Christie story in mid-air where we begin to suspect everyone. It is very exciting to watch and yet comforting to know we are safe in the theatre. All the suspense is nicely built but the ending seems kind of abrupt and unconvincing. Then there are many plot holes and loose ends in portraying the flight situation and security check. But the excellent acting of Liam, Moore and the supporting cast compensated all these. Not a great movie but a relevant and therapeutic one at the right time. May we locate and find out what happened to the missing Malaysian plane soon.",7,1,3,20 March 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Ultimately enjoyable movie experience: worth watching again
","For me, it needs two viewings to fully appreciate it. Maybe I was too tired and too preoccupied in the first show. The second viewing helps me appreciate the picture much much more. It is like a very tightly-knit symphony. Every note, every frame, every line is carefully crafted and precisely shot. Perhaps with a background in advertising, director Wes Anderson is very conscious of his airtime. Watching this film turns out to be a very rich movie viewing experience – visually and graphically, in background music and of course the animation-like exaggerating acting. But the most important is the positive message on humanity. What a pleasure to watch. Maybe the fast pace, long dialogues plus reading the subtitles made it hard to follow the first time. In the second viewing I focused on listening to the dialogue while watching the facial expressions and noticed the precise moment when the music entered. I also appreciate more the overall presentation and organization of the plot and the script which you'd better experience it yourself.The swift mood of the whole movie has a style that resembles Charlie Chaplin's movies, as if it is running slightly on fast speed. Even the love/respect for the ordinary people are also comparable. The loud color scheme, the bold use of red and the spacious portrayal of a huge hotel remind me a little bit of Stanley Kubrick's classic Shining, except this one is a comedy with a warm and humanistic respect for the profession of the concierge.The whole layout of the movie is like a set of Russian dolls where we open one layer of story and find more layers inside but there is a thread linking them throughout. Here we have four layers in total that goes back to a century. Starting from the beginning, we see a young woman carrying a book entitled 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' when she visited the grave of the author. Facing the audience, the author (Tom Wilkinson) tells us what he writes is always based on true events. Going back to his younger days in the 60s when he (Jude Law) spent a month at the hotel, he bumped into the owner Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) of the hotel, a very rich man who once worked there as a lobby boy (Tony Revolori). And here the core of the story begins.An immigrant escaping war from his country, lobby boy Zero started his training by the popular and legendary concierge Mr. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) in the 1930s. A devoted and professional concierge, Mr. Gustave inherited a valuable painting from one of his rich clients (Tilda Swinton) after she died. When Mr. Gustave and Zero went to her house for the service, a whole series of accusation, arrest, trial and chase begins. The story is not hard to follow but be sure you are alert because the editing is so precise that you need to be very attentive and literally cannot blink/slip too often. Watching the various stars, including Adrian Brody, Mathieu Amalric, Owen Wilson, Saoirse Ronan, Léa Seydoux, Bill Murray, Edward Norton and Harvey Keitel, a few of them Oscar winners, is such a pleasure. None of them except Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori have a lot of screen time but all of them are impressive with their limited exposure. The animation tone throughout the movie makes it look almost like a cartoon played by human and it is really fun. It was not until I watched the second time that I realized many details have already been planted in the early part of the movie. It is just overwhelming in the first viewing because the dialogue is fast and long, the tempo swift and editing sharp. So many senses have to be employed at the same time that I was just too busy to merely follow, let alone appreciate the production.Similar with the Russian dolls where the same pattern stays throughout different layers, the theme of anti-war, bonding among the professionals and passing on the heritage of humanity (take over) across nationality linger on for years. Even the end credits is a breeze to watch with the exciting balalaika playing and a little animated Russian guy dancing. Totally enjoyable. Highly recommended.",9,5,12,28 March 2014
Gone Girl," Brilliant plot and meticulous direction depicting twisted love story wrapped in a thriller
","Gone Girl is so enticing that I watched it two times. Then I read the original and found there are even more details not shown in the movie which could have made the movie a little more complete.In terms of the movie, it excels on all counts: script, direction, acting, music and editing. A totally thrilling experience with many twists and turns while giving you some slacks to reflect on love/marriage and the role of media in our society. A great movie. Good pacing and capturing from the start: Ben Affleck is quite good in portraying the frustrated, mediocre, and frightened husband Nick Dunne who is just human: a simple-minded kidult who might occasionally be naughty but way less controlling, calculative or manipulative. A writer in New York, he moves back to his hometown in Missouri with his beautiful Harvard-graduate wife (a New York native) to care for his dying mother. After his mom died, they stay on and he teaches writing at a community college.His beautiful wife Amy (Rosamund Pike), also a writer in New York, is missing on their fifth anniversary. But Nick seems to be too relaxed to the Police. Evidences begin to emerge, suggesting that Nike may have killed Amy. Nick denies repeatedly. The drama starts with two parallel lines: Nick's search for Amy in real life and Amy's narration of their marriage through a diary. These two descriptions merge half way and more surprising drama follows. Without giving too much details and spoiling the suspense, let's just say it is very enjoyable to follow the development. To me, it is always engaging to see how smart Amy is molded into the way she becomes by her psychologists parents. Ever since her childhood, she has been living in an illusion. It is tragic in a way because she cannot face her real self. Nick is manipulated by multiple forces in the movie as if he is a victim. It is almost comical to see how the media sneers at the underdog and how we could turn the situation around if we know how to play the game and change public opinion overnight. But then we could also be trapped by the image we created for ourselves. It is very interesting how the gender is contrasted in this movie: three main female characters - Amy, Nick's twin sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and the detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) are brilliantly portrayed with confidence and intelligence. Even Amy's mom and the TV anchorwomen are strong personalities who like to take charge. On the contrary, Nick and Amy's ex-boyfriends appear to be victims of some sort, either because men generally do not think clearly when it comes to women or some women are just too dominant As for marriage, Amy and Nick seem to be the perfect couple until things turn sour when they show their real self. Their relationship is portrayed as a lifelong torture with endless deceit, mind games and mutual manipulation. They both pretend to be someone they are not really are to get what they really want. Pathetic and ridiculous at the same time. The accompanying score is perfect in expressing the mood of the characters and the urgency of the plot development. The direction is great as the details are carefully paved and punchlines neatly paced so you would be awed and chuckle alternatively. Not a single frame is wasted and the 149 minutes drift by swiftly. The novel gives more background on character motivations and tie some loose ends in the movie.The overall achievement is so good that I would not be surprised if Gone Girl receives multiple Oscar nominations/prizes, especially Best Actress, Best Direction, Best Script and Best Score. The original novel is equally enjoyable.",9,0,5,10 November 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," An awesome adventure powered by romance and suspense
","It was much better than I expected: I thought I was going to watch a goofy comedy but it turned out to be an uplifting story that combines adventure, fantasy, romance, suspense, and even inspiration all packed with excellent visual effects. Thoroughly enjoyable. Great work! Salute to Ben Stiller!I especially like the opening credits when Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) comes out from his drab apartment, almost drowning in the anonymous colorless city, looking for some type of life which only seems to exist in his fantasy. It pretty much sets the stage for the forthcoming adventure filled with vivid colors shot in wide angles. This film has to be watched in the cinema unless you have a huge screen TV.A tight script which essentially says it is OK to daydream because that's where our energy and motivation comes from. Ben plays the role of Walter Mitty, a middle-aged, nerdy and introvert singe man who has been managing negatives for the LIFE magazine for the past 16 years. The magazine is closing down to make way for the digital version and Walter has to look for a lost frame of negative which a long time contributor has designated for the cover of the final issue.There is lots of respect for underachievers throughout even though they might be low-keyed and seemingly unreliable, but may actually be too insecure to show their talents. Thus it is quite comforting and relieving to watch for underdogs like me (and/or you?). Ben Stiller is not a great actor but the directing is great and artistic direction very creative and stunning. The cast are great. Sean Penn is superb! His brief appearance is so powerful since the previous buildup and suspense have well paved way for it. Kristin Wiig who plays Ben's muse Cheryl Melhoff is sweet and engaging. Shirley MacLaine also has limited air time but she is strong in portraying a caring mother about to go to a nursing home. Even Todd from eHarmony (Patton Oswalt) steals the show when only his voice appears in the beginning. Totally pleasant except for the maybe too obvious commercials but it is alright since they are not available here. The motto of LIFE magazine in the movie, 'To see things thousands of miles away, things hidden behind walls and within rooms, things dangerous to come to . . . to see and be amazed,' could very well be OUR life motto: dare to get involved and feel. Start by watching a feel good movie like this. It will make your mind wander and wonder.",8,0,3,7 January 2014
22 Jump Street," Great chemistry between duet in entertaining comic script
","I liked it so much that I looked for 21 Jump Street when I finished seeing this. The poster looks like a stupid comedy but I like Jonah Hill after Moneyball and The Wolf of Wall Street. And Channing Tatum looks so cute in Magic Mike that so I went to see this. Well, all I can say is it exceeds my expectation of a Hollywood comedy. After watching three movies featuring Jonah Hill, I can confirm that he is an excellent actor. His acting can probably carry him to a level more than just comedy. In 22 Jump Street, Hill is unbelievable in playing the role of Schmidt, an insecure, jealous, hardworking and loyal teammate. His body movement and voice impersonation is impressive. Even his blinks and murmurs are effective.The story can be calculative, crafted and is tailored-made for Tatum, who plays a curious cop Jenko, factoring in his model physique, Kungfu skills and football expertise. But boy is he hot and surely he makes me wow. Simply dazzling. The chemistry between Hill and Tatum is quite strong and they really sparkle when they are together – even though Tatum needs more work on his acting. What distinguishes it from other American comedies is the interesting script which has many layers in addition to the undercover cop duo going to college. There are lots of twists to the script, in addition to the action scenes and comical moments, making the watching experience enjoyable throughout. Even the end credits are interesting to watch. Never a dull moment in this fast-paced action-packed crime comedy touching on homosexuality and brotherhood. Quite a relaxing movie to watch.While I look forward to 23 Jump Street, I am kind of hoping they will change the selling points a little and move away from football and half naked Tatum, etc.",7,3,8,16 September 2014
The Imitation Game," Tragic yet inspiring story of a man covering his own secrets while cracking more secrets
","The Imitation Game, based on the true story of Mathematics Genius Alan Turing, is captivating and excels on all accounts, making it a totally enjoyable movie experience and conducive to reflect on our own lives. It is the story of a man, while covering his own secret, spending all his life unlocking national secrets to save the lives of others who eventually put him in torture. His own life is an enigma. How ironic life is! Alan Turing is such a genius in mathematics and founder of the computing machine but also very awkward in social situations. He is absorbed in his own world, cracking codes since he was a teenager. He is also a philosopher with his own sets of logic – aware from a young age that people do not say what they mean but hope others will understand their symbols/codes. Being bullied at school and at work because he is different, Turing has developed tremendous resilience to resist violence while standing up for what he believes – breaking German codes and winning the war, even if that means sacrificing some people's lives. With a tightly knit script, the movie touches on three time zones – when Turing studies at a boarding school, when he works at the Bletchley Radio Factory and after the war when he teaches at university. The three periods are seamlessly intertwined and flows beautifully to highlight certain aspects of Turing which last/haunt all his life and make him unique. In a nutshell, he is a complicated person and we as audience also feel a mixture of feelings while watching his endeavor, whether professionally or personally. One easily feel really sorry and despaired, but at the same time inspired and encouraged.Benedict Cumberbatch is superb in portraying different levels of complexity in Turing's character. While others consider him arrogant and eccentric, we also see him as a single-minded, focused and smart person who just wants to break the codes and end the war. Although others consider him weird, it is exactly this quality that helps him build the decoding machine and save millions of lives by cutting the war short. Throughout the movie, there is a strong sense of suffering endured by Turing since he was a child, despite his genius in various aspects. It becomes more complicated when his sexual orientation causes him more threat. To makes his life even more intrigue, he is involved in decoding war secrets where no traces are allowed after the war. All these mysterious elements makes the film fascinating to watch. The support cast and sound track, as well as art direction, are excellent in depicting this unusual person in this extraordinary time. Alex Lawther, who plays young Turing, is magnificent with his limited screen time. His timid, sweet and shy smile, appreciative blinks as well as sad, repressed and determined denials make one's heart break. However, Keira Knightley is perhaps too attractive to playing Joan Clark, another mathematics expert who also feels like an outsider. History is ironic in a sense that we have to depend on someone abnormal to bring our lives back to normal. And yet society in general, at least back then, does not tolerant people who are seemingly different from the majority and tries to convert the outliers. However, determined, patient and focused, Turing has tremendous confidence in himself which others easily consider as narcissistic and egoistic. Perhaps one needs to do that as defense when one is so different. He probably did not realize his contribution to England as well as mankind when he was absorbed in his work. All he did was work hard in his own territory. Coincidentally Mencius the ancient Chinese philosopher says that 'If I believe in what I am doing, I will go ahead even if tens of thousands of people are against me.' I can see that in Turing. Although some people even consider Turing as a machine, judging from his deep affection for his childhood friend we can hardly call him a machine. From the real Mathematics prodigy Alan Turing to the award-winning screenwriter Graham Moore and Benedict Cumberbatch who acted out the character, we are blatantly told that it is OK to be weird and be different. All we need is to realize our potential and make good use of it. Someday, somehow, our efforts will be recognized. Perhaps if we keep it in mind, life is not that bad. Very inspirational and make you think outside the box. May we all be more open-minded coming out of this film.",9,3,9,2 March 2015
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Rich experience for movie watching - Must see (SPOILER WARNING)
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is the best movie I have seen in recent years: thought provoking, visually pleasing, emotionally moving and soothing. It has exercised the full potential of movie making.SPOILER WARNING!!!! In a way similar to Momento (2000) and 21 Grams (2003), I was trying to figure out the time sequence as the movies ran. Except this time it is the couple's relationship in Joel's nightmarish erasure. Contrary to the other two purely rational analyses, this one urged me to feel sorry for Joel.The imaginative flow of Joel's memory mixed up with the interference of the procedure is like a stream of consciousness filled with predicament. It is visually pleasing and free. Initially I was trying to think, then I just feel, let it happen and 'enjoyed it.' It felt great!The earlier his memory dates back, the more I felt sorry for this guy who had been neglected since he was young. In a way he was saved/dragged out of his grimness by the extrovert Clem, despite his misunderstanding of her flirting around and their inability in carrying out intellectual conversations.Jim Carrey's performance is so great that I can't stopped myself from weeping when he murmured with such sadness, 'I wish I had stayed. I wish I had stayed' as the water washed away the sand in the beach house. Things are over no matter how much you regret and feel sad about it. Yet on the other hand, you never know what might happen once you admit your emotion.Both Joel and Clem are not particularly lovable characters in the movie as in some Hollywood comedies, but it is this quality that makes the movie so close to real life - that many love affairs are unexplainable yet memorable and that's what keep us going.Apart from the sequence, the movie also forces you to ponder what is involved in a relationship. One thing always come up in breakups is misunderstanding caused by miscommunication. This is clearly revealed in the couple's listening to each other's tapes. I have a feeling that after this ordeal, they will know each other better and their relationship will be fortified.Another strong message is the predominance of fate/destiny, a theme comparable with Sliding Doors (1998). Even after her memory of Joel is erased, Clem is still the extrovert girl who goes up to Joel and starts a relationship; Mary is still the little fan who falls in love with the professional. So what is the point of erasing our memory? Just forget the past and/but relive it again? If our mind is spotless, will there be eternal sunshine?One of the values of memory is that we can build on it and learn from it. If we lose it and commit the same mistakes again it will be tragic. Mary's action hit a positive note on the whole notion and glues Joel and Clem back together, making them feel better about each other. We do have spots in our mind and we have to learn to live with it. Perhaps that's why the film is set in gloomy weather and even the ending is set in dimly lit, maze-like indoors. Such is life!Budding in Being John Malkovich (1999) and growing in Adaptation (2002), Charlie Kaufman has blossomed in this one in terms of exploring the human mind. I am looking forward to seeing this movie again and again. Visually, intellectually and emotionally overwhelming and pleasing. Witty plot, great script, excellent acting, awesome visual effects and warming to the heart at the end. A must see.",10,0,1,15 May 2004
3 Idiots," A wise person may look like an idiot: Chinese proverb
","I missed it during the 2010 Hong Kong International Film Festival and am really glad it is released publicly.Haven't seen such a feel good movie for a long time. Excellent and inspiring plot with very positive messages and many hilarious scenes.Inspiring messages and witty lines are dotted throughout the movie, intertwined with some teary scenes: all is well if you follow your passion; chase excellence and success will follow; be brave and follow your dream; think outside the box and be flexible.It challenges our current values on education and success – that we should learn for the sake of learning but not for grades or what others want us to do. What's the point if you memorize everything but do not understand what it means and do not know how to put what you have learned into application? What an inspiring movie. It challenges your comfort thinking mode and urge you to be yourself and chase your dream/passion.Excellent acting, colorful and typical Bollywood musical scenes with uplifting songs and dance moves, not to mention the soothing natural scenery interspersed in the moving episodes of friendship, love, family and playful/stressful campus life.Every student, teacher, and parent or anyone who cares about our future should see it. What kind of world do we want to live in? What kind of person do we want our next generation to be? What kind of lives do we want to lead? This movie makes us ponder on these.Somehow the movie echoed Steve Job's quotes : 'Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people's thinking.' 'Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.' Both Steve and the Rancho character (Aamir Khan) are smart and creative, nice and helpful to friends and people who are willing to learn. They are true to their feelings. They dare to challenge authority and encourages others to do the same. We need more people like these in this world.Just go see it. You won't regret it.",9,29,47,2 September 2011
Some Like It Hot," A classic comedy that excels on all fronts
","I went to see this because of Marilyn Monroe. Of course I was not disappointed. She is not as dumb as she describes herself is. And she sings well too. But it was Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis who make this comedy alive. You can sense the sparkles between them even when they first appear in the show in Chicago. Then, when they pose as women it was so amusing and pleasant! Yet their performance would not have been so engaging if not for the witty lines and intriguing plot. There is literally not a dull moment throughout the whole movie. The plot develops very well and the pacing was just right. Although the Osgood Fielding III character (Joe Brown) seems to be annoying in the beginning, he turns out to be instrumental in later part of the story and the heartily conversation in perfect tempo between him and Lemmon on the speed boat is so memorable.Some Like it Hot is perfect in all sense: acting, script, direction, costume (Oh how Monroe's dresses keep me gazing), music. It is such a classic that we will probably never have anything like this for a long, long time.",9,3,3,1 September 2012
Les Misérables," A perfect combination of musical and movie
","I have never cried so much in a movie yet I felt great crying, weeping or blinking away tears watching this movie. There was this strong sense of community with human compassion when I heard people around me searching for tissue papers or wiping tears or sobbing. It is alright to cry in a movie and I felt comfortable crying with them. It was also great I chose a late show so that I could go home right afterwards without walking around with red eyes.I have never read Hugo's original but that did not prevent me from appreciating the story and admiring his confidence in and love for humankind. I have seen the musical years ago but this movie made that production bland and unimpressive. Tom Hooper has demonstrated a perfect combination of musical and movie and made this epic a masterpiece. I can watch it and listen to the songs over and over and never get tired of it.It is a tragic story and we cried but we felt great watching it because out of this intriguing chaos there is something noble about the human race which gives us hope and keeps us going. The story itself is simple yet so rich that it inspires you to think what is important – survival, forgiveness, salvation, compassion, help, trust, love, justice, morality, revolution, sacrifice, fairness, liberty, hope, and death. Yet, without the songs and music, these themes could not have been explored and yet leave you enough room to ponder, absorb and be moved. With the live singing and close-up of intense emotions, the production easily moves you into tears and laughter. The singing was simply beautiful. I was not sure if it was their heavenly voice, or their emotions, the music, or the situations in the story that moved me. I cried when Fantine (Anne Hathaway) sang about her lost dream, when little Cosette (Isabelle Allen) sang of her castle in the cloud, when Eponine (Samantha Barks) sang of her loneliness and love in her mind, when Marius (Eddie Redmayne) sang of his lost friends and of course in the last scene. Hugh Jackman is unbelievable. I almost did not recognize him when he appeared in the workshop. Then again when Cosette grew up he seemed transformed into another person. Yet throughout the movie, the determination in his eyes was powerful and unforgettable. Anne sang beautifully and she just swept the audience away at every frame she appeared and every note she sang. It was such a pity that her appearance was so brief. When little Cosette first appeared, I felt OMG, she is exactly like the sad girl in the poster! The sadness in her eyes made your heart ache. Then she sang and it sounded like an angel! Yet you could also feel her longing and hoping for a perfect world. All the cast were great. In comparison, Russell Crowe seemed to be less impressive although he did well. Even when there was no character struggle, the singing and visuals were simply entertaining. You will not notice time has passed as it is simply captivating. I am now looking for the sound track and DVD. Just hope HMV does not close down so soon.",9,4,7,16 January 2013
12 Years a Slave," A Painful History to Come to Terms with
","Congratulations to 12 Years a Slave on winning the Oscar Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress in the Oscar. The movie is based on a tragic true story of Solomon Northup, a free man who was kidnapped and enslaved in the deep south of America before the Civil War. While we rejoice at the achievement of this production, we should not forget the agony millions of slaves suffered while building America.This is a very difficult and disturbing movie to watch because of the slow tempo depicting the heavy and ugly reality that actually happened more than a century ago. All the torture, helplessness, abuse, and betrayal caused a minor headache. The last movie I felt so upset but had to finish watching was Schindler's List. There were so many moments that I wanted to just leave the theater.But I also want to stay and see what happened. I know Northup's (Chiwetel Ejiofor) ordeal would end and I want to find out how he sticks it out and return to freedom. The film opens with his determination to reach out to the outside world – by boiling fruit juice to make ink to write on a precious piece of paper. But it is not until the latter half of the movie that this scene reappears. By then he has almost spent 12 years as a slave in a plantation under a mad couple who routinely abused their slaves.Solomon Northup's misfortune started in 1841 when the talented violinist was invited to perform at a circus in Washington DC. He drank with his acquaintance and got really drunk. But the time he woke up, he was chained up and locked in a cell where the Capitol was seen. He and other black people were herded on a boat, shipped along the Red River to the south, stripped and sold like a cattle. Throughout the film, we witness how threatening life can be to a slave, whether they work in the sugar cane field or cotton field. It is no Gone with the Wind, and definitely not Unchained Django. As meticulous described in Solomon Northup's memoir, slaves work day in and day out without knowing what will happen to them in the next minute: they can be physically or sexually abused or be sold to other monstrous plantation owners anytime. They are treated as property which can be freely sold. It seems to be a massive psychotic society where slaves were not respected at all. Being illiterate and without knowledge of the outside world, many just put their head down to survive. Some, like our heroine Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o who won the Best Supporting Actress for this role), do not even want to survive but also lack the courage to end their own life. Yet in this hopeless and helpless situation, Solomon does not only want to survive, 'I want to live.' He exhibits enormous determination to leave this situation and return to his family in the north. He never loses hope despite failures and threats around him. He fights back. He attempts to escape. He asks a white slave for help only to find out he is betrayed: he tries all he can to return to freedom.Since Solomon is literate, he can articulate and record his mundane and tortured life on the plantation after he regains his freedom. Think of all the other unheard and unrecorded horror stories. Award winning script writer John Ridley based his script, many lines verbatim, on Northup's memoir. Armed with this capturing script by John Ridley, director Steve McQueen gathers an excellent ensemble of cast to relive this unflattering history and forces us to reflect on what we have done to our fellow human beings and how noble some people are despite the cruel circumstances. The sound effects, or the lack of it, is haunting as we witness the slaves' hardship: when Solomon was hanged on a tree, tiptoeing the mud right beneath him under the boiling sun; when Patsey was whipped by Northup, we only hear the whip wheezing and her screaming. According to Northup's memoir, when his master Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) took over the whip, he hit 10 times harder than Northup himself. That prolonged scene is tormenting to watch and provoke you to wonder how can a person do this to another. She, a hardworking woman who yields more cotton than the men, is already abused sexually in addition to being the source of jealousy from Mistress Epps (Sarah Epps). This abuse of power reminds me of the Stanford Prison Experiment initiated by Dr Philip Zimbardo in the 1970s. Once university students were assigned a powerful role they did horrible things to the prisoners. That experiment was aborted after only six days but slavery went on for decades in the US. Although the Declaration of Independence was adopted in 1776 which states that 'All men are created equal,' there were slave trade in even the capital! America is such a hypocrite society. It is sad that Solomon's persecution against his abductors did not materialize and his last days were unknown. African Americans has come a long way, from slaves to the civil war to Rosa Parks. They built America but their effort was not commemorated and it was not until Martin Luther King then they are more equal and finally there is Barack Obama. This movie would mean so much to the American society. Very serious and very heavy but so brutally real. More stories like this should be told. Not just the glamorous Gone with the Wind, heroic Django Unchained, and the entertaining Butler. It is high time we face our past. For without know the past, we would never understand how and where we would go forward. A must watch for those who care for humanity.",9,6,10,3 March 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Totally entertaining, full of testosterone and black humor
","While Michael Douglas gave an award-winning performance of ruthless Gordon Gekko who is still haunting after all these decades, Leonardo DeCaprio shows his best performance to date of a hyperactive, egoistic yet charismatic broker who is willing to do anything to get rich on Wall Street.I bet Leonardo will snatch the Oscar for his role here. Never would I have imagined he would play such a character when I watched the Titanic years ago. Even though DeCaprio has played a versatile of roles, I would never have imagined he could be someone like this: so abusive, arrogant, decadent, greedy, and yet confident of himself. He is just as capturing as his sales skills are in the movie. In addition to this, his role indulges himself in drugs, women and getting rich – by any means. All these qualities do not sound very appealing but when you put these onto DeCaprio, he suddenly becomes a capturing character.The scary part is that all these drama are based on a true story – of Jordan Belfort who helps writing the script and even stars in this movie – after he was convicted of Federal crimes in defrauding investors and served terms in jail.It could be ugly with all these crimes and abuses but the way director Martin Scorsese and script writer Terence Winter handle it is full of black humor and you cannot help laughing and wondering in awe while learning these bitter lessons. DeCaprio literally shines in several classic scenes – one in selling penny stocks to some innocent working class John Doe on the phone (played by director Martin Scorsese himself); another in slurring speeches and crawling into his race car after an overdose of an expired drug; another in giving motivational speeches and pushing a captive audience to sell; or talking suggestively and condescendingly to FBI agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) on a yacht during an investigation. When the movie first started, DeCaprio is like an innocent boy next door. But after closes his first sale and is taken to lunch by his supervisor Mark Hana (Matthew McConaughey), his testosterone gradually increases. When they are humming and pounding their chests in that Manhattan restaurant, I really feel I see two primates. Soon, we witness his gradual evolution into a wolf.This movie is full of testosterone. Very aggressive, rough, ruthless, and corrupted even when it is portraying women. But at the same time it is fun and hilarious when you see how self-destructive, crazy and soulless these people are, in the name of making money. The duration is over three hours but it is so engaging that it does not feel that long. What an intense life Jordan Belfort has. He, and as DeCaprio portrays, is a hyperactive, dominant, ruthless, indulging smart-ass with an extremely sweet tongue. And he never quits! He even betrays his friends and colleagues to protect his own butt. Probably not very dependable and not likable with such a horrid lifestyle. But the reality is, he wrote about his dramatic ups and downs in a book which this movie is based on and is now giving speeches around the world after he is discharged from prison. This movie cannot be so successful without an excellent supporting cast who can otherwise very well be top comedians. Jonah Hill gives a liberating performance from Moneyball. He elevates himself here as Donnie Azoff, Belfort's second in command, someone Belfort trusts but is actually smarter than he looks. Jean Dujardin plays the role of a cunning Swiss banker Jean Jacques Saurel who has tons of tricks to launder Belfort's money. His facial expressions and heavy accent pushes the comical elements to the highest level. Beautiful second wife Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) demonstrates that a pretty and sexy woman can also act and shows a variety of emotions.The monologues during meetings/encounters are excellent in depicting the hilarious hypocrisy of these scumbags. I guarantee you would laugh and nod at the same time. Lots of nudity, graphic sex scenes and drug taking shots. Yet they are all relevant so keep young children away. This is entertaining and relieving to watch because you would laugh, enjoy the carefree lifestyle without having to bear the consequences. Who knows, maybe along the way you will pick up some skills in sweet talking/persuasive speaking too. Highly recommended.",8,0,2,17 February 2014
Fifty Shades of Grey," When hot rich dominant guy meets innocent college grad desperate for love: story of abused love
","Fifty Shades of Grey is quite a disappointment, although the book is not that good to start with. Dakota Johnson who plays Ana, the innocent college graduate who is desperate for love but has been waiting for the right person, is pretty and acts alright. But Jamie Dornan who plays the filthy rich young CEO Christian Grey is quite a disaster. Yet I think it is the plot (if there is any), the script, and the direction that kills it. To start with, the plot was weak, as in the novel. But at least in the book there is some suspense which attracts you to find out what kind of person Grey is and how his haunted past has turned him into such a mysterious and strange person today. This suspense is fascinating as many women like to play the role of martyr/curer so as to 'save' the man they think they love, even if it means sacrificing themselves. So it is rewarding seeing Grey changes his behavior patterns (eg not do the girlfriend thing, not sleep with women etc) because of Ana who probably wants to be his last woman. This in itself is a conquering feeling that would keep the audience/reader enticed.In a way, it is almost like a modern fairy tale – Cinderella is picked up by the pumpkin-turned horse carriage and Ana is swept off the feet by all those new electronic gadgets, a brand new car, and a helicopter and a glider ride by the man she feels intrigued with, not to mention Grey always appears like a white knight who saves her from all kinds of embarrassment. What's more, it is the abundance, spontaneous, various, intense and sometimes kinky sex that sustain the fascination in the book. Unfortunately they are drastically left out in the movie, hence making it less interesting to watch. Perhaps the hot sex would be difficult to show in pure graphic language. But better direction would have led the audience to imagine without laying everything out like an XXX rated movie  Even Grey's wealth and taste is lamely portrayed. His supposedly luxurious apartment looks drab and bland. With the empty and heartless dialogues, it feels like a trashy afternoon TV drama with a weak plot, slow pace and non-arousing love scenes only bored and overweight housewives would watch. And all these is even before mentioning the negative criticism on domestic violence the film receives. Mind you though, Ana wants to know more about Christian and help him. That's why she is willing to step into this uncertainty, even it means letting herself be hurt. But perhaps a sensible woman would leave at such point and only a fictional character would exercise such involvement. Thus as reader and audience, we would feel safe while vicariously entering such risky relationships. The book itself, despite its mounting sales, is of limited literal achievement. However, I must admit it serves like a manual where it is tempting to try out some new functions. But other than that, the plot, character development, and theme are quite weak. Unfortunately the movie is worse. I would not recommend watching it with your date. In fact, you probably would not miss much not watching it. Briefly scan the book instead, there might be some practical tips you can pick up.",3,28,55,13 February 2015
Saving Mr. Banks," A Healing Extension of Writing Therapy
","I am always fascinated by really life stories. Saving Mr Banks is more than what I expected: it skilfully meshes a few stories together on the same theme â€“ fatherly love to his children x 3; the power of imagination x 3; go after your dream x 2.The main story line is how Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) and his team work with British writer P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to put her popular children's book Mary Poppins onto the silver screen. Disney, as a promise to his daughter, has been negotiating with P.L. Travers for over 20 years for her approval. Travers has not been willing to give it away but softened because she is financially challenged. So naturally she wants to have final say in writing the script.While Saving Mr Banks is pleasant, enjoyable and entertaining, there is a certain kind of heaviness which keeps me intrigued until the deal is finally settled. I like this movie very much because it is so rich and so nicely crafted. I can see the whole production pays a lot of respect to the writer and those who do creative work. To work with artists, we really need a lot of patience. To pave the background of how Travers has evolved into today's state, we see seamless flashbacks of Travers in Australia when she was a little girl and how her father (Colin Farrell) encouraged her to dream and travel in her world of fantasy. A frustrated bank manager, Travers' father had his own problems which Travers tried but was unable to solve. Perhaps this helplessness has turned into her hang-ups thereafter. Along the line we see excerpts of Mary Poppins, both in text and rehearsals, which also intertwines with Travers' memory of her father and the final Disney movie.Very rich content with detailed depiction of the main characters and their emotions. Excellent direction and storytelling skills by images. Even though there are three of four stories lines, I am fully engaged and never feel confused. I enjoy looking at what is happening while wondering how the past affect the present and future. The artistic direction is great as it threw in lots of cues to link the different stories so it is also like watching a detective story. Emma Thompson plays perfectly the role of a rigid, frigid, cold, tensed and vulnerable PL Travers. Although we constantly see the flashbacks and how her past haunts her present, there still is a lack of connection on how the lovely and imaginative girl would evolve into such an distrusting, demanding and difficult person. Tom Hanks is moving when he is seen flying personally to London (even though it did not happen in real life) to track Travers down and unlock her hang-ups with the past by exposing/sharing his own unflattering past in earnest sincerity, teary-eyed. Both characters have a difficult childhood. Both bring happiness to millions of kids after they grow up, perhaps as a kind of compensation and healing? But then why did one develop into an optimist and the other a nagger who became so harsh on herself and everyone around her? This is perhaps an issue we need to ponder. It is a great piece for parents/teachers/adults to watch because we might never realize how even a tiny gesture/word of ours could have immense affect (constructively or destructively) on our children/next generation. Quite a rich movie to munch on and gives you more hope on humanity.Very meticulous research done. I particularly enjoy the end of credits where the actual tapes of PL Travers are played and we can really feel her nitpicking. Emma Thomson nailed it right there! Also running along the credits are archive pictures of the real PL Travers and Walt Disney. Valuable history.Cannot wait to see Mary Poppins which I have not seen before. Knowing the background of the author, it probably helps to appreciate this award-winning picture that snatched five Oscars in 1965 after going through a lot of hardship to be put on the big screen. After all, it represents an extension of a girls' love for her beloved father and she has been healing herself by writing, something her father had always encouraged her to do.",8,0,1,21 February 2014
Her," A Prophecy on How Technology Could Pathetically Numb Our Feelings
","Her is another tragedy describing how technology alienates rather than connects us. With creativity, vision and insight, it depicts a pathetic and depressing society. With strong contrasts, it previews and predicts a heartless future unless we wake up. Congratulations on the Oscar Best Original Screenplay.The basic story line is set in the near future where our protagonist Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) works in a company that helps clients write personal letters to their loved ones. After working solitarily at his work station, Theodore goes home to his huge apartment, playing computer games with a virtual little man or having virtual sex with someone he has never met. He is divorced because he had difficulty telling his feelings. He meets someone new and they hit it off well but he seems to have intimacy issues.Longing for something new in his life, he bought an intelligent operating system, Samantha, (Scarlet Johansson) which has learning abilities. Theodore communicates with Samantha daily and developed a romantic relationship with her. Theodore does not have lots of friends. Amy (Amy Adams) is a neighbor and colleague. After breaking up with her boyfriend Charles (Matt Letscher), Amy also brought a smart operating system whom she treats as a close friend. While the futuristic setting is very interesting and the overall tone of the film is quite warm and bright in pastel color, I feel a haunting coldness and profound sadness. Not that I am an advocate on appearance, but the characters do not seem to care how they look. The beautiful Amy Adams appears with messy hair and almost no makeup. The cute guy in the poster wears an odd-looking thick rimmed glasses with a dense moustache which makes him so much less attractive. But it probably symbolizes an era where we only communicate through electronic devices so we do not need to care our appearance. Theodore's glasses and moustache are also perfect masks for his feelings. However, to me it is quite a turnoff. It seems in that world everything is focused on the intangible and virtual – like the relationship with an OS.As for the strong contrasts: all the indoor shots are with closed windows. Although Theodore's apartment is spacious and organized, I feel kind of stuffy and lonely. As they go up the apartment, there are shadows of trees on the wall next to the elevator. Things in that world seems very unnatural.Outside on the beach, on the street or in the subway, people are all isolated, or talking to an electronic device. Despite the bright sunshine, people are all absorbed in their own world without connecting to others. Throughout the whole movie the color tone is warm and pastel. But even with the sunshine, the feelings are cold and distant, stuffy and detached. It is just like the technology which is supposed to bring us together but we end up drowning in it and ignoring the people in front of us. Perhaps even in that virtual world people are not connected because they can choose not to respond, or alter their responses. They do not have to listen yet expect others to listen. With an OS it is even worse because they will adapt to your style and say what you want to hear. No wonder relationships fail in the movie - Theodore and Catherine, Amy and Charles, Theo's date and her past men. Even the OS relationships did not make it. They fail because people have refused to listen and compromise. Sad. The director paints a vivid picture of a world where people only care about themselves. They only want their own voice to be heard. I feel tremendously sad about the whole situation because the character are so timid to limit themselves and afraid to take risks. They do not try to put themselves into others' shoes, let alone sharing their feelings. This is even more ironical considering Theo is a writer who helps others voice their feelings. Perhaps even those feelings are fake and he has never gone inside himself to get in touch with his own feelings, not to mention expressing them. The sad part is this type of self-centered disconnection is gradually spreading around us with the proliferation of smart phones, super computers and artificial intelligence. Although it has been said that love can go beyond the physical aspect and more about spiritual and emotional sharing, without physical touch and human warmth, love is never complete. A hug is so much more soothing – especially when words often got easily misinterpreted. Sometimes the important thing is better left unsaid. Sometimes the more we speak, the more misunderstanding we have. But the body does not lie. Thus it is scary and weird when the human body is controlled by an OS. Her depicts an absurd world where we do not express our feelings anymore and need help from the expert letter writers like Theodore. Ironically these experts cannot connect with other human beings either even though they can write touching letters. There is some revelation in the final scene when they finally find fresh air and see hope with the sunrise after a long and dark night. And hey, Amy is leaning on Theodore. For extensive watching, you may find TED Talk: Connect but Alone by Sherry Turkles relevant to this theme.",8,1,2,9 April 2014
