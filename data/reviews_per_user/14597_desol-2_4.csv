Vertigo," What Happened Hitch ?
","First I thought I'd list my top 10 Hitchcock films 1) Under Capricorn 2) Notorious 3) Rear Window 4) I, Confess 5) North By Northwest 6) Frenzy 7) The Lady Vanishes 8) Rope 9) The 39 Steps 10) Spellbound I consider myself a big Hitchcock fan I've got over 35 of Hitchcocks films and for me Vertigo is near the bottom I've never understood why this film is hyped up, Stewart puts in a poor performance, for him, so he's still pretty good but Kim Novak is abysmal.  The story has massive plot holes and is incredibly slow I can usually watch slow paced talkies as I've pointed out above I think Under Capricorn is his best film and that's slow and talkie but Capricorn is always interesting and has the fantastic Ingrid Bergman with Joseph Cotton.  For me after Rear Window Hitchcock lost the plot a bit and often his films started to drag with Vertigo and the Birds being the worst offenders.  The only films he made after Rear Window that are worthy of his great name are North by Northwest, Psycho (well the first hour) and Frenzy.  I wish I loved this film, I thought I would, but I've seen it 3 times now and still think it's a bit of a dog.  3/10",3,16,34,13 March 2001
Casablanca," Good but not that good
","Casablanca is one of those films who's hype blinds people from giving their real opinion on it, because if you don't say it's one of the greatest then you can't be taken seriously.  I'll admit that I think it's a very good film with some very good performances and the romantic chemistry created by Bergman and Bogart is awesome, but being a massive Bergman Fan I've so far got 20 of her films and I wouldn't include Casablanca in her top 10. (Casablanca is in my opinion not as good as Gaslight, Notorious, Arch of Triumph, Under Capricorn, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, Goodbye Again, Indiscreet, Joan of Arc, Voyage to Italy, Cactus Flower, Anastasia).  There are some great moments like when Bergman tells Sam `play it, Sam' then Bogart walks in.  The Paris flash back. The Le Marseillaise bit and of course the ending.  Bad acting by some of the support actors is the only real downer. Out of 10 I'd give it 8.",8,2,6,20 September 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Best film of 2000 by a long, long way.
","Wow, the Crouching Tiger backlash has well and truly begun, I can't believe some of the stuff I've read knocking this film.  People who knock this film because there are people flying just haven't got a clue this film is not a historical epic, it's a fantasy film set in mythical China.  And fantasy doesn't mean childish who said that adults have to only like realism films and anyway the relationships between the characters in this film is as real as any film out there.  And just as bad as the `what people don't fly, this is rubbish' crew are the `I've seen loads of better Martial Arts films then this' brigade.  Maybe you have but this wasn't loved because the great fighting alone it was loved for the whole package the fact that character and plot had as much if not more importance then the fighting, that's what was revolutionary (but I doubt it was the first).  But the fact that the film was a huge hit should be admired by the Martial Arts snobs because maybe it will influence a lot of those films to have more plot which would make the whole genre much better.  I only watched CTHD because someone told me it was good and I had heard all the critics praise and to be honest I thought I was going to see an okay film.  But after seeing it I was blown away, not by the action great as it is, but by the characters and plot. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh are wonderful but the real star is Zhang Ziyi who is fantastic as the troubled Jen.  The ending is really terrific and emotional and probably my favourite part of the film.   And for me the two best fight sequences are the first Jade Fox fight (I love the way Chow Yun Fat smirks when he easily knocks her down), and the second is when Jen takes on all the fighters in the tavern.  I wasn't expecting a great film because I never believe in Hype but this film for me is one of the only films in history that deserved every bit of praise it got, but of course it's not going to be for everyone.  So those that like adventure and romance just open your mind to the mythical China setting lay back and watch one of the greatest films of all-time. 10/10",10,1,2,15 July 2001
The Sixth Sense," Pretty good
","The Sixth Sense is a good film but the twist is pretty obvious, and the pace of the film is incredibly slow.  But what made the film worth watching are the top performances from Bruce Willis and Toni Collette, I also thought the Osement kid was good, but his performance was hyped up. He was no better then the child from 'Mercury rising' in fact in my opinion he was not as good as that kid.  I gave this film 8/10.",8,0,0,11 May 2000
