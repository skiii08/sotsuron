Skyfall," The Best Bond Yet!!!
","Although this movie came out so recently, I have to say that THIS MOVIE IS BY FAR THE BEST BOND FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN. And I've seen almost all of them. When I first saw Daniel Craig as Bond, I honestly didn't like him. That's not because I hated him as an actor, but the story was just all kinds of bad for me. All he did in Casino Royale was play poker, and he didn't have the suaveness of the other Bonds. I understand that's how it was supposed to be because it was a reboot and an origin story, but it wasn't my cup of tea. I saw Quantum of Solace, but I don't really remember it, so it must not have been important. But this movie combined all of the things that made Bond such a great series. It combined the old school with the new. It had all of that nostalgic stuff I was used to, plus a darker more realistic tone, and I love it for doing that. Javier Bardem was essentially the Joker of the Bond universe. He's a great actor and this is one of his best performances. This movie is like The Dark Knight of the Bond series.

Whiplash," Very Good Acting and Energy, but ridiculously misplaced
","Before I start, I'd like to say I am a musician and I do appreciate jazz. That being said, I do like the music in this film. But that's about the only thing I did like.The story is very original, but ridiculously unrealistic and far-fetched. Honestly, if a college professor verbally, and even more importantly, PHYSICALLY abused students, they would be fired at the snap of a finger. Tenured or not, their career would be over.The acting is extremely good. J.K. Simmons did a very good job. But the energy was badly misplaced. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a JAZZ TEACHER AND CONDUCTOR! NOT A MARINE DRILL SERGEANT! There is no need for that amount of intensity, no matter how prestigious the school may be.And honestly, who would break up with a great, beautiful girl to focus on trying to impress an abusive teacher? I wouldn't. It's just dumb.My biggest problem with this film is the car crash scene. He got t-boned by an 18 wheeler and overturned. He should have been concussed and bones should have been broken. Instead, he's fine and decides to go perform. Stupid.At the end, Neimann is kicked out of school and Fletcher is out of a job, but for some reason, even with all that bad blood, they decided to get together and perform, which was just a setup by Fletcher to humiliate and embarrass Neimann. Highly unlikely. But then he kicks ass on drums and impresses Fletcher? That's stupid, too! IT VALIDATES ALL OF THE ABUSE FLETCHER PERPETRATED IN THE FIRST PLACE! It just ends with such a horrible message.It's a good film, just not my taste. Well acted, but everything about it's intensity is badly misplaced.",4,5,10,17 February 2015
