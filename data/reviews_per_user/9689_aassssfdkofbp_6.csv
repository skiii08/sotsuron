Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Marvel what if history edition
","Flat out stupid fun with ludicrous action scenes played serious. The fact this ain't a spoof movie makes it way better its got a certain charm to it that I really enjoy the spewy blood effects, the crazy spin attacks, and the president himself killing vampires It's great.",7,1,1,7 April 2020
Life of Pi," Pretentious god garbage
",It looks amazing but I'm not gonna waste my breath on this movie. It's overbearing religion garbage that they force down your throat every scene plus it's slow to. Avoid this propaganda trying to brainwash you I wanted the real story not this r******* fake version of it,1,0,4,28 April 2020
The Thing," I've been missing out on this forever
",What is there to say about this movie that hasn't been said nothing really. This is a masterpiece obviously with the BEST practical effects out there and the movie got brains with a assimilating alien that attempts to wipe out a American base but fails to realize Kurt Russell is also at the base who takes full control of the situation but no one knows whose infected or whose not so everyone is suspicious of each other. Just go watch this masterpiece,10,1,1,22 April 2020
Bridesmaids," Not a single laugh....
",I sat there stone faced waiting for something funny but it never happened but apparently people love this.. well these people must have been drunk good characters my a** we got a whiney blond girl who should have been going to therapy with her womanisms freaking out randomly. She meets a really nice guys and they do really good together then after a steamy night back at home she gets up he asks her if she wants to bake with him she's like 'no' she keeps denying 20 seconds he asks why it's bothering her so bad she yells well you don't even know me. He says yes I don't cause you won't open up to me then she's run away like WTF women logic. The rest of the characters 'joke' the whole time. Ignore the other reviews this is garbage.,1,0,3,10 April 2020
Transformers," I feel dirty after watching this
",Horrible writing god awful dialogue unfunny jokes and plot holes galore Plus I couldn't even tell what was happening when the robots fought it was just a big ball of cgi. It was painful watching this I couldn't even enjoy looking at the main girl (Megan fox) she's very unattractive with her anorexic body and caked on makeup. Imma pull a quote that pin points how I feel about this movie. 'Abandon all hope ye who enter here',1,1,5,9 April 2020
Don't Breathe," ' it's kind of messed up to rob a blind guy isn't it'
","Yes it really is and we are supposed to root for these spineless cowards who rob a blind man and then the blind man defends himself they deserved it. Also the blind man must have super powers cause blind people aren't able to do the things this guy does. Plus they had so many chances to kill the blind man realistically even though he's a veteran it would be very easy to kill him but these three morons sneak around the entire time. Crying tripping on crap and making noise constantly. Awful shoehorned in plot trying to be disturbing but it comes off as 'we can't come up with a good story so let's just make the man try to inseminate the hypocritical garbage blond girl with a turkey baster' it try's way to hard , a pitiful 'villain', nothing is even slightly scary, the whole movie I was rooting for these idiots to die, and very unlikable characters especially the greedy hypocritical girl character who I wanted to get tortured who sacrifices her friends just to get the money but no she lives of course",1,1,1,9 April 2020
