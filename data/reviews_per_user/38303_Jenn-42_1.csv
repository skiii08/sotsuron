The Blair Witch Project," No music! Great idea!
","At first, without any prior information on the film, I thought the story was true.  A friend & I went to see it & we could barely stay throughout the entire movie.  I loved the fact that there wasn't any type of scary music to fore shadow.  How the different camera angles, really made this almost surreal.  I haven't had an adrenaline rush like this in the longest time.  2 thumbs up for me!!! :)",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
