The Avengers," About Time Marvel
","I've always loved Marvel films ever since the original Spider man back in 2002 Marvel to me was so much better then DC. Spider man was my favorite superhero and i thought he was awesome and couldn't be beat. But then Iron Man showed up 6 years later and at the end i found out it was just a thread for an Avengers film. Then with some other films in order we the fans have finally gotten what we deserve and that is the crown jewel called THE AVENGERS. This film defiantly deserves the award for most anticipated summer film, best superhero film and so on. If there is one flaw i had to give this film its that this film has an ending to it. Me I could watch Iron Man Thor Hulk etc fight evil a million times over and it would never get old because Stan the man Lee has created something special with each character in Marvel and those qualities have finally come out in this film",10,16,33,18 April 2012
Iron Man 3," Finally A Good Third Movie
",Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man is irreplaceable like Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and once again Robert/Tony Stark shows off why we love him so much in these movies.Iron Man 3 is one of those hard to create movies when it comes to making a perfect trilogy but Shane Black managed to pull it off quite well i believe. The personalities he puts into his characters coupled with a heck of a lot of action is just top notch in my book.And Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin was something I have been waiting for in an Iron Man film and he does deliver a presence that dare I say is a successor to Heath Ledgers Joker,9,32,71,24 April 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Worth Seeing NOT Worth Praising
",The Amazing Spider man could be treated as a glass half full/empty depending on which side of the fence you are on. Compared to Sam Raimi i think that this film does not measure up at all. TAS i agree with most critics saying that it was too soon to make a reboot since its only 5 years after spider man 3. While this movie may have some nice elements to boot it is in a way not Amazing like the 1st film. This one lacks any decent action or romance i feel like Marc Webb didn't really put any effort into this film or at least not enough. I have little complaints of the actors but some complaints against the characters they play. Andrew did a tolerable job as the webhead but he was more rebellious then a nerd which peter parker is NOT. Emma was the same as Gwen but she lacked any innocence gwen has in the comics. Making her a science intern made her look occupied instead of loving. Rhys was great as Connors but the lizard i felt like was too much off character. Lizard's plan while relatively the same as in most comics did not live up to doc ock and 'maybe' the grren goblin but was better then sandy or venom. In short this film i feel like should not have been made. I see this film as a knockoff to a great spiderman film when compared to raimi,5,16,59,21 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," The X-Men go to the X-TREME
",Some movies tend to leave important parts out and that causes the fans to wonder if a sequel if any will tie up all loose ends.Well this prequel to the world renowned xmen franchise ties up pretty much everything there was to know although some things still go unexplained but I'm sure that First Class isn't the last X-Men film to be made. There are tons of stories to be told and this was just the beginning. Charles and Erik's relationship was 'strained' from the beginning to say the least but at least we got to see why Erik(Magneto) was so stern when it came to humans and mutants and Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw was phenomenal. As far as I'm concerned xmen will be a marvel movie that will take years and years to forget if anyone wants to actually forget but this prequel to the hit franchise will make even non-marvel fans want to watch,9,0,2,2 June 2011
The Wolverine," Pretend Origins was never made!
",I want to start off by saying that read my title and trust me look at origins as never having been made. The Wolverine is a Xmen movie i can feel good about again because quite frankly ever since X2 and 'maybe' Last Stand (yes i like last stand) all xmen movies were very shall i say slow and boring. Origins was by far worse then First Class but First Class i still felt was rather slow paced and kinda bland acting for the most part. Now that we have Wolverine i feel like the films can get back on track with what made Xmen and X2 so much fun to begin with.Of course there are some points in the movie i found somewhat 'cliche' but still Wolverine is definitely Marvel's answer to the Dark Knight where its a movie about dark times and superb acting not just blowing stuff up.So even if your not an Xmen fan you still should look at this movie as pure summer fun with a brain not dumb summer fun with bad acting and no plot,8,5,11,28 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," You Don't Owe Us Anymore Mr. Nolan
","Mr Nolan has once again exceeded our expectations. The Dark Knight Rises while less complex the it's predecessor sort of lacks the action element Batman Begins and the Dark Knight had.TDKR is a very well told story, it sort of humanizes Batman/Bruce Wayne in a way that hasn't exactly been told before and just like before Christian Bale does not fail to meet our expectations in the acting department.Bane was exceptional as the main villain it was actually nice to see a so called 'less famous' villain in the sense then it would have been if Nolan put in the Riddler or Penguin but I'm glad Tom Hardy gave it his best he really blew me away. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was stunning but she was different from her comic book counterpart in just a few small ways i wont spoil anything for any one so no worries.Chris Nolan did with Batman what Sam Raimi did with Spiderman he made the character well liked and it pains us to have this franchise end but I'm glad it went out with a big bang well done Mr Nolan",8,1,8,19 July 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Dark of the Moon is DARK indeed
",i went to see the film opening night filled with higher expectations then the loud and brutal revenge of the fallen and i must say i was NOT disappointed at all. Some if most people may compare this film to be the same as the 1st film and better then the 2nd one i will say that Dark of the Moon IS the best film in the trilogy here is why i think thatWhat this movie does better then the 1st is that the 1st had more humans then bots which as i was a newcomer i got over quickly but DOTM is like a reverse role with more bots then humans in my opinion.Now what it does better then ROTF is that the bots have more personality and attitude rather then just killing each other newcomers such as que/wheeljack and the wreckers all have a pretty good profile on their shoulders But however i did find some small things that irked me a bit. First was the decepticons were back to having little to no screen time save for the rogue ( i say rogue) autobot sentinel prime. Next the final battle while probably the best was a little too long even longer then ROTF. But still to me Dark of the Moon is the best and most entertaining film in the trilogy and I'm truly sad to see Michael Bay and Shia Labeouf leave the franchise,9,0,3,4 July 2011
