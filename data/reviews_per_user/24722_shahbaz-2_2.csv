The Blair Witch Project," Disturbing Movie
","Although the idea was good, most of the scenes was so shaky and unstable that it turned out to be a great deal of torture on my eyes and brain. It took several hours to calm down my neurons after I came out of the theater. I was surprised not to see any direct scene of the true witch in the entire length of the movie. I would give it a 5 out of 100.",1,0,1,9 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Perfect; a must see movie.
","The final work by great Kubrick is really a fascinating work. Strong screenplay, strong cast, marvelous sequences and extra-ordinary background music. Basically slow in pace, but you never feel bored. It is proved that, KUBRICK can never make a bad movie.",10,0,0,21 July 1999
