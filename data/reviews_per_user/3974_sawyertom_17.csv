Requiem for a Dream," Dream Hell?! A Real Nightmare!
","Maybe it's me,and as I get older but movies like this are a complete waste of my time. This is a movie about a bunch of junkies. Sorry I can't sympathize with them as their lives go down the crapper. I know the artsy fartsy community loves these kind of dramatic message flicks,but that doesn't make them good or even entertaining for that matter. If you really feel the need to watch this movie keep the drugs and sharp objects away from you. Most of all don't watch this in a bad or depressed mood becuase you're likely to kill yourself. This movie didn't have any redeeming value. Just four losers with drug problems slowly but surely spiraling to death. Save yourself the rental and visit a drug and overdose unit in a hospital.",Null,0,1,8 June 2002
Casablanca," The Greatest of the Great Films!!!
","There is very little doubt, except from some of the younger people who have not seen much  and to them the first Star Wars film is almost ancient history that feel Casablanca is perhaps the greatest film ever made, bar none. It is that good and that great. It could be viewed as probably the most perfect movie ever made. The direction, the acting, the script, the casting, the setting, and the way things were shot is without a doubt, of the highest calibre ever made. You have great direction, great casting with even the smallest roles played by the actors to perfection. Every character is there for a reason and adds to the film even in the smallest capacity. Bogart's Rick is the perfect anti-hero as is Bergman as the woman he still loves and lost. The love story is timeless, worldly and yet surprisingly fresh. Some movies age with time, Casablanca only gets better  and more timeless, like fine wine. There can be a debate about which film is the greatest. Some may view Citizen Kane or Gone With the Wind as having the top spot and that is fine, both are worthy films and belong in the top ten. But in my humble opinion, Casablanca is the best simple because it is the perfect movie. It has stood the test of time and is the Greatest of the all-time Great films! There has been and will be nothing made that can compare to it. Casablanca is simply the greatest film ever made!",Null,0,0,24 September 2003
12 Angry Men," THE BEST DAMN COURTROOM MOVIE EVER!!!
","Twelve Angry Men was on again and for the umpteenth time I just had to watch it. No action, special effects, naked women, scary monsters or aliens. Nope none of that stuff. Instead you get a superb, if not great story with some of the best acting from different and varied actors that I have ever seen. Truly a magnificent masterpiece. It is hard to believe that 12 men in a claustraphobic jury room would make for an entertaining and engrossing movie.But, it does so brilliantly. There is no courtroom drama with lawyers that packs the punch that this movie does. It makes for a bit of a civics lesson as well. You can't help but feel locked into this room with these 12 guys with radically different lives and personalities. I think it would be interesting to see a 12 angry women passing judgement on an accused rapist. I think this story is timeless and will always work because of the basics of the story. Great hard hitting writing, great powerful dramatic story, great direction,great performances and acting. After viewing it last night, I'm going out to buy it. This movie isn't a rental, it is without a doubt a buyer. There aren't any better than this in this genre.",Null,0,1,22 February 2002
Finding Nemo," GO FISH!!!
","Talk about an instant classic! Pixar and Disney have done it again!Thank God! I put this up there with the Toy Story  and A Bug's Life as instant animation classics. I loved this movie. IT was very funny and quite well done. The voices for the sea characters were perfect to a tee. Albert Brooks was superb and  Ellen DeGeneras was, in a word GREAT! Dorey has to be one of the more memorable cartoon characters in Disney history. She and Willem Dafoe almost stole ths how. There is a plethora of enjoyable characters ranging form the title character and his father to Dorey, the sea turtles, the sharks and their twelve step program to the even the human characters. One of the funniest and probably underappreciated aspects was how the seagulls were portrayed. Anytime they saw food or potential food they said 'Mine' Having dealt with real seagulls up close that fit those annoying birds personas very well. This movie is great fun for the whole family. I would pay $7.50 to see it again. I can hardly wait to buy it on video. All I can say is go see it and GO FISH!!!",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
A Bridge Too Far," A Brilliant Failure
","This movie is very accurate in it's depiction of the Cornelius Ryan book. It shows how General Mongomery's lack of planning and adapting to changes in when given new information really screwed the British red devil paratroopers. Mongomery was the best general the German's had, even if he was English. He was inept. Damned the consequence His plan had to work even if there was an armored division in Arnhem where his paratroopers would land. The Red Devils deserved better than that and instead were practically wiped out. The movie acurrately showed what a waste the brave 82nd airborne daylight river crossing was only to have the British armor stop for tea time a mile away from rescuing their own Paratroops. Some have commented on American's acting like we have been a part of every major conflict for 300 years. They ought to watch this movie to see their own militaries ineptitude and hardheadedness.No wonder the Australians and the New Zealanders would not let the British have control of their men in World War Two. They wasted their own resources. This movie is great in that regard. Never mind the facts, shut up do the plan and drink your tea. The Red Devils deserved much better than what support they got. The movie is very solid, well-acted and entertaining. It gave a pretty realistic depiction. I hope one day they pay these brave men a tribute with a movie about pegasus bridge where they were successful.The only thing is I would have like to have seen a lot more of that bumbling fool Montgomery who masterminded this fiasco of a mission. This is a must for all war movie fans.",Null,0,1,23 March 2002

We Were Soldiers," A Disturbingly Haunting Classic
","I have had the privilege and honor of interviewing many Vietnam vets. This movie has my heart go out to those men who fought, served and even died there. This movie is graphically disturbing and like some of the other comments is not for everybody. I hate to sound sexist, but it would be wise gentlemen to see without your significant other, wife, girlfriend, etc. We Were Soldiers portrays the carnage, destruction, and brutally very well. It is every bit the classic that Platoon was. It is probably more gory and gruesome than even Saving Private Ryan. It portays the North Vietnamese Regulars and the Americans as both brave, capable and hard fighters in a very respectfully way.Nobody was made out to be a hero, just brave men fighting a desperate battle. The most telling scene in the  whole movie is when General Westmoreland wanted Col. Moore to leave the battle to give him a briefing.That scene  shows the brain trust of Westmoreland, LBJ, Macnamara, the Joint Chiefs and the others were hopelessly out of touch and derelict in their duties to not only these men, other servicemen and most of all the country. This movie is very well done and ranks with some of the all-time best war movies. It is powerful and moving. It also makes you realize what a waste getting into Vietnam was. This should receive some recognition come academy award time.",Null,0,1,19 March 2002
The Shining," All Work And No Play Make Stanley Bad Director!
","Enough of the crap already! Puleeze! Let's face it, Kubrick fans this version of the Shining is pure and simple crap! Doodoo, Kaka, s**t. Your exalted, genius director of perfection really misfired on this one.Don't give me this bulls**t that that we don't understand his genius in movie making.He blew it on the shining. Am I saying Kubrick is a bad director. No. Only on this picture. He has had some great films and I have enjoyed them. This is one of the exceptions. You Kubrick fans come off as sycophants who feel you genius can do no wrong here. You need to get out of your Kubrick enduced trances and put down the Kubrick Kool-aid, this movie doesn't even resemble the book. Oh, yeah the characters and the hotel's name is the same, but little else is. First of all, some of you critics say that Stephen King didn't like this movie because he had wrote the book and that he was too close. Well Kubrick made the movie so wouldn't any of his ideas he put into it make him too close to it as well? Kubrick's major problem is that he doesn't seem to have a grasp on good and evil. That does play a factor in the Shining. In the book anyways. Secondly it's a little hard to take Jack Nicholson serious as a mad slipping into madness after playing a character who was in a mental hospital in One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest. What in the hell is wrong with a director who has one of his characters talking to his finger in the mirror as an imaginary friend? Couldn't they afford the money to have an actor play the imaginary friend. That was totally stupid. Then again, you Kubrick groupies are convinced that is genius. It takes all kinds I guess. You can say the Kubrick's version is loosely based on the book. Hell, I'd say very loosely. It is so loosely the damn thing collapses under Kubrick's ego. Where is the details of the book it was supposed to be based on? You Kubrick fans just can't admit, you genius icon who can do no wrong made a piece of celluloid manure. Face it, this is one of his worst movies. Not only is the movie miscast, it is misdirected. Kubrick was the wrong man for the task. Spielberg, Wise or Carpenter might have been a better fit for this movie. They at least have had track records with horror/ fantasy. Can any of you Kubrick sycophants really tell me with a straight face that a movie that deviates from the book on a major scale is better than one that follows the book? get real. Your letting your infatuation with director blind your judgement. Face it this movie, this version of The Shining sucks. This version should be flushed, great director or not. I laughed more than I was scared.Even the greats screw up now and then. If you want to see a good Shining rent the 1997 mini series. It's a hell of a lot closer to the book. This is major crap and should be flushed!",Null,0,1,25 July 2002
American Beauty," Get Ready To kill Yourself After This One.
","I guess I am amongst the people who just didn't get this film. Personally I really thought that it flat out sucked. It was way overrated for all of the accolades that it received. Was there anybody in this film that you could relate to or feel empathy for? Except for the two homo neighbors there was nobody likable in the whole movie. There isn't anybody I would want for a neighbor in this for that matter. This must be Hollywood's(Disfunctional Capital of the World) idea of suburbia. They have everybody as depressed, unhappy and goofy as most of Hollywood is. I still can't believe this piece of celluloid crap won best picture. Warning: Don't go see this if you are depressed.You almost wished that some terrorists would come in and cap all of these people in the ass in this movie. It would have been a hell of a lot more cheerful. Talk people in a movie with a bad need for prozac.Hell, Platoon or Titanic was more cheerful and uplifting than this.",Null,0,1,11 April 2002
The Patriot," Very Entertianing Revolutionary War Film
","The Patriot was a very entertaining Revolutionary War film. It was  very good but not great. The thing that a lot of you are missing is that you have to remember Hollywood has a habit of making the bad guys in these things even worse than they actually were. Gibsons' character wasn't as saintly as he was portrayed and Issac's character wasn't as bad as he was portrayed either. That is from what I had read about them. It was to make the story and the movie more dramatic. No big deal. As for the critics that mentioned about our involvement in Vietnam and Korea. No defense on Nam, but Korea was a totally different matter. It was sanctioned by the UN to defend South Korea. We did not go willy-nilly in there like Nam. Read your damn history before you comment on it. As for portaying the English as on a higher ground because they gave up slavery before us. Remember, they were the premier colonial power for many years from India and the Middle East, Africa, America and Asia. They managed to rob and take anything of value to their empire for a lot of years. As for resorting to guerrila tactics, that was unconventenial warfare that worked best against the British then. You don't stand toe to toe with a superior force or army and expect to win. You fight to your strength and their weakness. The movie had its cliche's and moments that were incredulous to say the least. But it also had its powerful moments too. But in the end it was just a movie.A pretty good and entertaining one at that.",Null,1,4,3 February 2003
Cross of Iron," I'll Show You Where the Iron Crosses Grow!
","Cross of Iron has to rank as one of the best war movies ever made. I rank it up there with All Quiet On The Western Front. The opening children's song with the beginning of the movie is very haunting, if not totally ironic, abstract and thought provoking.The story of a German platoon on the Eastern Front is very well done. The acting and the story are excellent. This is probably my favorite performance by James Coburn as Steiner a war-weary German Sergeant. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. There is brutality between the Russians and the Germans as well as to their own people. If you are going to rent a bunch of war movies Cross of Iron belong up there with Saving Private Ryan, Platoon and All Quiet On the Western Front. This movie is often unfortunately overlooked as a great war movie and it shouldn't. It is up there with the best of them and should be honored as such.It is an outstanding movie.",Null,3,4,11 April 2002
The Commitments," The Greatest Irish Band That Never Was!!!
","The Commitments is an entertaining and very good movie about a man who wants to start an Irish soul band. He eventually recruits a full band with back-up singers that is pretty good. It shows their formation and overcoming obstacles and petty jealousies only to fall apart as they are about to possibly hit the big time. While the story sounds like a kind of tragedy it is well done, entertaining, funny,  and very different. Colm Meaney is excellent as the father of the band manager Jimmy Rabbite, who idolized Elvis even above the Pope and possible even with God.The band is filled with characters ranging from boars, nitpickers, hotheads,bitchy attitudes and just average people who love music. The most heartwarming part of the whole movie was where they were riding the bus and all singing Destination Anywhere. They were never closer, except for a few times on stage as a band.Even the lead singer wanted to hog the spotlight and become an even bigger prick than he was. The whole cast as well as the story was excellent. This has to be one of the better movie soundtracks to come out of a movie ever.As it is, this movie is worth just a look for the music alone. Fortunately, there is a pretty damn good story to match the soundtrack. The Commitments is a sure a helluva lot better than the Irish Rovers as a band.",Null,1,2,26 June 2003
The Dirty Dozen," The Great Male Bonding Flick
","Say what you want about the Dirty Dozen but it has a great story, with great characters and lots of great action.Think of almost all of the tough actors and you got them here. Marvin, Bronson, Brown, Walker, Borgnine, Ryan, Savalas and Cassavettes. Was there a better psycho than savales' Maggot? Some of these guys, like Maggot should have been hung. Others like Jefferson, were only defending themselves in a fight and ended up killing in self-defense. Most of them were redeemable. Some were not. That is part of the story. A last chance reprieve to destroy a heavily fortified German controlled chateau. As for the people who carped about them killing civilians, so what. These were probably the same people who turned in jews to the concentration camps, cheered Hitler and started the friggin war in the first place. Sometimes in war you have to be worse than the the people you were fighting and if a few enemy civiliians get in the way oops too bad and boo-hoo. Then don't start a war and support an evil leader. It's called collateral damage and believe me the dirty dozen does enough colatteral damage and then some. This isn't a movie for wussies. Truly a classic with some truly great tough guy actors in it. The Dirty Dozen gets 12 Stars!!!",Null,1,2,18 March 2002
Saving Private Ryan," The Best Damned war Movie Ever Made!!!
","This is the best damned war movie ever made made...Bar none. As a freelance writer I have had the priviledge to interview veterans from WW 1 & 2, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. My grandfathers were in WW2 as well.My dad was in the 82nd Airborne and he had sergeants that were in the D-Day drop. They have told me how this is the closest thing and best depiction of what it was like. Who am I to argue. They were there. We weren't. They praised the accuracy of the weapons, the characters, their actions and the combat. Plus it was a damn good story. The next most commented on item was how the army after the Sullivans tragedy was damned if it did and damned if it didn't rescue Private Ryan.Like Schindler list, this movie should be shown in high school history classes as part of their lessons on WW2. Veterans told me they would include The Longest Day and Tora, Tora, Tora in that category as well. Too many people knock it because of it's big budget. I don't understand that. The movie works in every way. I first saw SPR up in Alpena, Michigan where it was filled with mostly older WW2 generation people. Some were veterans. They had their wives with them. When we left there wasn't a sound made. Nobody said a word exiting the theatre. SPR touched the crowd that much. I had a Vietnam vet who I work with say that after he saw the movie he was sad/depressed for about three days afterward. he said Platoon didn't even affect him that way. Isn't that the sign of a great movie of this type? One that reaches out and makes you feel things you never felt or experienced before.One that actually moves you very deeply. I witnessed that personally as people left the theatre. I can only hope that Spielberg makes another war movie. Hopefully, maybe one on the Battle of the Bulge.I can hardly wait for Band of Brothers on HBO this fall. This was the greatest war movie ever made. Definitely a must see.As far as the top five war movies go I would rate them this way. 1.) saving Private Ryan 2.) Cross of Iron 3.) The Longest Day 4.) The Thin Red Line 5.)tie: All Quiet On the Western Front and Platoon Honorable mention should go to: The Best Years of Our Lives, Go For Broke, Battleground, Tora Tora Tora, Patton & a Bridge Too Far.",Null,1,2,27 July 2001
The Longest Day," One of the Greatest War Films Ever Bar None!!!
","The Longest Day is one of the greatest war films ever. Bar none. The  acting, the cinematography, the storline and the acuraccy are great. if  any of you fans watch AMC watch the Backstory behind this movie. It's  amazing that it was even made. This is Zanuck's greatest work. The  perspective from the different combatants regardless of their rank is  great. Like somebody else said it did not portray the Germans as  cartoonish evil doers. It gave a good honest portrayal that I wish more  war movies would have. As a history buff I love to see movies from  other countries soldier perspectives. This captures it better than  every other war movie. The only one that comes close is Tora, Tora,  Tora. There is one drawback however and that is the rangers at Pointe  De Hoc. They did find the big guns but,they were further inland and  later destroyed before they could be used. Zanuck used this to show the  futility and waste of war. Other than that is a classic with very few  flaws. The comparison between SPR and TLD are well like comparing  apples and oranges. Yes, SPR has gritty realism that stuns you, but  like another reviewer said, this was 1962 and the movie was about the  entire scope of the battle. It was not meant to be up close and  personal like SPR. Many of us  appreciate movies from different perspctives. This is not a movie you  should not rent. You should own it as part of your video collection.  This movie may appear to be pro-war and patriotic, but Zanuck himself  said he wanted to make an anti-war film. I think he did so  magnificantly. He captured the essence of the book where Cornelius Ryan  said he wrote about the men,not the battles. That is why Zanucks film  is so successful. He captured the men and their feelings, whether they  were American, British,German's or French and what they were feeling  going into one WW2's most decisive battle. This is a Four Star  Classic!!!!",Null,88,107,16 March 2003
Black Hawk Down," Modern warfare at it's Most Brutal
","This movie is a disturbing picture of how our understrength men fought off thousands of a warlords' somalians when we first went there as on humanitarian mission. It, very powerfully showed it's waste. You did not get to know the characters like you did in Saving Private Ryan but the performances and the gritty realism was excellently portrayed. This film will make you mad. It sure did me. How could our then President and Les Aspin send in our men without tank or other support. More blame should have been placed on them for this. It was their follies. What really got me mad was we went in peace to feed the hungry, when a warload did not care enough for his own people and gunned them down. The deaths of our men is too high a cost to feed a bunch of ungrateful heathens anywhere in the world and not just Africa, who hate us anyways. I did enjoy the scene when the  Somalie kid accidentally shoots his father when he tried to hit a ranger who had slipped. Too bad the ranger didn't off the kid, since he was a combatant. The movie was powerful, gripping and mad you mad emotionally because we still really haven't learned it's lessens. This movie makes you feel that the next time we think about helping a nation like that, we should just let the bastard's starve and save our own men from the potential dangers. A very brutal film about a brutal incident. Four stars for the grim portrayal.",Null,0,0,11 November 2002
Kong: Skull Island," An Entertaining, Fun Popcorn Movie
","Lighten up guys! Of course this movie isn't a serious drama and has some flaws, but I found it fun and entertaining nonetheless. It's not as bad as it is made out to be. Sure like all movies of this genre you have to turn off your brain and suspend all disbelief, but isn't that why we go to the movies in the first place? To escape reality? Like I said, I found this movie fun, entertaining, and a fast-paced ride. The cast was good and played their roles adequately. I also enjoyed some of the humor to the movie as well. Though, I have to admit I would like to see more of Tom Hiddleston's and Brie Larson's characters. Hopefully they are in a sequel. I thought the film made Kong out to be more of a protective guardian type which was alright with me. I liked to see a few more of the secondary character live. But, all in all, I enjoyed it. I guess if I had a complaint it would have been the lack of other prehistoric monsters in it. But, otherwise this is pure mindless, entertaining fun and should be viewed as such. Is it perfect no, but it is entertaining. The last time I listened to a critic about a movie I was bored out of my mind. So, if you want serious, critically acclaimed drama, this is not for you. But if you just want pure, dumb fun and action, this will fit the bill nicely.",7,0,0,27 June 2020
