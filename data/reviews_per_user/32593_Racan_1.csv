Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Mixed Bag
","I thought Episode 1 did have its moments but even being a huge Star Wars nut, I thought the movie had many flaws.The music was innovative and had a great score done by none other than John Williams.I felt there wasn't enough emphasis on the storyline and certain elements weren't explained enough like the Sith War and Darth Maul. The characters also suffered from not being explained enough. Darth Maul just sort of showed up and fought with no backround explained about him.The acting done by Liam Neeson and Ewan MacGregor was wonderful.But you had your share of characters which were just useless. One immediately coming to mind is Jar Jar Binks, the voice talent is nicely done, however, I see him as being like the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi, only being there for the amusement of the children.Being a Star Wars fan it was hard to dislike the movie but it seemed too much about the action than about the old good versus evil plot. See it if you're a hardcore Star Warsian, back away otherwise.",Null,0,1,3 January 2000
