First Man," Fantastic!!
","This film is predominantly about Neil Armstrong's life. Regarded as the most famous man in human history, it tells the story from the beginning, going through his rollercoaster life. This largely explains why Goslings performance which was brilliant, was also minimal. He played Armstrong, especially towards the end, as this isolated, emotionless Extremely professional person. Lacking the ability to communicate with his family and friends. Chazelle nails it again and is becoming Hollywood's new Go To director. Also... the main thing I want to acknowledge in this film is Justin Hurwitz score. Not sure if this film should've had me near tears, but the score is that remarkable I found myself in that state. It's a feat that should be recognised.",9,0,2,23 January 2019
Aquaman," Drowning in happiness
","Having seen this movie three times i cannot say enough good things. There are corny moments which I accept are part and parcel of comic movies. For example being in the middle of a war and people start kissing....Think we should let that clichÃ© go in peace now..BUT... I truely appreciate the way this film is done. It's not there to be loved by critics and revered as revolutionary. It's a simple origin comic movie that is made to be enjoyable in every way. The underwater scenes were remarkable, the acting was spot on, the motivations were all very believable! I do really think this film is the beginning of a new DCEU! Shout outs to Mamoa, Heard,Wilson all fantastic. ORM real stand out!!",8,2,3,9 January 2019
Aladdin," Cannot understand people's negativity.
","If you're a pessimist, if you usually see negatives in a film, if you want to dislike films then you might find problems. The culture of hating movies is too strong at the moment and I don't understand why, probably social media? Could just be arrogance. I mean... look at the way people have voted game Of thrones and captain marvel just of recent. However, as someone that loved the original and loves movies and tries to go into every film positive... I can tell you now that this film is absolutely brilliant. There isn't much to differentiate from the original, but what was different was brilliant and timely. It's not a deep film, but it's happy, emotional and hilarious. All of the actors are brilliant. Jafar impressed more than I thought he would... but I can say now, it's very simple. WILL SMITH IS A GENIUS. The man took an iconic role that involved so much character, and put a twist on Robin Williams version, without also killing the character he created. It was just brilliant. Very very pleased with it. Definitely watch and judge for yourself.",8,3,13,23 May 2019
Midsommar," Dreadful.
","Utterly utterly dreadful. The story was drivel for starters, but just the way that everything went about was just.... like...... I'm just lost for words. 7.5/10? For what? Was it unique? Yes and at times visually very good, however the terrible story, monotone limp acting, over the top running time and the GOD AWFUL score really did make this an excruciating experience. I mean come on, this group of people are gunna watch This cult murder people and when their mates go missing, they ASSUME THEYVE JUST GONE FOR A WALK OR SOMETHING?! Eurgh.... the only tension build up was me waiting for the end credits. Midsommar was to my account, one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. Next..",2,25,43,25 September 2019
Green Book," Doesn't get much better.
","The story isn't something overly new. A white guy that has racist tendencies befriends a black guy and everyone's happy. HOWEVER. This story... the whole tour, the way they're both completely different in every single way, yet compliment eachother so perfectly. The way they learn from one another... whether that's about food, music, decorum... anything. This film is truely heart warming and one film I will be talking about for a while. The two leads were exceptional. Not really a surprise as they're both Tremendous in anything they do, but their cohesion on this film is what makes this such a delight. Please watch this",9,1,1,21 January 2019
