Hereditary," Evicsirating, psychological nightmare.
","'Herediraty' is one of the most shatteringly horrific films I have ever seen. It constantly wrings you out like a wet rag with its jet black view of a family on the brink of destruction. It's a film that will leave you batting images and sounds around in your head long after you have left the cineplex. 
One of the major reasons why is because Writer/Director Art Aster has created an astounding peice of work here, part of this film can be considered a dark family drama. The other side of this film's coin can be considered to be some of the finest American horror that has ever been put to screen. The film also features a damaging yet beautiful performance by Toni Colette. They layers of pain begin to outweigh the layers of loss, which begin to flake away into broken layers of psychological damage. As she loses her grip on reality Toni Collete begins to form one of the greatest female performances of recent memory. Stunning work. And the mantle piece of this film.",10,16,31,13 June 2018

Mulholland Drive," Definitive David Lynch!
","For anyone getting started on the films of David Lynch, this is one to watch. 'Mulholland Dr.' is one of the most original mind twisters ever made, destined to be a classic. I'm a huge fan of Lynch ever since I began watching his show 'Twin Peaks' when I was 10. I then progressed to the films, 'Elephant Man', 'Dune' (Not So Good), and finally I saw 'Blue Velvet'. That did it for me, and I was a fan for life. I've subsequently seen all his films of terrific twisted vision and 'Mulholland Dr.' just drives home the power of this film-maker's genius. Scenes at first, don't make sense, some might not at all, but in the end Lynch covers all his bases and brings everything back in a numbingly brilliant finale of images and sounds to put this puzzle together. This movie has to be, I repeat, HAS TO BE WATCHED MORE THAN ONCE to not only absorb the story but also to appreciate it's brilliance. In summary, 'Mulholland Dr.' is one of David Lynch's best films, and was my pick as the best movie of 2001. It's a different film, for sure, but if you want something original, brilliant and downright twisted, have I got the movie for you!",10,2,3,15 June 2002
Signs," Another gem from Shyamalan
","Signs was a terrific, spooky, intelligent thriller that can stand aside M. Night Shymalan's previous classic The Sixth Sense. I won't give major points of the story of Signs away, going in with little expectations for this film is a good thing. The movie goes at it's own pace (much the way Sixth Sense did) building the proper tension with use of visuals and sound design. I was on the edge of my seat watching this film, it was a creepy spook fest, emulating such classics as Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and Night Of The Living Dead. I was truly amazed at how excellent Signs was. Mel Gibson was great in his role as a troubled Priest and family man who is the center of the film. He gives a very commanding performance, one of his best. The film also contains just the right amount of humor to keep the nails from your finger being completely chewed off. This is the MUST SEE film of the summer of 2002. Not only has M. Night Shyamalan made one of the year's best films, but he also officially solidified himself as one of the best film-making talents around today!",9,0,2,25 August 2002
