Marie Antoinette," Sophie Coppola read Stefan Zweig's Marie Antoinette's to get inspiration!
","I was about to finish Stefan Zweig's biography novel about Marie Antoinette before watching this movie. %100 director got inspiration from that novel.What a sad story. Young girl from Austria royal made marriage to cut hostility between Austria and France. Anyway every aspect was directly quotation from the book that I mentioned before. I suggest the watchers who want to see this movie, they need to read great novel of Stefan Zweig who was the best autobiographer of 20s Centuries novel name: Marie Antoinette: The Portrait of an Average Woman. She was really average woman,like we are:)",3,0,0,3 September 2016
