The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Life changing
",This movie changed my life.I always thought that I had a rough life but after seeing this movie and seeing what Charlie (Logan Lerman) has been through changed my perspective.Nobody should lose a friend like that even though it happens every day. It never happened to me. Nobody should have to fight so hard to keep thinking I'm worth living this life even though people feel that way every day. It never happened to me. Nobody should have been abused like that even though it happens every day. It never happened to me.Nobody can say that their life is hard after seeing this movie. I also have great respect for Logan in this movie. It's so different from what he usually does but I believed him. I believed him the whole movie. If somebody told me that Logan has been trough that in real life I would have believed it.So in the end I think that everyone should see this movie. Not everything ends with a happy ending but you can make the best of it.,10,0,0,13 August 2013
