Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," It slaughters the book...bad.
","I read the book first myself. The book was great, I couldn't wait to watch the movie. Well...that didn't last long...the first 10 minutes of the movie tell you right away that it is not even following the book. You keep going, further in and find out that the movie doesn't follow the book or plot in any way. It was terrible. They just took the name of the movie, and the names of some of the characters and that is is. They created their own plot and story that was unrelated to the book and changed everything. Henry was one of my favorite characters in the book and they just slaughtered everything about him.If I hadn't read the book first, I would probably thought it was a decent movie...nothing great. If they would have just followed the storyline and plot of the book itself, it could have been SO much better.Overall, if you read the book...I do not suggest watching the movie...it just destroys it.",3,0,2,4 November 2012
