The Sound of Music," The Sound of Music is the greatest musical of all time and a great history lesson.
","The Sound of Music is not only the greatest musical of all time, but is also a history lesson.  In a span of almost three hours, you get to see a short tour of Austria and learn a great deal about the Von Trapp Family.  The songs are so unforgettable, that you will find yourself singing along throughout the entire film.  The Sound Of Music is a musical that will, probably, never be matched.  I highly recommend The Wizard of Oz and Mary Poppins.  As with The Sound Of Music, you will find yourself singing all the way through.",10,1,7,27 November 2001
