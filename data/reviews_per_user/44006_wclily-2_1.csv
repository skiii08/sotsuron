The Blair Witch Project," bottom corner of the screen was REAL intersting
","I'm surprised not many people have mentioned this before; I sat through 30 minutes of headaches and confusion; in these 30 minutes, the camera shot kept moving around like it was being operated by a 5-year old child.  The only at scaring me (that I noticed) was 'no! don't go in there! it's too dark! I'm too scared, don't go in!'But I'll admit that I did not really WATCH the movie.  I... stared at the bottom corner of the screen, since I got a splitting headache after 5 minutes of camera-tossing.  I get it, it's supposed to look amateur but come on, a little over the line now aren't we?of course this was only in a half hour.  45 including all those trailers... well anyway at the 30 minute mark, me and my fellow disgruntled viewers decided to get up and leave.   Luckily the theater manager understood and gave us our money back.  And also lucky for us we went in the afternoon and didn't waste TOO much of our time.  Well the rest of the day went quite well and if you know what a bad headache feels like, DON'T GO THERE.",1,1,4,1 September 1999
