The New World," Terrible (a missed opportunity to make a great film)
","First the pros: Great cinematography, very realistic. That was quick. Now the negatives: Terrible acting (Farrell doesn't change his face expression in the whole movie). I'd say terrible script if there was dialog at all; but they just utter words and short sentences. I know some will give me the 'open mind' and 'it makes you think' answer. But a little dialog wouldn't hurt.Pocahontas story was a great opportunity for a great film. This one was realistic, captured the mood of the conquerors and the natives. but It didn't have too be so boring. Three good actors leading, but not a chance to see a good characterization. At 135 minutes I think i think that it's 45 minutes too long. I don't want to force my opinions on anybody, but this is the worst movie I've seen in months; and that's a lot coming from someone who just saw 'Final Payback' a week ago.",3,0,3,31 July 2006
