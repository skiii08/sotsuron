Sucker Punch," mixed feelings.....
","Story. that's the main part of a movie. 'Sucker Punch' being the latest in a series of movies I've seen recently which seem to lack this essential ingredient, I am feeling sadder every time a movie with potential comes short and becomes a forgettable 90min entertainment flick.I am really starting to miss movies like Rain Man (great story), Sin City (what a good ride!) and even 300 (respectable one).and it's sad to see so much effort go to waste. my own experience.....well, i liked this movie. i didn't mind the CGI at all. on the contrary i felt some parts were very well made. even some scenes reminded me of Sin City. and i REALLY enjoyed the music. soundtrack choices were well placed, and i have to admit i always have a soft spot for anything with White Rabbit in it ;)but we again come back to story. and that's where it comes short. i think they tried. i believe this movie had something to say, but it was well underdeveloped.....anyway it's sad to see something having the potential of becoming a memorable movie turn into this.",6,0,0,17 January 2012
Sherlock Holmes," not as much fun as i thought it would be
","reading reviews and watching trailers i was led to believe this movie was going to be fast paced, entertaining and fun to watch. sadly it was not quite any of them. don't get me wrong, it isn't a bad movie. but if you are looking for some action, entertainment, comedy, witty dialogs, etc... you won't find much in this movie.Robert Downey's lines are sometimes boring. the story isn't that much interesting. even quite predictable at times. perhaps the only really good thing about this movie is Jude Law's acting. at least he kept his character interesting enough. over all i was disappointed and even a bit tired at the end.",5,0,0,11 January 2012
