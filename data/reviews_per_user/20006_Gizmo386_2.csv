Gremlins," The Best!
","This is my all-time favorite movie. It is funny, scary, and creative (which is lacked in today's movies). Rent it (or even better, buy it) today!",10,0,1,13 February 1999
Scream," Pathetic.
","'Scream' is the most pathetic attempt at creating scares that I have ever scene. It relies on pop-culture and humor rather than scares. I admit that some of the eighties horror movies are pretty bad, but at least they tried to be scary. This is an unfunny comedy that is very tiresome and boring. Stay clear of this and rent 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', a true horror movie.",1,4,19,1 November 1999
