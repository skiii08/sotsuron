The Avengers," Great Film, THE quintessential Superhero flick!
","There are nothing but good things I can say about The Avengers. This has got to be the first superhero film that really gave audiences everything they wanted and more.The character development was done prior to this film, so they don't need to waste time with that. They just get right to it and it works! Fortunately we already got to know Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America and (to a smaller extent) Agent Phil Colson, Black Widow, Hawk-Eye and of course Nick Fury.The story is excellent, it moves forward at a very even pace, the characters play off of each other and even have a few chicken fights here and there but not so much as to drag the story down. There are enough funny parts to keep it from being too serious and it really gives each member of the team something to do. This is everything I've desperately wanted for the Justice League to be for years now. Admittedly I'm more of a DC man, and the JLA is always gonna be my favorite team. It's a real bummer to me that audiences who aren't familiar with the comics are seeing Hawk-Eye before The Green Arrow, who has been around for a few decades prior. Oh well, you can't win them all.There are just so many great moments in the film to look forward to. If you are viewing it for the first time, watch it until the VERY END of the credits, you won't be disappointed.I can't wait to buy this when it comes out on DVD.Joss Whedon delivers the goods in every sense of the word!",10,1,5,12 September 2012
Superbad," Funny flick but...
","I saw this one on on-demand after a friend's recommendation. I wouldn't say I loved it but I wouldn't say it disappointed entirely either. This definitely had it's share of funny moments.I hate to jump on this bandwagon but I've got to admit that some of Seth's lines toward the girls ('you scratch my back etc.') were a little unnecessary. Admittedly it's been a number of years since I was in High School but I don't think that most girls would put up with someone like Seth.The one likable character in this film is Fogel (a.k.a McLovin) he's a riot! The thing about him is that he's almost accidentally funny. The situations he manages to get himself into are absolutely hilarious.It pains me to say this about a movie like this but the two main characters are just not that likable. At the end of the film, they just kind of leave you cold. I just didn't care what happened to them by the end of the film. McLovin is the man!",7,1,3,25 September 2008
Juno," One of the most overrated movies out there
","Why do people keep praising this movie? I don't get it. I remember being in high school and yes there were Junos in my school, there were Bleekers too. This suffers from the same problem as 'Superbad'. The two main characters are really not that likable. Ironically, Mr Bleeker was one of the two unlikable main characters from 'Superbad'. That's two for two! Sorry but he just really isn't. By the end of the movie I found myself not caring about him. If he got hit by a bus, that would have been a nicer plot twist. That's another thing, there was no plot twist. This movie is so linear that it's not funny. It's like a bad video game, the kind you borrow once from your buddy, beat it the first time you play it and then never play it again. The soundtrack was terrible! That was probably the one thing that REALLY grated on my nerves. Where did they find these musicians? I've seen drunks at karaoke that perform better. I swear if anyone ever brings the soundtrack to this movie to my house, I will microwave it!There's one final thing that annoyed me, that was the girl outside of the abortion clinic. They didn't have to portray her the way they did. She represents one opinion. Clearly, the writer and/or director has a wildly different one. There's no need to overstate, to cram it down the viewers throats the way they did. This just further fuels a fire, that's all it does. I don't want to watch a movie so that someone can preach to me about how they feel about these type of issues, I watch movies for entertainment. Imagine that! I give this one a 5 out of 10 for exactly two reasons: J.K. Simmons & Jason BatemanThey carried this movie.",5,2,7,21 April 2009
"Monsters, Inc."," Best Pixar Movie Ever!
","I saw this movie with my wife when it first came out in the theater. I remember we were running errands that day and just decided on seeing it spur-of-the moment. I don't regret that at all. I bought it as soon as it came out and a couple years later we had our first little one, a daughter (now two years old) who absolutely loves it. She lovingly asks for us to put it on all the time, she calls it 'Monsters'.There's lots to enjoy about this movie from the technology to music and of course the characters. You really can't say anything bad about it. First I gotta say that the voices were all very well picked. I get the biggest kick out of Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sulley (John Goodman). Their musical number at the end is cute too.The one thing I personally enjoy the most about it is that it finds a happy medium that you don't always see in movies geared toward kids. By that I mean that it's not dummied-down so that 'kids can understand it' but still keeps adults entertained. It also doesn't go overboard at trying to cram a message down your throat. This is just good fun and some laughs. You can't go wrong with this one whether the kids are home or not. For those who haven't seen it yet, go and rent it.",10,0,1,25 April 2006
Fargo," Good One!
","This is one of my wife and I's favorites. This is one of those movies that when you move and you pack up all of your stuff, you make sure you can find it so that you've got a 'safe one' to watch when you can't find anything.I saw this for the first time as a second run movie and my parents kept raving about it. I reluctantly agreed to watch it and I wasn't disappointed at all. All you had to do is say it was the same guys that put together Raising Arizona and I would have been on board, sheesh! Having only visited the Midwest and never lived there I cannot personally vouch for all of the clichÃ©s in this film but some of it was so funny. I always get a laugh out of the 'Ya's' in this movie when the two ladies are being interviewed.William H Macy was very convincing as a corrupt auto salesman. I've met too many like his character and it's just funny to see that on the big screen, especially the 'I'm just gonna go check with my boss' bit. Funny stuff!",10,0,0,16 July 2007
Man of Steel," What a treat, It's about time!
","Minor Spoilers contained within this reviewThis is the Superman that all of us die hard comic book fans have been hoping for since the beginning. That said, it's fun and enjoyable for everyone. I took my wife to see this and she can't wait to see it again, this coming from someone who normally wouldn't sit through a Superman film. Spoiler #1 There is no Kryptonite in this film, there isn't even the mention of Kryptonite. This is a bitter sweet victory for those of us that know Superman from the comics as well as the movies. Those who've only ever seen the movies are under the very wrong impression that Superman is completely indestructible accept for the influence of the green radioactive fragments of his own home planet. Fans of the comics, Smallville and movies alike know differently. We know that there are actually a variety of things that hurt him or that have affects on him. Spoiler # 2 No Lex Luthor. With the exception of Superman III, never have we seen a Superman film that didn't have Lex or a villain that is at least somewhat like him. Spoiler #3 This is probably the most important detail, Superman gets his hands dirty. This isn't a surprise to comic fans either but it is for the casual movie-goer.The origin story was fantastic. We get to see more of Krypton than ever before and it has a different look to it. Although I like Russell Crowe as an actor, I had my doubts about him being Jor-El but he quickly won me over. His portrayal is better than Marlon Brando's if you asked me. For once, we get to see him actually interact with his Son rather than just giving him fortune cookie advice. This time around, we really get a feel for just how evil General Zod is. We also get to see the type of interaction with Jor El and Zod that we only got to see previously in Kevin J. Anderson's 'The Last Days of Krypton'. In fact, I wouldn't at all be surprised if Zack Snyder either read that book or if someone on his staff did. That book told the story about Krypton's demise perfectly. It really illustrates how ceremonial Kryptonians were, the bureaucracy and their hesitancy to see their imminent demise. A front loaded origin story didn't choke this down the way I had thought it would.The metropolis scenes were amazing, the casting choices were great. Everyone pulls their weight too. Henry Cavill really does a great job as Superman. He still personifies what we all know about Superman but showing us a newer and darker side that we've never seen before. We really get to see what lengths he goes to to protect Earth. Speaking of the darker side of Superman, it's plain to see that Christopher Nolan had a strong influence with the making of this installment. This was even better than The Dark Knight and it easily paves the way for sequels and for the JLA. Amy Adams was a great pick for Lois lane. They even managed to touch on the Army brat side of her that previously we got to see on Smallville. Fans of Smallville will be happy to see that a number of actors from that show were in this movie as well. Lots of familiar faces and characters finally come to the big screen for the first time.Michael Shannon portrayed General Zod perfectly. It's hard to fill Terrence Stamp's shoes but he did so magnificently. He wasn't the one dimensional megalomaniac bent on revenge that we had seen before. There was so much more depth to his character than what we'd seen before. In conclusion, this was an amazing experience. It was great to finally see them branch out with Superman and show us the things we'd never seen but always hoped too. They didn't just give us more of the same old or recycle old scenarios with new actors. It had a very dark side to it but also stayed true to its roots. At the same time, there are still a few funny moments in there to break up the seriousness. They really went for realism and plausibility this time around too. If I elaborate more, I'll spoil too much. This is the one movie that you have to see on the big screen, it's well worth the ticket price!",10,13,22,29 June 2013
Saw III," Great Movie, Right up until the end.
","I just viewed this for the first time the other night. I had seen the first two.I loved the first one, a true masterpiece for the Horror Genre and one that'll always stand alone. No matter how many Horror flicks you've seen, the first one has major originality. They did quite a few things that hadn't been done before and did other things that had been done but did them better.I enjoyed the second one but not nearly as much as the first one.****Spoiler Time**** Killing Off the cop: (Dina Meyer) Big Mistake! She played such a small role in the other two, they barely had enough time for character development. Breaking John's tradition of giving someone a 'way out' even if it was profoundly difficult was also a mistake. Then there's the underlined thing here, I must confess that I'm a guy and like other guys out there, we hate seeing the hot woman get all messed up like that. She must like dying in a gruesome fashion in movies (Starship Troopers, Saw III). Don't worry Dina, someone out there will feel bad like me and resolve not to let you die off like that! Amanda: Huh? What? I'll admit she's not the most likable person in this one. In fact she was rather irritating. She's such a Nut Job in this one that it's kind of a relief to see her get whacked at the end. I just wonder why they bothered to kill her off right then and there.John: Last but not least we get to Jigsaw himself. Why did they bother to go to all the trouble to save him just to kill him off too? I think this could have easily been good for one more sequel if not for that.One last critique here: (***Spoilers Again****) The two plot twists: The bit with Amanda and The bit with the Jeff just really seemed tired and unnecessary. Maybe one of the two would have been both but in this case more just wasn't better. I think they could have done without one of them.Now with all that in mind, this was a good movie. I really enjoyed the new traps and the new goodies they had. The last one they showed was particularly ingenious, gruesome but ingenious. The twisting of the mechanisms was particularly hard to watch.I hope they're able to pull off Saw IV.",8,1,2,9 July 2007
The Princess Bride," This movie is a Classic!
","Way to go Rob Reiner! Anyone with the same birthday as me and who will forever be remembered as meathead can't be all bad. This was well cast, well written and it's fun to watch. The lines are hilarious, anyone who was around in the 80's is gonna love those great lines. Fezzik's rhyming, the gate key scene, the sword fight and of course Billy Crystal's 'Mostly Dead' bit. That just kills me and I've seen it many times. I also have fond memories of doing the sword fight scenes with friends, 'I am not left handed either'. I've read a lot of the other reviews of this movie. For those of you who love it, right on! It's a good movie to love, it's funny and well written. For those who didn't like it, I don't understand why. I would rate this one a perfect 10********** out of 10.",10,0,1,13 May 2004
Schindler's List," Thought provoking but hard to watch certain scenes
","Spielberg did a great job of depicting the horror of what went on during the holocaust. It's very historically accurate (a rarity now a days). I have a whole new respect for this film in learning that Spielberg refused to take a salary for it. His reasoning behind it is admirable also.(Spoiler Alert)There were a few scenes where my stomach was in knots and I needed to take a break from it. One was the scene where the little girl in red (seen running in the streets early on) is later seen dead. The one handed machinist execution was hard too. The very worse part (emotionally) is the Auschwitz scene, It's not so much what you see, it's what you do not see. The Jews are being lined up for their own deaths. The only thing you really see is them being lined up to go into the incinerator room. That's enough though, the image of the smoke stack is enough to make it real. Near the end when the Russians hung Amon Goeth, I remember thinking it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. Also the speech that Schindler gave to the remaining guards at the camp was really something. They had a choice between murder and doing the humane thing. When they left as 'men instead of murderers' that was moving. It's almost like there was a glimmer of hope there. I highly recommend this film to anyone, just make a point to take a break from it every so often.",10,9,13,29 November 2004
Gran Torino," Great Movie, not enough good things I can say about it
","Warning: there will be multiple spoilers contained herein and I will give ample warning in advanced.Walt is a bitter, old bigot whose views on life in general have been galvanized by war, family issues and his ever-changing neighborhood. He also is mourning the loss of his wife. His constant racist remarks are actually funny in spite of themselves. I have learned an entire vocabulary of nasty sayings because of this film. The more you get to know Walt, the more you start to see why he is the way he is and you feel bad for the guy. He doesn't have the best relationship with his son, something that he feels bad about. He's basically alone until some new neighbors move in next door. Thao, one of his new next door neighbors is a troubled Hmong youth whose (Spoiler) gang initiation is to steal Walt's prized muscle car, a 1972 Gran Torino that he made off of the line when he was working for Ford.Spoilers: At the funeral of his wife near the beginning, there is a scene where you see the grand daughter at her grandmother's funeral, dressed like a slut, exposing a belly button ring and a lip ring and she text messages on her phone during the funeral. At this point the film tries to do two things; one is that you can see the irritation on Walt's face at how times had changed and not necessarily for the better. Then you get it from the point of view of the kid and you see how the parents don't care. Yes, times have changed but it's a funeral! The grand daughter then goes on to ask dear old grandad (that she doesn't give a damn about) for a couch.He doesn't like Thao right from the beginning and for obvious reasons but later you find that his relationship with Thao and with his sister Sue are the best relationships he has. The interactions throughout the movie with Walt and the Priest are awesome! The confession scene is pretty hilarious too. (More Spoilers) Toward the halfway mark in the film things start getting more serious, there is gang violence, rape and ultimately death. The movie takes you on one hell of a ride but it's something that doesn't leave you feeling horrible despite the sad nature of the ending. It actually serves to give closure to Walt and to all around him. For me, a great moment was at the end when you see that his Son and Grand Daughter are both equally disappointed that neither of them inherited his prized Gran Torino. Despite Walt's grumpy and unpleasant nature, you really come to like the guy. He's a good person, he stands up for what is right and he does the most just and noble thing at the end in the name of saving the only people that truly cared about him.This is a must see film!",10,0,2,9 September 2012
Transformers," Great adaptation of the original cartoon series
","I was a big fan of the original in the 80s, I was that age group that the toys/cartoons targeted. When at first I heard about this, I rolled my eyes and though of how bad it could be.I was very wrong. This is a good film. The story is there, the graphics are great and the lineage of the Transformers is nice. There are a handful of funny moments too. It's nice to see that this isn't one of those films where all of the good parts are represented in the theatrical trailer. That seems to be the case so often now a days.For me, watching the Autobots transform from the cars/trucks etc into the characters we grew up with in the 80's was a great part of the film. You look up at them and go whoa! I remember that from when I was a kid! Good Job Michael Bay!",10,5,8,25 September 2008
Saw II," Good but not as good as the first!
","Good, but it just wasn't as good as the original.Donnie Whalberg really delivers the goods. He's believable as a cop, as a dad and as a man bent on vengeance. Kudos all around! The guy can act. It didn't seem to end too well for him. They didn't really fully explain that, they didn't really answer that in Saw III either. They just sort of hinted at a couple scenarios.There is another big unanswered question, what happened to Dr. Gordon? In the first one, it certainly did look very bleak for him. I'll be the first to admit, I thought for certain he was toast. That said, I watched this movie very carefully and I never saw a body. Whether his body would be 'recognizable' as him I don't know? But where was he? They were most certainly in the correct building and even in the very room where he took his own leg off. What happened to him? There's definitely two very logical situations but neither of them is played out in this one nor in Saw IV. Hopefully we'll find out in Saw III. Also, I really hope to see Donnie Wahlberg reprise his roll in Saw IV. He was a very valuable asset to the series.",8,0,1,9 July 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Nowhere near as good as the Original
","I share Gene Wilder's sentiment on this one. 'Hey, let's see if we can make more money off of Willy Wonka' I hate to cut down a movie like this but it's in my all time top 5 bad ones.Why? Bad, Bad Bad! I Don't know where to start, they really flushed this one down the toilet. I like Tim Burton, I like Johnny Depp, I've liked everything I've seen Christopher Lee in also but this, eeek! First of all what is with the face make-up? This is Willy Wonka Folks, Not Michael Jackson.He just wasn't likable either! The character development on him didn't work, it was several minutes of un-needed film. It didn't help the movie.His bit about cannibalism: Not Funny His bit about his old factory employees: Not Funny I may as well prepare myself for this one because I know that someone out there is reading this comment and thinking 'But, they tried to follow the book with this one'.Okay, they did the chocolate palace and the squirrel bit and therefore they get credit for 'following the book'. The movie still sucks! They took a classic, a family-oriented masterpiece and royally messed it up. I don't care what they 'followed' it just wasn't good this time around.Johnny Depp should have quit after reading the script to this, I've seen him do so much better before.While we're at it why don't we re-do the Sound of Music with Brittney Spears as Maria von Trapp. Wait, never mind, forget I mentioned that. Just my luck, someone will probably do that.Gotta give this one a 2 0ut of 10 just for casting, the kids good performance and for a few funny bits. The rest of it is really painful to watch.",2,4,7,15 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Great addition to a Great Series, Nice Adaptation of the Book!
","I've read all of the books, a few of them more than once. It's very hard to adapt one of these books to the big screen without making them twice as long as Lord of The Rings. There's so much to cover.There are a few details of the book that were particularly powerful and it's too bad that they left them out. One of them (Spoiler Alert) this is admittedly more of a book spoiler than anything now. In the book, there is an interesting little event that becomes quickly swept under the rug. While at Grimuld Drive, they find a locket that no one can seem to figure out a way to open. In the next book, it's discovered that Voldemort has many Horcuxes. We come to find out that those are a big part of what's keeping him from dying. Then there's the painting of Sirius' mom who yells at everyone calling them blood traitors, half breeds etc. There's only a subtle hint of Sirius and Bellatrix being cousins. They also didn't play out two scenes I was really looking forward to.One was toward the beginning, Mad-Eye Moody was chiding Harry for putting his wand in his back pocket. He said something to the effect of 'More than one talented wizard has blown off a buttock that way!' To which Tonks replied: 'Who do you know who's blown off a buttock that way?' Then Moody replies 'Um, Nevermind.' Everyone in the room kind of chuckled for a bit. When Harry addresses Moody as Professor, he kindly reminded him that he didn't actually do much teaching.Last but not least, we find out that Lucius Malfoy, Crabbe's Dad, Goyle's Dad, McNair (the would-be executioner of Buckbeak from 'The Prisoner of Askaban') and a few other death-eaters were ambushed at the ministry and arrested. The boys were none too happy about their Dads getting arrested and Malfoy vowed to get Harry at the end of the book.The other parts I missed were kind of silly but that last one was a particularly powerful part of the book. It really kept you waiting for the next one which picks up right where the last one left off. A very nice touch if you asked me.All in all, excellent movie! The darkest one in series of movies (so far) and proof that the books are not just aimed at a younger audience. True that the younger audience tends to be intrigued by it but this is a great series.",10,0,4,31 July 2007
Saw," A Shining Gem for the Horror Industry
","Bravo! This is what it's all about. It's not for the faint of heart or should I say stomach in some scenes but it's a really good Horror flick. Jigsaw (John) personifies evil and true mental sickness. He's bitter at the world for the cancer eating at him. He gets back at the people who he feels have done wrong by putting them in situations that either result in a painful (usually drawn-out) death or a very difficult escape. It really keeps you going the whole time.I think that people who require constant stimulation in movies will probably not like this one because it's kind of a time-release film. The character development is right on too. You really get attached to Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell's Characters. Despite what some may say, I think the final plot twist at the end was a particularly good one. I also think that people who are gonna say 'I saw that coming' or 'It was predictable' are full of it! This was new territory for a Horror film. There's been some similar stuff but you've gotta admit that it really does go into some uncharted territory.Awesome Film, A must rent for us hard-core Horror fans. (Just be careful what you eat when you're watching this if you have a soft stomach)",10,1,3,9 July 2007
The Legend of 1900," Great Film, two words 'sea legs'
","A friend rented this one and brought it over to me a couple months ago. From beginning to end this was a good one. I think that movie fans and music fans alike can enjoy this. For one thing, I used to play the trumpet and still play piano a bit and the way the characters play is amazing. The piano duel is about on par with the famous guitar duel from 'Crossroads' (Steve Vai and Ry Cooder). There are a number of good laughs in this too. Particularly the famous gaining the sea legs scene with Max and 1900. That just about had me on the floor laughing. The cigarette on the piano scene was also memorable. The ending was a big tear-jerker though. This is a good film for couples to watch together, just have a box of tissues on standby at the end. I give this one a perfect 10/10 a must rent movie.",10,0,1,27 May 2003
WALL·E," Great piece of film, teaches a lot of great life lessons
","Pixar has done it again! I love their films, I can sit and watch any of their films with the kids and I enjoy them just as much as they do. My favorite one is still 'Monsters Inc'.Wall-E teaches us some great life lessons though. Some of it's obvious, with regards to trash for example. It's definitely a good idea to recycle and try not to trash the whole world (or space too in the case of this movie) but there's some great advice in their besides that.Wall-E takes us to a world where technology has made us all extremely lazy to the point where nobody does anything for themselves anymore. Not only that but it has made people anti-social toward other people. The very technology that people are so fascinated with could lead to our own undoing. By immersing ourselves in video games and online chatting all day long, we forget what it's like to just get out and talk to people...imagine that! The film isn't preachy though. It gives out advice and shows that this is one particular path we could all be headed in if we're not careful. It's great fun for the kids too. It's amazing how you start to feel genuine empathy for two robots and a cockroach.Fun for the whole family, I recommend it very highly",10,2,5,16 September 2008
