Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This Movie Rocks.....Just in a different way
","A lot of people did not like this movie because it didn't live up to the original trilogy. I understand and can see where they are coming from but I personally disagree. Episode 1: The Phantom Menace was not supposed to live up to the complete glory which was the original trilogy, this movie was supposed to be the start of the Star Wars saga. It accomplished this very well.This is the beginning of Star Wars and it's soul mission in life was to introduce you to Anikin Skywalker. They showed his roots, they showed his upbringing and they introduced him very well. The movie left off making you think 'how is that little innocent boy going to grow up to kill all of the Jedi?' and that is exactly what it was supposed to do. This movie did it's job perfectly.",8,0,1,21 April 2005
