Hereditary," This movie lost its head
","Slow start.
Brutal middle, which became a very dark torturous family drama. Ripped apart by a very dark tragedy.
Movie was getting somewhere.
Then everyone died and someone became a lost king of hell.. for some reason.I can tell the director loves paganism and it's symbology. That's cool, more movies need to handle that subject better.
But the end just got sloppy.I would have preferred if the tiny people in the model houses were alive or it turned out the family was also just someone else's models that were being build and destroyed. Couldnt be worse than floating headless bodies.What a waste",3,1,3,28 February 2020
Midsommar," Long and predictable
","So the Swedish friend invited all the guys to his death cult to be part of the 9 sacrificed to their gods. Fair enough, decent enough premise. But meanwhile he was really trying to get his friends girlfriend along to be may queen, who was never told about the trip until basically they were leaving? Also they were trying to get him to break up with her?Once I noticed that plot hole early on I was tapped out.Occult and pagan rituals are very interesting but handled very oddly here.Also why wouldn't the students doing phds in that subject be able to speak the language?
Writers need to learn some chops and not just glance at Wikipedia for notes.",2,2,9,28 February 2020
