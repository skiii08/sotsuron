Requiem for a Dream," It's about our, and their, dreams.
","Most people will tell you that this movie is about drugs and their price. I believe this to be wrong. The title itself should remind us to focus on these people's dreams. Drugs are involved, yes, but that is not what this movie is about. The important part of this movie is the dreams of the each of the characters. Their dreams are what make us care about them, a must in any good movie. This movie wouldn't be as touching, as disturbing, as wonderful if we all didn't share and understand each of the character's dreams.",10,1,2,17 August 2002
Mulholland Drive," Worth the watch, definitely.
","Lynch himself allows that his movies are up for multiple interpretations, No? Well, I like that. Watching it, I like the feeling that my guesses about what's 'really' happening are getting closer to right. After reading 'spoilers' and hints to the meaning, I like going to look at the movie in a different way. This allows you to see the story in different ways each time. Each of these different ways has a possibility of conveying different meaning. Also, to all you people who don't like the fact that there are so many loose ends: I trust the director in that if they needed to be tied up, they would be. Some things may not need to be tied up for it to come together the way the director wants. Also, I notice from reviews, even after people 'figure out' the movie, they don't like the plot because it's simply 'this' or simply 'that'. I hear this about a lot of movies that you have to think about to figure them out. I guess people expect a life-changing story to be uncovered just because they had to work at it. At worst, the plot is equal to that of most movies. Most of the time, it's better than most popular big hit movies. These people must not like to think, and that's a sad thing, they should just go watch paint peel or something.",Null,0,1,17 August 2002
