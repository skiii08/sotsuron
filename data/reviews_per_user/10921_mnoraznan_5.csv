Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A Must-See Satirical Horror + History Mash-Up
","I have to be honest...The idea first feel absurd to me.Upon seeing the film however, i have to tip my hat to Timur for attempting something such as this. Imagine... taking a historical figure + setting and mashing it up with a concept so bizarre that it beggars belief.Abraham Lincoln is indeed a figure well-respected in his home country for ending slavery. However, he also has slaves in his employ. This duality and conceit in his person is magnified even further in this movie. By transforming him into a vampire hunter, he is at once the savior of humanity while appearing more distant than ever from the issue of slavery. He only ends the trade because it suited his anti-vampire agenda. The fact that actions ended slavery is treated as just a by-product, rather than being the main issue.As such, i implore you, dear reader! Visit your nearest film house and surrender your money. Not because this is a triumph of literature and movie-making. But instead, suppress your laugh at seeing an outrageous figure by treated outrageously. Sate your curiosity with the effects! Quench your expectation at the fumbling mannerism called acting.This is an absurdist fare at its best. If you will join me in simulating approval with a cynical sneer. I confess, after torturing my eyes with this farce, laughing is a spontaneous reaction. Bravo for this absurd concoction!",9,3,6,13 October 2012
The Hunger Games," Lazy adaptation
","One Word: RushedI had high hopes for this movie. It could've been much better. Instead, it is just a normal popcorn flick that takes its source material for granted. Some important scenes doesn't have a proper lead-in to explain the action. Some were left out entirely. This makes some of them have less impact than what they were gunning for, instead, it induces awkwardness, even if one knows the reason for the scene. I'm not even talking about the symbol of the story that have been reduced to mere trinket. So, my advice is, go and see the movie with your hopes dialed down. This is not a faithful adaptation, even the casting is way off. Its a shame really, such misstep is truly unexpected. It could've trumped Twilight and takes its place as the leader in teen movie franchises. Instead, it happily place itself in the middle of the pack. I guess, THE ODDS IS NOT IN YOUR FAVOR, THG.",6,5,13,25 March 2012
Edge of Tomorrow," This movie hits the spot! Watch without worry...
","I liked oblivion and so this should come as a no surprise.SPOILERS ABOUNDS. Read at your own risk. At first, the design of the armor irks me, it looked bare and not what one would imagine a powered exoskeleton would look like. Too many exposed sections, lacking the sense of cool and menace, and so on and so forth. However, this is not a commercial and any more intricate, the design would have hindered the focus of this movie, its actors. So i made my peace and resolve to enjoy the movie for what it is. The trailers prepared me for the type of action but I'm surprised they were able to inject elements of humor it.To be honest, i know the movie deviated from its source material and totally transform it into an-all American ensemble. To me, that's artistic license, and the movie and the novel are both different beasts. The producers made a judgment call based on the market and I'm perfectly fine with it. It turned out well, so there.I like the intensity that Cruise brings to his role. It definitely a new turn to have him be a coward, who then redeems himself. We have been too familiar with his action hero persona that this, seems a bit more personal and heartfelt. Cue his zero to hero montage, but wait, its not what we expected. He's making progress but the enormity of it made him give up. Its heart-rending to watch him powers through even when he feels that there's no hope. Then, his developing feelings for Rita, our co-lead makes it all the more harder. Thankfully, her habit in rushing his death cycle, which seems to be her solution for every snag, brings humor to the movie. Emily Blunt, is a revelation, she is believable in the role of renowned war-hero. She once shared Cage's predilections and watching them both try to choreograph and weave order and pattern in an inherently chaotic occasion is entertaining. All in all, i understood the ending and dare i say it, liked the outcome. I'm a sucker for happy endings. The dying omega's blood saves him and rewind it all to the beginning, albeit in the transformed future. He gets to save the world and enjoyed its new and improved future as well. Perhaps with a certain Angel of Verdun...",9,2,4,31 May 2014
Inception," Inception is a poor representation of the dream world - Look elsewhere, this one is too literal and unimaginative.
","UNDERWHELMING, LITERAL AND PRETENTIOUS.. These 3 words pretty much summed up the whole of Inception. Why populate the dream world with the same landscape and tone as the real world? Why the dreamers and their subconscious armed with real-world accessories and firearms? Why must the travel initiated with the actor's pretend sleep? Why does the levels are differentiated with only different decor? (Except the LIMBO realm) WHERE IS THE IMAGINATION? Nolan has the perfect opportunity to execute his wildest imaginations and he messed it up and served us mediocrity. Apparently, he only has the most literal interpretation of dreams. No quirky visual manifestation (mirror-world? top-down switched?), no mystical representation of the subconscious (shadows, shades, animals etc), No difference between dream levels (tones-darker?grayer?more grotesque?), No symbolic representative of weapons ( energy? aura's? light? dark? ). AND OF COURSE, the travel method!NOLAN could've presented a more sophisticated facade. Maybe a dream room with vivid machines powered with mysterious matter. Or for mobility, more visible contraptions for head, neck or body. Then, the transition can be cued with portals, or one's self entering the target's body or....to be more fantastical; the reality bleeds or tears itself into an underworld which is the dream.INSTEAD, what we've got is inferior chase and action set pieces. Save for the gimmicks of collapsing the landscape onto itself, making pathways, the movie's rather bland. It also features too many characters - the forgers, architects, point man, sedative-man, corporate-sponsor man.......you get it. IT SHOULD be anchored by one solid protagonist that's let say have a latent talent for some form of ability (dream-walker but is named with Latin words), his target and the source of his internal conflicts (family, lover, friend).This movie fools layman into thinking that they're smart.IT is basically an inferior imitation of Michael Bay's summer blockbuster disguised as a thinking man's movie. IT'S ABOUT CORPORATE ESPIONAGE - Tell people that and it would be 100% true. CERTAINLY NOT travel between dream worlds....",1,116,237,31 October 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," Disappointing: Nolan's worst movie yet.
","TDKR's 1 billion haul seems to indicate that this blockbuster is a good movie. Think again...its worst of the worst. In fact, it is on par with Bay's explosive-laden monstrosities. You would think that someone who have come up with Momento and Inception would know better... The level of acting, plot and set pieces is indicative of a B-Movie style filmmaking. First off, what's up with Bane's stupid mask and voice. As if, Bale's horrendous voice as Batman is not enough. Can't they be more imaginative? Instead of using voice to indicate that he's the main villain, define that through his actions. He looks just like a garden variety criminal. No trace of his training as a member of the League of Shadows at all. He even fights like a normal bulky, brainless henchman. The fight choreography is laughable. Bane and Batman doesn't square off the way a proponent of deadly martial arts would, instead, they pound on each other incessantly. Where's Yuen Wo Ping when you need 'em?All the while, spouting nonsense whining about how they are superior, being born in the dark etc. In fact, Bane even use a wrestling move as the finisher in their first fight. Wtf?Next item, the dialogue...i can't believe how they gave a straight face while dispensing lines upon lines of utter garbage. Instead of trimming it or transforming it into actual scenes that viewers can enjoy, they stand around saying them, sporting a bewildered look on their face. For instance, Tate @ Talia finishes her monologue by stabbing while Batman shows his O face. I just laugh at this utter absurdity.Should i waste my words any further?TDKR should in fact be a Broadway play or something. There's one suitable scene where thousands of Gotham's finest runs and clashes with Bane's men. No tactics, no strategy, just straight up brawling. Hardware and firearms? That's just for show, these are trained men. We all know that 21st century police and trained mercenaries fights with fists...",1,20,36,16 November 2012
