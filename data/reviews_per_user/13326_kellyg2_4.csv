The Blair Witch Project," Could have been great, but way too short
","This movie definitely has scary moments, but they are too far and few between.  It takes a good hour to really get going, and then before you know it, the credits pop up.  Believe it or not this movie is actually better after you have seen it and thought about the whole thing.  When my husband & I came out of the theater we gave it a 7, but after really thinking about it I'd probably give it an 8, that is compared to other horror movies.  We all know there are few decent horror movies out there, and this is at least a refreshing change.  If you haven't already seen it, it's definitely worth renting at your local video store.",7,0,1,7 October 1999
Taxi Driver," Not all you guys hyped it up to be
","I'm starting to wonder about your reviews here.  I bought this movie due to Imdb's wonderful reviews.  I was let down.  My all time favorite movies correspond with your votes, but this like many others does not. Robert Deniro was awesome as always, but could not help this storyline. This movie is lacking any plot!  The only reason to see this is the love of Deniro, if not save your time and money and skip this one!",6,1,6,23 October 1999
A Clockwork Orange," A little too strange!
","I rented this movie due to IMDb's high appraise of it.  I unfortunately was not impressed. I did not like the plot in the least bit.  Although highly graphic in nature, I was not bothered by that aspect of it.  It just overall sucked.  This is one of the few movies I disagree with the IMDb users about. 5/10.",5,2,6,7 October 1999
The Sixth Sense," A Terrific and Refreshing Change for Horror Movies!!!
","I was a little thrown off when I saw the previews for this movie, but went to see it anyway, despite my better judgement.  I am so glad I did.  This movie is rated #1 on IMDb's favorite horror movies, and I totally agree.  I have seen a lot of horror flicks, but can't think of any that come close to this.  This was such a refreshing change from the typical slasher films which have no plot. I won't give anything away.  If you haven't or do not plan to see this on the big screen, at least rent it on video. 10/10.",Null,0,0,7 October 1999
