The Rock," Best 007 movie.
","Yea, yea, it's just the theory, but the movie is so much more entertaining if you follow the theory that Sean Connery's character is 007.
Other than that this movie has some fantastic music score and great action. The rest of casting is so great too.",8,0,0,14 May 2020
The Devil's Advocate," The Devil is a friend of mine. Or is he?
","Great movie, a bit predictable, but high quality. Basicly all about what happens if you go along side with the Devil.",7,0,1,14 May 2020
Ford v Ferrari," It's alright.
","Surprisingly funny and well acted racing movie. Racing scenes are well done, acting is superb especially by Christian Bale. But other than that, it's long and it feels. I can't say it's spectacular or anything eihter.",5,2,4,10 April 2020
The King's Speech," Pretty boring.
",Pretty boring movie about how a character learns how to break his fear of public speaking.,4,0,3,8 April 2020
Insidious: Chapter 2," Great sequel.
",This sequel's plot does take huge part in being tangled within the first Insidious plot. But it adds a lot of it's own.,7,0,1,14 April 2020
The Lobster," Comedy or a horror movie?
","This is definitely some kind of parody, but the intentions are not clear to me, it is funny, but the style is very horror alike. I liked it, but it was a very weird movie.",6,0,0,1 May 2020
The Avengers," Surprising for it's time, but dated alright only.
","Back in the day every superhero movie had like one or two superheroes per movie. This movie had 5 (more actually, but 5 main) and for it's time fans were mindblown. Nowadays even a standalone hero movie has more than 5 of them.",6,0,3,10 April 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Sooo dissapointing.
","After the first one, this one is so much slowier and it's just so boring. Original had a lot of action and many different styles, this movie pretty much is in one shape and it's pretty slow. Many moments just feel so out of place. I don't buy it that Bride was shot by Budd. In comparision that she did in original it feels as is she's got 10x weaker and stupidier. Also I can't understand the last arc of this film that she gets to the Bill and just stays in the house like nothing. I expected her to kill him right away, I understand that she did not want to kill him near child, but she clearly just stayed there to hang out there.",1,0,0,12 April 2020
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," You've been cheated on people!
","This movie is nothing more but a filler between 2nd and 4th movie and a teaser for 4th movie. I'll admit it was very entertaining to watch because whole time I was hyped that something will happen, but nothing ever happened. This movie does it's job well as a teaser, it creates great hype for 4th movie and that's it. It has no rewatchability value, watching it second time would be torture since you know that nothing happens. Basicly, this is a threatical release of 2h teaser. In other words you just paid to see a teaser. This may be the best teaser I've ever seen, but it's nothing more. It should have been free and released as a promotional video for upcoming 4th movie.",2,2,3,14 April 2020
Black Swan," Abysmal.
","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. This is a terrible rip-off of Mulholland Drive and Perfect Blue. Brings nothing of it's own and does it much much worse. Boring, disgusting and meaningless piece of trash. The only difference of those other movies is the setting, this time it's ballet themed. Here, I spoiled the whole movie of what new it brings, without even spoiling anything plotwise.",1,1,3,8 April 2020
Requiem for a Dream," Drugs are bad kids.
","Overdramatic take on 'why you shouldn't take drugs'. It was interesting, the style was great. Similar to David Lynch's style. It was a fun watch.",7,0,0,14 May 2020
10 Cloverfield Lane," Amazing sequel, but it's not really a sequel.
","This is one of the best thrillers of decade, thrilling and supense. Great characters and story. Well written. Ending was a bit too over the top.",8,0,0,14 April 2020
Source Code," Great thriller
","It's intense thriller with nice time travel concept, what's not to like?",7,0,0,28 April 2020
50 First Dates," So romantic.
","While it is a poor comedy, the immature jokes do set down this movie a bit for what it is - a great romance film. It's not realistic, but the amount of romance it has is just so charming, so well done.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Catch Me If You Can," Smart fast paced drama?
","This was fun. I don't know what else to say, I don't think it's great but I don't have anything bad to say about it either. Anyway I think majority will really enjoy this movie, even tho it's not memorable or anything.",6,1,2,8 April 2020
Deja Vu," Best time travel movie I've seen in a long time.
","This movie is very weird, it starts as a detective movie, but changes genre entirely many times. The plot is quite complex, even the main character had to think to understand it. It's smart, suspense, mindblowing and surprisingly sad. I loved it.",8,0,0,1 May 2020
It," Wow.
","What the hell? It was quite long, very stretched out. In short: Horror scenes are pretty good, actions scenes (yes, action scenes) are great. But damn, this movie is extrememely unrealistic, all this world the characters live in: Children dissapears and nobody cares exept for the kids, crime is happenning and nobody cares exept for the kids, people are dying nobody cares exept for the kids... I just don't buy any of background of the world this movie is set up in.",3,1,2,9 April 2020
Hereditary," Unique, but bland and boring.
","I understand how some people love this, but I don't find it good at all. The plot is something new, but I don't find it much interesting, majority of movie is very boring, I don't like ending at all. The scares are well made, not some cheap jumpscares, but that's all this movie has.",3,0,0,1 May 2020
Training Day," Alright.
","Fun movie for one watching. Very stereotypical, but it didn't ruin it.",6,1,3,1 May 2020
John Wick," Fun action movie.
","Nothing special, but some great mindless action. The action is great in this movie.",7,0,2,10 April 2020
Chinatown," Strong
","This is a serious movie, for the most of it you may sthink nothing interesting is happenning, but ending will make a huge impact.",7,0,0,2 May 2020
A Star Is Born," Interesting, fails at second half.
","The first half was great, the live performance scenes were spectacular. The story turned to crap in second half. Especially the ending, I just don't believe the character could have suicided, felt very out of character. They could have made a sad divorce ending or a motivational ending of him getting out of drinking with the help of wife, but no, they went the way - he suicided...",4,0,0,8 April 2020
Se7en," I don't get it, why so much praise?
","I watched it and it was a very generic detective movie, nothing more. The ending is predictable, when Spacey said 'I have a surprise for you detective' I instantly knew he killed his wife, because what kind of surprise a serial killer can give? Nothing in this movie is more than average. I don't get the praise at all, I guess it's about ending, but I think it sucked.",3,2,7,8 April 2020
Unbreakable," Masterpiece.
","Best superhero movie ever made (tie with Watchmen). This is one of very few realistic takes on superhero genre. The character developement, the mystery, the dialogues - everything's perfect. Now as for MASSIVE SPOILERS: it has the best most genius plot twist ever. So we knew Bruce Willis (The Overseer) was the hero, so who was the villain? The whole movie I was think that Mr. Glass is the only candidate for being a supervillain, since the hero is unbreakable and Mr. Glass is so weak and fragile, I thought it was a logical for him to be villain. So the whole movie I was waiting for Mr. Glass to show up as the villain, and the whole movie came to the end, the story ended and I have lost all my hopes of him being evil. I though, well, this movie doesn't have a main villain, it's interesting. And then the most obvious, predictable plot twist happened. I was shocked, I was so mindblown. It turns out that the best plot twist is then it's the most obvious one. This movie is a masterpiece on all levels. Must watch.",10,1,1,9 April 2020
Fight Club," What is this carp?
","It's quite long and ridiculous. The storyline is stupid. Why did everyone followed an ill man and took all his orders as if he's a god or something? How did nobody ever noticed that he's crazy? How does shooting youself in the mouth kills your alternative personality? Storyline doesn't make any sense. I'll admit this movie is very well directed tho, it has great music, acting and special effects.",2,0,8,8 April 2020
As Good as It Gets," Fantastic romantic comedy.
","The cast was perfect, the chemistry between characters was so natural. The characters were so unique and interesting. This movie was insanely funny, the jokes are top notch and there are dozens of them. Pure awesomeness.",8,0,0,2 May 2020
Monster," Her life story was pretty interesting.
","Charlize Theron was amazing, she nailed it. This movie was interesting, but it could've used some of the footage of real Aileen Wuornos at the end, her interviews and court footage.",6,0,0,14 April 2020
Memento," Genius
","This movie is better than expected. I watched it in the intended chronology and it has some really crazy scenes. I disagree with people saying that it is an extremely confusing movie, if you have any sort of atention span, you can easily put all scenes all together. I suspected that it is only great in this blended chronology so I then watched it in straightforward chronology and it was still a great movie. The only thing I don't like in this movie are some of the protagonist choices.",8,0,0,12 April 2020
Inglourious Basterds," Weird.
","I'll give it that that this movie feels kind of new to ww2 topic. Th acting was superb and plot was interesting. I just can't get the fact that this movie has such a great cast and most of them are killed after a few minutes after they appear in the movie (Til Schweiger, Gedeon Burkhard, Michael Fassbender and many more), such a waste of amazing cast. I wish that bar scene was near the end of movie so you'd have appreaciated the characters more and got more attached to them so all those deaths would be so much more shoking.",6,0,0,12 April 2020
World War Z," Generic zombie movie.
","It was fun, but it's just generic zombie movie with tons of action. Last act of this movie was really disappointing.",5,0,0,14 April 2020
The Hunger Games," Fun, but way too streched out.
","The world in this movie is very interesting, the whole battle royale thing was very well done. Sadly it has poor characters and this movie is too slow for what it should be.",6,1,3,14 April 2020
12 Monkeys," Generic time travel movie.
","I don't get all the fuss. To me this is extremely generic time travel movie, not confusing, straightforward story. Nothing memorable.",4,1,5,9 April 2020
The Impossible," One of the better disaster movies.
",It's a disaster movie which focuses on the family drama more than the disaster itself. It works very well.,7,0,0,7 June 2020
The Notebook," 50/50
","This was a great romance movie with crappy characters. The plot was great, I loved all the present time scenes, those scenes were so wonderful, the ending was so beautiful. I couldn't say the same about the past scenes. Firstly, the guy literraly forced the girl to go on a date with him, she did not like him at first. Secondly, her mother is such a terrible character, forces her quit her boyfriend and hide all his letters, but at the same time she keeps them as if she knew she will show them later on, come on, this is bad writting, it's the same concept as if you rob the bank, but save the money so you could have a chance to possibly give it back to bank later on... Thirdly, the girl is just so unlikable, she can't decide and makes a huge drama until she finnaly decides. To summarise, this could've been a fantastic romance film, but the whole past segment needs to be rewritten.",5,1,2,25 April 2020
Us," Surprisingly good concept and and surprisingly bad plot.
","I loved the concept, the scares, the action was awesome. The twist in mid movie was fantastic. but twist in the end, pretty bad. Anyway as much as good this movie is, it has a huge problem - PLOT HOLES. My man, there's so many, the storyline is so undercooked. A whole clone sociaty underground, how didn't anyone noticed? Why didn't goverment kill the subjects if they had aboundened them or atleast isolated them so nobody could ever find them? Why the girl which was exchanged lost character, shouldn't the tainted one be like tainted and the human one be more like human? Why did the girl stay in the first place? She planned her revenge many years, while she just could've exited the place the same moment she got untangled... There are dozens of other plot holes too, you can read them online, there are articles naming dozens of them... Still, this movie felt like fresh air and it was very entertaining.",7,0,2,9 April 2020
The Danish Girl," Disgusting.
","I have nothing against the transgenders, but this movie make them look gross. The whole story was obnoxious to watch, I can't stand the thing that the male tried female clothes for fun and noticed that he likes wearing them so he kept wearing them, sounds like a huge perversion. It's just so gross. Most of the dialogues later on are so stupid as if protagonist got brain damage. I understand this movie is supposed to make us understand how transgender people feel, but it have done everything the worst way possible, now it feels as if they tried to make us gross of transgenders.By the way, I know a transgender person in real life and his/her story how/why she/he wanted to change gender was very normal and gross at all which makes me question this movie even more.",1,0,6,14 April 2020
Knives Out," Best detective crime mystery movie in a while.
","If you know the genre, you know the whole movie, but that's why it's so great. The movie is truthfull to genre and got it to near perfection. The cast is amazing, all characters are great and actor performances amazing. The mystery is great and so is the plot. Sadly the final plot twist was so overused, it is amazing if you see it for the first time, but I have seen it too many times and predicted it easily. On the good side after that the movie had the perfect ending shot like ever for this genre.",8,1,3,10 April 2020
The Secret in Their Eyes," could have been better.
","It's a movie which focus on both crime and romance, it feels very smashed all together, neither is it a good romance film, neither a great detective movie, but it's alright at being both at the same time.",6,0,0,9 May 2020
The Irishman," Alright gangster flick. Glad to see one of those in these days.
","On one side it is your average gangster movie. Love those or hate it it's up to you. Personally I am not a fan of them. But still, I respect that they made one at all, these are rare nowadays. The cast is great, Joe Pesci was amazing. This movie also involves a friendship between characters, which is great, most relationships in gangster movies are business based. It's really long and wasn't boring at all, but it wasn't anything special eihter.",5,3,8,10 April 2020
Constantine," Horror and action mixure.
","This is a pretty bland movie, too supernatural, too religious for it's own good. One scene it tries to be scary then the other scene it's old-school action.",5,0,0,14 May 2020
The Others," Fantastic.
","Best ghost movie I've seen. The plot is very interesting, it's full of mystery and many shocking twists. It kind of rip-offs some other movies, but I think 'The Others' surpasses all the other ghost movies by a mile.",8,1,1,14 April 2020
Brokeback Mountain," Great, has impact.
","As childish as that sounds it's the best gay movie ever made. Unlike most other gay movies which are slow and nothing happens at all ('Call Me By Your Name'), this one has great writting, deep dialogues and great acting makes this one of the best dramas of 2005.The time this movie is set up in feels very well captured. It doesn't play by cliches. The story is great, you can relate to all the characters, they have many rows in this movie and you understand all their perspectives, it shows how well written it is.",7,0,1,14 April 2020
Orphan," Great until the last part of movie.
","It was interesting look at this plot, there are so many movies with possesed by demons child and similar stuff. This movie gives us a different twist why 'child' is evil. Sadly the movie goes huge downhill after the plot twist, Esther just becomes regular slasher and tries to kill whole family, how lame.",6,0,0,14 April 2020
About Time," Time travel movie which isn't about time travel.
","Such a chaming and beautiful movie. It teaches so much, it shows how we should appreciate our lives more instead of complaining about our past mistakes.The movie is full of plot holes - time travel is absolutely broken, this movie breaks majority of it's own rules, but I will forgive them all, because this movie was meant to be about emotions of the characeters, not time travel itself. So in other words, if you want a sci-fi, this movie will suck, if you want romance, this movie will fullfill your heart.",8,0,0,3 May 2020
Spotlight," Why is this a movie?
","Would have been an interesting documentary, but as a movie it is extremely boring and nothing more. Also it ends at the point there it could get interesting. The movie ends with story being published, but the thing I wished to see was the aftermath of it, but the movie just ends. Extremely boring movie, you could read the whole storyline in 5 min. I don't see why this movie was made in the first place, it gives no emotions, no secrets or anything interesting.",1,1,5,8 April 2020
Insomnia," Fantastic thriller.
","One of the greatest detective movies. Robin William and Al Pacino give yet another amazing performances. It's a bit similar to Death Note, since for the most part they fight more of an intellectual battle than physical one.",8,0,0,14 May 2020
500 Days of Summer," So messed up.
","Once again a great concept ruined. The girl in this movie is so annoying, she use the weird idea of being just 'friends' or something, never getting married etc. Yet at the end she meets a guy for a short time and marries him, she just broke her own rule and she couldn't even explain why.
The chronology of the movie is messed up too, It is pretty much random, because of that it spoils the ending very soon, it should have been in normal chronological order.
The only thing I like about this movie is the poor protagonist who has to deal with this weird girl.",3,1,2,28 April 2020
Midnight in Paris," Unique and interesting film.
","A very subtle, beautiful and quite slow romance movie about time travel. It's not memorable, yet you'll always remember it, it's very cute and heartwarming. Give it a watch with your partner at midnight, you may fall in love with this movie.",8,1,1,9 April 2020
Zodiac," Misleading advertisement.
","Just listen me out, this is a great mystery film. But it is a terrible thriller. Everyone who watched this film said it was 'amazing thriller' and if you google best thrillers of all time you will probably get this movie as a result. Why is it called a thriller??? The movie was extremely slow and long, there were no suspense or thrills which are the thriller deifining things. People have no idea what a thriller is they think that a detective/crime/mystery/thriller are one and the same... Even on IMDb page this movie is described as Crime, Drama, Mystery, see? No thriller...
Anyway because I was mislead, I was hoping to see a great thriller as everyone told me, but I was bored to death. To be honest I think this movie would've been much more entertaining as a documentary other than a live-action film. Anyway, giving it one star is obviously unfair, since it's a great mystery film, but as a thriller it's abysmal, so blame the fans for misleading me. You may think, so why I don't rate it as a mystery film then? That's because I have seen it once and that experience was terrible, I rate the experience.",1,2,4,22 April 2020
The Prestige," What the hell was it?
","It was very entertaining and ending is shocking. But if you look at this movie deeper it is extremely stupid and illogical. 1. Using cloning machine for revenge is insanely stupid, how could Tesla approved of this is ununderstandable. They could've used it for science you know... 2. The whole movie I was wondering why did Christian Bale play two characters in this movie, appears one supposed to be masked and you don't know it's Bale, too bad I instantly knew it, the makeup department did a terrible job at masking him. 3. The ending is so stupid, I loved it at first even through I knew there were two Bales I was shocked they were twins since I could not ecpect it to be that cheap... I'm too lazy to complain of how stupid it is. But in short in real life ending would have not worked at all. 4. Also how was Bale sentenced for murder if Hugh Jackman (the one he murdered) kept doing his shows and also how nobody ever found those dead bodies anywhere? You can't just simply hide hundreds of dead clones without anyone noticing even if he paid someone to hide them, I believe he would've been betrayed as getting hands on cloning machine is much more valuable than money and also you could make much more money from it anyway. Overall as much as thrilling and gripping this movie is, the storyline is full of plot holes and lacks logic everythere.",4,1,4,8 April 2020
Cloverfield," Interesting.
","The action was so good in this movie, I was surprised. Sadly, it has this found footage camera style, so it ruins everything.",5,0,0,14 April 2020
Hotel Rwanda," Strong drama.
","It tells you the events of Rwandan genocide, not many people knows what happened there. I think this movie is a good presentation of the event in an art form instead of documentary. I loved it, it's full of emotion, shows many sad truths about how United Nations work and a lot more.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
The Hateful Eight," One of the better Tarantino movies.
","I love the second half of movie, so much suspense, great dialogues and lots of violence. On the other hand first half was so slow and so boring, pretty much nothing happened, I swear almost everything were not needed in the first place, I'd easily cut majority of first half.",7,0,1,12 April 2020
We Were Soldiers," Respect the ones who died in war.
","This film is truly paying respect to those who died in war. It not only centers on the war, but at the soldiers and their families as well, it's a very emotional war movie. One of the best.",8,0,0,21 May 2020
The Bodyguard," Mediocre movie in a nice clothes.
","This film is quite good I guess, but not too much. It's a story there body guard falls in love with the one he protects. He is arrogant and the girl is spoiled. This whole story is so cliche, the reason it's somewhat good is because of the great cast and fantastic music.",6,0,0,22 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Best Star Wars movie.

The Town," Meh.
","Some fun bank heist movie, that's about it. Nothing bad, but nothing remarkable.",5,2,2,1 May 2020
Taxi Driver," Worst character developement movie ever.
","This movie is supposed to be character study, but I see no events which would normally lead the protagonist to his changes. The character developement just seems very random to me, unrealistic. With movies like The Godfather and American History X this one is super weak.",3,2,6,12 April 2020
Shutter Island," I mean the ending is kind of cool, but how many times have this been done before?
","I have seen movie with this plot so many times. This one is just another presantation of it, the ending was very well put in this one, but it doesn't offer anything new. Also ending 'erases' whole movie progress, so it's kind of worthless to watch since 'nothing' really happened.",3,1,3,12 April 2020
Life of Pi," Beautiful, but nothing truly interesting.
","This movie goes for art and stuff, the cinematography, the colour pallete it's nice looking. Sadly this movie lacks realism on all fronts. More like fairytale.",5,0,1,14 April 2020
Lost in Translation," Generic character study film.
","Yea, the idea is great. It's about loniness and boredom. Two characters bored of their life meet each another and notice how much in common they have.This movie is nothing special, tho I'll admit it is quite genius that it takes in place in Japan, since the language is different and so is the culture, characters always misunderstand what Japanese say and feel awkward with their culture.",6,1,2,15 April 2020
Forrest Gump," There are much better life movies.
","Forrest Gump may be fun to watch, but there is nothing special about it. It's just another life movie, it shows the culture of the time eras, it shows some historical events in the backgrounds which is cool, but main story is just the average life.",5,0,1,9 May 2020
Gone Baby Gone," Haven't seen such bland detective movie in a while.
","Very poor detective movie, also if being mediocre wasn't bad enough, in the ending protagonist makes such a terrible choice you will dislike this movie forever.",2,0,3,1 May 2020
American Hustle," To be honest, it's a quite simple movie.
","I was really hyped for this, people told me how smart it was and stuff. I watched it and while entertaining, it captured the time era greatly and had great cast, the story was simple, not confusing or much interesting at all. I'm sure this movie will be forgotten in time (actually, it already is).",6,0,0,22 April 2020
Rush," Dissapointing quality.
","I loved the chemistry between the racers. But racing is so dissapointing. It's based on real events which has real footage. Yet they CGI the car crashes, which do not look too good. The thing is they could've used the real footage and it would have been amazing.",5,0,6,10 April 2020
Bird Box," Just another simple horror story in a new body.
","At first this movie looked very unique and mysterious, I was very invested in story, I thought it will lead to a great plot twist or anything. Turns out it's just another simple horror movie, just 'monster' is in a new body.",4,3,4,9 April 2020
Baby Driver," Purely for fun.
","It's quite a dumb movie and that's the point. The cool action, great music, colourful color pallete and cheesy romance, guarantee a good time.",7,1,2,8 June 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," So boring.

",I'm pretty sure the security would have been much better in that base. Also how does an eye colour can be a factor for cure from zombie virus.,4,1,1,14 April 2020
Cast Away," Best stranded movie.
","This movie is very emotional, it's not as much about the survival in a remote island as it is about the emotions the protagonist feels. It's a great drama, Tom Hanks was fantastic. It's a bit weird that the ending is left to interpretation, but I like it.",8,0,0,2 May 2020
The Village," Interesting.
","The movie changes genre near the end for a few shocking plot twists. I loved them, but it raises so many questions. Anyway, I do recommend to experience this movie yourself, make your own mind about it.",6,1,1,9 April 2020
Split," Pretty stupid?
","I liked it as a thriller, but seriously, the girls had so many oppurtunities to escape. When the Horde got into the kid mode, they could've easily killed him. It's also weird that protagonist fell in love with him. Ending twist is so 50/50. I would have probably loved it, but I hadn't sadly seen Unbreakable at the time... So I just asked, why did Bruce Willis had a cameo at the end.
Also the movie shows only around 8 personalities of him while there are 24 in total. I wish all of them had a role in the movie.",5,0,2,9 April 2020
American Psycho," It was stupid.
","You may think it's smart (your choice), but it's just a mindless movie about a serial killer, his character study isn't great and ending is dump, people say that the ending is game changer, but it's not it's just a cheap way to confuse the plot for you.",3,3,7,22 April 2020
The Shining," Great, but gets worse with each viewing.
","I used to love this movie, I used to see it like others see it. But over time it got worse. While acting, editing and cinematography are top notch, sometimes this movie feels a bit cheap and also not much happens in it. I like the ending in the book a lot more, since they changed the ending completely I wish they changed the character roles too. I wish Jack turned good at the end or even better what if Jack turned good, but the mother went evil. Nowadays I just feel I would've altered a lot in this movie.",7,0,0,1 May 2020

The Patriot," Braveheart 2.0
","If you loved Braveheart you'd probably love this. Firstly, it stars the same actor. Secondly, it's very similar storyline - A man fights a war for freedom and for revenge. The cinematography, action and music is as fantastic. To be honest, this exacly the same movie, just set in a different time period. I love everything about it. It's full of action, great acting, great drama, great characters and fantastic story. 3 hours of pure entertainment.",8,1,1,21 May 2020
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Fincher ruins it. Watch original instead.
","As you'd expect the american remake of Swedish movie is terrible. Same plot, majority of movie is shot to shot remake. The parts he changed are changed completely and they are much worse, of course. Acting is not bad, but actors in original were amazing, makes acting in this one not so good.

To me The Machinist is the weakest adabtation of this concept I have yet seen, on the other hand it may be the first of it's kind (I don't remember any movie who came before this, but I have suspition this wasn't the original idea to begin with). Anyway even if it was the original movie, the rip-off/inspired ones were much better than this (I won't name any of those better ones, since it would completely spoil the whole plot of them including ending, cause they have pretty much same plot duh...).",2,2,5,22 April 2020

Jokes are kindergarden level, even 1st graders make better jokes than Marvel. They made Thor fat, ruined character possibly forever. And he was playing FORTNITE, out of all games they had to make Thor a filthy casual, I wish they used some obscure game instead so some nerds could have been pleased, instead of kids. I'll admit action scenes were great, but majority of characters were so underused, many of them got only 3 seconds of footage for whole battle. Whole movie is centered on few characters only.

Room," Boring and wasted potential.
","The 1/3 of movie focuses on a trapped family which tries to escape from a tiny house. They are locked by a keypad. The fact that the mother doesn't try to guess the combination of the lock in the time when the man is gone is just so dump. Even if he regulary changed the combination, she could've atleast looked at his hand movements, so you would have the idea which numvber he presses. She also could've made something sharper in her time which could cut the skin and she could've tried to cut his throat. Obviously logic wasn't the point of the movie. It was the emotional message... The family escapes after 1/3 of the movie and the rest of it are the boy's learning of the new world, which he doesn't do at all. He somehow lives an oridinary life as if nothing had happened. I mean nothing surprises him, he interacts with stuff as any other kid. His mother is also completely fine, they live as if nothing happened, they were trapped for many years you know. Oh and her parents also couldn't be more unrealistic, they don't even get surprised they found their lost daughter. This movie is pure garbage, it tries to go for emotional message instead of plot, but they had no idea how to make human emotions look real. Even The Room (2003) was better on plot and more emotional, that's saying something.",1,0,2,11 May 2020

Mulholland Drive," As a huge fan of Lynch I'm quite disappointed. But it's not Lynch's fault, it's the fans...
","This movie is just another take on the plot of Perfect Blue. You may argue it's absolutely nothing alike and you're right, but base formula is the same. Anyway, MUlholland Drive has many great scenes and many interesting twists, but it's too confusing for its own good and sometimes plain cheap. This movie has lesbian sex scenes, clearly made just to get the stupid virgins' atention, so cheap and disgusting. Half of the reviews who rate this movie 10/10 only mentions the sex scenes in their reviews, the most of other half says they love it, but don't understand movie at all, it just shows that this film does not deserve most of it's praise. Lynch obviously did it on purpose to manipulate the stupid, so he's the genius. Only the very few actually paid attention to this mess and know what really happened. Anyway if you go through this mess scene by scene you'll notice many Lynch's genius subtle details and filmmaking, but the problem is the chronology, after 2/3 of movie it becomes so blended, that most viewers had no idea what they saw. If you don't understand what happenned, LondonCityGirl (youtube channel) did a great explanation video on it, she says all you need to know. Anyway while the plot is quite good, it's as I mentioned before just another Perfect Blue plot's version. The other of this movie's biggest flaws is that it is too much based on interpretations, most I love, but some not so much. To summary, this is a quality film for most part, but the lesbian scenes, way too blended chronology and the overusage of interpretations makes this Lynch's weakest film.",3,1,5,14 April 2020

Groundhog Day," Time travel movie, but it's not about time travel.
","Groundhog day is a special film. It is so cute and charming.Short summary of plot - the story is about a news reporter who hates his job and is easily annoyed by everything. Every year he comes to this one small town and makes a report on Groundhog Day, he hates doing it all his heart. One year something different happens, he does the report on Groundhog Day as ussual, but after the day ends, it restarts. He has to repeat the same day all over again. And this happens again and again and again and again, he is in infinite loop, which he can't escape.As simple as the plot is, the character make this movie iconic. Protagonist tries pretty much everything what you'd want him to try, he even has some interesting ideas I could've never thought of. With the rest of other amazing character this movie generates a lot of fun stories what can happen just in 1 day. But this movie is not about fun stories eihter, it's about character developement. Protagonist learns a lot in this movie and his character has drastic changes, but all is so well made, you don't notice the progress or sudden changes, because it feels so natural. Oh and guess what this movie is also very funny and has a great romance too. I can't describe what this movie doesn't do, it's just perfect.",10,0,0,15 April 2020

Joker," Ruined Joker character forever.
","Firstly, I think Joker is one of the best villains ever made. Anyway, the thing is I have seen many versions of him, I have read a bit of comics, watched some movies and some episodes of animated series. I think The Dark Knight is it's best version, but I do like many others too EXEPT FOR THIS ONE. It feels like a random character just chosen to be 'Joker' it feels like a cash grab on the name. He is such a loser, blaims everyone else for his own mistakes, as stupid as he could be, he is easily fooled. I understand he is mentally ill, but he is nothing like the other Joker versions. Why do people love him so much? He kills a few people and instantly has thousands of followers, imagine real life killers get that lucky. Also why is Batman a kid while Joker is in his 40s/50s, when Batman will grow up Joker will be about 70 years old... Besides that the first half of movie is extremely boring, but I'll admit the second half is pretty awesome, many scenes were great. To summarise, it shouldn't have been called 'Joker', it should have been a movie about another clown not 'Joker', in that case it could have been pretty cool I guess. Now it is a cheap cash-grab.",4,3,10,10 April 2020

Downfall," I want to like it, but it's just boring.
","I am a huge fan of history of Hitler, yes, he was evil, but just because he done dozens of evil things, doesn't mean he didn't do anything good and that's what many people ignore to see. He promoted a healthy life, he didn't smoke, he was an animal lover, he was a vegetarian, he wrote some interesting books, he promoted science, if Hitler would've won ww2 we may have a much better technology today.As for the movie itself, it shows the last moments of hitler's life. I love that they didn't show what happened the last minuted as in the history books, we can't know for sure, because nobody saw it. I love how well they portrayed Hitler, they showed clues of parkinson.

","I wasn't a fan of first It. This movie is actually better, yea, I said it. It is actually a very entertaining, funny comedy and some scares were very good, on the other hand it's almost 3h long. The last hour really felt it was extremely stretched out. Some of the charcaters I liked, some I did not. As for first two hours I'd say this is a decent horror comedy, but last hour went downhill. The final boss fight was so long that they gave characters a break, yea they were safe for a few minutes and could talk freely, the Pennywise was supposedly to big to get in even through he could have easily shrink. Also the epilogue for this movie tried to give us a deeper meaning to whole thing, but why? It is a horror movie, not a drama, why is it being moralised at the end? I feel as if the creators tried to make many genres into one, but it doesn't work too well.",4,1,1,9 April 2020

The storyline is quite complex, full of twists. This movie has awesome special effects. It is one of the better sci-fi movies out there. By the way, the ending is supposed to be a ambigous ending, but am I the only one who thinks it is obvious? There was a scene there he tested the spinning thing and it fell, he later went 4 dreams deep in and later 4 dreams out, so isn't it obvious that it is real life?",8,2,3,8 April 2020

Arrival," Worst Sci-Fi of all time.
","I haven't seen such a poor plot Sci-fi like ever. Even Star Wars movies are better Sci-Fi than this. Anyway, the whole movie tells a story of aliens who came to earth to give the 'gift' of how to see future. The aliens can't talk our langue, but they do have their language of signs. The protagonist learns their language in time and somehow this makes her see future. Anyway the goverments want bomb the aliens, so protagonist stops them, she simply says something to war general which only he knows, but she only learns this by seing the future. It wouldn't ever happened unless she knew the future, which makes it a paradox, a very bad one, this is the worst cliche plot hole a time travel movie can make, so obviously this is a bad time travel movie. Also the whole movie protagonist sees future events 1. without firstly even knowing the language 2. At the end of movie it's supposed to be a plot twist (You were supposed to think it those were memories) but since those 'memories' showed a child and a romance with the dude which she obviously during the film met for the first time and the fact that the child was never brought up to the plot or conversations in any way makes it was obvious that those 'memories' were future seeing.Anyway this movie fails at everything, the characters are weak, whole movie is slow and boring and plot is so full of plot holes that this movie doesn't even deserve to be called a Science Fiction. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.",1,1,7,14 April 2020

I don't like the ending tho, I think father went a bit out of character, I don't buy it that he would have stabbed the rich man, I understand why he did that, but it's not enough for this character to do such drastic moves. I also dislike that son survived, but daughter died, by their wounds, I would've prefered opposite.",8,1,4,10 April 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Nice style movie, but not much more.
","I love this movie's style all the camera work and some smart dialogues, the ending is great and it does have some funny and great scenes. But overall plot is pretty poor and beside the great scenes it is quite boring.",5,0,2,8 April 2020
The Conjuring," Just another haunted house movie.
","I don't see anything special, in fact some scares are ridiculous instead of scary (hand clap).",3,1,1,14 April 2020
Marriage Story," It has fantastic acting, but does it do anything else?
","Hard to rate this one. On one side I liked it, it was entertaining and Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson gave amazing performances, but the characters they play are really flawed. Some of their decisions lack further thinking. I do like Charlie more, but they both make terrible mistakes. I haven't heard of such divorce story in real life like ever, yet many say it's very realistic. Maybe it is realistic in USA, but in Europe it's not. IDK, I think this movie tries too hard to be sad and dramatic and lacks realistic character choices. Kramer vs Kramer has exact same plot yet is much more entertaining and sad and characters are much more believable.",6,1,3,8 April 2020
1408," Interesting, but could've been better.
","The concept is great, the main character tries to escape the room, but no matter what he can't escape it. At the end he decided to burn it. The thing is we supposed to believe that enyone who gets inside the room sooner or later becomes crazy, no reason why, exept maybe for the fact that it is haunted? I would've prefered a huge plot twist at the end of some sort why the people are getting crazy or maybe why they aren't.",6,0,0,14 April 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," Fantastic character in a mediocre story.
","Hannibal Lecter is one of the best horror villains ever, he's smart, creepy and full of surprises. Sadly, the story he's in is pretty bland. Red Dragon is the best Hannibal movie.",6,0,0,14 May 2020
Mother!," Interesting, but nothing more than interpretations.
","I thought this was a mystery, confusing, psychological movie, but it turns out it's just another presentation of biblical things just in a new way. I do think this is a nice adaptation since it combines many stories into one and feels as a completely new story.",6,1,3,9 April 2020
Trainspotting," Weird.
","Drugs are bad kids, this movie shows all the 'fun' and disturbing things what can happen from doing drugs. It's mindless, crazy and over-the-top movie. The ending, was surprisingly deep though.",6,1,2,9 May 2020
Signs," Interesting.
","It was a great mysterious movie, ending felt weak, like as it's sequel bait or something. Firstly people say the 'plot twist' is horrible, to be honest I don't count it as plot twist at all. How is enemy's weakness a plotwist? Secondly why is stupid? I don't understand why are people saying it's stupid. They say the aliens would have never attacked the earth since it's based on water - their weakness. I mean, did humans knew what's the difference on the moon before landing on it? Nope, yet they still landed on it, so how should have aliens knew the water is dangerous if they never got into any contact with it in the first place? I don't think they had great technology, I don't think those aliens were scientists or anything, just because they had spaceships does not mean they could test stuff in distance. Damn you people try to look smart, yet not fully thinking it through.",6,0,1,9 April 2020
Identity," New turn on mystery genre?
","It's a great mystery movie, great characters and great plot. Movie's mystery is top notch, characters have no idea what's happenning so does the viewer, so you'll alway be invested for more clues. The ending is shocking, obvious yet genius.",8,0,1,14 April 2020
Speed," Good, but lacking.
","Speed is all about speed, that's all the action you're going to get. It could've used some good car chases.",6,0,1,14 May 2020
Amélie," Very forgettable romance flick.
","I loved the style of it. This film is very colourful, the editing is interesting, the music and camera work is great.
For the story I'm not too fond. The protagonist girl is playing with other characters, to some she sets traps, to some she plays with their feelings and minds, to some he gives clues and mystery. It's all a game for her.
I wouldn't call this a romance movie at all, more like bland adventure movie.",6,0,1,14 May 2020
The Sixth Sense," Meaningful, but damn those PLOT HOLES.
","I love what this movie tries to achieve, it has many very sad scenes which made me cry. It is a really great drama with horror elements. But story doesn't make much sense. Firstly the plot twist was so predictable, the scene in the restaurant was so obvious that I can't imagine not being spoiled the twist by watching it. So, obviosuly all questions are: How didn't Bruce Willis notice he is dead before, like his wife never responded to him, nobody exept for boy ever talked to him. Also who hired him to check the boy in the first place, he was dead for quite some time. Also if the door he couldn't opened was barried for so long, how come he never asked his wife why is it locked? Nothing truly makes sense in this movie about Bruce Willis character.",6,0,1,9 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Abysmal.
","Same stuff once again. Also, kills off one of the best characters in the franchise like nothing. Full of annoying new characters. Also, Rey is powerful out of nowhere while others had to train to become powerful.",1,23,25,10 April 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Horrible
","Extremely boring and long movie with poor storyline. What is wrong with ending? It felt like 4 endings put together one after one, I swear he made 4 different endings and put them all in this movie. The action and special effects were great tho.",3,2,7,8 April 2020
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Streched out as the first one.
","This movie is way too slow for what it supposed to be. It has interesting world, but majority of playtime is based on those poorly written characters.",5,1,3,14 April 2020
The Matrix," Best Sci-Fi movie ever made!
","The plot is genius, it's so smart you can even apply it to real life, I don't believe in Matrix, but I love that you can believe in it and it makes sense. Also surprisingly for a Sci-Fi movie, it not only goes for the plot, it also goes for action and holy crap the action is really awesome, just amazing in this movie. I can even say it's one of the best action movies ever made. This movie had many very unique at the time and memorable moments which were parodied and ripped-off by hundreds of movies like Bullet-Time for example. Masterpiece.",10,0,0,8 April 2020
Looper," Nice time travel movie.
",It's a simple time travel movie which shines as being a good thriller.,6,0,1,28 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," dated like s**t.
","It was a legendary movie back then I guess. I watched it recently, it was so boring. It's so slow takes half the movie to get somethere. The action aged badly. It has the worst lightsaber fight ever - Obi-Wan Kenobi vs Darth Vader. Just look at it, they barely move, they fight so slow. It's so horrible, funny thing is they could've done much better with no budget, just sway lightsabers faster... After heroes escape the movie gets worse, the rest is in spaceship and even while it's action it's boring.",2,1,10,10 April 2020

Click," It's not a comedy.
","This movie plays like a comedy, does some crappy jokes, which takes this movie down a bit from what it really is - a great drama. It has amazing character development it shows us why family is important. It's a great drama for whole family.",8,1,1,9 May 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," A sequel was what I expected.
",Just like original the action is great and the movie is pretty mindless fun.,7,1,1,10 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Better than episode 4 one.
","After terrible first (4th movie) this comes at a surprise, it has much better action scenes and interesting ending. It's not a spectacular movie, but fun can be had with this one.",5,0,8,8 April 2020
The Cabin in the Woods," Wasted opportunity.
","This film is a parody of your average horror slashers. Th whole concept of people faking cabin in the wood killing with real monster just to please gods is interesting, sadly it could have been so much better. I wish the movie didn't end at the moment it did end. It would've been so much interesting if the monsters were free and got into big cities.",4,0,0,18 June 2020
True Romance," Great, but lacks.
","It's a fun adventure action comedy. As for romance part it's not your stereotypical romance. It's weird to see a mixure between crazy and romantic, I think it nails it pretty well, still it could have been more than a fun movie.",7,0,1,10 April 2020
Her," Pathetic?
","Is this is where humanity is going to? It's disgusting, this movie shows how pathetic humans are becoming. Too pathetic find a real person to love, so instead falls in love with a computer A.I.... On one hand this movie is important, cause it shows the possible future of the upcoming terrible generations of our children, on the other hand I can't watch how pathetic and miserable the humanity in this movie is.",4,1,7,8 April 2020
Slumdog Millionaire," How hard life can be if you are poor in India?
","It's a great movie showing us how hard can a life be in India. Very harsh and with great music this movie is not only entertaining, but shows Indian culture too. It also try to give us friendship and love values, but I don't think they work very well, I like this movie more as a story about character's life and his adventures.",8,0,0,8 April 2020
Gladiator," Braveheart rip-off
","It's a really good movie, but it borrows so much from Braveheart (and many other epics made before) it's almost the same movie once again. Great villain, great hero, great story, great action and amazing soundtrack - all these things make it a great epic.In my opinion it's unfairly rated. Don't misunderstand me, it's NOT overrated, but 8.5 imdb is way too much. I don't mind it having this big imdb, but movies it rips-off which also are also much better are rated lower (for example Braveheart 8.3, Ben-Hur 8.1).",8,0,4,21 September 2019
Donnie Darko," Hilariosity!
","Oh my, this movie is so bad I love it. The first time I watched (standart edition) it in 2010 I think, it was so boring and plot was so bad, the ending of Donnie dying was so insulting. So I thought I'll give it another try , the second time I watched a few weeks ago (director's cut) and it was so funny, so ridiculous that I loved it.The characters: you get some really funny people here. Donnie Darko is a bit of rebel, he's rude, smart and has some mental problems, he SEES DEAD PEOPLE (oh, wait wrong movie? Or is it?) Anyway his friends are as stupid as they can be. And bullies, oh my, the bullies are the best with their dialogue 'I like your boobs', how could you not laugh from this. Most characters have really funny lines like 'You're b*tchy, but not a b*tch' or 'I think you're an antichrist'. This is one of the best unintentional comedies I've seen.The plot is the best part of the movie, to be honest I see how fans think it's smart, but to me it's just so bad it's good. The last part of movie went so over the top, the bullies showed up out of nowhere, the deaths of characters were so funny, like the way how Donnie's girlfriend died, because Donnie sent a letter to Grandma Death or the thing that Bunny just showed up in the movie for the first time (as a real person) just to die instantly to be sent to help Donnie in the alternative universe's past, it's so funny. I love the whole Donnie being a superhero concept, but obviously the whole time travel thing was so bad that at the end Donnie suicided, yes suicided, he knew what's going to happen, he could've just walked away, but he stayed and laughed the whole time. He clearly laughed of how bad this film is.Background details: one of the best thing about the plot is that in the background there are a bit more happenning then you may think. For example one of the goverment guys is spying on Donnie the whole movie, you can see him in background of some scenes, this is genius.Verdict: Donnie Darko is a mess. If you think it's awesome it's your choice, and I understand why. But for me this movie is just so ridiculous, it was so bad and funny that I put it in the same place as Tommy Wiseau's 'The Room' (2003)",3,0,1,14 April 2020

Atonement," It's something I guess, but not what I'd like.
