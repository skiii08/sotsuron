3:10 to Yuma," Coulda been a 9 or 10 but...
","Wow. Wade starts off as one of the best villains ever. But then at the end he inexplicably helps the guys who are after him. He shoots his own, extremely loyal men. He grows a heart, apparently, out of the blue. Out of character. When a guy does something out of character at the end of a film, it's because the writer needed a lazy way to tie things up. A prime example here. Horribly unrealistic change of heart for Wade.",5,2,6,22 December 2018
Minority Report," What a sell-out ending
","Max Von Sydow is smart enough to come up with the crime of the century...imagine all the years of work that must have gone into planning the murder of Ann Lively so that the psychics would be fooled.  Imagine how complicated (and brilliant) his plan was to ruin and frame Tom Cruise.  When he shoots the FBI guy, he got away with it because he did so while the psychics were not functioning.  He is a criminal genius who plans and details his murders oh so precisely.  He's kept his mouth shut all these years and then at the ending...when Spielberg cannot come up with anything better...Von Sydow accidentally makes a slip of the tongue and mentions the drowning.  This is such a simple, cliched way to 'catch' a bad guy and has been done a million times.  Such unoriginaility.  He basically confessed. We're led to believe how smart he's been for years and years, and then Spielberg wants us to believe that he would just come out and be so stupid as to reveal his knowledge of the drowning.  Terrible, terrible writing.",5,1,2,24 June 2002
Knives Out," Don't worry. It's all explained for you in the end...
","...and his explanation lasts over half an hour!!
In case you weren't sure whodunnit, and why, Detective Daniel Craig explains it for you in the end. In detail. In loooong detail. The final scene where'd he recaps and summarizes it all for the audience lasts over half an hour!!",5,2,4,26 February 2020
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Great Acting, Unrealistic Plot
","I was glad that not every review here gave this 10 stars and that several reviews pointed out the absurd, giant plot holes. After about an hour, you start to lose track of all the felonies that Frances and Sam commit (and get away with Scott free). My favorite is when the 3 billboards were set afire, but then only the paper was burned and the rickety old rotted-wood frames remained in great shape.
I get that love and desperation make a mother do crazy things, but drilling into a doctor, kicking children in the crotch, firebombing a police station four times, etc., was simply too far-fetched.
But my favorite peeve is with Woody. The loving father. He commits suicide, so his family will now get Zero life insurance. And to make it worse, he takes his last $5,000 and instead of leaving it to his two adorable girls, he gives it to the local troublemaker. Now THAT is a man who has his priorities straight!",6,5,7,12 March 2018
The Usual Suspects," Most Overrated film of all time
","The Usual Suspects is one of those movies that you expect to be good because all your fiends say it's good.  People are afraid to say how lousy this is, because their friends will get on them.  But I will say it.  #1, Stephen Baldwin is in it...so how good can it be?  #2 Kevin Spacey is a criminal. He lies to the police and makes up a story to cover his own butt.  The cops have busted him, and instead of confessing, he makes up a lie about the Kaiser.  This movie is considered original? A criminal lies to the police?? THAT is so original?  It happens every single day, people!!!  I can't believe so many people like this movie.  It's about a crook who lies to the cops...like there's something original or shocking about that.  Think about it.  Do you really like this movie because of Stephen Baldwin and a man telling a lie, or do you like it because you know you're supposed to like it...",1,38,73,8 January 2004
The Favourite," Coulda been a 10 with an ending...
","A good ending would have been great. A bad ending would have been acceptable. But to have no ending at all, with virtually nothing wrapped up? Ridiculous. Look, I get the idea that sometimes bad people win. Emma stone won. Sorta kinda. We're not quite sure.
Lady Sarah is banished, but you get the sense that some day, she'll figure out a way to get one of her letters through. After all, you end up rooting for her. You want her messages to get to the Queen, and you want the Queen to wisen up and realize that Emma is a lying scoundrel.
But we the audience get none of that. the writers obviously couldn't think of a satisfactory ending, so they came up with the old, 'Let's just leave things where they are for now, and call it a day, mid-plot.'",7,1,2,16 January 2019
Mulholland Drive," 2 types...
","There are 2 kinds of people who can understand this movie: Liars and liars. People writing these reviews are too ashamed to admit that they have no clue what the hell happens in the last half hour, so they come up with all sorts of hypotheses.  Do YOU really want to guess about the ending of a movie?  I don't.  I was treated to some interesting characters and a witty mystery for 2 hours, and then they all just disappeared and were replaced by guessing games.  People like this movie only cuz they think it's 'cool' to like Lynch.",Null,1,2,1 September 2003
Signs," What the...? Why did...?
","The director tries to make a name for himself with a deep message about lack of faith and fancy visual images, but he leaves out major plot elements that make ZERO sense once you think about it. For one, the aliens had been in/around Mel's home for a few days.  they bother his dogs and bend over his crops and jump on his roof, but for the most part (at first) they are not deadly.  Then all of a sudden, out of the blue, Mel realizes that one night the aliens will come to kill him.  He is right to barricade his family in his house, but how did he know an alien attack was coming THAT particualr night, when the aliens previously had been there for several peaceful nights? Joaquin lives in the guest house behind the main house.  Why would his prized baseball bat and trophies be in his brother's house and not his own? When they notice the alien is hurt by water, why don't they all just take the 50 million glasses of water laying around and douse him? Junk junk junk.",5,1,1,8 August 2002
Identity," Spoilers....
","Spoiler:   This whole damn movie was a spoiler, as in, it spoiled my weekend.  What a crappy joke.  Everything you see...all the suspense, all the murders, all the whodunnit mystery...it ALL ends up being just in the mind of some fatass psycho patient.  All the stuff you see was just going on in the guy's mind.  I can't believe people are writing in saying that the 'killer' was a surprise to them.  Hello....there was no killer!  There were no deaths.",3,1,5,5 May 2003
