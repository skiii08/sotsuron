The Mask," JWB's Mask Review
","Ahh The Mask... One of my favorite movies from my childhood along with Jurassic Park... I use to own this movie on VHS but now I own it on Blu-Ray... But It has a very interesting history, Back in the 80's The Mask was nothing more then a Twisted Horror Comic published by Dark Horse Comics (No surprise really Dark Horse are always publishing some Dark stuff, But they have done some good stories like Aliens Vs Predator, Indiana Jones, Star Wars and some James Bond comics, But these days they've been publishing some Interesting stuff lie Anime and Manga based comics, Isn't that right, Mark Crilley? the man who did Brody's Ghost.) But then New Line Cinema brought the rights to the comic to make a series of films, in order to recreate the success of the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise the same horror franchise that put New Line on the map... Thank You Freddy Krueger for making this possible. Freddy Krueger: It's no problem Mr Barker, I also advised New Line to let Warner Bros. Entertainment by New Line to save us from bankruptcy... How ever When WB did a Remake of My movie, It didn't go the way they wanted.JWB: I'll be sure to check it out along with your film series and Freddy vs. Jason, Back then when people first heard they where making a movie of this Green Face, Some of them where like 'There is no way this is ever gonna work!' Not only was the old comics Demented, Cruel and sick, But the Comic Book movie of the mid 90s where really crap at the time, Like Spawn, Batman & Robin, STEEL and Tank Girls, But when this movie was finally released, People where very very VERY surprised that Not only did the Movie barely resemble the comic but it was damn good for a change making it one of them weird rare exceptions of a movie adaptations the doesn't follow the original source material and is better for it Which explains why there are movies out there that are deviating from the original source material, Reasons why they did this change is to make it more appealing to everyone.I've watched this movie in the past and to this day, And clips of it in a Mexican hang out called the Coco Bongo like in the movie... hmm guess I now know where that idea came from. I really like this movie, Sure the effects might be cheesy a bit, But that is was makes this movie stand out among the bad ones in the past... Jim Carrey is perfect in this movie yeah he did Ace Ventura and he was The Riddler from Batman Forever...But the lest I hear about it's stand-Alone Sequel Son of the Mask, the better, For it was already covered by the Blockbuster Buster and the Nostalgia Critic with very questionable results... A big Horrific Let down to the Mask Franchise, If someone tries to do another sequel... Please let it be a Direct and proper sequel to the first Mask movie.",9,4,4,24 August 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," JWB's Batman V Superman Review
","Hi everybody, We all know of the Batman movies and Superman movies, Some where good others where bad, But wonder what might happen when These two heroes meet in one movie? THEY DUKE IT OUT!!!! Based on the popular DC comics, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice has been one of them highly anticipated movies of the year, This could be the movie that will Star the DC cinematic Universe... Properly, Like the Marvel Cinematic Universe like what the Avengers did.Me and Dad seen this yesterday night and, In my perspective, It was really good... Okey, confession time, I'm a Batman fan... Superman is a god hero, And I really Liked Wonder Woman in it, I was catch by surprise when she was in the Trailer, And this movie brought in Lex Luthor, as the Villain (No surprise because it was in the DC Comics!) And this is was the first movie to have a Superman enemy that never made an appearance in a Live Action Superman movie before... Doomsday, This move must have been inspired from well remembered events from Frank Millers Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, And Superman: Doomsday, I was impressed with the fight sense, I would recommend this to Fans of Batman or Superman... Surprisingly there's gonna be another DC comics movie that might be part of the universe this is from, Suicide Squad, It's staring The Joker (Which explains why his not in this) With many other Batman enemies from his Rogues Gallery, I'll be seeing that in my next Movie Review. I give this move 9 out of 10",9,2,3,24 August 2016
A Nightmare on Elm Street," JWB's Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 review
","Greetings Fanboys and Fangirls everywhere, Halloween is coming close, A time where monsters come out to scary the innocent, a time where Legendary Monsters like Dracula, Wolfman, and Frankinstain return to our media, A time... of Nightmares for he has returned, to murder us in our dreams, a being who refers himself as the Dream Master, A being who would make Jack the Ripper look like on old man... His Name... is Freddy Krueger, He first appeared in a Movie called A Nightmare on Elm Street Released in 1984 and Directed by the Guy who made SCREEM, Wes Craven From the history in this This was one of New Lines first ever successful movie they ever had involvement with, And this is the same movie company that did The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit Trilogy, The Mask, And the Blade Trilogy (Before Marvel got the rights of the Character back) and lets not forget that The 80's in some perspective the Year where Horror movies where taking over the cinema's along side Friday the 13th, Hellraiser, even some Horror movie that where... Frighteningly bad, I'm not sure what was going on there but I'm sure the people where into horror despite of the Ratings.The Stars of this is Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson (Much to my surprise and I never noticed She was Moto in Star Trek: Into Darkness) Glen Lantz was played by Pirates of the Carabian star himself Johnny Depp (And get this This was his First ever Movie he stared in, That's right Nightmare on Elm Street was the Beginning of Johnny Depp's Movie Star life) John Saxon as Lt. Don Thompson which in my opinion has done a very good job at his role, although trying to hide that fact that Freddy is killing people in there Dreams But I'll get to that later on, Ronee Blakley as Marge Thompson, Who in my opinion is more of a complete wreck, Hell Throughout the film she struggles with Nancy's growing instability from lack of sleep and adds locks to the doors and bars to the windows to try to keep Nancy in and the supposedly at-large killer out, turning to alcohol to deal with the stress, (Which doesn't help) and who is playing Freddy Krueger in this, Why it's non other then Robert Englund himself, Looking at his Wiki file he's done a lot after, He was the Riddler in 2005's The Batman show, He played Vulture in The Spectacular Spider-Man show and Felix Faust in Justice League.Funny enough I never watched any of the Nightmare movies until I got the Blu-Rays in 2014, And I was like this after watching the first movie Wes Craven & Robert Englund, You Mad son's of Bitch's, Not only did you create a Timeless Horror Movie Classic, But this movie Revalutionazed the Horror marketing, This idea originated from a real event of someone Having a nightmare that he was being chased by some maniac, and when he went to sleep, He died the morning after. And Let me tell you about the origin of Freddy, Frederick Charles 'Freddy' Krueger (a.k.a. The Springwood Slasher) is a child killer responsible for the kidnapping and murder of several children before he is eventually captured. Due to a legal technicality he is released without charge and the parents of the murdered children take the law into their own hands, burning him alive. After his death, Freddy gains the ability to infiltrate and control dreams and uses it to stalk and murder the remaining children of Elm Street. Despite being defeated several times, Freddy repeatedly resurrects himself and continues trying to kill children. Now the fact of some lunatic Murdering people in dreams is pretty terrifying when you put it that way, You can say that this movie is perfect for Halloween, Later on Freddy's movies would go into of Horror comedy, Freddy having his own T.V. Show that resembles The Twilight Zone Freddy vs Jason which put's Freddy against Jason and then there's the Remake in 2010, I will cover them later on but in the mean time, I better have Khadgar put anti-Dream Hacker wards around the place so not Dream-Psycho-Path kills me in my sleep.I give this move 10 out of 10",10,2,3,15 October 2016
Deadpool," JWB's Deadpool Review
","Greetings everyone, As I have promised, I'm gonna review-- Real Deadpool: DEADPOOL!!!! JWB: GOD DAMMIT DEADPOOL!!!!!! I was gonna say it first. Deadpool: Too late, I called it first. JWB: Yes the Deadpool Movie... Based on the Marvel Comic Hero of the same name, Played by Ryan Reynolds, If you remember reading the comics, He has a similar origin to that of Wolverine. Deadpool: And I have awesome Regenerative Powers, Much cooler then Wolverines. JWB: Right (Trying to hummer him), And Did I mention that Deadpool is insane like Charlie Sheen. Deadpool: Oh please, I'm more crazier then him, I'm more Crazy like The Mask, and the Joker from Batman, But I use my Lunatic Skills for the greater good... And the fact that Ryan Reynolds is my Stunt Double, I'd bee nothing without him. JWB: Oooookey, By the way I should point out that this wasn't the first movie Deadpool was in, No his first movie appearance was in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Yeah that movie didn't go right for Byan Singers original vision ,And given the X-Men (film series) that's saying a lot. Deadpool: And the that I was doing Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 so... I didn't make it to help out. By the way, Shouldn't you upgrade your old DVD copy of the movie to a Blu-Ray, just when you are ready to review it someday? JWB: Well, My DVD of the film is starting to get jumpy because of the scratches at the bottom of the disk, Wait, How did to... Wait, YOU'VE BEEN SNEACING AROUND MY ROOM WHILE I WAS AT WORK YESTERDAY, HOW DID YOU GET PAST MY DOGS AND GRANDMOTHER!!!!!!????? Deadpool: You forget, I'm a professional. JWB: May I please return to the Review? Deadpool: Procceed. JWB: Thank you.I treated mother to the movie and... well she liked it, But I for one enjoyed it as it, They stayed true to the Original source material which are the comics other then that Fantastic Four movie, The Forth-Wall Jokes where, I give credit for are quite funny, Original, Cleaver and very creative, The Character is aware that he is a fictional comic hero, Which makes Breaking the Forth-Wall work, I noticed it when I heard people in the theater room laughing, The Story is not all over the place, Makes me which I have got the Marvel Platinum book of The Definitive Deadpool so I can learn more about the character (If the book exists), Seeming that This is set in the same Cinematic universe as the X-Men, It's fare to have Colossus in it, By the way he looked and with that Russain voice, It's a big improvement from his previous appearances from the other X-Men movies, But one think remains, What the heck was Bob doing in this, I thought he was a Hydra Agent? Deadpool: Simple, I blackmailed him into the movie, Just as I Blackmailed you into this Review with that false evidence Letter. JWB: So it was you that got me into TROUBLE WITH LOVELIVE!!!! Deadpool: That's right... I was gonna Involve Shun Obihiro, Hoshimiya Akechi Blaze, Cornelia Angelite Kane, Kazuhikoyuku Tsukikawa, Brent Lee, Katrin Wei, Julio Iborra and Jossa Garbo Manalili into this, But You'll have to do. JWB: What, Shun and I have you in our own teams in Marvel Avengers Alliance. Deadpool: Ahh, But I know something you and them lot have in common, Your interests in the Pretty Cure Franchise... I might plan on signing myself up for a role in future Precure Allstars installment as the guy who drives them crazy, And I'll convince Loki, You know him, to be there Ultimate enemy. JWB: How is that gonna work? Even Shun might see some plot-holes in that plan. Deadpool: What about the Idea of my Guide book to driving magical girls insane is inspired from your Contingency plan book with Spiderman on it, Only to be used, Should Pretty Cure ever turn against you if they don't play by your rules? JWB: I have no Idea what your talking about (Lying), Can we get back to finishing this Review please? Deadpool: Okey. JWB: So yeah, I really enjoyed this movie, And I might look forward to what Deadpool might be up to next, It's clear that this is sent in the New Timeline thanks to X-Men Days of Future Past, I recommended this movie for anyone who is a Fan of the Merc with the mouth. And as always, if there is a Movie, Anime, Game or Comic you would like me to review, don't ever be afraid to bring it up in the comments below, Just don't make a big deal of it like Deadpool did with me on this. Deadpool: I have some questions, Why where you complaining about Cure Fortune's motives in episode one of HCPC, And is it true that You wanted Cure Tender to yourself, And-- JWB: Oh, that's it! I'm coming over! I'll f@#$ing whoop ya! Deadpool: Ha, Your gonna find that really challenging, I'm somewhere here you can't possibly find me. Roy Tovey: OH Joseph, There's a Random guy in a mask speaking to the Camera in the office! Deadpool: Ho-oh. JWB: Coming Roy. Deadpool: Wait wait, It's not what it looks like! JWB: You chicken-blowing, Leno-stick! COME HERE, BLACKMAIL ME ON LOVELIVE!!!! WILL YOU!!!! I'LL KILL YOU, YOU STUPID SON OF A BITCH!!!!!!-Fin-Deadpool: Hahaa, you said Fin (a punch is heard) Ow!",10,2,8,24 August 2016
