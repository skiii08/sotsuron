Mission: Impossible III," makes you feel good
","This was the best installment of the franchise and a blast. It is a bit tongue-in-cheek and a movie made to make you feel good and give a great start for your best summer ever. If that is kept in mind then the slight lack of constancy can be ignored. It has a mean cast with Tom being of course the center piece and doing one of his best acts. The pace of the movie is such as to leave you breathless and I didn't even feel a pressing need for a nature call which I normally do at movies. The flick is not to be taken with any seriousness, so serious people, like, don't bother, with one exception - the reference to the Bush administration and its 'war on terror' and unlawful occupation of Iraq. I prophesy it to become the biggest hitting of Tom Cruise movies.",8,2,3,11 May 2006
