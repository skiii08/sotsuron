The Sound of Music," One of a kind!
","This sweet (at some points overtly sweet) movie is outstanding.  Who, who has seen this movie, has not liked it?  You must have heart of stone to resist is sentimentality and sheer humanity.  The shy nun blooming, the mean yet handsome captain softening up, seven adorable children, mean nazis, and, oh, those magnificent nuns....And above all, the opening scene.  It is truly astounding to see those beautiful mountains and valleys suddenly being dwarfed by a young girl who run up that slope and into our hearts.",Null,3,11,24 December 2001
Casablanca," Mesmerising
","The true value of a movie is measured by its ability to overcome generation gaps, time, and trends and still remain a true winner.  Casablanca is one of the very few movies that have succeeded in doing so.  Why that is so is a great mystery.  Maybe its the way everything blends together, maybe its the way it was all put together, maybe, maybe.  Analysing this is sometimes fruitless.  All one can say is that watching this movie over and over again makes us feel good!!!  Need one say more?",10,1,1,24 December 2001
Schindler's List," A ray of light shining on the darkest page of history
","Steven Spielburg finally proved to everybody that he is indeed a great director.  We see here a movie that cannot be describes with simple words. What, I believe, gave this movie its soul is that fact that the director and his crew truly dedicated this remarkable feat to the victims of the darkest pages of history.   Frightening as the scenes were,  so was its message of final redemption.  Concentrating on the few who survived rather than the millions who perished was indeed a dangerous step that could have offended many.  And yet Steven pulled it off.  Through the survivors he honoured the dead.  Such complex feelings I had never felt at the movie theatres before. More words are useless.",10,9,13,24 December 2001
