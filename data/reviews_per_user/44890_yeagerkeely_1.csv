10 Cloverfield Lane," Ending Ruined It :(
","This film started out extremely strong, with it's thriller/horror elements pulsing throughout the films many tense moments. The film was even in its downtime conversations, and sometimes terrifying sequences. The film uses the plot of Howard thinking there are aliens beyond the bunker as a good device for how he lies to both the main characters in order to secure them in the bunker. But the film is unfortunately being literal on this, and there really are aliens outside in big ships, flying around the place. What the hell? Then the movie literally becomes Cloverfield and the girl blows up one of the ships. I'm sorely disappointed that this film had to be a part of the Cloverfield Series, even though J.J. Abrams states it isn't. Overall the ending was something I couldn't and still can't get over.",2,1,2,21 July 2018
