Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wonderful Film
","Great movie, and a great beginning to the saga. Deceivingly complex in it's storyline, and generally only loved by the true fans. 2nd in my opinion only to the first 'Star Wars' in 77', but that film is so perfect it's impossible to top and I wouldn't have expected it too.Easy to rip on only because 'Star Wars' is such a huge target. Best film of 1999. And no, 'Empire' is not the best 'Star Wars.' A wonderful movie, but it was very 'confined' in it's scope. Half of the film was in a swamp or in a spaceship. Again, very confined.'Phantom Menace' is the opposite. Huge complex vistas, thousands of things happening in each frame. What 'Star Wars' was always supposed to be. In an era of cynicism and dark films (see 'The Matrix'), it's nice to see a simple clash between good and evil again. A great ride.",10,5,7,4 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Weakest-yes, weakest of the saga
","I am going against the grain here, but I thought this was actually the weakest and least 'Star Wars' like of the 'Star Wars' films. It feels very confined to me. Where are the sweeping visuals? Cloud City is the most exotic locale and even that is pretty sterile looking (although it was helped GREATLY with the 'Special Edition'additions). I like the darker tone of it but there's just not enough going on here in terms of action. That said, it's still a great movie and one of my favorites, but it's my least favorite of the saga so far.",10,0,0,6 March 2002
