Love and Death," Not Quite As Funny As 'The Seventh Seal' But Close...
","LOVE AND DEATH (3 outta 5 stars)Minor Woody Allen comedy but it has a few laughs in it... which is more than one can say for a lot of his later efforts. It probably helps to have read a lot of Russian novels or seen a lot of Russian (and Swedish) films before trying to watch this. Still, Allen and Keaton have good on screen chemistry (which they would have perfected by their next film, 'Annie Hall') and the jokes or near-jokes keep coming at a steady pace. Verbal wordplay comes very near the quality of prime Marx Brothers material, e.g. Drill Sergeant: 'One, two, one, two, one, two.' Boris: 'Three is next, if you're having any trouble.' --- Boris: 'If a man said that to me, I'd break his neck.' Anton: '*I* am a man.' Boris: 'Well, I mean a much shorter man.')",6,3,8,12 September 2004
Minority Report," Half An Hour Too Long... But Good Stuff!
","MINORITY REPORT (3+ outta 5 stars) Interesting premise (inspired by a short story by Philip K Dick) about a future society whose law enforcement relies on a trio of powerful psychics who can predict crimes before they happen so that the perpetrators can be apprehended *before* the harm is done. Complications ensue when one of the top law officers (Tom Cruise) becomes implicated in a murder. He goes on the lam, waiting for a chance to prove that he has no intention of killing anyone and doesn't even *know* the man is supposed to kill. I would probably like this movie twice as much if it had the last half hour chopped off. The true climax of the movie comes when Cruise finally confronts the man he is supposed to kill. (An extremely powerful confrontation that actually had me in tears the first time I saw it.) After that we get a totally predictable finale with the good guys triumphing over the bad guys (and neatly side-stepping a lot of the murkier issues of morality and justice raised in the first 4/5 of the film). Based on this and 'A-I' I am beginning to think that ALL Spielberg movies should just automatically have the last 30 minutes chopped off. Still, this is a fun movie... probably Spielberg's best action movie since the original 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. There are a few goofy scenes of 'comedy relief' that may be inspired by Terry Gilliam's films... but they seem really out of place here (an eyeball-chasing scene in particular).",7,1,2,29 March 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Hollywood!!! Don't You DARE Try To Remake This!!!
","SHAUN OF THE DEAD (4+ outta 5 stars)Definitely the best movie in the 'living dead' genre since the original 'Dawn of the Dead'!  Even though the movie is a comedy, the humour comes from the characters of the people who find themselves in the midst of a zombie invasion... the zombies themselves are as creepy and as deadly as in the George A Romero originals.  Shaun, an aging English working man, afraid to grow up into a mature adult and having girlfriend trouble as a result, wakes up one day to find London being overrun with flesh-eating zombies. This might just be the chance he is looking for to make something of himself in the eyes of his girl... if he can just avoid being eaten.  This isn't a silly spoof in the style of the 'Scary Movie' series...  it is a genuinely effective mix of laughter and suspense.  British actors are so great at portraying these 'working class' characters and making them funny and also easy to identify with.  From the opening strains of The Specials single 'Ghost Town' the movie seems to do everything right... and there are so many ways it could conceivably go wrong.  Much as I enjoyed the recent 'Dawn of the Dead' remake... this movie is clearly the Zombie Movie of the Year! (Also it's nice to see the old-style zombies again... slow, lurching and relentless.)",9,0,1,2 August 2004
Oldboy," Why Is This Rated So High? Because It's THAT Good!
",OLDBOY (4+ outta 5 stars) This is one of those movies that is just going to get better and better every time I watch it... I just know it. An incredible Korean thriller that really packs a punch at the end (though it is a very unconventional ending and bound to bother some people). I can't really say too much about the movie without risk of giving things away... but here's the movie in a nutshell. After being bailed out of jail on a drunk and disorderly charge Oh Daesu (Min-Sik Choi) is kidnapped and confined to small apartment where he is cut off from the entire world except for a TV. His meals are brought to him through a small trap door and every now and then he is gassed into unconsciousness and his captors clean up after him. After living like this for FIFTEEN YEARS he is suddenly set free with no explanation. He vows bloody revenge on the person who did this to him but he also desperately needs the answer to the question 'why'? To say too much more would ruin the odd twists and turns. The movie gets pretty nasty at times (explicit sex and violence) but is not a senseless barrage of constant action like some Asian thrillers. Watching it for the first time I wasn't quite sure what to make of it at times... but having finished it the first time I can't wait to go back and see it again.,9,16,95,11 January 2005
Spider-Man 2," If Only They'd Used The Cartoon Music Instead of That Alt-Rock Schlock...
","SPIDER-MAN 2 (4 outta 5 stars)Yes, it's true... another sequel that turns out to be even better than the first one. The young cast (Toby Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco) are back from the first movie... as is the director, Sam Raimi. This time the action scenes don't look as clumsy as they did the first time. The CGI effects look a little less fake and the editing is a little tighter. Best of all, there is a story APART FROM the action and the fights! Peter Parker is not having the bets luck in the world... mostly, he decides, because of the burden of being Spider-Man. When his powers start to weaken he decides that maybe he needs to give up the whole superhero thing and concentrate on just being a regular guy. But, naturally, events take place which make that impossible... most notably the threat posed by Dr. Otto Octavius... Dr. Octopus. The movie has a great blend of humour, action and sentimentality... I confess that I got a little misty-eyed a few times. It's not all perfect... a lot of the close-ups of screaming bystanders look a little corny, the crappy alt-rock muzak they play at the end seems really hackneyed... also it's getting to be a bit of a stretch to have Aunt May and Mary Jane always at the mercy of whatever super-villain happens to be in town. Minor quibbles to be sure... the main problem with this movie is that it's such a vivid distillation of the Spider-man mythos that it doesn't leave much else to be said in any future sequels.",8,0,0,4 July 2004
Crash," An Unrelenting Parade of Ironies
","CRASH (2 outta 5 stars) I was really expecting to like this movie... there is a lot of great acting in it and some provocative dialogue and I generally love ensemble-type movies like this. So why did this movie irk me so much by the time it was all over? Maybe it was the piling on of one contrived coincidence after another. After a while I was not having the 'oh-wow' reaction that was surely intended... but more like 'oh-good-grief'. Plus the unrelenting parade of ironies wore out its welcome after the first thirty minutes. Okay, fine, we get it... people are not 'good' or 'bad' but they all have *both* goodness and badness in them... you can stop hammering that point home now! After awhile it just started to ring false... like we were no longer eavesdropping on real-life situations but viewing the work of a biased sociologist who is manipulating the facts to support his thesis. So many scenes just didn't seem very realistic: the Persian man grabbing the gun and going after the locksmith, Ryan Philippe's overwrought reaction to a hitchhiker, even Sandra Bullock's sudden realization of who her 'real friend' is seemed false. (Aside: we really didn't need to have Sandra's character come out and SAY that her housekeeper was the best friend she's got... the weepy eyes and the the hug was enough, okay? A little more subtlety at times like this would have definitely helped the movie.) And have I mentioned the music yet? Oh please, please, please, make it STOP! That pretentious 'angelic' score just kept grating on my nerves the more I heard it. The movie is not all bad. Ludicrous's character steals the movie... personally I think they should have just followed him and Larenz Tate around for 2 hours and ejected some of those other subplots. The bedtime scene with the locksmith and his little girl was very sweet and touching in itself but I felt it was enormously cheapened by the later confrontation with the shopkeeper... it was no longer a scene about the characters but merely a 'set-up' for a (contrived) 'pay-off'.",4,96,183,11 May 2005
The Beach," The Book Isn't THAT Much Better...
","THE BEACH (3+ outta 5 stars) Most people who are familiar with the book deride this movie as if it was a crime of the highest magnitude. Well, having read the book and not being overly fond of it (it was a good, light read and nothing more) I judge the movie to be a fine adaptation. Sure, they had to chop out some characters and situations and speed things along because it is only a 2 hour movie... but I think what they kept in is reasonably entertaining. The plot, dialogue and acting are all up to par. The movie as a whole may not be up there with 'Trainspotting' or '28 Days Later'... but as a 'star vehicle' for rising young actor Leonardo DiCaprio it does the job... and the result isn't something that he should be overly embarrassed about as it keeps popping up in his resume. A young, pretentious American goes abroad to experience life as regular tourists seldom do. He hears of a mysterious island that is supposedly the closest thing to paradise on Earth.. but once he gets there he learns that people and paradise don't mix well together. The movie is not nearly as bad as the reviews of the time would have you believe... it's also not nearly as deep and profound as fans of the book would have you believe.",7,0,2,5 September 2005
Blade II," Sometimes Bad CGI Is Worse Than No CGI...
","BLADE 2 (2+ outta 5 stars) Wesley Snipes did a good job on the first Blade movie so I have no beef with him coming back to make more of them. For this second installment the filmmakers came up with a decent story and a good bunch of actors. Unfortunately, the script could have used a little more pizazz... and they could have used a lot less phony CGI work in the fight scenes. I realize Snipes may not be a trained fighter... but replacing him with an unconvincing CGI simulation does not help the movie one bit. I think this time around Snipes came on a little too strong with his 'cool' persona. Blade definitely came off as cool in the first movie... but this time he comes off more as someone desperately *pretending* to be cool. Kris Kristofferson makes a welcome return as Blade's previously deceased partner and he seems to get the better one-liners, while Blade himself is stuck with dud lines like, 'Keep pushing, a**hole.' Ron Perlman does a pretty good job as well, playing an uneasy ally of Blade's. They are forced to team up to destroy a special kind of vampire that feeds on other vampires and so is ultimately more dangerous to mankind. It's all fast-paced and kind of interesting but all that jumping around and blowing things up does get a little old after a while.",5,2,4,5 June 2005
Malcolm X," Exciting and Dynamic Biopic!
","MALCOLM X (4+ outta 5 stars) Spike Lee's most ambitious project... and it is *almost* the film classic that he had hoped to make (I believe he wanted the Malcolm X bio to be an African-American 'Lawrence of Arabia'). Unfortunately, Lee's ego gets in the way a couple of times... not enough to ruin the movie... but he does get the eyeballs to roll a couple of times. First off (let me get the bad stuff outta the way first), when is he gonna outgrow that infantile 'A Spike Lee Joint' crap? It was cute for some of his wacky indie comedies... but not a 'real' movie... come on now! Second, why does the movie have to start with Spike walking down the street pretending to be cool in his zoot suit? Is this 'The Spike Lee Story'? Nope, it's 'Malcolm X'... so cut out those first 2 minutes please and start the movie out in the barber shop! Third, that dance number at the start is kinda cool (even if it is totally unnecessary) but, for the love of Lean, does it have to end with Spike sliding down the floor towards the camera, beaming out at the audience like this is some cheesy music video? Okay... time to let it go... all the bad stuff is over with in the first twenty minutes... everything that follows is pretty dang cool (which just makes those three lapses in judgment all the more annoying). Denzel gives a great performance as Malcolm... definitely the only actor who could have done the role justice. The script is great... telling the whole story... from Malcolm's less auspicious beginnings... to the revelations he discovers in prison... to his eventual role as one of the most eloquent and powerful speakers that the world has ever known. You don't even have to agree with everything the man says to realize that the man had a gift... and a voice that the world will know forever. The movie is a nearly-great epic and, after 'Do The Right Thing', is undoubtedly Lee's best work.",9,6,15,12 June 2005
Lost in Translation," Great Performances in a Moody Comedy-Drama
","LOST IN TRANSLATION (3+ outta 5 stars)Well-handled comedy-drama about two lonely, confused (and married) people who develop a bond during a stay in a Tokyo hotel.   Bill Murray plays a famous actor in Tokyo to film a series of bizarre commercials... Scarlett Johansson plays a young wife accompanying her husband, who is on a job and too busy to spend much time with her.  Unable to sleep and with too much free time on their hands, they turn to each other for comfort and companionship.  Bill and Scarlett both give great performances... naturalistic and effortless.  There really isn't much of a plot... beyond the obvious question of 'How far is this relationship going to go?'  Sofia Coppola (daughter of Francis Ford) wrote and directed and, on the basis of this, there are probably some really good films in her future.  Bill was definitely robbed at the Academy Awards this year... no way should Sean Penn's method over-acting have been chosen over this.",7,0,1,6 July 2004
The Aviator," Finally... Scorsese Back In Top Form!
","THE AVIATOR (4+ outta 5 stars) Wow... did I just see the best movie of the year? I can't think of anything better... but then again I haven't seen even a fraction of the 2004 releases that I want to. Lately I don't see the point of going to see a movie in the theatre when the DVD release 6 months later is going to be an 'extended director's cut' with tons of extras and deleted scenes, etc. Plus you don't have to put up with lousy projection, rude audiences and sticky floors (well, okay, me floor isn't always perfect either). However, one of the few directors that I will still go out of my way to see on the big screen is Martin Scorsese. Even though his last few movies have not really been his best ('Bringing Out The Dead', 'Gangs of New York', 'Casino')... even when his movies are merely *average* they are still better than most other directors at the top of their game. The movie's style starts off very low-key... almost like a plain old biopic that any competent director could have made... but, as the story progresses, more and more little Scorsese moments can be detected... and by the end you are totally swept up in complete movie magic. Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific as Howard Hughes. I really had my doubts when I first heard he was playing the role... and maybe he does seem a little too baby-faced early on... but by the end he has the role totally nailed. (One of my favorite movie accents, too... his voice comes out like a cross between Ron Howard and Jack Nicholson.) Cate Blanchett is almost guaranteed an Oscar nomination playing Katharine Hepburn. (You know, I was never aware that her and Hughes had that close a relationship.) Lots of other fine actors in bit parts: Alec Baldwin, Jude Law, Alan Alda, Brent Spiner, Kate Beckinsale and Gwen Stefani.",9,0,3,2 January 2005
Van Helsing," Is This a Movie or a Video Game???
","VAN HELSING (2+ outta 5 stars)Yeah, I know it got terrible reviews when it first came out... but, dang it, the trailers looked COOL! I mean, Hugh Jackman in that funky long hat and floppy hat... chucking those nasty boomerang blades at bad guys? And taking on not only Dracula and the Frankenstein monster... but the Wolf Man, too? Shoulda been a winner! Unfortunately the movie went wrong in sooooooooo many ways. I mean, it's not a total drag but it definitely has too many strikes against it. First problem: wayyyyyyyyyyy too much reliance on CGI. When are the techno geeks making these movies going to get it thru their heads... CGI still looks FAKE! If you use it sparingly you can trick audiences into believing that they are seeing something impossible happen... but when its just effect after effect after effect... well, we might as well be watching someone playing a video game. Second problem: bad acting. Jackman is alright as Van Helsing... and that one blond chick with the weird accent was kinda fun... but Kate Beckinsale as the butt-kickin' gypsy wench was just embarrassing. Ditto for the dude playing Dracula. And I really could have done without the characters speaking in modern vernacular. Vampires exclaiming, 'Too bad, so sad'??? Puh-leeeeeeeease! Third problem: this goes back to the CGI thing... there was too much reliance on mindless action for action's sake... the characters needed some more dialogue! Maybe a few scenes to make us care about these characters (so that the small tragedy at the end might have actually *meant* something)? So, do yourself a favor and forget about this bizarre attempt at combining James Bond with Hammer Films... and go see 'Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter' which is 10 times the movie this is.",5,1,2,28 November 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Just When You Think Hollywood's Completely Forgotten What A Funny Script Looks Like...
","THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN (4 outta 5 stars) A movie with this concept would be so easy to turn into a piece of utter crap a la 'Deuce Bigelow'. It's so rare to find a movie that can actually balance big laughs with honest character development. Steve Carell does a great job portraying Andy, a character quite unlike the loud, obnoxious types that he's best known for. Again, it would be very easy for actor to screw things up by overdoing the stereotype... but Carell does a nice balancing act... playing nerdy without making it too creepy. Catherine Keener has a great role, too... as the single mother of three who begins a relationship with Andy... not knowing the dreaded secret that has only recently come to the attention of his (messed up in their own way) co-workers. Written by Carell and director Judd Apatow (known for TV's 'Freaks and Geeks')... maybe this will start a new trend of comedy movies with ACTUAL SCRIPTS?",8,2,4,27 August 2005
Duck You Sucker," Another Sergio Leone masterpiece... Duck You Sucker!!!
","A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE aka DUCK YOU SUCKER (5 outta 5 stars)I think this is Sergio Leone's third greatest movie... right after Once Upon a Time in the West and The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.  Most Leone fans rank this film a lot lower... but I think that's because they are only familiar with the shortened two hour version.  Also, for the record, I absolutely loathe the re-titling... A Fistful of Dynamite... how lame!  At least the original Leone title, Duck You Sucker was... distinctive.  Even the French title (translation: Once Upon a Time... The Revolution) is kinda classy. But AFOD???  Gimme a break!  This movie has absolutely nothing to do with A Fistful of Dollars so why even try to make the comparison?Anyway, I loved this movie when I first saw it in the theatre in 1972 (age 12).  I am pretty sure that what we saw at the time was the lengthy, uncut version... and I don't remember being bored at all.  (The most common complaint about this movie is that it is slow and boring... heck, that's the most common complaint about EVERY Leone movie.)  Rod Steiger and James Coburn play Sean and Juan, respectively a poor Mexican bandit and a fugitive Irish terrorist... who meet up in Mexico and become involved (against their wills) with revolutionary warfare in that struggling country.  The movie is exciting, funny, dramatic, suspenseful and, well, just plain brilliant. This is Ennio Morricone's greatest film score and the way it meshes with Leone's visuals is simply amazing... particularly in my favourite scene... the bank heist.  Juan and his young sons break into the Bank of Mexico, shoot it out with the guards and go from door to door, searching for gold and finding only political prisoners, until finally... oh, I can't give it away!  See it for yourself.  This is a movie filled with classic scenes: Coburn's arrival on the 'motorsickle' and his confrontation with Steiger's gang... Steiger and Coburn with their machine guns... Steiger's final act of vengeance (which is severely chopped to bits in the short version... robbing it of its vicious power).  Its been said that Steiger's comical accent is stereotypical and insulting... but I say NO!  He is playing one of the richest and most complex characters of his career... with some of his greatest speeches ('And what happens to the poor people?  They are DEAD!'). Not to slight James Coburn, who also does a fantastic job, but Steiger is the star of this one.",10,62,87,29 July 2004
The Butterfly Effect," A Much Better Movie Than You Would Suspect...
","THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT- THEATRICAL CUT (4 outta 5 stars)THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT- DIRECTOR'S CUT (3+ outta 5 stars)Now normally I tend to prefer movies that let the writer/director tell the story that they want to without having to water it down for mass consumption. In this case I have to say that the ending they they were forced to re-shoot for the theatrical release of this movie is a much more emotional, resonant and appropriate ending than the bleak, cold and grotesque finale they had originally planned. On the US DVDs you get the choice of which version to see (foreign editions only have the less compelling director's version)... so North American viewers can make up their own mind about which ending they prefer. I would suggest watching the theatrical cut first... and then check out the director's cut... which would you prefer to think of as the 'real' ending?As for the movie itself... don't be put off by the idea of Ashton Kutcher in the lead role. He does quite a good job in a serious part quite different from his usual TV persona. He plays a college student who, having been plagued by mental blackouts all his life, devotes himself to the study of human memory. Eventually he finds that by re-reading old journal entries he can will himself back in time to experience the events he had blacked out... and even CHANGE THEM using the knowledge that his older self possesses. Unfortunately one small change in the past causes some HUGE ramifications in his present day world. Can't say too much more about the plot without giving away the many fun surprises. Believable performances and a basic seriousness give the film an urgency that is sometimes missing in modern fantasy films of this type.",8,124,175,21 November 2004
Batman Begins," Best Batman Ever? Yep, I'd Have To Agree...
","BATMAN BEGINS (4 outta 5 stars) When I first heard about this movie... and saw some of the preliminary designs (big rubber mask, fancy Bat-gear, tank-like Batmobile) I expected the worst... some brainless action movie with lots of noise and explosions and not much else. I thought the world needed another 'Batman' movie like it needed another 'Rocky'. Well, I was wrong. This is definitely the best 'Batman' movie ever filmed. Much as I enjoyed the first Tim Burton movie, I have to admit that it's Jack Nicholson's performance that made it memorable. The script had some fun scenes and some good one-liners but it didn't really have a satisfying story. This time around they have a decent script to build their action scenes on. The story and screenplay by David Goyer and director Christopher ('Memento') Nolan deals with the entirety of the Batman legend... telling us in great detail just how he evolved from rich playboy to obsessed crime-fighter. I found it amazing how the movie could pack in so much story and background and not make it all seem rushed and crammed together. They even toss in a completely unnecessary love interest for Bruce Wayne... a childhood sweetheart played by Katie Holmes... but it still works! The movie's elements all come together and even though there are several name actors in small roles (Rutger Hauer, Liam Neeson, Ken Watanabe, Tom Wilkinson, Morgan Freeman... not to mention Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Caine as Alfred the butler) none of them seem short-changed on screen time... or good lines. Michael Caine almost walks off with the movie... as probably the definitive Alfred... but Morgan Freeman gives him some fierce competition as the Wayne Foundation science tech who is able to provide Batman with some of his fancy crime-fighting equipment. Christian Bale is probably the best actor who has taken on the role so far. In previous movies the Bat-suit was the star... it didn't really matter much WHO they put in it. This time, Bruce Wayne takes center stage and Bale makes us see him as a man... and not just a secret identity. There are minor flaws (Ken Watanabe could have been used more, the Scarecrow character seemed a bit superfluous) but this still ranks as one of the best superhero movies ever done.",8,3,4,1 August 2005
The Incredibles," DC and Marvel *Wish* They Could Make Movies This Cool
","THE INCREDIBLES (4 outta 5 stars)Another winner from the geniuses at Pixar... and, yeah, Disney, I guess. (Is it just me or did Disney go a bit too far with the advertising and product hustling this time around? I felt deluged with the hype weeks before the movie even came out.) Fortunately, the movie itself is a fine piece of work... the story of a family of super-powered heroes who are forced to assimilate into regular society and not utilize their 'gifts'. But a crazed super-genius has a plan to rule the world and the heroes need to come out of retirement and re-vitalize their fighting skills to keep the world safe. The usual Pixar elements are in full force... the humour, the expressive animation, the story elements equally suited to adults AND children... I seriously doubt that anyone at Disney had a thing to do with this movie... besides stamping their logo on all the toys. Great voice work by such actors as Craig T Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L Jackson and Jason Lee. One complaint: the wonderful scene from the promos with Mr. Incredible fighting to put on his too-small superhero outfit... why isn't it in the MOVIE???? Hellooooooooo??? Funniest scene ever... NOT in the movie??? Ugh... gotta wait for the DVD, I guess.",8,2,4,21 November 2004
Million Dollar Baby," *sniff* Dammit, Clint Made Me Cry!
","MILLION DOLLAR BABY (4 outta 5 stars) Clint's movies seem to be getting sadder and sadder as he gets older... not his trademark good-guy-gets-the-bad-guy stuff... but realistic, human stories of heavy emotion. 'Unforgiven', 'White Hunter, Black Heart', 'Mystic River' and now, his latest, 'Million Dollar Baby'. I was leery of the premise of this from the start... Clint playing a crusty old curmudgeon of a boxing coach who takes on a spunky young gal (Hilary Swank) against his 'better' (i.e. male chauvinist) judgment. Well, of course, the young spunky gal proves herself and they go on together to fight a championship bout... but then things take a darker turn. A very powerful movie... with great performances by Eastwood, Swank and, as usual, Morgan Freeman. Some of the other performances are a little off-putting. The redneck parents of Swank's character are played a little too broad (especially the clichéd ex-con husband covered in tattoos). The slow-witted kid who hangs around the gym serves no purpose. And the priest that Eastwood talks to after mass every day... well, he's kind of a jerk, isn't he? He started out as an interesting character... but when called upon for compassion or insight towards the end he doesn't seem to have much to offer. Oh well, minor flaws... but a little tweaking here and there could have made this a truly Oscar-worthy pic. As it stands, I still think 'The Aviator' ranks a tad higher.",8,0,2,13 February 2005
Garden State," When Is Natalie Portman Going To Find a Man Her Own Age?
","GARDEN STATE (2+ outta 5 stars) I had high expectations for this movie... but, after finally seeing it, I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. It's well-done... the acting is fine and the directing and writing are decent... but over-all the movie just seems to be missing the final spark to set the whole thing aflame. Zach Braff (of TV's best sitcom, Scrubs) stars as a severely depressed actor, hooked on medication, who returns to his old hometown for his mother's funeral. He faces some childhood issues and, with the help of a funny, spunky (and underage???) girl he meets in a hospital waiting room, he gets off his pills and starts to enjoy life once again. How many movies has Natalie Portman been in now where she plays the funny, spunky (underage?) girl who is the catalyst for the renewal of an older man's appreciation of life? (Leon The Professional, Beautiful Girls, Closer... can we work Star Wars in there somehow?) Maybe the problem with the movie is just that it starts out so slow and ponderous as it sets up the bleak, depressive state of its main character? Maybe if it had started with him meeting Natalie Portman and then working backwards to explain his condition it might have been easier to sit through? Anyway, a nice try from director/writer Braff... but it just didn't work for me.",Null,1,6,2 April 2005
Casualties of War," Excellent script and acting add up to a Must-See War Classic!
",CASUALTIES OF WAR (4 outta 5 stars) Excellent character drama that takes place during the Vietnam war. Michael J Fox plays the conscientious newbie who is placed under the command of the slightly psycho Sgt. Meserve (Sean Penn). After he and his men are denied an R and R trip into town Meserve decides that on their next mission he and his squad will kidnap a Vietnamese girl (on the pretext that she is a Viet Cong spy) and have their way with her. Michael J wants no part of this... but the sergeant is ordering him to take his turn. And how are the other men in the squad going to react to someone who is not a team player? ('You could get killed real easy. Don't you know that? Somebody stumbles. They don't *mean* to shoot you. They're sorrrrrry.') Great script... great acting... great direction... and a score by Ennio Morricone... what more could anyone want in a war movie?,Null,0,1,2 January 2005
Shrek 2," Uh... Tom Waits and Nick Cave? How The Heck Did They Get Invited?
","SHREK 2 (3+ outta 5 stars) Not quite as good as the first movie... but still pretty good. I think the main problem is that they tried to squeeze too many characters in from the first movie instead of concentrating on new ones? (Did we really need to see Pinocchio and the Gingerbread Man again?) The highlight of this movie is the introduction of Antonio Banderas as 'Puss in Boots' but, PLEASE, IF THERE IS A SHREK 3 YOU DON'T NEED TO SHOE-HORN HIM IN THERE AGAIN! It reminds me of the Saturday Night Live syndrome where they keep doing sketches with the same character but every new sketch is just a little bit less funny than the one before it... until eventually you forget why the character was even funny in the first place. I could have even done without the donkey this time around... but I guess they *had* to put Eddie Murphy back in... even though he served no purpose and wasn't even as funny this time around. On the plus side, there are lots of funny bits... and some touching moments and some decent music (Tom Waits and Nick Cave BOTH contributing to the soundtrack??? Woo hoo! Too bad about that atrocious re-make of The Buzzcocks' 'Ever Fallen In Love'... couldn't they have just used the original? Why must the children be made to suffer so?) Shrek and Fiona (and Donkey... uh, why is he there again?) take a trip to meet Fiona's folks, whose hoity-toity royal pedigree doesn't quite mesh with their daughter's new-found ogre-ness. There is a new villain this time around (thank goodness they resisted the temptation to bring Farquad back from the dead)... a fairy godmother (played by Jennifer Saunders) who isn't actually as benevolent as she pretends to be. I just wonder if all these modern pop culture references (The Matrix, Americican Idol) are going to make sense to viewers in another 20 years?",7,0,1,2 April 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Neither Better Nor Worse Than The Original
","CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (3 outta 5 stars) A decent enough version of the classic children's story which was the basis for the beloved musical 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.' I didn't find this movie any better or worse than the original version... just different. Johnny Depp's bizarre performance as Willy Wonka is definitely the best thing about this movie... just as Gene Wilder was the best thing about the original 'Wonka'. I was a bit puzzled as to why they decided not to use the original songs from the first movie... but then they went ahead and created new songs for the Oompa-Loompas anyway... I guess it was cheaper to make up new songs than to pay the original composer for the rights to re-record them. I like the character of Charlie more in this new version that the annoying little goody-goody in the first movie... but I think I prefer Jack Albertson as the original grandpa. The storyline basically is the same as the earlier flick... except for the conclusion (I'm not sure which ending is closer to what was written in Roald Dahl's novel... I guess I'll have to read it one day). I was a bit dismayed by the fact that the greedy, nasty kids in this movie don't seem to learn a lesson from their harrowing experiences in the chocolate factory... they seem just as selfish and ill-mannered when they leave as when they arrived... you'd think a near-death experience would shake them up a bit more...",6,0,1,2 January 2006
Saw," Poor Cousin to Se7en
","SAW (2 outta 5 stars)This sounded like such a good idea for a movie that I thought it couldn't possibly miss. Unfortunately I didn't count on the poor acting, the clichéd 'wife and child in danger' scenes and the botched attempts at suspense. Two men awaken in an abandoned men's room... their ankles chained to opposite sides of the room. They have been put there by a bizarre serial killer who likes his victims to actively participate in their own demise. So each man gets a saw to free himself... the catch being that the saw blade isn't strong enough to cut the chains... to get free they would have to cut through their own leg. There is a time limit... and one man has to get free and kill the other or his family will die... yadda yadda yadda. Too bad the suspense inherent in this situation is put on hold to emphasize less-interesting sequences like a little girl who isn't believed when she says there's a man hiding in her closet. The movie isn't a total write-off... there are a few well-done scenes and some interesting red herrings... but ultimately the film is a big disappointment.",4,3,6,21 November 2004
A Clockwork Orange," A Timeless Classic!
","A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (5 outta 5 stars)One of the most wildly, imaginative and fascinating movies ever made. Stanley Kubrick's obsessive eye for detail elaborates this simple science fiction tale of a cruel, young sociopath who is 'conditioned' to become a 'normal' human being. Amazing performance by Malcolm McDowell (just look how long he is held underwater and beaten in one extended take!) The lead character of Alex is one of the most evil characters ever portrayed on film... and yet he also gains audience sympathy as the story progresses. I've always thought it incredible that the author of the book actually experienced the vicious home invasion that takes place in the movie... and yet he went on to write a novel from the point of view of the rapist of his wife... making him the HERO. The movie was banned in England for many years. It was claimed by some that the movie promotes and glorifies violence. What crap! Anyone who is 'turned on' by the violence in this film needs help... seriously.",10,0,2,14 November 2004
National Treasure," Did The Illuminati Fund This Movie To Further Mask Their Nefarious Schemes?
","NATIONAL TREASURE (3 outta 5 stars) After hearing some of the initial reviews I was expecting something of a train wreck here. Actually, the movie is not bad at all... in a cheesy kind of Saturday afternoon time-killing way. Some of the actions of the characters strain credibility at times... but if you just sit back and let the plot play out it's all quite entertaining. A pair of eccentric treasure hunters pick up a female ally along the way as they try to beat a rich bad man at finding the greatest cache of treasure of all time. Nicolas Cage gives an effortlessly engaging lead performance. His male and female sidekicks (Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha) play off him quite well. The main villain (Sean Bean) is a more low-key bad guy than we tend to see in movies these days... he doesn't go on and on ranting and raving and screaming to prove how bad he is... he just proves it quite matter-of-factly through his actions. Jon Voigt and Harvey Keitel do alright in a couple of minor roles that don't do much for their acting cred but probably gave their bank accounts a boost. It didn't even strike me until the very end that this was indeed a Disney MOVIE... one very much like the adventure movies they used to put out in the 50s. I was also pleasantly surprised that there were less dumb action stunts than I expected. The two major stunt scenes in the film (a car chase and a stairway cave-in) were pretty un-inspired... the movie wisely concentrates more on plot and dialogue.",6,164,271,12 December 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Terrified... mortified... petrified... stupefied... by this movie!
","A BEAUTIFUL MIND (3 outta 5 stars)I had put off seeing this movie for such a long time... people kept saying how good it was and how good an actor Russell Crowe is yadda yadda yadda... and I just didn't care.  I was sick of the hype surrounding his ridiculously over-praised 'Gladiator' movie and not seeing this movie would be my revenge!  But, as luck would have it, it was on Canadian TV the other night... unedited (broadcast TV in Canada is soooooo cool)... and I figured maybe it was time.  Well, the movie started to lose me at first... it started out a little too predictable and then took a few implausible turns. Just as I was about to give up on it... some major plot developments had me looking at the movie with new eyes.  By the midway point, the movie had me hooked.  Not a perfect movie though... Crowe's performance does seem a little too 'act-y' at times... and Jennifer Connelly is... well, she does the same thing she does in all her movies... some people seem to like it... me, not so much.  Once again, Ron Howard takes a movie subject that I find somewhat less than compelling (what? another eccentric genius who becomes a beloved teacher?) and turns it into a fine film.",6,0,2,14 August 2004
War of the Worlds," Coulda Been Worse... Coulda Been Better...
","WAR OF THE WORLDS (3 outta 5 stars) Not one of the best Spielberg movies (not even the best Spielberg/Tom Cruise collaboration) but the movie has a lot of good stuff in it and is a lot better than the average 'summer action' movie. The movie starts out pretty well... with some very believable and well-directed bits of suspense (the lightning, the wind, the cracks slowly opening up the ground). The alien tripods (and their accompanying sound effects) are a pretty scary sight for the most part. I found the death rays a little silly (uh, why are the martians blasting humans to atoms anyway when it is discovered later that they are harvesting their blood?) but the depiction of the panic and the widespread devastation get top marks. The problems with this movie are mostly apparent after the scene on the ferry. It seems that after that scene the filmmakers can't decide what to do next.. so Spielberg retreads old suspense 'gimmicks' from previous movies. There is a ridiculous scene with three humans hiding out in a wide-open, bombed-out basement and remain UNSEEN (!!!) while a bunch of aliens walk around them (for no real reason, really... uh, sightseeing?). Firstly, it is very reminiscent of the kitchen scene in 'Jurassic Park'... and seems like a too-desperate attempt at hooking the audience. Secondly, why do they have to show us the aliens anyway? (Dull, unimaginative aliens at that!) I think it would have been much more effective to not show them at all until the final scenes. Did Spielberg forget about a great, little movie called 'Duel' where the identity of the driver of the killer truck was NEVER revealed? Did he forget how effective that was? How it added to the suspense? Spielberg's worst movie crime comes in the last 5 minutes of the movie... I won't say too much about it... just that it's totally uncalled for and it brings to mind Hooper's 'miraculous' escape at the end of 'Jaws'. It seems like Spielberg is staying firm with all his bad habits and slowly shedding all his GOOD ones. Not much to say about the acting. It's standard disaster movie emoting... Tom Cruise plays a 'bad' father (but in a kinda cute, lovable way, Dakota Fanning gets to scream and be annoying and Tim Robbins gets to play a possibly psychotic survivalist (more of that Final Act desperation I spoke of earlier). The movie's not all bad... it could have been a lot worse in less capable hands... unfortunately it also could have been a lot BETTER!",6,2,5,14 July 2005
Wedding Crashers," Charming, yeah... but kind of bland
","WEDDING CRASHERS (3 outta 5 stars) Not nearly as hilarious a movie as I was expecting... not particularly well-written but it's not the first movie for Vince Vaughn OR Owen Wilson where they had to breeze through on charm alone for two hours. Being as how the entire PLOT of this movie concerns two guys who breeze through life on charm alone, attending weddings to which they are not invited, it's not hard to see why they got they got the leads. The movie is not hard to sit through but neither is it particularly memorable once it's all over. Personally, I would have liked to get a little more information on HOW these two con artists always manage to get a seat at the dinner tables? Do they forge place cards or what? It can't just be as simple as showing up in a suit and pretending to be related to someone who isn't there. Ah well, it's a comedy... we're not meant to be concerned about how realistic it all is. We're only meant to judge how *funny* it is. Unfortunately, one week later and I hard-pressed to come up with one memorably-funny line or gag from the flick. I'm sure I was smiling amiably throughout (did I mention how dang *charming* the two leads are?) but the hilarity I was expecting just did not occur. Christopher Walken plays a Kennedy-esquire politician but it's a nothing role and it doesn't have much of the old Walken zing to it. It's like he's playing a part in a Saturday Night Live sketch that sounded promising on paper but just didn't hit the mark.",6,0,1,21 October 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Does IMDb *Really* Need Another Review Of This Movie? Well, Here It Is Anyway...
","REVENGE OF THE SITH (4 outta 5 stars) Well, the saga is complete! (At least until George Lucas or one of his heirs decides to proceed with another trilogy... oh, you KNOW it is going to happen eventually... make no mistake!) This movie is clearly the most satisfying of the 3 'prequels' to the original Star Wars... because this time out there is a clear storyline... a storyline packed with drama and action and tragedy. Annakin Skywalker's slow Macbeth-like descent into evil makes for a very compelling movie. The accent is less on things blowing up and moving really fast and more on the emotional turmoil that the characters have to go through. There is some pretty dark stuff in here... but what can you expect when the cute little boy from Episode 1 has to evolve into the black-wearing villain from Episode 4? The movie does have its weaknesses... the dialogue is particularly poor and some of the special effects are awful. (How is it that impossibly-complex spaceships can look so realistic yet a human being doing a triple flip during a sword fight can still look so utterly fake? And why can't the director see this and do something about it?) Still, the movie does have some fine moments... particularly a viciously cold-blooded final duel that almost makes up for all the stupid Jar Jar Binks comic relief that they felt compelled to cram into the first two episodes.",8,1,5,4 June 2005
The Terminal," When Spielberg Is Bad He's Very Bad...
","THE TERMINAL (2 outta 5 stars)Wow... when Spielberg goes wrong, he *really* goes wrong.  I just found this whole film so artificial and unconvincing and uninspired.  None of the supporting characters (neither their dialogue nor their actions) seem even the slightest bit real.  Yeah, yeah, it's supposed to be a 'modern day fairy tale'... well, even fairy tales need to have people in them... and not these fake representations of humanity.  It's like that stupid boy with the fishing pole in that annoying Dreamworks logo... it's a fake, idealized image of some kind of movieland childhood that never did exist in the real world.  I think this movie would have been a lot better if it wasn't being so 'cute' all the time.  The best scene is one where the head of airport security (Stanley Tucci) has to come to Tom Hanks' 'man without a country' to help him translate for a crazed, knife-wielding foreigner.  I think the relationship between Hanks and Tucci needed to be a lot more adversarial to make the movie work.  Mostly, it's on the level of Hogan against Col. Klink in the old 'Hogan's Heroes' shows.  Tucci's character is merely dislikable when he should be despised.  And Catherine Zeta-Jones?  What kind of fake, ludicrous, nonsensical hook-up is this?  What could anyone possibly see in this neurotic adulteress?   And why, oh why, do all Spielberg's latest movies have to keep going on and on after the perfect fade-out moment? Well, at least this one only goes on ten minutes too long... unlike Minority Report and A-I which went on for at least a half hour than they should have.",4,1,3,11 July 2004
Raging Bull," Just An 'Okay' Scorsese Movie
","RAGING BULL (3 outta 5 stars) You know, I gotta say it... I don't think this is one of Martin Scorsese's best. I mean, the movie is fine... it's well shot and the story is fine and the performances are good... but it just doesn't work for me like other Scorsese classics. There are some classic scenes in here... but the movie as a whole just doesn't sustain itself for over 2 hours. Robert DeNiro portrays real-life boxer Jake LaMotta and apparently gained something like 60 pounds to portray him in his declining years. Sure, he plays the character and his foibles for all they're worth... but the movie doesn't really give us any reason to care about the man. He constantly mistreats the people close to him... his brother, his wife, his girlfriend... after a while it just seems to be the same thing over and over. Certain scenes do stand out... and the fights are visually impressive... but I can watch Scorsese's best movies over and over and never feel bored. I can't say that about this particular film. But, hey, I think Scorsese's best movie is 'After Hours'... so what do I know?",6,19,33,20 February 2005
The Iron Giant," Not Just For The Kids...
","THE IRON GIANT (3+ outta 5 stars) Fantastic animated movie about a young boy who forges a friendship with a giant metal robot that comes from outer space. It's the '50s and people are a little paranoid about all things being Communist plots... so his existence has to be kept a secret... especially when a zealous government agent comes to town and starts to believe some of the weird stories he keeps hearing about giant metal men. A convenient metal scrapyard run by a friendly Beatnik provides a great hiding place... but can he stay hidden when the US military comes out in full force to find him? Very well-done story... with a conclusion guaranteed to bring a tear to your eye. Voices provided by Vin Diesel (as the Giant), Jennifer Aniston (as the boy's single, working mom), M. Emmett Walsh, John Mahoney and Harry Connick, Jr. as The Beatnik). Written and directed by Brad Bird who has since gone on to bring 'The Incredibles' to the screen.",7,1,3,11 February 2005
The Producers," Springtiiiiiiiiiiiime For Hitlerrrrrrrrr and Germanyyyyyyyyyyyyy
","THE PRODUCERS (4 outta 5 stars)Incredibly bizarre debut comedy film from Mel Brooks. The premise might not seem as shocking today as I'm sure it did when the film first came out (the creation of a Broadway musical about Adolph Hitler)... but the dark humour is still as potent now as was then. Zero Mostel is the down-and-out producer of failed shows who has sunk to the level of seducing old ladies for money. Gene Wilder is the emotionally dysfunctional accountant who stumbles upon the idea that more money could be made by producing a 'flop' show than a 'hit'. So Mostel and Wilder gather up the lousiest writer, director and actors they can and hope for the worst. But, of course, things don't quite turn out as planned. I swear, once you've heard it you won't be able to get 'Springtime for Hitler' out of your head. The open audition for the lead role of Hitler is one of the funniest sequences ever. Wilder makes such an impression with his wildly manic role that I can't even begin to imagine how Matthew Broderick could do it justice. (Guess I'll just have to wait for the upcoming musical re-make.) 'I'm hysterical... and I'm WET!'",8,0,0,21 November 2004
Fantastic Four," I Wish I Liked... Or Hated... This Movie More
","FANTASTIC FOUR (2+ outta 5 stars) I suppose this movie isn't as terrible as it looks on the surface (and believe me, to anyone familiar with the comic book in its heyday, it does *look* terrible) but it's nowhere near as good a movie as it could been. The main problem is that they have a villain, Doctor Doom, but he doesn't have much motivation... and he doesn't even have any kind of evil plan to take over the world or anything. So he becomes the archvillain of the Fantastic Four because... he's kind of a jerk? He's not threatening to blow up the city? Or planning to murder thousands of innocent people? There is some kind of half-baked subplot where he and Reed Richards are both seeking the affections of Sue Storm but there is no real tension there... it's not even believable for a second that Sue could ever have been serious about a vain jackass like Doom... and Doom hardly seems capable of the kind of passion that could make this kind of romantic tug-of-war interesting. Yeah, these three characters are all wash-outs compared to the comic book versions. Fortunately, Mike Chiklis as The Thing and Chris Evans as The Human Torch are pretty faithful to the comic book characters and they have some good on screen chemistry. The Thing's dilemma (he is the only one of the four who takes the form of a 'monster' and can't turn his power off and on at will) is handled very well... I wish we could have seen even more of his developing relationship with blind girl Alicia. Johnny Storm is a loudmouth, risk-taking fame-seeker and, since everyone else is so deadly-serious all the time, he gets all the best lines. The movie has a few moments... but the story has no real momentum and the big finale is about as senseless a movie fight as you will ever see. And what's with four heroes ganging up on one lousy villain? I thought the Jedis were wimps because they are always ganging up on the bad guys two-on-one... now we have FOUR against one? They just so much less heroic doing that...",5,0,1,23 July 2005
Sin City," More Parody Than Pastiche
","SIN CITY (4 outta 5 stars) Sin City is a very amusing film... a sampling of some of Frank Miller's Sin City comics some time ago never gave me an inkling that it was supposed to be *funny*. It always struck me as a slavish, fan-obsessed regurgitation of Mickey Spillane (with the gritty realism eschewed in favor of whatever bizarre costumes or weaponry Miller felt like drawing that day). The movie of Sin City seems to be more of a parody of those film noir clichés than a mere pastiche. It's funny... but without being overly silly. The movie is made up of three separate 'stories' all of which follow the same essential pattern: big, brawny guys getting beaten up and repeatedly shot in order to protect a dame. The movie is very anti-PC... men are men and women are babes and the only real love can be between a man and a little girl. These subtexts that run through pretty much ALL of modern 'tough guy' fiction are mercilessly trounced by the deliberately ham-fisted dialogue and overwrought situations that make up this film. It's the performances that really sell this concept though. Mickey Rourke in particularly makes the most outrageous pulp dialogue sound like poetry as it wafts from his rough-hewn voice-box. Clive Owen and Bruce Willis also add subtle dimensions to their own takes on the same character. Benicio Del Toro and Michael Clarke Duncan have some of the greatest villainous voices ever heard in film. (And it's particularly nice that Del Toro's character is still heard from even after his demise.) The women of 'Sin City' are basically eye candy... but somehow Carla Gugino, Rosario Dawson, Alexis Bledel and even Jessica Alba are able to come across as more than just pin-up girls. Interesting direction by Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino (who did what? who knows?). I had doubts about the over-use of digital effects to beef up the action... but with a couple of exceptions (where the on screen action looked like bad video game graphics) the CGI worked pretty well.",8,4,8,2 April 2005
Goodfellas," One of the Greatest Gangster Epics of All Time
","GOODFELLAS (5 outta 5 stars)I remember thinking, when this movie came out 'Oh, here goes Scorsese again... another Italian gangster movie... ho hum... small role for DeNiro... big deal.'  Was I ever wrong!  My low expectations were completely turned upside down by this epic, sprawling masterpiece.  What it has taken 'The Sopranos' 4 seasons and umpteen hours to portray... 'Goodfellas' gets it all done in just over 2 and 1/2.  Ray Liotta portrays Henry Hill, a punk kid from a good family who gets in tight with the local mob, rising up in their ranks by robbing, killing and dealing drugs... until his inevitable fall.  Terrific cast of memorable characters (a lot of whom may not have been famous at the time but are certainly more well-known now)!  Rivetting storyline... practically every scene is a classic.  Very funny scenes interspersed with shockingly violent brutality.  Director Martin Scorsese was firing on all cylinders this time out... not a dull moment or a slack scene to be found.  Robert DeNiro has probably the least interesting character to play in this movie... and look what he does with it!  Amazing! Bonus points to Paul Sorvino who has his best screen role ever.  Don't miss this one!",10,0,0,23 August 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," Spy Movies Haven't Been This Cool Since The '60s
","THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (3+ outta 5 stars) Nifty follow-up to 'The Bourne Identity', one of the best action-thrillers to come out in recent years. Even though these movies don't skimp on excitement they also provide plenty of story and character development so that you don't feel you're being bombarded with one idiotic action sequence after another. The storyline isn't quite as gripping as the first... at times it seems to be just repeating itself... but ultimately the movie proves itself to be a worthy successor, thanks to the performances (Matt Damon as Bourne, Brian Cox as the head of a super-secret US spy agency... and the addition of Joan Allen as a determined investigator determined to track down and neutralize Bourne). Franka Potente doesn't have as much to do this time around... but Julia Stiles gets one especially intense scene that shows off her acting skills to the max. Yes, when you get right down to it the movie has a sense of 'been there, done that' about it... but not very often are movies of this type done with this kind of skill and dedication... spy movies haven't been this cool since the '60s.",7,83,165,11 February 2005
