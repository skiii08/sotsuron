Iron Man 3," watch it again, trust me
","You need to watch it again because there are more surprises that you didn't understand the first time you watched it, you also understand and appreciate it more. Love RDJ he is really good and performs better in this iron man than the first two, Iron man 3 is better than Iron man 2 but not better than the first. Guy Pearce has a good role in this movie as well as Killian a villain in the movie. i find also that it was funny more than i even expected to be. its also a different feel to the first two iron man movies this is good as well because its not becoming repetitive and boring. i also like the composing in the movie by Brian Tyler who performs an amazing score for the movie to suit the mood.go watch it again.",8,0,4,6 May 2013
