Blade Runner 2049," Got mixed feelings about
","If short, you like original then you will like sequel.Actually, it's roughly at the same, let's say, 'phylosophical' level original is. It have great ambiance as original have, it have it's own distinct style,it's definitely new Bladerunner. That is it. No more, no less.I would like to compare with new Ghost in the Shell and original one. Sequel is a parody (honestly to be said) to original with plot made for popcorn experience. New Bladerunner is not.Deserves to watch? Definitely.",8,1,7,5 October 2017
Gravity," Waste of time, watch only in cinema,
","First I can't recommend to anybody to watch this movie outside of cinema (and better do it with pretty girl!) or if you have something similar at your home or if you have a pretty girl near (movie is boring, but she would be delight). Because all the good things in that movie are visual effects. Yes, I know movies shall make money while sacrificing realism and other stuff. In this case it's tooooooooooo much commercial, even by space measurements. If you are a kinda freak about all the things about space (like me) then you will find out this movie is a... waste of time. I will not be talking about all the mistakes this movie consists, when you are watching this movie you are like 'Ha-ha, what a ...!' or 'Unbelievable! What a silly man did came up with that?!' Seriously, there is even no story... What? Bunch of Russian retards strikes (what kind of weapon?) their satellite (WHY? AHAHA) and blablabla is not a story at all. Only that debris and various parts rushing towards your 3D glasses. Watch in cinema with girl, or do not watch. But don't forget about girl.",5,1,5,11 August 2015
Aliens," I've got bad news for you... if you like it
","I wonder how it got 8 stars... No-no! I am not a fan and I've dispassionately checked '2' from combobox just because this movie is really awful. Why? OK. Here we go! Creating science fiction (SCIENCE!) movie has to be fantasy based on reality, not on unrestrained minds of writers or your 5-year old son. So, what we've got here? Story sucks and don't tell me it's OK, it's just... cant describe how bad it is. Ah, OK, not bad for five year old boy! Characters sucks. For example marines are defective imbeciles, not a soldiers. Screenplay is awful: cliché, cliché, cliché... omg, so many clichés (yes, I know it's '86). But it's OK for 80-90 minutes... It's 137 minutes long. 'Daddy asked me to let you all know that the theatre is closing. We are all being sick!'",2,7,25,15 August 2015
The Martian," Terrible
","First of all: you can ignore this review, dislike or do whatever you want. If you like to eat dung — go ahead, I don't give a single wikipedia (it and other sources of info was completely ignored by writers) or google images (that full of pictures made by rovers) about.After Prometheus I though it was the real bottom of Ridley Scott. Now we've got even more awful movie The Martian. I've got a feeling Scott is pursuing objective to make the most terrible sci-fi movie. And challenge continues! Wait for sequel to sequel to Aliens, Alien: Paradise Lost. P.S.: Even more there is a rip-off from Gravity in the end.",2,7,27,11 October 2015
