The Blair Witch Project," Not Scary As Hell (But Still Good)
","A film with an original idea is always welcome and The BWP certainly scores well in originality.  The movie is not so much scary as it is creepy. Kudos to the writers and actors who make the film very believable.  The ending kinda stinks, but it leaves room for a sequel.  By the way, I love that mouth on Heather Donohue.",8,0,1,26 October 1999
Blade Runner 2049," Better than the original. Still not great
","I should start off by saying I was NOT a fan of the original Blade Runner. I loved the dystopian world and the concept of replicants but found the movie very poorly pulled off. Because of this, I was looking at the sequel with hope that it would improve on the original. I would say that it does for the most part. The cinematography is excellent and the story does provoke thought about human vs artificial life. The best acting is done by the supporting cast. Harrison Ford pretty much sleepwalks through it. I also laugh at the concept that Earth would be so different in only 30 years!!! Flying cars. Perfect replicants. Environmental catastrophe. They may unfortunately be in this planets future, but 2049 seems too soon. The title should've been Blade Runner 2149. All in all I rate it a 7 out of 10. Good but not great",6,1,6,14 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as deep as the prior 3, but still a heck of a wild ride
","NO, Episode 1 will not be the cultural phenomenon of the original trilogy, but ,on its own merits, it is a fine action picture with some of the best fx ever put on film.  Jar Jar was not as bad as I was led to believe and Darth Maul was awesome.  The lack of development of the Darth Maul character is in fact my biggest criticism of the movie.  There was an opportunity to make him an all-time great villain, like Vader, but this was impossible because his role was limited only to action sequences. Still an 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,28 June 1999
Se7en," Beats Silence of the Lambs by miles
","This film (along with Copycat) sets the standard for engrossing serial-killer flicks.  Freeman and Spacey are typically excellent, but Brad Pitt surprises with an excellent performance himself.  A thinking-man's psycho film. 9 out of 10 stars *********",9,0,1,19 July 1999
Memento," Decent, not a 10 though.
","Memento is an original idea in filmmaking, but it doesn't provide a satisfying end.  The story builds up to a point where the audience is expecting a major climax, but it never happens.  That lack of a finale makes the journey much less rewarding in hindsight.  5 out of 10 stars.",3,2,3,1 October 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Good movie, let's not get carried away though
","Acting was decent, though I was expecting more of the Jack Sparrow character after reading all of the reviews.  Special effects were good too.  This was certainly a visually stunning film.  Overall a 7 out of 10.",3,1,2,4 December 2003
Us," Plot holes galore, but not boring
","I think the rating average for this movie is accurate. Around a 6 or 7. The plot holes are enormous. Basically the whole background for the story is completely glossed over, but Peele's films are not boring. They keep you interested throughout and that was the case here too. If you are looking for a nice diversion, check this movie out, but leave your rational mind at the door.",6,2,2,2 December 2019
The Irishman," Good but not one of the greats on the mob
","The film is well-acted, but the lack of energy from the older cast is palpable despite CGI. The story is not particularly gripping either. Kinda like a Forrest Gump mob style. It's worth a look, but it is not in the class of great mob films like: Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed, Carlito's Way, or Donnie Brasco.",7,3,3,9 January 2020
The Mummy," Great FX, weak acting, good if you like Egyptology
","The Mummy is a decent action movie with great special fx.  While the plot is a bore, the visual tapestry unfolding before you will be worth your while. It wasn't as good as Congo (which is by no means a great movie) but was better than the Matrix.  My big problem with the film is Hollywood's penchant for demeaning people of Arab and Middle Eastern descent.  It seems like they are the only group of people (besides the Nazis) that it is safe to ridicule.",7,0,0,5 October 1999
The Day After Tomorrow," On my all time dumbest movies list
",One of the most bogus films ever made. The plot is laughable. Climate and weather are not the same thing !!!,1,2,8,17 March 2018
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino's best
","Loved this film. I can't recall seeing too many movies as long as this one where I was never bored at some point. Unlike Pulp Fiction which had some iconic awesome scenes along with other scenes that dragged on, this one is always interesting. The characters and dialogue are terrific and you have no idea how things will end. 10 out of 10.",10,0,2,15 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Lazy filmmaking
","You have a huge budget and a ton of lore to build on and the result is this???? This film, like the two before it, has no place in the Star Wars universe. Just trotting out beloved characters with no discernible plot is the mess you get. I give it a 7 for special fx ONLY.",7,5,10,10 June 2020
Armageddon," Worst movie of the year
","This dud was clearly one of the worst movies of the year. Forget the inconceivable premise of flying oil rig drillers into space to save the world (I'd think it would be easier to teach astronauts to drill than vice-versa), the testosterone level of the plot and script are way too high and serve to destroy any semblance of fear or tension about the impending destruction of Earth. Between the depressing Deep Impact and this turkey, I hope Hollywood will give the asteroid impact plot a rest for a few years.",1,1,3,21 November 1998
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Very entertaining film
","The Gov does a nice job as do the other actors.  Special effects and stunts were good.  Her-minator wasn't as menacing as Robert Patrick's T2 version, but the ending was quite good... not a typical Hollywood ending.",8,0,0,3 December 2003
American Beauty," Good solid well-acted film
","This movie has it all, which may be considered good or bad by some.  It certainly is hysterically funny at times while grim and depressing at others.  Kevin Spacey is typically excellent.  This role cements his status as one of the top 2 or 3 actors around right now.",7,0,0,22 October 1999
Tropic Thunder," Horrible movie
","I haven't logged into my account for awhile, but I had to to warn folks from renting this crap. It is utterly unfunny drivel. I don't know how someone as talented as Tom Cruise would've wanted to take part in this mess. I have always found Ben Stiller to be very unfunny and this is no different. Robert Downey, I can't understand a damn thing you are saying. I understand and can appreciate crude humor, good examples of this are Dumb & Dumber and Clerks, but this film is not even in their league. Beyond being politically incorrect, the main issue I have is that the film is JUST NOT FUNNY. It is borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring. No more Ben Stiller movies in my Netflix queue.",1,0,1,30 December 2008
Independence Day," The FX can't save this awful movie
","Wow, it's incredible how a poorly written movie cannot be saved by a billion dollars worth of effects.  I saw this movie again for the 2nd time after it first came out thinking that it might trigger some interest the 2nd time around. NO!!!  The script and characters are just a joke.  Besides Bill Pullman all the other characters are just scenery adding nothing to the plot.  This movie is just a rip-off of the superior NBC miniseries V of the mid-80's.",6,0,2,8 October 1999
The Favourite," Surprised me
","I'm not the type who typically goes for period pieces, but the Favourite is not your typical one. It is never boring at any point and is well done in every detail. The 3 female leads are all excellent, but the character Mr Harley steals the show. Highly recommended.",8,2,4,9 December 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A very good action flick with some minor flaws
","The Lost World is a respectable follow-up to JP. It follows most of the rules for a successful sequel, i.e. more action, more dinos, etc.  The sequel could not possibly capture the awe of the original so they correctly flooded us with dazzling effects.  Sure the storyline is weak, but there was not much more they could have done as far as the overall plot line.  The worst part of this movie is clearly the presence of Malcolm's annoying daughter.  Forget that a movie about genetically engineered dinosaurs fails to account for the racial discrepancy between father and daughter, whenever the Kelly character is on screen bad things happen, culminating with her gymnastic routine where her 80 lb body drives a 600 lb velociraptor out the window like a cannon.  Nevertheless, good performances by V. Vaughn, J. Moore, and P. Postlewaite plus those dazzling dinos save the day.",8,0,0,22 June 1999
Get Out," Entertaining, unusual. Not great though.
","This is a hard one to review. It WAS entertaining for the most part and was disturbing in a comical way. It was by no means great. I'm not sure what the awards buzz around this film is about, but it was with seeing. I think the film it most reminds me of is Don McKay. I give it a 6 out of 10.",5,0,0,1 April 2018
Ex Machina," Wow. What a great film.
","Atmospheric, thought-provoking, well acted and directed. This film was terrific. I loved every minute of it. A definite sci fi movie for adults with adult themes. Definitely a must see!!!",10,2,3,4 February 2020
Children of Men," Well done dystopic film
","Children of Men is well crafted movie with solid acting from its lead characters. The background story is light in detail as to why man has become sterilized, but it takes the concept forward well and is very thought provoking. The cinematography is quite good and the battle scenes at the end are intense and visceral. I rate it a solid 8 out of 10.",8,2,3,6 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Running out of ideas
",I watch these new Star Wars films with the full realization that these are just cash grabs. New story lines are just muddled rehashing that lower the overall quality of the franchise. The feminist agenda is also very clear here too and seems to be the only purpose of this latest set of movies. Yet another 100 lb waifish model kicking everyone's butt. Puhleeze.I rate it a 7 for special FX. But I will never consider episodes 7-9 as real Star Wars movies.,7,2,9,7 June 2020
From Dusk Till Dawn," What might have been.....
",A terrific build up and then .... wham a 180 degree plot twist that really sucks. It's a lost opportunity with such an excellent cast. Still it is entertaining and Salma Hayek is smoking hot!!!,6,1,1,2 February 2020
Mission: Impossible II," With a different director this story had a chance
","The film had good actors, a decent story, and beautiful locales, unfortunately John Woo's over-the-top style ruins the whole effort.  Those ridiculous gravity-defying action sequences detract from the story.  I'll take a good real-life stunt over those effect stunts anyday ( I mean full body motorcycle jousting, c'mon ).Four out of ten stars. ****",5,0,1,5 February 2001
Everest," Borrring as heck
",One of the most boring movies ever. Can't believe how a story as compelling could be pulled off so poorly. Had to just quit halfway through. 1 out of 10.,1,4,7,16 March 2018
There's Something About Mary," BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!
","I was expecting one of the funniest movies ever, but laughs were very rare. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for something really hilarious to happen, but it never did.  Dumb and Dumber was hilarious from the very start when Jim Carrey drove up to the Austrian girl and said G'day Mate.  This movie sorely missed the comic talent of Carrey or even Jeff Daniels.  This was basically a Chris Elliott movie, see Cabin Boy for details.",2,0,0,11 February 1999
Total Recall," The Best Sci-Fi Movie Ever
","A Sci-Fi film made exclusively with adults in mind, what a concept! Paul Verhoeven spy thriller set in space is one of the most thoroughly enjoyable movies ever made. The action is terrific, the special-effects are excellent, and the characters (while not deep in scope) are nevertheless very interesting and help to keep the pace of the script tight. Ahnuld puts forth his best performance as an actor, Sharon Stone was never more sexy, Michael Ironsides essentially plays the 'Ham Tyler' role he played in the mini-series V (in which he was fabulous), and Ronny Cox plays a great SOB bad guy. The visual appeal of the film is undeniable and the pace of the action make it a Thrill Ride of Your Life.",10,0,1,12 January 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Classic Kubrick
","Eyes Wide Shut is classic Kubrick.  If you don't get Kubrick, you'll hate it, if you do get Kubrick you'll like it.  It's as simple as that.  The plot is incidental to the journey he takes you on within your own psyche (this time exploring the nature of sexual attraction).  Tom and Nicole do a fine job, the cinematography is terrific, and the atmosphere of the film is all-enveloping.  A cinematic treat which I rate an 8 out of 10 stars ********",9,0,1,29 March 2000
Jaws," ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
","Wake me up when this film gets interesting.  All the talk about this film made me watch it for the first time.  I only made it half-way before literally falling asleep.  Sharks aren't frightening if you have enough sense to stay out of the water, plus the negative stereotypes perpetuated by this film probably killed more sharks than can be imagined.  A predator is a predator, nature needs them films probably don't though.",1,16,100,2 August 1999
Prometheus," From hate to love - my journey with Prometheus
",I have to admit that the first time I saw Prometheus I thought it was just awful. After viewing Alien Covenant where the story is expanded upon I decided to see this movie again. I don't know what I must've thought. Prometheus is actually a very interesting and well done movie. I think having the context of its sequel answered a lot of questions about this movie. Admittedly there are still some gaping holes esp those regarding what the motivations of the Engineers really was at the beginning of the movie juxtaposed to the end. Nevertheless I found this thoroughly enjoyable and have already rewatched it multiple times and enjoyed it even more. I would give it a strong 8 out of 10,10,3,5,15 March 2018
The Truman Show," No Oscar Nominations, what a jip
","No, this isn't the greatest film ever, but it is one of the most original. Jim Carrey and Ed Harris are great and definitely deserve Oscar nods. The movie starts off kinda slow, but in the second half you become totally engrossed with Trumans flight to freedom.  No matter how large or beautiful a prison is, it is still a prison.",7,0,0,9 February 1999
The Matrix," OVERRATED
","A nice premise is ruined by a plot that never settles down and decides what it is going to be.  The first 1/2 of the movie builds nicely, but the last 1/2 is just mindless action with no direction.  The phony fight scenes were out of a Mortal Combat video game.  If karate was so essential to the movie they should've gotten Jackie Chan to do it.",7,1,3,23 September 1999
Godzilla," Awful dreck
","I can't believe someone could mess up a Godzilla movie, but they did. The older movie with Matthew Broderick is much better than this snoozefest. Don't waste your time.",1,1,2,16 March 2018
Green Book," Worthy Oscar winner
","Great acting, great script with important social commentary. What else can you ask for in an Oscar winning film? Oh yeah it's never dull and quite funny at times. Great film.",8,4,6,9 February 2020
Jackie Brown," One of the year's best
","I loved this film. Tarantino strikes again. While this is an altogether different film from Pulp Fiction, it's still great (to me even a little better). Once again the selling point is the excellent dialogue and acting. Samuel L. Jackson proves he's definitely one of the best actors around as long as he stays out of the water (see the dreadful SPHERE for details). Pam Grier is also very believable in her role and deserves more opportunities in the future. For anyone who likes acting over special effects, this film's a bag full of stacks of cash.",8,0,1,27 November 1998
The Bourne Supremacy," Best movie of 2004
","One of the best spy action movies to come along in a long time. Great action and stunts,great locations, and fine acting (Joan Allen was superb). She might deserve a supporting-actress nod for this turn. The plot holds together very nicely. Overall it was much better than the Bourne Identity.The car chase scene in Moscow is first rate. The fight in the German home is as good as it gets.I still think Matt Damon is a stretch for this role, but I have to give him credit for pulling it off.I rate it 9 out of 10 stars. Definitely buy this movie. *********",10,3,4,28 December 2004
