The Young Victoria," emily blunt
","I first became aware of Emily Blunt in the film MY SUMMER OF LOVE. Obviously a strikingly beautiful young woman, Ms. Blunt is a remarkable actress. The camera loves her and the way she uses her eyes is singularly unique among many actresses. I know that i am not going out on a limb to say with Ms Blunt its a matter of not if she will win an Academy Award but a matter of when. Patting myself on the back i also saw that same quality in Natalie Portman in the movie THE PROFESSIONAL and Amy Adams in the movie CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. There is something different about Ms Blunt though. Of course her looks are a factor but having said that i cant take my eyes off her while she is on screen which is the hallmark of extraordinary talent.",7,1,1,8 February 2011
