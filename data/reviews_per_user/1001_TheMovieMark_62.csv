The Avengers," 'So awesome.' Why be loquacious, when two such honestly efficient words will do?
","'So awesome.' Those were the first two words that came to mind as I scoured my brain in an effort to find a fitting description of what I had just witnessed. Why be loquacious, when two such honestly efficient words will do? Come on, what else do you want me to say? The Avengers hits the ground in overdrive, downs a six-pack of energy drinks, and rarely takes a breath during the course of its purely entertaining 142 minute runtime.Burdened with a glorious purpose, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) makes his presence known quickly. He comes to earth to rule and leaves Nick Fury (Samuel L. 'Snakes on a Plane' Jackson) and his awesome eyepatch with no choice but to revisit the failed Avengers Initiative. The film recognizes that there are a lot of male egos that need clashing and thus wastes no time in delivering exactly what the audience wants to see â€“ 2+ hours of superhero bliss.As intense and exhilarating as the climactic 40+ minute battle against Loki and his minions is, the hero vs. hero, alpha male vs. alpha male build up is even better. Captain America vs. Thor. Iron Man vs. Thor. Thor vs. Hulk. Hawkeye vs. Black Widow. Come on now. I think I even saw a kitchen sink in there battling it out. Director Joss Whedon clearly thought through the scenarios that fans would want and he flawlessly delivers them with style. A little panache, if you will. Executing the individual battles in a way that does justice to the characters is not an easy task, but the special effects and 7.1 Surround Sound are crafted to perfection.If you've seen the individual Avenger movies then you know exactly what to expect from the characters. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) cracks wise with his sarcastic humor, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) cracks heads with his magic hammer, Captain America (Chris Evans) cracks nary a smile with his old-school, no-nonsense patriotism, and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), well, he just smashes.Add Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the former Russian assassin, and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), a master with the bow and arrow, to the mix and that is a whole lot of superheroes demanding a limited amount of screen time. The good news is Whedon handles this potential problem seamlessly, giving everybody ample time to do their thing and play their part. The biggest surprise, both literally and figuratively, has to be The Hulk. Not only is this the most 'realistic' version of the beloved green rage monster that's been delivered to the big screen, but he simply steals every scene he's in.The Avengers is the kind of roller coaster thrill ride of a movie that takes me back to the magic I felt as a kid every time I walked into the theater and sat down to watch a much-anticipated Summer blockbuster. It's a refreshing blend of humor and action that lets you check out of your reality for a couple of hours and check into an exciting world where good triumphs evil and it does so in marvelously inventive ways.If you can't enjoy The Avengers then I fear you simply can't enjoy life. Shoot me an email and we'll see if we can't introduce some joy into your world.",10,2,6,4 May 2012
Walk the Line," Enjoyable, even if you're not a fan of Cash's music
","'I'm pretty sure those weren't Johnny Cash's original recordings, so I wonder who did the vocals?' Stephanie, a bigger Cash fan than I, posed the question after the movie. She was duly impressed when I informed her that Phoenix did all of Cash's vocals with no dubbing.It serves as a testament to Joaquin's dedication to the role. In addition to performing the vocals, he also learned to play the guitar from scratch. And lest we take anything away from Ms. Witherspoon, she performed her own vocals as well and had to learn the auto harp. Maybe this won't impress some of you as much as it does me, but I thought it went a long way in adding a more personal touch that a biography such as this needs to succeed.Another thing that a biography needs to succeed is an ability to condense one man's entire life into a two hour timeframe. How do you take the life of a country music legend and effectively tell a story of family turmoil, military service, music success, drugs, infidelity, and redemption all within such a short amount of time? I don't know, but I recommend you watch Walk the Line for an example of how it can be done.I expect Joaquin to be listening for his name on Oscar night. He puts in such a believable performance that you don't have to be a fan of Cash's music to be interested in his story. We see from the beginning that the traumatic death of Cash's older brother will never cease haunting him. But it's Joaquin that really shows us how this dreadful memory won't allow him peace. His father wishes it was he that the devil took, his wife never seems to fully embrace his career or the fact that he has to live on the road so often, and the road itself contributes to his dependence on drugs.Indeed Cash becomes a man who can't resist temptation.Ironically, it's one of those temptations that eventually becomes his savior - June Carter, portrayed so smoothly by Reese Witherspoon that I won't be surprised if she too will be listening for her name on Oscar night. As the relationship between Cash and Carter develops, the movie shifts from the chronicle of one man's life into a genuine love story. It's not until he risks losing her love that he realizes life can be a failure despite whatever success might come.Consequently, Walk the Line has something to offer audiences that don't wear black dusters and kicker boots. But those who are most interested in the musical aspect of Cash's journey will go home satisfied. I particularly enjoyed watching the correlation between Cash's life experiences and how they influenced his songwriting. Keep a close eye on the scene where Cash strolls the streets of Memphis and watches as a young boy and his dad rhythmically shine shoes and then later on listen closely when Cash sings his hit Get Rhythm. Subtlety reigns supreme, but it's clear enough to give us a glimpse of the man's process.Younger audiences that don't warmly embrace biopics may not find themselves enthralled with Walk the Line, but anyone who likes a good character study or a true-to-life love story should be thoroughly entertained.",7,1,3,23 November 2005
Lucky Number Slevin," Don't let the title turn you off.
","The law of retaliation. It's the primary law that New York crime bosses live by, at least according to Lucky Number Slevin. Unfortunately for Josh 'Squinty-Eyed' Hartnett, a case of mistaken identity drags him right into the middle of this law in motion.'Lucky Number Slevin? Come on, Johnny! That's the stupidest title ever! And Josh 'Wooden Boy' Hartnett?' I know, I know. I thought the exact same thing when I originally heard the title. 'What kind of lame attempt at being clever through the use of a silly pun is this?' I thought to myself. But the title actually makes sense within the context of the film. To say anymore would reveal too much of a major plot element, but it's a moment where you'll say, 'Ah, I get it now. OK, that's not so bad.' And seriously, I want you to use that exact quote so I don't look silly.'Too late!' Gee, thanks. As for Hartnett, I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a charter member of his fan club. I typically hold him as the standard bearer when I need a reference point for listless, unemotional acting. But the guy gives it his sarcastic best here and delivers the most likable character I've seen him portray.It doesn't hurt that he's surrounded by a strong cast of actors playing a variety of entertaining, eccentric characters. Lucy Liu is cute and inquisitive. Bruce Willis is a hit-man who you truly believe is a stone cold killer. Morgan Freeman dares the audience to still like him considering the fact that he's a crime boss. And Ben Kingsley, after a huge slump of horrific movies (A Sound of Thunder, BloodRayne) finally gets quality material to work with.As much as I enjoyed the quirky characters, what really won me over is the movie's slightly complex and somewhat unpredictable plot. Following the nonlinear storytelling of Lock Stock-era Ritchie, Slevin sets up the basic premise and then the audience watches as the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. You may be able to figure out where everything is headed by the halfway point, but it's still fun to watch how it gets there.You may also be able to find a plot hole or two if you look hard enough, but I enjoyed the film too much to worry about such silly nitpicking. If you're one of those spoilsports who brings your industrial-sized nitpicker to every movie with you just so you can find things to complain about then just stay home and let everybody else watch it in peace.I can understand the argument that some of the dialogue feels a little contrived in an effort to appear clever, but it didn't bother me. I can recognize the humor in lines such as, 'Tell it to the one-legged man so he can bump it down the road,' and character reactions to quotes like this reveal that it isn't written to be pretentious, just knowingly different.If you're looking for a recent comparison then I'd say Slevin has a similar feel to 2005's highly entertaining Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Though Slevin isn't as consistently funny, it employs a similar dark comedy style and I think it has the better story and more satisfying ending of the two.If you're not easily offended then you might want to check out Lucky Number Slevin. Be warned: there are a couple of quick, gratuitous sex scenes at the beginning of the movie that feel thrown in just for the sake of pleasing the 'perverted male' demographic, but as far as style goes we need more movies like this that put forth a little extra effort to be cooler, more clever, and smarter than their peers.THE GIST If you like movies with quirky characters and a complicated plot that requires you to willingly keep everything straight in your head as you follow along then Lucky Number Slevin certainly will entertain.",8,4,13,7 April 2006
The Longest Yard," Entertaining, but not one of Sandler's best.
","What exactly is The Longest Yard? Is it merely a movie that follows the adventures of an imprisoned former NFL quarterback as he assembles a rag tag group of hardened criminals into a football team and then prepares them to play against a team consisting of the prison guards? Or is it a lesson in breaking the laws of physics? After all, a yard is a yard, correct? How can any one yard be longer than another? It's impossible, right? Well, yes, but the movie never addresses the issue. So we'll accept this as a football comedy.But is it more than a comedy? Is it a warning about us as a society? Honestly, what is it about our human nature that causes us to cheer on a football team consisting of convicted murderers and probably even rapists? Sure, the prison guards are painted in a negative light, but is that reason enough to root for a group of criminals? Is this Adam Sandlerized social commentary? No, of course not. But unfortunately, the movie does seem to have a slight identity crisis at times. Overall, this is a fun, entertaining movie. The action and jokes come at us fast amidst the backdrop of classic rock. That's all well and good, but I was a little dismayed that things were more dramatic than I expected. Plus, the third act focused mainly on the football game.I enjoyed watching the big hits, the dropkicks, and the clotheslines, but it's just one of those things where once you watch the game and see how it plays out, there's not much incentive to go back and watch it again. The laughs are sufficient, but the movie simply doesn't measure up to Sandler's best comedies.My enjoyment also waned a little whenever the movie dipped into 'least common denominator' humor territory. I suppose some people will laugh uproariously at the prisoners who are dressed as women and posing as cheerleaders. These people are whom I like to refer to as 'the easily entertained.' But I guess I'm just one of those guys who doesn't really enjoy looking at men in skimpy outfits grinding against each other. If the thought of a scantily clad, transvestite Tracy Morgan makes you as sick as it does me, then keep your trusty yellow bucket handy.I was also hoping Sandler wouldn't be quite so subdued. He's still funny, but things get a little awkward when he turns into Mr. Conflicted Emotions and plays the hero. That's nice, Adam, but can't you talk in a funny voice at least a couple of times? No? Fine. Whatever, Mr. Forget Your Niche.Oh well, I guess I just come from the Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer school of Adam Sandler comedies, so I was a little disappointed that The Longest Yard wasn't in the same vein. It's still pretty entertaining, but darn it all, I want to know which yard is the longest, and I want to see the proof! I still say all yards are the same. That's what sequels are for, I suppose. Man I'm a dork.THE GIST To be completely honest, The Longest Yard can wait for a DVD rental, especially if you're on the fence about it. It's not like there are any great special effects that just have to be seen on the big screen. Entertaining? Yes, but I won't be adding it to my DVD collection. Worth $8+ per person? Nah. Make it a rental or a matinÃ©e.",7,2,10,27 May 2005
Dawn of the Dead," Better than the original
","Personally, I can go either way in regard to zombie movies.  For example, I liked 'Resident Evil,' but '28 Days Later' bored me to tears.  Well, not literally, but it was close.  Actually, I think I yawned so wide once that a tear DID come out of my eye.  I still don't know why '28 Days Later' was as hyped as it was.  The movie started off at a decent pace (for about 5 minutes), but it stopped to catch its breath and NEVER GOT STARTED AGAIN! 'Dawn of the Dead' is the movie that '28 Days Later' should've been.'Dawn of the Dead' is classified as a 'remake,' but it's not really that similar to the original.  A more accurate statement would be to say it's 'based on' the original.  Unlike the original (and I know I'm gonna catch flak for this), this movie is actually entertaining.  And by 'entertaining' I mean it's a movie that didn't put me to sleep and have me wondering when it'd be over.  I honestly don't know why so many people love the original so much.  I hear people praise the 'social commentary' in it.  Whatever.  The movie was slow-paced, boring, cheesy, had bad acting, and had even worse music.  I didn't dig it at all.The 'remake,' however, is much more fast-paced.  Zombies are being run over, shot, and blown up at a pretty rapid clip.  I don't know about the average zombie movie mark, but that's what I want to see in a zombie movie!  If that kind of stuff bothers you or makes you squeamish, then this isn't for you.THE GIST:If you love zombie movies that will lull you to sleep and try to impress you with false pretenses of social commentary, then check out '28 Days Later.' However, if you like your zombie movies with blood, gore, fast-moving zombies, a good amount of tension, and a little humor mixed in, then 'Dawn of the Dead' will keep you entertained.P.S. Stay for the closing credits.",Null,0,1,15 June 2004
Two for the Money," A sampling of the ugliness of the sports gambling life ensues...
","Networks can't talk about it. The government can't tax it. Yet sports betting is a $200 billion a year business. A business that strives to exploit every vulnerability, manipulate every gullibility, and convince the client that it can provide them certainty in an uncertain world.Two for the Money is the story of one man's journey into the sports gambling world. Matthew McConaughey delivers one of his more impressive performances as he transforms from Brandon Lang, the smooth-talking golden boy, into John Anthony - 'The Million Dollar Man with the Billion Dollar Plan.' A transformation that comes complete with a new suit, a new car, a new attitude, and slicked back hair - a sure-fire movie sign that corruption or a loss of innocence is imminent.Portraying a character that must deal with this corruption of innocence, McConaughey demonstrates that he can act with more than just his dimples and down-home Southern charm. Lang is a machine. He knows the teams, the leagues, the players, the game. All he does is work out and pick winners, two facts made abundantly clear by McConaughey's propensity to walk around shirtless just as often as he makes football picks. I may have rolled my eyes once or twice, but I heard nary a complaint from the ladies in the audience. Except for that one that looked a little like my Uncle Larry.Lang's corruption rests solely on the fragile shoulders of Walter Abrams, a sleazy character played so effortlessly by Al Pacino that you can't help but feel slightly disturbed by the ease with which he seems capable of tainting ambitious young men. Screaming less than usual, Pacino's portrayal is nothing short of an indictment of those sports advisors who feed on the weak. Sports gambling may be illegal in 46 states, but Abrams is well aware that 'sports advising' (the politically correct preference, no doubt) is not. Despite the false promise of certainty, sports advising is presented as more used car salesmanship than mathematical study. Figure out your client's needs, and get his money. That's the name of the game. As for actually picking a winner? It's 50-50. A flip of the coin.Sure, Lang is able to compile a pretty impressive hot streak, but what happens when it comes to a crashing halt? The peaks are indeed very high when the fun and money are flowing, but is it worth the lesson learned when your family is threatened and you're hit with the realization of what losing $380,000 can do to a family? Ultimately, the movie would have proved more effective if there had been a greater emphasis on the devastation of the lows of losing. Consequences are touched but never fully realized. I would have also liked less predictability in a movie about a very unpredictable lifestyle, but Two for the Money still succeeds in giving the audience a glimpse of what gets in the minds of those willing to gamble. Is it about the game? Is it about the money? Or, as Abrams believes, is it about the risk some people are willing to take to feel what they perceive as being alive?The dialogue and character interaction happen at a quick enough pace to grab and seal your attention, and while the last act is somewhat weighed down by the two-hour runtime and the semi-sappy melodrama of plans gone awry, Money still manages to convince the audience to care about whether or not Brandon can get back to where he began - the purity of the game.You want certainty in an uncertain world? Then put your money on obligatory shirtless Matthew McConaughey scenes and Pacino's incisors getting a nice scene-chewing workout. It's a safer bet than trusting your money with the decision-making of those who care more about the profit than they do about you.THE GIST Two for the Money will prove to be most enjoyable to those with some familiarity or interest with sports and the gambling side of the business. But McConaughey and Pacino deliver enough laughs and energy to make this more accessible to those with little knowledge of the subject matter. If you have your doubts about this one then don't worry about spending the big bucks to see it on the big screen - it'll make for a good rental.",7,30,50,6 October 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Overrated. Over-hyped. Underwhelming.
","I haven't seen a movie fail to live up to the hype this much since The Blair Witch Project. Remember how it was supposed to be the scariest movie of all time? Then do you remember sitting in the theater cheering for the witch to kill off the three crybabies who kept fussing over a stupid map?Well, if you go into Shaun of the Dead expecting one of the funniest movies of the year and a masterpiece in the spoof genre, then you're going to be very disappointed as you stare at the screen and wonder when the humor will start. Please don't believe any of the reviewers claiming it's 'a laugh-a-minute.' The only way that would be possible is if you're referring to the trailer. It took almost 30 minutes before the FIRST laugh ever came.That's not an exaggeration. About the first 30 minutes of the story are spent showing us how much of a slacker Shaun is and how irresponsible he is in his relationship with Liz. I guess this is all supposed to make us like him more when he decides to save Liz and everybody around him from the zombies. Doesn't work. I was just sitting there bored out of my mind waiting for something, anything to happen.The best I can possibly say about this movie is it's merely OK. I think a viewer's enjoyment will be largely based on his perception going into the movie. After watching the trailer, I was expecting an all-out comedy/parody. And there are a few funny moments (for example, Shaun and his friend act somewhat nonchalantly towards the zombies at first as they use cricket bats and old LPs to do battle), but most of the humor can be found in the trailer.The main problem with Shaun of the Dead is it has major identity conflict. It doesn't know what it wants to be. It spoofs the zombie genre for a bit, but then we have to sit through emotional moments that put a damper on everything. I thought this was supposed to be a comedy, so why do I have to sit through a scene with Shaun crying while trying to make decisions about what to do to certain people who have turned into zombies?And then you have some pretty graphic moments that make it seem like the movie wants to have a legitimate horror movie feel. This doesn't work because the movie isn't the least bit scary. The result is the movie doesn't know exactly what it wants to be. For that reason, I think the mainstream American audience won't connect with it.The people this will connect with the most are the coffeehouse artsy types who'll love discussing the social commentary. But for me, the social commentary is about as effective as shaving with a rubber band. Exactly. Way too much time is dedicated to trying to show us that we all live zombie-like lives. We sit glaze-eyed in front of the TV playing video games, we all follow our own little cliques, we head to work in the same routine every day. Yeah, that's great. You could've expressed that point in a single sentence.There are a handful of funny and clever moments (particularly the end), but I would've liked to have seen more 'shock value' moments played for laughs. Unfortunately, Shaun of the Dead looks to be throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks. Plus, the film makers are apparently in love with repetition. I hear the wedding is in April. For example, the camera pans up from someone's feet as he stumbles about. We see the figure yawning and making a weird sound. Oh, it's Shaun. Look, he's acting like a zombie! How cute. Apparently a critic somewhere must've laughed insanely during a press screening, so they decided it'd be great to repeat this gag. ONCE WAS ENOUGH!And please don't tell me I just don't understand British humor. Folks, I get the joke, it just ain't that funny. If this is the best the British have to offer these days in regard to comedy, then I've never been prouder to be an American. THE GISTI have no desire to see this again, and I certainly won't recommend it. If you're looking for some good British comedy then I highly recommend checking out John Cleese's Fawlty Towers. But if you're in the mood to chuckle once or twice during a movie and then fight the temptation to fall asleep, then Shaun of the Dead will fill that bill. Let me put it as bluntly as I possibly can: Don't believe the hype.",Null,2,6,24 September 2004
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," I easily recommend it to all ages
","As quoted in the press notes...'And then she saw that there was a light ahead of her; not a few inches away from where the back of the wardrobe ought to have been, but a long way off...she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling through the air...' With that, C.S. Lewis sends young Lucy Pevensie into the magical world of Narnia. Likewise, once the big screen version of the wardrobe materializes, moviegoers follow Lucy into this alternate universe.That's the true beauty of Narnia - it isn't portrayed as just a figment of the children's imagination; it's a completely believable, imaginary world. C.S. Lewis never told the reader how he was supposed to perceive it; Lewis was content to leave a lot to the imagination. Even the final battle for Narnia is described in fewer than two pages.And that's the true beauty of the film - it takes the source material and fills in the blanks that had previously been left to the reader's mind. Visualizing in your head the fight between Aslan's army and the witch's minions is a joy for the creative, but watching a massive battle involving centaurs, minotaurs, dwarfs, giants, and a wide variety of other mythical creatures is truly a sight to behold.C.S. Lewis theorized that if a book is worth reading when you're five, then it needs to be equally worth reading when you're 50. The same holds for the movie - I gladly recommend this regardless of whether you're five or 50 or anywhere over, under, and in between.What makes The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe so accessible is its focus on topics that we can all relate to in some form - betrayal, forgiveness, selfless sacrifice, family, and loyalty. For Christians, the allegory behind the story certainly gives the film more meaning as Aslan, the Christ figure, battles the Devil's representative - the witch. But those who aren't as spiritually inclined will find this to be a great epic story of a battle between good and evil. The spiritual parallels are easy to recognize, but they're never heavy-handed.Fans of the book will notice that the movie has implemented some minor changes, and you may be puzzled by some curious exclusions (why was there no Giant Rumblebuffin?), but overall this is a faithful adaptation that should live up to and probably exceed your expectations. What is there not to like? The actors are great (particularly Tilda Swinton as the witch and the adorable Georgie Henley as Lucy), the CGI is remarkably impressive (Aslan looks very real!), the battle is genuinely exciting, the world of Narnia feels real, the creatures are given life without ever becoming cartoonish, and the moviegoer is treated to a two-hour vacation from whatever stress or hardships he or she may be enduring.There aren't a whole lot of movies these days that completely suck me into their world and force me to concentrate on the characters and the story rather than on the actors that I'm watching. Tom Cruise will always be Tom Cruise, and Angelina Jolie will always be Angelina Jolie. But for two hours Tilda Swinton is the evil witch, Georgie Henley is a little girl whose reactions feel real and sincere, and Aslan feels like more than just an impressive piece of CGI.This is exactly the kind of movie I want to see more of. Go see it. If you think you're too grown up to enjoy this and can't let your imagination get the best of you then perhaps it's time for you to, in the words of Todd Snider, grow back down.",10,6,13,9 December 2005
The Notebook," Love, romance, tears, and a movie based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks ensue.
","Great. Juuuuuuust great. All the years of strutting around and acting macho in front of my friends is about to come crashing down thanks to a 2-hour movie. Mr. Shade, Baker's Dozen, Walker, Carlson ... I ... I'm sorry. I'm sorry guys, but I liked this movie.I know many guys will never admit to enjoying a movie like this. I'm pretty sure Johnny Betts circa 1993 would've denied it. Admittedly, there are elements of sappiness that would send the cockiest of the peacocks running for the hills. There's soft piano. There are sunsets. There are birds flying in slow motion. There's dancing in the street with no music. And yes, the leads act a little silly at times.But come on, what guy hasn't acted silly before when he's in love? I'm man enough to admit that Stephanie and I have done some fairly silly stuff in the name of love. No, you don't need to hear any examples. I especially will NOT talk about any dance routines to Kid Rock's 'Cowboy.' *ahem*As much as guys may try to deny it, love will change you. I think the moment I knew my life had changed forever was when I let Stephanie talk me into seeing 'A Walk in the Clouds.' I kept thinking to myself, 'I can't believe I'm watching a love story starring KEANU REEVES! This is it. There's no going back. How do I hide this from my friends?' It took my system a while to recover from the shock of seeing a movie that didn't contain Bruce Willis or Sylvester Stallone spitting out one-liners, but I've since been conditioned to handle a straightforward romantic movie every now and then.And you better believe I have friends who still give me a hard time. 'Sheesh, you saw another Matthew McConaughey/Josh Lucas movie? When did you have the operation?' I always try to excuse myself by saying the movie was free or I did it all for Stephanie, but it all falls on deaf ears. Ah well, back to the movie...This is pretty standard stuff as far as love stories go. Two kids on the opposite sides of the tracks fall desperately in love. Life's obstacles split them apart. The wealthy, refined gal meets and gets engaged to an equally wealthy, refined, dashing young man, while the not-so-wealthy, gotta-work-for-everything-he's-got guy sets out to prove to the girl that he can make something of himself. The two cross paths again one day, and the girl must decide who to choose. Sounds a LOT like 'Sweet Home Alabama,' except this is a Romantic Drama whereas the former is a Romantic Comedy. There was even a wainchy mother thrown into the proceedings.So no, this isn't the most original and unpredictable movie to ever grace the screen. Before the movie started, I wrote down exactly what I thought was going to happen. You know what? I nailed it. But here's the important part - that didn't ruin the experience at all. Even though I had a preconceived idea of how everything would turn out, the story is told in such a way that I was more interested in *how* we'd get to the conclusion than in whether or not the conclusion would be as expected. However, there were a couple of times when I had doubts about my theory, and the very end is a little unexpected.The real selling point of 'The Notebook' is the cast. Everybody does a great job. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are really, really good as the leads, and the two of them kept me fully interested in what I was watching. In a movie world full of pretty boys (you can keep Leonardo DiCaprio), Gosling's a breath of fresh air as just a regular guy who you can't help but root for. And McAdam's is very charming as the Southern belle. Easy on the eyes, that gal is. I really bought into their relationship. I'll even go so far as to say they displayed the most chemistry in a couple that I've seen in a long time. Yep, even moreso than Hellboy and Selma Blair. I know, it sure blew me away as well.I also liked James Marsden's (aka Cyclops) character. I was hoping he'd be a big jerk thus making it a no-brainer who McAdams should be with, but he's actually a pretty good guy, and he doesn't really give you a reason to hate him. And Sam Shepard is very funny as Gosling's father. I just wish he'd had a little more screen time.I need to point out that James Garner and Gena Rowlands play big secondary roles. You see, the story is being told by Garner as he reads it to Rowlands. So the main story is actually a collection of flashbacks. What is the relationship between Garner and Rowlands? Well, I'm not gonna spoil anything for you.Garner and Rowlands do good jobs (although I pray I never have to see Garner in a wife-beater shirt again), but I was more interested in the relationship between Gosling and McAdams. In fact, I probably would've given this movie 4 marks, but I was a little disappointed in the last 10 or 15 minutes. The story completely shifts focus to the older folks, and we never see the youngsters again. I really would've loved one more flashback, but oh well. Warning: The very end will probably have a LOT of you reaching for the Kleenex. Pretty touching stuff, but it might not send you home tapping your toes.Now if you'll excuse me, I've got something I've gotta go sew back on. After all, I've got a reputation to protect.Rating: 3.5 (out of 5)",Null,0,0,12 July 2004
The Girl Next Door," You might just choose to take a shower afterwards.
","*Throws my arms up* I don't really know what to say. I know that will shock a lot of people, especially anyone that knows me, but it's true. Well, I do know a few things to say, so I'll give it a shot. This had the potential to be a good movie, but the subject matter is just too uncomfortable for me. The movie has its funny moments, and the actors mostly do a credible job, but I can't throw my support behind a movie that chooses to turn the porn industry into a great, big, huggable teddy bear.Emile Hirsch ('The Emperor's Club') does a good job, but man, he's totally channeling Kevin Arnold! WHERE'S PAUL PFEIFFER WHEN YOU NEED HIM???? And Elisha Cuthbert looks mighty fine, but I don't know if I completely bought into their relationship. I was surprised when I found out they were supposed to be the same age in the movie. In real life she's three years older than he is, and she looks even older than that in the movie. But the scene-stealer in this movie is Timothy Olyphant. At times he seems like a good guy with a good heart, and then he turns around and makes you think, 'Whoa, what a psycho.' Granted, I'm sure many people have felt the same way about their relatives, but this guy is an extreme case.My main problem is 'The Girl Next Door' is clearly marketing itself as a teen movie (just watch any of the recent commercials), yet it seems to send a message that hey, a little pornography might just be a worthy after-high-school business plan! 'You're a straight-A student, but you don't have the money to go to Georgetown? Noooooo problem, hook up with a porn star, film a porn flick in your school library, and make tons of money!' Am I the only one who finds that to be an inappropriate message? I hope not. I sure know Jack Arnold wouldn't have stood for this! THE GIST  Why use your intelligence or hard work to solve a problem when you can fall back on the old 'sex sells' adage, 'The Girl Next Door' asks. Well, why spend your hard-earned money on this movie and prove them right, is what I ask. And don't call me a prude. We're talking about a movie that wants its intended teen audience to think that the porn industry offers some viable after-school career options. It doesn't take a preacher or an episode of '7th Heaven' to realize that message is a bit problematic.",Null,0,0,16 June 2004
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Sure, it looks pretty, but where's the 'wow' factor?
","Ice Age: The Meltdown is a perfect example of the kind of movie I hate to review. No matter what I say, it's going to make approximately $1 billion on opening weekend, so what's the point? Plus, a lot of my readers are guys who are only interested in movies where at least 42 people get shot or Adam Sandler talks in a funny voice and makes sounds that have no grammatical basis. The day they go to see Ice Age: The Meltdown is the day Rob Schneider gets nominated for an Oscar, which would most likely also be the day I vow to stop watching movies completely.So writing this review is nothing more than an exercise in futility. If you enjoyed the original then you'll go see this follow-up no matter how harsh I am. If you hated the original then even my softest, most poetic words would be hard-pressed to convince you this was worth your time or money. So you know what? Go with your gut on this one; I really don't care either way.I never saw Ice Age so I can't compare the two. All I know is that this installment, while cute and pleasant enough, has no real 'wow' factor. Sure, it looks nice and is fairly harmless, but it tries just a little too hard to cater to the smallest of children while leaving most adults a little alienated. The problem is that the writers at Pixar have mastered the fine art of being clever enough to appeal equally to both children and adults (think Toy Story and The Incredibles). Everybody else (yes, this means you, Ice Age) is just a distant contender with a flair for pretty graphics rather than sharp storytelling.I heard somebody on the radio refer to Ice Age 2 as 'better than Toy Story.' As Teaspoon Hunter might say, 'Cow pies.' Not even close. You can sell that some place else, Sam Cain, because Emma ain't buyin' it (sorry, a little Young Riders (buy the DVD!) reference for you).Now if I had been hired to work on the movie then I would've titled it Ice Age: The Final Countdown. At the end of the movie CGI versions of the members of Europe would have shown up and all the prehistoric animals would have jammed to their undeserved hit The Final Countdown. That would've been some sweet action, and you know it. Just picture CGI versions of the bandmates' bad 80s hairdos. Talk about a missed opportunity.",5,3,6,7 April 2006
Balls of Fury," The jokes suffer from the 'Kate Moss, Heather Mills McCartney, and post-2000 Muhammad Ali Syndrome.'
","Taxi. The Pacifier. Herbie Fully Loaded. Let's Go to Prison. Night at the Museum. If this list of movies is an accurate representation of your DVD collection, then my friends, you either have a young child in the house or a strange fetish for average-to-below average comedies. Or 'absolutely dreadful' in the case of Jimmy Fallon's Taxi. *shudders* I'm still trying to erase memories of that steamer from my mind.Other than being part of the aforementioned pathetically sad DVD collection, do you know what else each of these movies has in common? They're all written by Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon, the duo who wrote, produced, and directed Balls of Fury. Are you trying to decide whether or not this is a film worthy of your time and money? Please let my above revelation stand as 'enough said.' In all honesty, what can you expect when you take a poor man's Jack Black and give him the starring role in a poor man's Dodgeball? A little thing I like to refer to as 'not much.' Dan Fogler gives it the ol' college try, but perhaps the material is to blame for his mostly forgettable performance. He delivers a couple of laugh-out-loud moments, but by the time he's lip-synching to Def Leppard you'll be asking yourself, 'So who's this guy, and why is he doing a bad karaoke impersonation of 'Jack Black Meets Sam Kinison'?' I will give Balls of Fury three credits - 1) Maggie Q is adorable, 2) The film rightfully never takes itself too seriously, and 3) It's nowhere near as filthy as I expected. At the top of my notebook I wrote, 'Balls/Genitalia References' and I was set to keep track. I just knew they were going to fly off the screen fast and furious, especially judging by the 'a huge comedy with tiny balls' tagline. So I was quite shocked when the grand total was only one, and that one was merely Maggie Q's character disgustedly relaying an example of the comments she was forced to deal with from male players.What more can I say about a film whose crowning achievement is, 'Well, I didn't expect much, and it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, so whatever'? That certainly doesn't send you rushing to purchase a ticket, now does it? It'll be on TNT or TBS soon enough so just have patience and watch a few legitimately good comedies in the interim. There'll come a time when you're flipping channels, nothing else is on, and you'll cruise across this. You can decide then whether you want to sit through all of it. The end result will likely be a long email thanking me for saving you $8.Before I commence, let me once again bring attention to my above 'poor man's Dodgeball' quote. I overheard several disappointed people say, 'I thought it'd be like Dodgeball.' What's that? Yeah, they said it in unison, Wisenheimer. Now shut up. The consensus? It's not even close. So if that was the opinion you formed after watching the trailer then dismiss that notion immediately. It's an interesting concept that probably contains about ten minutes of solid comedic material.What ultimately happens when you stretch that over an hour and a half? Unfortunately, the jokes suffer from what I like to call the 'Kate Moss, Heather Mills McCartney, and post-2000 Muhammad Ali Syndrome.' In other words, they're flat, lame, and they pack no punch. Let's see them put THAT on the DVD cover.",5,104,201,30 August 2007
Spider-Man 2," A great sequel that stands on its own
","'Spider-Man 2' is a great, fun movie. The special effects are some of the best I've seen. I was especially glad to see that the effects of Spider-Man webbing his way around the city looked a lot less CGI-ish than in the first. When the action is going, then this movie is hard to beat in terms of pure fun. I also liked the bits of comic relief. The elevator scene with Spider-Man is great, but J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson steals the show. I laughed at just about every one of his lines. He is perfectly cast. But I have a few complaints that keep me from giving 'Spider-Man 2' a perfect score:*Kirsten Dunst can't act. Well, if she can, then she sure didn't show it in this movie. She showed NO EMOTION whatsoever, and she and Tobey Maguire demonstrated NO CHEMISTRY at all. Whenever she'd spew out a 'Go get 'em, Tiger' line, my eyes started rolling like a slot machine. I honestly couldn't have cared less if they got together.*There are too many close-ups of Maguire and Dunst. Personally, I don't think Dunst (Skeletor, as I like to call her) is attractive. You may call this shallow, but if they insist on showing extreme close-ups of actors, then I'd like to not be repulsed.*I thought Molina's PORTRAYAL of Dr. Octopus was very good, and I really like the character. Unfortunately, every time I saw Molina with his shirt off I burst out laughing. Couldn't he have gotten in at least a little shape? Seeing Dr. Octopus' man boobs flapping around isn't very intimidating. I laughed especially hard when he was walking around in his wife beater and white pants. What was THAT?? Doc Ock was cooler than the Green Goblin, but Willem Dafoe had a better look than Molina.*James Franco (as Harry Osborne) was underused. He's the best actor in this movie, and you know what, he actually SHOWED SOME EMOTION! Personally, I would've preferred Franco as Spider-Man (I know Stephanie agrees, believe me), but I guess Peter Parker is supposed to be a bit of a dweeb, and well, Maguire definitely fits that part. But Franco should've been given more to do. Hopefully he'll have a bigger role in the next one, and I'll pray that Dunst gets lost in the shuffle. Don't get me wrong; 'Spider-Man 2' is a fast-paced, entertaining movie that I'd recommend to everybody. Not only will I add it to my DVD collection one day, but I also wouldn't mind seeing it at the theater again. But let's lighten up on the Maquire/Dunst close-ups, give Franco more to do, and please, somebody find Alfred Molina a stinkin' shirt! Rating: 4 (out of 5)",Null,0,0,6 July 2004
Alexander," Somehow, 'tedious' isn't quite harsh enough
","'In you lives the light of this world. Your companions will long be shadows in the underworld, when you will be the one, forever young, forever inspiring - never will there be an Alexander like you - Alexander the Great.' Well, those are the words of Olympias, Alexander's mother (Jolie), but if this movie is any judge, then he should've been called Alexander the Boring. Or Alexander the Tedious. Perhaps Alexander the Way Too Talkative? You get the idea.Folks, this movie is 3 hours long, and it makes sure you know it. It's been a while since I've wanted a movie to end so badly. I lost interest at the hour and a half mark and was near tears when I thought about how it was only halfway over. Still, I trudged forward, thinking the action would pick up a bit. 'There are bound to be a few more fight scenes coming up,' I figured. Should've used the calculator on this one because I figured wrong.Alexander conquered 90% of the known world, right? Well, I guess I just assumed that meant the movie would explore why he was such a great leader and warrior. Silly me. I wish I'd been warned that instead, this movie is about all the boring conversations he apparently had between battles.There are only two battle scenes (the Battle of Gaugamela and the Battle of India). TWO! Many historians feel Alexander possessed the greatest military mind of all time, so two small battle scenes is unforgivable. The Battle of India was pretty cool with the armored elephants, but other than that things were really too fast and chaotic to get a grasp of what was going on. The bird's eye view was pretty cool though, and that's about the best I can say regarding the movie. Pretty sad, really.What makes the movie so bad? Let's examine just a few details.* The dialogue is embarrassingly bad at times. Anthony Hopkins actually has to use a line in which he states that Alexander never lost a battle except to Hephaistion's thighs. Or something like that. It's a reference to them wrestling as teenagers, but it's horribly awkward dialogue. Absolutely laughable.* I don't care how realistic it is, but teenage boys wrestling in big diapers look ridiculous. The fact that we can see Alexander's big diaper under his army skirt is even worse.* What is up with Alexander's hair? He has bad hair in every stage of life. It looks extremely fake, especially the bad dye job. The worst was the mullet. For a minute there I thought I was watching David Spade as Joe Dirt.* A lot of controversy has surrounded the relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion (Leto). I don't know if Alexander was actually bisexual, so I'm not really gonna speculate. I simply haven't researched the subject enough to know. But everybody involved with the movie claims that the relationship isn't really meant to be looked at in a sexual manner. Could've fooled me. The sappy dialogue between the two is painfully embarrassing, as evidenced by the theater audience's laughter. They hug, pledge their devotion to each other, use mock poetic language, etc. When Hephaistion told Alexander that he was the sun to him and that he was jealous of losing him to the world, all while undressing him with his eyes, I started to wonder what gay soap opera I had accidentally stumbled upon. Sorry, but that's not exactly what I want to see in what is supposed to be an epic war movie.* Oliver Stone somehow failed at character development, despite the fact that he had three hours to work with. It would've been nice to know what exactly drove and inspired the characters. For example, Alexander sees Roxane (Rosario Dawson) dance and then the next thing you know they're getting married. Why did he choose her of all the women dancing? I don't know, nor will you after watching the movie.* The love scene between Colin Farrell and Rosario Dawson is very strange. I kept expecting some wonka wonka porn music to start playing. When Farrell let out a little cat-like growl I shook my head and started to look around the theater for the exits.* File 'Transvestite-Looking Men Belly Dancing For an Extended Period of Time' under 'Scenes I Hope to Never See Again in Life.' Then to make it worse, Farrell kissed the guy afterwards. Sigh. Three hours, folks. Three hours I'll *never* get back. I'm WARNING you.I could on, talking about the over-the-top acting, the messy editing, the lack of story cohesion, etc., but I've wasted enough of my time on this movie.The biggest failure of Alexander is that after the credits rolled, I was left with the question, 'What exactly was the point of the movie?' What exactly was Stone trying to accomplish? The subject is Alexander the Great, so why, after three hours, does Stone not give us any real insight into his military mind?Why was Alexander so great? Stone just doesn't tell us. The movie gave me no reason to root for the guy. Anthony Hopkins' narration tells us his accomplishments, but the movie itself doesn't really show us what made him such a great conqueror.Stone claims to have a great awe and respect for Alexander. If this is true, then why does he leave us with the impression that Alexander was a boring whiner? Why are we left scratching our heads in amazement that Alexander conquered the world?I would say 'nice try,' but I can't even give Mr. Stone that much credit. I doubt even Alexander himself could sit through this.Rating: 2 (out of 5)",Null,6,10,24 November 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," I'm gonna head to the bathroom and take a Day After Tomorrow
","Do you like a good old-fashioned action-packed Summer movie with a good story and scientific accuracy? Welp, you best keep on looking because you won't find those ingredients in 'The Day After Tomorrow.'
This is one of those movies where the entertainment value is in how much you can make fun of it. And believe me, Stephanie, Mr. Shade, and I poked fun at the movie for the entire two hours. What else can you do with a movie this ridiculous? I'll admit the special effects are really good. The problem is that they're used up in the first half of the movie. I was expecting a full 2 hours of action and chaos, but they got all that out of the way and the rest of the movie focuses on the characters and their attempts to survive.How cheesy is this movie? Let me count the ways...1) Gyllenhaal supposedly fails his math class because on his final exam he only wrote the answers. He did all the work in his head, you see. That's just how much of a genius he is. So he and Quaid determine the teacher just failed him because he's jealous. Um, when I was in school I had to show my work. Sorry to be the bad guy here, but it's easy to see why the teacher might be suspicious. But this is a final exam, so wouldn't this issue have been addressed earlier? Sigh. I thought for sure later in the movie Gyllenhaal was gonna save the world but he was gonna figure it out in his head so the movie wouldn't have to explain to us how he did it. Thankfully, the movie didn't get quite that extreme.2) This movie leads us to believe that a tornado warning cannot be issued until turning on the news and checking the weather report.3) You gotta love the overdramatic delivery of dialogue: 'Looks like a hurricane.' *dramatic pause* 'Only hurricanes DON'T FORM OVER LAND!'4) The temperature supposedly starts to drop 10 degrees per minute. Riiiiiiiight. So within an hour the temperature would be 600 degrees below zero? And as the temperature starts dropping, we see everything freezing. Particularly ridiculous is when Gyllenhaal and his buddies are in a library and we see the floor freezing and chasing after them. They manage to jump in a room and close the door JUST IN TIME! For some reason the door magically shields them from the cold. Whatever.5) Quaid and his friends are able to survive walking in sub-zero temperatures with little more than parkas and gloves. And they have these tents that apparently have magical warming powers because once in the tents they're able to take off their gloves and hats and not be cold at all!I could go on, but I think you get it. Ohhh, and what was the point of Quaid walking all the way from D.C. to New York just to find his son? He knew his son was holed up in the library, and he didn't show up with a rescue squad or anything to take him home. Oh yeah, he made a promise. Mr. Shade leaned over to me and said, 'If I ever promise you that I'll meet you at the movie theater and the whole world freezes over, then don't expect me to be there.' Fair enough. It was obviously supposed to add an emotional element to the story, but it did nothing for me. Quaid should've just waited and taken a helicopter to New York after the storm died down. It would've been better than risking his and his partners' lives.I could write a thesis on the absurdity of the science used in the movie, but I won't bore you. There are plenty of articles by climatologists you can read that state how the events in the movie are impossible, especially a glaciation of this magnitude occurring in three days and catching the ENTIRE WORLD by surprise. Folks, Memphis weathermen interrupt my regularly scheduled programming whenever a drop of rain is registered, so you better believe they'd be on top of this.Let me just add that this movie is based on the book, 'The Coming Global Superstorm' by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber. Strieber wrote another book called 'Communion,' in which he claims he was told of the Earth's upcoming apocalypse by aliens. If that's who you wanna get your science from then go ahead. I hope you'll excuse me while I point and laugh at you.I feel sorry for fringe groups who are actually using this movie to tout their political agenda. Saying this is a movie people should watch to prepare for a possible global warming catastrophe is about as legitimate as saying people should watch 'Dawn of the Dead' to prepare for what would happen if zombies attacked. I'd say they're on equal ground in regard to scientific accuracy. But I doubt too many moviegoers are gonna take this seriously.There's so much more to make fun of, but I'm gonna stop myself. I was extremely disappointed in the movie, so there's a good chance you will be also. This is the type of movie that shows a weatherman get hit by a huge billboard during the middle of the storm, and the only emotion it prompts is laughter. You've been warned.'The Day After Tomorrow' is the kind of movie that might have scared me when I was 6 years old and uneducated. Now I can't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. But hey, if you like movies with overwrought dialogue, a lame attempt at a love story, a severe lack of tension, no emotional pull (other than laughter), less believability than 'Independence Day,' and one of the most anticlimactic endings I've ever seen in a Summer blockbuster, then this is the movie for you.Now if y'all will excuse me, I'm gonna head to the bathroom and take a Day After Tomorrow.",Null,43,82,28 May 2004
Zodiac," The fear of the real and the unknown...
","Dark. Moody. Atmospheric. All words to describe a candlelight dinner with Johnny Betts. But these words can also be used to accurately describe David Fincher's latest foray into the serial killer genre.Zodiac has been on my 'most anticipated' list for quite some time, but having watched many documentaries and read several articles on the subject, I couldn't help but wonder how the film could completely keep my interest when I already knew so much about the material. Plus, we're all aware that the case officially remains unresolved, so are we to resign ourselves to accept an unsatisfactory conclusion? It took no more than the film's chilling opening scene to cast my fears aside and glue me to the seat for 158 minutes. My familiarity with the source material actually heightened my enjoyment because I was surprised at how accurately the film depicted the events. I recognized names and details that I wouldn't have otherwise.I also feel that not definitively knowing the Zodiac's identity adds more suspense to the story. We're introduced to a number of suspects, and since this is, in part, one man's interpretation of circumstantial evidence, we're allowed to assume that any of the suspects could be the mysterious killer. It's a plot device that effectively keeps the viewer in a constant state of unease.I know there are multiple theories on the Zodiac's identity, so you can argue that the film ends on an anticlimactic note. But the movie does have focus, and it presents a compelling case against one of the suspects in such a way that it delivers as much closure as you can expect.The actors are great (especially Downey and his welcome comic relief), the atmosphere is foreboding, and the investigative process is engaging. It may run a little long for some, but I didn't mind the runtime at all. It's a fascinating case, and I wanted all the information the movie was willing to give me.Zodiac is the kind of film that sticks with you. I was at a friend's house late after the screening, and when I arrived home I saw a lone car's headlights appear from up the street. My heart began to race a little as I hastened to my door. I knew then and there that a new Zodiac killer was in the vicinity, and I had no time to tarry.It's been a while since a movie instilled that sort of realistic dread, and I don't know if that's a good thing, but it's certainly a sign (no pun intended) of the film's success in heightening our awareness of what kind of real-life monsters might be lurking in the shadows.THE GIST Zodiac gives viewers an excellent combination of nerve-racking suspense and desperately obsessed police procedural work. The majority of viewers with even the slightest interest in the case should be riveted. Those of you with a severely small attention span should probably stick to Norbit instead.",9,236,320,2 March 2007
Ocean's Twelve," I may be in the minority, but I thought it was slightly better than Ocean's 11...
","Stylish. Original. Full of personality. All words used to describe Johnny Betts' hair. But, interestingly enough, they also form an accurate description of Ocean's 12.This sequel has much of the same feel as Ocean's 11, but it takes a slightly different approach. Rather than focus on the heist, it gives more attention to the characters and their attempts at getting out of the trouble they're facing. In the first one, the movie starts off by introducing us to each of the main characters. Here, we watch as Andy Garcia tracks each one down and issues his threat - pay him his money within two weeks or suffer the consequences.Also, in Ocean's 11, everything seemed to fall into place for our beloved thieves. Not anymore. Now everything seems to go wrong, and the crew finds itself face-to-face with one obstacle after another. I'm just curious, is it bad to cheer for thieves and wish them the best? It's OK if it's just a movie, right? I sure hope so.You're dying to know which movie I preferred, right? No? Well I'll tell you anyway. I know I'll probably be in the minority here, but I enjoyed Ocean's 12 a little more than Ocean's 11. Why? Well, since you asked:* Catherine Zeta-Jones! Finally, some eye candy for the guys! And no, Julia Roberts is NOT eye candy, except for people with a skeleton fetish. Plus, CZJ (as I like to call her) does a good job in her role as a detective with a father who was a thief. Her character adds another element of mystery.* It's funnier than the first. Two great sources of comedy are the cameos of Bruce Willis and Topher Grace as themselves. Topher whines about how his Kabbalah bracelet isn't working, and when talking about the efforts he took to try to win the love of a girl he claims, 'I totally phoned in that Dennis Quaid movie.' I won't say anything about Bruce's cameo, but it's great. The humor is mainly a reflection of how much everybody obviously enjoyed making this movie.* I do not like Julia Roberts. I have NEVER understood her appeal. And not to be shallow, but I don't find her the least bit attractive. So how is that relevant to why I prefer Ocean's 12? Well, Julia was a distraction in Ocean's 11, but here she has one enjoyable scene that made me not think about how much I can't stand her! When a movie can do that, then it has really accomplished something.* The story is a little smarter, a little more clever than the first one. Some people might not like the fact that everything isn't spelled out along the way, but I enjoyed being kept in the dark a bit. The important thing is that all is revealed at the end. I know a couple of people complained that they didn't understand everything because the story wasn't told in a linear fashion. One complaint was that the big revelation was 'unfair' because it prevented the viewer from being able to figure everything out on his own. Fine with me. What's wrong with surprises?One guy even complained that the ending was the movie's attempt to make you pay to go see the movie again just to understand it. I would have to disagree. I had no problem following the story, and you don't really have to watch it again to figure it all out, but it's one I *do* want to watch again so I can approach it with a different perspective.I recommend watching Ocean's 11 first. If you've already seen it, then it wouldn't hurt to watch it again just as a refresher. Once you've done that you'll be ready to enjoy Ocean's 12. Just don't yell and scream at me if *you* end up not liking it as much Ocean's 11. After all, it's just a movie, and the fact that we have a different preference won't prevent a cure for cancer. If it does, then that'll sure be weird and I pledge to never see another movie again because man, it's just not worth stopping a cure for cancer.THE GISTA little more clever, and a little funnier than its predecessor, Ocean's 12 presents itself as yet another slick and stylish movie in the heist genre. If you can handle a little style over substance, then you should be entertained. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you. Rating: 4 (out of 5)",8,1,3,16 December 2004
Crash," An examination of fear and bigotry from multiple perspectives ensues.
","An angry housewife and her successful District Attorney husband. A Persian store owner. Two police detectives (a black male and a Puerto Rican female) with a complex relationship. A black television director and his wife. A Mexican locksmith with a young daughter. Two car-jackers. A rookie cop. A jaded cop who's seen so much on the force that he's lost his way. A middle-aged Korean couple...They're all part of the racial diversity that colors Los Angeles. They're all searching for answers, they're all moving forward, they're all coming together, they're all falling apart, and in the next 36 hours they will all collide. JOHNNY'S TAKE 'You think you know who you are? You have no idea.'Those words, spoken by Matt Dillon to Ryan Phillippe, are probably the most poignant of the movie. Not only do some of the characters not know who they are, but the audience doesn't even know. Crash does an ingenious job of forcing the viewer to confront his own prejudices by presenting us with characters and causing us to develop our perception of them, but then as the layers are stripped away, we start to realize that perspective can change. We all have our prejudices whether we want to admit it or not, and one or two actions will immediately shape our opinion of these characters. But do those actions completely define the character?Suspected reprehensible characters are slowly revealed to have a little more depth to them than we initially expect. Matt Dillon is painted as a bigoted, sexist cop. His early actions are indeed reprehensible, but we soon realize there's more to him than our first impression. The years have torn away at him as he's had to take care of his ailing father without being able to get adequate medical care. There's a reason he's turned so bitter, and when his humanity is put to the test, in one of the most powerful scenes in the movie, will he realize the hope that is within him? Nobody is beyond redemption.Then there's Ludakris (who does a surprisingly good job) who wants to blame everything on racism. He's so blinded by hate that he blames poor service at a restaurant on racism despite the fact that his waitress was black. When his friend (Tate) points this out, Ludakris argues that she has been manufactured by white people to believe in the stereotype that black people don't tip. He's a street thug whose idea of nobility is stealing only from white people. His reasoning? Stealing from other black people is just a sign of cowardice towards whites. Of course, that so-called 'nobility' is later put to the test. Is he beyond redemption? Or is there hope?You'll also learn that nobody's halo shines too brightly. Just when you're starting to feel sorry for a character that appears to be a victim, you'll soon see they're just as capable of breaking the IL' Golden Rule as those who have wronged them. If you're going to accept the idea that nobody is beyond redemption, then you have to accept that nobody is beyond reproach either.You think you know who you are? You have no idea. At least not until your character and humanity are put to the test. Holding onto a set of ideals and dreams is admirable, but actually living out those ideals and dreams is what defines you. True character is displayed through actions. And reactions. We're all searching for answers, we're all moving forward, we're all coming together, we're all falling apart, and our paths may one day collide. Whatever the circumstances may be, the way we act and react to that collison is what's important. THE GIST Crash is a strongly-written, strongly-acted, emotionally-gripping, thought-provoking movie that never gets as preachy as you may fear. I could add a few more hyphenated words, but I think you get the point. Some of the stereotypes are exaggerated for effect, but this is a movie that combines just the right amount of humor with some very tense drama to force us to take a close look at how we view others. Is it really fair to blame everything on racism? Sometimes we may unfairly assess a person's character based on his or her appearance, but is that borne of prejudice or is it just a matter of being overly cautious in a world where it's hard to trust those you don't know? Actions speak loudly, but so do our reactions.This is probably a little too heavy for younger audiences and a little too dark for anybody who just wants to escape from the world for a couple of hours, but for those of you who want a bit of dramatic storytelling then Crash serves up one of this year's best.

The Polar Express," Better than expected
","*removes sunglasses and takes cool guy tooth pick out of mouth*Have you ever wondered what a midnight trip to the North Pole would look like? No? Neither have I. But that doesn't stop The Polar Express from attempting to capture that journey through the eyes of a young boy. As cool as I try to act, I have to admit that it is a pretty impressive journey. I know I'll catch heat from my friends for praising a G-rated animated Christmas movie starring Tom Hanks, but I'm man enough to give credit where it's warranted.The Polar Express is definitely geared more towards children. After all, the entire story is told from a young boy's perspective. The viewer is witnessing a dream inside his head; a dream that explores that pivotal moment in a child's life where he must choose to either close the door on part of his childhood, or to keep pretending that he believes in Santa Claus just so he can force his parents to continue to give him gifts from 'Santa Claus.' I'll never forget the fateful day when my parents closed that door of my childhood themselves, resulting in half the number of Christmas gifts in the years to come. It was a sad time, one that certainly put a damper on my 18th birthday, which was less than two months away.So unlike Johnny Betts, the kids on the polar express still have a choice. Each is on his or her own personal journey, and each has a lesson to learn.The first hour of the movie is great and moves at a very fast pace as we witness the adventures that occur as the train makes its way to the North Pole. Everything on screen is just impressive to look at - the scenery, the animation, the action, the characters. I especially liked the first-person view of the train barreling down a roller coaster-esque track. Robert Zemeckis wanted to make the movie feel like an oil painting come alive, and he succeeded. Not that I'm an expert on oil paintings and what they would look like if they were given life, but I digress.The movie does slow down for the last 20-25 minutes. Once the train trip has ended and the destination is reached, the movie starts to *ahem* lose steam. Bwahaha! But hey, prior to that, it was chugging along *snicker* at a great pace. I'm sorry. I was just trying to think of some lame puns that I'm sure plenty of movie critics are using in their reviews. I'm pretty sure I succeeded.Anyway, I could have done without the little sentimental musical number where three of the kids join together to sing about 'when Christmas comes to town.' And macho guys might start to lose interest once the children begin to learn their individual lesson. Yeah yeah, it's all sweet and good, but it's nothing original. I won't fault the filmmakers for that. A good 'moral of the story' in a kid's movie never hurt anybody. So if you start to zone out then just pay close attention to all the fine detail, and you'll be impressed.One of the things that I found most impressive is the characterizations of the humans. The human characters benefit greatly due to a brand new system called Performance Capture. Performance Capture is a process in which the actors wear form-fitting motion capture suits, but unlike regular motion capture, Performance Capture is able to capture genuine emotions and natural expressions. Every single movement by the actor is captured, down to the flutter of an eyelid. The result is the best CG humans I've seen. The mouth movements actually look pretty good! Most CG humans look like they've got peanut butter stuck on the roof of their mouth when they talk, so this is an excellent advancement. I'm eager to watch this system develop.One of the main points in the movie, as the conductor tells the little boy, is 'it doesn't matter where the train is going. What matters is deciding to get on.' I don't know that I agree with that. What if the train is going to Detroit's inner-city? Or even worse, what if the train is actually on its way to Hell? What small child is gonna want to take that trip? If you decide to get on then you're in trouble, and you've got the conductor to thank. Quite the disturbing message, don't you think, Mr. Zemeckis? Oh well, it's all right to look past this and enjoy this visually stunning film.*puts sunglasses back on and places toothpick back in mouth*THE GISTIf you're looking for a movie you can take the entire family to, then go see The Incredibles. If you've already seen it, then The Polar Express is a very good second option. It's a little more child-oriented than The Incredibles, and the sappy moments might slightly grate the coolest of cats, but it's an entertaining movie, and at the very least you'll enjoy the visual experience.

Nacho Libre," Thank goodness for Jack Black, the saving grace
","Watching Nacho Libre is a weird experience. Just when you're convinced that you hate it and you're making plans to hunt down director Jared Hess and punch him in the face, Jack Black goes and does something totally outrageous that has you unashamedly laughing out loud. Hess should thank Black, his saving grace, because about 15 minutes into the movie (with hardly a laugh in sight) I was already forming a posse.It says a lot about Black's talent that his mere presence can keep a film afloat. His contorted facial expressions, decidedly unsexy poses, fake Spanish accent, and tendency to break out into song is enough to keep his fans, like yours truly, entertained. His narration of a letter he wrote to Sister Encarnacion is particularly hysterical. But the movie's strong point also exposes its main weakness - without Black this film is a disaster.Feel free to send your letter of thanks to the screenwriters for that. The script is surprisingly weak, the plethora of bathroom jokes giving testament to that. Who sits around and thinks, 'Hey, smearing manure on a guy's face would be HIIII-LARIOUS'? And what purpose, other than appealing to the least common denominator, is served by having Nacho occasionally accompanied by really fake-sounding farts? I question the necessity of such bathroom humor, my pupils rolling 180 degrees into the back of my head at each poop reference, yet at least 50% of the audience howls with laughter. Cheap laughs, 'purpose' be thy name.Thank goodness for Black's ad-libbing. There's no other way to explain the laugh-out-loud moments. Even when a slice of dialogue is obviously weak on paper, Black is skillful enough to make it work. It looks effortless. Unfortunately, Nacho Libre doesn't sustain a high enough laugh-to-head shaking ratio to make me a completely satisfied viewer.I can appreciate the film's desire to offer something quirky and original, but I can't appreciate its inability to be consistently funny while doing so. There are just too many stupid jokes that fall flatter than Kate Moss' ... current hairdo.Nacho Libre is one of those films that will be more enjoyable on a second viewing thanks to the wonderful mechanism that is known as the fast-forward button. I know where the good stuff is and can hopscotch my way to it. Disappointing? A little. Since I like Jack and his over-the-top stylings, this is a movie I wanted to love all the way through. Walking out of the theater, feeling slightly relieved that it wasn't 'as horrible as I feared' just isn't a benchmark of greatness.THE GIST Nacho Libre is blatantly going after the same cult following that affixed itself to Napoleon Dynamite (same director, after all), and that's fine - it'll definitely have a following. You don't need Fodor's Guide to Nacho Libre to figure out if you'll be a part of this following.If you've deemed the trailer the funniest thing since Johnny Betts' last review then go have a blast. If, like I, you're on the fence then don't risk it - save it for a rental. And if you don't like Jack Black at all then this is definitely NACHO kind of movie ... BWAHAHAHA! Sorry, but considering some of the bad jokes the Hess brothers forced on me, I figured I owed 'em one.",6,2,7,15 June 2006
The Village," A thriller that is to be seen as social commentary ensues.
","Personally, I enjoyed this film. I didn't find it all that scary, although it does have its moments, but what's most important is that it keeps a level of suspense and tension throughout. I was continually guessing and trying to fill in the blanks on my own. And hey, that's good enough to keep me entertained.As far as the ending goes, well, it's gonna make or break the movie for a lot of you. I don't think it is as effective as the endings of The Sixth Sense or Signs, but I will say that at least it did surprise me. There are a few obligatory twists along the way that aren't exactly earth shattering (yet still effective), but the revelation at the end is the big surprise. Is it completely satisfying? Not for me. I had my own idea of how I wanted things to turn out, but hey, it's M. Night's vision, so I can appreciate it on that level.The revelation does turn the movie upside down, so if you're the type who gets easily upset when a movie doesn't turn out completely how you expect, then you could be disappointed. But chances are, if you see this movie with somebody else, then you WILL be talking about it afterwards.There are some minor annoyances in the film. I don't think the story is as tight as The Sixth Sense or Signs. There just seem to be a few more plot holes, none of which I can discuss here, but all of which I can easily make fun of. If you've seen the movie then email me and we'll talk. One of the things we'll most likely talk about is William Hurt's Jeff Bridges impersonation. And the dialogue is a little laughable at times. Why did they have to use so many Yoda-esque phrases? 'The old shed that is not to be used'?? And if the creatures are 'those we don't speak of' then WHY DO THEY SPEAK OF THEM SO MUCH?!?!?!Ah well, for me it's all stuff that is easily overlooked. What M. Night has done is taken a vision and constructed it into a suspenseful little story, never giving away too much at any one time. He messes with your mind and completely manipulates you until the very end. I have no problem with that. It's a movie! Manipulate my emotions all you want! Slap me around, and I'll thank you for it later! If you're the type who likes everything completely straightforward, well, you've been warned. THE GIST:The thing I like about M. Night's movies is that going in you know there is gonna be some sort of a puzzle. You can sit back and watch the pieces fall into place, or you can try to solve everything yourself. The Village isn't the most tightly constructed puzzle that Night has assembled, but it never failed to keep me in suspense and entertained.",Null,0,0,4 August 2004
The Hills Have Eyes," If you're in the mood for one of 2006's most brutal movies...
","Shocking. Disturbing. At times hard to watch. All words to describe the horror of being forced to watch Michael Moore take his shirt off. But these terms also accurately describe this brutally vicious upgrade on Wes Craven's 1977 low-budget horror classic.What would you do if you were traveling through the desert and became stranded amongst a group of genetically-mutated freaks who were intent on killing you? You'd probably die. Granted, I would kick all sorts of genetically-mutated butt (not an easy accomplishment when said butt has a foot growing out of it kicking right back), but the average human would be in some major trouble, just like the Carter family.The father looks like he could handle himself in a fair fight, after all he is a detective, but what are three girls, a boy, a cell phone-selling geek, and a pizza place (maybe two of you will get that lame joke) going to do against a bunch of unnaturally strong psychos? How will they survive? Will it be through might or strategy? You'll have to watch the movie to find out. And if you're squeamish then you'll most likely find yourself cringing in your seat and watching with your hands over your eyes. The Hills Have Eyes is a movie that knows exactly what it needs to do to satisfy its target audience, and it does it well.Case in point... I'm not very vocal during movies. I usually don't clap and scream and hoot and holler like most the dorks sitting around me, but there were a couple of scenes where I literally said aloud, 'Ooooooooooh, crap!' Of course, one of those instances was during a trailer for Phat Girlz, but one scene of violence left my mouth hanging open for about 30 seconds. Then I realized that my mouth was agape like some buffoon, so I quickly closed it.It takes a lot to shock and disturb me these days, so congrats go to The Hills Have Eyes for accomplishing that. It comes at you fast and hard and isn't interested in sugar-coating the violence it's about to serve up. The intensity level starts high and never gives you an opportunity to take a bathroom break. I highly recommend you address any and all bladder issues before the movie begins.For me, the main drawback of the movie was the 'hero.' You can argue that he was more of a 'regular guy' and not a typical macho hero, but I felt he transitioned a little too quickly from a gun-hating wuss to an ax-wielding killing machine. My hat's off to the dog though; that canine rocked! Easily the coolest dog in a movie since the German Shepherd in The Lost Boys.'I like horror movies, Johnny, but I liked to be creeped out more than being subjected to a lot of gore. Would I like this?' It's very doubtful. I'll make this as blunt as possible: this is a movie that contains severed body parts, brutal shootings, axes to the head, a person biting off a bird's head and drinking its blood, and disturbing violence to helpless women.If that description turns you off then you know to save your money. However, if that fits your style then the movie will succeed in giving you exactly what you want. But I have to say that if you think this sounds like fun for the entire family then I'll have to decline any invitations to sit down with you for a family dinner.",7,161,243,14 March 2006
"I, Robot"," A look at why we might not ever want a robot per every household ensues.
","According to Isaac Asimov, the Three Laws of Robotics are:1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.Now you don't have to be a web designer/hilarious movie reviewer with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and an MBA to realize that some sort of interpretation of the old 'rules were made to be broken' adage is gonna take place. And that, my friends, is the nut that the story's shell encases.My friends: Um, what?Oh, uh, sorry, I was just trying to sound cool. Anyway...If you're the type of person who likes to prejudge and make assumptions about movies based on trailers (unlike me, of course), then you may initially think this movie is just all silly action. But that's not the case. Oh, there's definitely some silly and unrealistic action. Whenever you have Will Smith SURFING AWAY FROM AN EXPLOSION ON A FRONT DOOR then you know there's some stuff you're just gonna have to take with two pinches of salt and a dash of sugar, but I, Robot does a good job of developing and revealing its story, all while mixing in the right amount of rump cheek-kicking.There is no denying that the special and visual effects are great, and they are the major selling point for this movie. The car scene in the tunnel is worth the price of admission, and the last 15 or 20 minutes really kick things into 1969 Camaro overdrive. If you've gotta go to the bathroom or get a refill on popcorn, then definitely do it before these last 20 minutes. But I found myself genuinely interested in the story. The movie manages to maintain a good amount of suspense and tension throughout, and it throws in a couple of twists just to keep things fresh. Are the robots as evil as they seem? Is Bruce Greenwood the bad guy he appears to be? Why exactly does Will Smith hate robots so much? Is Alfonso Ribeiro somewhere sucking his thumb and crying, wondering why Will won't return his phone calls?The acting is pretty solid throughout. In general, I like Will Smith. But if you've seen Wild, Wild West then you know he's not immune to starring in crap. Thankfully, that's not the case here. Will Smith pretty much plays Will Smith, so take that for what you think it's worth. He's basically a cop with an attitude who likes to wax sarcastic and be all rebellious and stuff. And he has some good back-and-forths with the ever-adorable Bridget Moynahan who, as Dr. Susan Calvin, is an expert on robot psyches and has great lips - much better than the over-sized bananas Angelina Jolie has plastered below her nose.Going into the movie, I had my reservations. After all, when I first saw the robots in the trailer, I thought they looked about as silly as Tom Cruise with his gray hair in 'Collateral.' But the robot special effects are actually well-done. I came away impressed. They look pretty realistic (more human than Al Gore, to be honest), especially in their mouth movements (George Lucas - take note). And Mrs. Shade made a good point - if you're putting a robot in every home, then you probably don't want it to look evil and menacing. The fight scenes between the robots are quite cool without looking too fake. This is a good sign that we may be moving away from CGI being too obvious.I don't know if I'll add this to my DVD collection, but I definitely want to at least rent the DVD one day, assuming that it's loaded with cool special features. Just one question, which encompasses one of my complaints about the movie, why do so many action movies insist on having a scene where the hero saves an animal in peril? I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY MORE CATS OR DOGS BEING SAVED IN THE NICK OF TIME! I don't want to see animals die or anything, but I'm just tired of pointless 'I must risk my life to save this animal' scenes. It's a cheap ploy to get audiences to go 'Awwwww.' It works, but it makes me dry heave.Rating: 3.5 (out of 5)",Null,63,125,15 July 2004
Over the Hedge," Finally, DreamWorks decides NOT to rely on animal flatulence. Thank you!
","I'm always more than willing to carry the 'DreamWorks ain't got nothing on Pixar!' banner when it comes to the issue of comparing their CGI-animated films. All you have to do is watch Shark Tale (though I don't recommend it) and then compare it to Finding Nemo to understand why.Is it really that hard to find writers that can figure out how to appeal to both adults and children? Anybody can take a big budget and put a lot of impressive CGI on screen (well, except for you, A Sound of Thunder!), but I want something that I actually care to follow. Give me a story that will at least keep my interest, not a bunch of lame puns and outdated M.C. Hammer references that wouldn't have even been funny 15 years ago.Well, you know what? 'What?'DreamWorks has finally done it! Call the neighbors and wake the kids because Over the Hedge kept me consistently entertained. No, it's still not in Toy Story's league, but doggone it they gave it the ol' college try, and I appreciate the solid effort.It helps that Bruce Willis, William Shatner, and Steve Carrell all lend their highly entertaining voices and styles to give us characters that I actually cared about (awww!) and wasn't annoyed by. Granted, Eugene Levy and Wanda Sykes have voices that could inspire me to poke my ear drums out with a kitchen utensil, but thankfully they're not overused, making them surprisingly tolerable.I would warn you not to set your hopes too high though. While there are a handful of laugh-out-loud moments, I was never rolling in the aisles with crazy Benny Hinn-esquire fits of laughter. For the most part this is just a pleasantly amusing film that will make the kids giggle, keep the adults smiling, and keep DreamWorks' pockets heavier than I could ever dream mine to be.",7,11,20,19 May 2006
The Alamo," Not what it could've been
","'The Alamo' is a good, not great, movie. It didn't have quite the emotional impact on me that I hoped it would. My better half, Stephanie, is from Texas, and she felt the same way. There just seems to be something about the pacing that doesn't flow as smoothly as I would've liked. I never truly got the feeling that the Alamo defenders had been inside the walls for 13 days, and the movie could've done a better job of showing the reasons why these men were willing to die behind the walls of an old, abandoned church.Not surprisingly, there are some historical inaccuracies. For one, I really doubt Davy Crockett played the fiddle along with the Mexican Army's band while standing atop the Alamo. It's a funny scene though. Also, historical accounts state that Crockett died while fighting. 'The Alamo' portrays him as being captured and then killed. Don't worry, the movie doesn't get so politically correct as to have him beg for his life or anything. I was scared of that, but thankfully, he died bravely.The biggest omission in the movie is William Barrett Travis drawing a line in the sand with his sword and asking those who are willing to die to cross over the line. All but one man crossed the line. A sick Jim Bowie, legend says, even had his cot carried across the line. The only man not to cross the line was Louis Rose, a French man who'd served in Napoleon's army. Wow, a French man was the one man not willing to fight? Surprise, surprise! Anyway, Rose escaped with his life and told the story.In the movie, Travis does say that anybody who doesn't want to fight can leave, but the scene is not as powerful as it could've been had they gone with the 'line in the sand' story. Why was this left out? I don't know, but it is most unfortunate.Overall, I enjoyed 'The Alamo,' especially when the fighting started. I'm just disappointed that it didn't leave me feeling as charged up and patriotic as something like Mel Gibson's 'The Patriot.' If you have no interest or knowledge in the history of the Alamo, then I fear that this movie will not give you a satisfactory reason as to why so many men were willing to die, and you might find yourself asking why *you* should be willing to invest your interest in the movie.",Null,0,3,14 June 2004
Van Helsing," What you get depends on what you expect
","I'm going to warn you right now: what you get out of 'Van Helsing' completely depends on what you're expecting. I enjoyed the movie, but I really wish it had been a little bit more serious than it was. I was hoping for something along the lines of 'Underworld' with more special effects, but 'Van Helsing' is somewhere between 'The League of Extraordinary Gentleman' and 'The Mummy Returns.' Let me clarify: it's better than LXG, but it has sort of the same cartoonish feel.But the movie has so much going for it that it's hard not to be entertained. You've got a good-looking cast, good-looking scenery, good-looking effects, and a GREAT atmosphere. Women will love Hugh Jackman (I know Stephanie did) and his shirtless self, and the guys (unless you're Richard Simmons) will love Kate Beckinsale (I know I did). Kate and her tight pants presence automatically add two 'targets' to my rating.Keep in mind, there is definitely some cheesy and goofy stuff in the movie that'll make you shake your head. For example, the fake Transylvanian accents really don't help the movie. Why couldn't they have just let Kate talk in her cute little British accent? And Dracula sounds like a mix of Count Chocula and The Count from 'Sesame Street.' I kept expecting him to say, 'Ah-ah-ah. One vampire bride! Ah twoooo vampire brides! Threeeeee vampire brides! Ah-ah-ah.' Where were Booberry and Frankenberry??? Sadly, Richard Roxburgh's Dracula is what hurts the movie most. He isn't menacing at all. If I stumbled upon his lair my biggest danger would be dying from laughter after he started flipping his ponytail around and talking in his silly accent.Steph (my better half): Yeah, but the movie has Hugh Jackman, and you know, he's kind of hot.I'm sure many girls will agree with you, Stephanie, but some moviegoers are looking for more substance than how good someone in the cast looks.Mr. Shade (my friend): Well, Johnny, there's Kate Beckinsale, and you know, she's kind of hot.BOOOYEAH! You got that right, Mr. Shade! HIGH FIVE! *looks around* Oh yeah, I don't do high fives. Um, anyway...Some of the CGI is great. Mr. Hyde looks much better than LXG's version. He's the best bad guy in the movie, showing lots of personality. And I liked the werewolf transformations. But some of the CGI doesn't work so well. For example, there's one scene where a team of horses jumps a broken bridge ... ouch. The only way they could've made it look faker is if Joan Rivers was driving the team.But if you can laugh it off, make fun of it, and enjoy the next round of Van Helsing kicking Monster buttocks then you'll enjoy it. This movie is a loud, fast-paced, action-packed ball of cotton candy. We're talking all-out monster mayhem here. It's a non-stop bombardment of special effects and CGI, and Stephen Sommers' was obviously intent on overpowering us with imagery, so if that sort of thing bothers you then 'Van Helsing' might not be the movie for you.There's also a little humor thrown into the proceedings, most of it coming from Friar Carl (David Wendham) and his less-than-courageous persona. Some of it works, some of it doesn't. Near the end of the movie Mr. Shade turned to me and said that he was hoping Van Helsing, who is fighting monsters in the name of God, would tell one of the baddies, 'I'm gonna hit you with so many left hands of God that you'll be begging for a right hand of God.' That little Chuck Norris tribute would've absolutely ruled. I'm pretty sure most of the audience would've groaned, but I would have laughed heartily.
THE GIST'Van Helsing' isn't all I was hoping it would be, but I quickly accepted that and enjoyed it for what it is - an adrenaline-fueled, CGI monster ride with lots and lots of eye candy. Critics will hate it, and if you're looking for a serious exposition regarding the complex vampire/werewolf world (ala 'Underworld') then guess what, you ain't gettin' it. But if you like your summer blockbuster to be a roller coaster ride with lots of unbelievable, in-your-face action and you can laugh off the silly stuff, then you can have fun with 'Van Helsing.' I did.Steph: Yeah, plus there's Hugh Jackman, and you know, he's kind of hot.Mr. Shade: Kate Beckinsale too!",Null,0,0,6 May 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Prepare to blush as much as you laugh
","All right, here's the deal: if you're easily offended then you might want to stay far, far away from this one. There are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but I probably blushed about as much as I laughed. Actually, I probably blushed MORE than I laughed. And if I wasn't literally blushing on the outside, then I was blushing on the inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame. Whether that's a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder I suppose.I will not deny that I laughed quite a bit, but this is a movie that I simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter. If I were to say, 'This movie is hilarious, go check it out!' and some sweet, little old church-going lady heads to the theater and has a heart-attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations, well, that's just something I don't need on my conscience.So how raunchy is it? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honestly. My mom would've walked out during the first scene. I feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect.There is some cleverly intelligent comedy here, but that's what I come to expect from the man (Judd Apatow) who had a hand in both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. Paul Rudd proclaiming, 'If I hear Ya Mo Be There one more time I'll Ya Mo burn this place down,' is hilarious, but it's one of those things that the majority of the audience won't appreciate.And when we see a quick 3-second flashback of Steve Carrell singing along to Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over, whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it.Strangely enough, despite the raunch, there's an admirable moral to the story. The movie doesn't portray Carrell as some freaky loser just because he's a virgin. He's really portrayed as a likable, admirable character. Sure, he's a little weird. After all, he has a framed Asia poster, 'more videogames than an Asian kid,' and a toy collection that features the Million Dollar Man's BOSS, but we're never led to believe that there's actually anything wrong with the fact that he's a virgin. As odd as it may seem, there's a bit of an 'it's OK to wait' message.But man, oh man, please be warned that this pushes its R rating about as far as it can go. That was certainly Apatow's intention. According to him, he just let some of the guys (particularly Rogen and Malco) improv and talk the way they normally talk, all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty. If you can handle that or talk that way yourself, then you'll love the movie.I'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes. I find that subtle, clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f-word or fratboy sex discussions. But that's me. Like I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if they're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to ever see at the theater. I just don't know how interested most women will be in what's discussed by men while playing poker. Honestly ladies, you might not want to know. If you've ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross, well, this gives you a good idea.There you go - my humble, honest take on what to expect. Be that your guide. It definitely should not be seen with your Sunday School class, mama, grandmama, any family members of the opposite sex, children of any age, or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion. If you'd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable.",7,176,324,18 August 2005
Jarhead," Entertaining for a while, but where's the needed release?
","Jarhead - slang for Marine. It describes the high and tight haircut that resembles a jar. The movie follows one such Jarhead's (Bubble Boy's Jake Gyllenhaal) experiences as a Marine from boot camp to training to Desert Shield to Desert Storm. We watch as the war swells from 14 minutes and 5000 troops in the desert to 175 days and 575,000 troops in the desert.The Marine's labor? They wait. The movie audience's labor? We wait. For something, anything to happen. The soldiers make scorpions fight each other and they bet on who will win. They dance around naked to Naughty by Nature's OPP. I nearly vomit. They pull pranks. They wait for letters. They get bored. Very bored.I hesitate to call Jarhead a 'war movie' because it has little to do with the actual war. It focuses more on how the soldiers try to fight their boredom while waiting for some action. This is an interesting take ... up to a point. But after a while the audience starts to become as frustrated as the Marines. These guys want to kill. They trained to kill! An exasperated Gyllenhaal even asks, 'Are we ever going to get to kill anybody?' I was wondering the same thing. I wanted to see a little fighting. Maybe a cool sniper kill or two. Just like the soldiers, I wanted some release.Maybe it was the director's intention to put the audience in the shoes of the weary soldiers. If so, then mission accomplished. The problem with this approach is that it hampers the storytelling. There's no smooth flow to the narrative. After a while you're left wondering if there is a point other than, 'Hey, there were some soldiers who didn't see much action and they got bored!' As such, Jarhead feels like a dramatized documentary.I was a little concerned that the movie would be a big political statement, but it stays away from trying to polarize its audience. Any parallel lines drawn between then and now are subtle and temperate. Some guys wanted in, some wanted out, and some just looked like they had nothing better to do. One of my favorite moments comes when Booty Call's Jamie Foxx talks about how there's nothing more he wants to do than be a Marine. This scene, set against the backdrop of the dark desert lit by burning oil fields, is a great visual to behold.But ultimately I never got the release or the closure that I was waiting for. Instead of sending the audience home on a high note, the director tempts us to slit our wrists at the revelation of the post-war fate of one of the main characters. We're not told how this character came to his fate, though I have my assumption, but the 'how' doesn't matter. No explanation would dilute the depression that we're left with.",6,2,4,22 November 2005
Collateral," The worst hairdo of Tom Cruise's career ensues.
","Slick, stylish, atmospheric. All words used to describe Johnny Betts' hair. But they're also equally applicable to Michael Mann's latest creation, Collateral. Folks, you know a movie has to be good when I'm actually enjoying conversation between Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. In fact, the dialogue is one of the strongest points of the film. It's very reminiscent of a Movie Mark review - smart, witty, and sometimes dark.Collateral is not for the weak of heart. It's an engrossing experience that'll grab you after the first 10 or 15 minutes, and then it'll proceed to slap around your senses for well over an hour. One moment you'll gasp at a ruthless display of violence by ol' silver glint himself, Tom Cruise, and then the next minute you'll feel guilty for laughing at a bit of dark humor that you know wouldn't be funny if you saw it on the street.Collateral is that type of movie. It's harsh, and it's brutal, but it's hard to look away from.Just to get my point across even stronger, let me point out three things:1) I'm no Tom Cruise fan. 2) I've never liked Jamie Foxx. 3) I didn't think I'd be able to get past Cruise's hilariously ridiculous gray hair.Considering all that, I never thought I'd be saying this, but if it weren't for the last 15 or so minutes of the movie then Collateral would be a contender for movie of the year. Everything about the movie is smart and fresh, and that's what makes the ending so frustrating. But more on that later.As I've pointed out many times in my life, I've never been a fan of Tom Cruise. Sometimes expecting me to buy the 5'4' Cruise as a mega action star is asking a little bit too much from me, but I've gotta give him credit here. This is probably the best I've seen him. I think part of the attraction is that he's a bad guy; therefore you get to root against him. Well, I always root against him, but now I have the pleasure of knowing all the fanboys are obliged to as well. He plays the character of a cold-blooded assassin perfectly. But he does it in such a way that sometimes you'll find yourself rooting for him, hoping for some sort of redemption. 'Hmm, maybe he's not really that bad!' you'll say. Conflicting emotions like this are what I want to experience when watching a movie, so bravo to all involved.And then there's Jamie Foxx. I used to think he was a Wayans brother. In fact, when he was on In Living Color I always referred to him as the 'unfunny Wayans brother.' He shows here that he's much better at drama than comedy because, well, he really isn't funny when he's trying to be. At the beginning of the movie Jada Pinkett Smith, who plays a lawyer, tells Foxx that she has a fear that, 'the jury's gonna laugh at me.' I was hoping she would turn to Foxx and add, 'I know that's something *you* don't have to worry about.' Ah well. Foxx handles the role well. It's especially interesting to watch his character transformation.Now the disappointment. This is a movie that was heading for 4+ marks. I was sitting there thinking, 'Man, if this ends as smartly and sharply as it has played out thus far, this could work its way up to a 4.5!' Unfortunately, as the movie begins to wind down it all becomes a little too contrived. I was willing to overlook the action movie clichÃƒÂ©s: the cell phone's batteries die at the worst possible time, people are marathon sprinting but for some unknown reason they are not BREATHING HEAVY like a normal human, and does Tom Cruise have a contract that every movie he's in has to feature him in an all-out sprint?Like I said, I was willing to look past all of that, but the final confrontation followed suit and just didn't satisfy. The thing that made me mad is that it was out of character with what we saw throughout the rest of the movie. That's all I'll say here because I don't want to give too much away. It's not a horrible ending, but in light of how intelligently crafted the rest of the movie is, it's a disappointment.Heat had a great, smart, bittersweet ending, and I was expecting the same here. It's just a shame that Collateral went from about an hour and forty-five minutes of a movie you would never expect Jamie Foxx to be in to about 15 minutes of a summer action flick you *would* expect him to star in. It reminds me of my senior year of high school. It was the last couple of weeks of school, I already had my college scholarship, and my baseball team was in the regional playoffs, so why did I have any interest in reading A Tale of Two Cities? For the first time in my life, I slipped things into cruise control and read the Cliff Notes. I got a C on the test. Mann's done the same thing. He pulled out the Cliff Notes on how to end a Summer action movie. But hey, I still made an 'A' for the six weeks. Similarly, Collateral walks away as a truly worthwhile experience.THE GIST:Just like he did with Heat way back in 1995, Mann has created another stylish, engrossing thriller. If you like tension, sharp dialogue, and great interaction between adversaries then Collateral is a must-see. Just make sure you can handle a little in-your-face violence, and please be willing to forgive the climax. The rest of the ride is well worth it.Rating: 3.5 marks (out of 5)",Null,0,1,6 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," An honest review from a non-fan
","I feel obligated to preface this review by saying I'm not a big Harry Potter fan. I haven't read any of the books, and this may surprise you, but I haven't seen either of the first two movies. So I'm asking all you Harry Potter marks not to cry too hard at the fact that this review won't be a total praise-fest. OK, now that I've gotten that out of the way, we may proceed.For me, this is what I would consider mild entertainment. It's not a bad movie. In fact, I thought it was quite entertaining in parts. Case in point, the special effects are very good. I thought the Dementors were pretty cool, and I was especially impressed with the half-horse, half-eagle hippogriff. That thing looked surprisingly real. And there were some nice moments of humor as well - particularly when Harry made his Aunt Marge puff up and float away like a big balloon. But to be honest, after all the hype I was really hoping to be blown away, and I just wasn't. It's hard not to have high expectations when this is the typical conversation I have with a Harry Potter fan:Harry Potter mark: Whoa, wait a minute, you mean you haven't seen either of the Harry Potter movies? What's your problem?Johnny: I don't have a problem; I just don't have much interest inHarry Potter.Harry Potter mark: BUT THEY'RE GOOD MOVIES YOU JERK!Johnny: Fine, give me $4 and I'll rent one of 'em.Harry Potter mark: *shakes head and walks away*I must admit, reactions such as the above led me to believe I must be missing out on the next Star Wars or something, but now that I've seen a Harry Potter movie I know I wasn't missing a life-altering event. A lot of adults love the Harry Potter movies, but for me this just had a little too much of a 'kid's movie' feel to it. The story just didn't grab me.Harry Potter is the type of movie I probably would've enjoyed a LOT more when I was young, and especially if I had read the books. I think my biggest hang-up is the characters. My type of fantasy movie is Star Wars. I like a tough guy hero (or anti-hero) like Han Solo, and I want a vicious, unmerciful bad guy like Darth Vader. Harry Potter, as a hero, just doesn't do it for me. Radcliffe doesn't do a bad job, but the fact that he looks like SNL's Rachel Dratch really doesn't pump me up to root for him. And Ronald the red-headed kid, man, his incessant whining and frowning annoyed me more than watching an episode of Oprah.It sounds like I'm being pretty harsh, but I know the Harry Potter fans are rabidly loyal, and I just love poking fun at things the fanboys love so passionately. If you're a Harry Potter fan, then you'll love this movie. My brother liked it a lot and said he thought it was better than the Sorcerer's Stone (he hasn't seen the Chamber of Secrets yet), and most everybody in the theater enjoyed it as well. So don't take my fun-loving jabs too personally. Go see the movie and have a good time.THE GIST'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is sure to give fans of the series exactly what they want, especially in regard to the top-notch special effects. I'm not a Harry Potter fan, and this movie didn't do enough to make me a convert, but I still found it mildly entertaining if not mind-blowing. If you loved the previous two movies then you won't be disappointed.",Null,0,0,3 June 2004
The Amazing Spider-Man," The law of creativity trumps the law of gravity
","As a child growing up in the 80s, I was fortunate that my imagination was not burdened by as many technological trappings that plague kids today. Sure, I had my Atari and Nintendo, but beyond that I had a group of creative friends and a few backyards that became various universes. And while I was blessed to have many real heroes in my life, I still had a fascination for a few superheroes that weren't limited by the laws of gravity and physics. Batman and Spider-Man were always my favorites, and I may or may not have had the footie pajamas to prove it.That sense of wonder didn't end as a child. The magic of the movies can still create a bond with those memories of old when it's done right. On one hand, Christopher Nolan has found a way to expertly filter the Batman universe through the perspective of my adult mind. On the other hand, my inner child still relates to a character like Spider-Man. Not only did I love the fact that he was just a geeky kid who stood up to bullies, but let's be honest â€“ his mask is awesome.But, like many, I was skeptical about a new franchise so soon after the Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire incarnation. Those films had their flaws (particularly Kirsten Dunst and the lack of any semblance of chemistry between her and Maguire), but the first two were highly enjoyable. Was a reboot necessary? Was it needed this soon? Then I thought about Maguire's stupid disco dancing in Spider-Man 3 and I began to think, 'You know what, why not? Let's give somebody else a shot at this.' That thought and a couple of promising trailers later, and I was a little more on board. Now I had to be sold.Consider the sell complete.Sure, this is familiar territory. So what? Director Marc Webb has found a way to take a story most of us already know and put a fresh spin on it. I have many friends who will probably call me a traitor for this, but I loved Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. In fact, I think he's even more believable than the aforementioned Maguire. He creates a likable, relatable character who is as awkward with the ladies as most of us guys were in high school, and he gives Spider-Man just enough sense of humor without stepping over the line into cheesiness. The scene where he 'cowers' at a small knife demonstrates what I mean.We also get a better glimpse at just how intelligent he is. For example, we see that Peter's web-shooting ability is his own creation, as it was originally presented in the comics.Garfield's chemistry with Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy is handled with both believability and subtlety. I couldn't care less about the absence of Mary Jane. In the comics, Gwen was Spidey's first love, and Ms. Stone portrays her with just the right combination of intelligence and sass.Rhys Ifans is also a stand-out as Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. He takes a character that isn't as widely beloved as others in the Spider-Man universe, and he creates a villain that is downright menacing at times and sympathetic at others. We get more than just a one-note bad guy with little more than world domination as his goal. Ifans delivers a character struggling with severe inner conflict who has both evil and redemption at his fingertips.With a budget estimated at more than $200 million, the cinematography and action sequences are as beautiful as you would expect, providing the excitement and wonder that kids and adults alike desire when sitting down to be taken into a different world. And while the film hits all the right adventurous notes; it's the relationships and the actors who develop them that give the film its heart.Call me sappy, but I couldn't help but feel the film's climax is as heroic as it is thrilling. Not only was I immersed in what was happening on screen, but I was briefly transported to my backyard when burdens were light, stress was low, and imagination was high.Complain about reboots if you want. Whine about inconsistencies with the original comic if it makes you feel better. As for me, that stuff never bothered me as a child, and it's not something that bothers me now. All I ask for with a movie like this is to be taken to a different world where the laws of gravity and physics matter less than the law of creativity, and The Amazing Spider-Man does just that.Batman is still my all-time favorite superhero, but Spider-Man is close behind. Even if I don't still have the footie pajamas to prove it.Honestly, I don't! But I will take the mask...",8,0,2,3 July 2012
The Butterfly Effect," It takes you out of your comfort zone
","Intense. Shocking. Disturbing. All words used to describe Johnny Betts' reviews. But, these words equally refer to 'The Butterfly Effect.' I don't care what the critics say; I like this movie. It's original, it's totally unpredictable, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Formulaic, it most definitely is not.One of the big questions people have about this movie is, 'Can Ashton Kutcher pull off a serious role?' I'm here to say that Ashton and his 'look at how serious I am' beard managed to impress me. You've gotta understand that Ashton is being asked to portray a character that not only had some very traumatic childhood moments, but it's also a character who has been stuck with the same hair cut for the past 10 years. I'd like to see Tom Hanks pull that off!After the screening I heard an older woman say, 'Wow, I didn't know Ashton Kutcher could act like that.' I think a lot of people are going to have the same reaction. I had my reservations going in, but I felt he stepped up to the task and held his own.The rest of the cast does a good job as well. Most notably, Amy Smart (best known as Noel's girlfriend on 'Felicity') turns in an admirable performance. Thanks to the time travel aspect of the movie, her character was required to reflect several different personality types. She handled this very well and showed good range. And Eric Stoltz climbed out of whatever rock he's been under to effectively play the sleaze ball pedophile dad of Amy's character. Is this movie for the faint of heart? No way. It has possibly some of the most disturbing images I've seen in a movie since 'Seven.' It's not overly gory though. This movie disturbs you the most with what is implied rather than what is shown. You see what's *about* to happen and then it's up to you to form the image in your own mind.Is this movie totally plausible? Of course not. I've actually heard some critics complain that you have to 'suspend disbelief' too much. Come on, it's about a guy who can hop scotch through time and fill in the blanks of his childhood! It's called a CONCEPT! Ever heard of judging a movie based on whether or not it works within the concept?? If you're the type of person who complains about the scientific accuracy of EVERY single movie you see, then consider yourself warned.'So Johnny, what exactly is the 'Butterfly Effect'?' Ah, good question. It's an illustration of the chaos theory, which states that, 'the beating of butterfly wings in China can affect the course of an Atlantic hurricane' (Douglas Adams). Once Evan realizes he can fill in the blanks of his past, he tries to do so in such a way that the future will be changed for the better. But as his dad tries to warn him, 'You can't change who people are without destroying who they were.'",Null,0,2,14 June 2004
Alien vs. Predator," One plot contrivance leads to another, and the next thing you know a massive war between Aliens, Predators, and humans ensues.
","Is there really any need for me to review this movie? Critics are gonna hate it, women and the elderly will try to avoid it, and fanboys will go see it no matter what. But I try to convince myself that my voice is *always* needed, so here we go.If you have no interest in seeing this movie, then I really have no incentive to convince you otherwise. If you've already cleared your calendar and got your tickets, well, you probably don't have a girlfriend. But that's irrelevant. Much like you have to do whenever you go on a date, I suggest you lower your expectations right now. If you do that, then you might just come away somewhat entertained. There's no guarantee, but at least your chances will be better. Certainly better than getting that second date. *rimshot* I'm sorry; I just like to give fanboys a hard time.AvP (as the hipsters like to call it) is not what I'd classify as a 'good movie,' but at times it does pass for entertainment. I was never bored, and it kept my interest, so hey, I don't regret seeing it, but my biggest disappointment is that this could have been so much better.The plot is pretty hokey, but I won't give it away just in case you prefer to wait for the revelation during the movie. However, I will tell you that the actual revelation is beyond cheesy. Here's the deal. The humans make their way down to the pyramid, we find out that the mother alien is dormant in the pyramid, and we see that the Predators are in their spaceship and they're headed to ... yep, you guessed it ... the pyramid. So I'm sitting in the theater thinking, 'So what's the connection? I hope they explain what's going on.' No problem. Thankfully, a member of Henriksen's team can read hieroglyphics, and lo and behold, there are hieroglyphics in the pyramid! But wait, that's not the best part. Somebody actually took the time to write out the entire plot of the movie in hieroglyphics in the pyramid! So dude proceeds to read the plot summary to us as we're treated to a flashback. Give me a break. That's the best they could come up with? Couldn't they have, you know, put forth a modicum of effort and somehow developed the plot within the context of the movie? And don't get your hopes up, the connection between the three races isn't exactly sci-fi ingenuity.Some more laughable moments involve an Aztec calendar and the reconfiguration of the pyramid. One of the guys from the team claims that since the Aztec calendar was based on multiples of 10 then this must mean that the pyramid was designed around that. Of course, that's the solution to all their problems. This is supposed to explain why the pyramid reconfigures itself every 10 minutes. Whatever, man, just whatever.And yes, I realize that I'm referring to characters as 'dude' and 'one of the guys,' and believe me, you'll be doing the same thing if you go see the movie. Long gone are the days of Arnold and Ventura. Now say hello to... well, I don't really remember anybody's name, and I didn't really care to either. It's sufficient to say there's a bunch of people with accents, and we all know that accents are used in an effort to disguise bad acting.One good thing about having mostly unknowns is that you don't know exactly who will die and who will live. However, one bad thing about having mostly unknowns is that there's a good chance they can't act and most likely won't convince you to care about them. I shed not one tear over any character's death. Did Mr. Scientist Geek just get killed? Yeehaw. Go Predator.Oh, and I'm just curious. If you came face-to-face with an alien, and this was the first realization of alien existence, what would you say? Would you be speechless? Or would you say, 'You want a piece of me?' I didn't think so. One other thing I need to address is the PG-13 rating. A lot of fans are upset about this, and well, you should be. The result is that this movie is fun for the whole family! Seriously, except for an 'f' word, this is safe even for pre-teens. I don't think they should've had additional profanity (typically a sign of lazy writing), but this is a movie that should be overflowing with Alien/Predator gore and violence. Instead, we get a few sanitized fights with very little gore and very little slime. Some of the fights are cool, but there aren't enough, and they aren't as chaotic as they should be.I'm also not a fan of the Predator with a heart of gold. There was a scene near the end where, I kid you not, I thought the Predator and Sanaa Lathan were going to kiss. Somebody in the theater actually said, 'Oooh, she's gonna kiss him!' Folks, if you're a fan of the original Predator then you know that there shouldn't even be the threat of that happening! I have no idea what they were thinking there.Let me end with a piece of advice for you. If you ever find yourself going one-on-one with a Predator and it turns its back and starts to walk away, man, just let it walk. THE GIST  Do you love movies that are filmed in a lot of dark locations with a lot of spooky music playing in the background all while characters are walking around slowly? Does this scare you and keep you entertained no matter how simplistic and silly the plot is? If so, then Alien Vs. Predator should keep you entertained. However, if you're expecting this to just completely blow your mind then I recommend lowering the bar of your expectations before entering the theater and try not to sob too much over the missed opportunities.",Null,1,2,13 August 2004
Meet the Fockers," A slapstick sitcom version that is a shadow of its predecessor
","When you're making a sequel to a very successful movie, you've really got a lot to live up to. Some sequels take that challenge and work hard to live up to or exceed expectations. Even if the sequel doesn't exceed the original, you hope it'll at least give a valiant effort. Meet the Fockers, however, went with a different approach. It takes everything that worked in the first movie, throws it out the door, and substitutes it with lame, formulaic, and repetitive gags.Don't believe me? Here are a few jokes that were not only run into the ground, but were buried 10 feet beneath it and covered with cement: * A dog humping stuff. Is that still considered funny? If you think so, then is it funny to repeat the gag about 5 times WITHIN ONE MOVIE??? If you think so, then may I ask why you set your comedic bar so low? * Barbra Streisand is a sex therapist. Oooh look, she works with old people! She teaches them how to lap dance! Hardy har. I wasn't able to laugh at that because I was too busy trying to avoid throwing up on the person sitting in front of me. Plus, Streisand has lots of sex books and statues, so you know that's rife with unoriginal jokes that we've seen plenty of times in other less-than-spectacular movies. And folks, the last thing I needed to see in life was Streisand's boobs covered in whip cream. Sheesh. Well, maybe that's not the *last* thing I needed to see, but it's not high on my list.* Dustin Hoffman is a big IL' goof-ball! Wackiness and goofiness is fine, but within the context of this movie it would've worked better if it were done in a believable fashion. Hoffman's character sits on the toilet while De Niro takes a shower ... IN THE SAME BATHROOM! Is that believable? Hoffman's character used to be a lawyer, so you'd assume he'd have some sort of intelligence. Now if De Niro had gotten out of the shower and straight-up kicked Hoffman in the face, then THAT would've been funny, but he just politely asks for some privacy. And come on, am I really expected to laugh when Hoffman dances and falls into a food table? That's the best the writers could come up with? I suppose that might work in a high school skit on 'club day,' but it really doesn't cut it when you're making a major motion picture.* The overuse of puns on the 'Focker' name. Been there, done that. Something new, clever, and original would've been nice.There was a lot of potential here. You knew Stiller's parents had to be crazy, so there was room for loads of laughs once they met up with Mr. CIA Robert De Niro. Unfortunately, it's a concept that is much better in theory than it was in its execution. Hoffman and Streisand just didn't do it for me, plus the fact that I inherently dislike Streisand didn't help.I still think they should've used Jerry Stiller (Ben's real dad) and Estelle Harris. If you remember, they were George Costanza's parents on Seinfeld, and they're two of the most dysfunctional parents to ever appear on television. I think they (or two characters who were similarly neurotic) would've worked much better.There are some laughs here but nothing to compare to the original. I was never really bored, but I never did more than politely chuckle or smile. Were my expectations too high? Not really because I didn't expect this to be as good as the first. My main disappointment comes from knowing that this *could* have been really good.I know a lot of people at the screening really enjoyed it. I guess some people are just more willing to settle for a slapstick sitcom version that is a shadow of its predecessor than I am.THE GIST Meet the Fockers isn't horrible, and I never felt compelled to sprint for the exit (except for when Streisand was teaching the old people how to lap dance), but there just aren't any sidesplitting, aisle-rolling guffaws here. If you don't set your comedic bar very high, then you may be satisfied. But if, like me, you're a big fan of Meet the Parents, then you, like I, might be sorely disappointed with this sequel.I would suggest waiting to make this a rental, but if you're dying to see it on the big screen then make it a matinÃ©e.",Null,7,18,22 December 2004
Cars," 'It's kind of nice to slow down every once in a while.'
","'Cars didn't ride on it to make great time; they rode on it to have a great time.' It's not hard to make a successful movie. It's simple, really. Exceed my expectations. Make me feel. Force me to care. Deliver a somewhat clichÃ©d message, but deliver it in such a way that the meaning resounds. Teach me the same lessons that your characters learn. And above all, entertain.Pretty easy, right? Well, at least Pixar makes it look that way because with Cars they have once again succeeded.I'll be honest; I had my doubts about the movie. How would they be able to take a story featuring nothing but vehicles, with nary a human in sight, and keep my interest for a full two hours? Animals are one thing, but could Pixar successfully master the personification of modes of transportation? Yes, they could, and they did.Thanks to Director Lasseter's strong attention to detail, going so far as to insist that the vehicles bend and gesture in ways that were true to their construction, every car and truck truly becomes a unique character and personality. And along with those characters and personalities comes a story which yes, contains a well-traveled theme, but it comes with so much charm that even Grouchy McKilljoy's hard little heart can't help but be warmed.Don't worry if you're not a racing fan; I assure you it's not a requirement to enjoy the movie. I love watching muscle cars race the quarter mile (ask me about my '69 Camaro), but NASCAR doesn't do it for me. That's another aspect about the film that gave me pause. I once fell asleep at a NASCAR qualifying race, despite the 90-degree heat and ear-splitting decibel levels, so would Cars keep me awake and interested? Within five minutes my worries began to slowly subside as I happily settled in for the ride.Animation should be about bringing imagination to life. Give us something that can't be done in live action. Cars does this so effectively that it almost seems a redundancy to comment on how Pixar continues to raise the CGI bar. The scenery on screen is awe-inducing to the point that it's getting harder to distinguish the real from the created. The filmmakers have gone so far as to perfect reflections in the cars and to pay careful attention to weeds growing out of cracks in the sidewalk. I don't see any way you could not be visually stunned.But impressive visuals are little comfort if I'm not presented with a story that I care to follow. No problems there. If you're the kind of person who loves to go 'awwwww' at movies then prepare to be satisfied. What I appreciate the most is that, at the risk of causing some youngsters to become restless, time and attention has been given to character and story development. Lasseter and his team stood their ground and resisted any pressure to trim this to a runtime more suitable to those with limited attention spans, and I thank them for it.As I said earlier, Cars hit the starting line with a disadvantage. I didn't greet it with a warm smile. I crossed my arms, furrowed my brow, and dared it to prove my preconceived notions wrong.It proceeded to exceed my expectations. It made me feel for its characters and forced me to care about McQueen's journey, both to California and to a different viewpoint on life. Sure, the 'slow down and enjoy the scenery' message may seem a little routine, but it's a message I took to heart.Immediately following the movie I was on the Internet looking up information regarding Route 66. I'm now ready for a road trip void of interstates and efforts to beat my best time. I feel like slowing down a bit and exploring the unknown. Give me the scenic route, and give me more finely-tuned, detailed movies like Cars. That's all I ask. Two hours of entertainment that make me care, even if briefly, about something other than myself and what goal has to be accomplished next.See? It was simple, really. At least Pixar made it look that way.",8,211,244,9 June 2006
Hellboy," Why does Hellboy look like Ted Danson?
","Looking for a fast-paced, comic book action movie consisting of the good guy beating up a wide variety of super cool bad guys? Weeeeeell, you better just keep on lookin'. 'Hellboy' doesn't provide any of that. Oh, Hellboy does beat up a predator-looking creature called Sammael about 7 times, but surprisingly there is a severe lack of monsters in this movie. And you know a movie is in trouble when the main hero looks like a sunburned Ted Danson with table legs sticking out of his head.Prior to seeing the movie, I assumed it would be pretty cheesy, but I at least thought it was going to be fast-paced and action-packed. Thought wrong. The movie's first hour is pretty slow. There are a couple of good action scenes, but after about an hour I was still waiting for it to kick things into high gear. I just knew that the second hour was gonna be non-stop action and monster fighting mayhem! Nope. Things just get even slower. At that point I started checking my watch frequently and was fighting really hard to stay awake.The insertion of a love story into the proceedings didn't help matters either. I'll admit that it was funny when Hellboy got a little jealous of Liz and Agent Myers, but at the end of the movie when Hellboy and Liz are surrounded in blue fire and sharing a 'Dawson's Creek' moment was just bad.Ron Perlman as Hellboy is the highlight of the movie. He does a good job, and although the character is silly looking, he's still charming. He had some funny lines, but he also had some really cheesy ones that you'd expect to come from Van Damme's mouth.If you're hoping 'Hellboy' is a comic book adaptation in the same vein as X-Men, then you have truly misplaced your hope. What we have here is a comic book adaptation that somehow manages to move at a much slower pace than 'Daredevil' and actually gives 'Spawn' a run for its money in it's ability to not meet expectations. And folks, my expectations weren't that high in the first place.THE GIST  If you like slow-paced comic book movies that lack any sort of depth, action, or character development, then 'Hellboy' might be the movie for you. I'm sure the fanboys will find something to like in the movie, but those unfamiliar with the comic book (i.e. most everybody) should save their money for something else. If you insist on going, then take a pillow and I dare you to get the image of 'Ted Danson as Hellboy' out of your head.Rating: 2 (out of 5)",Null,0,0,16 June 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Show me a fighter who's nothing but heart, and I'll show you a man who's waiting for a beatin'.
","Masterpiece. Engrossing. Heartbreaking. All words that describe a Johnny Betts movie review. But they can also be used to describe Clint Eastwood's latest project - Million Dollar Baby. Make no mistake about it; I'm a huge Eastwood mark. So you might be inclined to believe that since I'm a fan, I'm just gonna praise whatever he does. That's not entirely true though. The man has an Oscar resting comfortably upon his shelf, so he certainly doesn't need my validation.Clint is no stranger to critical success, but for my money Million Dollar Baby is a better movie than his other two most heralded movies - Unforgiven (which I felt was overrated and one of Clint's weaker Westerns) and Mystic River, Clint's Oscar-hyped wristslitter of 2003. They all have their merits, but Million Dollar Baby has a fascinating combination of deliberate, gripping storytelling, great acting, sparse but well-placed music, engaging drama, and subtle humor that the others don't have. Oh, and the boxing in the movie is very realistic, nothing fancy or over-the-top.Speaking of boxing, the word alone is enough to turn off some viewers. One of the first responses I get whenever I start explaining the plot to this movie is, 'Oh, I don't like boxing movies, so I probably won't like it.' One thing you need to understand is that this is not a boxing movie. It's a movie about human relationships that just happens to use boxing as its backdrop.There's the relationship between Frankie and Scrap. Frankie worked as a cut man for Scrap many years ago, and twenty-three years later, Frankie still feels responsible for Scrap losing sight in his right eye after a particularly brutal fight. But their friendship has remained strong. Clint and Freeman display such a great chemistry that you actually feel like they've been friends for over twenty years. Well, I did at least. They sound like an old married couple at times, arguing over silly things like the holes in Scrap's socks or Frankie's less-than-jovial demeanor. The dialogue is funny and crisp without being overly eloquent. Exactly what you'd expect from a couple of guys who've been around boxing their whole lives.Then there's the father/daughter relationship between Frankie and Maggie. Frankie has no relationship with his actual daughter - as evidenced by the fact that the letters he sends her every week always return un-opened and marked 'Return to sender.' We never really find out why his daughter hates him so much, but I assume his involvement in the boxing business kept him from being around her, and she hasn't forgiven him. Maggie's dad died when she was young, but Frankie reminds her a lot of him. Once he starts to train her, Frankie is really the only person she can depend on, and they form a strong bond that both were previously missing in their lives.Hilary Swank, as Maggie, is impressive enough to finally make us all forget about The Core. I didn't expect to like her character very much, so I walked away pleasantly surprised. Her southern accent just sounded too fake in the trailers, but I got used to it, and I was shocked to find myself caring about Maggie. Note to Hilary: KEEP YOUR HAIR LONG! I like the movie's straight-forward message about how sometimes in life, having the heart and desire to do something isn't always enough. It's like Frankie says, 'Show me a fighter who's nothing but heart, and I'll show you a man who's waiting for a beatin'.' It's not a lesson a lot of people want to hear, but it's just the kick in the pants that a lot of people need.I wasn't as pleased, however, with the movie's ending. And this is something that might cause a lot of people to be really upset. I can't say much because I'd give too much away, but I can say that a couple of characters make some decisions I don't condone. But it's done in a way not to be preachy. A character is even advised against taking a certain course of action, and then the audience is left to see what choice is made.In a recent interview, Clint was asked about the controversial ending, and he replied, 'I'm just telling a story. I don't advocate. I'm playing a part. I've gone around in movies blowing people away with a .44 magnum. But that doesn't mean I think that's a proper thing to do.' That's honestly the best way to look at it.Is the ending depressing? Sure. Do I have my own ideas of how the movie could've ended on a better note? Yep. But that's life. Reality isn't always pretty, and this movie does a good job of capturing that realism, regardless of whether we agree with certain decisions or not. You can choose to put a situation in God's hands, or you can attempt to solve it on your own. You just have to be willing to accept the consequences of your decision.THE GIST Million Dollar Baby is simple at its core - a movie that uses great performances to do a great job of storytelling. If you're a fan of anybody in the cast and you can handle something with a less-than-cheerful ending, then Million Dollar Baby will keep your interest. Just make sure you bring some Kleenex. But if you prefer to walk out of a movie whistling and tapping your feet, then I suggest looking elsewhere.Oh, and guys, if you happen to notice a salty liquid substance forming around the rims of your eyes, then don't worry too much. It's like the Memphis Tigers football coach (Tommy West) says, 'Men don't cry, their eyes sweat.' Keep that excuse handy, and you'll be fine.",Null,0,0,28 January 2005
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Once again, the 'mainstream' critics are wrong.
","Here's a warning to all movie snobs - STAY AWAY! Everybody else go have a good time. I really enjoyed the movie, but let me fill you in on where I'm coming from:1) I like the Resident Evil video games. 2) I love watching Milla kick decayed zombie butt. 3) I love the addition of another hot babe who knows how to kick decayed zombie butt.If you identify with the above, then this is the movie for you. Also, keep in mind that a person's level of enjoyment for a movie like this goes down as his age goes up. Let me put this in fundamental terms: this is all about Milla in tight outfits, shooting guns, back flipping off motorcycles, breaking zombie necks, and just looking mighty fine doing it all. Folks, that's all I really need sometimes. Oh, and Sienna Guillory doesn't exactly open the eyes of the Oscar voters, but she sure makes a sexy Jill Valentine!Atmosphere plays a big part as well. Things are often loud, dark, and chaotic. So you can expect a booming soundtrack, a handful of jump scenes, and a whole lot of gory deaths. My main complaint is that sometimes things are a little too chaotic, especially in some fight scenes. The camera is too close to fully absorb everything that's happening. Come on cameramen, pull back a little.One thing many zombie movies lack is a main antagonist. Characters usually have to deal with a bunch of generic zombies chasing after them, but that's not the case here. Nemesis is one scary monstrosity. I've played the video game, and he's something you don't want on your tail. The addition of the Lickers (creatures from the game) is also a nice touch. The CGI is well done.If you're in the mood for an all-out, non-stop thrill ride that is intent on preventing you from catching your breath, and you don't insist on the deepest story in the world, then there's really no reason not to see Resident Evil: Apocalypse. And ladies, I know I've gone on about the lovely Milla, but if you have the slightest interest in zombie movies or you just like fast-paced action with a serving of gore, then there's plenty for you to enjoy as well.In terms of pure entertainment value this falls between 3.5 and 4 marks. I'm gonna shake up my rating system and give it a 3.75!!! It's Friday; you never know what kind of wild antics I might get up to.THE GISTPlease don't go into this movie expecting anything resembling realism. Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a movie based on a video game, and in my opinion, it's exactly what a video game inspired movie should be. It's gory, it's violent, it's got lots of heavy artillery, it's got a super cool villain, it's got well-toned heroines puttin' on a show ... in other words, this is the movie most adrenaline-fueled guys have been waiting for all year.",Null,3,5,10 September 2004
Brave," The 'Pixar magic' is, much like Tom Cruise's sanity, lacking.
","Visually stunning, but substantially lacking, Brave checks in near the bottom of my favorite Pixar movies list, right next to Ratatouille. Sure, the cinematography is beautiful and the effects are top-notch. But this is Pixar. I don't expect anything less. There are simply some parts of the job that you should always do well. Don't fix me a beautifully garnished barbecue platter and then expect a pat on the back when it turns out the plate actually has very little barbecue on it. Brave contains several nice elements, but the 'Pixar magic' is, much like Tom Cruise's sanity, lacking.A lot of my disappointment hinges on the film's inability to meet my expectations, and that fault rests on the shoulders of the marketing department. Whoever put together the trailer needs a lesson on 'false advertisement.' After I initially saw the trailer for Brave I thought, 'Cool. Looks like Pixar is taking the concept of Braveheart, animating it, creating a female protagonist, and making it fun for the whole family. I'm on board! They'll never take OUR FREEDOM!' Unfortunately, the film takes a weird turn about halfway through and puts its own twist on the ol' 'mother and daughter trying to repair their relationship' dynamic. Now before you skewer me and throw me on the grill, please keep in mind that I did enjoy the film. I just never could get excited about it. It starts off slowly, delivers a twist I neither expected nor wanted, and fails to deliver the charm we've come to expect from films such as Toy Story, The Incredibles, Cars, etc. It's a prime example of a one-and-doner â€“ once you've seen it, there really isn't much to warrant an encore viewing.And one warning to parents â€“ there are quite a few moments that will be too scary and intense for the wee ones. If there is a chance that storms, witches, darkness, and bears trying to maul children could frighten your child then you might want to think twice before taking them to see this. At least a couple of kids started crying at the screening I attended, and one other asked her mom to let her leave the theater.Anyway, I know good and well that reviewing a Pixar film is about as pointless as carving Jell-O with a Ginsu knife. I could tell you it was the movie equivalent of a shirtless Michael Moore and you'd still go see it. So be it. Thus are the limitations of my influence.",6,7,15,22 June 2012
Saw II," This is exactly how low budget should be done!
","Note to all the 50+ year old critics who are still single and spend most of their time in arthouses praising the subtext of Oscar-contending foreign films: this movie isn't intended for you. You might want to keep that in mind the next time you insist on reviewing it just so you can lambaste the gullibility of its target audience.That being said, I'm going to make this real simple for you readers. Are you actually part of Saw II's target audience? Did you enjoy the original? If so, then I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy this sequel. If not, then direct your time and money elsewhere. It's not a complicated process.Let me make it even clearer: the opening scene involves a man with a trapjaw device hooked up to his face. He has a very short amount of time to get the key to unlock it before the device snaps shut and uses his skull as a pin cushion. The real kick to all this? The key is buried in his face, below his eye. But hey, he has a knife he can use to dig it out! I'm sure there's no need for me to point out that it's not a pretty scene. This is either your flavor of frappuccino or not.Being a sequel, Saw II has no choice but to be looked upon with a skeptical eye. Sequels always start with that handicap. I enjoyed Saw (especially considering its LOW budget and less-than-stellar cast), so when a sequel was announced about 12.3 seconds after Saw made a profit on opening night, I had my doubts. The question had to be asked, is there a story to be told or just money to be made? There's no doubt that there's money to be made here, but thankfully the story doesn't suffer just for the sake of making a healthy profit against yet another small budget ($4 million). The main element of Saw II's story that really gripped me is its intense unpredictability. A lot of that is due to the fact that you likely won't recognize most of the cast. That's fine with me. If you stick the 5'4' Tom Cruise in that room then there's no doubt that he's going to figure out all the puzzles and save the day. However, put such no-names as Lyriq Bent and Tim Burd in there and you know everybody's fair game! The premise isn't much different than its predecessor - Jigsaw is one messed up individual who is dying of cancer, and he's putting people in nasty situations to find out what lengths they'd go to in order to survive. But what I like about the new group of victims is that they all have something in common. To make things a little more complicated, they also have a connection to Donnie Wahlberg. Are they disgruntled New Kids on the Block fans who still feel they're owed refunds? You'll have to watch to find out.So is this sequel better than the original? It's hard to say. There are definitely areas that have been improved - the acting, for example. I'm not going to claim that the acting is across-the-boards fantastic, but overall it is better than the original. Nobody attempts the over-the-top act that Cary Elwes tap danced upon us. I particularly liked the interaction between Jigsaw (whom we see a LOT more of) and Donnie Wahlberg. Both guys put in fine performances.But the main advantage that the original still owns over the sequel is its ending. I felt Saw's climax was possibly the most exciting, most intense 10-15 minutes of any movie of 2004. Saw II doesn't end on quite the same pace, but it still goes out with a pretty loud bang. The suspense, tension, and painful-to-watch gore moves along at a consistent clip, and by the time it all wraps up we're delivered a couple of clever twists and really cool tie-ins to the original. Just keep in mind that this ain't no riblet that needs a clean picking and you should be fine.Just be forewarned that like needles on a chalkboard, there are some scenes that will make you tense up and feel the pain. All I'll say is when you see a big group of hypodermic needles appear on screen then go ahead and start preparing yourself. Get in your best squint-mode and be ready to squirm.",7,0,0,22 November 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Worth at least one look
","First off, let me just point out the following: 1. I have never read the book. 2. I have never watched Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory in its entirety.If you're finished picking your bottom lip up off the ground then we can continue. Why does everybody act so shocked when I reveal I have never watched the original Willy Wonka from start to finish? People act like I've deliberately sinned in the literal presence of God when I tell them this, as if I've back-handed Him and boasted, 'There's more where that came from, old man.' Come on, people, don't look so shocked. The movie wasn't THAT big of a hit ($4 million at the box office). Granted, it's a popular kid's movie, but still. The good news is that I can offer you a completely unbiased opinion.I have to admit that I wasn't exactly peeing my pants to see this movie. And if I *had* been peeing my pants just to see a movie then it would've probably been in my best interest to seek medical help. But the trailer gave me no desire to see it. The main problem in my mind was Willy Wonka just looked too goofy. The fact that he made me think of Michael Jackson didn't help. Despite the ruling of twelve jurors, I still wouldn't trust the guy to own a chocolate factory and invite kids to it. So admittedly, I went into the movie with the expectations of Tom Cruise at an amusement park with height restrictions - hope for the best but expect the worst.'All right, Johnny, if you're done being cute can you please tell us if the movie far exceeded your expectations?' Well, it's a'ight, but I'd say 'far exceeded' is a bit much. Visually the movie looks great, the storytelling is smooth and presents an interesting morality tale, Freddie Highmore is quite good as Charlie Bucket (the only non-annoying kid in the movie), and the chocolate world looks realistic enough that I was seriously craving candy while watching it.But on the flip side, the movie ran a little slow in parts, Willy Wonka had a tendency to be too weird for what seemed like the sake of just being weird, and I didn't care for the Oompa Loompas. After being told that the Oompa Loompas were creepy, I was quite disappointed. They're about as scary as being attacked by a bat-wielding midget in a gunfight. I know that probably doesn't make much sense to you, and I'm sure that may sound freaky, but if you've ever been in the situation then you'd really know. Oh you'd know.It's a mildly entertaining flick, but I really have no need to see it again. It neither captivated me nor enraged me to such a degree that I feel compelled to convince you one way or another on whether you should see it.I will point out that Stephanie and my cousin Nicholas are both fans of the original, and they both agree that it's better than this remake. Stephanie's main complaint was that all of the Oompa Loompa songs are different and nowhere near as good as the originals. They definitely tried to jazz things up a bit, but I found it annoying that some of the lyrics are hard to understand. When you're singing lyrics about why each of the kids is bad then that's part of the storytelling, and I shouldn't be forced to strain my ears to hear.But what I really want to know is why people think Johnny Depp running into glass and falling down is so funny? It happens twice and the audience howled with laughter each time while I sat there stone-faced. I can only imagine how hard everybody would've laughed if Willy Wonka had farted and fell down at the same time.THE GIST: Go with your instinct. Are you dying to see it? Well, if you're actually dying to see this movie then you should probably go see a doctor. No movie should bring near death upon anybody. But once you find some treatment then it's probably worth it to you to check out. I know the people at the screening I attended loved it. So be it. But if the trailer does nothing to intrigue you, and if you didn't even like the original, then save your money. This is one of those movies I'd personally wait to make a rental or catch on TV.",6,1,4,21 July 2005
Black Snake Moan," Everything is indeed hotter down South
","I'll be honest with you; this is not the type of movie that I'm usually drawn to. All you have to do is watch the trailer and read the plot summary to figure out where you stand. But just to continue this honest streak, I have to admit that Jackson and Ricci are so good in their roles, that they were able to pull me into the story and keep a grip on my interest.Combining a sweltering Southern setting, blood and guts blues riffs, and a little unexpected Bible imagery, Brewer has definitely given this film a style of its own and an atmosphere that's as effective as the actors in telling this strange little tale of love and redemption.Though its aspirations run higher, there's no denying that the film has its moments of exploitation. Ricci's half-nakedness for 75% of the film is testament to that. Those of you with more delicate palates might experience a little discomfort watching this, and understandably so. It's raw. It's ugly. It's dirty. Even Brewer agrees that this isn't exactly for everybody.And that's what makes this such an odd movie to pin down. On one hand, I don't think I'd ever have a need to see it again. But on the other, I'm kind of curious how my opinion might be affected via a second viewing. Did I really like it? Or did I merely appreciate the effort and success in Brewer's ability to tell his unusual story in his own unconventional way? It's definitely a film that inspires discussion ... and a wide variety of adjectives. Strange. Over-the-top. Interesting. Unique. Uncomfortable. Take your pick. All these things combine to make it the theatrical experience that it unashamedly is.It feels like a gritty, twisted blues song come alive on screen. It's a character study, and if you have any hope of enjoying it then you must accept the fact that the film doesn't shy away from showcasing the underbelly of a very disturbed young woman and the path she's traveling.No, it's not for everybody. But love it or hate it, I feel safe in saying you likely won't see anything else like it this year. Proceed at your own caution. Just remember, everything is indeed hotter down South.THE GISTBlack Snake Moan is the type of film that makes you stop and examine your audience before deciding who to recommend it to. It features very solid acting, a great atmosphere, and a strangely different story. But it also gets a bit sick and twisted at times and has no problems doing so. Take my words to heart and then go with your instinct on this one.",6,186,238,2 March 2007
The Greatest Game Ever Played," For lovers of golf and/or underdog sports dramas
","Let me go ahead and clear this up - no, The Greatest Game Ever Played is not about the time I led my softball team to victory by knocking in the winning run with a triple. Instead, it's about golf. More specifically, it's based on the book that's based on the true story of Frances Ouimet.The story is so simple that even a Tennessee Vols fan can follow it - boy loves golf, boy becomes caddy, boy begins to play golf, dad isn't happy because he thinks it's a waste of time, boy miraculously overcomes insanely enormous odds, movie gives audience a bunch of warm and fuzzy feelings, the end. I'll leave it to you to guess the outcome and whether the boy's father eventually accepts his son following his dream.This is one of those movies that will absolutely thrill its target audience. If you love golf or Disney-produced underdog movies then you'll enjoy this one. For me, it's one of those movies that's good for one viewing. I enjoyed it, but it was a little slow-paced at times, and since I already knew the outcome of the match I wasn't completely enthralled with the tension that Bill Paxton tries to derive by following a golf ball on its arduous journey to the hole. However, others in the audience would clap wildly at every long putt that was sunk.I have to point out that I didn't find the fat little 10-year-old caddy as cute as most everybody else in the audience. He had some funny moments, but his little one-liners grated my nerves: 'easy peasey, lemon squeezey;' 'okey dokey, pipe n' smokey;' 'read it, roll it, and hole it.' Sure, the audience guffawed with overdone laughter, but it just seemed to me that this was an attempt to create some new catchphrases for people all over the world to start using on golf courses. I pray that doesn't happen. Allow me to introduce my own catchphrase to whoever thought these annoying lines were cute enough to put into the movie: shovey wovey up your butty.Hey, I never said I'm all that mature.",6,12,25,30 September 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," You'll love it or hate it. I thought it was great.
","Have you ever had a relationship that went bad, and you wish you could just forget everything about it? Ever had a person in your life that was nothing but a constant source of irritation?What would you do if you had the opportunity to erase all memory of an individual? Is it worth coping with the bad in order to hang onto the good? Or would it be better to have no recollection at all? These questions are at the root of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.'This is a movie that people will either love or hate.  I can understand why a lot of people won't really care for the movie. If you're expecting 'Bruce Almighty' or 'Dumb and Dumber,' then you're going to be sorely disappointed. The movie definitely has some funny moments, but it's not a classic Jim Carrey comedy. Just so you'll know where I'm coming from, let me point out that I love Jim Carrey's crazy antics in movies such as 'Ace Ventura,' 'Dumb and Dumber,' etc. But I also like to keep an open mind when he tries something different.Would I ever want to go to the trouble of having some of my memories erased? Nah. Good or bad, my memories constitute who I was, which directly led to who I now am. You start messing with that stuff, and there's no guarantee on what could happen. It's not worth the risk.  Man, I'm such a philosopher!THE GIST:If you're looking for something original and unique, then 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' definitely matches the description. But keep in mind that this is a movie that requires your brain to participate. If you can engage yourself in the movie and take the effort to think about what's going on, then you should enjoy it. But if all you want is a rubber-faced Jim Carrey running around shouting 'Well all righty then,' then you might find yourself disappointed.",Null,0,1,16 June 2004
Saw," The piecing together of a brutal puzzle ensues.
","How far would you go to save your own life? Go ahead; ask yourself that question right now. Exactly how far would you go? Would you kill someone if your life were on the line? Would you cut through someone's stomach to get something you needed to save yourself? Would you watch an entire night of UPN programming with no interruptions? Would you make out with Rosie O'Donnell? The extent a person would go to save his life, an indication of how much he actually wants to live, is the underlying theme of Saw.The movie follows the sick and twisted exploits of a killer only known as 'Jigsaw.' But in reality, he hasn't killed anybody. He's much more sadistic than that. He places people in very dire circumstances and then tells them what they need to do in order to survive. It's all part of his game. You break the rules, then you'll pay the consequences.Simply put, Saw is one of the most entertaining, original thrillers of the year. You might want to introduce yourself to the edge of your seat before the movie starts because chances are the two of you will be getting acquainted real quick. In fact, it might not hurt to bring it flowers. My interest was piqued at the very start, and just when I was scared I had figured everything out (and was getting disappointed because I thought things were going to be too predictable), the movie slapped me right upside my face and taught me a little lesson in not thinking too far ahead.Now if you're the nitpickiest of nitpickers, then you can find enough nits to pick if you have nothing better to do. The movie's got its flaws; I won't deny that. Plot contrivances? Check. Plot holes? Sure. The acting? Well, it's a tad suspect at times, mainly in regard to Cary Elwes. Rumor has it that a landing strip was placed on 'the top,' and he just flew right over it. Elwes kicked subtlety in the crotch, and then beat it while it was down. He's all right when he is more constrained, but at times it feels like he is auditioning for a high school production of Hamlet. I haven't seen so many crocodile tears since Bill Clinton attended Ron Brown's funeral. Oh well, just be prepared to laugh at him and you'll be fine. Other than that, the acting is decent even though most of the characters like to scream a lot.Personally, I can ignore the film's flaws because I was mainly concerned with where the movie was headed and if it could pull everything together effectively. I'm happy to report that the climax is possibly the most exciting, most intense 10-15 minutes of any movie I've seen this year. Off the top of my head I count six unexpected twists in that short amount of time. To put it bluntly, the ending knocked my socks off, ran 'em through the rinse cycle, chewed 'em up into little pieces, spit 'em in my face, and made me thank it for the privilege. It was quite the spectacle.I guess I better warn you that if you're looking for a pot of gold and a rainbow at the end of these proceedings, then you'll be disappointed. But I liked the ending. It fit with the dark tone and dreary atmosphere of the rest of the movie. This isn't a love-fest about every child in the world getting a puppy. It's a movie about a demented individual with a really warped view on what constitutes a fun game. I guess Yahtzee just doesn't do it for some people.THE GISTSaw is the perfect thriller to get you in the Halloween spirit. It's not what I'd call overly scary, but it'll keep you in a constant state of unease. The scariest thing about the movie is that there *could* be an individual out there like 'Jigsaw,' but it's probably best if you don't dwell on that.If you don't like gruesome movies that revolve around people in very tense, unenviable positions, then this may not be for you, but it wasn't nearly as gory as I was expecting. For the most part we're shown the beginning of an act of violence or gore, and then we're allowed to form our own mental images. It's really nothing I haven't seen on a very special 'Viewer Discretion is Advised' episode of CSI. So if you think you can handle it then check it out and enjoy the thrill ride.

National Treasure," Some movies are meant to entertain, not intellectually enlighten
","If you're planning on seeing National Treasure then please do me a favor right now. Get a pen and paper. What? Yes, a pencil is fine. Ready? All right, now write 'plausibility' on the paper. Done? Good. Now go find a window and open it. I'll wait. Got it? Cool, now throw that piece of paper out the window. Done? Excellent, now you're ready to enjoy the movie.This is a movie meant to be enjoyed with a big tub of popcorn in your lap, not picked apart and overanalyzed under a microscope. Is it pretty implausible? Of course! It's a movie that focuses on the theft of the Declaration of Independence! What were you expecting, an episode of National Geographic? But what I like is the movie's self-awareness and mockery of its implausibility. One of my favorite scenes is when Ben and Riley are trying to explain to Diane Kruger's character that they think there's an invisible map on the back of the Declaration.The scene works perfectly because Ben gives as little information as possible and is reluctant when Kruger pushes for more info. He knows just how silly she's gonna think this is. It feels as if he's trying to explain himself to skeptical members of the movie audience. On a personal note, I'm still waiting for an explanation regarding Snake Eyes. Come on, Nick, you at least owe me that!National Treasure serves as a reminder of why I used to be a big Nicolas Cage fan. A reminder of why Face/Off, Con Air, and The Rock adorn my DVD shelf. Cage is at his sarcastic and charismatic best. And Bartha does a great job as Cage's sidekick. Not only is he funny, but he also makes himself an honest and believable character by questioning Cage and some of his outlandish theories and ideas. I'm just sad there wasn't a scene where he questioned him about the whole Lisa Marie Presley fiasco. Perhaps the clues can be found in the Jungle Room? *Johnny pats himself on the back for this clever reference to Graceland while readers not familiar with Elvis just shake their heads*This is the mix of humor and action that Joe Moviegoer has come to expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer/Cage collaboration. But don't discount the story. Obviously it doesn't stack up with the likes of Memento, but for a movie that's bound to be labeled a 'dumb action flick' it's actually pretty good, providing just enough mystery and twists to keep my interest. There are also little bits of history trivia dropped here and there (such as the clue that dealt with the history of Daylight Savings Time) that add a nice touch.I've always liked movies that have clues that need to be pieced together, so I enjoyed following along with Cage and Co. as they chased the clues - clues on dollar bills, the clues on the back of the Declaration, etc. In fact, I wish the movie had focused more on the treasure hunt. If some of the chase scenes had to be sacrificed, then so be it. I still enjoyed the chase scenes, but it was the actual sleuthing that pulled me into the story and held my interest.Will it hold everybody's interest? No. My cousin said he fell asleep during the first 20 minutes. He tried to redeem himself and said he really enjoyed the second half of the movie, but everybody around him (who all seemed to enjoy the movie) started to beat on him because of his comments. So yeah, there'll be plenty of people who don't like National Treasure. Big surprise. I can already hear them accusing me of being a studio shill for writing a positive review. Ah well. You'll have to forgive me for enjoying a movie whose main purpose is entertainment, not intellectual enlightenment.Oscar can keep Leaving Las Vegas, and I'll take National Treasure. Congratulations Nick, I now forgive you for Captain Corelli's Mandolin.THE GISTThe formula is pretty simple. Have you enjoyed the previous Bruckheimer/Cage collaborations? If you answer 'yes,' then you'll probably enjoy National Treasure. If you answer 'no,' then either don't go see the movie or don't cry about it afterwards. I know that's asking a lot. But in general, if you're looking for a November movie that has a 'summer movie' feel, and you like Nicolas Cage's brand of sarcastic wit, then National Treasure will entertain.Rating: 3.5 (out of 5)",Null,0,0,19 November 2004
The Descent," Nice spelunk-a-dunks, ladies!
","Smothering. Suffocating. Stomach-churning. All words to describe the feeling of Rosie O'Donnell sitting on your chest (I lost a bet in college once; don't ask). But these words also accurately describe Lionsgate's European horror import The Descent. I wish 'scintillating story' were two other 's' words I could use in my cute little description, but I guess we can't always have it all. Darn you Bogey and McCall! Be aware that this is a film for hardcore horror films. It's gory. Gorier than I expected. If you're not in the mood to see thumbs digging into eye sockets, heads being bashed against rocks, sharp objects going through jugulars, or the cringe-inducing sight of broken bones and gaping wounds then you might want to look for something a little lighter to satisfy your entertainment needs. If you're a self-admitted wuss then you'll probably feel more at home at a James Blount concert. But if you like a slice of horror served raw, gritty, and with nastiness to spare then The Descent will highly entertain.The atmosphere is effectively eerie, the tension is constant and claustrophobic, and the cave setting rarely allows a moment of comfort. Some of the best visuals happen even before we're introduced to the cave-dwelling creatures. I felt uneasy just watching these lovely ladies crawling through tight spots and hanging over cavernous spaces. The creatively subtle use of music only adds to the discomfort and helps make our anticipation of what's going to happen even more unsettling than what we eventually see play out on screen.I also really liked seeing a handful (plus one) of girls flex their toned little muscles and kick some monster rumpage. I don't always need my heroes to be big tough guys with five o'clock shadow to spare and cigars to chomp. Feel free to give me some ladies who are ready to throw down and refuse to cringe and cry in the corner. Of course, I prefer that they be fit and fairly good-looking. I am a male, after all. But the director is to be commended for using the ladies as more than mere window dressing.Granted, I'm not sure how the deformed-looking Gollum creatures could easily kill huge animals and strip them to the bone yet they were easily punked out by some skinny gals, but that's just one of those internal flaws that you have to resign yourself to not obsess over.There are a few of those throughout the film. The biggest flaw being that there isn't much story of which to speak. Read my plot description and you've got about 90% of the story. Though I do highly recommend that you pay careful attention to who's who and what's what at the very beginning. Otherwise, you might be confused as to why certain things happen at the end of the movie.There's still a good chance you'll be confused anyway because for some inexplicable reason the filmmakers decided to go the whole 'let's make the audience scratch their collective head and go huh?' conclusion. Why? It's a disappointment. I wanted a finale that would really knock me over. Saw's final 10 minutes come to mind.I've heard that the European version's ending was more satisfying, so I guess I'll have to wait and see if the DVD gives me the closure I was craving. Something a little less clichÃ©d, perhaps. We know; women scorned have a lot of fury. Apparently Hell is no match for them. But come on, would... no, I won't say any more; I don't want to spoil anything, so I'm stopping here.The Descent won't appeal to all audiences, but it'll definitely please all you horror fans who are sick and tired of crap like When a Stranger Calls that thinks 90 minutes of a phone ringing is satisfactory tension.THE GIST If you like your horror films loaded with atmosphere, tension, and gore then you'll be highly entertained by The Descent. However, if you demand a deep plot and detailed backstories then you just might be disappointed. Your best bet is to go in fully prepared to ignore the film's logical flaws and its sometimes crutch-like usage of cheap (yet effective) 'jump scares.' The faint-of-heart need not apply.",7,3,7,4 August 2006
Inside Man," So far one of 2006's best...
","Show of hands - who here loves heist movies where thieves are doing their very best to pull off the perfect robbery? Well good news - Inside Man is one of the best of the genre to come along in quite some time.What I love most about the movie is the air of mystery that surrounds it and its characters for the entire runtime. Nobody's true motivations are immediately revealed, and it's our job to follow along as everything plays out. And I recommend that as you follow along you pay careful attention to all the characters from the very beginning. You could start to get the hostages and bank robbers confused. But let's get back to our mysterious main characters...You've got Clive Owen - the calm and collected ringleader who has strategically planned this robbery to the smallest detail. He really doesn't seem to be that bad of a guy at heart. He doesn't want to hurt anybody, but he has a job to do and he has to make sure everyone realizes that he's not messing around. He simply must establish that they're not smarter than he is. Who is he and exactly what is his motivation? Then there's Denzel Washington. He's a newly promoted detective whose girlfriend is ready for a ring, but at the moment he has a few hostages in the bank that concern him. But how innocent is he? He's currently surrounded by a corruption scandal involving a missing $140,000 and this could play to his disadvantage regardless of whether he's innocent or not.And what on earth is up with Jodie Foster and her uppity little self? Ever a total wainch (it's a Southern term my friends and I invented, you probably get the gist), she is obviously very skilled in hitting guys where it hurts, and no, I don't mean the pocketbook. She's a mysterious power broker who knows how to keep her 'clients' happy.Her most recent client is Christopher Plummer who just so happens to own the bank that is being robbed. He is really interested in only one thing - the contents of a particular safety deposit box. He wants Jodie to retrieve these contents or make sure they're destroyed. What exactly is he trying to hide? Don't go into the movie looking for a rapid fire action thriller. Inside Man's pace is more deliberate, allowing for gradual character and story development. That's a hard thing to find in a two hour movie these days, but here's an example of how to pull it off. The dialogue is smart and funny, the characters demonstrate believable chemistry, and the script is cleverly written. There may not be any plot twists of Sixth Sense proportions, but it keeps you guessing and manages to serve up a couple of surprises along the way.To say any more would be a risk of revealing too much, so just go enjoy the movie. But you need to be prepared to immerse yourself for a full two hours. If you're even the slightest fan of heist thrillers then check out Inside Man and find out exactly why 'respect is the ultimate currency.'",9,2,3,29 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Great for fans, but will it convert the nonbelievers?
","'Come on Potter, what are your strengths?' When Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody, the eccentric new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, poses this question to young Harry, the young wizard's silence tells the viewer all he needs to know. 'Neither acting nor an ability to display depth or emotion,' would have been the honest answer, but Harry's an uncommunicative type. He's scared and more than a little vulnerable. Fans spanning the universe love this about J.K. Rowling's hero.Given the fact that despite reaching the ripe old age of 14, Harry Potter's onslaught of puberty fails to help him resemble anything other than Rachel Dratch's lesbian sister, it makes sense not to portray Harry as a tough guy who instinctively knows how to take care of business. However, my movie tastes are tailored in such a way that I find it hard to root for the little dork. Give me a hero carved in the Han Solo and Clint Eastwood mold.It may have been easier to accept Potter as a non-traditional hero had he not removed his shirt. Sure, a gaggle of teenage girls in the audience 'ooh-ed,' but the fact that Radcliffe's pasty white chest is sculpted with the musculature of a hummingbird only strengthened my opinion that he's not the type of 'hero' I love to cheer.Now don't get me wrong; I'm not claiming this is a bad movie. It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to accomplish. The Harry Potter series just doesn't do it for me. My friends tell me that if I read the books and watch all the movies in context then I might appreciate everything more, but I don't really buy into that line of thinking. I have neither the time nor the inclination to start reading the books, so I'm more than happy to step aside and let the fans enjoy these movies to the fullest.I will admit that there are moments that I enjoyed. 'Mad-Eye' Moody (whose eye is indeed mad and funny to boot) and his irreverent brand of tough love causes a healthy chuckle when he transfigures a bratty student into a ferret. And the scene where Harry must fight a Hungarian Horntail dragon in an arena carved into the rocky Scottish landscape is a visual treat.However, none of these was enough to keep me from rolling my eyes as we watch Harry and his friends stumble awkwardly into puberty. If you've been dying to watch the ever-annoying and always dumb-founded Ron and Hermione acknowledge a change in their feelings for each other, and if your idea of 'cute' is watching Harry Potter dance badly then you will enjoy this much more than I did. Just try not to be creeped out when Hermione's date to the Yule Ball is the 30-year-old Viktor Krum. What in the world? Another scene I enjoyed was Voldemort's return to human form. The screen oozes atmosphere, but alas, it ends way too soon. It has been 13 years since Voldemort killed Potter's parents and he's been working very hard to regain his power. Couldn't he have had a few more minutes of screen time? However, if he knew he'd return in the form of Michael Jackson then he probably would've opted out. Look at his nose. You'll see what I mean.So what are Potter's strengths? He knows how to please his target audience. He won't win many new converts, but this 4th installment in the series will make an insane amount of money, it will send the majority of its fanbase home smiling, and J.K. Rowling will continue to wipe sweat from her brow with $100 bills (or whatever the British equivalent is) while not losing a single wink of sleep because of Johnny Betts and his little jokes.",6,0,1,23 November 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A little harmless, implausible fun
","'Hey Johnny! So how is Mr. and Mrs. Smith?' Well, what exactly are you expecting from the movie? 'Hmm, I'd say the action of Revenge of the Sith combined with the the clever script of Memento. Oh, and with complete plausibility thrown in for good measure.' Ah, well in that case I would have to say you should probably be flogged with a wet, jello-filled straw. Don't worry, it's not too bad. Trust me. Then you should take my course, 'How to Properly Analyze a Movie Based on its Trailer.' It'll help you look a lot less like a jack-a-dandy and prevent you from complaining about how this movie is just too unbelievable.Too unbelievable? You don't say. Look, right off the bat we're expected to believe that this couple has been married for 5 or 6 years, they're trained assassins who pride themselves on recon, and they never suspected the other of being an assassin. If you can buy that premise going into the movie then you waiver all rights to complain about anything else that's a bit far-fetched, OK? Is this a great movie that I'll gladly add to my DVD collection the day it's released? Nah. But it was good for a couple of hours of non-analytical fun. It's a little slow-paced at times, and there is probably too much emphasis at the beginning on the mundanity of their marriage (they're bored, we get it), but once things start to kick in we get beautiful people, gunplay, car chases, explosions, one-line exchanges, inside jokes, and doses of humor thrown at us left, right, and up the middle. I'd also add 'out the ying-yang' but that'd be too clichÃ©. The fight scene between Brad and Angelina is particularly funny (though probably a little too reflective of a day in the life of Ike Turner), as is Vince Vaughn's small role. You gotta love his defense of living with his mom, 'She cooks, cleans, makes my bed, and I'm the dumb guy?' If you're looking for character development then you better keep on looking. Chances are you won't ever buy into the fact that you're supposed to be watching the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Smith on screen. More likely you'll be thinking as I did, 'Hey, there's Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie just having some fun!' But who cares? As long as it entertains then so be it. It doesn't really take itself seriously, so why should you? I mean, come on, Angelina Jolie walks out of gunfights and explosions looking like she just walked out of a salon, so what are you expecting? It's funny because this prompted my sister Amber to comment, 'I wish I could get blown up and still have my hair looking nice.' To which I inquired, 'Why would you want to get blown up in the first place? How about just wishing for your hair to look nice and not worry about being involved in an explosion?' Amber's response? 'I'm just saying, if I were in a gunfight or explosion then I wish I'd walk away looking as fixed up as Angelina Jolie was.' Oh. Well, THAT makes sense. *shakes head* Women.THE GIST There are some pretty cool scenes that I wouldn't mind witnessing again one day, but there are also some clunkers that I'd fast forward through just so I could get to the good stuff. In a Summer full of heavier (albeit entertaining) material, if all you want is to watch a bunch of beautiful people blow stuff up and aid you in a little escapism, then Mr. and Mrs. Smith just might satisfy.3.5 marks (out of 5)",7,0,4,10 June 2005
Glory Road," Works better as a movie than a history lesson
","'We play fundamental, disciplined, defensive basketball.' Don Haskins wasn't interested in flashy, behind-the-back passes. Initially, slam dunks were even banned. Coming from the school of thought that 'showboatin's nothing but insecurity,' Haskins was intent on teaching a group of street-ballers the fine art of fundamentals because he knew that's what it would take to win a championship.Haskins also had no interest in making political statements. He believed in recruiting the best raw talent he could find, regardless of race or background. His main goal was to win basketball games, and he would do that any way he could. He chose to play an all-black starting lineup against the all-white Kentucky Wildcats in the NCAA championship game not so that he could champion a cause but because those were the guys he thought would give the team the best chance of winning. It just so happens that Haskins and Texas Western were able to break down a few color barriers along the way. As one of the original players said, 'We didn't break down all the doors, but we opened some.' The thing that impressed me most regarding Glory Road is the authentic look and feel of the movie, particularly the championship game. Filmed with a gritty, sepia look, the viewer gets the sense that he's watching genuine footage from the '60s. The cinematography executes a great balance between colorful and drab, effectively capturing the environment of the time and location.Production design is just as authentic, using replicas of signs and banners that were at the actual game. Those with a real eye for detail will note that even the concession cups carry the Coca-Cola design of 1966. And of course, a basketball movie set in 1966 wouldn't be complete without the super tight short shorts. Youngsters familiar only with the parachute pants that players wear these days might be in for a culture shock.It's worth noting that the cast and crew were so intent on making the championship game as accurate as possible that they studied choreographed storyboards of each play that would be recreated for the film. Homemade video footage of the game was used to assure legitimacy.Unfortunately, legitimacy isn't a main concern with regard to the rest of the story. Glory Road is fast, dramatic, and often funny, but it plays it loose with the facts. Some purists might be dismayed, but director Gartner admits, 'We took some artistic license as this isn't intended to be a biopic.' Haskins didn't swoop into El Paso, quickly find a group of black players, and then turn them into a championship team in one year, as the movie would have you believe. He slowly built the team. He became the head coach of Texas Western in 1961 and made it to the championship in 1966. Also, the movie is peppered with racial tension among teammates and hotel ransackings that never happened. Can you say 'added for dramatic effect'? But I suggest that you not dwell too much on the factual inconsistencies. The bottom line is that Glory Road is not only entertaining, but it also gets across an important point. No, Haskins wasn't trumpeting a cause, but his desire to win at any cost went a long way in changing the national perception of black athletes and helped kick start the desegregation of college sports.If you agree with Haskins' 'Decent don't cut it with me' mantra then check out Glory Road. It's not just decent; it's a really good mixture of fact and fiction that tells one of the most important, and least known, stories in sports history.Make sure you stay through the closing credits.",7,25,41,13 January 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," A compelling collision of fiction and reality ensues.
","If you're looking for a 'Will Ferrell comedy' where he runs around acting stupid, screaming at the top of his lungs, and basically annoying the (Fergie's Music) out of me then you need to keep on lookin'. What I'm about to say will soon become a clichÃ©, but this is a different role for Ferrell, and I happen to think that's a good thing.Is 'subduedness' a word? If so then that's what Ferrell brings to Harold Crick. *pulls out the dictionary* Cool, it is a real word! Just a slightly awkward one. Fine, we'll say Ferrell underplays this just enough to make Harold the sweet, innocent hero that he is required to be for us to cheer for him to find that alternate ending. Better?Harold seems like a tough guy not to like. Until you find out he's a tax man. Plus, he's a little obsessive. He counts the strokes when he's brushing his teeth. He knows the exact number of steps he must take to reach the bus every morning. He takes a 45.7-minute lunch break and a 4.3-minute coffee break. Everything is a routine, and he relies on his wristwatch to keep him on track.Contrast that with the woman he's sent to audit - the tax-evadin', anarchy-lovin' bakery owner Ana Pascal (played by the extremely personable Maggie Gyllenhaal). It's a match made seemingly, well, not in Heaven, so when they start to have feelings for each other you really don't expect to buy it. But you know what? It works! The romance is simple and subtle, and surprisingly believable.But the meat of the story, the ol' sauce on the steak as grandpa used to say, revolves around Harold's efforts to figure out from whence the voice in his head is coming. Whereas I'm about to initiate some efforts to find out why I just used 'from whence.' Harold really needs to figure out what to do once he hears her talk about his death. Is his life a comedy or a tragedy? Can he change his fate, or should he resign himself to accepting what appears to be inevitable? I can hear you now (you crazy voice in my head!) - how do you take a story about a real-life man who slowly learns his life is some weird product of fiction and make it work? How do you deliver a satisfying ending to such a perplexing structure? Well, I had the same questions. I didn't know if it'd pull it off, but it does, and all I can say, without giving too much away, is the proof is in the viewing.A viewing experience that is unique in how it takes so many elements of different genres and figures out how to make them work together. There are laughs, there's drama, there's fantasy, and as I mentioned earlier, there's a little romance as well. In fact...*puts down man card* Ferrell gives Gyllenhaal a gift that inspired the most amount of 'awwwwws' from the audience that I've heard at a movie this year. I have to admit, it really is a sweet moment.*picks up man card* I liked the structure of the story, and Emma Thompson's narration is handled in such a way that it adds a little mystery and keeps you guessing how the story will wrap. I was even impressed with some of the visuals in the film, specifically the manifestations of the numerical analyses in Harold's mind.The first 2/3rds of the movie set everything up so well that I was really scared of a disappointing payoff. I wasn't necessarily rooting for a 'happy' ending; I simply wanted a satisfying one. If it were true that Harold must die for the book to be Emma's masterpiece, then sell me on it. However, if Emma could figure out an alternate ending, then sell me on that.As always, I won't reveal what happens. I recommend you watch it and find out on your own. So I'll just sum up my final opinion this way - sold.THE GIST You might be disappointed if you want another over-the-top Will Ferrell comedy. However, those of you in the mood for a less annoying side of Ferrell, a mix of drama and comedy, and something a little different and inspiring should consider giving Stranger than Fiction a chance.",8,0,2,10 November 2006
Hitch," Formulaic but funny, and Eva Mendes is smokin' hot!
","Call me a romantic comedy loving sap if you want to, but I enjoyed Hitch. There, I said it. I enjoyed yet ANOTHER romantic comedy. I guess I'm just a sucker for hot babes and some good laughs. It's a powerful combination that helps me overlook a movie's shortcomings, of which Hitch has a few: it gets too sappy at the end, it's predictable, it's formulaic. You've pretty much seen it all before:* Unlikely couple meets. * Unlikely couple dances around a relationship. * Unlikely couple finally gets together. * Unlikely couple experiences a major misunderstanding that splits them up. * Unlikely couple finally realizes the misunderstanding and reconciles.Not once did I find myself teetering on the edge of my seat, wringing my hands in despair because I was fearful of a disastrous outcome. But who cares? What I did find myself doing was laughing out loud quite a bit, while also trying to conceal the drool that would escape on the right side of my mouth whenever Eva Mendes would appear on screen. Woo baby!There are several things that helped me brush aside the familiarity and just enjoy the movie. You've got Eva who is hot and has a great personality. And Amber Valletta is pretty cute herself. Then there's Will Smith who is both charming and funny. He exhibits good chemistry with both Mendes and Kevin James, who is pretty funny in his own right. Come on, fat guy dancing! That's always good for a few laughs. Some people might find the over-the-top dancing a bit silly, but I'm one of those guys who can always find humor in watching white people try to dance like black people but doing a horrible job of it.I laughed pretty consistently throughout the movie until they cued the sappy 'You are the wind beneath my wings'-esquire dialogue near the end. I sincerely suggest that you pop the top on the Maalox or Pepto Bismal, take a good couple of swigs as Will Smith begins his extremely gay speech about love, falling, flying, taking leaps, blah blah blah, and your stomach should settle enough to let you enjoy a little more silly dancing at the end. Eva Mendes. Tight dress. Dancing. Thumbs up.Sure, things got a little too gay at times, but I appreciated the handful of moments where the movie poked fun at what initially looks like a sappy scene. I loved the bit with Eva watching Jerry Maguire and crying during the 'You complete me' scene, which is one of the most gag-inducing lines of all time. Yeah, and you just completed my digestion cycle, Tom, because my food's coming back up. That's one line that simply can't be made fun of enough.My recommendation is that you grab your sweetie, accept that you're not gonna see any new ground being broken, make sure you have your yellow bucket handy for Will's big speech at the end, and enjoy a funny, cutesy, fairly safe romantic comedy for Valentine's.THE GISTHitch has enough laughs for the guys (and well, enough Eva for the guys) and enough romance for the ladies, for me to recommend it to those of you looking for a cute romantic comedy to help you celebrate Valentine's. There are a few moments that will gag you with sugary sweetness, but strong performances by Will Smith, Eva Mendes, and Kevin James help you overlook it.

Casino Royale," Daniel Craig IS Bond. End of discussion.
","If you've listened closely then you've heard the whining and complaining from the Bond purists regarding the selection of Daniel Craig as the next Bond. 'But he's blonde!' 'He's not handsome enough!' 'He's not enough of a lady's man!' Y'all need me to call you a wah-mbulance? Get over it, crybabies. Daniel Craig IS Bond. That's right; I said it.To be fair, I'll point out that I have no real allegiance to the Bond franchise. I'm too young to remember much about Sean Connery's forays, and I mostly rolled my eyes at the cheesiness of Brosnan's attempts. I don't despise Pierce as Bond, but come on, remember his ridiculously fake CGI surfing? He was one step away from punching out a shark.But Daniel Craig? Now here's someone I can buy as an agent of the British Secret Intelligence Service. He's a tough, no-nonsense guy who kills without blinking and doesn't let it bother him, because, as he points out, he wouldn't be very good at his job if he did.If you want somebody who looks like he just stepped out of a hair salon then maybe he's not your ideal, but give me a guy who actually looks like he's been in a fight or two. If I saw Craig walking down the street? I'd think twice before messing with him. If I saw Pierce Brosnan? I'd be more inclined to ask what hair conditioner he uses.Like last year's Batman Begins, Casino Royale has reinvented a franchise. This is a darker, edgier Bond. 007 with a couple of extra shots of adrenaline. Sure, the action scenes require a small suspension of disbelief, but they deliver, and it's nice to be able to see where the budget went. Other high-dollar blockbusters should take note (COUGH Superman Returns COUGH).You know what else I liked about the movie? 'Eva Green's rear end?'Well, yeah, but that's not what I was talking about.'Daniel Craig's rear end?' What? No! Why would you even say that? Get out of here. Sheesh. I also liked that Bond was required to do most everything on his own. He had to use his mind, strength, and combat skills to get the job done. There isn't an abundance of fancy little gadgets and invisible cars. I like the basis in reality.'Well Johnny, in your wise and omnipotent opinion, what would you say were the movie's weak points?' Good question, observational reader. The movie runs a little long at almost 2 1/2 hours. I felt things started to drag during the third act when they spent a large amount of time focusing on the romance between Bond and Vesper. We're talking long stretches of Bond on the beach and in bed, telling Vesper his desire to give up his profession for her. Yeah, yeah, we get it - now give us some action! A better integration of the action and slower scenes would have helped the pace move more briskly, so a runtime trim wouldn't have hurt my feelings. No big deal though. From a pure entertainment perspective, this doesn't disappoint.If the 'purists' are still out there whining and complaining then ignore them. Daniel Craig has done something that Pierce Brosnan never accomplished - he's made me look forward to the next installment in the series. I think we've found a new, legitimate action hero. Thanks, Mr. Craig, you've shown me that Bond can rise above sexual escapades and cheesy one-liners. Bravo! Hey Pierce? Enjoy making Mrs. Doubtfire 2. Your services are no longer required. You may go now.",8,2,5,17 November 2006
The Ringer," Go ahead, laugh with a clear conscience
","'Son, there are two types of people in this world - those who think quotes like 'I can count to potato' are funny, and those who don't.' OK, so maybe those weren't the exact words of wisdom my grandfather once shared with me, but the meaning is the same. Some people just don't laugh at stupidity, and if you fall in this group then 'The Ringer' probably isn't your wisest choice of investment this Christmas season.That's not to say that 'The Ringer' is nothing more than a stupid comedy. There are a handful of genuine laugh-out-loud moments, and surprisingly, there's a whole lot of sentiment. Unfortunately, and I hate to say this, but that's ultimately what drags it down.Think about it. Johnny Knoxville rigs the Special Olympics in order to make some money. The Farrelly Brothers are producers. The screenplay is written by Ricky Blitt, one of the writers on 'Family Guy.' Should be knock-down, drag-out, envelope-pushing political incorrectness that dares to offend anybody who is brave enough to buy a ticket and watch it, right? Wrong. In fact, the movie goes out of its way to make sure the audience knows Johnny Knoxville is a good guy.You see, he needs the money to help a guy have surgery who he couldn't bear to fire at work in the first place. And of course, he's reluctant to go along with his uncle's plan. And you know he's going to become best friends with all of the other Special Olympians. Knoxville spends so much of his time performing knightly actions that the movie essentially becomes a 90-minute infomercial for the real Special Olympics.That is certainly something I don't want to knock because it does make the film likable. Many moviegoers will have their hearts warmed over the relationships Knoxville develops with the Special Olympians (even though the majority are portrayed by real actors with no real disabilities). Knoxville's soft heart leads to something that I thought was kind of weird - the movie is designed for you to actually root for him to win, despite the fact that he's a fraud.The reason is reigning champion, Jimmy, is a jerk who you'll feel no sympathy for. Like my grandfather used to say, 'Just because you're handicapped doesn't give you the right to be a jerk.' He offered this nugget of wisdom once when a guy in a handicap parking spot flipped us off because we were walking too slowly behind his car.So as an after school special this works well. But as a comedy? Well, it just wasn't as funny as I wanted it to be. Oh, I laughed, and I smiled, and I drooled over Katherine Heigl, but I never had to catch my breath or tend to a busted gut, nor did I ever miss dialogue because of overwhelming audience laughter.So is it worth your hard-earned money? I honestly can't see a necessity to pay to see it on the big screen. Besides, it won't make a ton of money at the box office, so it'll be on DVD soon. Wait and make it a rental. It's not the comedy it should have been, but it has good intentions. And like granddad always said, 'You can't always be the best at everything you do, but you can always be likable. It's not as easy for people to be hard on you when they see that your heart's in the right place.'",6,4,6,3 January 2006
Fantastic Four," It's not horrible, but it's far from fantastic
","Fantastic Four's stench is nowhere near as rancid as that of Catwoman, Elektra, or Daredevil, but it's really not all that fresh, and I don't know if back-handed compliments like that are really what the movie was shooting for. But hey, looking at the reviews it's getting I think it should take what it can get.The movie is actually a little more entertaining than I thought it would be, but my expectations were lower than a Star Trek fan's on prom night, so that's not saying a lot. Yes, it provides a few laughs, and it didn't send me into the stupor that Daredevil did, but there just isn't anything at all about the movie that stands out. I can't pinpoint a specific thing about it that impressed me.Shouldn't I be impressed on at least a small level? Am I supposed to be bowled over by Jessica Alba turning invisible? Yeah, Claude Rains did it in an equally convincing fashion in 1933. Oh, I know, how about The Thing? He's a big rock dude who should be able to do massive amounts of damage! Weeeeell, unfortunately his foam rubber costume looks ridiculous. I know Chiklis fought hard against using CGI because he wanted to bring the human element to the character, but he apparently forgot about the 'laugh out loud at how ridiculously fake the costume looks' element. Chiklis does a pretty good job, but come on. The main problem with the character is that he spends most his time either lamenting his condition or being cute. Yeah, you're a big rock, wah, get over it and DO SOMETHING! And could someone please tell me who thought Ioan Gruffudd would make a good Richard Reed? This guy is supposed to be the leader of the group? I guess he was close to being a convincing leader. All he lacked was charisma, intensity, toughness, charm, emotion, and courage. Other than that... It also didn't help that most the scenes where he was using his stretching ability looked like they came straight out of Looney Tunes.At least they had a really cool bad guy, right? Surely you can't go wrong with Dr. Doom! Apparently you can if Dr. Doom is in the hands of the guy who directed Taxi. Dr. Doom spends the entire movie looking like an older Kerr Smith from Dawson's Creek, and then we get about 10 minutes of him in the mask? Wow, thanks. And after the transformation he really isn't all the menacing or threatening. He sounds like he's talking in a subway tunnel. Plus, his anger is understandable.The guy has his entire business and livelihood stripped away from him, so naturally he's gonna be pretty ticked off. Then the Fantastic Four get all the praise and glory for their new super powers? Bitter? Yeah, I think he might be. He loses everything while they all become heroes. Let's face it, somebody with the name of Victor Von Doom is destined to be a bad guy, there's really no way around that, so it would've been nice if he'd actually had an edge to him. Where's the darkness? I'm more scared of Christian Bale as Batman, and he's a good guy! Doom comes off as a bad guy for 6-year-olds to not be too scared of.Another nitpick complaint is since this is supposed to be an origin movie, why aren't we given an explanation as to why each person got the specific super powers he or she did? It's barely hinted at that the powers reflect the personalities of each person, but why exactly does Jessica Alba gain the power of invisibility? Are they trying to claim she has transparent acting ability? Speaking of which, she sure looks good in her Fantastic Four outfit, but where is the emotion? Where is the conviction? I know she wasn't given much to work with, but put a little power in your line delivery! This certainly didn't help fuel the romantic angle between her and Dr. Reed. Whew, that didn't pan out, now did it? I saw more spark in my 10-year-old brother's eye when he watched Dakota Fanning in Uptown Girls than I did between these two. You'd think two scientists would know at least a little something about chemistry. *rim shot* Thank you, thank you.I do have to give Chris Evans some credit though. He actually seemed to be having fun with the role, and his character actually has a personality. While the others were whining and moaning about their new, cool super powers, he was genuinely excited about it. That's how I'd be. I'd just shrug my shoulders, ask myself how much fame and money I could make off my little DNA alteration, and run with it.But let's be honest, we all have to admit that the words, 'Wow, Chris Evans really carried the movie,' don't speak well for the movie as a whole.As a superhero movie, this just isn't that good, folks. The best way for me to describe Fantastic Four is that it felt like a pilot for a TV show. As a 'Chris Evans at the Apollo' showcase it works, but as a comic book translation? Nah. It comes off as more of a 'sitcomic book translation.' BA DA BING! Man, I'm just full of 'em today.Let me leave you with a public service announcement: if you're a Fantastic Four fanboy, and you end up really enjoying this movie, then I'm truly happy for you. But please, under no circumstances ever refer to this as 'funtastic.' You deserve to be punched if you do.",5,10,20,21 July 2005
Click," Not exactly what you're expecting, but does it work?
","If you want to enjoy this movie then you must first willingly undergo a major suspension of disbelief.'Why, because of the supernatural aspects of Sandler's ability to control his life like it was a DVD or TiVo?' No, because it's completely unbelievable that any man would want to fast forward through massaging Kate Beckinsale or having 'marital relations' with her. Movie or not. I made this comment as we were filing out of the theater, and Mr. Shade acted like it was a plausible idea, replying, 'Well, maybe if you had to do it over 100 times.' Balderdash. IT'S KATE BECKINSALE! I'm willing to step up to the plate and test this theory (with Stephanie's permission, of course). We'll call it the 'Kate Beckinsale Massage Challenge.' After massage #101 I'll let you know if Sandler's desire to fast forward through it is anywhere near believable. I'm willing to do this for all you readers out there. All for the sake of improved believability in our movies. Drop me a line, Kate. This is all in the name of science; I promise.'That's great, Johnny. You'll never hear from her, delusional boy, so how about the movie?' Oh, right, the movie. Thanks for reminding me. I guess I should point out that I'm an Adam Sandler fan. A fan who has learned to forgive him for Little Nicky and a fan who thinks Punch-Drunk Love is mystifyingly overrated, but a fan nonetheless. That being said, I enjoyed the movie. I was entertained. Is it great? No. Is it in the upper echelon of his work? Nope. Could Kate Beckinsale just stand there motionless on screen for 90 minutes and send me home with a smile on my face? Oh yeah.There are moments when the crudeness is overdone (seriously, how many times can you show a dog humping a stuffed animal before you realize it stopped being funny about 40 minutes ago?) and apparently I'm one of the few people left in the world who doesn't think little kids cussing is adorable (yeah, I'm sure you'd giggle if it were YOUR child dropping 's' bombs), but the film still managed to coerce a good number of out-loud laughs from me.I'm not gonna sit here and wax poetic about what I would do if I came across a remote that could control my life. That'd be a waste of my time and yours. However, I found it interesting to watch Sandler as he made his decisions in regard to this little technical wonder. I especially liked the menu and its special features - including a commentary track with James Earl Jones. Funny stuff.Sandler movies, by their very nature, are quite easy to review. Do you hate the guy? Then skip it. If you love the majority of his work then you'll have a good time. However, I feel it's my duty to warn you that Click is a little different than what you might expect.In an effort to show it ain't just a one-trick pony (and probably to appeal to a broader audience), Click takes a strange dramatic turn about 2/3rds of the way through, and it stays pretty serious for a good 20 minutes or so. Fan base be warned. The teenagers in the crowd started to get restless as they were obviously desperate for Sandler to hurry up and say something like, 'Gippity bop simmidy doo.' References to It's a Wonderful Life are accurate, though I feel it taps more into A Christmas Carol complete with Christopher Walken as the Ghost of Really Bad Hairdos. Some of the dramatic aspects are handled well, albeit with little originality, but things got a little too solemn for my taste, especially since I was in the mood for something purely comedic. Much like the majority of people who give speeches at wedding receptions, it tries just a little too hard to wrestle out the tears. Sandler's attempt at crying is particularly unconvincing.I'm sure there's a section of you who will ignore the predictability of it all and appreciate the fact that Sandler is trying to show a little maturity these days, and that's fine. I'm just pointing out that the transition in tone is awkward, and the drama overstays its welcome. Take some lessons from Liar Liar on how to add dramatic elements and life-changing revelations while remaining consistently funny.The bottom line, America, is Click will have quite the mixed reaction, even among Sandler's staunchest fanboys. Can you handle the dramatic shift? Will you buy into it? Can you tolerate the sometimes juvenile and sophomoric humor on display? I've equipped you with the necessary knowledge; it's now up to you to make your choice.Oh, and did I mention that Kate Beckinsale isn't too harsh on the eyes? Can't remember if I did or not so I wanted to make sure I pointed that out.THE GIST If you can't stand Adam Sandler then I have no idea why you'd wonder if you should see Click or not. If you're a fan of the Sand Man then chances are you'll be entertained, but reactions to the dramatic tone shift will be very mixed. Don't expect Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore.",6,6,16,23 June 2006
Coach Carter," Samuel L. Jackson's depiction of the true story of Coach Ken Carter ensues.
","Immediately after being introduced as the new head coach, Coach Carter informs the players that respect and discipline will be required. Naturally, this doesn't sit well with some of the guys. After all, they were used to getting away with everything. But that's the attitude that resulted in only four wins the previous season. So instead of accepting disrespect, Carter forces a player to leave the gym. Two of his slacker friends follow him.When one of the remaining players speaks up and complains that they just lost their two highest scorers from last season, Carter replies, 'Well then will have two new highest scorers this season.' That's Coach Carter. He took the reigns of a team of underachievers and pushed them to be better than average. But to be more than average, you have to accept the responsibility of a certain amount of work and effort. Don't want to accept your responsibilities? That's nothing that 1000 push-ups and 500 suicides won't cure.There's no doubt that some people just don't have it in them to play for a coach like that. I've been there, and a lot of the time you absolutely hate the coach. 'Come on, coach, what do you mean we have to run stairs for 10 minutes?? We just had a 2 1/2 hour wrestling practice!' We ended up running stairs for 20 minutes, and that was the last time any of us complained. We hated the coach at that moment, but he got our attention, and more importantly, he got his point across.Achieving excellence is never easy, whether it be in the sports arena or in the classroom. Coach Carter's team was doing great on the basketball court, starting off the season on a huge win streak. But problems in the classroom brought everything to a halt. Bye bye sunshine.Once Carter received progress reports from the teachers (he had to twist arms to do it), the bad news was several of his players were failing classes. They all signed contracts to maintain a 2.3 GPA. They didn't maintain the GPA. So what happened? Carter locked the gym, closed practice, and said all games would be forfeited until the conditions of the contracts were met.Great! It's about time a coach took a stand like that! I guess parents, school board members, and the community all rallied around the coach and his brave stand, right? Nope. Parents and the rest of the community were only concerned with trying to win a state championship. In fact, the parents were in such an uproar that they demanded that Coach Carter be fired.The school board cowardly voted to end the lockout, and Coach Carter said that he would quit. But the team rallied around him, and said they wouldn't play until everybody met his requirements.Samuel L. Jackson is, no surprise, perfect as Coach Carter. You wanna scare a couple of players straight? Just have Samuel L. stare 'em straight in the eyes for about 5 minutes. Jackson is so convincing as a disciplinarian that I stood up at one point during the movie and started running suicides. The taunts of, 'Look at that idiot running in the theater' and 'Sit down! Your stupid pants are ruffling and making too much noise' didn't bother me. I knew Coach Carter would be proud.By no means is this movie a masterpiece. The main drawback is that I wasn't enthralled with all the little subplots. The one side story with the player being involved with dealing drugs worked well because it made sense within the context of the movie. But I could've done without Ashanti and her basketball-playing boyfriend talking and whining and talking about her unplanned pregnancy. OK, fine, yeah, that stuff happens all the time in the ghetto, but that doesn't mean it makes for compelling viewing. I'd rather see 10 more minutes of Jackson threatening to break somebody's face than 10 minutes of a school dance.As a result of the subplots, some people might get a little restless with the 136 minute running time. I'll probably watch this again one day on DVD, but when I do I'll fast forward through all the scenes dealing with Ashanti and her pregnancy. Yeah, yeah, human interest, blah blah blah. Unfortunately, it was of no interest to THIS human, so there you go.Also, the 'I came to teach boys, and you became men' inspirational clichÃ©s start to hit hyper drive as the movie winds down. You'll probably roll your eyes at least twice, and you might want to keep a plastic yellow bucket handy in case your gag reflex kicks in. But hey, it's forgivable.This is a true story (with some poetic license exercised) that needs to be heard. Basketball is a privilege. Many amateur athletes think they can play professional sports, but Coach Carter knew differently. That's why he still believed in the STUDENT-athlete. In his own words, 'On the streets and public basketball courts in Richmond and any other city in America, you see the broken dreams of former high school legends who got left behind by life. And I was just not going to let that happen to these boys.' Now if you'll excuse me, I've got 50 more push-ups and 10 suicides to do.Rating: 4 (out of 5)",Null,4,13,14 January 2005
Shark Tale," Well, that was lametastic.
","Well. That was quite unimpressive. To be honest, I didn't really expect much from the movie, but I certainly expected more than this, especially when you look at the talent they had to work with. The movie *looks* pretty good, and it's technically sound, but it's just boring. Seriously, I nodded off at least twice. After a while I was just ready to head to my truck because, unlike with the movie, I knew I'd actually be headed somewhere of interest.I guess I just don't find all the hip-hop music and hip-hop jokes as entertaining as some might. Maybe I'm just jaded since I've seen those jokes used in about 32 different movies. They lose their shine after a while. I'd like to chalk it all up to the humor being directed at kids more than adults, but there were a lot of kids at the screening I attended, and they didn't seem to be laughing that much. How many 10-year-olds are gonna laugh at MC Hammer references? I mean really. When did they start production on this, 1990?You're in luck if you love bad puns though. For names we've got: Jessica Shrimpson, Cod Stewart, and Mussel Crowe. Then you've got some punny product placement such as, The Gup, Coral Cola, Kelpy Kreme, and Old Wavy. Then there are the expected pop-culture puns like, shell phones, scallop polls, and raise the reef. There are plenty others, so keep your eyes and ears open. If you can. Otherwise, just bring a pillow if your kid forces you to go.The most clever thing about the movie is how most of the characters have physical similarities to the actors voicing them - De Niro's shark has a mole, Martin Scorsese's blowfish has huge eyebrows, Jolie's fish has big lips, and Will Smith's Oscar actually looks like Will Smith. However, portraying Christina Aguilera as a hooker fish seemed a tad inappropriate.There are some funny jokes scattered throughout, but mostly this movie only managed to elicit polite chuckles from me. I can't remember a single guffaw-inducing moment. It's not a horrible movie, but it just didn't do anything for me. The pace gets surprisingly slow at times, and the attempts at a little relationship drama aren't the best ways to keep the kids' interest.Oh, and I had a bit of a scare at one point in the movie. I thought the theater ceiling was falling on me, but it turns out the movie was just beating me over the head with its 'accept people for who they are' and 'being loved is more important than being famous' messages. Yeah, yeah, pass out pamphlets if you're so desperate to get that message across. That way I can just throw it away on my way out of the theater and not worry about it.THE GISTI usually enjoy CGI-animation, but Shark Tale isn't in the same league as Toy Story, Shrek, or Finding Nemo. If you're looking for outdated jokes and an uninspired storyline, then this will be right up your alley. As far as entertainment value goes, it's about on par with Garfield, except it doesn't have the benefit of Jennifer Love Hewitt in a cute skirt.",Null,1,2,15 October 2004
Cinderella Man," Truly one of the best underdog stories of all time
","You want my review of Cinderella Man? Here you go: Best. Boxing. Movie. Ever. Period. And yes, I'm aware of the existence of Rocky. As entertaining as Stallone's little slugfest is, Cinderella Man is just better on all fronts - better acting, better drama, and more realistic boxing. I've boxed before, and I can say with a straight face that this is the most realistic boxing I've ever seen in a movie. Plus, and this is the best part, it's a true story. And quite an amazing one at that. Why don't we have cool sports stories like this anymore?Nowadays all we have to cheer for are overpaid athletes who are willing to sacrifice an entire season of their sport if they don't get a few million more bucks to line their pockets. But James J. Braddock? He fought for something more. He fought to put milk on the table, to put a little more distance between his children and the street, to have a better way of life.You want drama? Cinderella Man effectively shows us the impact of the Great Depression on the average family. This was a time when unemployment hit a record high of 15,000,000 people. Once Braddock is unable to box, he is left hoping and praying for a one-day pay at the docks. When he can't pay the milk bill, his wife has to dilute what little they have with water to stretch it as far as they can.Then when Braddock doesn't have the money to pay his power bill during the snowy winter, his wife sends the children to live with her sister, breaking a promise Braddock made to his son. Desperate to get his children back, Braddock is forced to get government assistance and to beg everybody he knows for $20 so he can pay his bills and get his children back.Braddock's family is struggling, so you can feel how huge it is when he's offered the chance to make $250 as a last-minute fill-in against the 2nd-ranked contender. You want excitement? Well, this is when the boxing side of the story really kicks in. Braddock gets a very surprising knockout, he gets his boxing license back, and he starts training to compete in some elimination fights for the championship.Everything builds up to the championship match against the feared Max Baer, a man who is so brutal that he has killed two men in the ring. And he's not nice about it either. He mocks Braddock, talks about taking care of his wife after killing him in the ring, and reminds James that 'people die in fairy tales all the time.'Once the championship fight starts - whew. Not to sound too corny, but it really does feel like you're at the fight. When the crowd in the movie starts chanting 'Braddock, Braddock, Braddock,' I wanted to start chanting also. But I didn't because that'd just be too gay. But I was completely pulled into the action.'But Johnny, I'm not a huge fan of boxing! I doubt I'd like a boxing movie.'But it's much more than a 'boxing movie.' Neither Stephanie nor my sister are boxing fans, but they both loved it. I'm not a huge boxing fan either, but if boxing had fighters and stories like this these days then I certainly would be. So yes, in my opinion it's the best boxing movie I've ever seen. But quite simply it's just a great movie with a great story that happens to be told within the confines of the boxing world.This is as upbeat and inspirational as Million Dollar Baby is depressing. After watching Cinderella Man you'll leave the theater feeling good about life and being inspired to try to accomplish something yourself. For a brief second you might toy with the idea of getting your fat, chubby little legs off the couch and doing something with life other than watching movies and playing video games all the time. It may be a fleeting fancy, but the spark will be there.My 20-year-old cousin walked out of the theater claiming, 'I want to be a boxer now.' Mr. Shade and I both want to start kickboxing again. And everybody was doing an Internet search afterwards to find out where we could read or watch more about the real-life James J. Braddock. And you know what? I'm even man enough to admit to the following conversation after the movie:Johnny: So, did you cry? Amber: I got teary-eyed when he was telling his children bye. Steph: Me too.*Stephanie and Amber stare at me for a few seconds*Steph: Well? Johnny: What? Amber: Come on... Johnny: All right, fine. My eyes started to perspire just a little. You happy?Hey, don't look at me like that, guys. I have feelings just like everybody else. Like Brian's Song, this is one of those movies where you can get a few goosebumps, get a little misty with 'eye sweat,' and still keep your man card afterwards.",10,1,2,3 June 2005
Dodgeball," Intentionally over-the-top, but it works.
","Over-the-top. Outrageous. Silly. Ridiculous. All words that describe the mullet one of my friends sported back in high school. And yes, I have a picture to prove it, and no, I'm not scared to use it. But conveniently, these words also form a fitting description of 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.'THE GIST Don't expect *anything* serious from 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.' It's completely over-the-top, it's completely insane, it absolutely knows it, and it positively revels in it. This will work for some people, but others will find it stupid. And I admit, some of it is stupid. Folks, this is a movie with 'Dodgeball' in the title, so would you like to guess what part of the male anatomy is used quite often as a punch line? How willing you are to invest your time in the insanity of the proceedings will likely determine how much enjoyment you'll get from the movie. I'm a fan of insanity, so it worked for me.",Null,0,0,17 June 2004
The Island," This one is fairly smart for the genre, so please quit acting like it's xXx: State of the Union.
","All right, I might as well go ahead and prepare to take some heat from all you Bay haters (Michael Bay, that is) out there. You ready? *ahem* *stretches neck* ... I liked The Island! There. I said it. And let me make it easy for you...'Hey Johnny, how much is the studio payin' you?' 'What up, shill? Must be nice being a studio plant.' Cut and paste the one you like the best into an email and send it along. I haven't started a Cafe Press page selling 'Michael Bay - World's Greatest Director' t-shirts or anything, but come on, the man knows how to deliver the action goods. The Rock is only one of the best action films of the 90s. Nicholas Cage was rockin' the Casbah in those days, and you know it. Even though I don't think there are Casbahs in North America.Anyway, The Island is destined to be one of those movies that pleases most moviegoers, yet irritates the elitist critics. You've heard their complaints before: It's too loud! There are too many car chases! Bay's so in love with explosions that he might as well propose to them! This is just pretty people involved in action sequences! There are too many plot holes! I'm not sure why so many critics were willing to ignore some of those same issues with War of the Worlds but are so outspoken about them in regard to The Island. Still hopin' for that Spielberg interview I guess. But you know what? I like explosions! I like really cool car chase scenes! And doggone it; I thoroughly enjoyed watching Ms. Johansson run away from trouble in those tight little white jumpsuit pants of hers. Granted, the outfits are goofy. I'm pretty sure my entire family (with the exception of me) had some almost like that during the late 90s when swishy jumpsuits were all the rage. But Scarlett wears it well.The story behind The Island might not be overly original (yes, it combines elements of Logan's Run, THX 1138, Blade Runner, The Clonus Horror, etc.), but it's fairly interesting nonetheless. And it's not a subject that is too far-fetched. You've got a company that, through a $120 billion investment, has started to clone humans. People who can afford it can have themselves cloned in case they need an organ transplant in the future. After all, it's the American dream to live forever (how else do you explain Joan Rivers' 24 face lifts?), so there are plenty of investors willing to try to expand their lifespan by 60-70 years. Have you seen what people do these days in the name of preserving their beauty? I have no doubt there are people today with enough money (and little ethical concerns regarding cloning) who'd be up for this.However, the investors are told that the clones will be kept in a vegetative state, so when it's discovered that the organs fail without life or consciousness the hijinks begin. Sean Bean, in what has to be his 47th role as a bad guy, runs the facility and views the clones as nothing more than tools and instruments. The trick is the clones view themselves as humans. We all know that heads will eventually butt and shenanigans can't help but ensue.The Island is a movie that has a thought-tickling message it wants to touch on, but its main goal is to give moviegoers a lot of cool things going boom in a somewhat believable and futuristic fashion. It definitely succeeds on that level, and for that reason I was able to ignore the plot holes and minor squabbles. What's harder to ignore is the blatant product placement.Sheeeeeesh, got a few sponsors to make happy? I guess one thing Bay can't be accused of is being subtle. Prepare to be bombarded with close-ups of Xbox, MSN Search, Aquafina, Nokia, Ben & Jerry's, etc. Much like DJ Qualls' nose, it does stick out quite obviously, but if you can ignore it or laugh it off then you'll be just fine.",8,0,0,4 August 2005
