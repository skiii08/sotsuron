Conquest 1453," Pure propaganda, extremely poor executed and totally unbelievable
","This movie is about one of the greatest events in history. With incredibly high voting numbers. That is getting attention, but is the movie worth it? Firstly the movie complete fails to make a substantial underline of the importance and greatness of Constantinople. The animations where nice, but a total FAIL compared with 'Agora' or 'Lord of the rings'. More over the movie doesn't really show the Byzantine struggle en effort to get Latin help and still doesn't get a real help a the end. It would have be nice to see the might Emperor of Byzantium head to Italy en totally impress everybody. However the don't. For the feeling is also doesn't help that Byzantines, Italians en the church all speak Turkish.The Ottomans (somehow called the Turks in the movie) where depicted in accurate historical setting and outfit. Expect of course the army didn't all wear the same.... Oddly they didn't do the same for the Byzantine army, people and even the buildings....Regarding the plot, I never heard of a call of Mohammed to conquer Istanbul. So it is an outrage, considering the political contact, that such a claim comes in this movie. Even the siege it self contains major errors which I will not discuss because of danger of a spoiler. However, it is unbelievable that two major commanders of the Turks and the Byzantines look like twin brothers in almost no armor and end up in a matrix like sword fighting. The final ending is also so a-historical. I can sum up more major errors, but that would be a waste of time. It is so bad that we can come to a conclusion: this movie is pure propaganda, centuries late. But even as propaganda it is extremely poor executed and totally unbelievable. 1/10",1,7,17,29 September 2012
