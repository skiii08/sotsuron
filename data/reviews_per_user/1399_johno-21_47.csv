Saturday Night Fever," Vinnie Barbarino is Buddy Love
","This is a coming of age film with a 23 year old actor playing a 19 year old in the lead role of tony, a 19 year paint store clerk who is obsessed with spending his Saturday nights on the dance floor of a Brooklyn discotheque. He can shake up a can of paint and he can shake it up on the dance floor but has little else going on. He does have a 19 year old girl, Annette, played by a 23 year old actress over at the disco who is obsessed with him but he is attracted to a 20 year old woman, Stephanie, played by a 32 year old actress who he wants as his dance partner in a competition. The actors who play Tony's presumably same-age buddies from the Italian neighborhood are 25 and 27 years old and the third one is actually 19 years old. The story is based on a story by Nik Cohn that appeared in the June 7, 1976 New York Magazine that was passed off as a true story called Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night. Cohn had gone to the 2001 Odyssey disco in Brooklyn to look for material for a story on the disco scene. He saw an impeccably dressed and coiffed dancer who stood out among the crowd and came back the next week to look for him but he wan't there and he couldn't learn anything about him. He knew nothing about the disco scene so he ditched his plan and decided to make up a story using the guy he had seen as the model for his character he called Vincent. Producer Robert Stigwood read this story and figured it would be a good movie and he could score the music to it from The Bee Gees who were under his contract. Norman Wexler who had written the screenplays for Serpico and Joe adapted the short story into a screenplay. Rocky director John G. Avildsen was hired to direct but his differences in how the Tony character should be written with Stigwood's vision got him fired and replaced by John Badham who had recent success with The Bingo Long Travelling All-Stars & Motor Kings. John Travolta who was well known from the Welcome Back Kotter TV comedy was just starting out in films. He had done two TV movies and had a starring role in one of them and had been in two theatrical release feature films including the popular Carrie. Most of the other actors in this film were unknowns recently starting out in films or making their screen debut. Dance instructor Deney Terrio worked with Travolta and actresses Karen Lynn Gorney and Donna Pescow on the latest disco dance moves and additional training for the cast was from former Broadway actor and choreographer JoJo Smith who had been in the '64 revival of West Side Story and was running JoJo's Dance Factory in New York. Lester Wilson choreographed all the dance sequences. He had choreographed such films as Funny Lady and Sparkle and would go on to do the films Scrooged, Sister Act and the Motown 25 TV special. All their work hardly pays off as this film shows no real love for dancing. The characters are all going through the moves and it's energetic but their is no fun displayed in what they're doing for us to understand why they do it. Cinematographer Ralph D. Bode films the dance sequences in a point and shoot manner with poor lighting and little imagination. The Bee Gees of course provide a bulk of the soundtrack which went on to be the biggest selling movie soundtrack of all time. Lot's of songs by other artists too. Stayin' Alive, Night Fever, More Than A Woman, Disco Inferno, If I Can't Have you, You Should Be Dancing, How Deep is Your love and many more familiar tunes throughout this film. It's amazing that no songs from this film were nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Song which was won that year by the diametrically opposed You Light Up My Life by Debbie Boone. Travolta did get an Oscar nomination but throughout the film I keep imagining him in this role as Vinnie Barbarino doing the Jerry Lewis character Buddy Love from The Nutty Professor. This film hit the disco era in full stride and it was perfect timing. Oddly there had been no disco flavored music films but a flood would follow like Fame, Village People Can't Stop the Music, Roller Boogie, Soup for One, The Apple, The Wiz and Xanadu that all hit as disco was fading. I saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and it is a good snapshot of the 70's disco era but as a story and as a film it falls short. I would give this a 6.5 out of 10.",6,1,4,1 June 2006
Lifeboat," Good drama on the high seas from Hitchcock
","Lifeboat is another fine film from it's director Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcok received the second nomination in his career for Best Director at the Academy Awards for 1944. The film was also nominated for Best Cinematography from Glen Macwilliams and Original Motion Picture Story for John Steinbeck. It's a great character study and is basically a stage play set at sea with a fine cast including Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, Walter Slezak, Hume Cronyn, John Hodiak and Canada Lee. I've always enjoyed this film and have seen it many times. It's a well acted script adapted from a good Steinbeck story by Jo Swerling and Ben Hecht. All Hitchcock films are good and offer something different in each one. This is a little stage restricted and has no performances to absolutely wow you but it's worth checking out if you've never seen it. I would give it an 8.5 out of 10 and recommend it.",8,3,3,12 March 2006
Citizen Kane," All great films are overrated. That's what makes them so great.
","This is a great film and was recognized for that immediately. The National Board of Review named it Best Picture for 1941, the New York Film Critics Circle named it Best Picture for 1941 and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated it for nine Acadeny Awards for 1941 including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, Best Art Direction and Best Music Score. It won it's only Oscar for Best Screenplay for Orson Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz. 26 year old Orson Welles in his feature film debut produces, writes, directs and stars in Citizen Kane, a story of a young boy whose family gives him up to be the son of a wealthy man who will guarantee a privileged life and education for the boy. He grows up to lead a newspaper empire and become the world's most wealthiest man and political pawnbroker. Welles had captivated the nation with his radio play adaptation of another Welles in H.G. Welles War of the worlds in 1938. He took his Mercury Theater Players and made the leap from radio to film and produced an epic film his first time out. He was fortunate to get some smart help to bring his vision to reality. First, with veteran screen writer Mankiewicz helped to write a story for film instead of radio. Second, with veteran Cinematographer Gregg Toland who had photographed such films as Queen Kelly, The Westerner, Kidnapped, Wuthering Heights, Intermeazzo and the Grapes of Wrath among his many films and after Kane would go on to do The Outlaw, The Best Years of Our Lives and The Bishops Wife before he died of a heart attack at the age of 44. Toland had worked with Directors Erich Von Stroheim, Mervyn Le Roy, Howard Hawks, King Vidor John Ford, and William Wyler and brought the skill to put Welles' imagination on the screen. Third, Orson Welles found a young film editor who had edited The Hunchback of Notre Dame and My Favorite Wife named Robert Wise who would go on to be an accomplished director himself with such films as The Day the Earth Stood Still, West Side Story, The sound of Music, The Haunting, The sand Pebbles and The Andromeda Strain. Fourth, Welles was entrusted with and got the best out of RKO veterans Art Director Van Nest Polglase, Set Director Darrell Silvera and costume designer Edward Stevenson to work on what would be the most important film of their careers. Fifth, Welles was fortunate to have a young composer named Bernarad Herrmann score his film. Herrmann would go on to be a favorite of Alfred Hitchcock scoring his films Pycho, The Birds, North by Northwest and Vertigo and would score films and television for directors all the way to Taxi Driver. Next, Orson Welles had fortune with RKO Sound Supervisor John Aalberg overseeing the sound for Citizen Kane and finally Welles was surrounded by a great cast in Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick and Everette Sloane among others. Vision, ambition, inspiration, skill, talent and a little luck came together for Welles who was teamed with a lot of talent that collectively wanted it to come together. It results in a 10 out of 10.",10,1,3,15 March 2006
12 Angry Men," Middle aged angst
","12 jurors decide the fate of an 18 year old accused of murder who faces the chair. As the title implies there is tension and anger aplenty in the jurors room as the all-male cast goes at it including Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, Ed Begley and Jack Klugman. A great cast and great script directed by Sydney Lumet in his first film. Lumet would go on to have a string of hit films in the 60's and 70's including The Pawn Broker, Fail Safe, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon and Network but has been fairly inconsistent since. Lumet certainly knows how to get the best of his cast when he has great actors to work with and 12 Angry Men must have required some strenuous rehearsals. A remarkable screenplay from television writer Reginald Rose who had originally written this for television in 1954. Like the film Marty that had also been a 1953 teleplay that was adapted to the big screen in 1955 by it's writer Paddy Chayefsky, Rose does the film screenplay based on his television teleplay. This was only the second film that Rose wrote a screenplay for and he would only do a handful of movie screenplays in his career which was mostly television work. Polish-born cinematographer Boris Kaufman who was a veteran of Russian, French, Canadian and American films does the photography here. It was nominated for three Academy Awards including including major awards in Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay but amazingly no nominations for any of the ensemble cast. Fonda, did win a Bafta and Jussi Award for Best Actor and was nominated for a Golden Globe and Cobb also got a Golden Globe nomination as supporting actor but the large cast must have canceled each other out when it came to nominations for the Oscars and all the other various industry awards. Passionate, gripping, intense, compelling drama. It's obviously dated with it's all-white, all-male jury and may be a little too heavily centered on the jury room with not much room for anything else but it's great character development and holds up well. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.",9,0,1,13 April 2006
Elizabeth," The Virgin Queen
","A film by a director from India staring an actress from Australia in a story about one of Britain's most well-known monarchs. But hey, it works. This is a lavish costume drama of a semi-historical account of the Ascension to the thrown and the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I. Henry VIII is the second Tudor king and after his death his son the Protestant Edward VI becomes a boy king but dies as a teenager. Edward's cousin, the Catholic Jane Grey becomes the regent queen for nine days and is executed and the Catholic Mary I who is the daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon becomes Queen. Mary in the five years of her reign earns the title of Bloody Mary for executing more people than had been executed in the previous century and a half. Childless, she dies of ovarian cancer and her half sister, the Protestant Elizabeth who is the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, becomes Queen Elizabeth I also known as Gloriana, Good Queen Bess and the Virgin Queen. Elizabeth is also the sixth and last Tudor monarch. This film is filled with castle intrigue, the fight for power, and the religious clash between Protestants and Catholics in a post Henry VIII and post Reformation world. Cate Blanchette who had only appeared in a handful of films won acclaim for her staring role in the film Oscar & Lucinda is cast in the title role of Elizabeth which earned her her first Academy Award nomination. This film has a great ensemble cast. Joseph Fiennes is Robert Dudley the Earl of Leicester and Eliabeth's true love interest. Geoffry Rush is Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's spy master and adviser. Christopher Eccleston is Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, one of the most powerful men in England. Richard Attenborough is Sir William Cecil, Scretary of State and Elizabeth's chief adviser. Fanny Ardant is Mary of Guise the Queen Consort of Scotland who also seeks the throne of England. Vincent Cassel is Duc d'Anjou who is being considered as a possible husband for Elizabeth. Kathy Burke is Queen Mary Tudor who hates her half sister Elizabeth and once had Elizabeth imprisoned in the Tower. John Gielgud, in his final film, has a very brief on screen role as The Pope. The film can be a little confusing as it takes a dramatic license with history and tries to fit too much into a two hour run time. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Original Score, Best Art Direction and Best Makeup winning only the Oscar for makeup. Shekhar Kapur directs a script by Michael Hirst with beautiful cinematography by Remi Adelfarasin. John Myhre and Peter Howitt create stunning sets in art and set decoration and Alexandra Byrne designs elaborate period piece costumes. Jenny Shircore wins the film's only Oscar for makeup but had this not been up against some other particularly strong films for 1998 it would have won more. Director Kapur, cinematographer Adelfarasin and writer Michael Hirst have reunited for the sequel The Golden Age with Blanchette reprising her role as Elizabeth and Rush back as Walsingham. I would give this an 8.0 out of 10 and will look forward to it's sequel in which Sir Walter Raliegh will be a principal character.",8,1,2,28 February 2007
Ed Wood," Fun Flick about the king of campy classic C movies
","How do you make a good movie about a guy who specialized in making bad movies or better yet why would you want to make a movie about Ed Wood? Well, Tim Burton wanted to and he ended up with an Oscar winning film shot in black and white. Based on the book Nightmare of Ectasy by Rudolf Grey it's the cult-like story of the odd and eccentric 1950's movie maker Ed Wood who's forgettable films became unforgettable for how bad and cheaply made they were and were rediscovered by later generations as campy cult classics. Director Burton assembled a fine cast here in Johnny Depp as Wood, Martin Landau in his Academy Award wi8nning role as Bella Lagosi, Sara Jessica Parker, Patrcia Arquette and Bill Murray. Landau in his Best Supporting Actor beat out some fine performances by Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction, Gary Sinese in Forrest Gump, Chazz Palnteri in Bullets over Broadway and Paul Scofield in Quiz Show. The film's other Oscar went for Best Makeup. Stefan Czapsky, who worked with Burton on Edward Sissorhands does a great job of cinematography here and Tom Duffield who also worked with Burton on Scissorhands and Beetlejuice is the Art Director for which he should have been nominated for an Oscar. Another veteran of Burton films Chris Lebezon who worked on Batman Returns is the film's editor. This film has some great humor and is a little slow with not that much of a compelling plot to work with but it is a fascinating watch. I've seen a couple of Ed Wood's movies myself and Buron really did his homework in recreating the world of Ed Wood and great casting too. I would give it an 8.0 out of 10.",8,1,2,1 April 2006
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," The ultimate buddy film
","I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it many times since. It obviously borrowed heavily from the success two years earlier of Bonnie and Clyde where filmmakers took a story about two real life outlaws and fictionally dramatized their story with two good looking actors in the roles of the real bandits. In Bonnie and Clyde they made it a doomed romance and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid they made it two doomed buddies and a beautiful woman for a love interest. Butch in real life was Robert Parker who rode with the outlaw Mike Cassidy and used Cassidy's name as a last name and was a cattle rustler and then a train and bank robber. The Sundance Kid was Harry Longabaugh also known as Kid Curry and the Sundance Kid who was a part of Butch's Hole in the Wall gang of the 1890's and early 1900's. Etta Place is an historical mystery believed to be Ethel Place but since the Sundance Kid's mother's maiden name was Place it's likely she took that name to conceal her true identity. Belived by some to have been the female Colorado cattle rustler Ann Bassett and believed by some to have been a prostitute from Texas few believe the story that she was a schoolteacher who went west for adventure. Paul Newman and Robert Redford star in their first screen pairing along with Katherine Ross and Strother Martin, Cloris Leachman and Ted Cassidy. George Roy Hill had only directed a handful of films before this movie although all were good and he was most noted for Thoroughly Modern Millie. He would direct only eight more before he retired but had continued success with The Sting, Slapshot and The world According to Garp. Novelist and screenwriter William Goldman wrote the story. This film won three Academy Awards for Goldman's screenplay and for Burt Bacharach's music score and song Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head. It was also nominated for Best Director, Best Picture and Best Sound. The only part of this movie I don't like is the video-within-a-movie of the Raindrops song and Butch and Etta's fanciful romantic bicycle ride. I'm most people loved that sequence but it brought the pace of the film to a halt for me. despite that I would still give it a 10.",10,0,2,27 March 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Dark comedy from the Cold War
","When you think of the name Stanley Kubrick it conjures up a larger than life figure that few directors who have directed so few films have. A career of only 13 feature films, four in the 50's four in the 60's, two in the 70's, two in the 80's and only one in the 1990's before his death. It was the 1960's where in a span of four very different films, Sparticus, Lolita, Dr. Strangelove and 2001 he forever established his legendary status. Four films that earned 15 Academy Award nominations including five wins, 10 Golden Globe nominations including two wins, and 13 BAFTA nominations including six wins. In Dr. Strangelove, he sets out to do an adaptation of the 1958 Peter George novel Red Alert but when he teamed with novelist and screenwriter Terry Southern it evolved into a satire. An irreverent, sarcastic, sardonic cold war satire filled with sexual innuendo and symbolism. A great cast with Peter Seller in three roles, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens and James Earl Jones in his film debut. Filmed in black and white by cinematographer Gilbert Taylor who had photographed A Hard Days Night and would go on to do such films as The Omen and Star Wars this film keeps your attention from beginning to end. Anthony Harvey is the film editor here who had worked on Kubrick's film Lolita and went on to be a director himself of such noteworthy films as The Lion in winter and They Might Be Giants. Ken Adam who did seven films in the James Bond series from Dr. No to Moonraker is the production designer. I've seen this film many times and have always been entertained. Interestingly this film and Fail-Safe both were put out in the same year by the same studio. The novel Fail-Safe by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler so closely resembled in premise Peter George's novel Red Alert that George sued Burdick and Wheeler and won an out of court plagiarism settlement. A flaw in this film is George's Red Alert was published in 1958 when the delivery of atomic bombs by B52s was fundamental to conducting nuclear warfare but by the time when Dr. Strangelove was made ICBMs launched from land and submarine was the primary way to conduct mutually assured warfare and B52s would be a 2nd strike facilitator. Look for great stage sets in this film. It's a great film with great pacing and direction and I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.",9,1,2,1 May 2006
MASH," Timeless classic
","M*A*S*H is one of my all-time favorite movies. I so was hooked on this film from when I first saw it in the theater on it's initial theatrical release that I went back to see it several more times and I very seldom will do that with a movie. I've probably seen this in it's entirety at least a dozen times on TV alone and whenever I'm channel surfing and stumble across a showing of it I'll at least stop and watch whatever part of it I've come across for a while. This is a good example of a movie that you have to see more than once. On it's surface it seems like a simple straight forward dark comedy which is obviously using the Korean war setting as an metaphor to the current Vietnam war of it's release. But there is so much going on in this movie you simply can't appreciate it all in a single viewing. It's certainly difficult to pull off a good film that has a large ensemble cast like this one does but M*A*S*H succeeds wonderfully. Sutherland, Gould, Kellerman, Skerritt and Duvall never step on each other but yet each delivers a memorable performance that is an important piece to the greater whole. In smaller roles John Shuck, Bud Cort, Bobby Troup, Joann Pflug and Gary Burgoff are an excellent compliment. The football scene alone with real NFL stars like Ben Davidson, Fred Williamson, Fran Tarkenton and Joe Kapp among others is better than some entire sports themed movies. This is Robert Altman at his best. He alternated between a movie and television directorial career who along the way made some great films including this, Nashville, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, The Player, Come Back to the Five & Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, Images and 3 Women. He also made some less-than-memorable movies so it's hard to figure out the hit and miss genius of Robert Altman but this is a hit and perhaps his masterpiece. Don't go into this movie thinking this is a great war action movie or a great side-splitting silly comedy because it neither. It is a very funny smart comedy and although implausible and surreal it is also very real. I would give this a 10 and highly recommend it.",10,2,7,25 February 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Alice in Francoland
","The story is set in 1944 in Spain after General Franco's forces have taken over the country following the Spanish civil war. Captain Vidal (Sergi López) is a brutal, sadistic commander of a garrison of soldiers that has commandeered an old estate in the mountains of northern Spain that serves as a headquarters to fight rebel guerrillas and as a supply depot for local villagers to get rationed food. Vidal has sent for his pregnant new wife Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to join him against her doctor's advice because Vidal believes he should be present went the child is born and is determined it will be a boy. Carmen had been a widow and has a 12 year old daughter Ofelia (Ivana Baquero). Ofelia is a bookish girl who loves reading and making up fantasy stories. Upon her arrival she discovers a stone and instinct draws her to an ancient stone monument in the forest and she replaces the stone to where it once belonged. This sets the stage of the world of the labyrinth that she will become an integral part of to preserve it's existence. This film is receiving rave reviews from critics and film goers world wide and has been nominated for six Academy Awards in Art Direction, Cinematography, Make Up, Original Score, Original Screenplay and Best Foreign Languge Film. This is the odds-on favorite as best foreign film and could also win an Oscar for art direction and make up. Guillermo de Toro wrote the screenplay from his own story and directs this dark, gloomy blend of fantasy and reality that is also extremely violent. The story is imaginative but fairly weak and full of holes, flaws and inconsistencies. Vidal is so perpetually scary and one dimensionally sinister and sadistic with not even a false or pretentious good side to give the character the element of unknown surprise that would make for superb movie villain. Although Carmen is a central character because of her importance to the story, she is almost incidental. Mercedes (Maribel Verdú) is the housekeeper in charge of the estate staff and has a brother who is one of the rebel guerrillas. Verdú probably provides the best acting in this cast. Álex Angulo is Dr. Ferreiro, Carmen's doctor who is also sympathetic with the rebels in a good supporting role. Doug Jones in makeup and costume plays the dual role of Pan the satyr who dwells in the ancient labyrinth that has three tasks for Ofelia to perform and of the Pale Man, one of the creepiest creatures to haunt a silver screen in some time. Pablo Adan provides the theatrical commanding voice of Pan in one of the great voice-overs of film since James Earl Jones' interpretation of Darth Vader. Del Toro has woven a Tim Burtoneque film here but this would work better as a fantasy film with less violence. I felt the film unraveled at the end and I didn't buy it's ending. I would like to see more from director del Toro but maybe less Brothers Grimm and Lewis Carroll in influence. If you want to do a war film do a war film. If you want to do a fantasy film do a fantasy film. Some images in this film are overstressed as if to say pay attention because this is going to play a key role later on. Okay, okay I get it. Get on with it. Because of gratuitous, disturbing graphic violence I would not recommend this to anyone. I don't see the cinematic achievement that warrants the praise this film is getting. It has a lot going for it but it's not a great film. I would give this 7.5 out of 10.",7,1,5,16 February 2007
The Doors," Dances With Wolves meets Woodstock as told by Oliver Stone
","I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and about a year later I was taking to Doors guitarist Robby Krieger who is credited as a technical adviser on this film. I noted to Krieger that Jim Morrison is often depicted as a dark, brooding doomed poet and I felt that was an unfair one dimensional view of him. I said that I bet Jim Morrison was probably also a very humorous guy and since Krieger knew him I asked if I was right. Krieger said I was and that Jim Morrison was one of the funniest people he had ever known. That's an example of what's wrong with this movie. Director Oliver Stone strips away the fun and humanity of Jim Morrison and makes him a dark psychedelic cartoon character. This film goes nowhere and has nothing to say. Just another example of Oliver Stone's love for revisionist history. The film looks good thanks to one of the best cinematographers of contemporary times Robert Richardson who previously had done Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and Wall Street and would go on to do A Few Good Men, JFK. Natural Born Killers, Kill Bill, Wag the Dog, and the Horse Whisperer. Val Kilmer did an excellent portrayal of Morrison in his looks and speech and mannerisms and must have put a lot of work into his role. Unfortunately for Kilmer he's all dressed up and has nowhere to go. The Indian shaman angle to this film grabbed on to this movie and wouldn't let go. It was overdone, overblown, distracting and confusing. Every time you thought this film was about to go somewhere it would come to a halt and go in some other direction. Kathleen Quinlan, Kyle MacLachlan and Meg Ryan are among a nice cast including Crispin Glover and actor/musicians Paul Williams and Bonnie Bramlett. I would give this a 6.0 because it's not a total loss but I would not recommend it.",6,3,6,12 March 2006
The Best Years of Our Lives," One of the best films of the 1940's
","This is another great film by director William Wyler. It was nominated in eight categories at the Academy Awards and almost swept by winning seven, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Screenplay, Best Film Editing and Best Scoring. They gave a special honorary award for inspiration to servicemen to Harold Russell because they didn't think he would win against Charles Coburn, William Demarest, Claude Raines and Clifton Webb in the Supporting Actor category but he ended up winning that and becoming the only actor to win two Oscars for the same role. This movie can also be remembered as the one that beat out another endearing film, It's A Wonderful Life which was nominated for five awards and won none. A great ensemble cast with Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Dana Andrews, Theresa Wright, Virginia Mayo, Hoagy Carmichael, Harold Russell and Cathy O'Donnell. This movie runs a little long at almost three hours but it's well worth the time. I'm sure I've seen this close to a dozen times on TV and would love to see it on the big screen sometime. I would recommend it and give it a 10.",10,2,3,27 February 2006
Léon: The Professional," Another impressive film from Luc Besson
","I've only seen this once and need to see it again. This is a good film and before I saw it I understood it to be an action-type shoot-em-up film that I probably would have passed on but when I viewed it on television I found it to Be quite well done and an offbeat and interesting and compelling story about the emotionless professional hit-man and his 12 year old neighbor girl who is street savvy and although she has a father and step family she is more like an orphan and a society dropout before becoming a teenager. The hit-man himself is like a big kid at times and delivers his role more through expression and body language than with dialog. The third central character is the dirty cop. French film heavy Jean Reno is Léon, Natalie Portman in her film debut is Mathilda and Gary Oldman is Stansfield star along with Danny Aiello and Peter Appel. Nikta director and writer Luc Besson has a mostly French crew of filmmakers with him here including cinematographer Thierry Arbogast who photographed the Besson films Nakita, The Messenger, Angela, The Fifth element and the soon to be released Arthur and the Minimoys. The great sound to this film is done by a sound team led by veteran Francois Groult. The production designer Dan Weil, worked with the prolific writer/director/producer Besson on several films. I would like to see this on a big screen and see the version that apparently is 24 minutes longer than the version I must have seen. As it is I would give this a 9.0 out of 10.",9,0,1,5 April 2006
Doctor Zhivago," A great film but despite being too long still comes up a little short
","Of all the words often use to describe this film, epic, masterful, unforgettable, sweeping, stunning, seductive, romantic etc..one that I can't apply to it is riveting. It's just a little to long. The love angle between Yuri and Lara never really seems to take off to keep pace with the film. A superstar cast with Omar Sharif, Julie Chrisite, Geraldine Chaplin, Rod Steiger, Alec Guiness, Ralph Richardson and Tom Courtenay, Christie may have been overworked that year. She was nominated for and won Best Actress for the 1965 Academy Award for her role in Darling. She wasn't nominated for Zhivago. The 1965 Academy Awards were basically Doctor Zhivago vs. The Sound of Music with each being nominated for 10 awards and each receiving five. Zhivago won for Best Adapted Screenplay from the Nobel Prize winning novel by Boris Pasternik, Best Color Cinematography for which cinematographer Freddie Young deservedly won, Best Art Direction, Best Original Music Score and Best Costume Design. The art direction, score and costume design awards were a given. Zhivago was nominated for but did not win in Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Sound and Best Editing. David Lean truly made an epic film here but at 197 minutes it is too stretched out. It needed more war, more love or both. This could have been a 10 but I would give it a 9.0.",9,1,2,3 March 2006
The Shining," Campy horror send-up
",I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and I had not read the book to compare it by so I viewed this for what it was a film. Is this an intellectual thriller or a campy send-up of horror movies and the horror genre? Maybe a little of both. An unemployed recovering alcoholic writer has lost his ability to write and is in a marriage with a young son when he accepts the position of a caretaker of a Colorado summer resort. It's big Lodge dating from the 1920's and no roads leading to it are plowed in the winter months for six months of the year. He figures it will be an ideal chance to work on his masterpiece novel and be close with his wife and son at the same time. His son has an ability to tune in to the supernatural. Not a lot of reason for supernatural to be getting all creepy out in the remote Colorado mountains unless of course the old lodge is built on an Indian burial ground and a former caretaker once went mad there and murdered his family. Upon closer inspection it appears that there have been quite a few murders over the years there. Stephen King wrote his novel The Shining while staying at an old Colorado hotel but the hotel used for the films exterior shots is the Timberline in Oregon. The opening scenes were shot in Montana. Interior scenes of the hotel are inspired from various hotels dating back to the 1920's and were constructed on a sound stage. Jack Nicholson stars as the hotel's new caretaker in a character thats kind of a cross between his roles in Five Easy Pieces from 10 years earlier and Little Shop of Horrors from 20 years earlier. Shelly Duvall is the submissive hysterical wife and youngster Danny Lloyd is the son in his first and second to last film role. Scatman Crothers and Barry Nelson are among the cast. The screenplay was written by Stanley Kubrick and Diane Johnson. Stanley Kubrick directs. John Alcott who was Kubrick's cinematographer on A Clockwork Orange and Barry Lydon is the film's cinematographer. Nicely stylized film but the meandering story and it's vague subplots are so peppered with comedy that it never really can concentrate on being a horror film. It's entertaining but the relentless victimization of women and children by the the film's lead character while delivering one-liners is kind of disturbing. I would give it a 6.5 out of 10.,6,0,2,22 May 2006
Apocalypse Now," One of the best films ever made
","This is one of the finest films ever made. Francis Ford Coppala took a huge budget, a huge cast, made a location film outside of the US and took a controversial topic, being the Vietnam War and managed to put all this together and emerge with war film unlike any other. Martin Sheen as the principal character on his mission to his confrontation with the renegade colonel is outstanding. Marlon Brando as that colonel dug deep into somewhere to come across with his memorable performance. Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forest are among the excellent cast. This film has great acting, great character development, a great screenplay, fantastic sound, incredible editing, outstanding cinematography and it's art direction and photography are superb. Just so many elements that go into making a great movie so successfully accomplished here that it's hard to appreciate a single technical element with so much going on and cohesively coming together. The inventive storyline was such a departure to everything that had been shown on TV and in the papers and magazines about coverage of the Vietnam War and it's depiction and reference in other films. The trip up the river begins like a Tarzan movie and evolves into Road Warrior movie and to a Star Trek mission to a western to a psychedelic freak show with a war going on all around it. I've seen this many times but remember when I saw this in the theater when it first came out and people instead of talking among themselves about as they left the theater were just going Wow! This film had eight Academy Award nominations, all deservedly so, but only won two for Sound and Cinematography. I would give this a 10 on a scale of 10 and highly recommend it.",10,1,3,28 February 2006
The White Ribbon," Children of the Korn-Germany's cabbage patch kids
","One of the nominees for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars, this is an art film wonderfully shot by cinematographer Christeian Berger in monochrome cinematography where it is shot in color and then the color is drained away to black and white giving it a washed out, faded look with no sharp, clean contrasts of black and white. Writer/director Michael Haneke takes us back to the northern German village of Eichwald of 1913-1914 just before the first world war. This is a feudal-serfdom type agrarian village that has not yet seemed to have entered the 20th century and where most of the villagers work on the local baron's (Ulrich Tuckur) farms. Told in voice over years later as an old man (Ernst Jacobi) by the teacher of the local school (Christian Friedel) of the chain of strange events that eventually led to his departure from the village. A lot of things happen in this slow paced film. the doctor (Rainer Bock) is injured when his horse runs into a trip wire that someone has maliciously set. The next day, the wife of tenant farmer (Branko Samarovski) is killed in a workplace accident in one of the baron's barns. As it goes on the Baron's son is caned and tied to a tree by unknown assailants, a barn is burned, an infant gets when someone purposely leaves a window open in his room, a pet bird is killed, kids try to drown the baron's son and then steal his flute, a daughter is molested, the strict pastor (Burghart Klaussner) canes his children and ties his eldest son's (Leonard Proxauf) hands to his bed at night so he won't pleasure himself and forces his children to wear a white ribbon to symbolically represent purity when they are caught doing something he deems wrong , a girl has clairvoyant dreams, a midwife (Susanne Lotner) has an affair with the doctor, the 31 year old teacher falls in love with 17 year old Eva Leonie Benesch), the tenant framer's son take revenge on his mother's death on the baron's cabbage patch, a mentally handicapped boy is tortured by other children, a man commits suicide out of disgrace, a girl is molested by her father. And on it goes. It's a multiple who dun it with no real answers and a lot for the audience to comprehend and think about. With Maria-Victoria Dragus as Klara, Fion Mutert as Sigmud, Joseph Bierbichler as the Steward,Steffi Kuhnert as the pastor's wife and Ursina Lardi as the Baroness. Excellet art direction, set decoration, costume design and editing. We never learn who the teacher is telling this story to as he explains the roots of German fascism. the voice over actor is 75 so this must take place in about 1958 as he looks back but we don't know why he is. This is a strange film and I did like it and I would give this an 8 out of 10 but I don't expect it to take home the Oscar.",8,1,5,6 March 2010
Dreamgirls," Reflections
","This is film version of the Broadway musical that ran for almost four years beginning in 1981 and won six Tony Awards in 1982. It's loosely based on Motown founder Berry Gordy and The Supremes but not quite. More like some parallel universe. Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx) is the Berry Gordy-type character who discovers three talented young singers out of Detroit's housing projects called The Dreamettes, Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles), Effie White (Jennifer Hudson) and Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose) and turns them into pop friendly glamor queens The Dreams as his ticket to his own dream to build a record empire and take race record black artists into mainstream and cross-over from R&B to the top 40 pop charts. It's a good ensemble cast with Jennifer Hudson in her Academy Award nominated film debut. James Thunder Early (Eddie Murphy) is a composite character that is part Motown artists Marvin Gaye and David Ruffin with a little James Brown and Otis Redding thrown in. Marty Madison (Danny Glover) is Early's manager. C.C. White (Keith Robinson) is Effie's songwriting brother and is a composite of Holland-Dozier-Holland with a little bit of Smokey Robinson thrown in. Michelle Morris (Sharon Leal) is a Rainbow Records staffer that becomes on of The Dreams. Eddie Murphy is also Academy Award nominated as Best Supporting Actor but it's not much of a stretch and despite him being a soul singer here you just can't seem to get past Eddie Murphy being Eddie Murphy. Jamie Foxx just goes through the motions in his role as the megalomaniac record producer and it makes you wonder why he even accepted the role. Danny Glover is always good but like his character he doesn't have a whole lot to do here. Beyoncé Knowles is one dimensional except for when she's singing. Anika Noni Rose is good and gives a lively performance. Keith Robinson is robotic. Jennifer Hudson is the odds-on favorite to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress but I wouldn't count on it. Her singing voice is so over-the-top and overbearing that after one solo performance it grows pretty tiresome. Bill Condon adapted Tom Eyen's play for the film and also directs. It's well directed as a musical to film but it's a weak script. Virginia Katz does a good job as Editor and veteran cinematographer Tobias Schliessler delivers some beautiful photography. the film has a beautiful look and great sets and production director John Myhre and set decorator Nancy Haigh have been nominated for an Academy Award for Art Direction. The costumes from the early sixties to the disco era are fantastic and a real trip down memory lane and has earned Sharen Davis an Academy Award nomination for Costume Design. The sound mixing has also garnered an Academy Award nomination. One of the problems with this film is the music itself. Despite being a popular Broadway show from 21-26 years ago there are no songs that have become part of the American songbook. Most popular musicals have one or more songs that become cover version classics of recording artists and have instant recall to the audience. Dreamgirls had none. Four additional songs were written for this movie and three of those are among the five songs up for the Oscar for Best Song. One of those will likely win but I don't see any of them being a hit by other artists in years to come. Despite trying to capture Motown the music ends up being average show tunes. Chorographer Fatima Robinson adapted to the screen the work of Michael Bennett from the stage play and also doubles as one of the Stepp Sisters on screen. This film could win two Oscars for art direction and costumes. Hudson will likely get it a third statuette and one of the songs unless they cancel each other out will probably earn it a fourth Award. It's a good film but more visually rewarding than musically rewarding. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.",7,1,2,21 February 2007
The Dirty Dozen," Like a 1960's DC Comics World War II adventure
","I saw first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it many times since. A group of prisoners are led by a renegade Major with disciplinary problems of his own to penetrate enemy lines in preparation for D-Day and disrupt the German chain of command by killing a gathering of top Nazi brass at a château. If the prisoners succeed and survive they will have their sentences commuted. If the Major pulls it off he'll save his career. This is adapted from the 1965 best selling novel by E.M. Nathanson and based on a story told to Nathanson by sexplotation film director Russ Meyer. Meyer was a cameraman in the signal corps during World War II mostly assigned to General Patton. In the real dirty dozen story, they were parachute dropped into occupied France on an assassination mission. They never completed their assignment however. Being typical undependable criminals once they hit the ground they hightailed it for Spain for the rest of the war. The real dirty dozen scenario is much more plausible than this far-fetched tale made into a film by director Robert Aldrich. Proliffic writer/director/producer Nunnally Johnson wrote the screenplay. Aldrich had made some good films in the 50's including Kiss Me Deadly and had a string of good films in the 60's leading up The Dirty Dozen including Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, Hush Hush, Sweet Charlotte and Flight of the Pheonix. He dealt with prisoners again in the Longest Yard and would revisit the violence of the Dozen with Ulzani's Raid. A great cast here with film veterans Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Ralph Meeker and Charles Bronson and actors who would become well known including Donald Sutherland, Telly Savalas, George Kennedy, John Cassavetes in his only Academy Award nominated performance (he lost out to Kennedy who won for his performance in Cool Hand Luke)and Jim Brown, who retired from the NFL while filming this for an acting career. Also in the cast are Richard Jaekel, Robert Webber and Trini Lopez. Nominated for four Academy Awards the MGM Sound Department took home it's only win for Best Sound Effects. It's a good action film with a great cast but it's too much like a comic book action story than an actual war drama story. The entire plot is so implausible and unnecessary that if there is a message in this film about war, double standards, senselessness, hypocrisy etc.. it gets lost in the mayhem. If you remember World War II themed comic books from the 60's like Sgt. Rock, Our Fighting Forces or GI Combat, this movie more resembles them than a typical war picture. There are some good lines and dialog and this is well made film but not my favorite war picture. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.",7,3,3,10 April 2006
Gone with the Wind," David O. Selznick's determination to get this made and made right pays off
","I first saw this during it's theatrical re-release of 1961 at a Drive-In theater. I was seven years old and fell asleep by intermission. I didn't see it again or in it's entirety until the 1976 two night television presentation. I've seen it a couple times since but never again on the big screen and it needs to be seen on a big screen to fully appreciate it. At almost four hours it's still too long for my tastes but when it was made the book was widely popular and people would have been screaming if they cut a lot out of the 1000+ page novel to do a two hour movie. Clark Gable was the immediate choice for Rhett Butler but speculation was rampant as to who would play Scarlett O'Hara. Leading contenders were Norma Shearer, Katherine Hepburn, Carol Lombard and Paulette Goddard. In June of 1938 it was learned that both Gable and Shearer who were under contract to Metro were going to MGM for the project. Also in the cast would be Walter Connolly as Gerald O'Hara, Maurice Murphy as Charlie Hamilton and Margaret Tallichet as Carreen O'Hara. In August of 1938 Shearer announced she was dropping out of the project. Out of 1400 candidates for the role 90 screen tests were made but it wasn't until filming of some scenes were underway that Vivien Leigh wandered on the set and got enough of producer David O. Selznick's attention that she was given a screen test the next day and ultimately the coveted role and eventually the Oscar as Best Actress. The script was in reality never completed until the film was. Playwright Sidney Howard wrote two drafts but unsatisfied with either Selznick brought on Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur who were doing Wuthering Heights to make changes. Also brought on were John Van Druten, Jo Swerling, Edwin Justin Mayer and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Dialog changes were being done as filming was going on with the additions of Oliver H.P. Garrett, Winston Miller, John Balderston and Michael Foster to the screenplay. Ultimately it's collaborated, changed, reworked and reworded screenplay got Sidney Howard the Oscar. George Cukor was the original director but Gable couldn't get along with him so he gave Selznik a list of four directors and said, pick one or I walk, so Selznik chose Victor Flemming and Cukor was out. Flemming had a breakdown while filming and Sam Wood completed the picture with help from William Cameron Menzies and Breeves Eason. Flemming got the Oscar for Best Director. Additional Academy Awards went to Selnick for Best Picture. Ernest Haller and Ray Rennahan for Best Color Cinematography, Hal C. Kern and James E. Newcam of Best Film Editing, Lyle Wheeler for Best Art Direction and Hattie McDaniel for Best Supporting Actress beating out nominated co-star Olivia DeHavilland. McDaniel became not only the first African-American to win an Academy Award she was the first African-American to be invited to attend the Academy Awards. Two special awards from The Academy Awards were presented to production designer William Cameron Menzies and a technically production award to Don Musgrave.Before GWTW was released or had it's premiere, a theater was filled by patrons in Riverside, California who were ready to watch a film they had came to see. It was announced that the film would not be shown and instead they were to see a sneak preview of an upcoming major release and they could have their tickets refunded and leave but once the film began the doors would be locked and they couldn't leave until it was over. When Gone With the Wind came on the screen they shrieked with excitement. 20 million movie tickets were sold for this film during it's initial theatrical run. By it's fourth theatrical release in 1947 100 million tickets had been sold. It's other major theatrical re-releases came in 1954, 1961, 1967 and 1998. More people have bought movie tickets to see this picture than any other film ever released. Among the large cast are also Leslie Howard, Evelyn Keyes, Ann Rutherford, George Reeves and Victor Jory. It's an unlikely love story about a self-absorbed southern belle named Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler who was kicked out of West Point and doesn't actually fight in the Civil War but uses it to his commercial advantage by being a blockade runner but then eventually does become a confederate. It's an adventurous romantic melodrama epic that span 12 years of the Civil War era. Although long and melodramatic, as a film Selnicks determination to have it made and made right paid off. I would give it a 10.",10,1,1,24 April 2006
The Chorus," Great film
",I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 14 films I saw then I ranked this as high as my #2 film of the festival. This truly is an excellent film. Gérard Jugnot's character is a great film role and Jugnot plays him to perfection. there is a style and grace to this movie that helps keep it an enchanting viewing experience for the film-goer. This movie could have ended up dull or had the appearance of a film that tried to hard but director Barratier skillfully took what could have been a small film and made it into a major cinematic feature. I would highly recommend this film and would rate it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.,9,1,2,2 February 2006
JFK," Cinematic art - Historical gibberish
","One of the largest ensemble casts ever with Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman, Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Laurie Metcaff, Sally Kirkland, Ed Asner, Walter Matthau, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Brain Doyle Murray, John Candy, Lolita Davidovich and dozens more star in the 3 hour epic on the Kennedy assassination from director Oliver Stone. Stone is a skillful director and this is a well made film with an excellent editing job from Joe Hutching and Pietro Scalia who had been veterans of other Oliver Stone films including Talk Radio, Born on the 4th of July and Wall Street as they edited down what must have been hours of film shot for this movie blended with actual archive news footage and the performances of the films many actors. Robert Richardson does a masterful job with the cinematography as well. This film is adapted by Stone and screenwriter Zachary Taylor from the books Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs and On the Trail of the Assassins by former New Orlenas D.A. Jim Garrison, calls for a large cast and gives them plenty to do. Garrison was a controversial figure in life and his book was largely hailed as ridiculous. Garrison's book proved he had no credibility as an expert on the Kennedy Assaination. He had a small role in the film as Chief Justice Eral Warren and has since passed away. Jim Marrs has decided to move on to the equally lucrative flying saucer market with his equally absurd book Alien Agenda. Stone likely has toyed with the idea of an Alien conspiracy movie but in the meantime he's working on a World Trade Center film. JFK deservedly won two Oscars for it's cinematography and editing and received another six Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Tommy Lee Jones, Best Sound, Best Music Score and Best Screenplay. It is a well written screenplay but it's too bad that for many film goers the film is viewed as historical fact rather than melodramatic, dramatized, politicized fiction blended with an actual historical event and a subsequent trial involving Garrison. For all the good work that went into this film it results in a wasted effort and opportunity. I would give this it's cinematic merits but for it's content and the direction it takes I can only give this a 6.5 out of 10.",6,7,22,2 April 2006
The Lives of Others," Sonata for a Good Man
","This film is set in the Orlwellian year of 1984 in the old German Democratic Republic of what was known as East Berlin. The Stasi are the 'Shield and the Sword' of the ruling party of this soviet bloc nation, a secret police force of 100,000 that subjugates another 300,000 to spy for them. This totalitarian system is based on a need to know everything about the countries populace of 16 million. Everything is meticulously documented. Big Brother keeps tabs on any it deems worthy of investigation. Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is a button-down bureaucratic establishmentarian who works as a Stasi interrogator and as an instructor in the school for Stasi. His old schoolmate Lt. Col Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) is now his immediate superior. In an attempt to further his career, Grubitz wants to impress Cultural Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) and orders Wiesler to set up an elaborate eavesdropping stakeout to gather information on playwright George Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). Dreyman is a playwright loyal to the party but most his contemporaries have not been including his favorite director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Leinert) who has been blacklisted. Dreyman's live-in girlfriend is the popular stage actress Christina- Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) who is also the object of amorous affection from the sinister, shades of gestapo-like Hemph. This is no ordinary spy thriller. Writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck in his feature film debut gives the screen this wonderfully compelling story of life behind the Iron Curtain in the years leading to the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and continues into 1991 after the reunification of Germany. Wonderful camera work from cinematographer Hagen Bogdanski enhances the stark realism of this film. This is the Academy Award winning Best Foreign Language Film of 2006. I had to see this since it beat out the highly favored Pan's Labyrinth for the Oscar. It's evident to me that Lives of Others is the superior film and the Academy got it right. This film flows so smoothly and your eyes are constantly on every movement on the screen that it's hard to believe you are reading subtitles too. Gabriel Yared's original composition for the film 'Sonata for a Good Man' is a pivotal piece of it's storyline. I can't help but give this film my highest rating of a 10 out of 10 and I would highly recommend it.",10,25,31,9 March 2007
Gran Torino," Magnum Bunker
",I recently saw this during its opening weekend in the Phoenix area. Clint Eastwood directs himself in this urban story of a retired automotive factory worker in Detroit who's wife has recently died and is left alone with his dog in a crumbling former blue collar neighborhood that has been inhabited by Hmong immigrants. An ambitious year for Eastwood as a director with this film coming at the heels of his critically acclaimed 'Changeling' he goes in front of the camera to deliver yet another classic Eastwood character. At age 78 he plays a crusty bigot who is at odds with his grown sons and their families and the modern world in general. Filled with great lines from a story by Dave Johannson and screenplay by Nick Schenk it's got to be the wittiest drama ever. I hope it's not Eastwood's swangsong as an actor and we see more of him on screen. A great film. a classic and I would give it a 9.5 out of 10.,9,4,9,7 January 2009
The Longest Day," An epic film that chronicles an epic day
","I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release when I was a boy which was the only time I have seen it on the big screen. It of course is the story of Decision Day better known as D-Day, June 6, 1944 and the allied invasion of Normany setting in motion a chain of events that would lead to the end of the war in Europe 10 months later. 2,700 ships carrying 176,000 soldiers land on the heavily fortified German controlled beaches of Normandy. Thousands were killed in fighting so brutal that over the bodies 1500 men were blown to bits or swept out to sea and were never recovered. In recent years Steven Spielberg chronicled the event in his film Saving Private Ryan. In that film you are put directly into the battle and it's graphic depiction. That film couldn't have been made in 1962 before Vietnam. This film, The Longest Day is more of the overall telling of the day. German Field Marshall Erwin Rommel was said to have called D-Day, the longest day of the century. From that quote author Cornelius Ryan titled his best selling 1959 book from which this film is adapted from. Told in three parts, The Waiting as they prepare the invasion, The Night as the allies prepare it's launch and the Germans prepare their defense and The Day of the invasion. Ryan drafted the screenplay along with Romain Gary, James Jones, David Pursall and Jack Seddan. It took an equal amount of cinematographers to film it led by Jean Bourgin and Walter Wattiz the all-French photographic team included Pierre Levant, Henri Persin and Guy Tabary which won them the Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography in the last black and white epic filmed. The film won a second Academy Award for special effects. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Art Direction and Best Editing. This film was producer Darryl F. Zannuck's pet project and he claimed to have directed much of it although uncredited in that role he obviously oversaw it's production and it's use of multiple directors to have so many directors turn out a seamless production. Principal directors Ken Annakin and Andrew Marton are supplemented with director Bernard Wicki and second unit directors Gerd Oswald and Elmo Williams in addition to six assistant directors. Shot in 31 locations in France and Corsica including studio locations everything about this movie is on a grand scale. So much so it required four production managers. Among it voluminous international cast of A and B-list stars are John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Richard Burton, Edmund O'Brien, Rod Steiger, Robert Ryan, Mel Ferrer, Sean Connery, Stuart Whitman, Eddie Albert, Robert Walker, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowell, Peter Lawford, George Segal, Sal Mineo, Christian Marquand, Richard Dawson, Curd Jurgens, Jean Louis-Barrault, Werner Hinz, Wolfgang Preiss, Lee Strassberg, Jeffery Hunter, Steve Forrest, Richard Todd, Richard Beymer, Paul Anka, Tommy Sands and Fabian. More isn't necessarily better but in this case it's pretty good. It runs long at three hours and has it's flaws but well worth the time and some memorable screen moments.",9,1,3,16 May 2006
Patton," George C. Scott is Old Blood & Guts
","I saw this during it's initial theatrical release where it looks it's best up on the big screen. I've seen it on television several times since but it's nicely filmed movie that really needs a big screen to do it justice. The story of General George S. Patton during World War II who had been in the military for a long time before WWII. At the beginning of the war he outranked Generals Eisenhower and Bradley and by wars end they had moved up in ranks to both be his superiors. Much of the basis for the screenplay was derived from Ladislas Farago's 1963 book Patton: Ordeal and Triumph and from General Omar Bradley's 1951 book on his WWII war experiences called A Soldiers Story. Additional insight into the mind of Patton came from the 1947 book of Patton's memoirs based on his letters called War As I Knew It. Patton was a very different general from Bradley. Bradley was gentle, courteous, polite and concerned for the welfare of his troops and hated military pomp. Patton was called Old Blood and Guts and reveled in war. He designed his own uniforms and carried a pair of pearl handled colt 45's on his hips and loved projecting a larger-than-life mythic image. George C. Scott was reportedly the 6th actor to be considered for this role after the likes of John Wayne, Robert Mitchum and Lee Marvin but as Patton you can't imagine anyone else in the role. Even seeing old newsreels of Patton himself he seems like an impostor to the film role of Scott. Scott dominated the picture and is in almost every scene for which his role earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor which he turned down. Karl Malden as Gen. Omar Bradley is the only other well-known actor in the film. Bradley served as a technical adviser on the film as did Gen. Paul D. Harris. The film's producer Frank McCarthy was himself a Brig. Gen. during WWII and worked for 20 years to get this film finally produced. It paid off with the Academy Award for Best Picture. Franklin J. Schaffer was reportedly the fifth choice to direct this film. He was known for his recent hit film Planet of the Apes and he would go on to direct Papillon and The Boys From Brazil but had a relatively short directorial career with only 14 films and none before or after Patton that compared to it. He won the Academy Award for Best Director. This is wonderfully photographed by cinematographer Fred J. Koenekamp who had not done a big hit film before. He would go on to film Papillon, The Towering Inferno and Billy Jack and had marginal hits with The Amityville Horror, Uptown Saturday Night and The Other Side of Midnight but would never have a chance to do another big film like Patton. It got him an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography. Edmund H. North who had wrote screenplays for such films as Sink the Bismarck, Destry and The Day the Earth Stood Still and writer/director Francis Ford Coppola on the cusp of super stardom wrote the screenplay for which they received the Academy Award. The film also won Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing and Best Sound. It's other nominations were for Best Effects and Best Music. This film received awards from all the major industry organizations including Writers Guild of America, Directors Guild of America, New York Film Critics, National Society of film Critics, National Board of Review, Motion Picture Sound Editors, American Cinema editors, BAFTA, The Luarel Awards and the Golden Globes. It's a long one at almost three hours but it's an epic war picture and a dramatic character study into the complex personality of a man who was loved by many, hated by many, feared by most and ultimately one of WWII's most respected soldiers. I would give this a 10.",10,1,5,25 May 2006
Kelly's Heroes," Heroes for three days - A great movie forever
","I saw this when it first came out in the theaters and have loved it ever since. Seen it many times on TV. What a great ensemble cast with Clint Eastwood, Donald Sutherland, Telly Savala, Carroll O' Connor, don Rickles, Gavin Macleod and Harry Dean Stanton among others. What's remarkable is that Director Brian G. Hutton and writer Troy Kennedy Martin came together to produce such a fine and funny film but never did much other memorable movie work. Hutton did some less-than-memorable films with some big name actors but most his success was with television. Hutton's only other memorable film was 1968's Where Eagles Dare. Martin too has success in television but not much on the big screen except for 1969's The Italian Job of which this is kind of an Italian Job part II-The War Years. This script has so many funny lines you have to see it twice to absurd it all. The character of the Sherman tank driver Oddball as a Hippy 25 years ahead of his time is brilliant with his positive and negative waves, Speakers on his tank cranking big band swing music, his passion for wine and cheese and catching rays. Eastwood's imposing big screen presence never gets in the way of the cast. Eastwood is of course there but he's less noticeable than in any other of his movies because of all the characters that are his Heroes. Eastwood runs this show with help from Savalas and O'Connor but Sutherland steals it and Rickles keeps it all together. I would give this a 9.5 of a possible 10 and highly recommend it.",9,1,2,28 February 2006
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Dark thriller
","I saw this last month at the 2010 Palm Springs International Film Festival where it played to full theaters. The novel by Stieg Larsson from which this film was adapted is heavily stocked in large American bookstores and I would assume many who went to the screenings had read the novel. I had not read the book but I did talk with several who did and although they liked the novel better and felt it was too difficult to condense the book into a two and half hour movie they did like the on screen adaptation by Nikilaj Arcel and Ramus Heisterberg. Two and a half hours may seem long to some but this film keeps your interest throughout and even though it may seem slow at times I did like its pacing. directed by Niels Arden Oplev this is the story of Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Myqvist) who is a disgraced investigative journalist who is awaiting a prison sentence. He is hired by an aging tycoon Henrik Vander (Sven-Bertil Taube) to do what the police couldn't and solve the disappearance of his niece nearly 40 years before. He is aided by a goth computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) who is a genius at investigations herself. This unlikely combination takes on the unsavory Vander family that is filled with Nazi sympathizers. There are some disturbing violent scenes in this dark thriller that may not be suitable to some. Nyqvist, who seems to be in almost every Swedish movie made is kind of stiff in this role but Rapace is intriguing. Nice production design by Niels Sejer and music score from Jacob Groth. This will play in American art houses and expect an American remake. I would recommend it an give it an 8.0 out of 10.",8,6,12,9 February 2010
The Graduate," A smart and funny 60's flick
","I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and it was a memorable coming of age film for it's time. A young Dustin Hoffman as Benjmin turns in a performance that would catapult him to superstar status as the shy and aimless collage grad suffering from post graduation burnout. He received an Academy Award nomination but did not win. Also nominated was Anne Bancroft as the mean-spirited seductress Mrs. Robinson who also went home without an Oscar. The beautiful Katherine Ross in her role as Benjamin's girlfriend Elaine who becomes betrothed to another and is the daughter of Mrs. Robinson received her only Academy Award nomination in her career. Buck Henry and Calder Willingham wrote the script which also received an nomination. The film also was nominated for Best Picture but the only award it won was for it's Director Mike Nicols. Rounding out this fine cast are William Daniels, Murry Hamilton, Norman Fell, Alice Ghostly and Buck Henry. Shut out from nominations for the great Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack was writer Paul Simon who memorable songs perfectly captured the times and feeling of this film. This was a big film for it's day depicting the generational gap but doesn't hold up as well as many others from it's era or from the year of 1967. I've seen this many times and would recommend it and give it an 8.5 on a scale of 10.",8,0,0,6 March 2006
The Legend of 1900," They should scraped the barnacles off instead of cutting 37 minutes
","I saw this in the theater in 2001 but for it's US theatrical distribution this film was cut from it's original 160 minute run time to 123 minutes. I see here that a lot of people enjoyed this film which I found to be good but not excellent as many viewed it to be. With a film directed by Giuseppe Tornatore of Cinema Paradiso fame and music from the great Ennio Morricone and the interesting storyline I felt this would be a good film to see but I ended up a little disappointed with the film. We never really learn how with no tutelage Novecento becomes the legendary pianist of the ocean. Presumably as some savant skill he was gifted with that listening to pianists play in the ship's ballroom as he grew up he picked it up without training or the ability to read music. The character is pretty dull despite growing up among hardened seafaring men of the boiler room and below deck and being exposed to high society above deck but I suppose one would possibly be kind of one dimensional if they lived on a single ship their entire lives never setting foot on land. Tim Roth is Novecento. Roth looks stiff in the title role. Despite being in a few hit movies like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Rosencrantz and Guilderstern Are Dead and Vincent and Theo earlier in his many films career he seems to have appeared in far more less memorable films including this one. Pruit Taylor Vince has the same career problem. Despite being in JFK, Mississippi Burning, Barfly and Natural Born Killers earlier in his career he also seems to get cast more forgettable ones than memorable ones. both Roth and Vince turn in stiff acting performances here. Clarence Williams III, best known as Linc from the old TV show Mod Squad plays Jelly Roll Morton. Morton was Creole from Louisiana who had mixed race blood but he didn't look black and looked more French so from a historical perspective as this film weaves an actual historical figure into it's fable, Williams is miscast. Williams by the way is pretty stiff himself in this film. The romantic angle in the film never really catches fire and the film has very little drama. This film looks good, has a mildly interesting story and a great soundtrack but despite it 40 years of trans Atlantic crossings it never really goes anywhere. I would give this a 6.0 of a possible 10 but wouldn't see it again.",6,5,10,28 February 2006
Rocky," The little story that could
","I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and I've seen it several times over the years as well as just recently for the first time in along time. It holds up well and is a remarkable film in many ways. It's creation and success is as improbable as it's story. An unknown struggling actor with tough guy looks writes a screenplay about a struggling boxing club fighter who is somehow given a chance to make the most improbable leap imaginable; a shot at the heavyweight championship of the world. Syvester Stallone wrote the story after seeing a fight between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner. Wepner was a club boxer known as 'The Bayonne Bleeder' who worked as a liquor salesman to make a living. In a boxing stunt to give an unknown a chance with a champion, a fight was arranged between he an Ali. The fight was expected to be a brief one with Ali hardly working up a sweat but Wepner went the full 15 round distance and even knocked Ali down once in the fight. In Rocky Stallone plays the title role of a club fighter who works as a collection enforcer for a loan shark to make a living. He's a sensitive guy behind his tough exterior and has a crush on the mousy pet shop sales girl Adrian played by Talia Shire. Burt Young is Paulie, her brother. Burgess Meredeth is Mickey, the owner of the gym where Rocky fights. Carl Weathers is Apollo Creed the Champ who wants to give an unknown from the streets a chance to fight him. Rocky gets selected for the chance and Mickey trains him for the match. Meredeth was the best known of the cast at the time of the film. Shire was known for her recent supporting roles in The Godfather I and II but only for those roles and here is an opportunity to break from the Godfather. Stallone, Young, Weathers and the rest of the cast were relative unknowns. Shot on a small budget and in a 30 day shoot schedule it would make 50 times what it cost to make it during it's initial North American theatrical release and go on to be nominated for an incredible 10 Academy Awards, winning two of the biggest in Best Picture and Best Director and a third for Best Film Editing. John Alvidson who had some critical success with Joe and Save the tiger get an Oscar for his direction. Scott Conrad and Richard Halsey early in their careers get an Oscar for their editing. James Crabbe is the cinematographer. Among the Academy Award nominations Rocky beat out a strong field that included Network, Taxi Driver and All the President's Men for Best Picutre. Stallone in his two nominations for Best Actor and Original Screenplay lost out to film veterans Peter Finch in Network and Paddy Chayefsky's Network screenplay. Young and Meredith may have canceled each other out with two of the five nominations for Best Supporting Actor and Jason Robards won the Oscar for All the President's Men in a strong field of nominees that also included Luarence Olivier and Ned Beatty. Meredith should have won the Oscar for his memorable performance. Shire lost out to Faye Dunaway in Network for Best Actress. This film of course went on to launch a franchise of Rocky films for Stallone but I would have preferred no sequels to this story. Just let it stand as it is as the little story that could. This is a very likable film filled with memorable scenes and duologue and shot on location in Philadelphia with a gritty look. It's worth a look if you've never seen it and worth a revisit if it's been awhile since you've seen it last. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.",9,1,1,25 July 2007
Some Like It Hot," A Billy Wilder classic
","Billy Wilder made some of my favorite films in Double Indemnity, The Lost Weekend, Sunset Boulevard, Stalag 17, The Seven Year Itch and Some Like It Hot. A great presenter of romantic comedies and of drama as well. It was interesting reading how Frank Sinatra, Danny Kaye, Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis and Anthony Perkins and Mitzy Gaynor had been considered for this movie. Who knows what could have happened with Billy Wilder directing but what he got out of Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon was classic. I often wondered why this was filmed in black and white instead of color and the IMDb explained it as Wilder didn't like how Curtis' and Lemmon's makeup appeared on screen in color. I can't buy the explanation given that their makeup looked green on screen. That could have easily been corrected. I think color would have brought more attention to their overall appearance as men dressed as women and made them look less plausible and more like men in drag in the enhancement of color so for overall effect he shot it in black and white. It also fits the 1920's themed story. I've never seen this on the big screen but it was a staple on TV in the 60's and 70's and has been since. I've probably seen this at least a dozen times and have alway enjoyed it. It's been a few years since I've seen it last and I wouldn't mind seeing it again soon. A great cast in support with George Raft, Pat O'Brien, Joe E. Brown who is especially good and Nehemiah Persoff. Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Actor for Jack Lemmon, it won it's only Oscar for Best Costume Design. It's a quick paced, fun film but for me falls a little short and I would give it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.",9,1,2,10 March 2006
It's a Wonderful Life," Over rated because it so darn good
","Once, in the mid 1980's I was visiting someone at a gated community where Frank Capra owned a home and there he was standing by the guard gate talking with the gate keeper. There was Frank Capra, the director responsible for such films as It Happened One Night, Mr. Smith goes to Washington, Meet John Doe, Lost Horizon, You Can't Take it with you, Arsenic and Old Lace, Platinum Blonde and so many others but as I passed by the first film that came to mind was It's a Wonderful Life. Is this film just too indoctrinated in my mind or is it that good of a film? Well, maybe a little of both but it is that good of a film. Is this film over rated? Maybe so but even at it's critical worst it's still a great film. Jimmy Stewart shines as he leads an excellent cast of Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Henry Travers, Ward Bond and Frank Faylen among others. This film was nominated for three of the major Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Jimmy Stewart. It was also nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Well photographed by cinematographer Joseph F. Biroc who would have a long career in film and beautiful art direction from veteran art director Jack Oakey with music from Dimitri Tiomkin this is a well balanced piece of American Cinema. It's amazing that Capra, who would live until 1991 would only direct five more theatrical features after Wonderful Life in his long life. My only fault with this film is of no fault of the film itself but because it has become somehow the benchmark of Christmas movies and gets too much airplay during the holiday season while other great and near great Christmas-themed movies get overlooked. It's a little sentimental but dark enough not to be a Norman Rockwell painting on film and as over rated as it has become I still can't give it less than a 10.",10,2,7,13 March 2006
Psycho," Norman Bates: an unassuming hotelier who wouldn't hurt a fly
","This was the fifth and final film of Alfred Hitchcocks impressive directorial career to earn him an Academy Award nomination for best director. His other nominated films as a director were Rear window, spellbound, Life Boat and Rebecca. He never won the Oscar. This time around he lost out to Billy Wilder for The Apartment. What he accomplished from this innovative low budget film probably should have won him the Oscar. This is a low budget film for Hitchcock that in toady;s dollars would have cost about $5 million to make. The film was adapted from the 1959 lackluster novel by Robert Bloch by screenwriter Joseph Stefano. Cinematographer Jack Russell got an Academy Award nomination for photographing this film but no major film offers because of his work, He had did Orson Welles' Macbethe early in his career and was mostly involved in television and a few B movies before and after Psycho. He does a great job here along with film editor George Tomasini who edited Stalag 17, Vertigo, North By Northwest, The Birds and Cape Fear among his many fine films. A memorable music score from Bernard Herrman who did such films as Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, The Day The Earth Stood Still, Vertigo and The Man Who Knew Too Much. This is the story of a woman who steals $40,000 dollars and has plans to run away with her married lover but sees her plans and the life she lived evaporate so on the run she stops at a rundown motel off the beaten path that sits in the shadow of an old decapitated wooden turn-of-the-century mansion where the motel keeper lives with his aged mother. It's a classic horror setting and filmed in black and white. Janet Leigh in an Academy award nominated performance as Best Supporting Actress is the woman on the run and Anthony Perkins is the motel keeper who has been hounded by his domineering mother all his life and functions in his lonely existence as a motel keeper of a motel that no one stops at anymore. Also among the cast are Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, John Gavin and John McIntire. This film also received an Oscar nomination for Best Art Direction for it's great set. It's a fairly simple story with twists and turns and a little black comedy thrown in. It's a classic and comes across as kind of a bonus prize for followers of Hitchcock like he was saying here's something a little different for you to check out. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.",9,0,0,20 June 2006
To Kill a Mockingbird," They took something out of the tree to make this film, but they out something back into it too.
","A film classic adapted from a literary classic. Harper Lee's To Kill A mockingbird is one of my all-time favorite novels and Horton Foote successfully turned that novel into an Academy Award winning Best Screenplay for 1962. This film was nominated of 8 Oscars and won two. Besides Best Screenplay it earned Gregory Peck the Best Actor Oscar in the role of Atticus Finch. Child actress Mary Baham as Scout was nominated for best Supporting Actress but ironically lost out to another child actress Patty Duke for her role in The Miracle Worker. This is Peck's movie but it's also Badham's. Both are superb. This film was made in the contemporary time of the Pulitzer awarded novel and took on a giant task of bringing to the screen a beloved novel. It wasn't rushed to the screen however. This was done right. Robert Mulligan beautifully captured the look and feel of the book in this screen adaptation skillfully crafted by Foote. Perfect casting in Peck and Badham. A good supporting cast here with Robert Duvall, Alice Ghostley, William Windom, Frank Overton, Brock Peters and Estelle Evans. What can you say about this? Beloved, poignant, superb, timeless, endearing, artful, uplifting, heartwarming, tender, tragic? Say them all and give it a 10 out of a possible 10.",10,0,3,2 March 2006
A Hard Day's Night," Beatlemania in black and white
","What a fun movie. I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release as a kid in 1964. (They gave us black and white Beatles Fan Club buttons.) Looking back through a 10 year old's eye's I couldn't wait to see The Beatles in a movie. I had seen them on TV and in magazines but an entire movie about them was going to be a watershed event in the career of the group. Indoctrinated by all the corny teen movies that mostly were made prior to Hard Day's Night you knew that if they were going to be portrayed as conventional teen idols it was going to be a bust but if it was a glimpse into what it was like being a Beatle and the London mod scene of '64 and The Beatles in their irreverent but likable persona with cool clothes and Beatle boots and lots of Beatle's music and The Beatles playing their guitars it was going to be a hit. Well it didn't disappoint. I didn't even expect there to be a story. I just wanted to see the Beatles on the big screen and hear their music. (The theater even had women playing nurses in nursing outfits and stretchers for people who fainted. Cool and campy. I have to give that theater credit for all they did. The first 50 people in got Beatles wigs.) As I grew older this film did not when I would see it on TV. Sure it was dated but it was still fun. Supporting, or in this case actual actors, Norman Rossington as Norm and Victor Spinetti as the TV Director along with Wiford Brambell as Paul's 'clean' grandfather and John Junkin as Jake gave the movie a legitimate cast to cohesively hold it together and it worked well but heck, The Beatles were good on their own first time out. George Harrison's future wife, fashion model Pattie Boyd is one of the girls in the train car with the band (Her only line is 'prisonors') and even future rock and pop star Phil Collins is in a scene as a teen fan. Director Richard Lester should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award as Best Director. Alun Owen did get a nomination for Best Screenplay in the only film he ever did. George Martin also received an Academy Award nomination for Scoring of Music Adaptation. Any of The Beatles songs in this film should have been nominated for Best Original Song but they weren't. Gilbert Taylor was the cinematographer for this film. He had just come off doing the cinematography for the film Dr. Strangelove. John Jympson who had just come off editing the film Zulu was the editor. This film does a wonderful job of capturing the era of mid 1960's London and Beatlemania on film in black and white. Their next film Help, also directed by Lester tried to be too James Bondish and although good was largely silly and didn't come close to HDN. This film has been with me so long and I've seen it so many times I can't help but give it a 10.",10,22,32,7 March 2006
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One the best films of the 1970's.
","Before this came out I knew of the Ken Kesy book of which it was adapted but I had never read the book. I had not yet heard of this movie back in 1975 and as a matter of fact it hadn't been released yet when I attended a sneak preview screening of it. It blew me away as it eventually would go on to impress most everyone else that year. Milos Forman came out of nowhere to direct this film which would earn him Best Director in it's sweep of the major Academy Awards with Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Actress as well as Best Screenplay. Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher head up a stellar ensemble cast including among others, Danny DeVito, Will Sampson, Christopher Llyod, Vincent Schiavelli and Scatman Crothers. I'm sure I've seen this at least 10 times since that day of the sneak preview including a couple of more times in theaters. It's a classic. I'd give it a 10 out of a possible 10 and highly recommend it.",10,1,2,2 March 2006
Jaws," And a leisurely ocean dip would never be the same
","I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and was impressed. I had not read the novel but in 1974 Peter Benchley's book Jaws spent most of the year on the best seller list and the film's producers approached the young Steven Spielberg to direct. He was known for the big made for movie hit Duel and had recent success with his first theatrical released film Sugarland Express so he was given the monumental challenge to adapt for the screen a runaway best selling thriller for a summer release. Summer releases were usually relegated to Drive-In movies back in 1975 but because of the film's subject they took a chance on coinciding with the swimming and summer tourist season for maximum effect. The chance of a summer release of a major theatrical release and the use of a relatively unknown director was a big hit. Major summer releases became the norm and Spielberg became a legend. Spielberg would of course go on to direct such major films as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark and it's two big Indiana Jones sequels, ET, The Color Purple, the Empire of the Sun, Jurasick Park, Shindlers List and Saving Private Ryan among his big hits. He stumbled with a few misses too but the Spielberg name on any film draws interest and anticipation. Peter Benchley wrote the screenplay of his own novel along with Carl Gotlieb and some contribution from Spielberg. The monologue of the story of the Indianpolis tragedy was drafted by playwright Howard Sackler and screenwriter/director John Milius. One of filmdom's most memorable and effective music scores by John Williams received an Academy Award, one of three the film won including Best Sound and Best Film Editing. It was also nominated for Best Picture but lost to One flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. It also was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards, winning one and got seven BAFTA nominations, winning one. Cinematographer Bill Butler had been a second unit photographer on The godfather, Deliverance and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and had been the cinematographer of The Conversation. He only filmed a handful of successful films after Jaws including Biloxi Blues, Stripes and Grease and it's odd that his career nosedived and he was involved with a ton of real bad movies. It's also odd that with the success of Jaw Spielberg never used him again in any of his films. Rexford Metz was the underwater cinematographer. It's basically a simple story of a giant Great White shark who has developed a taste for humans and had began prowling the sea shore of a resort town. It's possesses almost supernatural strength and cunning and the town's police chief wants to stop it but the town's mayor doesn't want tourists to know they have a shark problem. The cop enlists the aid of a young oceanographer, fresh out of college and a WWII Navy veteran who has become a seafaring bounty hunter. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfus and Murray Hamilton star. It's a well done suspenseful drama, well written with shock, horror and a little comedy too. I would give it a 10.",10,2,4,19 May 2006
Stalag 17," Great film adaptation of a successful stage play
","This is a great Billy Wilder film, made mid-stream in his career at the height of his movie making. Wilder and Edwin Blum adapted the story for the screen from the 1951-52 Tony Award winning Broadway play by former prisoners of war Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski. José Ferrer won the Tony as Best Director in the play from which Harvey Lembeck as Harry Shapiro and Robert Strauss as Stosh Kasava reprise their stage roles in the film. Also appearing in the movie is playwright Edmund Trzcinski as Triz. William Holden leads the cast in this movie for which he won Best Actor for the 1953 Academy Awards. Stalag 17 received two other nominations fro Wilder as Best Director and for Strauss in Supporting Actor. rounding out the cast is Actor/Film Director Otto Prminger, Don Taylor, Peter Graves and Neville Brand. Veteran Cinematographer Ernest Laszlo photographed the film where much of the scenes are outdoors in the camp compound as opposed to the mostly interior set of the play. This is arguably Holden's finest film role in the comedy/drama about prisoners of war in World War II Germany that inspired the television comedy show Hogan's Heroes. I have seen this many times over the years and would give this film a 9.0 on a scale of 10 and recommend it.",9,1,5,14 March 2006
Raging Bull," Brutality as art - Art ain't always pretty
","Robert De Niro pitched the idea of this film based on the book by Jake La Motta and Joseph Carter to director Martin Scorsesse in 1974. It's the biography of Middlewieght boxer Jake La Motta and his climb and fall from fight fame spanning the years 1941-1964. De Niro put on 60 pounds in his transformation of the younger to older La Motta. This film is shot entirely in black and white by cinematographer Michael Chapman who was nominated for and should have won the Academy Award for Cinematography for 1980. From 1939 through 1966 the cinematography category was split into two awards, one for color and one for black and white. From 1967 until present the two categories were reduced to just one regardless of a film in color or black and white. Raging Bull would be the last black and white film to be nominated for Best Cinematography until 2005 when Good Night and Good Luck, shot in black and white received a nomination. Chapman had worked with Scorsesse on Taxi Driver and The Last Waltz. Di Nero won his second career Oscar and his fourth nomination in his portrayal as the self destructive demon battling and brutal Jake La Motta who in the ring masters his rage into an art form. In the supporting cast Cathy Morriarty received her only career nomination as Best Supporting Actress in her role as Vickie La Motta and Joe Pesci as Jake's brother Joey received his first career nomination as Best Supporting Actor. Also in the principal cast are Frank Vincent, Theresa Saldana and Nicholas Colasanto. The film's second Oscar win went to Theresa Schoonmaker who previously had been nominated for her editing of Woodstock. This film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Sound. Raging Bull marked Di Nero's fourth film with Scorsesse following Taxi Driver, Mean Streets and New York, New York. This film has a great script, a wonderful cast from top to bottom, amazing cinematography, sound and editing and a fantastic production design. Some call this Scorsesse's masterpiece but it certainly is Di Nero's masterpiece in acting. I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it several times since. I would give this a 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,20 March 2006
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," The Great Cate is again Good Queen Bess
","I just saw this during it's opening theatrical weekend and so far the critics have been harsh and the box office figures disappointing but there is a lot to like about this film. Director Shekhar Kapur is back in Elzibean times with his second installment in his semi-historical lavish costume drama series on the life of England's Queen Elizabeth I. Also returning from the 1998 film Elizabeth are Cate Blanchett in the title role, Geoffrey Rush as Francis Walsingham, cinematographer Remi Adefarasin, film editor Jil Bilcock, costume designer Alexandra Byrne and screenwriter Michael Hirst with a script co-written with William Nicholson. Like the first film this is filled with historical inaccuracies and thus can only be called semi-historical. It has a dark sinister feel to it to match it's content of castle intrigue and war. the film takes place between the years 1585 and 1588 covering the plots against the throne of Elizabeth by her cousin Mary Queen of Scotts (Samantha Morton) and her agents, the invasion of England by Spain's Phillip II (Jordi Mollà) and introduces us to Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen). All this can be confusing at times and the film seems to go off into different directions and tries to compact too much history into too little a time frame. The quest to try to try to make a political marriage and have the childless Elizabeth produce an heir to the throne had long passed by these years. A political marriage was still hoped for but Elizabeth was far past her potential childbearing years. She was between the ages of 52 and 55 during these years and although the most wealthy and privileged woman of her time, a woman of that age was elderly looking by 16th century standards yet Blanchett appears to be a woman of 40-45 years old by 21st century standards. It's kind of hard to get past. They needlessly try to fit the quest for an heir into the film's time frame. The ill-fated Spanish Armada's invasion of England is reduced to the time frame of a soccer match with Elizabeth in full battle armor straddling a horse with a leg on either side like a man and rallying the troops on land as the Armada approaches. Sir Walter Raleigh rides a ship ablaze into the Armada setting hundreds of Spanish ships ablaze in one great conflagration that seemingly sinks the entire Spanish fleet as Elizabeth watches from a cliff in her nightgown. It looks great but it's silly and historically farciful. The most famous fire ship battle took place in the English Channel off Calais and there were several more battles and skirmishes in the channel before the Armada set sail around Scotland and met with disastrous weather which cause most of it's ships to sink off Ireland. The route of the Armada from leaving Spain to it's return took all summer long. The battle as depicted in the film is fictional and Elizabeth was in London not on the banks of the channel watching a fire ship battle. She did inspire her troops with a speech at Tilbury on a white horse but she wore a single metal breastplate as a symbol of resolve but she wasn't clad in full shining body armor dressed for hand to hand combat. This film has a relatively weak script with a soap opera-like dialog but despite it's faults the film looks great. Every scene is like a painting. Great set decoration, lighting and costuming. It's simply beautiful to look at and Cate Blanchette is nothing short of fantastic. I think she'll get a Best Actress nomination from the Academy Awards and this film could get several more for Best Cinematography, Costume Design, Art Direction and Sound. There are a lot great sinister characters here in small supporting roles and even though Jordi Mollà as Phillip of Spain is a small non-English speaking role he's so perfect that I would give him Best Supporting Actor consideration at least. This film is certainly a visual treat and despite it's many flaws and my many criticisms I would still give it an 8.0 out of 10.",8,3,7,15 October 2007
The Deer Hunter," Wins Best Picture out of a weak field of nominated films of 1978
","I remember working across the street from a movie theater when this film came out and seeing the theater goers looking depressed and saying nothing to each other as the screenings would let out. I went to see it for myself and could see why they were so affected. It definitely is a dark and depressing movie. Very little comic relief. This film went head to head with another anti-Vietnam movie, Coming Home, for the 1978 Academy Awards. The two films together received 17 nominations and got five wins. Deer Hunter beat out Coming Home with nine nominations and five including the big one for Best Picture. Michael Cimino won for Best Director and was nominated for Best Screenplay in only his second directorial film who as a screenwriter before Deer Hunter he had success with Silent Running and Magnum force. Christopher Walken won for Best Supporting Actor in a role that would help define his career. Best Editing went to Peter Zimmer who had edited Godfather I and II and In Cold Blood among his many films. The film's fifth Oscar was for Best Sound. Rober De Niro was nominated for Best Actor and probably should have won but lost out to John Voight in Coming Home. Meryl Streep was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and Vilmos Zsigmond was nominated for Best Cinematography. Zsigmond photographed a string of big films in the 70's including Deliverence, Cinderella Liberty, MdCabe and Mrs. Miller and Sugarland Express and was a strong contender for the Oscar for his work on Deer Hunter. This film starts with a wedding and ends with a funeral with the Vietnam War in Between. It's opening is meant to build the characters but is far too long. A lot of the film is so implausible that's it hard to get ignore. lot's of violence here in it's depiction of events that are historically inaccurate that brings fabling to the story. Also in the cast are John Cazale in his last film and John Savage. This film has a lot going for it but I've passed on it many times over the years when it's come on television. It's good film-making with a strong cast but not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.",7,0,1,27 March 2006
The Producers," A funny film from the mind of Mel Brooks
","I didn't see this in a theater when it first came out. This is Mel Brooks first film and although he had won an Academy award for a cartoon and had been a big name in television as a writer and director I don't think he had enough film clout to sustain this in the theaters very long and it probably had a short run on the big screen and disappeared to turn up on late nigh TV movies. It did go on to win Brooks an Oscar for Best Screenplay and a nomination for Gene Wilder as Best Supporting Actor for 1968 but the film was released on March 19, 1968 and it didn't win it's Oscar until April 14, 1969 so it was long gone from the theaters by then. I first saw it a couple years after its release on a late night movie on TV. I immediately loved it in a cult-like way you catch onto some movies. I'd then always look for it to be on TV and catch it every time I could. Brooks of course would go on to direct such classic comedies as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie and High Anxiety in a film career as an actor/writer/lyricist/producer/director. It's the story of a Broadway producer and his accountant who come up with a plan to get enough people to over invest in a play that will close after a single performance that they can walk away with a profit. They have to find a sure-fire bomb in something that would be so offensive it will assure an opening and closing night one time run. They find it in a script by a Nazi sympathizer that glorifies the Third Reich, Cast an eccentric hippy in the lead role and hire a transvestite with a record of ineptness in directing plays to direct and they create the musical Springtime for Hitler in Germany. zero Mostel and Gene wilder lead the cast which includes Dick Shawn, Kenneth Mars, Christopher Hewett and Estelle Winwood. Clever and original for it's time with a nod to 1940's musicals and old vaudevillian schtick. I would give this a 9.0 out of 10.",9,1,1,9 June 2006
Contact," Good intelligent sci-fi from the modern age of sci-fi films
","I've only seen this film a couple of times and have never seen it on the big screen which would surely do it justice but it is interesting that despite it's big budget and huge cast of special, visual and sound effects personnel it isn't really a big special effects type film. It least it doesn't depend on the special effects to carry the story. There is a story here. Based on the novel by Carl Sagan who consulted on the film up until the time of his death, this screenplay is wonderfully drafted by James V. Hart and Michael Goldberg. Jodie Foster is a radio astronomer who learned to love the mystery of space through the hope and wonderment that she shared with her father in listening to ham radio when she was a little girl. In her research she makes contact with intelligent life from the far reaches of space that give her coded instructions on how to build a device to traverse time and space to visit their world. A project so expensive that only a government or someone extremely wealthy from the private sector could fund. Joining Foster in the cast are Tom Skerrit, Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, John Hurt, Angela Basset and Rob Lowe. Robert Zemeckis who has had a diverse and successful career with such films as the Back to the Future series, Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Romancing the Stone and the Polar Express directs. Zemeckis certainly knows how to handle a big budget production and gets the most from his producers dollars. Several veterans of Zemeckis films including cinematographer's Don Burgess and Editor Arthur Schmidt are on board this project. There is a lot going on in this movie and the weaving of footage of real life characters throughout this film takes away from some of the story itself but this is a good sci-fi film and I would give it an 8.5 out of 10.",8,0,2,21 April 2006
The Wizard of Oz," Maybe the greatest fantasy film of all-time
","This has always been a favorite of mine from childhood through adulthood. A great fantasy film adapted from the famous L. Frank Baum stories with screenplay from noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf and about a dozen others that contributed to dialog including tow of the film's stars Bert Lahr and Jack Haley. The film received six Academy Award nominations winning two for Herbert Sothart's musical score and original song for Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg. It lost the 1939 Best Picture and Best Art Direction Academy Awards to Gone With the Wind and Best Cinematography to Wuthering Heights but incredibly lost Best Effects yo The Rains Came. Director Victor Flemming had a good year in 1939 directing both Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz, two films that endearingly live on for generations. Great cinematography here from Harold Rosson who had a 50 year cinematography career that began in the early silent films and ended with Howard Hawks El Dorado in 1966. Veteran film editor Blanche Sewall skillfully edited this piece but over the years so much of this film has been cut up for television that it wasn't until recently that it's been restored to near it's original form. A fantastic cast with Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton. Amazingly Burke who plays good witch Glinda was 54 years old at the time. Five years older than Frank Morgan and 17 years older than Margaret Hamilton. I would like to see a restored version of this as I have not yet had the opportunity to and I would also like to see this up on the big screen. This is true movie magic and I would give it a 10 out of 10.",10,7,10,30 April 2006
Atonement," All dressed up with nowhere to go
",I saw this during its opening weekend in the theaters but never got around to commenting on it until now. This is a film about a girl who fabricates a lie that sends a guy to prison and tears apart a budding love and to atone for her actions she decides to wear the same hairstyle for the remaining 70 years of her life. Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) is a spoiled 13 year old rich brat who wants to be an author. Her older sister Cecilla (Keira Knightley) and the housekeepers son Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) have a thing for each other in a sexual tension kind of way but Briony likes Robbie too but Robbie scolds Briony down at the swimming hole and gets on her wrong side. spying on Robbie and Cecilla she misinterprets something between them and grows to like Robbie even less. Robbie writes Cecilla a dirty love letter and they finally consummate their passion in a quickly in the library. This is the only romance in the movie and your supposed to believe that it sets the stage for years of undying love between Robbie and Cecilla as they are separated forever by prison and war. A family friend Paul Marshall (Benedict Cumberbatch) who owns a chocolate factory visits the Taliis' and ends up molesting their cousin Lola Quincey (Juno Temple) and he comes to the diner table with scratches visible but nobody puts two and two together. Lola's twin brothers run away one night and a search party is formed to search the estate grounds for them. Paul takes the opportunity of the secluded darkness to force himself on Lola. Briony says she saw the rapist and it was Robbie. Robbie is the only one who couldn't have done it as he is far away from the scene having found the lost boys and is bringing them back but everybody believes Briony and Robbie gets sent to prison only to be let out if he agrees to fight in the front lines of world War II. And on and on this ridiculous story goes in the screen adaptation of the Ian McEwan novel by Hampton. Ramola Garai plays Briony at age 18 and Vanessa Redgrave plays Briony at 80. Wonderful cinematography by Seaus McGarvey and production design by Sarah Greenwood with art direction from Ian Baile but its like a decorated wedding cake. Pretty to look at but not much dietary value except for the Dunkirk scene. I would give this a 5.5 out of 10.,5,0,2,14 April 2009
The Godfather," One of the all-time greats
","I saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and went back again and have seen it numerous times on television since. Francis Ford Coppopla has been fortunate to have not had just a single career defining masterpiece but several and this is one of them. He'll likely have one or two more masterpieces to add to his arsenal of enduring works before he is done. This ensemble cast is wonderful with Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Sterling Hayden, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda, Al Martino and on an on. Nonimated for 10 Academy Awards it won surprisingly only three in Best Actor for Marlon Brando, Best Screenplay for Mario Puzo adapted from his novel with Francis Ford Coppola, and the big prize Best Picture. James Caan, AL Pacino and Robert Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor, the most ever from a single film in an acting category but so many from the same film caused a split in the vote and Joel Grey from Caberet ended up with the Oscar. Godfather went head to head against Caberet for the 1972 Academy Awards with Caberet wining six to Godfather's three. The Godfather was also nominated for costume design, film editing, sound and music score. Omitted was Gordon Willis with his brilliant cinematography. Willis would go on to be a favorite of Woody Allen in photographing Annie Hall and seven other Allen films. Willis, like many involved in the Godfather would also do Godfather II and III. Production Designer Dean Tavoularis team of Set Decorator Phillip smith and Art Director Warren Clymer give this film a rich look and an excellent period piece atmosphere along with Costume Designer Anna Hill Johnstone. Nino Rota's music score gives the film the flavor of a fine Italian wine. He scored all of Federico Fellini's films in Italy including La Vita Dolce and 8Â½ as well as scoring such films as La Strada, Obsession, War and Peace and Romeo and Juliet in his long career. This film also features great non-original music from Berlin to Bach and Mozart. Editor William Reynolds would have had quite an ambitious editing project with this three hour film and his skill paid off. The sequel Godfather II was a great film and one of the greatest and most recognized sequels in film history but I would have left it there and not made it a trilogy with Godfather III. I don't know how long this film has been #1 on the IMDb top 250 but it will likely be there in that spot for some time and it will take a film made after it to knock it out of the top spot. Maybe a film not yet made. I would give this a 10 and highly recommend it.",10,1,4,23 March 2006
