Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," High Hopes Fulfilled
","I have just come back from the 12:01 showing on Wednesday morning, East Coast time, so I am lucky to be among the first of the general public to have seen the film. What a knockout! I have to say that I had very high expectations for this film, and I was not disappointed in any measure. Lucas has come so far from A New Hope, and yet everything about this film was right on the money. I can only imagine what it would have been like to see the original trilogy produced with the stunning array of technology displayed herein. It was such smooth digital effects work that I rarely noticed it was digital. There are points to nitpick, but if the original serves as any example, no Lucas creation will be ever be free from the critiques of its most diehard fans. All will enjoy The Phantom Menace!",10,0,0,19 May 1999
