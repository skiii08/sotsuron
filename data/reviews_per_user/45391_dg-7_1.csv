Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointing, but.....
","'Star Wars - The Phantom Menace' is placed within the deep lore of the jedi myth, the force that guides everything in the galaxy.  People who are interested in the deep fabric of the story will like this movie best.  The rest of the movie is forced, uninvolving, and kind of desperate especially when it comes to trying to create the new Han Solo, the new Darth Vader. Jar Jar Binks?  Darth Moll?  No, it just didn't happen.This is a movie that has to establish everything so why does the movie contain so many scenes similar to the original trilogy? The celebration, the light sabre duel in the corridor(and death), the imperial 'stompers'. None of this sticks.  The film is a triumph of visual effects(although I found the federation robot army a bit glassy) but in the service of what, really? Kids are not compelled by this kind of stuff, not the politicking or the King Arthur elements.What I liked about the film, aside from the technical elements, were some of the actors strangely enough?  Jake Lloyd was very engaging as Anakin and Liam Neeson found the right tone of reverence and age for the role of the Jedi Master, although I'm not sure why his body didn't vanish at the end......but never mind.  Ewan McGregor looks lost in his role but I guess staring at a blue screen will do that to you.  Natalie Portman was quite fetching as the Queen.I liked the deep respect and awe shown for the jedi myths and procedures and Darth Moll was a suitably fearful and challenging villain and his dual light sabre was splendid to watch.I am looking forward to the next two installments which will no doubt be more meaty and aggressive, but Lucas really has to be more sharp and less naive and generic with the screenplay. The Queen says, 'they've won this round'.  A boxing analogy? And on.The identity of Anakin's father is a deep mystery, although how Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia came to be most certainly is not.  I recommend the film, in spite of itself, even though it pales in comparison to any of the previous three films, even though it lacks heart and magic.  It is an important movie, undeniably.  It's just a shame that with all of the resources that it wasn't a whole lot better and smarter.To anyone who says that they'd had enough of the original Star Wars characters, I say that I couldn't disagree with you more.
