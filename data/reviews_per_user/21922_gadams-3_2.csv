Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Brilliant... but there's just some small bad things
","First of all, I love this movie, it's my favourite. Being a true a bomafied fan of the trilogy, i couldn't help but be caught up in Phantom fever.However, this is not as good as many say it is. Sure, it's my favourite movie, but that doesn't mean to say there's nothing wrong with it. Firstly, despite what other IMDb users say, Jake Lloyd is terrible. I can't understand how Robin Gurland (Casting Director)and Lucas himself could interview more than three thousand Anakins, and end up with him.But this is not the main problem. George Lucas, that man, that wonderful man that created a whole galaxy, paid very little attention to the actual filming. It was a rushed process, and you can see this on film.Even with all of the absolutely amazing effects and visuals, these cannot be relied upon to make a great movie. Actors will always dominate movies, and if you don't pay enough attention to them, then you end up with problems. The actors have taken it upon themselves to do some acting. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are good. They are both extremely good actors, but they don't seem to give their best here. Natalie Portman is more than just a pretty face. The fact that she doesn't look like a barbie doll certainly helps her role. She turns in a good performance, and has some good scenes.But in my opinion, Ian McDiarmid turns in the best performance(s). He is certainly a very good actor, and is one of my favourite bad guys.The dialogue is another of the annoying things. Although there are some really good moments in it, half of it is just there to fill in the gaps. I think Lucas simply needs to hire an additional script writer, as he did on Return of the Jedi. The story is very good. An intelligent story of good vs evil that has you sucked in from the beginning. And John Williams. What can I say. My favourite score ever. Overall, this is a great movie, the best IMHO. But there are too many 'small things' that make this movie an 8/10. Which, in an official review, would be four stars. Don't look at this movie and love it, and then say how good everything was, just love it say how good the good things were. There's *almost* as many!",Null,0,0,1 March 2000
Armageddon," Wow! What a movie!
","What a treat it is to watch this. For starters, it has a massive amount of character development, which is odd for this genre. I've actually read about people saying this movie forgot about characters and simply went for action. What are you on about. The first hour of the movie is almost pure character development. It's also got some of the best action sequences I've ever seen. Being a massive fan of sci-fi, it's great fun to watch space shuttles mauevering around, dodging debris. Its hunour element is great, actually making some application to genuine wit instead of stupid throw-away one-liners.Seriously, this movie nearly made me cry. Bruce Willis is such a good actor, you can't help but give in to the sadness of the end. It's all a result of the afore-mentioned character development. Trevor Rabins surprisingly emotional score also helps with the emotional quality of this movie. In one word, this movie is HEROIC. Everything about it is about being a hero. So see it, if you haven't already. It's not the most realistic movie of all time, It's no 'Saving Private Ryan', but it is a great movie(What else would you expect from Michael Bay and Jerry Brucheimer). 9/10",Null,6,9,19 March 2000
