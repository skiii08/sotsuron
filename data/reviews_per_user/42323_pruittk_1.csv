The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project was disappointing.
","I admit I got caught up in the hype of the Blair Witch Project like the majority of you horror fans out there, and I spent my $7.50 to see it the opening night. But if the previews had given me a better idea of what I was in for I wouldn't have wasted my time or money.The filming of the movie was horrible.  Ten minutes into the movie I felt hungover from the constant movement of the camera and I had to keep my eyes closed through the last 80 minutes of the movie just to keep from taking a trip to the restroom.  Motion sickness seemed to be a problem for most of the people in the theater as well.The first 30 minutes of the movie was very slow and the last hour didn't live up to my expectations either.  I wouldn't suggest going to see this movie.  Even if you have a great imagination I don't think The Blair Witch Project could be considered scary.  However, if you like watching bad home movies then you will like this film.  In my opinion the movie wasn't even worthy of a blockbuster rental fee of $2.99.",1,1,3,13 August 1999
