Despicable Me 2," Best Film I've seen in a long time
","After watching the first one only a few weeks ago to see what the fuss was about I fell in love with the film and couldn't wait for number 2 to come out.As an adult I still love children's films but for me this is not a kids film, it is a family film with enough comedy in to entertain the parents as well as the kids.From start to finish I was laughing my head off.The minions are by far the funniest things ever and I am now a massive fan of these films and in love with the minions.Definitely worth a watch, and I will be adding this to my DVD collection.",10,2,4,14 July 2013
