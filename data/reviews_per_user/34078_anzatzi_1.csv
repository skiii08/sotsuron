Skyfall," so tiresome, can't anyone plot an action movie?
","The many reviews here have cataloged the glaring weakness of this movie--so I'll just add my own personal observations Score: the score of this movie was constantly obtrusive and shared many similarities with the Batman Begins score.Super Villain: How long will it take Hollywood to realize super villains who think of everything--and I mean everything--suck the drama out of movies? Judy Dench as Bond girl: yikes.Action sequences being monitored by tech analysts: This was somewhat camp-ily acceptable in a soap opera like '24', but now it has become a Hollywood big budget stable.Pre-credit action sequence overwhelming the entire movie: check! Disolute super hero--err--super agent--going on a bender' check!",1,5,11,30 March 2013
