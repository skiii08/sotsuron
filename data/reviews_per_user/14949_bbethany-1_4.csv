The New World," Horrible
","I am happy that Thomas Edison lived to invent the light bulb and the phonograph, but after the ordeal of sitting through The New World, I wonder whether the moving picture was a good idea. Terrence Malick has marked out a new world of incoherence in film-making. Not one frame of this movie makes any sense. It is so bad that you don't even have the pleasure of laughing at it. To weep over it would only be tears wasted on something Dead On Arrival. The actors--all of them--seem stunned, gob-smacked to have to utter unutterable lines. Ms Kilcher is beyond clueless. Farrell, Bale, and Plummer seem to be in a dream--no, a nightmare--from which they can't awaken. Jonathon Pryce gets off easy in his 5 seconds on screen. He has to say nothing. The depiction of the Natives is embarrassing. The music---Mozart!!-has no connection to what's going on. I rate Badlands as one of the 40 or 50 best films. This one is the worst. Is there a rating below 1? I wish.",1,2,8,23 February 2006
Match Point," Allen's best film ever. May be spoilers.
","It is extraordinary that a film maker as skilled and experienced as Woody Allen has after 36 years and some 40 movies as writer/director, made his Masterpiece. Hannah And Her Sisters, Crimes And Misdemeanors, Husbands And Wives, Annie Hall are undeniably superb, but with Match Point, Allen has risen to a very high level indeed. Two things immediately set this film apart from his others: He doesn't act in it, and he has chosen London--not his beloved New York or Paris--in which to unravel this story of steaming lust, lethal ambition, and numbing irony. Johnathan Rhys-Meyers is Chris Wilton, a tennis pro who will never reach the top and has thus insinuated himself into the upper-crust world of Chloe Hewett (Emily Mortimer), daughter of a very successful business man (Brian Cox). Her brother has an American girlfriend, Nola, (a brilliant Scarlet Johansson) who is voluptuous, reckless and willful, and who is drawn to Chris. They have a brief fling, but the ambitious Chris goes on to marry Chloe and to take a position in her father's company. He's beyond his class but adapts quickly and has some success. Chloe badly wants to have a child but they have trouble conceiving. Nola, a budding actress, breaks up with Chloe's brother and disappears into her theatre world in London until a chance encounter with Chris leads to an entangled affair that leaves him desperate to find a way out. This is further complicated when Nola becomes pregnant. What ensues is intense, gripping, and bizarrely logical.Woody Allen has captured the louche flippancy and fluent ease of the rich and privileged while punctuating this tale with a dark undercurrent rarely seen in his films. There's a wonderful foreshadowing scene early on that resonates ironically in the fevered machinations of Chris to extricate himself from the Hell he has created. The script is seamless--not a word is out of place--and the music frames the story around visits to the opera. For once Allen forsakes vintage 30's jazz for passages from Verdi and Rossini. The settings and costumes are spot on and the pace of the film is impeccable. Brilliant editing.I think the writing and directing are Oscar caliber, as is Johansson's performance. I saw Match Point here in France. I'd like to be in New York when there will be (Nov. 29) a special screening at Lincoln Center with Allen fielding comments and questions from the audience. This should create quite a buzz and stir for old Woody. Imagine: at 70 years he's done a job that Hitchcock might envy.",10,21,40,13 November 2005
Closer," crossbreeding
","The subtext of homo-eroticism by proxy drives this film. What forces these men to obsessively cling to hopelessly frayed relationships is that they are then erotically bound to each other without ever touching. A brilliant idea brilliantly conceived by Patrick Marber. Mike Nichols, as in Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? and Carnal Knowledge, nails the irony of sex and love: men and women live in different Universes. And how about the small miracle of a sex-drenched movie without a single embarrassing, artsy scene of sweaty, writhing copulators? The early scene of cyber-sex between the two men reveals their shallowness and immaturity. The women caught between them can only try to cope as best they can in a testosterone-charged power struggle between these two fighting cocks.",9,2,5,23 January 2005
Batman Begins," Yuck
","ChristopherNolan made a lot of serious mistakes in this film. First, casting Christian Bale who has all the charisma and gravitas of a pumped-up Pauly Shore. But so what? This film is an obvious feeble stab at resurrecting a moribund Batman series that should have gone to a peaceful demise 8 years ago. Katie Holmes? Please. Probably a nice kid, but she'd barely survive a casting call for summer theater in Akron, Ohio. The pretentious, plodding script is lugubrious, morose and utterly incredible--even for a comic book. What is this nonsense about Shangri-La and Ninja gibberish and psychobabble about fear and revenge? Don't even ask about the ludicrously lame scenes of battle and urban catastrophe--pathetic. The editors should be taken out and shot. But wait! No! They had nothing to work with! If you need one simple proof of how rotten this is, just consider the great character actor Gary Oldman embarrassingly mired in this bat dung. I did however love Rutger Hauer as Donald Rumsfeld. Michael Caine should have paid to have his scenes deleted. Morgan Freeman, the default Black eminence in many recent films, phones in his routine performance. Liam Neeson, a superb actor, is again relegated to a murky back-story clich√©d role as in Gangs of New York and a couple of later Star Wars pics. One standout in this mess is Cillian Murphy as a preening, smarmy uber-yuppie. Now if HE had played Bruce Wayne and Tim Burton had written and directed and Blanchett or Kidman had been Rachel Dawes and Gary Oldman were Scarecrow, who knows?",1,23,50,17 June 2005
