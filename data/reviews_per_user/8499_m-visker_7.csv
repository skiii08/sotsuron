Casablanca," Casablanca, an American Beauty
","This movie was a wonderfully shot movie. I may have not found it all that interesting but it had some beautiful photography. I thought the story line drag a little in some parts, and I may stand alone in that however the visuals I think made up for my lack in interest. This movie was shot in black and white and I don't think it could have been better in any other way, the black and white added glamor and beauty to a lot of the scenes. Also the lighting was key in this movie, a lot of the lighting was soft lighting especially when Ingrid Bergman was the focus of the frame. The image had a soft filter and it gave Bergman this innocent and glow. Using the soft lighting in this movie also added to the romantic mood of a lot of the scenes. The use of shadows was also very apparent in this movie. One scene that used low key lighting was when Bergman is up in Humphrey Bogarts room hiding, the lights are off and she has a large shadow casting across her, this use of shadow gives us the tone of the scene, and really insist that she must stay hidden in the shadows. Casablanca also uses high key and hard lighting in the film to create crisp and clear pictures as well. Soft and hard lighting will even be used in the same scene. An example of this being used is in the ending scene when Bogart is saying goodbye to Bergman's character. The camera will do a close up of Bogarts face and it will be in hard lighting, the image is very clear and crisp of his face, we can see every wrinkle under his eyes and such, however when the shot switches to a close up of Bergman's face we see her in a soft lighting like I have mentioned before. This make her look young and glowy. The contrast is very apparent and really sets the two characters apart. Casablanca is a classic movie and I urge you to pay a lots of attention to the images and photography on the screen!",8,0,1,9 May 2014
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver
","Is a strong movie that covers a different topic and is a bit taboo. With the unstable main character, Travis, who is the way he is because of time in the war. He is a taxi driver (hence the name) by name and goes and sees porn by day. Although he isn't your usual good guy he does want to help and make the world better and his way of helping is by helping a 13 year old girl, Iris, who recently was left by her pimp, oh did I mention she was a 13 year old prostitute. This movie is definitely a psychological drama and Scorsese uses certain editing tools to increase our eagerness. He uses a lot of slow camera movement to build up the expectation. The movie also takes place in New York City, which is paints at this horrifying place by making the scenes dark and unpleasant. One editing tool that Scorsese uses that really put us in the mind of Travis were the voice over. One example of this was when Travis is reading his diary, but all of sudden mid sentence the shot cuts and repeats itself. Your first thought might be that the movie skip or there was some type of error, but no, it actually is meant to abruptly stop and start over again. This edit is done to show us how Travis' mind really works, it give us an inside look on how Travis' thoughts flow, and his current mental state. Taxi Driver is a high energy and definitely interesting, and it's always fun to see act Robert De Niro in a film, especially a younger version than I am use to!",8,0,0,8 May 2014
The Graduate," The Graduate
","This movie has been on my 'movies I need to watch' list for a very long time and I can finally check it off! This is a brilliantly edited movie and extremely charming. It is great that even though this movie was made in the 60s it is still relate-able to teens today. The idea of not knowing what you want to do, but you know you want to do something 'different' is still around, the youth felt misunderstood and separated from their parents and earlier generations. The Graduate is able to showcase this idea and make it funny. The Graduate as I mention before is fantastically edited. One scene that I enjoyed was in the beginning when Ben is just walking around his house at his homecoming party and is being constantly stopped by adults bombarding him with questions. The camera follows Ben as he quickly ends conversations but is only trapped into a new after only a few steps. We are able to feel the annoyance building up in Ben and also get the feeling of becoming claustrophobic, the camera stay tight near Ben as if we are standing right next to him. Another example of great editing is of course the scene when Mrs. Robinson tries to seduce Ben. We see Ben's shocked face and then the camera will cut to Mrs. Robinson and show a quick shot of nudity but only to cut back to Ben's face again. This technique is inventive and interesting. Showing us what Ben sees but only for a second at a time. This movie has so many amazing things about it, it's such a charming and relate-able movie even when it does get a little ridiculous.",9,1,1,8 May 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Singin in the Rain
","There are a lot of good things to say about this movie, the acting and characters, the colorful set and costumes, and of course the musical numbers. Being that I am a big musical fan I thought this movie was amazing and fun. Some people may find that when characters break out in song in the middle of a conversation it is unrealistic and weird, but that's exactly it! It is unrealistic and that is what makes it so much fun, it takes you into another world, one not like our own. It isn't real life and you can get lost in this world on the screen. Singin in the Rain is no different, while watching this movie it is hard not to get absorbed in the story, and you find yourself smiling and tapping your foot along to the music. A lot of the musical numbers are up beat and playful like 'Make them Laugh' 'Good Morning' and of course the famous 'Singin in the Rain' Not only were the musical numbers great to listen to but they were amazing to watch, the color really popped off the screen. This movie was made with Technicolor and this was still new to the audience because a lot of movies were still being made in black and white at this time. So Singin in the Rain really took advantage of filming in color by making the sets full of color, and having very vibrant costumes. Singin in the Rain is a fun movie to watch and I recommend it to musical lovers and haters alike! This may be the musical to change your mind!",9,0,1,8 May 2014
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction
","With no doubt Pulp Fiction is a modern day classic, and there is good reason why there is so much hype around the movie. The story can be a little confusing at times to follow due to the fact that there is two stories happening at once, but when you get the flow of the movie down it is a very enjoyable to watch. The acting is phenomenal and the writing is amazing, it is no surprise that the movie won an Oscar for it's original screenplay. The dialogue is smart and witty through-out the movie, it also uses silences to make scenes more powerful and intense. The conversations feel real as if these people, even though ridiculous, could exist. The editing in this movie is also very strong, one scene in which I find it to be great is the overdose and adrenaline shot scene. Vincent is speeding down the highway with Mia who is having an overdose, he is frantically calling the drug dealer, the camera then switches to the drug dealer, the shot is slow and doesn't cut to anything, giving the effect that he is in no rush to pick up his phone, and is very unaware for what is about to happen. Once Vincent gets to the house we hear the car screech down the road, the camera follows the drug dealer out and the camera isn't quick or steady but instead shaky as if we are running behind following him outside. This adds to the chaos of the scene. Once they have Mia laying down the camera switches between the characters faces, really letting us the panic the two guys are having and the two girls don't seem nearly as worked up. Right before the shot is given we are given zoomed shots of Vincent's face and the drug dealers face again, there is almost no sound, all of this just intensifies the scene and builds up suspense. This scene is serious and yet entertaining because of the banter between the two men. Pulp Fiction is a great movie in many ways and isn't for the faint of hearts, Tarantino is very innovative and uses editing, cinematography and sound to really capture the mise-en-scene of this film.",9,1,3,9 May 2014
Psycho," Psycho 1960
","Psycho is a one of a kind, the fact that there is even a remake of this movie is comical, and the remake compared to the original is laughable. Hitchcock's Psycho is intriguing and suspenseful, however I wouldn't personally call Psycho a scary movie, but it definitely leaves you with an uneasy feeling by the end of the movie. Hitchcock is known for many things, one being his use of McGuffins. A McGuffin is when a movie has an item or piece of information that seems to be important to the story but really has no meaning, it is used for suspense. In Psycho the McGuffin would definitely be the envelope of money, in the start we believe that the whole movie is going to surround Marion Crane and how she will get away with the stolen money. But Hitchcock then throws us off track when our main lead is killed within the first 30 minutes of the movie. I liked this aspect of the movie; I found it interesting to spend so much time on the plot only to completely change it, something I personally have never experienced before. Of course many people know the famous shower scene in Psycho, when Marion Crane is murdered. This scene is used as a great example of the use of quick shots, being that this short scene has so many shots, and the shots themselves are so strategically framed. Not once is there any nudity or gore, never do we see the knife cut Marion, but instead we are almost forced to visualize the violence in our own heads, filling in the blank. Psycho is a classic Hitchcockian film; it really shows and illustrates his style and like most of his movies, is very entertaining.",9,2,3,5 May 2014
The Wizard of Oz," The Wizard of Oz, An American Treasure
","The Wizard of Oz is an American classic undoubtedly. The movie makes you feel as if you are in this magical world along side Dorothy, as if you are lost as well. Everything from the characters, music, set design, and story line makes us fall in love. The Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, and Tin-man seem like old friends and are easy to relate to. They each touch on a fear that most people have on some level. The Cowardly Lion shows fear (in general) and uncertainty. The Tin-man shows vulnerability with oneself and emotions. And the Scarecrow lacks self-worth dealing with intelligence. And even Dorothy, she represents the fear of being lost, and leaving your comfort zone. The characters help the audience connect to the movie more, and become more emotionally invested. Not only is the characterization great in this movie, but just looking at the it all is nothing less than beautiful. The elaborate sets and colorful images makes your eyes dance around the screen. This movie was made when color was first still being introduced, and even though it wasn't the first colored movie, it definitely was the first that really took advantage of the use of color. If you haven't seen The Wizard of Oz yet you missing out on a fantastic movie!",10,5,7,17 April 2014
