Hereditary," It is what it is.
","Like someone was saying here, this is an ok movie to watch home and streaming. It's not particularly scary, the acting was very good though. The plot gets predictibile at times and it can feel pretty slow to advance.",5,1,1,26 August 2018
Aquaman," A complete disaster
",U couldn't decide which one's worse. This or Jupiter ascending? I don't even know what I'm giving it 2 stars for.,2,0,2,18 March 2019
Divergent," good acting - bad writing
","The film itself is not bad, but it is just too predictable. I don't mind predictable films, but this one just got boring. You know way too soon who's the bad guy, who's the bad girl, who's the good guy and the good girl, who's going to fall in love, who will die and how the film would end. The story line is also not quite original, and there was one funny line in the whole movie.It reminded me a lot of Hunger games, probably because you have yet again the shy, scared pretty girl who turns out to exceed all expectations.That her mother was a divergent as well could also be guessed way too soon.in conclusion: not a bad idea, but predictability made it quite boring.",5,0,0,22 July 2014
Aladdin," It's official

It's a no no no no.",3,4,5,17 August 2019
The Lion King," Atrocious
","There is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about how bad ut was. Visually, stunning. But that's all there is. You feel nothing during or after this film.",1,3,5,12 October 2019
Midsommar," Surprised by the high score
","This movie is nothing more than an insult to yeh Swedes.
Honestly, it's nothing more than another one in a long string of humiliating hits the Swedes have to take for some reason.",1,6,8,30 March 2020
Elysium," Propaganda
","It's a great film in terms of teh visuals, otherwise just Hollywood propaganda.",5,1,7,25 November 2018
Edge of Tomorrow," Like someone already said here, this movie doesn't take you for an idiot
","I like Cruise, I may be biased, but I don't think he's ever done a bad film.
That being said, the story is great and the action not lacking.",9,2,2,27 April 2020
It Chapter Two," Pretty bad
",It felt like the idea was to purposely maienit bad . Every scene seemed stupid. Like a b class horror movie.,4,0,0,7 November 2019
Lucy," A mix of science and fiction?
","I think bad reviews come mostly from people who want to show other how good their science is. Fair enough, this film starts from the premise that humans only use 10% of their brains and Lucy can break this barrier and reach a whole new level in human evolution. This leitmotiv was quite smartly picked to raise interest,although scientifically inaccurate. However this film excites the mind of those who REALLY know physics and know how few limits there are in what we can achieve in pushing our evolution through science to become indistinguishable from magic. 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' I personally enjoyed every bit of the movie and, as it took me to a journey into the far far future, where humans can overcome their humanity and become real Gods.Enjoy this film and let your mind explore the impossible.",8,310,542,6 October 2014
Braveheart," A film to rule them all.
","There is no greater director, no greater actor than Mel Gibson. There is no greater Hollywood film than Braveheart. All else is trifle.",10,3,5,14 February 2020
