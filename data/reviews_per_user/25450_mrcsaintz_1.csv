The Avengers," Well spent money
","First, I need to say I really like this type of movies, super heroes, sci-fi, fantasy stuff, for me, this is entertainment. Not everyone fills the same, so it's important to consider this point before you can think I can be over-reacting. Now the movie, from all I've seen, this was the one that really made it full, you laugh, you get angry, and you even get sad, but it's only because the movie ended! Spider-Man is also one of my favorites, just now surpassed by this one. The story from Spider-Man is more linear, so here it might get a point, but the thing is, this is fantasy from the comics coming true on the screen, like back then we were a child, I couldn't have all the numbers so, I'm not much into the accuracy. I only hope this is a good start for a sequel.Have fun watching this one, you won't regret it, if you are on the same page regarding my first statement.Regards,",9,1,5,4 May 2012
