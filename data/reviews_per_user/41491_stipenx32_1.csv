The Incredible Hulk," Hulk Smash
","This is a true Hulk movie. Personally a true Hulk fan I am more analytical then most and yet I loved it. Hulk is all about the monster and rage inside. The action was spot on. The chaos and havoc brought the Hulk alive. The only failing is the CGI, but how real can a big green monster be? In my opinion if you like the Ang Lee version then this is probably not the movie for you and you are not a true Hulk fan. But, for the rest enjoy because this movie is up there with Iron Man even better cause of the action. I am a action buff. The final fight was way more satisfying than the final fight of Iron Man by far. Norton was great. Liv was good. And, the pacing is perfect. SPOILER. There is a cameo by Stark and hints of Captain America but no appearance that I saw of. That kind of was a downer. But, all and all this is a great summer blockbuster.",10,3,7,13 June 2008
