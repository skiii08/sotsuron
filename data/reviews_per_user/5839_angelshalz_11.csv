Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Visually Appealing but missing the main substance
","Star Wars-Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is filled with unprecedented creatures, beautiful scenery, and mind blowing special effects, making it an 'eye candy' kind of a movie. Although the character development is flat, the narration is mediocre in it's' attention to various issues, and George Lucas was risky in putting a cute, blonde, typical, and puny (of all things!) ten-year-old boy to be our sophisticated, and fast- paced Jedi/Sith-to-be, the visual effects are too pretty to pay any attention to this stuff anyway. Frankly, I, being younger, have the knowledge to say that this movie would serve as entertainment to all children ranging from two to twelve. Others, would have certainly found one weakness or the other like the ones I've just mentioned. Oh Well, I guess looks appeal to the mass.",6,0,1,19 April 2007
Juno," Is it really THAT charming?????
","It does have a witty dialogue, it is unique, but somehow I could neither relate to it nor get really entertained. First of all, Juno seems to be the right teenager to get pregnant. She's strong, high headed, down to earth and convincing. And at the same time she does not always play it safe. Her family is extremely supportive and the boy that she sleeps with is her best friend (sensitive type) that loves her. Also, she manages to find the PERFECT person (Jennifer Garner) to adopt her to-be-child. In all reality, a person is not that lucky. It is ten times worse to be pregnant as a teenager. But then again, Juno is the type of person that seems to have it all and can pull through, even with humor, love and charm in her life. Another important thing is that she is still finding herself and is not sure about her future or her goals. So it wouldn't be a life long scar, discouraging her to be the way she always wanted to be. I am sure that in general people will have a lot more pressure to face when they test positive. Anyways, the background music is so attuned to the main character and the movie's flavor that I was impressed. I am positive that this is not a let-down movie but if you are highly religious and are against the main theme of it, PLEASE don't take your chances and go watch it",7,1,5,18 July 2008
Spider-Man 3," A hodge-podge of intense emotion and action sequences
","Spiderman 3 would be a better movie if there hadn't been so many things happening at once. Sandman, Green Goblin, Venom and Spiderman's dark sidehow many things? In my opinion, they should have toned it down and put some stuff in spiderman-4. My sister ( was disappointed that Venom (arch nemesis) was killed so easily. BUTAlthough all of these conflicts seemed overwhelming at times, I felt that this movie was taken in the best way with all of those conflicts. Anyways, Richard Corliss (Time Magazine) accurately commented on how the male characters in this movie were more ahem* sensitive than usual. I daresay that Spiderman cried much more than all the women put together in the movie and at the end his sobbing became so intense that my cousins started laughing. Maybe I am weird, but Peter Parker seemed so emotional and boyish to me that I was happy when he turned into the tough and insensitive guy for a change. Sandman also shed many tears, sinking this movie to an unusual depth. Although I found this male crying thing different, I'm not sure whether it aroused tears or snickers. I guess it's different for everybody and you'll have to decide for yourself",6,1,2,18 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Special Effects Carry the Film
","Star Wars Episode 2: The Attack of the Clones is brilliantly filmed with special effects filling every scene, ultimately adding a sense of fast-paced adventure and franticness. The last forty-five minutes of the production includes an extremely breathtaking war between good and bad, leading to an awesome fight between Yoda and Count DookuÂ… What I have exemplified in the first two sentences, are the positive aspects of this film: The special effects, and the last forty five minutes. Unfortunately, the negative points (in my opinion) are quite noticeable. The acting is not as effective as it could be, and is inspired by a stilted script which contains only some potential humor and zero possible romance. The love story is too rash and somehow wrong even though Portman and Christensen are apparently good actors. Ewan McGregor is okay as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but could add more emotion into his role. What I thought to have been a big improvement however (which other people savoring the older trilogy may disagree with) is the CGI version of Yoda. He looks less funny than how he did as a complex puppet and has many more kid fans now. Therefore, this second prequel to 'Star Wars' does have many things to offer, just don't depend on impeccable dialogue and breath-taking amour to decide your satisfaction.",7,1,1,20 April 2007
Schindler's List," A gritty and moving picture
","Schindler's List should be a punishment: a chastisement for not reading your textbooks properly about the Holocaust: a horrible genocide in which more than 6 million Jews were killed: an immense population. It gives us a very visual outlook of the inhumanity which was faced in the concentration camps. Taken like a documentary with black and white photography, Schindler's List is scary because it is real. There is also this chilling background music composition mixing Jewish hymns (very, very solemn) and another sad score by John Williams. I watched this in my history class in case you were wondering. So, should you watch this movie? I am not recommending it to high school students who've already read 'Night' or learned in depth about the process of Hitler's 'Final Solution' unless they find it interesting. In fact, I think 'Life is Beautiful' is a more uplifting movie to watch in order to heal our sorrow after reading about Auschwitz and all those treacherous Jewish ghettos. Oh yeah, the actors in Schindler's List were brilliant: very convincing. The setting was brilliant. The ending was in my opinion the best part of the movie, so if you start watching it, don't stop during the middle because of the atrocities.",8,9,13,18 July 2008
Shrek the Third," good time pass with a couple of classic scenes....
","Many people thought that Shrek's charming dialogue and witty actions were held in abeyance with this sequel. Shrek did not spend enough time being an ogre, but an irresponsible person that can neither take charge of the kingdom nor face fatherhood. Since Shrek wants to desperately leave Fiona's Kingdom and go back to his 'vermin-filled shack (the swamp),' he decides to abdicate the thrown to Arthur, a distant relative to the royal family of Far Far Away who is now the acknowledged loser of a medieval high schoolBut some complications ensue and once again we are introduced to Prince Charming who can barely even pose as an ostensible threat. The terror faced by their kingdom is used to arouse laughter, with strange accidents and weird villains. But I have to say that the funniest part of the movie is when the Frog King dies. Merlin was also hilarious. With that being said, although Shrek the Third is not as good as the previous two movies in the series, it does evoke good laughter. Definitely not a failure.",7,1,2,18 July 2008
The Dark Knight," dark and complex, yet engrossing and entertaining.
","Batman was always more dark than the other superheroes. He was always mysterious and detached, so much so, that we, as his fans, wondered if he ever had a perplexing moment. The cool thing about 'The Dark Knight,' is that it is flooded with such interesting and perplexing circumstances and characters, that by the end we learn very clearly what his role is in Gotham City. In fact, the entire movie was a very engrossing and realistic outtake on the situation of Gotham city, which is a solemner and shadier version of downtown Chicago. It shows us the bigger picture: there is a population of people protected by a police commissioner (James Gordon), a district attorney (Harvey Dent), and the batman. And and all of them are forced to work through dilemmas that question their faith for the good. Then you have the scheming underground mob who are arrogant about their plans but become blinded by the Joker, whose lack of plans and wantonness is terrifying, but whose dialogue is incisive. Rachel Dawes has a more complex role that strengthens the plot and makes the whole thing more interesting. So overall, I think it's an amazing movie. The acting was brilliant. I enjoyed Batman's voice, the Joker's personality and Harvey Dent's transformation. There was nothing perfunctory, but perfect.",10,1,3,19 July 2008
A Beautiful Mind," Do I even have to write this review?
","Although this movie is not made to be romantic, I still find there to be a lot of passion between the two main actors, Crowe and Connelly. Anyways, what is this movie about? Well, It centers around the life of an introverted, schizophrenic, but brilliant mathematician, John Nash and how he deals with his sickness. I like the way it was taken, I really do. It almost moved me to tears when I watched it last. Especially when John Nash gets approached for winning the Nobel Prize and some scholarly gentlemen give him their pens. It was emotionally stimulating, especially since we saw him in awe watching another Nobel laureate receive these gifts.As for dealing with the sickness is concerned, I find it substantially real. Russell Crowe does a phenomenal job in bringing his character through various stages of paranoia and confusion when experiencing these delusions, and Jennifer Connelly brings sincerity to her role as his concerned and caring wife. A must-see inspiring masterpiece.",10,1,3,18 July 2008
Iron Man," fun, fun and fun
","Iron Man is a movie of CGI and action. It is entertaining, interesting and to a certain degree, like Batman (except better taken). It's about a rich man , Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) who owns a company that sells weapons used by the USA military. Now, one day, after realizing that Asian terrorists are using his weapons to kill and harass other innocents, he decides to stop making weapons and builds himself a suit, designed to be bullet-proof, emit fire, and send bullets flying through the air. Oh, and it can enable its' user to fly, blasting off like a rocket from the ground. In other words, he decides to become 'Iron Man.' Now he's going to use this to 'make sure the bad guys don't step out of their cave.' Tony Stark designs his own stuff, like Bruce Wayne, and has that air of maturity and sophistication. He's just a bit more funny, chill and less arrogant. Anyways, this movie is a cross between James Bond and Batman, with some iron fun. So watch it if you liked those movies, then you will definitely enjoy it.",9,1,2,18 July 2008
Beowulf," This film is crazy!!!
","What a movie. What a combination of violence, extremely loud sounds and odd characters (like Beowulf himself). To most people, it is an amazing recreation of graphics to entertain audiences who like war movies such as Lord of the Rings. To me it is an utter exposure of flamboyant terror (if that makes sense). I don't know whether it was the fact that I was too weak, or the movie was too strong for people my age (15). Even my sister who is four years my senior, was crouching in her chair with her ears covered by her hands. However, when I came home almost dizzy with those overwhelming special effects, I read in time magazine that it is the tenth best movie of the year. I was surprisedbut I came to some sort of conclusion. It was not the fact that the movie was too violent or too shameful or a disgrace to societyit was the fact that it was advertised the wrong way. People who liked lord of the rings like myself would not necessarily enjoy this overwhelmingly graphical movie. It should in fact be rated 'R' unless a video game freak maybe younger than me who plays games rated 'Mature' (and can handle them) wants to see it. What a strange situation this is",4,0,0,18 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A classic that cannot be remade because of the actors
","This is the first star wars movie that earned ambitious George Lucas an Oscar nomination, and millions of dollars. This was the launch to various sequels , toys, games and defined the star wars mythology like no other. I have to give it to Lucas, the story is amazing. The creativity is awesome, the excitement is average (because the special effects in recent movies have more zest) but nonetheless it will still have it's place in the history of great movies. Luke Skywalker lives with his boring uncle Owen who aspires for Luke to continue the family tradition of being a farmer and to take care of their land when he passes away. But Ben Kenobi, an old 'hermit' opens Luke's eyes for something more adventurous. He helps Luke go on an amazingly stellar journey to rescue a tough princess from the bad but likably powerful Darth Vader. To get there, he meets the cocky but handsome spaceship pilot Han Solo and his hairy buddy Chewy. Also, bringing in the humor are two smart-ass pieces of machinery, C-3P0 and R2D2.",8,1,1,18 July 2008
