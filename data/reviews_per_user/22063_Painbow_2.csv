Come and See," No Mercy
","This is possibly the most disturbing war film ever made. The story of a boy who wants to fight the Nazi machine only to slowly be mentally and even physically destroyed by it. The portrayal of the Nazi invasion is not one that attempts to humanise them as many films have done before.The film is very keen to show the audience the kind of atrocities committed by the Nazi's and the hatred that built up in the Soviet Union. It would of course ultimately lead to the Soviets wreaking terrible revenge on the Germans at a later date.Some may argue that this film is propaganda at it's best and even a means by which to forgive the Soviets their actions once they arrived in Germany after successfully pushing the Nazis back. 'We did this to them because look at what they did to us'. I must admit, it certainly worked on me......i wanted the Russians to annihilate the Germans.....show them no mercy. If this was the films aim or not, i personally believe it is essentially irrelevant. This is a film about war and the impact it has on everyday life.However you interpret the message and however you perceive the apparent propaganda, this film is not easy to forget.

Juno," Very good Indy film
","There are certain things one must expect from the standard Indy film.1. Witty dialogue that doesn't exist in real life 2. Quirky people who seem slightly retarded but are in fact just unique 3. Some maudlin studenty music five seconds after every piece of dialogue 4. A happy ending that pretends to be an ambiguous ending 5. A liberal outlook on life 6. Actors who want to be in Indy movies coz they're quirky and it looks good on the C.V 7. Some maudlin studenty music five seconds after every single, god damn piece of dialogueThis film ticks every box and i must say i thoroughly enjoyed it. It's escapist nonsense of the best kind and is only rivalled by the likes of X Men or Terminator. If you want a realistic film with profound things to say then skip this. If you want T2 style escapist entertainment that will wash over you then this is perfect",7,4,10,6 July 2008
