The Avengers," Too long
","It's not a bad movie. In true I enjoyed it, but it could be little bit shorter and not so pathetic. More than two hours it was too long for me, and also my friends, and in the middle of the movie there was too little action like on action movie. Killing agent Phil and his good bye speech was so cheap, so predictable, it's one big fake. And not so smart agent Hill also wasn't fun at all. OK, Mr. Downey was perfect and Hulk's beating s*it out of Loki was just marvelous, but I hoped more from this movie- not another we are so patriotic and boring superheroes movie. Oh and making it 3D- what for? 'Cause every movie from 'Avatar' must be 3D now? Even when there really not so many 3D scenes. as I said it's not bad, but I think, it's only for Marvel's fans.",5,3,10,13 May 2012
Jurassic World," There is a plus...
","... and it's dinosaurs. Absolutely everything else is a big pile of crap (might be dinosaurs'). So full of clich√©s, you exactly know, who is going to die or who will live just a few minutes after knowing the character. So many absurd decisions, so many stupid but predictable actions. So much staring on danger in spite of running out. So many substantive errors for anyone who has primary science knowledge. And last but not least running many hours in the jungle on heels without absolutely any problems. Unfortunately dinosaurs haven't eaten everyone so it's going to be another idiotic movie.",2,69,87,29 October 2017
