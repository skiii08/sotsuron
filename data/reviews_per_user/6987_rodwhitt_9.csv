First Man," Chazelle and Gosling round 2
","If you're going into First Man wanting to see a cool story about the Apollo 11 moon landing, you will be disappointed in this film.
This is a brilliant, almost documentary style film about the life of Neil Armstrong. He experienced a lot of tragedy, which evolved him into a quiet man who chooses to keep his emotions bottled up, rather than opening up with friends and/or family.
Ryan Gosling displays this with subtle acting in his dialog and emotions and the outcome is incredible to see.
Gosling's terrific performance, along with Chazelle's remarkable eye behind the camera (as expected), makes for a very good film that you can expect to see nominated this Oscar season.",8,1,3,27 October 2018
Hereditary," Arthouse, yet mainstream
","Hereditary was twisted in the best of ways. A slow burning Arthouse style of tension that screen junkies love , with some mainstream horror bumps in the night for the average movie goer. LOVED IT!",10,23,47,15 June 2018
A Star Is Born," A breathtaking tale of love and struggle
","A Star is Born was a wonderful journey to follow with its characters. Bradley Cooper gives the best performance of his career, and delivers a movie directed so well it's hard to believe this is his debut as a director. Lady Gaga was just a HAIR less impressive than Cooper, but she was unbelievably great. Every moment from the fun moments to the dark moments audiences will be glued to the screen and excited to see what happens next.
And all the music is original and incredible.
This film also takes a very real and eye opening take on addiction that feels more real and even more genuine than other films do when they contain some sort of addiction.
A Star is Born is a must see, and quite possibly my favorite movie of 2018 so far.",10,9,18,12 November 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Dark, yet warm
","Three Bilboards, with a fairly short running time, throws the audience directly into the plot with the opening frames. This film does an excellent job showing both sides, McDormand's character and the general public, equally as they are. A grieving mother seeking justice and answers, and the Chief of Police who feels he's done his job to the best of his ability. McDormand's blunt, rude, vulgar, and uncensored character is extremely charismatic. The other characters (one in particular after some major character development) are very charismatic as well. This film takes the audience on a very dark journey where nothing 'expected' or 'predictable' really happens. We become very invested in a brilliant story with direction we are fools to think we can foresee. Viewers will feel a surprising warmth to this dark tale, and find the very shocking (and very common) inappropriate dialog either funny, or just plain wrong. The brilliant storytelling and extraordinary performances make Three Billboards a must see for all audiences.

Baby Driver," Must see
","Baby Driver comes through in the clutch, proving that fast paced action can be brilliantly achieved, not with shaky camera sequences, but with masterful directing and editing. With the help of great visual storytelling, stellar performances, and a killer soundtrack, Baby Driver races to the top without looking back. Other than a fairly rushed love interest, Baby Driver is seemingly flawless. So buckle up, crank up the stereo, and slam your eyes and ears into gear for yet another Edgar Wright masterpiece. 95/100-Baby23",10,1,4,10 October 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Wow ALL that just happened, and somehow I'm only slightly overwhelmed
","Infinity War is a jam packed movie with tons of action and story balanced for a nonstop Marvel experience like never seen before. Infinity War managed to cram a solid story, countless characters meshing together, and fun action all in one film that should have been 4 hours long to fit everything in. Seeing the Guardians finally interact with Avengers characters is one of the most satisfying elements of Infinity War. 
My only flaw WOULD BE that soooo much is jammed into this film. However, the Russo brothers managed to pull it off as effectively as anyone could. The Jam packed film worked and didn't feel like 'too much' as much as it would if anyone else had Done a film like this. Loved it, go see this!",10,1,5,13 May 2018
A Quiet Place," *whispers* 'wow'
","A Quiet Place was unlike any movie I have ever seen. Krasinski has shown his creativity and skill behind the camera and screenplay. There were moments where I found myself tensing up at the slightest noise in fear of the creatures who attack the noise, and simply because the film was purposely done in a way where the smallest noise seems like a shriek to the audience. 
I have ZERO flaws with this movie, other than the gentleman in the theater behind me eating what sounded like rocks. 
Do yourself and everyone else a favor and DO NOT eat during this movie.",10,3,5,17 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Risky, but rewarding
","Last Jedi was wonderful for everyone who didn't take a deep dive into theories on the origin of characters. Phasma, Snoke, and Rey's parents didn't have significance to them like fans had hoped. Johnson took the risk by not making everyone 'someone' in the Star Wars universe. But Phasma is no different from beloved Boba Fett. Rey's parents are no different than Anakin's parents. Star Wars fans have recently bathed themselves into the idea every character needs to somehow be connected to another to be significant. 
If you don't feel that way and love seeing the story unfold, Last Jedi will be a film you'll watch over and over. Also, Johnson has taken the powers of the Force to a new level , past just mind tricks and moving rocks. With the Force, users are capable of much more than we ever expected. Stop watching YouTube theory videos, and you can't have much to complain about with this fun and gorgeous movie",9,2,24,7 April 2018
Creed II," Predictable, but with a bigger heart and everything you want in a Rocky film
","While this film is the eighth in the Rocky franchise, it is very predictable from start to finish. It is hard for the eighth film to do something completely different in a loved franchise and end up like...you know, Rocky 5. So this movie has a very modern take on what made the original Rocky's so beloved. Stallone also gives one of my favorite performances as Rocky, and Michael B. Jordan continues to impress on the screen.
What stands out about this movie the most is how much it focuses on family and loved ones. Creed II has arguably the biggest of all of the movies prior.
With everything fans love about the Rocky films, and the biggest heart of the franchise, Creed II is easily one of the best movies of the franchise, top 3 at least.",9,14,25,22 November 2018
