The Devil's Advocate," Hallucinating fundamentalists?
","Am I the only one who thinks that this is a movie about a bunch of small town Christian fundamentalists who come to New York just to find themselves having hallucinations in which they see demons in everyone and everything (including such benign things as clouds and weather changes)?And finally they encounter the devil himself who has a rather bizarre idea of how to produce the anti-christ - by having two of his many children (who are only half-brothers and half-sisters, of course) mate? Whereas, one might argue, there have already been plenty anti-christs, i.e. all his existing children (and if there were so many, why was Lomax character so important to him?). Just to point out one flaw in the 'logic' of this movie.The single most annoying moment was when the devil called himself a 'humanist' thus playing to some Christian fundamentalists' equating humanism with satanism. He did have a point, though, as far as his criticism of God is concerned.Apart from all that, I didn't like the fact that Pacino playing the devil was kind of implied by the title of the movie and by one-line summaries of the movie, but was not actually something the movie itself showed conclusively. After all Lomax's wife could have just had hallucinations when she saw people turn into demons. And the whole New York episode a dream. I suppose the ending implies that the movie really does believe in the devil. Fortunately, I do not.",Null,0,0,7 May 2000
