Antz," Who thought animating films for adults was a good idea?
","_Antz_ is the latest in a misbegotten trend of trying to graft adult content onto animated family films.  Blame _The Lion King_ (and guiding hand for both films, Jeffrey Katzenberg) for doing it well and reaping the financial rewards, but successors reaching for the same brass ring (both within Disney -- _Hunchback_, e.g. -- and without) go too far.  Not only is the language in _Antz_ a tad inappropriate (do you really want to explain 'erotic fantasy' to your five-year-old?), the use of Woody Allen as the voice of the hero along with battle and flood imagery reminiscent of other DreamWorks films like _Saving Private Ryan_ and _Deep Impact_ only reinforces the sense that _Antz_ is aspiring to be something perverse:  a gritty, neurotic, philosophical disaster movie for the whole family.But the worst offense of all is that the film is boring.  The script is as trite as they come, moving as it does from one movie cliche to the next without stopping for real character development.  The dialogue is surprisingly witless and plodding, with every joke telegraphed well in advance.  The songs -- admittedly a frequent bane of Disney films as well -- are of even less interest here as they are 'standards' tossed in for no apparent reason.  And the film is visually dull as well -- all dark and dingy in the ant colony where most of the action takes place, but hardly more beautiful in the great outdoors._Antz_ may represent another leap forward in the art of computer animation, but I found the short trailer I saw for _A Bug's Life_ to contain much more life, color, whimsy and invention than the entirety of this disappointing affair.",5,6,12,26 November 1998
Chicken Run," The latest dazzling animation to support a weak story
","Being a fan of animated features, I went to Chicken Run full of anticipation, what with all the positive reviews and the high esteem bestowed upon the film's creators (whose Wallace and Gromit shorts I've never seen).But instead of a charming, witty, light-hearted fable, I got a leaden, trite, obvious trifle.  It doesn't take 10 seconds of heavy-booted footsteps to figure out a character is evil, but that's how this story is told.  And someone should advise the scriptwriters that a joke you can guess in advance ('beautiful chicks') is not funny.Sure, the animation is amazing.  A lot of animated features these days are visually amazing.  But a good animated film needs a good story with characters you care about to make all that painstaking effort worthwhile. Sadly, Chicken Run doesn't have one.",2,2,7,18 July 2000
The Polar Express," God-awful tedium
","There are so many things wrong with THE POLAR EXPRESS, it's hard to know where to begin. First, it barely has a plot, not surprising for a film based on a thin children's book perhaps (though see SHREK for an amazing counterexample), but this leaves the state-of-the-art CG motion capture technology to do the heavy lifting, never a good sign.And what does that technology produce? A main character so lacking in appeal that it's hard to care what happens to him. A series of train-in-peril scenes as old as film itself. A North Pole of endless factory-style red brick buildings with piped-in generic Christmas music that is the polar opposite of enchanting. A sea of elves greeting Santa that creepily evokes TRIUMPH OF THE WILL. A chance for its star to voice multiple roles, which leads to Tom Hanks fatigue.Support from the score includes some 'original,' forgotten-before-they-finish Christmas dirges. And to maintain the CG tradition, there is a pop-culture reference gratuitously squeezed in near the end of the film (not counting the director's earlier homage to himself and FORREST GUMP's feather).There's probably nothing wrong with the technology that a good script couldn't cure, but without one, you're left watching a train wreck.",2,4,10,11 November 2004
The Incredibles," An overpraised but credible pastiche
","Most Pixar films get good reviews from the critics, but they seem to be falling all over themselves for THE INCREDIBLES. I'm not sure why.First off, the film strikes me as a pastiche of the Saturday morning cartoons I grew up watching, like THE FANTASTIC FOUR and JONNY QUEST, with a little James Bond thrown in. As such, it seems designed to appeal most to 10- to 14-year-old boys, a group that may be reluctant to go to an animated movie; witness the anemic box office of TITAN A.E. or TREASURE PLANET for proof.By and large, the story is played straight. There are a few laughs scattered here and there, but the tone is nothing like the mixture of humor and pathos Pixar established for the medium with TOY STORY and Dreamworks exaggerated ad nauseam in SHREK 2.Perhaps that's what the critics find appealing. THE INCREDIBLES is certainly not like any other animated film I've seen; at times, it's easy to forget that it *is* animated. Some of that is due to the ever-growing artistry of the Pixar team, which often makes you feel like you're watching a comic book/video game come to life.But as solid as the movie is -- and except for a slow start, I was not bored -- for me, it's missing that little bit of magic to take it to the next level, where millions have found Shrek and Nemo.",8,9,18,5 November 2004
Shrek 2," Typical sequel
","I don't know why SHREK 2 is so popular.  It has none of the originality of the first SHREK -- or FINDING NEMO or THE LION KING or MONSTERS, INC., all of which it may very well surpass in box office revenue.  Shrek is no longer an ogre (ashamed to admit he lives in the swamp?!), Donkey is no longer an ass (his lovability is assumed), character motivation is dispensed with (Fiona bears no ill will toward her parents for isolating her in a tower?!), and what some here call 'satire' is about as pointed as a hairball (Far Far Away is like Hollywood, get it?).The first SHREK immediately charmed with its unexpected joy in the grossness of an ogre's life, and it sustained a compelling emotional tenor about how such a one who repels others can ever find true happiness.  The resolution to that dilemma was surprising and gratifying. SHREK 2 lacks any emotional resonance and simply re-uses pre-sold characters to put over obvious jokes.  It's not totally dismal -- some of the jokes and new characters are intermittently amusing -- but it's hardly enchanting.  If the filmmakers want to create a sequel that is worth imitating instead of just a series of imitations, they should take a good, hard look at TOY STORY 2 before they start on SHREK 3.As an aside, I agree with the poster who deemed BROTHER BEAR the best animated film of the past year and disagree with another's assessment that DreamWorks can now go toe-to- toe with Disney/Pixar.  One franchise does not a dynasty make.",7,0,0,30 May 2004
A Bug's Life," Pleasant, visually stunning
","_A Bug's Life_ is the cheerier, prettier and ultimately more successful of this year's two animated insect films, but it suffers a bit from a dull yet frenetic story that takes no time to let its characters breathe and a script only moderately witty.  As others have noted, the closing credits are by far the best part.  Too bad the rest of the film is not as sharp and clever. Still, the Disney animated standard of 'never less than good' is upheld.  I sure would like to see 'great' again, though.",7,1,1,10 December 1998
