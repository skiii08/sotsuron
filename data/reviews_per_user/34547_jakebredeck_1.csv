The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," 2 Hours with little to no plot
","This movie, as indicated in the summary, did not have a plot. When saying this, I am aware that the movie was produced from the first half of a novel, and is expected to omit the climax of the novel which will come in part 2, but this motion picture was simply boring. From the very beginning, the film features slow cuts and a plethora of dialogue that nearly lulled me to sleep on a weekend night. In contrast to its prior two films in the series, Mockingjay had no combat, no conflict, and effectively nothing to do with the Hunger games.For two hours, I watched Katniss walk around a deserted area completely desecrated from warfare, while she was filmed with the hope that she would say something inspirational. It was on par with a documentary of the world's worst group of advertisers attempting to shoot a commercial. At one point a child risked her life to save a cat, and the antagonist rained white roses around a building he destroyed after an hour and forty minutes of nothing. To top it off, the movie ends with the main characters boyfriend trying to strangle her, with absolutely no resolution. It is clear to me that the developers of this film failed to recognize that a single novel has a fully developed plot, but taking the first half of it and creating a film, leaves out half the plot. My advice is to wait a year, and watch the two movies together when part 2 is released, because this one alone is a giant waste of time.",3,26,37,30 November 2014
