The Expendables 2," Excellent movie - terrible cinema
","Well, what I passionately hate is when people post comments on Amazon for example and downgrade the product because it was not delivered on time. I will rate the movie and not the experience which was absolutely terrible. This is 21st century and I am sitting in an Empire cinema in one of London's suburbs and the damn chair is held together by duct tape so that it doesn't fall apart. Then there is picture quality. You know what, I challenge you to download a pirated version of that movie with picture quality as terrible as that. What the hell is Empire doing, saving on projector bulbs? If that is the case, why would I not simply download a pirated version of the movie, sit at home in comfort of my sofa and save myself price of the ticket. Empire - you should be ashamed of yourself!!!Now the movie ... I was not looking forward to it as sequel hardly ever lives up to all expectation but this one did. It was just great to see them all in one place. Chuck was just incredible and I wish that Dolph Lundgren had longer appearance. Jokes were funny and spot on and to see Arnie back in action was just awesome. I am so glad that now that he is out of politics we will see more and more of him. One actor I would love to have seen is Steven Seagal but he is not on talking terms with Van Damme so I guess no can do. To me Jason stole the show. Fighting scenes were just superb, I loved it! Excellent movie, shame about disgraceful viewing experience. Bring on the third one !!! ( I will download this one )",8,1,4,27 August 2012
Underworld Awakening," Could have been better
","I saw in 'Real 3D' and to be honest it was pretty good but it could have been so much better. The emphasis was more on special effects not the story but somehow they managed to pull it of. I expected so much more from Eve 'who has more power than all of us together'. What power, I hardly saw any. I was terribly disappointed that Bill Nighy was not in it. Yes I know, Victor lost half of his head and all that but if Sigourney could have been cloned from a drop of blood in Alien III then why not Victor? Bill was for me what made Underworld so great, shame he was not part of the latest instalment. For me personally Underworld does not work that well in well lit urban areas as the edge gets taken away which is why I loved Underworld Evolution. Overall, a very good effort. Looking forward to next instalment and for the love of God bring Victor back.",8,3,5,23 January 2012
