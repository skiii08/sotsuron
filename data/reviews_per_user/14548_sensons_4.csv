The New World," Very Very boring and very very slow zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
","2 Hrs and 15 minutes of slow sleepy music and awful acting. Collin Farrel shows that Alexander wasn't his low point , but with this dragon of a movie he really hits bottom. The whole'new world' has nothing to do with the 'new world'but is the maybe 900th movie about Romeo and Julia. After 20 minutes i realized that their was a wonder happening . The native American girl spoke and understood English in a sec , while the story was that she never met 'white men'before.But for the use of all the one liners she would speak it was probably needed to speak English????????????????? The new word title was just taken to let people believe that the movie would tell something about the exploring of America . The only thing it tells is the same old love story as always and even worse and slower then ever before. Don't spend any time or money on this peace of crap.",1,1,7,5 May 2006
Hostel," Very Dumb and Very Bad
","Probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Very bad acting and a script that looks like to been written by a loner who never has been out of his state or country. Amsterdam is as you should believe the movie a hellhole where everybody smokes dope and speaks German.hahahahaha. The name for hotel in dutch is HOTEL so why there's a sign outside an amsterdam street that says hostel i dunno , and really after seen all that crap i realized it was a waste of time to look a second more to this dumb and very amateuristic made thing. U might ask yourself who in the hell produces a Z movie like this. Send the scriptwriter and the director to europe for a year or 5 so they really know what they are talking about. HOSTEL is an attack on people's intelligence.",1,1,2,13 March 2006
Cloverfield," Terrible, childish crap
","If this is the way the movie-world will go , i wish them all the luck . What a piece of crap, cheap Charley's , all made by 'handheld camera's'?? Is that an excuse fore lame filming??? shaking like the worst amateur-movie i have ever seen. Terrible acting and ridiculous 'special effects' A real head-ache movie , don't spend any money on this !!!!!!! SF movies from the 50s are better then this. A monster movie really, but not how they meant it to be i guess. i wonder what you have to smoke before you like this. A total waste of time and recourses (not on camera's though)Plugged like it was 'indepedence day' its a BIG disappointment.",1,1,4,6 February 2008
Downfall," A Good European movie about a horrible part of history
","I have seen The Bunker(1981) , the same story with Anthony Hopkins as Hitler , that was a great movie.The Downfall is even better, it really was good to see that the European director had a complete different way of filming . For example in American made movies there can not be enough bloody scenes , but a naked breast or thigh is almost a crime so the reality in American movies stops at the love scenes , then it looks like people make love with as much close on as they can, that always makes me laugh , if you don't want to show sex then don't do it at all but don't show it that way. The German director of Downfall makes the movie the European way, no need to show executions 50 times he just leaves that part to the imagination of the viewers and thats in a movie as downfall a good thing .The few love scenes are normally filmed so it looks real for a change. Good actors, good filmed , i give it a 9 out of 10",10,1,4,16 April 2005
