Resident Evil: Afterlife," Better than expected!
","Surprisingly, Resident Evil: Afterlife appears to be thus far the best action movie of 2010. Possibly because I wasn't expecting much after the blatant Matrix rip-off-fest that was the trailer.There is an actual storyline (I won't spoil it for anyone) which isn't half bad... and that's saying a lot for an action movie!!! Typically, I don't expect anything when going to watch an action movie, so take this into consideration when raising an eyebrow at my 'not half bad' comment.Cast-wise; no complaints whatsoever. Then again, not many guys would complain when the cast includes Milla Jovovich and throws in Ali Larter. Wentworth Miller showing up in the context of the movie made me /facepalm while I heard whispers of 'Prison Break' and sniggering from various other movie-goers around me.Action; this is where the Resident Evil franchise has always been top-notch and it doesn't disappoint this time either.Overall, I'd give it a 6/10. Minus 1 point for stretching the Resident Evil movies just a little too much...",6,7,23,10 September 2010
The Expendables," An action flick lacking action?
","Story: Somewhat sub-par plot that was almost entirely illogical. Seemed to wander about aimlessly to me... and a friend who was watching it with me managed to fall asleep. I'd average it at 2/10 - it would actually be 1/10 but I gave it an extra 1 point because I never really expect an action flick to have much of a story anyway.Action: Err... for an action flick, there was an odd lack of action and way too much talking; especially from Mickey Rourke. Even the bits that did have action were disappointing to me - except for the opening scene which gave me high hopes and then proceeded to sink like a stone. 4/10.Overall: 3/10... Props for having a cameo by Willis and the Governator... If anybody asks, I'd tell them to not bother going to the cinema and just rent the Expendables off Netflix or whatever DVD rental company you prefer whenever it does go to DVD.",3,31,62,14 August 2010
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Big shoes to fill...
","Overall, AoU was a good film... but given the last 2 Marvel movies that were released, the problem is that the expectations have grown tremendously. I thought CA:TWS and GOTG were absolutely incredible, and so, came into the cinema with possibly slightly inflated expectations. AoU delivered on most of those expectations... Here's 2 things that I thought let it down:1) New characters - Not enough in terms of character development. There were far too many existing characters/new ones/returning ones bouncing around and time limitations (and this isn't a short movie either) basically meant that none of the new characters got developed enough... not even Ultron (IMO). It almost felt like they decided to throw in a paragraph for each new character and call it a day. 2) End Battle - Without giving away anything, I thought the final battle didn't feel like one. Something seemed lacking in terms of build up and peak... and as such it ended up feeling more like a large speed bump rather than a roller coaster. Don't get me wrong though, as I mentioned earlier, everything else I expected out of an Avengers movie had its box ticked... I still enjoyed the movie. Just not as much as I would have if the 2 issues above were ironed out... It almost felt like Joss tried to do accomplish too much with this single movie; create Avengers movie, add new villain, add new characters (a bunch), add tie-ins, add forward links to next movies, etc. That said, I'm still excited to see what's next for Marvel.",8,21,44,22 April 2015
