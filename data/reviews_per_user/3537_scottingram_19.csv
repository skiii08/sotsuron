Hidden Figures," Hidden Figures Film Review
","The new drama film Hidden Figures based on a true story about NASA and black women who revolutionised things for space astronauts starring Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monáe, Taraji P. Henson. In Hidden Figures an uplifting true-life drama about the African-American women who played a key role in US space missions. It's 1962 and the space race is on. NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is determined to beat the Russians in putting a man into orbit around the Earth. But behind the scenes, a trio of pioneering African-American women are responsible for the calculations that will launch John Glenn (American actor Glen Powell - The Expendables 3, Ride Along 2) into space. These 'human computers' have to battle against deeply engrained racism and sexism to secure their place in history. Katherine G. Johnson (American actress Taraji P. Henson - The Karate Kid 2010, Date Night) is a brilliant maths prodigy. Team supervisor Dorothy Vaughn (American actress Octavia Spencer - Get On Up: The James Brown Story, Divergent films) is kept in her place by a condescending boss Mrs Vivian Mitchell (American actress Kirsten Dunst - Spider-Man films, Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles). And Mary Jackson (American actress Janelle Monáe - Moonlight) endures an uphill struggle to train as NASA's first black female engineer. From the director of 'St. Vincent', this is an inspirational, feelgood true story of unsung heroes who dared to dream big and refused to be intimidated by the obstacles placed in their way.
