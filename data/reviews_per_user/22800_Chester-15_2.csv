The Blair Witch Project," The damn good PR job for a crappy(not scary)movie
",DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME TO SEE THIS FILM!!!!!I have seen many crappy movies in my 30 plus years but I have never left the theater as angry and nauseated as this movie.  I could have made this movie.Buy a CHEAP video camera with no steady shot.  Know nothing about basic Cinematography and get lost in the woods.  The camera work would be bad for family's home 8mm movie.  The camera work in this film is nothing more than jerky and sudden movements enough to make astronaught sick to their stomach.The premise of the movie is stupid.  Maybe I am a city boy but why would anybody with half a brain go hiking in a remote forest that they have never been in.  Then you have an idiot who throws away the map of an area no one has ever been.  Of course then they are hunted by a Friday the 13th style killer that is a town folk hero or villain depending on your opinion of the characters in this movie.The girl a pretentious and anoying personThe sound guy a loud and stupid know nothing.  (Scream Queen of this movie)Finally you have emotionally unbalanced camera man that is as important as a red shirt in the old Star Trek series.I went to see this movie with 3 other people who had similar opinions.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME TO SEE THIS WASTE OF FILM!!!,Null,0,0,10 August 1999
Gladiator," The best movie I have seen since Braveheart
","I see many movies most of them I either don't like or forget what the story was about a week after I see it.  This was something special.  In an era where studios spend 100 million on special effects and actor's salaries and 5 bucks writing the script  this film has great balance of story, action, romance, all the elements that make a story great.The 2 1/2 hours this movie goes for just flies by.  If you are one of those people who look for historical accuracy, you will not get it from this picture.  The opening seen looked like the beginning of Desert Storm on CNN. But anyhow great picture!  If the Academy does not look at this picture come awards time there is something wrong.",Null,0,0,7 June 2000
