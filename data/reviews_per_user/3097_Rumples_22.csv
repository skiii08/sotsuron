Antz," Stunning movie - no. Brilliant animation - yes.
","A fun movie that entertained all the way through, but not a brilliant or original story. Strong moral tale really that addressed the possibly competing notions of individualism with community responsibility. Not to mention the whole hero's quest - common ant makes good aspect. Voices were chosen to fit the stereotypes, nothing really wrong with that, except the voices were SO well known it may be difficult to divorce character from voice. Stunning animation, but simply because it is a cartoon does not automatically mean it is appropriate for children (although I think it certainly is for slightly older kids - they could do with a dose of anti-authoritarianism/fascism). Worth the price of a ticket (even in the inflated movie price land of Aus.). In all, an enjoyable piece and well crafted, if a mite predictable and trite.",7,0,0,10 November 1998
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What a joke!
","This movie is a complete farce from beginning to end and is only exceeded by the hype and the ridiculous score it's currently running at on the IMDB! There are only two redeeming features in this film - the audio and visual effects. Everything else is ordinary in the extreme. From the cardboard acting to the dull dialogue to the predictable, stolen, pointless story-line. To say that this is simply a kid's movie is both nonsensical and false. It sells out the legions of fans who have kept Star Wars alive for the last two decades and fails to provide an excuse for the lack of quality film-making. I won't even begin to discuss the numerous obvious rip-offs of other well known movies but if you missed the obvious thievery for Ben Hur you must be mindless. Even still, everyone must have noted the similarities to Ep. 4! If I ever build any type of large spaceship someone please, I beg of you, remind me to provide a little more than token protection of the core! I can't say that this was a bad movie, it simply was not a good one. My vote 6/10",6,0,1,14 June 1999
Mulan," Weak, corny, predictable, etc etc etc
","Never having been a fan of Disney movies I was reluctant to rent this one however my wife was keen and I was somewhat reassured by the rating it had gotten on IMDB! Now I feel somewhat ripped off by my fellow IMDB-ers for misleading me so. This film is horrible and is an insult to a noble Chinese legend. Mulan as a Valley-girl!?! Mushu is nothing but a constant annoyance. The music is alternately bland and inappropriate, the dialogue incongruous, the slapstick un-funny, and the plot transparent. Now I am not a child and did not watch this with a child, but I don't think that it would have improved the experience if I had. Better avoid this one, 5/10",5,3,15,9 May 1999
The Big Lebowski," Gotta love those Coens
","This is a fun, clever movie from a team that specialises in the intelligent, quirky type of film. Great performances, interesting characters, witty dialogue, and a suitably bizarre plot all add up to make this a very good movie. (But I preferred Fargo if it comes right down to it) 8/10",8,0,1,2 May 1999
Amistad," Classy 'historical' movie
","I was impressed with this movie for a number of reasons, the cast, the story, and the underlying themes to name a few. I must say I was not aware that it was a Spielberg show until the end credits and was a bit surprised, however the themes are true Spielberg and, as has been mentioned before, parallels are bound to be drawn with other films like 'Schindler's List'. History - much has been said about historical inaccuracies. While I understand this disappointment, in the end this is a movie - entertainment - and some licence is bound to be taken. But if we are considering what the movie is not, I wonder if the reaction would have been the same if the 'baddies' had not been foreign males. How about a slave uprising on a plantation with white, genteel, American planters and women? The common cry of freedom echoes strongly for blacks/African Americans, Jews, and other minorities in a country tht was supposedly based on tolerance and liberty, but has a long and 'proud' history of intolerance and oppression. In the end, this is a stylish movie with a moving theme, and well packaged and delivered. Worth watching, 7/10",7,0,2,6 December 1998
Blade," One of the better comic adaptations
","Blade is violent, unpleasant, cliched and even a bit corny. But it is still a fairly entertaining movie and a classy action/horror film. Yes the script is flimsy and the storyline a tad unlikely but that doesn't stop this film from being interesting. I felt that it started out quite strongly, not being familiar with the comic I was intrigued at the possibilities, but faded badly at the end. Anyways, don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. But if you're prone to queasiness and don't like the latent sexuality behind all that biting, sucking and blood, give Blade a miss. My vote 6/10",6,0,1,23 May 1999
That Thing You Do!," I don't want to gush but...
","This is really a great movie, no question. I rarely watch a film that is so skilfully crafted and yet is completely inoffensive to any segment of society. The movie combines comedy (and some parts are definitely funny) with romance in a tender-hearted tale of friendship and growing up. I simply cannot recommend this movie highly enough except to say that this is a film I could watch multiple times. Brilliantly acted by a still maturing cast ensemble, witty dialogue, it's got it all. If you want to see something that with touch you and give you a buzz but you don't want to be assailed by profanity, violence, or sexuality - That Thing You Do! is the movie for you. Another Hanks triumph, not just for his role in the movie but for putting it all together.  8/10",8,5,6,10 January 1999
Empire of the Sun," So good it's scary
","This movie is, without question, an absolute masterpiece. It is literally so good that some scenes transport you into the mind of Jamie/Jim in another time and place. I simply cannot say enough good about this film. Christian Bale was simply magnificent. If you have not seen this movie, or haven't for some time, go and watch it. You will be moved like films rarely do. It is easily in my top 5 movies of all time. This is a 'must see' movie. My vote 9/10",9,0,2,7 February 1999
Notting Hill," Cute, simple, harmless, unchallenging, unremarkable
","This film is nice and moderately pleasant. It allows Hugh Grant to act like Hugh Grant (almost intolerable for my liking), and trots out the old boy meets girl, loses girl, gets girl back, routine in a pleasant way for such a well-worn formula. The supporting cast is fairly good but is really only there for cheap laughs or a bit of sympathy. Julia Roberts is tolerable and the situation passingly interesting (every man's fantasy really) but just didn't do much for me. Part of the problem may have been that I'd just been to see 'Life is Beautiful' the evening before and this just pales into insignificance in comparison. Undoubtedly most of the viewing public will enjoy this because it does nothing more than deliver some low-brow chuckles and soppy sentiment - a perfect recipe for success today it seems. In any case, I'd suggest you at least leave it for video. My vote 6/10 (and a dang sight more realistic that the 7.9 or so its currently running at).",6,0,0,21 June 1999
Armageddon," Only in America
","Could they make something this bad, spin it out for way too long, then try to pass it off as a movie. This 'action blockbuster' was so poor as to almost make me cringe. It was predictable, dull, trite, and corny. That is not to say that I couldn't see ANYBODY enjoying it - there are some impressive explosions and a few interestingly done effects - but if you want a picture that requires more of its audience than a Tom and Jerry cartoon, look elsewhere. 5/10",5,0,1,2 May 1999
Dark City," Very aptly titled
","A sharp, clever, brooding movie that is stunningly filmed and intelligently crafted. No doubt this film makes an impact. The glorious visuals are almost enough to do that by themselves, but its there bizarre, twisted story-line that really snares the viewer. Yes, there are a few areas that disappoint (the final conflict with the strangers - hurling tune-thoughts at each other) with their trite-ness, but there's real quality here. A talented cast, particularly the ever-lovely Jennifer Connelly and the cerebral Hurt, top off this very good film. If you want something a bit dark but very good and clever, this could well be the movie for you. 7/10",7,0,1,19 April 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Probably the best movie of the year
","Firstly, I'm impressed at how many Australians have commented here on what is clearly a very American movie in attitude and content. Secondly, anyone who says this is easily the best movie they've ever watched needs to watch more movies. That said, this is an exceptionally well made film and definitely worth seeing. The criticisms I have with the movie don't nearly outweigh its finer qualities. Too many criicisms focus on what a movie isn't (and should be?) rather than what it is. This movie attempts to provide some insight into the horrors of war, without straying too far from the standard war-fare (cute pun). I also felt a touch of the Cameron-esque (chiefly in the unnecessary use of the flash-back but other things too). The 'hooray for America' line that is so common is trundled out again, the only reference to the rest of the Allies is criticism. I was impressed 'though that Spielberg didn't try to suggest that American soldiers were flawless saviours. The execution of prisoners was an important part of this. The comments of others seem to suggest some tenuous holds on reality. The camera work in the battle scenes could be jerky, but I thought it was effective and didn't last too long. The bloodshed was unpleasant and realistic, but not real. If this movie made people a little more educated about how horrific war really is, how chaotic and terrifying, all the better. I am not sure 'though that some glory did not attach itself to Miller's team and their deaths. Lastly, I was impressed that, although this was a long movie, it didn't feel it at all. It held my attention the whole time. Anyway, enough already. Very good movie, 8/10 (9 being my highest - no such thing as a 10 in art). Definitely worth the price of a ticket, even in the home of costly movie tickets.",8,0,0,29 November 1998
Good Will Hunting," Close, but no cigar
","Good Will Hunting is a good movie, no question. It is a long way, however, from a great movie. As I watched the film I honestly enjoyed it and found it credibly done, but as I came away, I had a lingering sense that I had been duped. This movie is not worth all the hoopla (and awards) it garnered, something I can only attribute to Ben and Matt's 'fresh' faces. The story is a long way from original, following fairly predictable routes, some scenes badly expose the immaturity of the writers. Once again, a good movie, not a great movie.",7,1,3,5 August 1998
Life Is Beautiful," Absolutely amazing, one of my all-time favorites
","This movie is simply brilliant. Casting aside all of the trappings of modern movie-making (special effects, brain-jarring sound, big name stars, bizarre plots and settings, language sex and big explosions) it produces instead a film which captivates audiences because of its simplicity, classy acting and the sheer beauty of its tale. In what may well be the hallmark of a great movie, opinions of LIB are markedly polarised - the number of '1' votes are about equal to the range of 2-6, strongly illustrating that it is difficult to be indifferent to this movie. This is a major difference between LIB and most of what Hollywood churns out where indifference is the only acceptable response. It saddens me that so many people have failed to recognise the charm of this film by choosing to take offence at the way in which the Holocaust was portrayed. I am not Jewish (or Romany, Eastern European, handicapped etc) and would not attempt to presume to tell any of these groups how to react to this portrayal but I can say that I was more moved, more hurt by man's inhumanity towards man, by LIB than I was by Schindler's List or any other Holocaust movie or doco. I, like many others, came out of this film wanting all my friends to go see it. The sub-titles in no way detract from the experience, in fact they are hardly noticeable after a little while. My vote 9/10.",9,4,7,21 June 1999
Groundhog Day," Very clever movie
","As has already been said several times, this movie is good. It is so good that it manages to be thought-provoking at the same time as it is humourous. Memorable performances from the cast (I'm a bit ambivalent about Andie McDowell) tied with a witty script and clever directing lift this fascinating premise to a very watchable film. So watchable that I and many others feel they could watch this movie again and again (although only on free-to-air ;)Good film, definitely worth a watch. 8/10",8,0,0,11 May 1999
Pulp Fiction," Some good, some bad
","Firstly I should say that I saw the sanitised for tv version - I don't watch 'R' rated movies and this was 'R' rated even here in Australia. This obviously means that the film was not entirely as the director intended it to be. I must say 'though that, while this film has many interesting features, some classy acting and the occasional witty repartee', it is in my opinion on the whole nothing more than a crude and juvenile attempt to shock and offend the majority of the movie watching population. Being visually and verbally assaulted by film may well make for a memorable cinematic experience but doesn't necessarily make for a good film. But it isn't so much the action itself as much as the language which achieves this - and most of the profanities (and I include the all too frequent use of n****r in this list) were unnecessary - I tend to side with Spike Lee on this issue, QT is never gonna be a black man no matter how hard he might try. And while this movie is offensive and far from original, it has some very clever aspects and shows some of the directorial class QT clearly has (although no real acting ability - his cameo was a big mistake). In all I ended up with rather mixed feelings about this movie. My vote 7/10",7,1,2,8 June 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Very clever film
","There is no question that this movie combines witty dialogue with an intriguing plot, interesting characters, and sharp direction. Many people will find the violence and language (and maybe the brief nudity) unacceptable, but these things were not completely gratuitous. Many may find the dialogue difficult to follow and still others - the intellectually challenged - will have trouble following the plot. For them I am sorry because they are going to miss what is an engaging and entertaining movie experience. A film definitely worth watching. 8/10",8,0,0,5 April 1999
The Waterboy," Silly but satisfying
","This movie is a real no-brainer, but if that's what you're looking for then this baby is right up your alley. Adam Sandler specialises in this type of film, switch off the cerebellum and just revel in the stupidity. The Waterboy is not going to win any awards or even make its audience think, but it will inspire some laughs if you let it. As for it being similar to Happy Gilmour, you might as well say that it is identical to half of the movies produced in Hollywood - unlikely hero comes good, gets faced with a difficult challenge, overcomes it an wins the game in the last few minutes! Sheesh, what movie doesn't use this formula nowadays? In short, don't expect too much from the film and you won't be disappointed. My vote 6/10",6,30,44,8 August 1999
Before Sunrise," Come on people
","Let's get serious here. Although this was a cute and entertaining movie it is certainly no all-time classic. Sure the characters are moderately engaging and the story is cute, even the dialogue is tolerable, but this is just another romantic fable with a modern spin - nothing more! 7/10",7,4,10,22 April 1999
Casino," Very skillful movie
","It would be difficult to find a flaw in this film. It has been criticised for its violence - its a violent story, its language - the characters swear a lot, and even that it has all been done before - is there a completely original idea anywhere? I really liked the use of the narrative too.I must admit, I saw a television version so a great deal of the language and violence was removed, but this was still a polished and classy film with an engaging story-line and talented cast. This film of paradise slowly unravelling is an interesting morality tale. Definitely worth a watch. My vote 8/10",8,2,2,25 March 1999
Jackie Brown," Long, but worthwhile
","Not being much of a fan of Tarantino, I really wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. It's long, no question, but it is a very clever story, skilfully acted, and with enough interesting twists to make it a movie worth seeing. The cast was excellent, with performances delivered brilliantly. The much talked about dialogue, sharp and smart. I will admit 'though that for the first 10 minutes or so I thought the movie was set in the '70s! In all, a fairly classy and intelligent movie, a bit gritty, and definitely worth a look.",7,0,1,26 October 1998
Aladdin," IMHO
","This movie is one of the better Disney animated films in recent years. Cute story, fun, light, entertaining and a catchy score to boot this is actually quite tolerable. 7/10",7,7,12,11 May 1999
