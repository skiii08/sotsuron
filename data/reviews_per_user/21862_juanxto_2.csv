Skyfall," Not a Bond movie
","I was very excited with this new release of Bond's adventures as I had read a lot of very good critics in the internet about it. But after seeing the movie, I feel as if I had been taken to another kind of spies movie, not an actual Bond one.First of all, there is a lack of all the well known ingredients a good Bond movie must have. I mean: no good car (old one instead), no amazing gadgets, no bond girl (I'm sorry, but I could not even feel a bit of sorry when she doesn't appear anymore as I had just met her 10 minutes ago), no evil villain who wants to control the World (just kind of an homosexual one who just wants to kill an old lady) and, of course, no James Bond at all (the guy looks old, tired and a step behind an enemy whose more remarkable power just seems to be computing).To summarize, it's totally disappointing. It's a pity because I really liked the last two films (CR and QoS) as there was this kind of hidden organization which felt as a real threat for the world and I expected that plot would come to an end with this movie. Moreover, I enjoyed the new Bond, so though, professional and realistic compared to the older ones... A missed chance to have finished a Bond era with an spectacular end movie.",3,6,28,4 February 2013
Drive," An unexpected pleasant surprise
","This is my first review for IMDb and I have to say that I've decided to do so because this movie has made me feel something I haven't felt with any other movie in the last few years.As an overall, the words which would better describe this feeling are 'strangely beautiful'. Lots of people have criticized the long pauses and silents from the actors, and even though they have transmitted me more than dozens of spoken dialogs in other movies. Looks are self-explanatory, vibrant and full of emotions and unspoken things. The main character is completely awesome, one of those who will stay in your memory, full of details and with a meaning for everything he does, says or doesn't say. And the music is really good, with an 80's flavor but not being completely old-fashioned. I can still remember the songs in my mind.Anyway, and I think this is the source for all the bad feedback this movie has got, you must be aware that this is not one of the latest kind action movie. You won't see spectacular chases, nor long shooting scenes, nor even explosions. This doesn't mean it is not violent; I can assure you it has some of the more violent scenes you could watch in the last few years.As a summary, I recommend this movie as a whole product. It may not be a great action movie, nor a romantic one, nor a noir movie and at the same time, it is all together at once. I would dare to say that if you liked Leon, you will like this one as well as both movies are more about the persons and their relationship than the action itself. An enjoyable experience.",8,2,4,22 April 2012
