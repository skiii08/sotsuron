The Monuments Men," In the vein of The Longest Day and Band of Brothers, an episodic adventure from World War II
","This film was a surprise to me in that it was not about six or eight adventurers and funny men, was not a World War II edition of Oceans 11, but is the several tales of art experts, acting alone or in pairs, commissioned as a group to locate and save art stolen by the Nazis.The individual actors play to form, the history was interesting, the writing was predictable and substandard.I would probably never replay this film, but, for those interested in World War II and its small stories, this is worth a few bucks to see. Certainly it is not an epic or moving war adventure in the ilk of Saving Private Ryan.",5,27,49,6 February 2014
