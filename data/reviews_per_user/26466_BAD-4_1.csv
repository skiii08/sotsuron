Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Review
","I will separate the categories to give a good overview of my opinion of the film.My views: I am a huge Star Wars fan.  I thought this movie was a disappointment, bear with me as I tell you why.Acting: I thought most of the major roles were played well with the script they were given.(especially Ray Parks, Natalie Portman)  Most of the extras were downright awful.  Some of the non-main actors could have been better.Directing: I thought the action scenes were well done(the best action scene is the lightsabre duel Between the two Jedi and Darth Maul) but a bit boring and repetitive at times. (Notably the unfunny, unscary, underwater 'bigger fish' sequence) The film is fast and furious.  Too fast, you never get to sit back, relax and just enjoy the scenery or an actor expressions.  No atmosphere.Writing: The script fails at many things.  Lack of story.  No plot twists. A poor attempt at humor ruins things.  If we are to buy into 'the force' and alien cultures it needs to be taken seriously.  Sure I want to have fun and laugh, so they should have something ironic to Star Wars or our modern culture, but not too much.(Star Wars isn't a comedy) Most of the better characters (Darth Maul,Jedi Council) don't get enough lines.  The force isn't explained or expanded.(so you better have seen the other films) Aliens don't speak English last I checked, much less have a Chinese accent. Predictability. R2D2 and C3PO are here just for fan fare.  Several things are unbelievable (Anikan in the Space battle).Special Effects: The special effects are good but, seemed forced and don't blend well with the actors or environments.  The computer-generated effects are so overused it's jarring and repetitive.  Jar Jar Binks and other characters are here purely for effect or comedy relief.  This is supposed to be a prequel and the technology should be less advanced but, with flashy effects filling every frame of footage the first Star Wars Trilogy seems less advanced.Overall: The film is good if you like special effects over story.  I thought this was a disappointment.  Go rent the original Star Wars Trilogy.",Null,0,1,1 July 1999
