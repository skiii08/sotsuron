The Blair Witch Project," Nightmarish images not enough to overcome nauseating work
","It seems that people these days are looking for a film that will transcend the horror film genre. Unfortunately, this movie does not do that.Now, I like all kinds of movies, and especially love the kinds that scare you to death. Although I was on the edge of my seat waiting for something to happen, 'it' never really happenned, and what I was left with was disappointment, and nausea, not from being disturbed or scared, but rather from the annoying camerawork to give it the faux-documentary look. In many horror films, you find yourself screaming to the screen, 'Don't go down there!' or 'Watch out behind you!' In this case, you find yourself asking, 'How is that possible that you are so stupid?' or 'When is someone going to die?' This is partly due to the fact that the characters are a little annoying, so you have no sympathy. And second, they really are THAT stupid. (How can you manage to navigate yourself in a complete circle hiking all day, if you plan to just go south?? Can't you just use the sun?)On the upswing, there are some images which are very creepy, ones that would give you nightmares. But, it's not enough to make this film work. My vote: 3/10",3,0,2,29 July 1999
