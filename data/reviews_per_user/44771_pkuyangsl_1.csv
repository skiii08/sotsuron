Blade Runner 2049," Long , boring and overrated
","The movie lasts for 3 hours without any exciting points. The movie is gloomy style - that's fine but the gloomy future does not contain anything new. The plot moves pretty slowly and lets me want to fall asleep. All the fights were just ordinary fights - not stunning. Only suitable for those who extremely sensitive and think a lot about human future. For ordinary people like me, do not waste the money on it!",1,25,55,10 October 2017
