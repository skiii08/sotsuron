The Blair Witch Project," This is the WORST movie ever!
","Just because a movie is unique or different (like this movie), it doesn't automatically mean it's good.  Many people give it too much credit for being different.  This movie was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!  NOTHING worked in the movie.  It was NOT scary!  It was NOT entertaining at all.After the torture of sitting through this movie was over, the credits were rolling and the audience was completely silent.  After a few seconds, a woman behind me said loudly, 'THAT'S IT?!?'  It is the WORST movie ever!",1,3,6,21 September 2000
The Blair Witch Project," The Worst Movie of All-time!
","Just because a movie is unique or different (like this movie), doesn't automatically mean it's good. Many people gave it too much credit for being different. This movie was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!! NOTHING worked in the movie. It was NOT scary! It was NOT entertaining at all.After the torture of sitting through this movie, I felt like the biggest sucker for paying about $9 to see the movie. They could have stamped the word sucker on everyone's forehead after leaving the theater. Don't waste your time!",1,1,4,1 July 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Very Funny! A-
","This movie was extremely funny! There are many things that women do that turn off men and this movie goes through most of them. Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey were great! Not only did they act very well, they had great chemistry, and were a match physically. This movie was much better than I expected. So far in 2003, it is my favorite movie. I'll give it an A-. This might go down as one of my all-time favorites! Gwyneth Paltrow was offered the part first and turned it down. They hired Kate Hudson and are sooooo glad they did. I think Kate was much, much better than Gwyneth ever could have been! I definitely recommend this movie!",10,0,0,10 February 2003
The Patriot," This is the Best movie of 2000, so far!
","If you like war movies, Mel Gibson, and/or fight scenes you'll love this film!  Mel Gibson was excellent!  The fight scenes are better than the scenes in the other 2000 action blockbuster, The Gladiator.  The fight scenes are more realistic in The Patriot as opposed to virtual in The Gladiator.  I definitely recommend this film.",10,0,2,5 July 2000
Pearl Harbor," Kate Beckinsale was GREAT!!!
","The 2 things I will remember from this film are the great battle scenes and Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). Beckinsale looks absolutely beautiful in this film! I think Josh Hartnett did a poor job of acting. It was either his poor southern accent or Hartnett trying speak with a deeper voice. He looked like a bad actor.Overall, I give this film a B-.",7,0,0,4 June 2001
Pulp Fiction," Skip this movie!!!
","Over the last 3 years, I have seen over 100 movies per year. I finally got around to seeing Pulp Fiction. This movie was very slow for most of the movie, had very weak plots, and was not entertaining. It was also very violent, so parents should think twice about letting their children see this movie. If you are one of the many people who fall into the trap of liking a movie because it is 'different', then maybe you'll like this movie. For everyone else, I recommend skipping this movie!!! It was a waste of 2 hours and 45 minutes.",3,6,16,24 December 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Did you understand it? Grade: B
","I saw The Matrix Reloaded twice on opening weekend. I think many of the people who did not like the movie, did NOT understand it. I've read some comments that there was no plot, but there definitely WAS. You just have to understand the movie to realize what the plot was. If you didn't like the movie or didn't understand it, maybe you should see it again. The plot was decent/pretty good, the love story was good, and the action & effects were GREAT!",7,0,0,19 May 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Jennifer Connelly was Great!
","Jennifer Connelly had her best performance to date! She looked beautiful! Russell Crowe did a good job, although he was a little too macho at times during the movie. It seems like his character should have been more timid and less witty. Overall, the movie was pretty good, B-.",6,0,1,2 January 2002
Vanilla Sky," Overall Grade, C-
","**Spoilers**  Tom & Penelope had great chemistry in the film. For a love story to work, you must want the couple to get or stay together. I did want them to get together. I totally understood the film, but one of the main reasons I did not like it was the story was too dark. They did not get together in the end, although even if they did, it would have improved the film only slightly.The movie is different, but remember this. Just because a movie is different, does NOT mean the movie is automatically good. I think a lot of people fall into that trap.",5,0,1,27 December 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," This is one of my top 2 movies
",This movie is excellent!  It was made in 1977 and was way ahead of its time. The visual and sound effects are great.  It won many awards.  There is so much to love about this film.  A young Harrison Ford leads the group of actors that were superb.  People of all ages enjoyed this film that started a classic series.,10,0,0,6 July 2000
