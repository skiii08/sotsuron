Lucky Number Slevin," Tries too hard
","This is a film that has some style and isn't all bad by any means, but in the end it comes out looking like a mish mash of several Cohen Brothers films and The Usual Suspects. The cast do 'ok' but really everything about the film falls just short of being anywhere near that league. The script is lively in places, but tedious and too 'clever' in others, and much the same could be said for the storyline. The direction and sets are sometimes impressive, but somehow fail to create any really convincing atmosphere or suspense.I knew nothing about this film before watching it, but very early on its shortcomings were pretty clear. The 'tying up' of all the loose ends takes rather a long time, and doesn't leave enough mystery (and anyway by then none of it comes as any surprise).Better than your average dumb shoot'em up, but in the end it's a pale imitation of much better films.(Oh, and the plot is full of holes, but i'll be generous and say that most films of this type rely on a decent amount of disbelief suspension!)",6,0,0,25 August 2012
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Great film
","Pitt is outstanding, as are so many of the cast. It's a slow paced film, not the shoot'em up that some might expect, but I was immersed from start to finish. Admittedly I was marvelling at how fantastic it looked playing the blu-ray on my new TV, but even so there was very little not to like.I know nothing about the actual history of these events, or the book upon which the film is based, so I cannot comment on it's accuracy or otherwise. But it drew me in completely. It is suspenseful in a fairly understated way, Pitt is menacing but human; his idoliser, Robert Ford, is complex and tragic. The supporting cast all put in strong performances.Despite the fact that the (near) ending is already known, when it comes, it is mesmeric.Some reviewers have commented that it is too long, perhaps I can see that the section immediately after Jesse's death which briefly covers the rest of Robert Ford's life could have been omitted, but actually the film is about him as much as it is about Jesse, and I wanted to know his fate. I am glad it was there.The camera work and direction are stunning.See it! And if you have access to HD then you'll really appreciate it.",9,1,1,22 August 2012
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Benjamin Button reminds us all that Time is Precious
","Perhaps the most overwhelming emotion I experienced during and after this film was that we have only so much time in which to enjoy life. Unfortunately this reminder of our mortality had nothing to do with having watched a deep, insightful, thought-provoking film, but instead was because I had just sat through over 2 and a half hours of really very dull movie.I have nothing against slow films. I am not an action film junkie in any way and would rather enjoy a thoughtful experience at the cinema than some car-chase thriller with a generic plot/characters/dialogue/soundtrack. But The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was a big disappointment. In fact the only curious thing about it was that it ever made it into my local picturehouse cinema.It did not strike me as a particularly original or clever concept, not that a film necessarily has to be either, but in this case at least a dose of one or the other would have made the experience more bearable. As it was I spent a good deal of the second half looking at my watch... which seemed to be going backwards. Unfortunately unlike Benjamin instead of feeling younger at the end I felt a good deal older than when I had taken my seat.So I am writing this a long time after having watched it, but having seen that somehow it rated 8/10 on IMDb I felt duty bound to add my voice of discontent!",3,2,3,25 July 2010
