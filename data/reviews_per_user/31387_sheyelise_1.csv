United 93," Kick ass movie but not everyone is ready
","I saw the movie last night. My stomach was in knots;I couldn't even finish my popcorn I was so on edge. It starts off kind of slow but it was an excellent movie. I wouldn't recommend it to the emotional or overly sensitive. I could hear others in the theatre sniffling and wiping at their eyes and when we exited many were still crying, tissues in hand. It was very graphic and detailed. But during the climax a sense of pride swelled in my heart as they counterattacked. It was like 'Hell yell, that's Americans!' Can't f*** with us!I will agree that something is fishy about 9/11 and I do believe there are some coverups and a lot of unanswered questions. But some of these conspricacy theorists are waaay in left field. In particular, the speculation that it wasn't Flight 77 that crashed into the Pentagon. And yet another that claims Flight 93 didn't crash in Penn but actually landed at a Boston airport. Okay...let's say we give these claims the benefit of the doubt. Answer me one thing: WHERE THE HELL ARE THE PASSENGERS AND CREW?!!!!",10,2,12,29 April 2006
