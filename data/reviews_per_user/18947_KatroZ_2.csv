Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Some *POSITIVE* comments!
","The Phantom Menace was amazing!  Spectacular special effects, thanks to ILM! The story was fun and the battles were cool.  It's a quite a bit lighter than the original films, but in a great way!  It shows that the Star Wars universe CAN have great humorous characters and events, while still holding the familiar sci-fi action.  If you want a lighthearted (mostly... there's still some darkness and drama in it) and mind blowing fun movie, this is it.",10,0,0,24 May 1999
X-Men," FANTASTIC!!!
","Without a doubt THE best comic-based film and one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time!!  I can't wait for the sequels to come in and anticipate the DVD release!  EXTREMELY accessable to all filmgoers even if they aren't fans of the comic or comics in general... even if they HATE the X-Men comic, they'll love the movie!  See it a billion-zillion times!",10,0,0,6 August 2000
