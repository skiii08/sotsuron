Catch Me If You Can," Catch a good movie
","I don't believe that it's the films stars that make the movie this time. It just so happens that Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks were cast.  It could just as well have been any number of actors today.  I think DiCaprio was chosen because he still looks very young.  On the other hand he does exude a certain charm and it's a good performance.  Hanks on the other hand, starts out sounding like a character and ends up sounding like the guy from Castaway.  That would be how he usually sounds. The film is not a landmark or even a great movie.  It tells a fictionalized account of the title character's true story but not in the same way as a Dog Day Afternoon.  It just stands on it's own as a good movie, something that might have come out during the summer.  It's not a notable Steven Speilberg film because of the directing.  It's pretty standered, old fashioned Speilberg, although the choices he does make all work well for the story.  The story grabs your attention and just when it seems it might lose track, it always grabs your attention back. It stands as one of the few Spielberg films that don't have a tacky sentimental ending added on for the kids.  The true life story already has a happy ending, so Spielberg follows what seems natural and one doesn't feel manipulated.  Cristopher Walkin, manages to give a better performance than Hanks.  The supporting players come out better than the stars.  It's a Speilberg film that tells a great story, minus the special effects, running ontime, with just enough humor and worth watching.  It's his fastest moving film.  That's a good sign. 8 out of 10",Null,0,0,26 December 2002
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Wes Craven is a good director, but NOT a good writer
","Let me tell you in one word why this movie is very poorly made.  Simply put, it's the writing.  Wes Craven has written other things in his time but when he set out to write this screenplay, he wrote some horrible dialogue! This whole movie is runed because of it's poor dialogue and idiotic situations.  Only the character of Nancy played by Heather Lagenkamp is credible onscreen.  Even Johnny Depp, the most underrated actor of the past two decades and a great character actor, stumbles over the lines as if he where in an elementary school production.  The character of Freddy, although somewhat scary in this first movie, loses alot of the presence he has by joking and snickering.  There's no suspense, only shock value.  Everything looks like it was filmed on a sitcom stage.  It almost feels like an eighties hairmetal music video.  Maybe another factor is that this movie didn't age well at all. To prove that Wes Craven started out with an interesting idea and turned it into grade B junk, one need only look towards Scream.  While Scream was a partial parody, it was also a far superior horror movie.  Scream was written by Kevin Williamson and only directed by Wes Craven.  It is Craven's most popular movie.  Watch the first A Nightmare on Elm Street ( the sequels are even worse) for curiosity's sake or for the great, creepy special effects. But don't expect, natural dialogue, suspense, logical situations, or for 'Nightmare' to even hold a candle to Scream or Halloween.",5,7,15,11 July 2002
