The Rock," The Best Action Movie Ever!
","The Rock is a superb action movie, and I think, the best ever made! This movie is all action. In it's 135 minute length, only about 15 minutes are not action!. The cast is superb, especially Ed Harris as General Francis X Hummel of the United States Marine Corps. Sean Connery also stands out as ex SAS captain John Patrick Mason. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is brilliant, and this movie is worth seeing just for that reason alone! 10/10",Null,1,1,20 April 2001
Chicken Run," Brilliant!
","This is the best movie of the year, and will be hard to beat! I saw it last night, and really enjoyed it. The humor is excellent, and will have everybody laughing, and Mel Gibson does well with the voice of Rocky the Flying Rooster. The final escape scene is superb, and the film is well worth buying when it comes out on video! It gets 10/10 from me",10,1,2,2 July 2000
The Patriot," Good but stupid
","Being English, I hate it when Hollywood creates films showing how one American won the war. This has occurred with the Second World War as well.Newspapers say that Americans claim to have won the war for the Allies, but it was the ENGLISH that broke Germany's Enigma code.",Null,1,3,21 October 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Pretty Bad!
","This film was pretty awful! I saw it on a flight from Manchester to Newark, thinking that it would be brilliant. All of the hype gives the wrong impression. This film was AWFUL. Fair enough, the fight scenes were well done, but I think I'll stick to Jackie Chan for Kung Fu fighting. Now for the plotWhat was it all about? I gather it had something to do with a sword that was stolen, and needed to be retrieved. That is about the limit of my understanding of this movie. If you want to see good fights, watch Jackie Chan movies. If you want to see a good plot, watch Gladiator. If you want to spend a couple of hours with your brain turned off, watch Crouching Tiger.I just wish that I watched Proof of Life sooner!!",Null,0,0,28 May 2001
Black Hawk Down," One of the Best War Movies of All Time!
","Black Hawk Down is one of the best war movies of all time, but the remarkable thing is that it is a TRUE story!People complain that the visuals are wrong, or the lines that the actors say during the battle is laughable, but how do they know? Were they there? Granted, artistic licence has a part, but, by all accounts, this is a very real account of what happened in October 1993.Those people that say they couldn't care less which characters died have not taken into account that it was real people that were killed, and the actors are just showing the audience what happened.Anyway, back to the film. This is about a mission that I would class as a successful failure (the objective was completed, but too many good men lost their lives for no reason at all). The whole movie was really tense, and, even though I had read the book before seeing this movie, I was really shocked at the way some of the Rangers were killed, and amazed at the courage of the two Delta snipers (Shughart and Gordon) who dropped in on their own to protect Durant's crash site against crowds of Somalies. No wonder these two men were awarded the Medal of Honor! The film, for its length of 144 minutes, was basically a 120 minute running battle, with 20 minutes of build up at the beginning.The battle was well filmed, and, even though the characters were hard to tell at points, the script was good.Sure, there were things missed out of the film that were in the book, such as the airdrop of ammo and IV bags, and Mike Durant being forced to make a video, but ultimately, these wouldn't have really made a difference to the film.Don't believe these so-called 'professional' reviewers in newspapers. I read a review this morning where the reviewer kept talking about a film that was 10 minutes shorter than the real movie, and he mentioned things that were not in either the book or the movie.I recommend that you make up your own mind about this movie, but don't go to see it is you don't like too much blood and gore. I give this film 10/10, and a place in my DVD collection when it comes out!",10,1,2,18 January 2002
The Mummy Returns," A Great Movie!!!!
","This movie was superb! The action was great, the script was fairly good, and the special effects were brilliant (apart from the computer generated Scorpion King at the end. This was cheesy) There was more action than in the original. Sometimes this can be good, sometimes it can be bad. Here it was good!This movie, like most sequels, does some things better than the original. This one does the action and special effects better than the original, but the script is weaker.The acting was good, and Brendan Fraser was outstanding as Rick O'Connell, as was Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep.If you liked the original, you will like this. I give it 4/5",Null,0,0,18 May 2001
Total Recall," One of the best!
","This is one of Arnold Schwazenegger's best movies (after the Terminator films), and one of the best Sci-Fi films of all time (after the Terminator series and Aliens). The plot is quite simple, but the action is top notch stuff. The body count hits the rafters (more than Commando?) and Arnie kills some of the bad guys in rather gruesome ways. The special effects are good (for 1990), and the script is laced with Arnie's one-liners (such as killing his 'wife', played by Sharon Stone, after she tries to kill him, and saying 'Consider that a divorce')All in all, one of the best Sci-Fi/Action movies around, and a must for any Schwazenegger fan. 4/5",Null,0,1,10 January 2002
The Sixth Sense," Utter Rubbish!!
","I have never seen anything worse, except for Three Kings and Wild Wild West. This movie was utter rubbish. It wasn't scary, the script was bad, and the twist at the end was all too predicatible. I guessed it within the first quarter of an hour, and I didn't know anything about the movie. I only saw it for the first time last night. Everybody says the plot twist at the end is brilliant, but how can it be if people can guess it? Everybody that I know that has seen this says the same. The only redeeming factor was some good acting by Bruce Willis. One of the worst films ever made. 1/10",Null,0,1,27 May 2001
The Matrix," SUPERB!
","This is a great action movie, and the best I have ever seen! I only saw this the other night, but I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD today! The plot is great, the acting is superb and the action is brilliant! The Kung Fu scene is nearly up to Jackie Chan standards, and the gun battle in the lobby is amazing. This film has great special effects, and Carrie-Anne Moss is outstanding as Trinity. I can't wait for 'The Matrix 2'!",9,0,0,6 January 2001
Gladiator," Simply Amazing!!
","Gladiator is quite simply one of the best movies ever made, and it deserved each of the 5 Academy Awards that it won. The story is brilliant, the acting is outstanding, and the soundtrack is perfect.All of the acting performances are outstanding, but the most memorable performance is that of Russell Crowe. His performance here put him at the top of the Hollywood A-list, and he deserved the Best Actor award. He is riveting as Maximus, the Roman General who was betrayed. He was forced to become a slave, and then a gladiator. Some of the most memorable quotes come from the character of Maximus, such as 'My name is Gladiator'.Another outstanding performance is that of Connie Nielsen as Lucilla.The action scenes are well done, and extremely bloody, but this makes them more authentic.If you haven't seen this movie yet, you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made.Definately 10/10!",10,0,0,29 October 2001
