Raiders of the Lost Ark," Classic- No Doubt About It
","Movie fun just don't get any better than this. Superstar Harrison Ford and 'Animal House''s Karen Allen star in one of the best Steven Spielberg movies ever. Taking place in 1936, Indiana Jones(Ford) is called in by the army to help find the Ark of the Covenent before the archeology crazed Nazis can find it and become invincible in the eve of WWII. Traveling to Egypt along with old flame Marion(Allen) he meets the Nazi's archaeologist: Belloq(Paul Freeman), an old rival of Jones. Incredible action sequences, great special effects for it's time, awesome acting, and a few of the most famous lines of all time are stuffed into this fantastic movie. An unforgettable cast includes Ford, Allen, Freeman, John-Ryhs Davies (Lord of the Rings), Denholm Elliot,Ronald Lacey, and Alfred Molina (Spiderman 2). The incredible, indescribable 'Raiders' will leave you in awe forever. Overall-10/10.",10,0,0,4 April 2006
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Pretty Good- Not as Good as Jurassic Park, not as bad as JP3
","Okay, the best Jurassic Park is obviously Jurassic Park. It was the most faithful to the fantastic Michael Critchton books, plus it was well done. As a sequel, The Lost World does just fine. Of course, I'm used to seeing horrible sequels all the time. Jeff Goldblum does a good job reprising his role as Ian Malcolm, and the newcomers of Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn do well too. The story is a little unbelievable, though. After recently being replaced by his nephew as CEO of InGen, John Hammond(Richard Attenburough) reveals to Ian Malcolm(Goldblum) a site B: A place where dinosaurs run free. He sends him and his girlfriend, Sarah Harding(Moore), technology expert Eddie Carr(Richard Schiff) and photographer Nick Van Owen(Vaughn) to document the dinosaurs, while the official InGen team, led by Roland Tembo(Pete Postlethwaite), tries to capture the T. Rex and transport it to San Diego. As always, there is many bone-crunching deaths, the Special FX are excellent, but the story and plot fall a a bit short. Overall: 7/10",7,132,191,25 March 2006
