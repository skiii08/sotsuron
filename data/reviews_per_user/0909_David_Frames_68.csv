Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The shallow end of genius
","How clever of Quentin Tarantino to plunder his favourite movies and rework the highlights into this one note revenge tale, the second half of which tries to add substance to the story after a first volley which had all the depth of a teaspoon of water. You'll read on this site and many others that Kill Bill is a great work, a superb directorial effort, too good to be dismissed as trash according to Kim Newman. Well, not wishing to be rude to Mr.Newman, but this is a load of Thurman. Well directed your action surely is but the dialogue is as clumsy as this sentence without the ironic and therefore clever constructivism exhibited therein. Like this horribly self-indulgent review, every scene has the 'tino yelling 'did you see what i've done there?' at the audience before the entire enterprise eventually collaspses under the weight of it's own self-satisfied smugness. The literary framing device is also a dubious decision as it draws attention to the lack of story and character on display. If Kill Bill were a novel it would be airport lounge material. It could have been great had it been edited with the same ruthless efficency as the action, but it's overlong as a single film with an uneasy shift in pace and tone between the two halves that will surely weaken it as a single film should anyone choose to view it that way in the future. Kitchy, well made rubbish it may be but it's rubbish all the same. Ok, so it's not supposed to be profound but when Tarantino mentions your Kill Bills in the same breath as Raiders of the Lost Ark and Leone's Dollars Trilogy, it's clear that seeing every film under the sun and enjoying them enough to rip them off is not akin to understanding how those movies work and why or, lets face it, how the filmmakers involved reworked genre conventions and movie tropes to produce something fresh and sustantial without being simply derivative. Soulless stuff.",Null,0,1,6 May 2004
Frost_Nixon," Good craic.
","It wasn't exactly a meeting of minds, nor was it motivated by a need to get to the truth, but the set of interviews that brought disgraced President Richard Nixon into a room with David Frost, is a fascinating historical tit bit Â– an act of opportunism on both sides that lead to one of the most sensational disclosures in the history of television political journalism. Nixon had broken the law and this unlikely confessional took place in the company of a light entertainment presenter. Imagine Tony Blair confessing he lied about the reasons for going to war in Iraq to Des O Connor and you realise how amazing this actually was.Howard's film is fairly dispassionate in its treatment of both men. Frost, played with delicious smarm and just the right amount of arrogance by Michael Sheen, is constituted as a fledgling but highly libidinous talk show host, who in Nixon sees an opportunity to reinvigorate his celebrity and gain credibility in the US. Nixon on the other hand is in denial about his role in the Watergate scandal, fired up with a sense of self-righteousness and indignation at the liberal 'sons of bitches' that brought him down and is determined to use the encounter to rewrite history to his own advantage. Both men, it's suggested, have something to prove to themselves and their peers but mercifully the shadowy reflection angle isn't laboured en route to the tense exchanges. The climax, when it comes, manages to be both mesmerising and moving, not least because both actors meet the requirement of transcending mere impersonation and inhabit their characters. When you're told that Nixon's face betrayed, better than any trial, the personal regret, hubristic folly and watershed breakdown in the relationship between the American electorate and its government, thanks to Frank Langella, you believe it.",7,18,36,20 October 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Flat
","The first was technically accomplished but a quart incomprehensible, the second was overcooked and underwhelming - a pretentious bore and four million years later it's the third, half a centilitre deeper than than it's predecessors, better rounded but curiously bereft of energy or involvement - in short, its flat. JJ Abrams, the televisual wunderkind was handpicked by the Crusier based on his success in similar genres, particularly a show called Alias which is apparently was inspired by...mission impossible! Who better to helm one then? Well I don't know but on this evidence, a movie director might have been a better bet. Abrams script makes the mistake of trying to humanise the action hero by showing us a smattering of his personal life and then, and i hope your sitting down, involving her in the plot. A terrific opening teaser sets the scene with Hoffman's villain asking a bound Cruise for information on the Rabbit's foot - the plot's maguffin. His wife is bound in a chair with a gun to her head and then nasty mock-Capote tells our hero that she'll self-destruct in 10 seconds if he doesn't give him the foot's location. I once read that Tony Benn and Neil Kinnock had a similar conversation about Michael Foot in the run up to the 1983 election but thats just Westminster tittle-tattle I'm sure. Anyway, following this tantalising sequence the movie runs into a pedestrian stride rather than the sprint we might have expected. The inner Hunt takes centre stage while the action winds down and although the movie is cluttered with gunfire, chases, running and the usual explosions, nothing sticks, probably because Abrams medium is television and what works there seems strangely so-so on the big screen. The original movie was well served by De Palma's technical acumen - a perfect partner for the tricksy, twisty-turny nature of the t.v show. There's none of that bravura direction on display third time round nor any stand out set piece to mark out the mission's 'impossible' promise. The first had the Langley theft and the Channel Tunnel finale - here its all low key and more real worldly - fine but this is Mission: Impossible and we expect a bit of the outlandish. Better than the second when all is said and done but not quite the shilling - M:I:3 is conspicuously bland - the next will need a more extravagant pair of hands at the wheel if we're going to be convinced to bankroll the Cruiser's next divorce. Are you listening short arse?",5,0,1,21 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Planet Hype and the Nostalgateers
","Aged 13 I made a terrible discovery. Not only had I been wrong about the age of consent in the UK but my Father wasn't the man I thought he was. My mother sat me down and told me that Dad wasn't the perfect patriarch I'd envisioned in my youth. In fact he was an adulterous alcoholic with dangerous artistic pretensions. Yes, my Father wasn't so much John Steed, more Olly Reed, his worse moment being a live restaurant urination in front of 300 stunned diners at the Greenwich Steakhouse. Its hard to explain the disappointment I felt at that point but at least I thought after this it would be hard to feel too letdown again by anything.Not so.Flash forward to June 1999, New York City. Yours truly is treated to a revisionist revival of Star Wars in which any hope, new or otherwise, that the years may have paved the way for writer/director Geroge Lucas to craft a mature, pared down, excitement laden prequel to films which many people know better than themselves, is dashed with horrific cruelty. Never go back, my old man had said and for once he'd been right.The Phantom Menace attempts to fill in the back story to the classic trilogy but arguably starts too early in the story. Forgetting completely that the young audience of the original are now slightly more demanding adults, Lucas aims low and hits every time, his target audience preschoolers and under 12's. Attempting to manufacture what happened accidentally via positive communal experience is a dangerous game to play and Lucas doesn't foul so much as get sent off mid-way through the match having butchered all the other players. Jake Lloyd is awful as the young Anakin and conspicuously gives no clues as to motives for future wrongdoing. This of course would make him less heroic to viewers of similar ages thus effecting those all important toy sales. Jar Jar Binks, with a personality as deep as the pixels that create him is an offensively unfunny racial stereotype - a ridiculous and cynical creation. Ewan McGregor as Kenobi manages to demystify the old Jedi Master completely by giving a performance so lifeless he could be a computer generated effect himself and Yoda is realised by sub-standard puppetry that gives him all the authority of an action figure. The simple good versus evil, old serial heroics of the original film are lost here as Lucas tries to tell a more complicated story but forgets to make it interesting. Lucas' pompous script mixes undergraduate politics with some of the worst dialogue ever committed to film. Take your pick from 'Wizard!', 'Get this stunted slime out of my presence' or if that isn't quite bad enough for you, what about 'Ooooh, sticky goo!'. Lawerence Kasdan was only a phone call away George.Finally Lucas's return to directing prompted by developments in computer technology serves as the film's conceptual oveur. Not bothered by characterisation or coherent storytelling, skills that made the original film so enduring, this prequel under uses its best characters, overuses it worse and clothes them in wall to wall digitisation, making a hyperrealist construction that fails to engage emotionally on any level. Ultimately, like this review, its just f**king boring and thats the worst charge you could level at a series as iconic as this one. The 'Cus has dismissed any criticism of this the Phantom Menace by pointing out that it's merely the first act in a 6 act series. Fine, but surely they taught Lucas at film school that the first act is supposed to hook the audience. Whoever heard of a first act that DISSUADED an audience from watching the rest. Whichever way you look at it it's poor film-making. Computers are wonderful but they can't compensate for poor storytelling and dull characters. Sorry George.",4,2,4,10 June 2003
Raiders of the Lost Ark," If only you spoke Horvedos...
","A pitch perfect homage to the Republic Adventure Serials of the 1940's, directed with energy and assuredness of touch by Steven Spielberg who injects the B movie material with an attention to character and composition missing from the majority of comtempory blockbusters. Lawence Kasdan's script based on George Lucas's story is a masterclass in lean, affectionately crafted action cinema with any extraneous scenes torn out. Thus its effectively a series of finally crafted set pieces laced together with the odd expositionary moment where necessary, moving toward its exceptional climax, possibly one of the best of all time, with boundless enthusiasm, pace and wit. There is a line of argument, particularly amongst European Critics, that the success of Raiders...cemented a trend in American Cinema that had begun with Jaws and then Star Wars for the kind of thrill seeking feature that has lead to the degradation of so much big-budget output throughout the following 20 years. Its ironic certainly, because Raiders is such a well made and perfectly styled creation made with an obvious affection for a lost form that it effortlessly ellipses other films of its type and remains the benchmark by which this type of movie must be judged.",9,1,2,26 April 2005
Star Trek," It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
","The new Star Trek is all consuming - undercutting low expectations with a colourful landscape of rich visuals married with pace and driven by kinetic flair both in front of and behind the camera. Abram's Mission Impossible looked flat and felt static but Star Trek really moves with swooning camera movements, conspicuously eye catching composition and a degree of self-confidence that scoops you up and carries you along for that Hollywood Holy Grail â€“ 'the ride'. There's artistry in its visual effects, an omission from most blockbusters, and the design is a combination of craft and graft, contrasting the smooth sheen of the Enterprise's bridge with her new boiler room bowels. Its future tech with a touch of real world grease and it speaks to the filmmakers intentions of partnering the geek aesthetic with something less esoteric for the unconverted. Ironically for a movie that turns on future proofing legacies, the film's weakness is its story that feels slight and is driven by the commercial requirement to clear the decks for a new series of films â€“ a deficiency that will become more apparent as time strips away its visual impact. Given that the script lacks any of the emotional or intellectual rigour that at least threatened to punctuate previous instalments, it does at least introduce a sense of fun and bravado that alludes to the best of the original series and it's more of a romp than before, signalling a new direction that owes as much to Star Wars, much apparent in the movie's dramatic thrust, as much to the series whose name it bears. Goodwill notwithstanding, there are elements to this new approach that won't sit easily with aficionados of the Enterprise. The decision to wipe out 43 years of continuity, well conceived but poorly explained and embodied in a villain who is more plot device than character, is a poor return on a lifetime of devotion for hardcore fans â€“ and the philosophical and moral implications of Nero's actions are given a cursory shrug in the interests of moving the story forward, a treatment which makes the decision seem flippant. The humour is sometimes too broad in a bid to appeal to an imaginary constituency of barely brain-stemmed teens, though it frequently recovers, and those on product placement watch will recoil with the news that both Nokia and Budweiser have made it to the 23rd century â€“ a feat all the more remarkable on account of the nuclear war that occurs in Trek's chronology between our present and the time occupied by the libidinous Captain of the Enterprise. Once the new cast settle into their familiar positions sometime during the final third, it feels natural and reassuringly familiar. Pine, retaining Shatner's cock sureness but dropping the melodramatic pauses, captures the spirit of his predecessor and is a worthy successor, though Orci and Kutzman could reward his performance by deepening his characterisation in the next instalment. Qunito's Spock is fine but lacks Nimoy's presence â€“ how you miss the dulcet tones and Karl Urban's Doctor McCoy is perfect â€“ instantly evocative of Deforrest Kelley without becoming an impersonation. True to the original series, the rest of the cast are little more than scenery, though the new Uhura is some of the best you'll see all year and certainly deserves more to do in future. Her sexually inspired turn adds a decent measure of human beauty to the gorgeous computer generated vistas. A sensory treat it may be, visual effects and production design spit roasting your optics, but the impact is undermined by the absence of an equally inspired score. Great genre movies are defined by their musical dimension â€“ imagine Star Wars without Williams, Blade Runner without Vangelis but the paucity of great compositions in recent years suggests that as the previous generation of great composers falls away, no one is coming up to replace them. A movie on this scale demanded symphonic support on an hysterical scale â€“ something akin to Goldsmith's intervention in the otherwise lifeless 1979 film, but instead it's a generic score that substitutes volume for melodic coherence and memorable motifs. You've heard the like many times before and will be pushed to recall a note of it afterwards. The composers will claim that the trend is now toward so called 'emotional augmentation' â€“ atmospheric scoring rather than out and out musical enrichment of the narrative, but this reduces what was once an integral part of these movies to clinical diagnostic support and it's unworthy of the potential of the movie score and the art form's heritage. Exciting, inviting and a little bit frightening (the new Chekov's accent is as unsettling as any planetary destruction), Star Trek will polarise die-hards but have little trouble charming the uninitiated. It has scale, energy and a likable interplay between the leads, all of which go a long way toward apologising for some of the screenplay's less intelligible choices. Where it does succeed ultimately, is in evoking the spirit if not the intellectual curiosity of Rodenberry's series, and although we'll expect an extra dimension to the characters in the next instalment, there's enough optimism on display here to allow the filmmakers the benefit of the doubtÂ…though just this once you understand.",7,2,10,14 May 2009
Fight Club," Essential Viewing
","There's a certain poetic nobility in Fight Club's disappointing box-office performance. After all, here's a movie that attacks product, profit and the capitalist doctrine and fails to be consumed - not what anyone intended but would it really do for the people involved to make an enormous windfall on the back of its release? It hardly matters anyway because anyone involved in Fight Club must have known that they'd made something so good that it would be adequate reward just to be associated with it. It's a seminal piece of work - a perfect conflation of visual and conceptual imagination that's as deceptive as one of Tyler's bars of soap. You may have thought you were going to see a movie about men beating each other up and the delicious truth is that that's just what many Americans DID think only to be confronted by a film that challenged the most basic assumptions upon which the western world functions - namely that unrestrained, free market commercial enterprise increases wealth and subsequently the quality of life. But Planet Starbucks isn't a paradise, it's nothingness and here's a film that says so more directly than most. Ed Norton's narrator is the emptiness at the heart of the system, emasculated by modernism, numbed by consumption - his life is a corporate by-product and the need to feel some kind of quantifiable human emotion creates Tyler Durden, an unrestrained force for personal liberation. Tyler's destructive counter-cultural revolution is an unflinching satirical knife to the throat of the thinking that blunts so many of us and it's astonishing to see this level of angry denunciation in a mainstream Hollywood movie. Fincher's movie is punk rock film-making, indifferent to the generic considerations that shape most American cinema and one which forces you to think about yourself and the forces that control your life. Freedom is an illusion Tyler shows us and Fincher reinforces this notion by drawing attention to the medium's illusionary potential in a series of virtuoso sequences which shatter that so-called forth wall just as the characters try and break free from the all-consuming commercial blandification of the modern world. A great film the first time you see it, a different film the second time and even better - Fight Club is a perfectly composed reaction to the modern age and its false promises. This movie really does have something important to say, whether you're ready to hear it or not is a different matter. Liberation starts here kids.",10,3,7,11 June 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Love movies, hate piracy
","Confected Kiddy-gut vomit with 'nutty' Depp, overpaid, hyped to his hilt and overindulged, giving the kind of performance that's endearing in the bedroom but has no place with a running camera on face. It's closer in conception to a video game than a piece of bone fide storytelling Â– numerous maguffins the vapid centre of its aimless forward thrust. It fills its face with busy visuals, contrived gags and pirate clichÃ©s, as bland and one dimensional as the ride it's based on. No real story, no depth, no reason to be Â– its perfect for an audience with no interest in style, character or imagination. A commercial behemoth that will please silly women who think Depp and Bloom are reason enough to see it Â– their superficial appeal an easy score for wholly minds, and silly boys who like their movies like their x-box titles. At the time of writing the biggest opening box office hit in history Â– the Godfather to this in just 30 years, no irony, no hope - unquestioned. Hollywood's rape of film culture continues unabated and with the consent of its drooling patrons. Part 3 awaits in May, a big-budget nonse offering your kids the promise of sweets from the jar marked 'entertainment'. Some simple laughs.",2,0,1,11 November 2006
Rocky V," Er, I suppose we better go for it.
","A sort of back to basics Rocky this - not very good or enjoyable unfortunately but nevermind. The forth instalment was something of a self-parodic apex for the series and there was no where left to go other than a fight between Rocky and Satan for the future of the world. Somewhat wisely sensing that perhaps the series had lost some of its original simple human drama and I do mean simple, original director John G.Avilsen was brought back to helm an instalment in which the cerebrally challenged champ is forced back to poverty when his accountant runs off with all of his money - hardly a problem you may think given the ease in forging a big X on the release papers. So its back to the old neighbourhood and Rocky takes on a cocky little upstart, Tommy Gun with the intention of living vicariously through him and getting back a bit of the old glory. When Gunn goes off with a corrupt Don King-type and forgets his old pal, the stage is set for yet another brawl, though this time its out in the street and the crowd consists of a few local drunks. The fifth and you'd have to say hopefully the last Rocky, is moribund stuff. Lots and lots of fairly middling family drama and the man himself can't even deliver the goods in the ring because of potential brain damage - not a problem in Rocky's 1-4 but again, nevermind. After Dolph Lundren the final fight is a major anti-climax, effectively a street punch-up and it all feels a bit like we're reliving old glories as much as the Stallion. A rather dull end to an otherwise enjoyable series.",4,2,7,7 June 2005
Hostel," Feel my Roth
","There's a sickness pervading Roth's promo for the Youth Hosteling Association. Having said that it's hard to dislike a movie which features attractive Eastern European women in permissive sexual mode - prone to large bouts of unnecessary but welcomed nudity and not too concerned about changing in view of male roommates. Such cynical devices are employed to get round the critical sensibilities of horror hating people like me who think this stuff is terminally devoid of merit, invention or wit and Roths pulled a blinder. For 45 minutes I was putty in his sick, gelatin covered hands and then, having got to the crux of it with those ignorant, hormonally retarded backpackers getting horrifically tortured for the pleasure of maladjusted 13 year olds and man-child fan-boy mastabators throughout the world, I strangely found myself drawn into Roths dirty little web - the Vincent Price like fly to his predatory house spider. Not in any way what you should be doing with your free time but nevertheless far better than you might dare to hope - Hostel may be a good advert for hotels as well as 90 minutes of well tooled disturbance. Hard to hate - especially when watched backwards.",5,1,1,27 March 2006
Black Book," Schindler's Fist
","It's the counter factual rambling of movie loving drunk; what if Paul Verhoven, the dutch director of such big-budget exploitation fare as Robocop and Showgirls, and not Hollywood master Steven Spielberg, had abandoned his commercial comfort zone to make Schindler's list Â– his personal war project? Though such a thing may seem more Verboten that Verhoven, it is nevertheless now a reality. The man who would have put an invisible rape into cinemas if the MPAA hadn't stopped him has returned to his homeland to front a $40M exploration of the Netherlands under Nazi occupation and if we're surprised that the result is so straight-laced, fans should know that the old pervert isn't going to let something as undignified as the conduct of the Dutch under occupation put the brakes on his pet obsessions of sex, nudity, bodily fluids and gratuitous violence.This, at least in the mind of the director, is the Basic Instinct helmer's think piece. You can rationalize this as the surrender to inverted snobbery. After all, Robocop is a thoughtful piece of work Â– no really Â– plenty to say about what being human actually means, the bleed of corrupt corporations into national institutions, etc.. but you don't win many plaudits for melting a man in a toxic waste dump or shooting a rapist in the groin. What gets you credibility, particularly if you're Paul Verhoven Â– the only man to collect his Razzie, is something a bit more worthy and that means historical drama with European backers.The return to Holland was rationalized by PV as essential for the film's dramatic and tonal authenticity Â– a European cast adding a polyglot polish to a impressively mounted recreation of the occupied territory and to begin with it's a sober, carefully paced affair, detailing Carice van Houten's plight as a hidden Jew living with a Dutch family under an assumed identity. When the barn where she spends most of her time is bombed, her I.D card is discovered by the Germans and she accepts an offer for her and family to escape by boat to Belgium. Unfortunately, in the first of some pornographically realized sequences, the Germans are waiting for them and slaughter the family with close up machine gun fire, the girl narrowly escaping and subsequently joining the Dutch resistance to gain revenge on the Nazis.As it goes on however, Black Book's tone starts to feel a touch confused, the cinematic equivalent of a beaten wife trying to reconcile her love for her abusive husband. The script, co-written by Verhoven with Gerad Soeteman, is content to paint its plot in very broad strokes. It relies on a fair amount of contrivance and unusually for a film that has pretensions of seriousness, airport lounge novel plotting Â– the kind you'd expect in a Hollywood thriller but not in a film that has one beady eye on the non-English speaking European market. PVs time in the US has certainly given him ample opportunity to indulge in his love of excess and his time in America has left an indelible signature on his method. A certain amount of Hollywood blowback is evident here, so during some sequences, for example the scene in which the resistance attempt to free their captured comrades from a German base, it's almost like watching a Nazi version of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves only not quite as much fun.It's a strange fugue; yes that's right fugue, of continental fastidiousness and old fashioned pulp espionage plotting with the overall package not entirely satisfactory for either the Dutch destroyer's audience of gore whores and masturbators, or the subtitled set that might have expected something more subtle and less predictable.As befits a Verhoven picture, it's confidently realized and well staged stuff but as you might have expected, as subtle as a naked man in a girl's school. The Dutchman is no Spielberg and can't reign in his penchant for breasts and blood. It's widely known that squib making families eat for a year when Verhoven is in town and true to form the violence, through sporadic, is graphic and abruptly rendered. The sex too is vintage Verhoven, painted pubic hair, fondled mammaries and a great riff on the 'is that a gun in your pocket are you just happy to see me' line. None of this adds much to the story of course and only serves to highlight its lack of depth and the simplistic take on wartime morality and its complexities Â– the good German solider and the bad Dutch resistance fighter. There's probably a myriad of fascinating stories about such things but Verhoven may not be the man to tell them.They'll be letting James Cameron make a film about the Titanic disaster next!",5,7,15,16 May 2007
Batman Returns," 'Don't Bother!'
","Burton returns as well as Batman and in doing so abandons any pretence of real story telling in favour of a retro-expressionist exercise in psychological damaged character study. Even the production methodology replicates the old studio constructivism of pictures made in Germany's Weimar Republic and its clear that you're looking at a sound-stage the entire time which if anything just heightens the sense that you're occupying a complete fantasy world, superbly realised but lacking in the subtleties of plot that would have made it a more complete experience. As it is the visuals are stunning and its a more technically accomplished, more confidently directed picture than its predecessor but for all that it lacks the unpredictable edge of Jack Nicolson's Joker or the epic scope of Anton Furst's sets, here replaced by some accomplished design by Bo Welch. Its rare for a studio to give a director as much latitude as Burton got here but there's an argument to say that he ran too far with his own vision as the sacrifice of story and the creation of a film with such a dark and foreboding centre made him an easy scapegoat for the movie's apparent under-performance at the cash registers. Burton may have got his own way but his inability to properly balance the material and propensity to over-egg the pudding produced an ugly reaction in the studio, Joel Schumacher. A shame because Returns is a perfectly watchable, occasionally brilliant instalment, it just doesn't quite work as comic book entertainment.",6,0,1,19 June 2005
Hot Fuzz," Phwwooooaarrrr, Geek Porn!!!
","English quintessence is nothing if not the humble country village Â– that non-threatening, twee piece of rural idyll where everyone and everything has been unmoved by the monstrous engine of industrial and sociological change. In Britain, where programmes are commissioned for an imaginary constituency of women, old women and the very old who can't leave the house, such pastures have become of staple of popular drama, enlivened by the occasionally grim but statistically improbable murder. So what if they drag like sin, are 'gentle' to the point of coma and less slick than a camcorder movie made by a person with Parkinson's who broke the image stabiliser Â– there will always be an England and we must look at it whether we want to or not.Hot Fuzz is what happens when English people brought up on American Action blockbusters and buddy cop gunfests but lacking any manifest gun culture of their own, mine the very funny conceit of recasting a plodding Sunday tea time rural murder mystery as a Michael Bay-style actioner. A great idea because what could be further away from the world of Tony Scott, Bay and co than Gloustershire and the St. Mary Mead-esquire village green? Its been done before Â– the comic strip made two very funny 'action' versions of the fall of the GLC and the Miners Strike in the American mould, but those were parodies Â– Fuzz in contrast is more a valentine to the Bruckheimer stable, played for laughs but not the self-referential bore it might have been. That it has to be a movie in its own right is apparent from the off because the frantic, machine gun style of Wright would be hard to live with for two hours if there was no story per say, just the ticking of clichÃ© boxes. His crash zooms, whip pans and fitting camera operators are like someone shouting 'I WENT TO FILM SCHOOL' in your ear for 2 hours but it's a love for the b-movie form that puts a big silly grin all over your face. That said it's pure fan-boy masturbation, conflating everything from the Wicker Man to Straw Dogs along with numerous other movie and T.V references. It stays on the right side of affectionate however and rather than simply jumping in with exchanges of fire and explosions, the clever script builds the story to a point where you can suspend your disbelief long enough to enjoy the terrifically overwrought, 12 gauge climax. 30 minutes of pure joy which is impossible to describe without using the tired clichÃ© of 'its X meets Y' but that, in essence, is the formula for the whole movie.Wright's direction plugs the gap left by the relatively sparse sprinkling of jokes as its OTT hyperactivity is part of the gag and complimented perfectly by some ludicrously rat a tat tat editing. The kind that makes it look as though the editor was buggering the AVID. This, plus the likable leads and spate of intrusive cameos from jobbing comedians keeps things buoyant but in keeping with its parent pictures Â– Bad Boys 2 and the like Â– its too long and the second act though never dull, starts to draw attention to its length so that the final half hour acts as a welcome corrective. Pegg mentioned on T.V that length was a problem for these pictures but seemed to think 2 hours was the optimum running time for such things. As a geek brought up on Eighties genre flicks he should know that most were about 20 minutes shorter than that and for good reason Â– you set it up, do the minimum to get the denouement and get out. See Back to the Future's perfectly judged 100 odd minutes for a masterclass in how to do this. If it were made today it'd be 2 and half hours long Â– have we all gone crazy or have filmmakers just become more self-indulgent? There's just 100 minutes of good material here but if you can forgive the padding Hot Fuzz is nicely judged, slam bang entertainment. Wright is terrific but it would be interesting to see what a pure Edgar looked like by which I mean a picture he envisioned without an all night trawl through his DVD collection....good as it undoubtedly is.",7,1,3,27 February 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Dead in the water
","Mark Kermode memorably described Dead Man's Chest Â– the bloated and ever so slightly creaky sequel to the 2003 Johnny Depp jokefest as the 'death of Western civilisation'. That kind of criticism is ridiculous of course, the second Pirates movie was far worse than that, but assuming he judged the scale of the artistic degeneracy correctly, At World's End is just that Â– the end of the friggin' world.It's fair to say that the original film was far better than an adaptation of a theme park ride had any right to be, though the script for Alton Tower's ghost train is rumoured to be incredible Â– apparently Robert Towne's greatest since Chinatown. Its pantomime humour and breezy swashbuckling plot felt like a fresh wind blowing through a room of soul crushing sequels. Johnny Depp hammed it up and somehow captured the admiration of the entire world; the world showcasing its egregious taste in the process. An Oscar nomination followed, that's right an Oscar nomination for Christ's sake, which thankfully didn't translate to a win but nevertheless seemed, like the box office, out of all proportion to the quality of the film that had been made. It was not too bad, overlong and an intermittently exciting affair. Orlando Bland and Kiera Knightley provided the good looks and teeth but characterisation was a plush bounty that remained hidden and on the evidence that made it into cinemas, safe from seeking filmmakers.Disney couldn't quite believe how much it had made, which made two of us and sticking to the business model now well established in light of Back to the Future and the Matrix, two sequels were green lit to be made back to back to maximise the potential box office and allow two visits to the well while the series was still popular.So, inevitably the tonic to those summer sequels of many a year ago is now responsible for summer sequels of its own. Talk about irony sitting on your face without invitation and jostling from side to side.The problem with making two sequels back to back is that the temptation, so far irresistible to the 'creatives' at the helm, is to make one long film and split it in two. This way you give the audience an incentive to return for the second sequel, effectively locking them into it. It's a bad move, principally because the second film is inevitably open ended and the third, lacking a self-contained plot, begins abruptly and relies on the audience's foreknowledge of characters and incident to work. Artistically you may think it would be better to make two self-contained movies with their own resolved story lines Â– perhaps the merest hint of a joining plot thread deftly inserted to act as that cliffhanger. Well, wouldn't you? But Disney didn't do that and so at World's end begins where the old film left off with all manor of plot threads bleeding in from the previous movie. The finished film just sort of meanders along, joining up the characters, then splitting them up, then uniting them again while contrivance buggers incident follows setpiece and repeats en route to the show stopping conclusion. It's so long that when the certificate came up I'm pretty sure there were real pirates still on the high seas and that the cinema I was sitting in was just the lunatic daydream of an old seadog, albeit a seadog with an extraordinary scientific imagination.Initially it seems as if the middle tenet of a pirate's life Â– rum, sodomy and the lash, is missing from the series all together but as the third part went on you realised it was there alright, just symbolically afflicting the audience. Did Verbinski have his script and film editor killed? On this evidence someone should be looking into it. A DVD of this would surely be enough to send Gore to the gallows.One area that should be praised however, is ILM's special effects which are simply superb and occasionally, and somewhat impressively in this era of CGI saturated boredom, genuinely exciting to look at. The film's climax, which comes sometime during the movie's 15th hour, is a triumph of computer animation and pyrotechnic excess. The sheer all consuming nature of it and the pace at which every digitally stuffed frame is cut together, is the right side of breathtaking and yes, a ship cannoned to destruction in slow motion as it's captain walks down her stairs may be pure Bruckheimer balls-out action porn but that wood shattering goodness is stunning to look at. It goes on for a long long time certainly, in fact I dropped my popcorn during the third act because of the onset of acute arthritis, but in the absence of wit, economic plotting or a real story it's by far the best reason to see this groaning behemoth drag itself over 168 waterlogged minutes.Ironically unlikely to be affected too much by online piracy Â– it made a shocking $401M around the stupid world over it's first weekend Â– the third Pirate's film stretches one pantomime turn across three movies, one of them okay, and in doing so shows that deprivation of quality in all other departments, bar those effects people of course, is no barrier to success on an earth shattering scale. It may not be a good advertisement for cinema but many, Michael Bay for one, will have slept better once they'd seen the film and taken in the figures, while others like old school blockbuster veterans Spielberg and Zemeckis will wonder why they ever bothered in the first place. The storytelling values of 40's and 70's Hollywood are as much under threat as Depp's pirates but unlike Sparrow and crew, it's no laughing matter.",5,2,4,30 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Hype creep
","You may have missed it but something extraordinary happened recently. Perhaps you were busy romancing your best friend's girlfriend, drowning the kittens of your partner's grotesque children in the canal or like me, trying to remove an entire layer of fatty tissue from your bath tub after the acid had drained out but over in America, punters paid $148M to see Spider-man 3. That's nearly 5 pounds sterling.What made them do it? Well it wasn't coherence, good writing or sharp plotting but we can assume millions of dollars worth of marketing played their part. A popular character, two reasonably entertaining and well judged films and the kind of brand recognition that would make Coke envious, all fed into the pre-summer hype and when there's that much anticipation amongst the young and the socially stunted these things have a habit of becoming a self-fulfilling prophesy. It's just a pity that the movie itself isn't very good.Its fascinating, you might think and even if you wouldn't I would, that parents are a great deal more relaxed about entertainment than other confected consumables. Spider-man is the ultimate corporate movie making exercise and the big spiders forced to pay for their egg sack progeny to watch the bloody thing, see it all as harmless, if juvenile fun. It'd be a real killjoy that berated people for enjoying this sort of thing wouldn't it? And with that in mind, on we go.The thing is you see legions of kids, accompanied by well meaning but unconsciously hypocritical parents, lap it up like maggots to human remains. These are the same people who won't let their kids eat anything that isn't organically produced and spend hours examining packaging in supermarkets for additives. Imagine for a moment that they applied the same standard to movies. Lactating mothers whose husbands work in the city all day and didn't know they were ever pregnant, let alone looking after their 3 children, would accost miserable cinema staff and ask them things like 'has this film been written by a single individual nurturing his own idea and is the story true to the principles of creative film-making, nurtured by independently minded professionals and funded with the profits from art house festivals?' If the poor sod said no then Mum would take her offspring elsewhere, looking for wholesome, and intellectually nourishing entertainment. But we don't think this way of course and so consequently our offspring get force fed a sickly sweet diet of confected glop like 'ol Spidey here. Okay, says Sony's marketing department, the script is Sam Rami's vision of the arachnid super-hero but you only have to watch the new film to see the tension between commercial interest and the auteur imperative and you better believe the latter always gets snuffed out when there's a budget of $258M involved.What's so depressing about Spider-man 3 is how synthetic is actually feels. It's a demographically minded, committee made 140 minutes with numerous plot strands all jockeying for attention, amidst some admittedly impressive special effects and a truckle of characters, none of whom have any time or space to develop in any satisfactory manor. Every moment is calculated with such cynicism that it's almost impossible not to feel embarrassed watching it flaunt its crowd pleasing conventions. They're well worn certainly, but we keep coming back for them like a sadist making a homeless man dance for his pleasure for the price of some cigarettes and a subway meatball sandwich. You know its self-destructive but you can't help yourself.What works is mainly held over from previous films, which means it's extended into this one without being developed further. Maguire still doesn't have any descent quips but he's reasonably endearing if too bug eyed by half as the hero and Dunst still has a sweetness about her but the sentimental etchings of her failing relationship with Tobey, vomited into the proceedings, is enough to turn an unfocused script into pure flab in some places. You'd think a man who could ejaculate through his wrists would be interesting enough not to have girl trouble but true to her sex, Dunst is never satisfied.Reversing a good decision from previous Spider-mans, this one has too many villains and subsequently can't give them room to develop. Thomas Haden Church is wasted as Sandman, having nothing to do but morph into a sandstorm and the film's promised 'battle from within' following Peter Parker's infection with an alien parasite, turns him from an irritating but hubristic do gooder into a bit of a sticky tosser who dresses like Gomez Addams and does poor impressions of John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. Based on this evidence half the clubbers in Britain have been exposed to venom and before you rush out, that isn't a new name for an old venereal diseaseÂ…though if you're concerned you've probably got that too.Cluttered and lacking the, er, intelligence of previous outings, Spider-man 3 is big, well dressed multiplex fodder but is in turn both childish and sugary enough to be fairly disappointing overall. Rami's screenplay is pretty dreadful so a bit of the old directorial bravado might have helped but these days the man who used to run his work through with wit and vigor behind the camera is content to point and click, leaving the real work to the effects artists. Fine but don't be surprised if you find yourself as undernourished as a kid who survives on sweets and soft drinks alone. Your Mum would have told you these things were bad for you but she was busy buying the tickets and stocking up on the popcorn.Glazed with cash but bland as butter.",5,2,5,14 May 2007
Match Point," 'You cannot be serious'
","Woody Allen relocates to London but based on this evidence, he wrote the screenplay on the plane. Had he waited until landing and spent a little time in good 'ol Londoninium, he might had the chance to listen to how we speak over here. As it is you've got a movie with some of the most stilted, turgidly written and, curiously for Allen, witless dialogue you'll ever hear and absolute murder on the ears for real Londoners. Allen (Daddy to his wife) has always rolled naked in language like a sunbathing hippo in mud but the wordy script, stuffed into the misshapen mouths of 'the English upper class' is awkwardly spewed out over two hours, more you suspect out of reverence to the director who no-one wanted to offend with a factual denunciation of its sheer wooden quality, so the cast look stagestruck - a group of people lifelessly reciting their lines like schoolchildren forced to read Shakespeare out loud in class. You've never heard anyone speak the way these people do - okay this is what used to be known as the Ruling class and they're an odd bunch as we know but do they really talk like the King addressing the nation on BBC radio circa 1935? The casting of Myers is also unusual. We're asked to believe that this cut-glass Englishman is in fact a poor Irishman who's pulled himself up through his Tennis skills. Woody Allen himself sounds more Irish than Reece-Myers. Occasionally Match Point engages. As the affair between Myers and Johansson deepens so does the material but as it all pans out the twists in the story become signposted far in advance and it progressively becomes less plausible until finally, with Johansson murdered and Myers looking as though he'll get away with it, Allen strays into an middling episode of Columbo but without the great man himself to pick apart the killer's poorly conceived plot. Its also in the denouement that Allen's misogyny rears its ugly, lecherous head. Johanson, like all women in these situations, pays for her intense sexuality that turned the poor mans head and potentially wrecked his marriage, with her life. Never mind that unlike say Glen Close in Fatal Attraction, she was groomed by the man in question and harassed until she gave in and who cares if Myers has lied to all parties throughout and acted with ruthless self-interest - he's a man and more importantly the Allen surrogate so its inconceivable that he'll be hauled into a police van by the hapless Rozzers and given a life sentence at Parkhurst. That audiences tend to sympathise with the men in these situations, some women mystifyingly included, is one of the great psychological conundrums of the cinematic experience. As I left the cinema in fact I heard two teenage girls ruminating on the fact that the genetically gifted Myers had got away it and saying that they were 'glad, weren't you?' Well no I wasn't - having sat through two hours of conversations with the new English who use phrases like 'schmuk' and 'I figured', I had hoped for at least the sight of Myers being lead to the gallows. So Match Point is a movie that oscillates between poorly performed melodrama and jaw-on-the-floor implausibility. The one moment that really is an ace is the scene in which Myers throws an incriminating ring into the Thames only for it to hit the rail and bounce back onto the pavement. The same action with the ball in Tennis would have Myers lose the point but ironically here it has the opposite effect as it's discovered by a drug addict who is later fingered for the Tennis Pro's spate of murders. The message is clear - sometimes what's generally accepted as wrong can, with a bit of luck, work to your advantage. One thinks of Woody and his young bride and shudders. Lucky for Mia Farrow the director doesn't own a rifle.",6,3,12,15 January 2006
Zodiac," An open letter to IMDb readers from Zodiac
","There I was, the most incisive, quotable, culturally literate review I'd ever written Â– just sitting there on my desktop, awaiting internet publication Â– a review so good it was almost a religious experience and what happens? I get a letter from my old friend the Zodiac killer whom having seen the David Fincher film based on his case, felt compelled (as he inevitably does) to write what he thought of it and would I mind posting the text of his letter instead? Normally I'd have told him to go and shoot some teenagers but he let me advertise for a room mate on his myspace once soÂ… An open letter to IMDb readers from Zodiac Hello David, this is the Zodiac.Did you see it? I suppose you must have by now. You better have made an attempt for your sake and not, as you threatened to do, go and see that Pirates of the Caribbean crap. Looks like I won our little wager but it's like I told you Â– if you want a movie made about you you'll either have do something important or do what I did and murder some young people (and one idiot cab driver, though to be fair they're sort of okay as they're always overcharging people anyway Â– I mean, $6 for a $3 fare? You know he deserved it).So last night, after what seemed like an eternity, I finally got time off to go to the Castro Theater and see Zodiac, the long overdue film about me. I mean what took them so long for Christ's sake? I don't want to hear about Dirty Harry, I mean, sure, good movie and I loved the girl in a hole stuff Â– wish I'd thought of it, but Andy Robinson was such a flake. Getting caught so easily and laughing like a pervert. That's supposed to be me? If murder wasn't a capital crime I'd have sued their asses clean off.So anyway, the Fincher movie isn't too bad. #$%****() Â– there you go, pick the bones out of that. Did I confound your analogue mind? I've got a books worth of these. So yeah, It was pretty good, took me right back to the glory days Â– lots of great period detail and that pig Toschi was just like I imagined him Â– absolutely clueless. Well I say clueless, he did interview me but you don't get arrested for sweating like a rapist and licking your lips every time a murder is mentioned. Incidentally that was a shock to me too.&&**((%^#. Any ideas? You don't have a clue do you? Its important to have a USP if you're planning on being a serial murderer, people forget that and that's why in the league of psychotic media folk legends I'm still in top five, though Jack the Ripper is always going to be no.1 and overrated for the same reason as the Beatles will always supersede the Stones Â– history never forgives you if you go on too long.Gore Verbinski take note.Even though I wasn't in Zodiac as much as I would of liked I still enjoyed the stuff about bird brain Avery and that geek Graysmith, to whom I'd have paid a visit if he didn't live on the other side of town and it wasn't two buses. It's certainly ironic that I killed several people and slept pretty well at night, sometimes better because of what I did and these guys fell apart and got all obsessive. And they didn't even shoot anyone! Merely slaves in my world. Watching Avery, as played by Downley Jnr, stuffing popcorn into my mouth was all I could not to laugh. I suppose you noticed (and would have droned on about) the recurring time motif in the movie? I named myself after a watch, time is always referenced, the search for me goes on across decades, etcÂ… Loved that 'time lapse' scene with the Transamerica pyramid Â– isn't it incredible what they can do these days? Yeah, my work certainly did burn up those pigs lives.Also, did you notice how Fincher took a celluloid swing at me by flouting thriller conventions? I'll bet you did you geeky freak. I love the movies, this is well known and the one I dreamt about, involving myself, had more gore and just focused on how good I was, particularly toward the end when the pigs gave up and I laughed at their embarrassment. You saw Seven, right? That was my movie in all but name. So having waited all these years I finally get the film of my life and it isn't about me at all, plus it doesn't even stick to the formula of these things. Why wasn't Graysmith psychologically connected to me in some way and where was the climax? John Doe got a head in a box and I get a photo I.D in an airport? Man, I couldn't have killed enough people.&*#$$%!^. See what I did there? Of course you didn't you servile camel jacker.By the way, are we still on for Wedding Daze?",7,1,2,29 May 2007
Cloverfield," The geist in the machine.
","Something is happening in escapist genre film-making, can you feel it? My zeitgeist gland started to vomit chemical nausea into my body twice recently and the reasons are obvious Â– like you my friend. It's this notion that escapist genre fare is starting to appropriate the language of cultural trauma in order to entertain us and a new kind of blockbuster is the by-product Â– a style in its infancy that is flirting with immorality. This is the kind of flirting that unchecked can lead to a violation of the audience and what it understands to be normal in terms of how it should get it rocks off. Be careful says I because like a dirty old uncle that whips out the little gentleman for his unsuspecting niece, the consequences are a potential warping of what we consider to be harmless fun Â– something David Director and Sidney Scribe must ultimately take responsibility for.Rambo was at it recently, hijacking Spielberg's D-Day realism approach from Saving Private Ryan to murder the Burmese Militia. In Spielberg's film the technique had been used to strip warfare of its Technicolor entertainment value and give the battle scenes an unsentimental air of reportage. Stallone reversed this idea by applying the same tools to sate the blood lust of his seen it all before ghoulish adolescent audience Â– a corruption of the original style. What used to be fun about genre movies with high death rates and judicious dollops of wanton destruction is that it was escapism Â– larger than life, utterly ridiculous and therefore completely safe to enjoy.Cloverfield may be a better film than Rambo but it uses the same methodology to get it jollies. Here its 9/11 that gets plundered to add an uncomfortable real world sensibility to the old monster on the rampage movie. Filmed from the perspective of a single camcorder, events unfold in fits and shaky hand held starts with the beast periodically glimpsed whenever the terrified documentarian gets the chance. The characters aren't up to much and are irrelevant in any event but their panic feels genuine enough and its in these scenes of fleeing, glancing upward to see a building topple and the like that dÃ©jÃ  vu hits you in a very unpleasant way. One scene in particular Â– the collapse of a apartment block and the unfolding dust cloud is a direct lift from Al-Queda's greatest hits. This of course is a very effective device to make something absurd genuinely mortifying but when popular entertainment starts to play on its audience's real fears by appealing to direct experience rather than the base instincts that traditionally were its bread and butter (you didn't need to have seen real footage of a shark eat a man to buy into Jaws Â– the premise was primal in its efficacy) then arguably a line has been crossed. There's no doubting the filmmakers exploitative glee here or the skill in which the enveloping disaster is juxtaposed with the couple's day out recorded on the same tape and occasionally 'cut' to in the gaps in recording, to produce emotional punch but there's an air of cynicism about the execution. Fun doesn't seem well, fun any more.",6,2,4,2 March 2008
Silent Hill," Memorise this: up, sidestep, turn, exit, forget.
","Christopher Gans: Sounds a bit like glands and its a synonym for that part of the male reproductive organ that could be a nickname for you if you gained any satisfaction from this pointless bit of game-whoring. Silent Hill the movie is a dead ringer for the video game except that you can't join in and therefore don't have a chance of getting involved. I've watched Mrs Frames play it many times and then, as now, I watched a girl run around a ghostly town over which atmosphere and the creeps had ejaculated to high volume. The problem with the film is that it offers no more depth because it absences plot and characterisation. These would be vital additions to any game to movie transfer because without them you've got a lose series of set pieces linked by a lot of running but sans, or should that be Gans, any emotional or cerebral involvement. Roger Avary who touched greatness with Pulp Fiction and then horribly relaxed, turns in a two hour gaming sample ripped from the screen of his PS2. What he fails to do is add anything to the mix. The acting such as it is doesn't convince because there's nothing for the cast to latch on to; Sean Bean's Sheffield-American accent being the only unintentionally amusing strand. It looks good - engenders dread in many places but as a piece of storytelling its pure bunk. Surely it doesn't take a genius to work out that gamers fill in the blanks themselves through the act of participation in these things. They make the story. When you can't pick up a controller and join in you need a script writer to flesh it out for you and sadly for Silent Hill thats exactly what no-one thought to do. Whats next, Outrun the movie? Enough is enough surely.",4,1,5,28 April 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Bears, Snares and the Final Shabang
","Your best friend has been frozen in intergalactic concrete, you begin to suspect that girl you really liked and sexual fantasied about might be a relation, the most evil man in the universe has confessed he's your Dad just as you were getting ready to kill him, you've lost a limb and worst of all you're been pressured to take over the family business which would be fine were it not for the fact that this means the enslavement and oppression of the entire galaxy. Yes, Welcome to Return of the Jedi - the episode where Luke starts to dress like a guest at a wake and nearly gets eaten by an unconvincing stop motion animated monster.It all looked very bleak for Luke and company at the end of EMPIRE, and now its looking like game over as the Empire build a second Death Star, a moon sized can of whoop-ass. Return of the Jedi also sees the return of the incredible stupidity with which they quite reasonably had become associated, only this time its the Empire's turn to leave their brains at the door. Hedging his bets in a big way, the Emperor (Ian McDarmid), decides the easiest way to wipe out the rebellion is to tell them where the new Death Star is, how to destroy it and where they can disable its protective shield. The plan hinges on the ability to the Imperial forces to wipe out the rebel fleet. So why is he so confident? A look at history should have given all concerned a bad feeling about this. These are the troops that a hundred strong can't lay a single hit on an untrained boy and a taped down 19 year girl (A New Hope), these are the star-destroyers that can't capture a single ship (Empire Strikes Back) and hang on, aren't these the same Imperial forces that lost the original Death Star to a farmer with a penchant for bombing womprats 'in the caverns back home'? It all looks like a cock up of epic proportions and sure enough it is only this time the Empire is up against forces even more sinister than girls, farmers or old men... Say Hello to the Ewoks - Teddy Bears armed with sticks, rocks and swing ropes. An Empire this damn unprepared doesn't deserve to survive so their end must be a welcome relief for them as well as us. Admiral Needa certainly looks as if hes had enough.Jedi is a feel good conclusion to the original trilogy but isn't as tight as its predecessor. Before we can get into the meat of the plot they're is unresolved business with Jabba the Hut to get through. Thus the first 40 minutes of Jedi looks like an explosion in a puppet factory as Lucas and puppet director Marquand (bullied and undermined throughout apparently) opt for a child friendly environment at the expense of a harder edge, with one eye firmly on the cash tills. Blue Elephants, bletching alien frogs and a horrid creature that laughs like an evil old woman provide the 'menace', while Luke's rendezvous with the Rancor will scare all those who can stop laughing for long enough to watch.Once thats out of the way the story moves to Redeeming Anakin Skywalker/Vader, destroying the Emperor and camping in the forests of Endor. Lucas returns to his favourite theme of the a high tech enemy being overwhelmed and defeated by a low tech, god faring opposition (was he on the American's side in Vietnam I wonder?). Fans looking for the dark character dynamics of the previous episode have to wade through a lot of kiddie friendly cuteoids (its a word now, OK?), almost compensated for by MacDarmid's terrific turn as the Emperor. Vader's redemption seems a bit forced with the benefit of hindsight, taking just an hour of screen time, a bit of amateur reverse psychology from Luke and the sons impending death to reverse years of ingrained evil doing. There are precious new elements to the story too thanks to the decision to stick with the original climax despite it having been already used in Episode IV. So alls well that ends well and its good to know that despite having been complicit in the death of millions and being a right bastard for most of his life, killing the Emperor and saying sorry was all that was needed to join the happy glow-lucky Jedi afterlife.Gives us all new hope doesn't it?*Some notes on the 1997 Special Edition*The pit of carcoon looks a bit like Audrey II from Little shop of Horrors thanks to some ill advised digital additions and the musical number that Lucas thought 'might be funny' in the middle of a Star Wars film, isn't. We all know what George's sense of humour can produce - the likes of Jar Jar Binks. The nights must fly by in the Lucas household. The extended finale works quite nicely, tieing the film to the prequel trilogy and makes for a more universally satisfactory conclusion. This is one film however that looks set to be in a constant state of revision. At time of writing in 2003 there are reports that Lucas is planning further additions, such as scenes of Padme being pasted in (during the Luke/Leia conversation perhaps?). Fine George, just don't add the prefix 'Indiana Jones and the...' to the title OK?",7,1,2,24 June 2003
Pan's Labyrinth," A-Maze-ing
","I'm not sure why it's called Pan's Labyrinth in the English translation because I'm fairly sure that the Faun never refers to himself by name or is referred to by name throughout the running time but the real mystery surrounding Del Toro's fantasy is why is engages in the cinema, stays with you afterwards but still leaves you cold.Its certainly not for want of creative energy. This is a rich and unusual enterprise, occasionally hauntingly beautiful, a bit like the corpse of a stunning 20 year old who's died from electrocution and lies tantalisingly inert on the mortician's slab. Obsentisably its a Spanish civil war drama with a liberal sprinkling of fairy dust, horrific in its real world setting, baroque and artistic in Ofelia's fantasy realm. But Pan's Labyrinth has problems beneath its carefully layered visuals. The two halves marry successfully but to no real end. The opening scenes promise a more substantial payoff but instead its a fascinating but ultimately hollow piece about childhood escapism. That the fantasy is real as the narrative suggests hardly matters in the end as its had such a negligible impact on the non-magical world.Alluring, well made and often captivating, you should see it, just know that the real magic is that you won't notice the lack of dramatic integrity until its all over...but you will notice.",7,2,4,28 November 2006
Rocky II," Round 2!
","A remake really, in which Rocky goes back to the ghetto to warm applause and Apollo Creed goes back to his mansion only to be horrified by the suggestion that, contrary to his feelings on the night, he had in fact been beaten in all but name by the big bag of muscles from the slums. The champion's vanity would shame Narcissus and he rationalises that Rocky's 15 round slog was a bit of a fluke, after all this is a man with an I.Q so low that only someone with Aspurger's syndrome can calculate all the decimals. If he can get him back in the ring for a rematch this should become obvious to everyone. That's everyone except us of course who could tell Creed he was setting himself up to be less Apollo 11, more 13 but nevertheless the stage is set for yet enough climatic confrontation. As we've already seen most of this movie in the first instalment it's only necessary for Stallone to make some minor modifications. His wife gives birth but goes into a coma prompting Rocky to lose his focus on the fight. Mickey reassures him by saying things like 'You're gonna get KILLED' while Creed pumps iron and laughs off suggestions that he may be making a mistake, and so on and so on... Eventually we do get to the juice as Adrian wakes up and tells Rocky that for the benefit of the film she'll drop her objections and let him fight. At this stage all thats left is for that fanfare to come on, Rocky to play chase with some kids from the neighbourhood and the throttling of some poor chicken and we're off! The second film lacks the freshness of the first but it's still easily digestible entertainment. As its unthinkable that Rocky could loose THIS time there's also the inevitable win to look forward to and although hardly a tour de force from a directorial point of view, Stallone does at least acquit himself well in the staging of the fight scenes and shows sufficient acumen in pushing the right audience buttons. Not a knockout then but at least a 6 count.",6,1,3,6 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Force yourself
","Attack of the Clones had the unenviable distinction of being not so much the prequel to Star Wars but the sequel to the Phantom Menace. If movies were people this would be like finding out you were Hitler's nephew or worse, Charlton Heston's son. Menace achieved a lot, namely what many thought impossible; permanently sapping the lustre from what was an almost universally adored series. If the sparkle was to return to those stars this had to first class, grade A, top of the class stuff. Any reminder of its predecessor beyond the bare bones of plot continuity were therefore wise to avoid at all costs. Clones partially succeeds in restoring some pride to the series. Structually its better than its predecessor, the plot more straightforward and less marred by political spiel than before. However, this can't hide its wider failings. Just as before, none of the newer characters fail to make any impact. There's no Han Solo or Luke to offer us the simple pleasures of before. Padme no longer speaks with a lifeless monotone and could almost pass for a real human being. Binks, reviled by the entire universe has a greatly reduced role. Lucas puts two fingers up at those who maligned his 'comic' creation, i.e. everyone and ensures Jar Jar is central to a key plot point thus justifying his existence in the series. He'll claim it was planned that way all along of course but you don't need to be a Jedi to work out this is the cine-equivalent of the spoilt child who has to have the last word in an argument. It was still WRONG George, I don't care if the Gungan menace killed the Emperor himself. The central flaw in Clones is the relationship that should be its (and the series) emotional core, namely the relationship between Anakin and Padme. From the outset this is doomed on screen because of the casting of Hayden Christensen. His performance is so wooden and devoid of credibility that you might as well have hired the Gaffer's son and got him to read out the lines. We're asked to believe that this dull and stroppy teen will one day be the most feared man in the universe. So why does Padme fall in love with the little upstart? Lucas's script offers no clues. Anakin's diatribe on the failings of democracy should be enough to alarm any potential suteur but Padmes hardly bats an eyelid. She gets a another chance later after Anakin slaughters an entire tribe of Tusken Raiders but do any bulbs go off? Not a bit of it. Having proclaimed his murder of women and children the feckless former Monarch gives him a supportive hug! The problems of being attracted to a would-be fascist and murderer are offset, Lucas suggests, by the fact that Skywalker is good at rolling around in grass and making fruit float in the air, thus showcasing his playful qualities. We're left concluding that the most important couple in the galaxy came together because Padme is a sucker for a pretty face. Cynics may point to some evidence of misogyny here but in Lucas' defence this is the man who championed the role of women by putting Princess Leia in that slave girl two-piece. In any event Padme deserves everything she gets. Does the rest of the story fare any better? Sadly not. Obi Wan's journey to Kimino to visit a clone factory pushes story credibility to the limit. No one seems very alarmed by the prospect of entire army having being created in secret. Why should they you ask, the Jedi are in charge right? Wrong. Having being captured by Count Dooku the hapless Jedi is TOLD that Palpatine is the Emperor but dismisses it as dark side deception. Does no one think to check it out? Of course not and consequently only Yoda shows any common sense, only neglecting to mention his kidnap and replacement by a terrible puppet around the time of Menace. We're also treated to some moments of unintentional hilarity. Titter ye not at the Anakin blow job scene, and if you're watching toward the end try not to laugh when Yoda fights Dooku which looks like the Sith lord is trying to swat a giant fly. In contrast all the real jokes fail flat mostly, C3P0 the worst offender with some truly awful sub-Graham Norton punning that will make you wish you could disconnect your own head. Only Ewan McGregor in a more relaxed performance gets a good bit of deadpanning in with his caustic 'to get a drink' response to Anakin's 'where are you going?' question. So the romance is rushed and insubstantial - laced with some of the worst dialogue you'll hear in any language ('A litter piece of me dies each day', yuk), and the Clone story fails to ignite due to lapses in plot logic and some flat delivery by the leads. On the plus side there are some nice set-pieces, though a little too cartoony is places, and a few crowd pleasing moments. All in all this is a better than before but not yet near the level set by the original trilogy. With only one film left to go there is a hell of a lot to be done (as well as a hell of lot of plot to get through) if this trilogy is to save face. Despite some attempts to improve, this is still the longest expositionary picture ever made. Skip it and watch the 2 minute scene in the original describing this period instead. Its over sooner and tells you all you need to know, namely very little.",5,0,1,13 June 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," Fantasy Island
","Want to know what its like to live in England? Ask Richard Curtis. Hes always on hand to paint a picture of London life as imagined stateside - a London where everyone is middle class, has eccentric friends who are frightfully naughty because they swear a bit - where the ever so slightly repressed English handle sex with a mixture of crude embarrassment and the odd 'outrageous' outburst and a London in which it always snows at Christmas. If reality was half this middle of the road we might all kill ourselves with two and half big neurofens to a large glass of Chardonnay but thankfully this version of my fair city only exists in the mind of the Chelsea set and the Oxbridge media cult. Women love Bridget Jones of course, shes one of them you see. She worries about being fat, drinks too much, gets screwed over by men all the time (they ARE bastards aren't they?) and is prone to getting squiffy and making a fool of herself. A comfortable caricature for a lot of people I'm sure and lets be honest, if you identify with Bridget then its odds on that you've never held an original thought in your life. I'll bet you drink Pinot Grigo at pubs, are currently on a fad diet, have a fitness video hosted by an ex-Big Brother contestant and read Heat magazine. OK, you may say, what's wrong with a light bit of fairytale entertainment? Well nothing except that it seems to be the only kind of national representation that has any hope of being made these days and it gets on my bloody nerves. Also, would it be possible for an English lead to be played by, wait for it, an Englishwoman? Its bad enough that we've got to watch ourselves being parodied but surely to God we don't have to be impersonated as well? Incidentally, and I don't wish to offend anyone...which obviously isn't true but stick with it, there's nothing remotely funny about being the sort of Cosmo reading, ever so slightly kooky girl depicted here - if this is you, sit down and have a rethink tonight - life's too short to be a clichÃ©.",5,1,3,25 July 2005
Watchmen," Less is Moore
","Alan Moore's beef with Hollywood is that it's a crudifying monster Â– its arms entering the spectator's mind through the eyes and once inserted, frenzied and aimless, pulping the grey matter contents into a kind of wit resistant batter which is no more capable of processing the dense psychological and social preoccupations of his work than wood can hope to ferry electricity.For Moore, willfully ignorant in an effort to protect his own authorship, cinema just isn't up to it. The detail of each panel within the humble comic book is a gallery of ideas and story specific detail that you, yes YOU the grateful reader, pore over at your leisure, like the fine art connoisseur plotting their time through a superb exhibition and breathing in each piece in turn. This notion that film, by its very nature, is reductive in translation and confected on delivery, has lead the co-author of Watchmen to suggest that his 1986 graphic novel was 'unfilmable'. For the record, that's senseless toss but this adaptation isn't going to change his mind. It's not the mode of translation that's at fault Â– film is a perfectly viable tool for the job, it's the way that tool has been used.Watchmen is a fascinating view because it vividly illustrates several of the problems transferring material between two visual art forms that rely on significantly different patterns of consumption and interpretation to work.Dave Gibbons, who illustrated the 12-part series on which this is based, was, unlike Moore, happy to be credited and that's hardly surprising because Zack Snyder has used his art work like a storyboard, compensating for the rapidity of the moving image where appropriate, with fits of slow motion, designed to recall the experience of forensically eyeballing those all important panels. It is, superficially at least, a good technique, reverent to the original and designed to fluff the fanboys who will have envisioned it thus and will be in a furious masturbatory frisson as a result. Were this the only barometer, Watchmen would be a qualified success but its problems are manifest in those areas that required an artist rather than the fan at the helm Â– a director rather than a acolyte - narrative, backstory, tone; the elements of the graphic novel that, somewhat counter intuitively, may have benefited from a less straitjacketed approach.Watchmen the graphic novel acknowledges the limitations of the medium, whether it knows it or not, by fortifying each part with written extracts from various fictional sources Â– a former super heroes autobiography, a police report, a magazine article Â– all of which add texture to the characterization and flesh out the stories alternative timeline. Inevitably the three act Hollywood picture isn't the easiest framework within which to add these deets, so what to do? Ã‰migrÃ© directors of the 30s and 40s working in Hollywood (and a few of the natives), overcame these sorts of problems by investing scenes with expressionistic composition and shadow, which married with incisive, witty dialogue, hinted at what couldn't be shown or seen, and consequently your imagination became the bridge and added the depth. The result? Film Noir Â– the perfect fusion of artistry and suggestion and some of the finest American films ever made.Snyder knows he has a problem in this respect but sentimentally in thrall to the source, is incapable of making the decisions that might have saved his bacon. It's a matter of hitting the same psychological points in the story but with greater subtlety than a word for word transfer allows. Much of the dialogue is lifted from Moore's script, but what works within the context of the comic book, feels clunky and coarse when it exits the mouths of real human beings. Rorschach is the case in point. On paper he's brooding, introspective and psychotic Â– on screen he speaks the same words, does the same things but has a pantomime quality that errs toward the ridiculous. Too often, when unable to mark out his roadmap to the story's political and socio-satirical cues, Snyder's instinct is to go for crunching violence and spectacle (as well as adding inches to Doctor Manhattan's flaccid penis Â–not a bad metaphor for his approach), perhaps hoping to overpower the viewer's undernourished cerebellum. He'll say the noise is all on the page of course, and it is, but what felt cutting in the novel's more fully realised world, looks like a blunt instrument on screen. It isn't that you can't film it, you just can't do like this, but it's another case study to add to the files on the issue of how the filmmakers best equipped to replicate the EXPERIENCE of these stories, are seldom the ones who actually have an interest in doing so.",6,1,3,8 March 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," Permanent and Fatal Errors
","In the Matrix Revolutions I found a cine-surrogate for a man with whom I once had the misfortune of discussing Reloaded during the summer. He didn't understand it fully of course but he had plenty to say about it, oh yes, it was profound but he wasn't sure why and despite proclaiming most of the people who'd disliked it were probably 'stupid', he managed to deliver a soliloquy on the story full of ideas which said absolutely nothing. Revolutions conception echoes this wholly-thinking, empty headed idolatry with pixel perfect precision.A film about the death of humanity, it ironically lacks the same with lifeless characterisation perhaps modelled more on your common domestic appliances than any real person. Despite all the talk of the forthcoming apocalypse I found myself rooting for the sentinels and Monica Belluci's cleavage, wondering why you'd want to survive in a world so tortuously bleak that it may be likened to living in Iceland all year round - where culture is so soul crushingly fatalist that the only topics ripe for discussion are death and metaphysics. OK, its wartime but the inhabitants of Zion who don't even enjoy a municipal shopping arcade or a local radio station must feel like they've been living through the blitz except thats its lasted 100 years! Worst of all heres a city where God, Neo-help us may or may not be Keeanu f'ing Reeves - a man with less emotional range than a sentinel with a stroke. You have to admire their will to fight in the face of such monumental obstacles especially in light of the catch-22 that characterises their predicament. Live in the real world and you've got death and an industrial eyesore to look forward to, get plugged back in and you may be bored to death listening to people who either witter on about the meaning of choice or worse find they're prone to making statements like 'what just happened could not have happened any other way' or 'she'll kill us all, shes in love!' Please Trinity, go ahead - SHOOT, i'm ready.The original films infusion of high concept and existential crisis kept the philosophy and the minutiae of the plot where it belonged, in the subtext and therefore with the audience. Reloaded in contrast played like a computer game with inserts written by a philosophy undergraduate - painfully laboured, expositionary dialogue and the worst Q and A in modern memory bolted onto a plot that apparently was going to convince us this was more than just a moderately clever sci-fi actioner, yesss indeed, this was a semi-religious experience! Techno-theology would you believe. You wouldn't? Thought it sounded like the self-important pontifications of films geeks who read the screenplay to Star Wars instead of the bible and registered themselves as 'Jedi' in the last census? Well you can go to hell, this is no trilogy for non-believers.The third film tempers down the bogus profundities and those tired myth making questions but the faith motif still dominates, yes, its an allegoricaust! Just as the characters (we'll call them that for now) must believe in Neo's divine credentials, we are asked to take a far greater leap of faith - namely that this all means something. That beyond the pre-school truisms (everything that has a beginning has an end, etc...) there is a dense, intellectually challenging story onto which a terrible script has been grafted, presumably by accident (perhaps the machines did it). The less they say the greater the ambiguity and the harder we work but hang on, what if this was the movie version of a kinder surprise egg without the toy inside and the filmmakers were in fact trying to preempt audience response by alluding to a grander design safe in the knowledge it will get buttons pushed the world over? The gag is this is it, there is no more. There, don't you feel stupid?This may be one of the first blockbusters specifically designed for the internet and fan boy community. With so much left deliberately underdeveloped and unexplained it'll be mecca for the terminally bored who'll no doubt write thousands of words on it when it deserves little or no attention. Fortunately I'm not falling into that trap. Watching Revolutions you feel it could have been written by a computer, ergo we bear witness to the systemic anomaly that ultimately leads to permanent and fatal errors. Its not all bad. The battle for Zion is impressive - visceral and exciting but the fact that this is the film's best sequence, an action set-piece rather than a moment of character development, testifies to the fact this baby has a weaker core than an apple dropped into a bowl of maggots. The 2nd and 3rd films crucially lack the economy and tight plotting of the first film that, combined with what felt like an original and innovative design, hid the shortcomings of the characters. This is all too evident in these joyless sequels where flabby plotting and ruinous doses of sentiment and exposition dominate (Was there any scene more painful that the demise of the one of 'major' characters?) At the end its all over but it isn't, I enjoyed it but I didn't - A load of old pixels? That I believe. Can we forget all about it now please?",5,0,0,10 November 2003
28 Weeks Later," Maybe its because I'm a Londoner...
","Those who live in it have always known it to be so, but now it's official, that is to say - enshrined on celluloid; London is a hard place to live. Still at least in the world of 28 weeks later you aren't forced to share a tiny space with millions of bad tempered, brain dead, herd minded lunatics, always in a hurry to get everywhere. You'd think a situation like that would be ripe for satire but...Then there's the tube. Everyone knows its a dank, cattle transport system where people would step over you rather than give you room to move. A repository of the living dead. Bags of social comment there. But again...With the war in Iraq now entering its 349th year with 3 trillion people dead and the landscape reduced to a bombed husk; murderous, blood thirsty insurgents bleeding out of every damaged building, public space and cranny, the presence of American solders attempting to police and reconstruct a decimated Britain would the perfect plot device to carpet bomb an audience with allegorical abstraction but no, not a bit of it.All of which is as true as the notion you can contain a monkey-based zombie emulating virus. 28 weeks later starts 28 weeks ago with Robert Caryle, later just slightly less insane than he was as Begbie in Trainspotting, leaving wife Catherine McCormack to be ravaged by some human rape bombs. He's later reunited with his kids and interned in the Isle of Dogs, perhaps the only scenario which might make you long to be back amongst the infected, vomiting blood. Her kids want a picture of Mum though, bless 'em, and improbably escape the blockade, returning to their house where McCormack is discovered alive, infected but curiously not that angry. She alone it seems has partial immunity to the virus and is brought back to the Dogs with predictably horrific results.Despite having much more money at his disposal, at least enough to put film in his camera, Juan Carlos Fernsadillo, taking over from Danny Boyle, still manages to retain the lo-fi grainy bleakness of the original film. He alternates between lavish aerial shots of a deserted London and frenetic, hand-held close up horror - upping the ante in terms of both gore and gun play - the introduction of the army providing much scope for the infected getting chunks blown out of them by trigger happy snipers. For all that, its a less human film than it's predecessor, perhaps because the one character with the most interesting moral conundrum - Caryle, is dispatched before he's had a chance to really face up to his actions (though getting a dose from the wife is pretty bad but does vindicate his decision to initially run for it). Following his descent into blood lust, Begbie - sorry, Don - improbably chases his children across most of London, bumping into them enough times to suggest that all the statistics about kids being most likely to be killed by their genetic forebears are spot on. If that wasn't enough, a line from Juan's own screenplay inadvertently undoes the entire first film, suggesting he may missed the first five minutes of it, when we learn that that the virus doesn't travel between species. I know we're close to apes and I'm no zoologist but they're still not quite humans are they? Still its good news for the Irish. Still Juan makes good use of his locations and the momentum is with the film, driving it forward to its lip curling conclusion in which another nation looks to pay the price for its decision to elect a right wing charlatan with designs on dismantling the country's well preserved social model.Yes, 28 jours plus tard should be a lot of fun.",7,6,14,12 May 2007
Armageddon," Blink and you'll miss it
","Effectively a remake of the 1978 disaster Meteor, but that film reconstituted through the brain of two overwrought p*ss-artists, namely Jerry Bruckheimer Â– he who would unleash bangs on us for eternity and his top dollar whore, Michael Bay; not so much a director in the classic sense, more a mechanistic film machine with eyes. In fact if Bay hadn't been seen in public it would be easy enough to believe that his name was a synonym for a directing computer developed by Industrial Light & Magic; programmed to replicate the moves of great helmers like Stanley Kubrick and, er, Paul Anderson but lacking the human capacity for feeling that made those men such warm, intimate filmmakers. But Bay is a man and one with the worst directorial style ever known to 110 years of cinema patrons. His technique, if you're interested, involves substituting movement for drama, music video gloss for decent cinematography, incident for story and ciphers for characters. His co-conspirators, his editor and his composer, give their contractual all to ensuring that every one of his synthetically stylish shots are given at least 2 seconds of screen time and each bang, cant and crane-assisted close-up are accompanied by plenty of plastic pathos.'I don't want to close my eyes, I don't want to fall asleep' sang Aerosmith's Steve Tyler in the hilariously titled tie-in single 'I don't want to miss a thing' but you did, you did and you did. With an average shot length of just 0.4 seconds, your ability to watch Armageddon is a lottery based on your pattern of blinking. This is deliberate so that having only registered about 45 minutes of screen time in a single sitting, an audience would be forced to watch it several times. This is genius of course but that aside, this confected cacophonic jingoistic man meat has all the real entertainment value of a Vegetarian Sunday lunchÂ…with no wine. NASA gets a lot of free advertising in this one but they'd have come off better if they'd released the Challenger Disaster looped, into cinemas.You can gain some fun from Armageddon though Â– play the drinking game. Take a shot of something really disgusting every time God is mentioned. You'll be dead about half an hour before the end, meaning you'll miss the climatic funeral scene AND the infamous 'he's got space dementia!' line. How's that for two good reasons?",2,5,9,11 November 2006
Van Helsing," Undead on arrival
","*Contains Spoilers*Steven Sommers is dangerous. You may not have been conscious of it until now but the man has abilities that would make many of his more fantastical characters seem redundant. Like a photochemical blue ring octopus, Sommers can paralyze the human body in less than two hours, causing higher brain functions to shut down completely. Gradually secondary functions, such as motor control, breathing and the ability to sit up straight encroach on impossible. Before long you're looking down the business end of misanthropic meltdown, a few frames away from becoming undead yourself. Will Hugh Jackman show up to put you out of your misery? Will he f***.You've seen Van Helsing before. I know you don't think so at the moment but cast your mind back to Sommer's last reworking of classic, better made horror fare, The Mummy and you've got the tone, characters and production methodology reproduced with a painful attention to detail. Evidently people attending the former sent all responsible the wrong message, namely that what the public wanted was more of the same, so you see you've only got yourselves to blame. I'll certainly be punishing myself this evening.
VH was supposed to be Sommer's slightly darker take on Universal's classic monster flicks but Sommers is no James Whale, though based on the evidence presented here he deserves to sample Whale's favourite pastime soon, preferably at the hand(s) of the seven footer playing Frankenstein's monster. Said creature isn't a bad metaphor for this flick, stitched together as it is from Whale's movies and Sommer's previous efforts. A copy of a copy then and with all the generational loss that implies, it's a depressing indictment of the directors Â‘big dumb fun' approach but it's too dumb to be any real fun and big in this case simply means the great man's trademark noise, wall to wall (sometimes surprisingly shoddy) computer generated effects and so close to one dimensional they can taste it, characters who constantly talk exposition rather than say anything, `We've got to get this to Van Helsing', `She's DEAD', `we've got 48 hours to save you/the world/our dignity' etcÂ… The characters and plot, and I use the term lightly, replicate the Mummy perfectly. Jackman stands in for Fraser, the guy you've never heard of is John Hannah providing the not in any way comic relief and Weisz is brought back from the cine-dead as Beckensale, impersonating her kick ass heroine Schick with care but being careful to have a east European accent so that the Mummy's leading lady can't show up at Universal and claim her pay packet. She even dies for God's sake. It's a poorly cut up corpse, messy in the mid-section with a blaring, ear bleeding soundtrack designed to stun the audience so that they won't notice the plot holes. It starts promisingly enough with a black and white prologue that recalls the original Frankenstein but after that this one heads for the grave with Jackman's Indiana Van Helsing, more a monster killing James Bond than anything conceived of by Bram Stoker, getting his orders from the Vatican(!), stocking up on weapons and sodding off to Transylvania to kill some really very good looking women and saving the world. That's it and you should know that by going to see this movie you're only encouraging Sommer's to make more so don't do it. He can be stopped but only if we all pull together. It's demographically target overproduced bilge from the vat marked Â‘franchise' but who are these people exactly? You, me? The teenaged gang sitting behind me in the cinema loved it, laughing in all the right places and evidently lapping up every minute. That they looked like habitual drug users was a matter of some concern. At $135M wouldn't it have been cheaper just to give these kids smack?  I lost two hours of my life today and although I'd only penciled in some light cooking and a screening of Â‘Gag Factor'(the biopic of comedian Tommy Cooper), I can't help but feel a little bitter. Cooper's gagging was impressive to say the least, incidentally. Complete cock.",5,0,1,6 May 2004
Rocky IV," Is it East against West or man against man?
","The formula was so well established by this point that Stallone could write one of these in his sleep and if Rocky's cold war clash is anything to go by, that's exactly what he did. For Sly it's just a case of joining the dots. Rocky doesn't want to fight but he's goaded to/provoked into/forced to for honourable purposes but isn't ready so must train harder than ever before while his seemingly unbeatable opponent benefits from superior facilities but is doomed to be defeated because he is complacent/arrogant/evil/not Rocky/all of the above. The details in-between don't really matter but if you're interested this time it's personal as Rocky's former Nemesis, turned friend, turned trainer Apollo Creed decides he's regarded as yesterday's man and vainly challenges Soviet killing machine Ivan Drago (Dolph Lungren) to an exhibition fight in which he's the only person surprised by his untimely death. The Italian Stallion could leave it there but a)Drago is ill-advisedly unrepentant and b)if he did the movie would be half an hour long so the revenge match is set for Christmas Day back in the good 'ol USSR and...well you know the rest. The forth Rocky is mindless entertainment and a blatant self-parody but although you could write the whole thing in less time than it takes for Apollo's bloody head to hit the canvas it's genuinely enjoyable stuff. From the moment Creed is, as the Scots say, deed, the rest of the film is pure 80's excess - a clip strewn montage, a cheesy power ballad, Rocky coming to terms with his demons by driving his Ferrari through the night etc, etc... When the Rockster gets to Russia (Wyoming apparently) he's got only revenge on his mind and so we get to the final 45 minutes which every Rocky fan waits for in which Stallone's back to basics, low tech approach - cutting logs with a axe, pulling cars, climbing mountains, is contrasted with the Soviet's high-tech, computerised training programme. All your instincts tell you that Rocky is doomed but as he reaches the summit of that slope, the synthesiser score reaching a crescendo you know that somehow Americas going to pull it out of the bag and although you were a hardened cynic just half an hour earlier, you're now watching the most unlikely match-up in boxing history chanting 'Rocky! Rocky!'. This may be the brilliance of Stallone's film because although its as sophisticated as some twigs and a bit of flint, it's almost impossible not to root for the inevitable victor - shameless manipulation aside, which is basically the entire film, you're a cold hearted, joy-less shell if you don't go 'yeeeahhh' when Drago is finally cut by Rocky's punch even though in reality Rocky would have to have arms 8 feet in length just to reach the Soviet's face. Not everyone would have the guts to distill the entire cold war into a single boxing match with Stallone the unlikely broker of peace but just such a miracle occurs here and when Rocky gives his slurred, barely inaudible riposte to the tensions between the superpowers 'If I cun chaaange, then youu cun chaangge, we caaan all changee!' and even Gorbachov gets to his feet you know you've transcended mere popcorn fare and entered the arena of comic genius. The Reds might be a bunch of humourless, oppressed warmongers but they're no match for the Gipper's pugilist special envoy. Is it any wonder the evil empire collapsed after this?",7,0,0,27 May 2005
Quantum of Solace," Artistic licence to kill
","Daniel Craig returns to the role he saved from irrelevance and if we find him in a gloomy place, spare a thought for the blue eyed assassin - that's a dark corner he now shares with the filmmakers as well as the villains.We have reason to fear Quantum. Their reach extends to the film's editors who are shadow men doing evil work to what you imagine was a fairly exciting thriller. They're complicit in an attempt to make each action sequence as elusive as possible. As an audience you're aware something is happening but it's like being caught in the middle of a bar fight having been glassed in the head from behind. This is maddening, frustrating editing Â– a Bond movie chewed up and passed through the Bourne Trilogy's celluloid digestive tract. Not even the theme song escapes this butchering. Constructing action this way is tossing money on the fire, necking whisky and urinating on the flames. Each sequence is as furious and cold as Craig's Bond but while this is highly effective as a tool for characterisation, its effect on each set piece is to brutally undermine the line of action, truncating what may have been show stopping moments and robbing them of those beats that fuel anticipation, nervous tension and most crucially, excitement.The moments in between, where a Bond film breathes and is punctuated with humour, chic and yes, sex, are either mercilessly brief or absent and this makes Quantum of Solace feel slight and uninvolving. Obfuscation is the name of the game this time round but the filmmakers have extended this principle to the story and have confounded us all in the process.Perhaps this pared down inelegance is what Bond's producers imagine a modern action audience wants, after all the aforementioned Bourne movies have been praised for their crack head cutting and real world brutality. The aesthetic is disorientating, messy but has a visceral punch that shakes up an audience in a way conventional editing struggles to replicate. That's fine of course but Bond's audience expects elegance, refinement and a sense of style, not stylisation that causes a film to eat itself. Solace struggles because it's so involved in machine gunning imagery into its audience that it forgets to entertain them. Consequently you have a strange post-view sensation that there was much that was good in it Â– Craig, the sumptuous visuals, the expressively mounted action, the Bolivian cab driver Â– it's just that you struggled to see much of it; it all fell between the gaps in the shots.A prick tease picture through and through and the first movie to fully replicate the deep seated frustration that results from sexual abstention coupled with a gyrating beauty on your lap but one you can't touch because there's a gun in your mouth; Solace is still preferable to the series parodying itself but Royale showed you can pull this trick better and with greater heft.A razor across your eyeballs, corneas ripped to shreds, Solace's climax has Bond and Camille, who watched her family burn, huddled as an inferno closes in around them. Teary and terrified she speaks for herself and the audience as shot after shot dies having only enjoyed barely a second of existence Â– mayfly editing; 'not like this, not like this' she tells a battered Bond. Well quite.",6,36,69,31 October 2008
Alien vs. Predator," We Lost!
","It would've been a better movie with the Goonies. Imagine the setup: A pyramid full of traps and moving passageways and some grotesques in hot pursuit - que Chunk, Data, Mikey, Mouth and the older ones whose names I can't remember too well and before you can say 'the jungle came alive and took him' you've got yourself an excellent two hours. Its the kind of risk that could have paid dividends - The Predator reneges on killing Chunk because of his amusing anecdote about vomiting into Mikey's lunchbox after stuffing his face with donuts, a Data/Alien Queen face off in which the bitch is brought down by a poison dart attached to a spring and how about Mouth actually talking down a facehugger? The more I think about it the more disappointed I feel about the version that made it to the screen - overblown, underplotted, poorly conceived characters, not one good joke and, worst of all, no chance to enter your high score over the end credits. Come to think of it, where was all the violence? That put Predator 2 up a notch. Seems to me that making a Alien/Predator movie for ze kids is a bit of a busted flush, I mean what's the point? Granted, there's plenty of psychological violence aimed at the audience, some of it intentional, but thats not really good enough. On the up side I'm willing to bet my neighbour's skull that it hasn't inflicted a fatal blow to either series. Alien 4 was worse after all, and the aforementioned Predator 2 didn't exactly stroke the pleasure receptors so to be fair we've been a bit fortunate but lets not do it again anytime soon...unless it's Paul W.S Anderson VS Paul T. Anderson but I'm guessing that PWSAVPTA isn't a friendly acronym for your average studio marketing department. A crying shame.",Null,0,1,25 October 2004
Batman Begins," 'Wait! Now this is good work.'
","So 8 years after Batman's Schumacher-defiled corpse was buried shallow in fluorescent topsoil is it a case of Chris and Chris - the new dynamic duo or a fresh opportunity missed? Well a bit of both actually. Batman Begins is an altogether different take on the DC comics character from Burton's fantasy excess or that other mans two-portions of memory pollution. Its a concerted and often successful attempt to take the thing seriously, as much a reaction to the toddler orientated tat of the last two films as a new beginning. Nolan and Bale are determined that this should be an adult adventure and its played straight with a meaty psychological foundation with action set-pieces kept to a minimum. This is the nice surprise of Batman Begins because in contrast to its big screen predecessors the titular character is pushed to the forefront and for once his psyche is properly dissected so that those big themes of fear, guilt and revenge take centre stage and we get to know Bruce Wayne a little bit even if he is a miserable bastard. Previous Bat-directors didn't really know what to do with Batman so they kept the focus on his larger than life enemies but Nolans clever enough to realise that Batman is every bit as disturbed as those he'd pursue and that the character's origin story knocks your Joker's and Penguin's into a cocked hat. Nolan's caped crusader is for once a real predator, not just a man in a silly costume and Bale finally gives you a characterisation you can chew on as opposed to a famous face going through the motions. Whether its the definitive take on the Dark Knight as he claims is open to debate but its certainly the best we've seen yet.Nolan deliberately steers clear of Burton's Gothic stylisation or Schumacher's...well Schumacher and creates a Gotham with the sense of the real about it in keeping with the film's more grounded tone. Its a adaptation without a trace of camp just real world explanations for now familiar elements and this makes the whole thing fairly engaging and occasionally surprising. That said, the introspective, measured approach doesn't make for much of a show in the classically entertaining sense and you do sometimes miss Burton's gift for the theatrical and the absurd which he could also make dark and twisted. Having had Batman movies where the villains have it all their way we're suddenly looking at the converse situation - Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow genuinely disturbing but underused. I wasn't too keen on the eastern set opening half hour either, which is a bit of a mess and poorly cut with flashbacks to Wayne's childhood or the anonymous mood music which is supposed to pass for a score. I suppose once you've been reared on Elfman there's no going back but Nolan obviously thought a full blown orchestral accompaniment might have upset the balance of the movie. I think he's wrong about that but it didn't detract too much from my enjoyment - if anything the subtle approach heightened the emotive power of some scenes, which of course was the point. So all in all Batman Begins isn't really much fun but it does have half a brain in its head and has a real go at fleshing out the caped crusader for an audience who are old enough to appreciate the effort. The movie ends with a nicely judged speech by Gary Oldman's Lt. Gordon which sets up a potential sequel with the Joker and I can say that based on what I've seen here that's one contest I'll look forward to. He's dour, he's disturbed and he's a little po-faced but no matter, Batman, against all odds, is back.",7,1,2,24 June 2005
1941," Nineteen to Eight
","Hysterical...Not hysterical as in 'outrageously funny' you understand but hysterical as in hyperactive for 1941 is really just two and a bit hours of overly theatrical slapstick, noise, shouting - a lot of shouting and a hoard of actors who look as if they've wandered into a wartime version of Noises Off but without the choreography. Its not awful per say it just doesn't work as a comedy. The script by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is peppered with good ideas but the resulting film is a mess - incoherent in places, meandering and unsure of its focus. Spielberg well and truly loses his grip on the thing very early on and some imaginative sequences aside, generally doesn't know who its about or where they all fit into the directionless escapade. You can watch it in a neutral kind of way but most of it falls flat and after 90 minutes or so you just want to shut half the cast up. Luckily for Spielberg and the two Bobs they were more than talented enough to bounce back but this movie ALMOST scuppered Back to the Future and for that alone you may want to look at it like the celluloid equivalent of a the friend who tired to run off with your girlfriend and destroy your relationship. Do you really want to see him again after that?",5,0,1,25 July 2005
28 Days Later...," Animals have no rights
","A extreme sense of unease runs throughout 28 days later, particularly in the terrific first act which sees hero Jim (the luckiest man ever to have been involved in a road accident)awake to find London totally deserted. Londoners especially will sense a distinct chill at this disturbing sequence, shot on eery DV which gives the entire movie (bar the epilogue)a rough disarming look, instead the comfortable crisp image of celluloid that we're all used to. I've never been convinced for the need to use DV up to this point, as 35mm film looks so good, but the overall effect works so well here that i've changed my mind. Rarely for this kind of movie, its not all running and gore; there's some particularly touching scenes, including the billboard in Picadilly Circus saying goodbye to lost or missing relatives (shades of ground zero) and Jim's discovery of his dead parents which leaves a distinct lump in the throat. Its in the middle section that the film lags, particularly on the journey to Manchester in which some character moments slow the pace down considerably, and the final third too closely resembles the Beach for my liking (you'll see what I mean) but at least Jim doesn't turn into a bad playstation game so its not all bad. Lets face it, any movie that has Manchester in flames has got to be worth a couple of hours of your time hasn't it?",7,0,0,3 November 2002
School of Rock," I didn't understand this film
","Comedy in which lazy, benefit dependent waster is finally brought to book on backrent and illegally assumes his best-friend's position as a substitute teacher as he has no employment prospects of his own and ends up teaching rock music appreciation to privileged ten year olds as a perverse form of wish-fulfillment in order that he can use them to enter a music competition which he hopes will pave his way to fame and fortune although experience and common-sense suggests the dimateric opposite will occur.What's wrong with this picture? Perhaps the idea that you can teach the spirit of civic and moral rebellion to a group of middle-class private school children who are culturally and intellectually incapable of placing the iconoclastic ethos and social commentary invested in the music into context. The most offensive of these kids, Zack,understandably feels angry with a life of comfort, top dollar education and the certainty of social and economic advantage in the future and so turns to punk - a movement born out of social deprivation, counter-cultural disillusion and the British working class as a focus for his musical muse. Black meanwhile, strutting around the classroom like a one man comic book convention - extols a curriculum of half-bakery, cod-philosophy and rock truisms without ever encouraging the children to find their own musical and spiritual direction. In a typical exchange he tells the kids that rock is about 'giving it to the man' and 'venting your frustrations' but in reality he is pursuing an agenda of wealth and worldwide fame. We realize what he's REALLY saying during a conversation with a awkward, keyboard playing child of oriental origin in which Black notes that 'if you're in a great rock band everyone will want to party with you'. In other words, clearly lacking any other social advantage (looks, a focused work ethic, intelligence) Black only real interest is in making himself popular - the very anthithesis of what Rock is about. Further to this we're forced to endure the spectre of black sexualising younger girls as groupies and tip-toeing dangerously close to the line as he attempts to compensate for his lack of success with women and the inevitable sexual frustration that follows. The whole sorry affair climaxing in an sub-mini pops concert in which Black's training produces songs on the subject on school work and exam results, and they let this man teach music afterwards? I'd lock the b*stard up.Honestly, what is this film for?",Null,2,5,27 July 2004
Back to the Future Part III," A taste of the original.
","...but just a taste mind you, then its back in the wrapper and on with the now unbelievably complex story in this final bit of time jumping good time, 'rum pum pum, bang the magic drum' entertainment. Better plotted than part II because it has a simpler, more character focused story, it's really Doc Brown's film in which Marty plays an lesser role and thats fine with me because he was always my favourite of the two anyway. I'm not a fans of Westerns, though they've grown on me in the last few years, but the third portion is a affectionate pastiche which plenty to enjoy and although a love interest sub-plot is about as welcome as freight train careering into your life's work, Mary Steenburgen, drippy and a little bit kooky, just about cuts the mustard though given her tendency to cause problems for the time travelling duo perhaps letting her fall to her death might have been the safest course of action. Its all tied up in a fairly moralistic, 'everyone gazes lovingly into each others eyes' fashion which makes us cynical Europeans groan a bit and I'm fairly sure steam power isn't quite a viable substitute for plutonium but in a series with flying cars and a Libyan terrorist cell chasing a teenager with a rocket launcher in the middle of a Californian shopping mall car park, thats just niggling. A terrible waste of a Delorean too, you can't just walk into a showroom and buy another one y'know!",8,2,2,19 January 2006
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Fincher goes backwards
","A quirk of film spectatorship is how, ever so often, and despite being several stages removed from the alchemic processes of collaboration that power creativity, you just sense that a film isn't going to work. In the case of Benjamin Button, the news that Eric Roth, who penned the interminably folksy Forrest Gump, had written a screenplay which David Fincher would direct, raised an eyebrow in the Frames household. The portents were as black as Carol Thatcher's nightmares. Like Gump, Button would chart the lifetime of a boorish miscreant, or cipher, whose job it was to guide us through several decades of American History. Robert Zemeckis, a technocentric director whose movies had been enhanced by bravura visual effects, directed Gump and although being his blandest film, attained a clutch of Oscars for his trouble. Oscars that his funnier, edgier and more entertaining pictures had never stood a chance of winning.David Fincher, like Zemeckis, is a director whose grip on the use of effects as a story enhancing tool rather than a sideshow, is so tight that his direction is almost an effect itself. He gave us Fight Club, one of the most astute and thematic rich satires ever made. Seven was a classic thriller. Zodiac a genre shredding police procedural where the devil really was in the detail. Three superb pictures and no industry recognition whatsoever. What to do? Well perhaps, reasoned Fincher, doing 'a Zemeckis', was the way forward. After all, good as he is, the man's got an ego right? This alone must explain why a filmmaker previously attracted to such engaging, edgy material, was motivated to direct Roth's fatuous slab of homespun whimsy - a light touch jaunt through the 20th century as seen through the eyes of a glaze eyed non-entity.If Forrest Gump succeeded at all, and the debate goes on, it was as a result of it's canny juxtaposing of the dull everyman with extraordinary moments in US History and the characters that populated it. Look, there's Gump shaking hands with President Kennedy! There he is with John Lennon! But Benjamin Button, bless his one dimensional heart, barely makes a mark on history as he inoffensively passes through it. The fact he's aging backwards making him one of the most extraordinary humans to have ever lived, if anything, goes virtually unnoticed, as if it was no more remarkable than an unusual skin disease. The potential of the premise is therefore offensively wasted, to the point where you're not convinced his aging normally would have made much of an impact on his life. Button's plight (he is born computer generated) might have given him a unique perspective on the human condition and what a different movie it could have been had Pitt played someone with the mind of Oscar Wilde - a cutting intelligence and wit brought to bear on his inverted existence and the lives he touched upon the way. But the Gump model only works it's magic if you find profundity in the banal and the chocolate box truisms that have the least demanding members of the audience nodding their heads and wiping a tear from their sentimentally swollen eyes. Thus it's a superficial, curiously still piece of work that hopes you'll graft your own experiences on to Pitt's blank canvas and in doing so, squeeze out the melancholy as you remember your own lost loves, your own disappointments, your own missed opportunities. That's fine if you're in the mood but otherwise you might think Fincher is wasting your time and unlike Pitt, you're not getting any younger.The only thing that saves Button from complete irrelevance is the technical showmanship on display. As with Fincher's previous efforts, the meticulousness in the framing of each shot married with the highly inventive use of CGI speaks to the intelligence behind the camera. It's also a handsome film, as they say in New Orleans, impressively mounted and richly photographed. But Fincher, who to his credit pulls back from fully fledged Gump levels of sentiment, can do nothing with Roth's mawkish script and consequently Button is easy on the eye but unforgiving on the mind. Has Fincher sold out with it? Well he may finally get his Oscar but as he stands at the podium, golden statuette in hand and grin fixed for the cameras he'd do well to remember Tyler Durden's warning from the long long ago - 'The things you own end up owning you'.",4,1,3,8 February 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Black and White and Red all over
","A brief but engrossing bit of Political-Clooney and his most biting work since Batman and Robin (It was a satire of Hollywood BlockbustersÂ…wasn't it?). Needless to say, so here I am doing just that, that it's a period piece about the here and now with Whistler from Sneakers recovering his sight to star as Edward R.Murrow, CBS News Anchor and champion of liberal, anti-neocon sentimentÂ…vis a vis 'freedom of speech' as its known nowadays. Sentator McCarthy doubles as the Bush Administration to give us a timely reminder of what fear can do to would-be democracies and the movie is spot-on in laying out its stall with efficient, direct exactitude. This is Steak Pie and Potatoes film-making Â– lean, no-frills, no bulls*it stuff Â– satisfying and substantial. It makes it point very convincingly, not least because it doesn't editorialise too much itself so to speak Â– a neat little mirror to to the choice of Murrow and co. The use of archive material is well considered and plentiful meaning that often whole sequences are shown in full as if to say 'no dramatisation required', while the CBS scenes are restrained and well-judged Â–ultimately the facts, Clooney suggests, speak for themselves and indeed they do Â– lucidly. The, dare we say, artistic decision to shoot in Black and White is a solid one as it marries the drama with the archive in a fairly seamless fashion and heightens the sense of period. The final lines about Television's role as a means for education rather than crude entertainment is as relevant as ever and although Tocqueville contended that we have absolutely nothing to learn from History whatsoever, I think Clooney safely kicks that one to ground...but would the Frenchman have done Schumacer's movie? Very good then and the best movie about communism since Hesterkefilis' 'Chairmam Mao Mao and the Teen Kitten Chorus' (1985) Â– a must see by the way.",8,1,2,9 March 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Wonka's Shame
","A horrid little film which glorifies one man's interest in side-stepping unionised labour, the human rights act, Industrial practise and creating mass unemployment in a small town while coining it in at the expense of a cheap child-sized workforce imported for overseas. Its an utterly shameful exercise dressed up as children's entertainment and its time it was stopped. So Wonka's the commercial genius with 'the most fabulous chocolate factory in the world' well fine but not so good for poor Grandpa Joe Bucket who's poor family has to eat cabbage soup in a dilapidated town house with no roof because the old man lost his job without any form of redundancy package because of Industrial espionage in which he had no part to play. Yet the old man reveres Wonka as a wonderful eccentric and confectionery king, how the elderly forget! You don't hear old fleet street mob singing Murdoch's praises after they were replaced by computer software at the Australian American's Wapping plant do you? No, so we bear witness to the classic deference of the British working class - experts at keeping themselves ghettoised throughout the ages, revering the very people that keep them poor and socially-economically impotent. The same impulse that causes people from council estates to shake the hands of royalty generates statements like 'Wonka's a genius Charlie!' He may be a genius but he's also the main cause of their suffering and deprivation. So we've seen that Wonka isn't exactly a humanitarian, in fact he makes his money based on the exploitation of childhood greed. He invites five kids to his factory to find an heir, fair enough you may think, but four are just there to be tortured, humiliated and in some cases, mutilated. The Candyman hates kids but he's happy for them to do back breaking work for beans. I know you'll say Oompa Loompas are adults but lets be honest, their no better than Malasian four year olds making trainers. Wonka the liberator? Don't make me laugh - hes displaced an entire nation and used them to make a fortune, money that must look good on the books as the wage bill is nil - nuts for squirrels and cocoa for kids - all written off as substandard ingredients. If you want to talk about the film itself then all I'd say is that its a confused little piece - can't decide if its set in America or England - all the characters speak like Brits but use Americanisms. British kids don't use the word Candy, its sweets or Chocolate OK? Burton true to recent form is complete anonymous - this thing could have been directed by anyone. Wonka's back-story is pointless - inserted to provide a horrid, syrup drenched ending which kills the sequel and turns the whole escapade into a dreary 'importance of family' chronicle. Utterly wrong. Oh and you can't hear the lyrics to any of the songs. Not only that but the critics who've said that this is a darker film than the 1971 version are blind, in fact the '71 was deceptively wholesome but had a healthy streak of cruelty running through it, this by comparison pretends to be dark while actually being safe and child friendly. Gene Wilder has been soiled. Wake him up and tell him someone!",5,1,3,20 August 2005
The Dark Knight," The last laugh
","An engaging and psychologically rewarding character study that paints the word 'dichotomy' across the screen in blood red lipstick and forces you to reflect on it over two and half bleak but for the most part well judged hours. Why so serious? Because Joel Schumacher is always watching that's why.If characterisation is the yardstick, The Dark Knight is the most dense and finely drawn Batman movie yet made - interweaving the motivations and moral complications of its cast with a magician's slight of hand and a calculating intelligence. The ambiguities thrown up by the plot aren't subtle by any means but that it feels less signposted than we've come to expect in comic book fare is attributable to Nolan's deft handling of the material and his refusal to over egg the pudding with laden dialogue or simplistic conceptions of good and evil.As entertainment it fares less well. One of the sublime pleasures of Tim Burton's 1989 Batman movie was your total immersion in a hyperreal Gothic dystopia, augmented with a score that perfectly partnered the aesthetic.Nolan's Batpics have one dirty foot in the real world making them less cartoons than Film Noirs with costumes but there are times during this 150 minutes when the lack of stylized backdrop or sweeping score make it a relatively still and cold experience.Nolan takes his directorial cues from the likes of Johnathan Demme and Michael Mann but doesn't frame action or build suspense with their assured touch. That isn't to say that TDK isn't involving but there's a workmanlike quality to some of the spectacle here and nothing to wrongfoot the audience with the same verve as say Silence of the Lambs did 20 years ago.An occasionally elliptical narrative and confused framing in fight scenes sometimes suggests that Nolan's realisation of his script was more sure footed than his choices in the editing suite but where he scores major hits is in his handling of tone and the drawing out of the comic book's more challenging themes. This is a Batman movie that has been futureproofed in being aimed at Adults and consequently it should have a long and respected self-life when the likes of Spider-man are filling space on charity shop shelves marked up for 75 pence.One disappointment with this Batflick, particularly given the prominence he was afforded in 'Begins' is that Christian Bale gets somewhat lost amongst a large cast with character trajectories more integral to the plot. The deceased Heath Ledger is very good, giving a creepy, dread soaked performance. He's the bastard child of Seth Brundle in mid-transformation and Hannibal Lecter with all the discomfort that implies while Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent/Two Face is less involving but well handled and performs a public service in permanently wiping all memory of Tommy Lee Jones horrific turn in Batman Forever. God Bless you Aaron.Ultimately its easier to admire than to love but TDK is superior, involving fare which talks up to it's audience without ever really getting their pulse racing. The storytelling values displayed bode well for the series but if this can married with a little more care in constructing setpieces and please please please a proper score rather than this ambient mood music (two composers and not a single, memorable note), the next film might be a real treasure. As it stands this is just very good but with the likes of Michael Bay forever circling I'll take that with thanks.",8,1,4,27 July 2008
Green Street Hooligans," Your not singing anymore...on account of those head injuries
","No, not a biopic of Sidney Greenstreet but a film about football hooligans though having watched it you might find yourself a little bitter about the fact that the portly British actor doesn't feature.Any discussion of Green Street has to centre on Elija Wood, the stunt cast lead, because his inclusion tells you two very important things about how the Film Industry works. First funding: Watching this thing hit you for 90 minutes like a Millwall Fan's bloody fist, you can imagine a conversation between the production company and the backers in which the not especially decent script was bolstered by the surprise attachment of Frodo Baggins. 'We've got the star of Lord of the Rings interested!' they cried. From that moment the cash was in the bag but didn't someone stop to wonder whether or not the gentle, quasi-pubescent actor was the right choice for a film about English football violence? Someone almost certainly did but without Wood the script was buried so they kept those reservations to themselves. Secondly Star Vanity - Wood is probably the only person, bar the director who's a German Kick-boxing Champion (no, seriously) and thus only a fraction less aware of British football culture than old Elija, who can imagine himself as a Havard Student turned West Ham Supporting hardnut. 'I need to shed my little boy lost image' he'll have told himself and so Green Street must have seemed like the perfect project to do it. The trouble is Wood is ludicrous as the American student, a near-graduate of the most prestigious University in the world, who decides that beating up Manchester United supporters with West Ham fans is the education he so badly needs. Several things strike you about this problem, one that undermines the entire story and pushes the whole thing toward low-comedy. Firstly Wood is a journalism student, albeit one with the poorest critical faculty in the world. Does he question the violent subculture into which he is thrust? Not at all - instead he's hooked after one chat in the pub with Pete, his mockney guide and thereafter loses any common sense he might have had, practically falling over himself to get stuck in to the latest beating. Even a hack working for the Sun, not journalists known for their brains, in fact some have barely got a G.C.S.E in English, would be brandishing this lot scum and calling for them to strung up. Wood however can't get enough of it which suggests that a career in the purview of analytical thought and the careful dissemination of facts may not be one to which he is well suited.Believe it or not this is not the worst of Green Street's problems. Having paid scant attention to Wood's motives for joining the 'GSE' (its the lack of a Father figure... or something), it then goes on to unquestionably embrace the practise of making blood pies from people's faces as a perfectly legitimate form of camaraderie between men - blood brothers using the weekly scrap as the ultimate expression of their intractable bond. Now you and I might say, hang on a minute, they're beating people to death because these meat headed stroke merchants have a chemical imbalance in the brain, low intelligence and world view slightly less sophisticated than the Daily Mail editorial but for every scene that starts to criticise and then pulls back from doing so as if the director was afraid the film would turn on him and start beating his head against a table, there are many more in which the 'Blood Brothers' angle is promoted and repeated, the worst being the ridiculous climax in which a giant fight is set to a horrendous song, the lyrics of which talk about bonds and family; this all being edited to shots of men getting the living excrement beaten out of them. Claire Forlani improbably shows up in this scene, driving to the sight of a mini-riot with her baby to find Wood - a moment that perfectly captures the improbable nature of the entire enterprise. So that's Green Street kids - bloody nonsense but it would be rude to go without mentioning Pete, the leader of the West End 'firm'. Here's another bit of funny casting which has you scratching the head. The actor in question can't do a Cockney accent any more then I can and after you've heard him roll through the clichÃ©s 'Yaw 'aving a bubble mate', 'I'm feelin' a bit Terrence Trent D'arby' etc..., you have to ask yourself, were there no REAL cockney actors available? It was filmed in London for God's sake! Why hire a stage school boy from the Shires? In a movie where people can believe Wood was the inspiration for the Karate Kid despite the fact he'd have been about 3 months old when it came out, its par for the course. Everyone involved should be sent off...permanently.",3,9,16,17 September 2005
National Treasure," If there's treasure here it's very well hidden.
","Yet more from the rather dung encrusted stable of Jerry Bruckheimer; a slight vehicle for Nicolas Cage who plays a modern day Indiana Jones, albeit one who's smoked a lot more dope and isn't overtly physical. He's the latest in along line of treasure hunters who are convinced that somewhere in America there's a hoard of priceless artifacts which have alluded the common man for the better part of 200 years. The opener establishes that this trove is signposted in invisible ink on the back of that treasonous document, the so-called Declaration of Independence. The rest of the movie is one long chase as all concerned rush to steal said map and acquire the spoils. National Treasure isn't much of anything; light on action, thin on plot and about as subtle as pair of testicles in a vegetarian salad. It's supposed to be light and entertaining family fare and in this respect its partially successful, after all it moves along at a fair old pace and never gets too violent or taxing for younger viewers. That's not really enough to sustain the rest of us over the course of two hours though and its hard to escape the conclusion that its a decidedly poor effort given the potential of the premise. No-one's expecting Citizen Kane here but would a bit more attention to character and some descent set-pieces have killed anyone? Incidentally, a word to the Hollywood elite: NEVER cast Sean Bean as a villain again under any circumstances - I mean it, the next time I go on a bloody killing spree.",5,2,4,14 May 2005
Rocky," Only In America
","By law in the UK its compulsory for the Rocky Movies to be shown once every 6 months and so we're all something approaching experts on the Italian Stallion and his best bouts. I therefore humbly offer you the benefit of my country's Balboa expertise. Rocky's one of those movies that's pleasure tends to defy logical scrutiny. On paper its a fairly familiar archetypal inspirational drama about a poor boxer who gets the chance to fight the heavyweight champion of the world in a one-off for America's bicentenary dreamt up as a gimmick by the champ himself, Apollo Creed, to celebrate the countries mantle as the land of opportunity. Fairytale stuff then, except instead of getting to wear pink slippers and marry a prince, Balboa gets to have his brains smashed out in front of a baying for blood crowd. Obviously Rocky, who already looks as though he has brain damage from too many head blows, isn't thought to stand a chance. Creed's the champ after all, he's got all the money, all the experience - it'd be like me picking a fight with Mohammed Ali (in his heyday not now naturally, I'm not a complete bastard) and as Creed puts his feet up and awaits the walkover, the sound of etching can be heard as the Stallion's marble memorial is prepared. Can you see where this going? Of course you can and that's the point. Rocky is old fashioned Hollywood - adversity and long odds conquered by raw guts, determination and heart. It's what America is supposed to be all about and released in 1976 it was barely a shock that the gutter to the stars tale was rewarded with a best picture Oscar. Stallone's titular meathead makes for a likable hero. He may be dumber than a box of rubber swords but the semi-audible lug is a suitably endearing contrast with the arrogant Creed who wins on points (stetching credibility would be left to the sequels) but loses the battle for hearts and minds. If it's supremely entertaining it's because we're all a sucker for this kind of inspirational bilge. Rocky woos the demure object of his affections, runs up steps, trains hard and all to the emotive strings of Bill Conti, who goes a long way to wringing the last shred of cynicism out of the audience. It's never going to feature in your top hundred but Rocky packs a punch and we all know he really won the fight anyway.",7,0,2,6 June 2005
The Descent," Oh Good God No.
","A film about menstruation based on the Freudian model in which girls a plenty confront bloody vampriric monsters in a cavernous hell. You can say its about bereavement, you can say its about repressed Lesbian relationships, though you'd be wrong there; you could even say its about nothing but I say you're wrong - its one long bit of anxiety about the female cycle and I DON'T mean the one your girlfriend bought from Halfords this morning. In terms of imagery its everywhere - wild and deadly fluctuations in mood against a backdrop of blood drenched passages. Everyone knows the definitive take on the subject is The Blob but this is a close second. Saturated in horrid, ovulating imagery its a pion to the desires of the flesh - those feelings that build to a bloody crescendo at a certain time. The final third is resplendent with multitudinous acts of penetration - a symbolic acknowledgement of the contradictory desire to be impregnated at a time when its the most dangerous. I found it to be a gruelling, unpleasant experience as a result because lets be honest, no-one wants to get into that sort of thing do they?",7,3,7,25 July 2005
Inside Man," 'Why don't you take a picture, I'll bend down and pick up a pencil if you like'
","Clever Clive Owen's got a plan to rob a bank and he duly does but strangely having broken in with his team, steals nothing and takes the customers hostage and waits it out while Detective Denzel Washington tries to fathom the whole thing with the police outside. Meanwhile Jodie Foster gets a call from bank owner Christopher Plummer and is ordered to safeguard the contents of a safe deposit box lieing inside the bank's vaultÂ… This is relatively conventional fare from Spike Lee Â– heavily literate in 70's heist thrillers, indeed Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon get name checked during it's tense, carefully layered running time. This is Lee's easiest Joint to ingest in quite some time but easy shouldn't be confused with simple because Inside Man is intelligent, thoughtfully plotted stuff bolstered by the fine interplay between Owen and Washington. It works because it resembles numerous other similarly themed offerings, the aforementioned Pacino flicks included but subverts such expectations by copying the setup and then refusing to go to any of the usual places. This means you've often jumped ahead thinking you know what's going to transpire only to find Clive Owen's gun in your faceÂ…metaphorically speaking of course. Lee's strength has always been his instinctive understanding of community conflict and social difference Â– here used to great effect, particularly in fleshing out the multi-ethnic characters that populate the bank and notably in the tense relationship between Washington's tec and Foster's high at heel troubleshooter who's as rotten as a week old corpse but a nice contrast with Denzel's honest but rough round the edges rozzer. A fine script by Russell Gewirtz is done justice by a director with two firm hands on the material and a nice steady grip on the tension. A highly satisfying and often stylish night in the cinema for those of you looking for a meaty retooled slice of hard boiled New York Americana.",8,2,3,27 March 2006
Titanic," The movie that made my face list to the right
","Surely millions of people worldwide, a billion dollars and 11 Oscars can't be wrong can they? Well yes, actually.The problem with Titanic is that Cameron treats the whole enterprise like one of his action pictures, replete with the kind of staging you'd expect from that genre, but not alas, from a dramatisation of a genuine tragedy. Cameron has no faith in the emotional weight of the historical facts, and if we were being cynical we could also say no interest. This is an exercise in ego and directorial hubris from the outset, namely the idea that the writers fictional teenage romance - a story that never succeeds in rising above its clichÃ©d origins, is required to connect a contemporary audience to the events of 1912. You can see the logic because clearly the world's worst peacetime maritime tragedy, 1,500 dead and the planets most luxurious ocean liner sinking on its maiden voyage isn't an interesting enough story in itself. Subsequently the titular ship becomes merely a backdrop for a populist voyage into tedium. Just as you'd feel uneasy at the prospect of Michael Bay doing Jane Austen, Cameron doing period romance seems a little far fetched. Jack and Rose allow us to spend some time on the ship prior to its sinking and an impressive recreation it is but you'd quite like them to go away so we could see what the real passengers were up to. That he sustains momentum throughout this picture is despite his script, rather than because of it. His talent for pacing and moving a story forward serves him well in this respect but with fictional characters as one note as these, and with the ships real passengers reduced to supporting parts to bolster Cameron's mills and boon narrative, we, unlike the real passengers are quite grateful to see the Iceberg emerging from the watery depths.Once the ship hits the film moves up a gear and suddenly there is enough to sustain interest until the stilted syrup drenched epilogue. However, Cameron still stages the sinking like one giant set piece which saps the film of any emotional impact. A real tribute to the ship, rather than a cynical exercise in emotional manipulation would have taken an objective position and allowed the real events to unfold, giving us a chance to take in the full force of real events. This film concerns itself with fiction and doing so attempts to tell you what to feel and when to feel it. For me, this has the opposite effect and the scenes toward the end featuring Winslet and Decaprio are virtually unwatchable.The production design is superb and its all very epic and grandiose but ultimately Titanic is a disappointment because it takes a real tragedy and turns it into populist entertainment. History for people not interested in History. If you think thats a harsh assessment then imagine a similar scenario applied to a retelling of the September 11th attacks and think how inappropriate that would seem. These people may be 90 odd years dead but they deserve more respectful treatment than this. Watch 'A night to remember' (1958) for a far better depiction of events which was informed by accounts of the sinking not by one man who thought he had something to 'add' to this terrible event.

Rocky III," Hit me baby one more time
","And so to the third Rocky in which a complacent Stallone has grown fat on opulence and celebrity and finds himself unprepared for the hungry and you'd have to say insane challenger, Clubber Lang, none other than Mr.T in the first role of a surprisingly undistinguished movie career. Rocky's beaten naturally because his cheque book isn't quite strong enough to cushion Lang's punches and even worse, Lang has roughed up trainer Mickey and caused him to have a fatal heart attack. Such setbacks would dampen the spirits of lesser men and sure enough Balboa slips into a depression and something of an existential crisis. Thankgoodness then for old adversary, turned friend Apollo Creed who tells Rocky to pick himself up, read up on Tigers and take himself to the beach for a bit of homo-erotic horseplay, then on to the ring to teach the new champ a damn good lesson...Rocky III may be a comment on the promise of the American ideal corrupted by its vast wealth and unrestrained capitalism. Then again that could be nonsense. In Rocky you've got the embodiment of the American dream gone soft and no longer possessing the spirit that was the source of his power and influence. He's reduced to commercial endorsements and expensive suites and even more embarrassingly, Wrestling Exibition fights. He's lost his heart and his self-respect, y'know the kind you only have when you're poor and he needs to get it back because at this point there's still an hour of the film left. The third film is a bit of a weird one because though perfectly watchable its got moments of supreme silliness. All of a sudden Rocky can't get anywhere near a ring without oiling himself up. Creed seems obsessed with the tie-in track and mentions it every five minutes and we learn that the only way to get your respect back is to do imitations of wild animals and jump about in the sand with the spray of the ocean suggestively foaming all over you. We're left with this rather strange situation in which the film is softened by the same commerical pressures that Rocky himself proved susceptible too. It's Rocky now as franchise - product and as a result there's none of the dramatic pretencions of early movies. It's strictly formula which is fine but it might leave you wondering where the series could go after this. Well Russia of course!",5,1,6,6 June 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Was that it?
","'It was awful!' - and that from the Potter loving Mrs Frames who had given an (inital)thumbs up to the previous three instalments but later, with two feet in a tub of cold water and a live wire dangling threateningly near by from your reviewer's own hand, conceded that they didn't hold up too well to repeat views. For her, Goblet of Fire just omitted too much of Rowling's book and fluffed the parts that were left. I didn't mind it so much, though I haven't read any of the novels (I'm over 18) and for that reason the film seemed to me OK - though a little patchy and let down by Radcliffe's half-grimace, half-gurning style of acting. Lacking Hermione's natural advantages he'll need to work bloody hard next time round to avoid looking like a new boy screen testing with the real actors.Having been dragged along, though like sex I haven't paid for it once, I was again relatively surprised to find myself sitting in a packed house with hardly a child in sight. You'd have thought they'd have brought the little wizard-loving sprites along to cover their own fanatical devotion to a set of kiddy books but after 3 flicks perhaps all pretence was left (with the tots) at home. What drives them to see it is another matter. Mrs Frames belongs to the Hype Guild of Great Britain (HGGB) and its a condition of her membership that she must immerse herself in everything that resembles a bandwagon, regardless of quality, which is why she's currently on her 5th I-Pod. Harry Potter for me is the sort of thing I might have loved as a child to which you could add Matricide and Wham bars, but in my roaring twenties it seems pillaged from better stories and possessive of the same tensile strength as urine. The last film was far more successful in its craft and tone whereas Mike Newell, who prior to this would have got no closer to a blockbuster than watching one at home on DVD, isn't nearly as assured with the material and not in possession of so talented an eye. Devoid of the fanaticism that seems to inflate these so-so stories, I'm rather tired of seeing each film with the promise of darker and deeper to come. When is this going to happen exactly? I could wait forever to find out. As Rowling's books get longer and more difficult to adapt my advice would be to dump them altogether and make an independent series based on the lead characters. Suggestions for future episodes include Harry Potter and the Turkish Prison, Harry Potter and the Hermione Granger Rape Case a.k.a. 'Dirty' Harry Potter and Harry Potter Goes Wild! Wait a minute, I think I'm beginning to feel the hype...",6,0,0,2 December 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," I hope this sequel is an illusion
","Expanding on bulls*it mythology can be a dangerous enterprise. The original Matrix merely hinted at the underlying metaphysical questions posed by its premise. In doing so it invited the comic book literate but you also suspect girlfriendless fan base to posit questions about the film's existential ideas. However this bloated and overwritten middle instalment attempts to shade in these areas with disastrous effect. Like Yoda on speed, the characters in this film spout third rate philosophy like there entire conception of English had been based on the Empire Strikes Back and those little bits of paper you get in fortune cookies. Where the original film kept it tight and merely alluded to the back-story, the back-story we discover in Reloaded (much like the Star Wars prequel trilogy) is a lot more interesting in our imagination than it is when its all explained. It would help if any of it made much sense but most of the dialogue is seemingly written with a view to inviting dense speculation and analysis from the internet community and thus imbuing the material with a depth it doesn't possess. This is a film that requires an editor. Its much too long, with some scenes dragging on while you check your watch. With pretencions of profundity the characters speculate about Neo's origins, the nature of existence, their function in the universe and so on. However, the Warchowski's aren't Nietzsche or Kant and frankly, should leave this kind of crap to genuine thinkers. People are going to this movie to see action and martial arts and thats what they should have concentrated on. Reloaded delivers here of course, but although its all more elaborate than before, its also less impressive simply because most of it seems dropped into the narrative for no reason. New characters are introduced but have little to do except turn up and do the obligatory fighting. This is a disappointing sequel, too long to be satisfying, not self-contained enough to stand on its own without Revolutions and too concerned with adding layers of shallow intellectualism to its status as pop-cultural myth to be engaging to its audience. As with Star Wars, its far more fun when the audience fill in the details- when the filmmakers do it they lose the simplicity that made the original enjoyable in the first place. For these reasons alone the Matrix Reloaded is like waking in the real world having experienced the joy of a computer generated illusion. You'll want to take a pill, forget about all this and return to the original as soon as possible.",4,0,0,24 May 2003
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Violence
","A tight and nicely pitched bit of boom bang-a-bang bang all the time with Brad Pitt and the impossibly eye catching Angelina Jolie as the couple drowning in the sort of domestic hell that Tyler Durden would have incinerated. What the couple don't know is that they're both assassins but someone else does find out and dispatches them to kill each other. That's it really. They find out, they fight, they exchange a few bitchy comments and destroy the matrimonial lair. Liman though is no slouch in the action department as he proved in the Bourne Identity and the couple bust each other up with enough destructive zeal to stop you getting bored, even if you're never exactly brimming with excitement. It's not much of comedy but there are a few mouth raising asides and Vince Vaughn is good value was Pitt's anxious friend and associate. A perfectly diverting two hours when all is said and done, sentiment free and worth seeing for Jolie's curves, the house is on fire moment and Seth from the O.C looking at an aggressive looking Pitt, wearing a fight club t-shirt, tied to a chair. Actually he didn't half look like Tyler did in the scene where Ed Norton was tied to that chair. Come to think of it, the Smith's shrine to unrestrained capitalism did go up in a firey ball of fury.",6,0,4,11 June 2005
War of the Worlds," Awesome Wells?
","The vast, cool and unsympathetic intelligence responsible for this latest version of H.G Wells story is a little too good at recreating the author's cold lesson in human humility. In many respects its a success - the relocation to modern day America works perfectly because its the superpower of the moment, as much the centre of present day civilisation as Wells' Victorian England. Therefore there's no better place on Earth for a bit of otherworldly extermination, no better backdrop to see social order breakdown and people take on the animal mentality that the author cynically described in his original Novella. Spielberg's decision to keep the invasion grounded from one character's perspective is also a smart move. Not only is this faithful to the old narrative but it manages to effortlessly dodge all the old alien invasion movie clichÃ©s, ensuring this isn't just a serious version of Mars Attacks. So as an update it works quite well and allows the Sugarland Express director to indulge in his talent for show-stopping spectacle and psychological giggery-pokery. So why only 6/10? Because Worlds is just a shade too cold for its own good. The diminutive Cruiser is fine but ONLY fine and Dakota Fanning continues to impress but on this occasion Spielberg's favourite old stand-by, the dysfunctional family doesn't deliver the goods, initially because we've hardly got to know them before they're on the run and that they're all just a little bit slight and uninvolving. The 'Berg is the real star of the show as he often is, handling the material with his usual deft touch and efficiency but this time, bereft of any emotional core, it plays in a fairly so-so kind of fashion. Technically there's no problem here but about an hour after this ended I caught Close Encounters on T.V and realised and what this movie lacked was all there - Warm Characterisation, a bit of breathing space to invest in the protagonists, a mountain of mash potato and a highly effective score by John Williams who here is disappointingly anonymous. Wells was famously dissatisfied with most adaptations of his work but I think he would have had a hard time deriding this one - the problem is that for once, a little modification might have brought it up a few notches.",6,1,3,4 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," SITH: Right letters, wrong order.
","Lucas' last visit to Planet Hype is a disappointing affair and provides final proof that his obsession with digital effects and the possibilities they allow has, in a disturbing parallel with his ill fated on screen protagonist, blinded him to whats really important - the storytelling fundamentals. Having now seen the third and final Star Wars prequel I'm as confused as ever by the hysteria it's generated, especially in light of the hyperbole that has followed this film into cinemas, not least by those whom have actually SEEN it. Inital reviews have been overwhelmingly positive with comments like 'Lucas recaptures the old magic' and endless variations on old chestnuts like 'a worthy addition to the Star Wara saga' and 'wonderful storytelling'. I'm here to tell you this is nonsense. Revenge of the Sith may be better than its two predecessors but contrary to what you may have read it doesn't address any of the fundamental flaws that mired those films nor can it claim to be a success in its own right as it fails to adequately resolve the series back story satisfactorily. Once again you have a movie in which two years are allocated for visual effects but comparatively little time is spent on character direction or the screenplay. Consequently Sith is doomed before a single pixel has been generated because no volume of visual splendour can touch up those performances or that dialogue. Lucas may think these things are unimportant, in fact he's on record as having described dialogue (astonishingly) as just another sound effect, seemingly having forgotten that audience's relate to and invest in characters not rendered spaceships and lightsaber noises. The acting here is uniformly atrocious with good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman looking as though they were terrified of the camera and loathe to speak the plodding words that have been forced into their mouths. Mimimalist direction plays a part sure but the actors themselves should take some responsibility for every cringe inducing moment. The stilted, slow delivery and the lack of any verifiable emotion serves only to blunt the impact of the stories various moments of 'high drama'. Helen Keller would have made a more communicative Annakin Skywalker than Hayden Christensen. Ian MaDarmid makes the best of the material but even he, this time having been tantalisingly placed at the forefront of proceedings, veers from effective hamming to simple embarrassment on a few occasions. A tighter plot is nevertheless laden with botched plot points and continuity errors. The Jedi purge for example comes at the execution (no pun intended) of the Emperor's 'order 66' which turns the cloned troopers on their Jedi masters. Fine but why hasn't this order been alluded to previously? A hint, a passing reference, a mention in Episode II, anything would have done but nothing until the moment itself?! Equally the double whammy of the Jedi's immortality via the force and Padme's death are poorly and thoughtlessly handled. Padme, taking her lead from the audience, apparently dies having 'lost the will to live', otherwise in perfect health. A midwife-droid tells Obi-Wan that he can't explain her condition which would be OK if there were any possibility the question may be answered later but with IV, V and VI in the can we now know it will never be addressed. Why set up a plot point you can't deal with? Utterly ridiculous. If Lucas is telling us she died of a broken heart he's officially and finally broken mine. The Jedi's immortality is also a fudge. Yoda tells Obi-Wan he must use his time in exile to gain the ability from no less than Qui-Gon. Assuming you accept that this has any internal story logic you might want to ask why or rather Qui the great man hasn't appeared to Obi-Wan previously, why just Yoda? In any event we now know why Yoda and Kenobi can do it, how you may ask, did Annakin learn? Palpatine made no mention of a Sith lord having the ability to bring THEMSELVES back from the dead. In fact the inconsistencies go on and on from Leia having memories of the mother she met for all of five seconds to the Death Star's embryonic appearance at the end prompting the question of just how long they actually take to build. Return of the Jedi suggests the turnover time is a great deal less than 20 years but why let what you've already established get in the way of a good story? Speaking of that story the devil is once again in the detail and if you look closely you can see him sticking two fingers up at you throughout the running time. The Jedi are still mirth inducingly slow to see the bleedin' obvious and as most of them are about as charismatic as plant life it's difficult to feel sympathy when they're brutally slain. So Star Wars in finally all over and so too I think, is its reputation. Millions felt it belonged to them but one man knew they were wrong and brutally proved it. This 2nd set of films was intended to broaden and deepen the series' mythology but in fact its betrayed the source of its own success, namely its fans, by replacing the dynamism, adventure and memorable characters of those films with self-important and ill-conceived prequels which have weakened the series overall and tarnished the older episodes by locking them into a back story with little or no emotive resonance. What you're left with then, when all the hype and related nonsense finally fritters away, is a six act movie in which the first act is unwatchable, the second is patchy but poor and the third ups the tempo but makes a mess of its promise. It's all very well telling people it gets better in the second 7 hours but seriously, who's going to want to watch a movie like that? Over to you world.",6,1,2,19 May 2005
Shooter," He shoots, he scores!
","WARNING: contains bloody obvious spoilers.Marky Mark is back and watch out, this time he's got a gun! The former boy bander stretches himself as an emotionally anaemic solider who goes into early retirement after a botched Ethiopian mission (another one!) and is recruited by Danny Glover, here lisping for no good reason whatsoever, to out think a would-be presidential assassin who like Walhberg, is a marksman par excellence. Of course if you don't spot that the former rapper is being set up very early on and that said marksman is a figment of Glover's imagination, you're an idiot and deserve the bullet even more than our hero. Framed for an assassination (he's a expert in being invisible but manages to be photographed doing a recce of assassination sites everywhere), our man goes on the run but it's not long before he's, er, enlisting the help of the wanton and see through top wearing Kate Mara, the wife of his dead former partner, to expose the conspiracy and pop a cap in the bad guys.Shooter is great fun, if formulaic to the point of fracture. People actually have lines like 'he's supposed to be the best' and the stab at political zeitgeist sampling is as clumsy as our hero's delivery, Walberg having swallowed Stephen Hawkins' computerised voice box for reasons never explained.Walhberg's delivery is as as quick as machine gun fire and just as indiscriminate in its victims. He sounds like a replicant with a damaged emotion chip - in fact he's so dry that he could be a boy reading out lines from a play in an English lesson. Nevertheless there's something about his faux seriousness that really entertains and although he's consistently as animated as Peter Falk's glass eye, there's an reassuring bluntness to the Marky Mark cinematic experience that delivers, just as Jack Nicolshon is always Jack, Sid James Sid and Michael Caine, er, well...Having said all that this is never offensively bad, in fact as alluded to already, the Markster is quite endearing, if a little trigger happy and Ned Beatty, in a thought you were dead bit part, is appropriately slimy as the bent Senator who you long for Walhberg to give serious lead poisoning. It entertainingly veers from a patriotic exercise in defending democratic ideals to a not so crypto-fascist manifesto for dealing with corrupt lawmakers. Rule of law? Just load up and tell me where they're going to be.Fast paced, fun and packed the occasionally pleasing set-piece, Shooter is much better than a bullet in the head but whoever told Danny Glover to put a cotton bud against his lower lip and slur every other word deserves a visit from Walhberg in the very near future.",6,1,6,20 April 2007
Back to the Future Part II," The 'difficult' second film
","Sixteen years on and I can remember it like yesterday...which is handy because the real yesterday was 'king dreadful. I was swaggering down Causeway Head, Penzance's premier street as its the only one that contains a cinema AND a chip shop - in my hand a thick wedge of pornographic magazines. My Destination? 'The Matrix', an incomplete garage where myself and two friends stored a hoard bought using homeless men given extra for cigarettes. As I walked past the Savoy I saw a coming soon poster for the Back to the Future sequel. I had no idea it was even being made. It was a fantastic moment. The original was one of my all time favourite things and the only one I could enjoy with my Mother in the room. When I finally saw it 3 or 4 months later I was entertained but held reservations which hold up to this day and that, lucky people that you are, I'll share with you now. Immediately it was apparent that there were some problems. One, Claudia Wells had become Elizabeth Shue and no-one had noticed - worrying because it was the original actresses good looks that had effectively saved Marty's bacon when his assertion that 'she's beautiful' had caused him to whip out the clock-tower flyer with its precious future information. Two, Chrispin Glover had chosen not to participate. Why was this allowed to happen? He was a key supporting character in the first film and though they could clearly get round it with a lot of soft long distance shots and layers of makeup his absence left a hole in the ensuing two episodes. I'd love to see the original paradox script which presumably had him in it. Three, it was too complicated and so packed with plot that you never really had the opportunity to sit back and breathe it in like the first film. You know it's been retrospectively plotted when you have to insert a scene into the original epilogue to make it work. Four, continuity. Michael J Fox's appearance in the 1985 film is a matter of record as its, er, on film, so you'd think it wouldn't be a stretch for just one person to observe that the diminutive man child had different hair. For those of you that think this is pedantry, YES IT IS and wacha going'do about it? Some nights all I can think about is a digitally tinkering but thats a different subject entirely and not something we should go into here. So part II is good fun, cleverly conceived and all the rest of it but it just doesn't have the heart of the first and of course it doesn't really work as a self-contained instalment because its essentially half a film - a 108 minute setup for the better, more satisfying part III. 'Tis a comedy lets not forget so its worth mentioning some good jokes - Nixton's fifth term in the alternate future, the black and decker hydrated pizza, Doc Brown's 'Women!' monologue and of course 'Ooh la la!' OK, the product placement is disgraceful but you can use the 'minority report' defence (which presumably the producers saw coming) and argue that it adds a real-worldly dimension to the future. That said, Pepsi did very well out of the futures and that would be fine 'cept it tastes terrible. Its nice that you have a sequel that does something different from its predecessor and credits the audience with a bit of intelligence, plus it was blatantly robbed of the best-visual Oscar (went to the Abyss would you believe). Excellent though flawed entertainment.",7,0,1,19 January 2006
The Queen," Letting daylight in upon magic
","The Queen is an unusual proposition because the events it dramatises pose similar concerns for the filmmakers to those experienced by the characters. The emphasis is on striking the right note Â– the challenge for Helen Mirren, reflecting the conundrum faced by the real monarch back yonder, is presenting the monarch in the best light possible. In a mirror of September 1997, the trick here was to avoid some potentially disastrous hurdles and struggle for the right balance.As a viewer I have difficulties of my own watching the Queen. The constitutional monarchy is as gross anachronism in a modern state that has pretensions of being a meritocracy and for that matter a fully fledged democracy. It embodies some fairly grotesque principles, not least hereditary privilege and deference to an institution that personifies inequality, ironically held in the highest regard by the strata of society that is least well off. If you could design a system from scratch it's hard to imagine a model that would seem more ridiculous. Those who defend the idea and indeed the Royal family itself usually do so because so embedded is the class system in Britain, bleeding as it does into the every vein and capillary of British life, that something in their breeding tells them they're inferior and lack the mythic aura to hold the highest office in the land. It'd be like letting a chimp fly an aircraft. This inverted snobbery hits at the collective immaturity that allows the British people to subordinate themselves and preserve elites. Anything that threatens their existence is therefore desirable. On the other hand, public reaction to the death of Diana was one of the most hysterical and outright bizarre outpourings of public grief in modern times. An inexplicable gush of sentimentality that gripped the nation as though someone had put ecstasy into the water supply. Papers, furious of the Queen's typically measured and withdrawn response, spoke of her subjects 'suffering'. Martin Lewis fought back tears on the BBC news. Millions left flowers and cried their eyes out in public. Nothing had been seen like it before or since. Anything approaching normal behaviour had obviously forgotten to wear its seat belt too.So unusually, I watched the Queen both sympathetic to the confusion and outright indignation she presumably felt, at having to cow to this ludicrous collective nervous breakdown and the publics legitimate right to demand her compliance and example in a time of so called national crisis. Stephen Frears' film respects both arguments.Helen Mirren, taking on the unenviable job of making the Queen a three dimensional human being, successfully presents Elizabeth as both dutiful and understandably perturbed by the public mood. Whether you believe in the monarchy or not, it's hard not to feel a pang of sympathy for Liz as she attempts to reconcile her own values with those of her equally insane subjects. The flip side of course is that the public comes off less well, epitomised in no small part by Cherie Blair and Alistair Campbell, representing the kind of cynicism that gives apologists for the status quo the Oxygen for their reactionary arguments. They decry the fact she's out of touch, a funny sort of criticism when it's that very fact that's kept the Monarchy going throughout the 20th century. The public's hypocrisy was berating the Royals for acting like the rest of us Â– divorcing, having affairs, etcÂ…, what Bagehot famously referred to as letting daylight onto magic, and then lambasting them for not acting in step with Joe Public when the occasion demanded it.Martin Sheen, reprising his role as Tony Blair, following the TV drama 'The Deal', is equal to Mirren in inhabiting his character completely, transcending mere impersonation. Frears pokes gentle fun at the New Labour figurehead, the scenes in his self-named Newcastle football shirt designed to show a little bit of the self-gratification that marked his early years in office. The closing scenes with Mirren, in which she warns him that the public are a fickle bunch whose affection can disappear faster than a princess in a Paris tunnel, hint at the hubris and the inevitable fall from grace. The script succeeds best however is showing the clash of Blair's new politics with the old establishment. The film mischievously toys with those in reverence to both worlds with James' Cromwell's Prince Phillip aghast at the homosexuals attending Diana's funeral highlighting aristocratic opposition to changing social attitudes, while Blair's lack of substance is hinted at when he gets a ringing endorsement from Tracy Ullman, phoning in her gushing tribute from Los Angeles in a CNN interview.Ultimately the film is a bit of a valentine to its subject matter. So what if The Queen mourns a stag more than the mother of her grandchildren Â– Blair sums the argument up a nutshell when he launches a tirade at a flippant Alistair Campbell. Diana lacked the selflessness and devotion to the institution that the Queen, perhaps alone, had upheld. 'She (Diana) threw what she (The Queen) offered back in her face and then flaunted it in front of the media, undermining everything she stands for' is Blair's and the filmmakers assessment of the martyred princess. It's hard to disagree and harder yet to understand what an odd people we are for caring about it all in the first place. Sometimes it seems that cut off from the rest of society really is the sanest place to be.Incidentally, in an interesting bit of life imitating art symmetry, Mirren Â– a republican by all accounts, withered like Blair, another moderniser, when accepting her Oscar. 'Ladies and gentleman, the Queen!' she proudly announced, like she was proposing a toast to an invisible set of dinner party guests. It was wince inducing and grotesque but good shorthand for the establishment reverence that guarantees the monarch's continued existence. Will we ever learn? The events of 1997 suggest we'd have to grow up first.",7,0,0,19 May 2007
Bruce Almighty," There is no God
","High Concept bulls***, peppered with Smaltz and a ruinous injection of sentimentality from Jim Carrey and the usual suspects. A one note premise for Carrey's familiar blend of hyperactive slapstick, gurning and shouting. Basically this is the script for Liar Liar with a different conceit. Once again through the course of the story Carrey redeems himself by realising whats really important and putting others first (Its the family stupid). Ahhhhhh. We're asked (again) to feel for the woman (this time Jennifer Aniston)who fell for this immature misfit but now realises hes not interested in a mature, responsible relationship. Well I say tough. They fell for him because he made them laugh of course, after all as God reminds Carrey in a scene saturated in back slapping egomania from the star in question, Carrey makes the whole world laugh - thats his gift. Oh yeah? Well God why isn't it working on me? I'd pay him $20M just to retire.Spending time with Jim Carrey in this kind of thing is like spending two hours in a public place with your highly embarrassing friend who insists on showing off and acting like a six year old. Your desperate to be somewhere else and during a film in which the jokes, hilarious stuff like urinating dogs and Monkeys exiting arses and so on, disappear 30 minutes before the end, I looked to the exit more than once and prayed for divine intervention - a lightning bolt hitting the projection room or something, which i'm sad to say never came. This kind of star vehicle by numbers is nothing short of the work of Satan himself and I encourage you to avoid it at all costs. Incidentally, and I don't suppose it matters, but should God necessarily be the Christian God by default in this picture? Isn't America a land of multiple faiths? Incidentally if you have faith I suggest you get on your knees tonight and pray for no more of this witless vapid sludge. If you hear the reply 'Alrighty then', atheism may be the way forward.",2,4,9,4 July 2003
Casino Royale," A masterclass in how to save an endangered series
","History is littered with decisive reversals, one immediately thinks of the Nazis at Stalingrad or Liverpool in the 2005 Champions league final but to these we can now add Casino Royale; as complete and affirming a rebuke to the Pierce Brosnan quartet of derivative, self-parodic Bonds as you could dare hope for. It is, following 2002's ludicrous Die Another Day, nothing short of a cinematic miracle Â– a creative shot of heroin to Bond's dick, as coarse and as eye opening as Le Chiffe's rope Â– a global audience strapped to their seat less chair and forced to atone for their patronage of the Brosnan stupidity, a rumoured title incidentally for his aborted fifth entry. Yes, welcome to Dalton's revenge. The change of fortune for the series is incredible given where we were only four years and one film ago. All the more amazing given the previous film's box office clout, Royale is a rare instance of the filmmakers looking beyond the numbers and thinking of their audience and the result deserves huge credit, not least because it's a brave thing to have done but also because in abandoning the expedient option and simply trotting out another piece of pantomime stupidity, they've talked up to Bond's global constituency of fans and potentially laid the foundations for a new and exciting era for the series.The 'fans' are an issue here because whoever they are, God alone knows what they'll think of the rougher tone and the lack of camp and innuendo that's blighted previous instalments. In their place we have, given the treatment of Fleming's previous novels, an incredible faithful adaptation, tweaked certainly but losing none of the cold, ironical and brutal characterisation that defined the author's work. Timothy Dalton, until now the best of the bunch, went some way toward putting the literary Bond on screen but was constrained somewhat by an established formula which he invigorated but on that occasion didn't break. When he pushed it further in Licence to Kill he was branded a failure. Daniel Craig has no such difficulties. In sourcing the first novel, Craig is free to pretend his predecessors didn't exist and obliterates them with a performance ripped from the page. Series purists may argue he's too cold, lacks humour, fails to temper the nastiness with wit but this is incidental, lazy criticism. Craig ties Connery for the definitive portrayal because whatever's chucked at him he can argue, and be the first to be accurate on this point, that he's Ian Fleming's James Bond Â– something that only Dalton and the aforementioned Scotsman could have got close to.Hyperbole aside, its fair to say that Craig doesn't so much p*ss on Brosnan's chips as deep fry them in his own urine. It really is the difference between Bollinger Grande Annee and a glass of Tesco's own but then these are two very different takes not just on the character but on his entire world Â– the series has been completely rebuilt and the effect is as glorious as it exhilarating. Gone is the sub-Austin Powers regurgitation of old motifs and plots and in their place we have Fleming's story, short enough to be beefed up with modern action set-pieces but rooted in the characters of Bond and Vesper Lynd to the extent that 90% of the script writer's work has been done for them. The key word here is restraint because in sticking to the book and resisting the temptation to work in moronic puns, playing cards that double as plastic explosives and brain dead supporting cleavage, Purvis & Wade (with help from Paul Haggis), who's previous efforts were so poor many suspected they'd been replaced by a computer called BANG (the B-movie Action Narrative Generator), have rehabilitated themselves with a plot that really moves, dialogue that occasionally zings and a structure that effortlessly integrates the book's action-lite narrative with the meatier requirements of the contemporary action event movie. Judy Dench, confusingly returned here as M and consequently raising some awkward questions about series continuity, looks like she's in a different set of films and the new lease of life is infectious Â– various sequences imbued with a immediacy and violence missing from a generations worth of Bond adventures. Its not perfect Â– the opening titles are paired down but look decidedly basic, like the introduction to a sadistic version of Play your Cards Right. Its arguably, like yours truly, a fraction too long and the product placement though scaled down still offends but Poker never held your attention like this in a mainstream action adventure and the set up for the next film leaves a sense of anticipation that speaks volumes for the intelligent and well judged film that's been made here.For fans of the series this should be an invigorating shot in the arm but the experience of Dalton forces us to sound a note of caution. There is no doubt that Casino Royale is one of the best Bonds, ranking with From Russia with Love, OHMSS and the Living Daylights amongst the series vintage instalments but the experience of Lazenby's film and the two Timothy's shows us that audiences have historically, in the US at least, rejected the paired down, serious takes on the character. In these slightly more cynical times lets hope that Fleming's 1950's character has finally caught up with the mood of his audience. The filmmakers have done their part after all and Craig deserves to be a worldwide smash so if this isn't the start of as long and lucrative era for the series you'll only have yourselves to blame. No really, there's no excuse now Â– Royale is the Bond movie some of us have been waiting on for years, the only thing that can ruin the series now is the stupidity of its audience and in that event you really will deserve to be patronised with Brosnan like nonsense. Craig deserves better than that and so do we.",9,1,4,18 November 2006

","*Contains some Spoilers*Is less really more? Thats the question you're left with after watching this so so sequel to the 2000's X-Men. Its bigger, longer, its got more characters and a bigger budget, but is it any damn good?The hype aside, the problem with X2 is that it just isn't particularly interesting or inspiring. There are so many characters on show here that none enjoy any real depth or 3-dimensonality. Despite pretentions of a serious plot surrounding an attempted presidential assassination by mutants, precipitating a witchunt by a hawk within the US military, General Stryker (Brain Cox), the story is never more than a hook upon which to hang a series of solid but never groundbreaking setpieces. Between the action sequences is paracuted the odd halfhearted chracter moment which for the most part underlines the allegory of intolerence (in case you hadn't got it yet) such as Bobby Drake (Iceman) visiting his parents and having to tell them hes a mutant (the shame!). Under the circumstances perhaps it would have been easier to tell them he was gay. Somehow turning a cup of coffee into a frozen block doesn't have the same emotional impact. While the chracters are either looking lost or standing polietly in the background waiting for the story to involve them in any significant fashion, the auidence is left with the feeling that something good from the original film is missing here. This is undoubtedly the interplay between Ian Mackellen as Magneto and Patrick Stewart as Xaiver. Fair play to the filmmakers for not simply repeating the plot of the first film but without that central conflict to anchor the action we are left with Cox as villian who frankly is a bit of damp squib.Despite the running time, X2 never feels like it got its teeth into a story with any emotional or character depth before it arrives at its inevitable effects laden conclusion which, I can reveal in common with all other reviews of this picture, contains the death of a major character. Were she not a bit of a cypher in the first place it may have been more moving. As it was I found myself distracted by some ropey CGI work toward the end and the somewhat 'is that it?' finale. John Ottman's score is a lot better than Kamen's was for the orginal in that Ottman bothers to include a melody, but its still virtually anonymous and you'll be hard pushed to recall single theme 10 minutes after the end credits have rolled. Singer directs with some style and energy but all in all its all a bit superficial and overlong to really be construed as great. Better then, than many of the blockbusters of recent years but still wanting when held up to similar fare made in the late 70's and early 80's (Superman II it ain't). Call me intolerent but they don't make 'em like they used to.Oh, as a footnote to this review may I be the first to petition Fox for the inclusion of Richard Pryor in X3. Thanks.",Null,0,0,7 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Two Hour Techo-Shock
","So many millions of reviews have been written of this movie that its hard to imagine what else there us to say about it. Iconic? Sure. The special effects, certainly. Cannabilised from westerns, Japanese folk lore, 30's adventure serials, yep, heard it - seen it. We could talk about incest, the minimalist direction, the slumming Alec Guinness, Lucas's tone deaf ear for dialogue or the double entendres that cause the entire screenplay to list toward the Carry Ons but instead lets talk about what this thing is REALLY all about.Star Wars is a film about domestic violence and sexual abuse. Don't believe me? Well it just goes to show that no matter how many times you've seen it, you haven't paid attention once. Lucas may have had the intellectual chutzpah to take the subject head on but his ability to hide the subtext amongst the dogfights and the cod-mysticism, is meticulous - daring even, and has escaped serious documentation. Tim Roth would do it better with his 1999 film 'The War Zone' but his debt to Lucas, for his tale of a sexually abusive father can not be be overstated. This is a film about childhood dreams, the destruction of the family, the sexual confusion born of repressed abuse and the gradual shift to confronting that sordid past. Lucas sets out his stall immediately with the infamous 'a long time ago in a galaxy far far away' card, deliberately evocative of childhood fairy tales and fantasy. What follows acts as an ironic counterpoint to this innocent introduction with the arrival of the Star Destroyer, a searing phallus forcefully pushing its way across the frame; its size and intimidatory potential calculated to mirror the perception of the Father's reproductive strongbox from the child's perspective. Symbolically we've barely grasped the significance of this opening scene and its horrifying implications until we realise that the pursuing vessel contains Vader: The violent parent with the abusive past, chasing his now teenage daughter under the pretext of searching for architectural blueprints- a hollow ruse. Vader, we come to realise from his monstrous appearance- an evil black visage, is a deranged psychopath, barely human and in denial of his parental status (he doesn't mention it once) and its this, Lucas suggests, that allows him to later administer an interstellar confection of drugs to Leia to gain her absolute 'co-operation', when she is held prisoner on the Death Star and is subjected to her Father's intergalactic insertions. We don't see it of course; Lucas's camera joins the complicit guards in the corridor outside, but the look of recognition, horror and resignation on her face, speaks to a forgotten childhood of sustained attacks. It's no coincidence that the man's speciality is constricting the flow of air to his victims. Prior to his mechanisation, its all too easy to see a gloved hand covering a small mouth; a size and weight advantage exploited for sadistic ends - a mother cowering and crying in an adjacent room. The dark side indeed. So why has Luke and Leia been forced to disavow their blood-ties and take refuge on the other worlds and in Leia's case, under an assumed identity? Split up as children and hidden from their father by Guinness' guilt ridden Jedi Knight (of whom more later) to protect them from his predatory impulses, they have begun the movie apparently unaware of their childhood horror. It is repressed as the Freudian paradigm would suggest, in the sibling's unconscious. However, several scenes hint at what we can only imagine...Luke's Aunt and Uncle who have raised him since his impromptu separation from his parents, react with horror when Luke looks like emulating his father. Little wonder. Anakin's shift to the 'dark side'(note the constitution of his mother as a sexual object in Episode II's under the covers scene), a euphemism for his descent into infanto-perversion, lead to the absence of Luke and Leia's mother from which we can read consistent beatings with bricks wrapped in stocking, the branding of flesh with a cow-iron and ultimately murder, from which an eruption of sodomy gushed forth like a Mustafian geyser. Skywalker the elder was an animal,Lucas intones via notably disgusted composition, who did unimaginable damage as his old friend Obi-Wan looked on, slow to act and gripped by a failing of moral courage. Obi-Wan DID act of course but too late to halt the traumatic tide. His scenes in his Tatooine dwelling set up an interesting ambiguity in which we're invited to speculate as to whether or not he participated in, or was tempted to do the same before his moral compass finally pointed north. The more we know about Vader, the more it makes a frightening amount of sense. His own mother murdered by sand people, he allowed himself to be wooed by a princess with a predilection for men she met as children and then allowed himself to be groomed by a leering father figure who we know to be interested in the exploitation and subordination of youngsters for unspecified 'evil' purposes. In conclusion Star Wars is at turns both touching (the brother's noble rescue of the sister from their father's clutches) and horrifying (witness the scene in which Daddy literally and metaphorically destroys Leia's world - one of many allegorical episodes in which the psychological crimes of the past are represented in the present). Its a brave, misunderstood film that doesn't flinch from the exploration of its sinister subject matter and we can only hope that subsequent DVD editions will tackle the film's issues head on..",7,1,2,30 May 2005
300," I intend to have you even if it must be burglary!
","Do you dislike homosexuals? Really? Even now, in this enlightened age? Well your rampant, ingrained homohatred may be itself loathed by every liberal commentator on the planet but spankgoodness you've still got a home in Hollywood. That's right, in the dream factory no-one had even thought of buggery until some time in the early nineties when Tom Hanks tepidly kissed his lover but even then the story had a nasty twist. Hanks may have been in a loving relationship but thanks to his cocoa shunting he had contracted AIDS and would die. Nevermind! Fast forward a few years and we have the 300 - a homo-erotic fantasy no less that simultaneously cries 'kill all homosexuals' while getting drunk on a gay saturated orgy of cartoon violence. Basically it goes something like this: The virile Spartans, we know they're virile because they kill wolves and screw their women, are told to roll over by the Persians lead by androgynous gay icon King Xerses. Leonaydas, a real man and don't you forget it, tells the flamboyantly decorated, well dressed Persians that they can take their threats and shove them where the sun is obscured by arrow fire - at least he would if they didn't enjoy it so much. The social lepers and lunatic mystics won't sanction a war so the King grabs 300 of his best warriors and moves to head off the incoming Persian army, even though they're rumoured to number in the millions.What follows is roughly 90 minutes of slaughter in which the Persians - gay, grotesque mutants or both, are given a taste of Spartan steel - real men showing these limp wristed imperialists how to fight. Sure, they may only have 300 men but with 1 real man worth roughly 200,000 ear pierced Persians, its like shooting fish in a barrel...only easier. The thing about this is that its all beautifully rendered, CGI crayons scribbled large but there's more depth in thimble of water. Fans of slow motion, painted in blood spray and decapitation will need to keep their legs crossed. The rest of us should wince at the Xerses/Leonydas buggery scene (you'll know it when you see it), Xerses constant references to hedonism and kneeling down in front of him, you can theorise his motives for this on your own and the blatant gaffe - namely that the last part of the story is narrated by a character whose left the scene of the action. How does he know what happened exactly? Did someone e-mail him some clips? All in all a very strange experience.",5,11,24,26 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Banter, Alba and expensive special effects paid for by cynical advertisers
","...but wasn't it fun! Well..a bit. I liked Alba's jumpsuit! For the most part though Fantastic Four (note the irritating loss of the group's personal pronoun)is a photo-chemical womb incubating a stillborn celluloid-foetus. It just might be the most cynically commercial movie you've seen in years. In fact, if your one of the gazillion companies(including Fox of course who made it in the first place) who paid up front to get the human torch on ESPN or the Thing to wear Nikes, then you must be delighted to watch a flick in which the only real characters are the corporate sponsors and the only reason to keep watching is the (vain) hope that Jessica will take off her clothes prematurely before she becomes translucent. Sure, its colourful, inoffensive stuff - cine-ice cream you might say (and even if you wouldn't, I have) but these comic book flicks don't have to be so light do they? X-men, which began this noughties marvel onslaught, had vague pretencions of substance, Batman Begins wasn't entirely mindless - it doesn't have to be this way y'know. In fact watching the Four, you're reminded of why the film snobs hate Hollywood. Its Crude, over blown commercial candy floss with admittedly likable stars who get to do very little but joke around in the kind of self-satisfied tongue in cheek style we all despise. Fox should remember that the kind of limp and fluffy Eighties comic-flicks this often resembles lead to a death of these movies toward of the end of that decade. No more of this please.",4,14,23,2 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Give that man a hand....
","Ice, freezing cold, swamps, a bit of incest and severed limbs, yes its my last holiday alright and by an extraordinary coincidence some of the key points in The Empire Strikes Back.TESK named in the days when Lucasfilm could name a film without causing people to break into fits of uncontrolled laughter, is a terrific sequel to Star Wars. The second/fifth instalment improves on the original in almost every respect. Secure in the knowledge that the film had generated sufficient returns (apparently)to be extended to trilogy form, the scope of the saga both broadened and deepened here.Two things work in the film's favour in this respect. Firstly is Lucas's decision not to direct the second film, apparently due to the on set struggles encountered making the first. Oh happy day. Kersner adds a layer of psychological depth to the characterisations allowing for the darker elements of the story to more fully realised. Dialogue isn't a problem either this time round thanks to Lucas forsaking writing duties in favour of Leigh Brackett and Lawerence Kasdan. Most of what ended up on screen is due to Kasdan as Brackett died of Cancer in 1979, having completed her first draft. Her connection with directors like Howard Hawkes and Film Noir is still evident though, and her contribution to the saga is the dark edge this film has thats sorely missed from other episodes. Kasdan safe pair of hands ensures the proceedings sound as good as they possibly can with a series of highly memorable lines, most of which emanate from Darth Vader.As a self-contained film the only problem with EMPIRE is that it suffers slightly from middle child syndrome. Its too open ended to be fully satisfying and doesn't trouble itself to reintroduce elements from the first film assuming, probably correctly it must be said, that everyone will have seen This New Title is Hopeless. Looking back on the film now you have to wonder how much of the story was really pre-planned. Its often suggested by Lucas that he had it all mapped out in advance but i'm not so sure. Was Vader always Luke's Dad? Was Leia always Luke's sister? The ending suggests yes because they can communicate through the force but hang on, didn't she lay a big incestuous kiss on him back on Hoth? Thank god they didn't have sex! Imagine explaining that away in Jedi. One for the super special edition George?All in all its great stuff all the way from Hoth to the Bespin, via Degobar of course. After this Yoda packed, surprise laden instalment it must be hard to imagine how the series could ever go off the rails but the blue elephant in Jabba's palace was only one film away...oh and Vader's death...oh yes and then there were those teddy bears weren't there? Wait a minute, i'd forgotten the Phantom Mena-",8,0,1,17 June 2003
Sin City," Pop Art
","Every year we're lucky enough have a fresh comic book adaptation forced down our throats like one of Buffalo Bill's chrysalises but here's something a bit different - a comic book adaptation of a movie. Sin City is a paper to celluloid transfer for Frank Miller's bleak Film Noir pastiche, now itself a Noir but one with a level of stylisation unprecedented in the genre. Rodrigeuz and Miller have fashioned a movie in which every shot is a meticulous recreation of the source graphic novels. The ontology of these shots even mirror the books because it's all been painted in using computer graphics. The plot, three stories set in a metropolis of human filth and brutality is pitched, as you might expect in the event of having the author as Co-director and screenwriter, perfectly in a recreative style that renders the men as aggressive, nihilistic, tortured characters loyal only to themselves and their own moral code and women as objects of lust - sexual objects through and through. Fans of Film Noir should love it frankly - it's all moody streets lit in shadow (though not really of course), voice-over narration, murky criminality and femme fatales. The misogyny will be unpalatable for some but that's the genre kids, this isn't a documentary and such criticism has no place in this kind of movie. The male oriented approach that the material demands allows for a great deal of violence which I enjoyed enormously. On the subject of the women incidentally, they're as gorgeous as the men are aggressive and Lucille's breasts in particular deserve to be awarded a couple of Oscars in-addition to the striking visual effects which mix beautifully toned chiaroscuro virtual sets with some striking and clever use of colour. If there's any criticism to be had its that the film's strength, its rigidly faithful recreation of the source material could also be construed as its weakness. For all its energy and vivid visuals it lacks depth, inevitable when your characters are direct recreations of comic book characters. They're types rather than fully three dimensional human beings and so lack the humanity of the heroes or rather antiheroes that populated the great Noirs of the 40's. Sin City also has the occasional slow moment and some moments of humour that feel like false notes in an otherwise watertight production. Not perfect then but when you consider that this is the first movie since Beaty's Dick Tracy (1990) that has successfully presented itself as a living comic book and goes further than that film ever could, its something of a new sub-genre and if the sequels are crafted with the same care and attention to detail as this film then we should be in for a bit of a treat - the visual equivalent of a giant slab of chocolate cake. It's a bit too insubstantial for my taste but I can't say I didn't enjoy visiting Sin City and its lavishly created world.",7,3,6,6 June 2005
Braveheart," Monty Python's History of Britain
","The colonial chip on Mel Gibson's shoulder is so large in this pure Hollywood re-imagining of English-Scottish history that more often than not it threatens to cave in one side of the director's body, leaving him a crippled, diseased ghoul dragging the divided dead flesh through the mud, trying to say 'Freedom' through a sore covered, misshapen mouth. Unfortunately this didn't happen to Gibson, instead his survived untouched to give us this take on English aggression, so one sided and ludicrous it could have been filmed by Dr Joseph Goebbels' film bureau Â–in fact much like it exists in the Nazi's back catalogue. This skirts around the truth about Braveheart, namely that it's the product of a filmmaker/actor who's an abhorrent anti-Semite, right wing bigot and drunk who's barely disguised prejudice masks what can only be generously described as a selective attitude toward repression and the subjugation of entire peoples. Substitute the Scottish for the Jews for example and it's hard to imagine the pendulum swinging quite so far toward the persecuted. It's okay to paint the English as caricatures of course because it's set in the 13th century and who cares about the contemporaneous message when it's smeared in the long long ago, right? Tell that to the Scots. Gibson's tale of the boo-hiss moustache twirling Anglo-Saxons raping their women, hanging their manfolk and the like, went a long a way to reigniting the fervent and somewhat pernicious strain of nationalism that has always lain at the heart of the Scottish psyche. Finally here was the movie that said that anti-English bigotry was okay, even to be encouraged Â– a green light for the simpleminded. Yes, that's right my wee lads and lassies, all that crap your Mum and Dad told you about the English being arrogant, domineering scum who'd repressed your people for hundreds of years had now received the patronage of film. That's even better than reality isn't it? In any event once it's on film it's almost true anyway surely so even if the film's thrust is dishonest and the stuff of folklore invention it hardly matters. Gibson, with his blue face paint and poster-boy speeches for freedom (as long as you're a gentile of course) waved the flag for imagined tyranny in a country that had benefited from the Union with England financially and culturally for 300 years. The likes of the SNP, the political wing of Scottish bigotry and that occasional patriot, the tax exile Sean Connery all leaped on the bandwagon ensuring Gibson's iconic status from Berwick to Banff. The problem and I'm sorry to break this to any Celtic readers, is that photographing a propaganda piece with reality left to watch from behind the camera doesn't make any of it true. Gibson's film may be effectively packaged, romantically scored and crafted to stoke the fire of audience hatred but beyond all of that its true significance lies in the revealing hand of its director and the reaction of the people it purports to represent. Ironically the only ones to emerge from the film with any dignity are the vilified English Â– a patient audience if ever there was one.",5,4,9,11 November 2006
Donnie Darko," As nose as the plane on your face
","What is Donnie Darko all about, I mean really? I don't know and if anyone tells you they do they're a bastard liar because its one of those head-scratching setups designed to generate speculative musing on the film's thematic preoccupations. Broadly, said themes are philosophical and far reaching - the nature of being, place in the universe type questions, in other words impossible to satisfactorily resolve to any degree and if thats the kind of fantasy that makes you neck a bottle of Stolie and then forcefully cups your genitals then Darko is probably one of the best films of its type ever conceived, destined to be mulled over and picked apart for a long time, unless that is you've made the mistake of watching the idiot's guide, sorry Directors Cut that extracts all the delicious ambiguity and joins all the dots for lazy viewers. So there you have it - funny, touching, intelligently scripted, great soundtrack, emotionally stimulating, Swayze getting hauled in for child pornography - everything many films promise but don't deliver, all on the same bill!

Back to the Future," Delorean took cocaine
","Back to the Future concerns itself with an accidental trip into the past facilitated by a converted Delorean Sports Car. What isn't fully explored is the role that poor production values, industrial incompetence and the subsidies of the British Taxpayer, propping up a failing and corrupt American adventure capitalist, played in Marty Mcfly's near-on temporal suicide and submission to incest.The time machine was the product of substandard labour from a ill-trained Ulster work force. In an area where zealots and murderers had ruined the local economy in the pursuit of an imagined community but with an all-consuming disdain for democracy and the value of human life, Delorean had stepped in, not for altruistic purposes but because of tax breaks afforded to him by the then Labour Government who were desperate to do something about the stifling level of provincial unemployment. If these men couldn't get jobs then they might be tempted to take up arms and join the mob, knee capping young men under the pretext of collusion of the Unionists and the British Army or, if there was no such man, kidnap mothers in front of their children and shoot them in the head. Thus mainland British taxpayers, who worked hard and had no part in the religious hatred that had ruined this community, began to have their cash syphoned off for the sake of a PR initiative. At stake - the vanity and greed of John Delorean, a man who saw the local fat, semi-literate workforce with their half-baked, bigoted ideals as the perfect contingent to fashion his overpriced, poorly designed sports car. The stainless steel construction would later be cited as conducive to allowing the mechanism of time travel to take place but in practice it was the cars poor acceleration and botched circuitry that would prove more decisive when Marty was forced to flee for his life from Libyan terrorists. Marty's odyssey into the past nearly wiped out his existence and could have lead to sexual intercourse with his mother. At the root of it all we may look to the folly of cheap Labour, poor management and a cheated British electorate.Some good laughs.",10,1,2,16 February 2004
V for Vendetta," The vendetta is against the audience
","..and you might wonder what you did to deserve it if you're forced to sit through this imbecilic, pretentious candy floss. If Brazil and Nineteen Eighty-Four are the perfect fusion of botanicals and base spirit in bleak totalitarian terms then V for Vendetta is the tasteless engine lubricant that passes for gin, served in Victory Square. Ripped from the soiled pages of Alan Moore's 1989 Anti-Thatcherite fantasy, it envisions a Britain (though in the movie this is freely interchangeable with England betraying the ignorance of the screenwriters) that's been taken over by a tyrannical despotic government. All freedoms are curtailed, though sadly not the freedom to talk in long-winded sentences but we'll come back to that. 'V' is a terrorist who plans to change all this by dressing as Guy Fawkes, that other, er, champion of the oppressed masses, - hatching a plan to destroy Parliament, by now a symbol of repression and intolerance thus liberating the populous Â– Guido redux if you like while John Hurt, inverting his Winston Smith role, grimaces and gesticulates as the Stalinesque Chancellor who V plans to permanently deselect. I've not read the graphic novel and this is something I share with the filmmakers if the result is anything to go by. In fact so muddled are the politics, so flat the direction and so poor the performances that it feels from start to finish like the filmic equivalent of a dirty protest. Vendetta's conception is a washout in every respect. The poorly structured, badly written screenplay by the Warchowski Brothers is primarily to blame. Why are these people given so much latitude? Didn't anyone see the Matrix sequels? The brothers grim commit their own act of cine-terrorism by creating a sort of England USA where the English speak a sort of Californian-cockney. Listening to it recalls the scene from Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home is which Kirk suggests that they try to communicate with the space probe mimicking whale song. Spock points out that this would be pointless as you'd be copying the sounds not the language resulting in 'gibberish' Â– its as if all the dialogue in this film has been channelled through the same translation software. The brothers know some English colloquialisms but have no idea how they are naturally used in real speech. American audiences won't care of course but for the real English it will be an effort not to laugh your way through the whole thing Â– it'll be all you can do to stay awake. This is like grit in the eyes but sadly, it's not the worst of it. The dire-logue aside it's the total poverty of ideas that really gets to you as it drags on..and on. The government of the future has been so successful in crushing the will of the people that's it turned all Londoners into clichÃ©s who helpfully sit on their sofas and watch the telescreen all day, lapping up V's simplistic messages of dissent or alternatively they're the proles, drinking in dank pubs Â– looking downtrodden and fixated on drink. Yes indeed, this is very much British life as I'd imagine it to be were I from Illonois. The screenplay is incredibly wordy Â– very long speeches, exposition follows exposition. Those hoping for some action to liven up the proceedings or break up the dull patches will feel their heart sink into their stomach long before it crawls to its plodding climax. The worst points? There are so many but V's demented Dandy routine accounts for most Â– Natalie Portman sounds like a New Zealander who ever so often remembers to enunciate an English vowel (badly) Â– the scene in which she dresses as a school girl so tow curlingly embarrassing as to make her work on Star Wars look Oscar winning by comparison.Hugo Weaving is wasting his time as the man behind the mask as he could be played by anyone Â– in fact Eryol Flynn's corpse could have matched this level of performance and for Steven Fry, an intelligent man so we're told, this should be a deeply depressing episode. I'm sure the idea of playing a repressed gay man who appreciates classic literature but can't openly say so must have been a lure but my goodness, it's the febrile complex on the film's pallid, diseased face. In bonfire night terms, V for Vendetta is like a knocked off firework in an expensive looking box Â– once lit it doesn't go off for 2 hours and when you go to check it, the thing blows up in your face scarring you for life. One mark for the use of the Julie London song (very droll) and one mark for those dominoes but that aside this is a hideous waste of effort. The rack, noose and knife for all concerned please.",2,9,18,20 March 2006
