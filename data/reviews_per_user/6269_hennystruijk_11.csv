The Sound of Music," A Perfect Musical
","Cinematography, scenery, music, acting, story-how perfect can you get?? A film which is timeless!!",10,2,2,19 December 2018
To Be or Not to Be," A truly wonderful movie!
","From the screenplay to the performances to the direction--a perfect film that seems timeless. A young Robert Stack, the best Jack Benny on film, and sadly-the wonderful Carole Lombard in her last film. A gem from beginning to end!!",9,2,4,15 December 2018
Split," Not sure what to think!
","James McAvoy is amazing!! The rest of the cast wonderful..... But I have trouble with some of the logic in the film--like 3 girls couldn't overpower one man (even when he's a woman??). Everything takes place in a zoo?
No one notices anything unusual?
Still, there are scary parts very well done. And there are no graphic violent scenes--which is amazing in this day and age. So, all in all-it is worth seeing.",6,0,0,29 January 2019
Non-Stop," Quite silly!
","Despite a great cast, high techno effects, and some good moments--this film is so unbelievable it defies logic.... I really wanted to like it--but ultimately it was impossible.",6,1,2,11 February 2019
Get Out," A must see!!
","A very unique film. It's exciting, thought provoking, and scary! Certainly original.
Very well acted--deserves all the awards it won and was nominated for.",9,0,1,5 February 2019
Hidden Figures," A Great Inspiring Film
",The acting is amazing - - - besides the wonderful female leads--kevin costner does his best work in years--even kirsten dunst is good! Hard to believe this is what america was just 5 decades ago! It's come a long way--but not far enough!!!!,8,0,4,11 May 2019
It's a Wonderful Life," A film to cherish.
","Have seen this film many times--and never tire of it. But this is not a Christmas film!! Christmas is only in the last 20 minutes!!
It is a drama--often becoming like a long Twilight Zone episode. James Stewart gives
the best performance of his entire career.
The supporting cast is marvelous. This film never fails to move me deeply.",10,6,7,24 December 2018
Inception," I hate this film!
","Nothing but special effects, boring plot, and lame acting. I will never see this silly film again. Save time and money and watch
'Dark City' instead!!!",4,0,5,27 December 2018
Wonder Woman," Fun for teens and adults
",Gadot is wonderful - - Pine is eye candy.... Premise is silly--but yet it works!! Well made and entertaining. Slick and very visual. Doesn't feel like almost 2 1/2 hours at all.,7,1,6,15 April 2019
Green Book," A perfect film!
","Emotional, thought provoking, well acted, and should win best film of 2018 Oscar.
For young people-a little history lesson... Yet sadly, maybe it hasn't changed that much in the U.S.....the two leads are incredible--supporting cast brilliant. DO NOT MISS!!!",10,1,3,5 February 2019
From Here to Eternity," A true-and one of the very few- classic films.
","Where to begin? A true -and rare--classic.
Each of the 5 actors are brilliant--they all deserved oscars! Directing, writing, cinematography, supporting cast, etc. all amazing. A timeless film which will still hold up in 2041....",10,1,1,19 November 2019
