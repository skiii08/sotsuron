The Ring," Poor stuff
","Rainy Edinburgh afternoon. Free ticket. The cinema completely to myself.No crunching of popcorn or slurping of coke. After 20 minutes I started admiring the way the Emergency Exit signs were lit up but not too much. The problem - the dialogue. There was a decent movie in there somewhere but I sure couldn't find it. As with other critics I have questions:- How did Noah get to the island so quickly? and why was Noah such a bad actor? Why did the dad of the deceased teenager look like the dad of the deceased child in The Sixth Sense? Why did they have a funeral at, what appeared to be, night? Why, every time it rained, did I think of Se7en? Once again, what's with the horses? Am I right in thinking that the movie should've ended half an hour before it did? Was the reason it didn't have something to do with needing to set it up for Ring 2? I worry about these things",Null,0,1,5 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Repeat viewing rewarded
","On seeing the movie a second time I noted that it was still breathtaking but it was the sadness in Frodo that stood out. As in the book, Frodo feels himself doomed and the longer the journey goes on, the more this feeling grows. The other thing I noticed was the fine detail, all were wearing the brooches given to them by the elves(the fine detail of the book shouldn't be spelled out in the movie, Jackson has expected viewers to show some intelligence and use their imagination, or even read the book!).Interestingly, the movie I saw had an intermission (at weathertop). It is obvious(listen to the soundtrack) that there should have been an intermission just on completion of the fellowship at the council of Elrond. As with most other contributors I agree that this movie is up there with the best. There is also a side benefit. My three kids are reading the Lord of the Rings instead of playing PC games and watching TV. Roll on Part Two",Null,0,0,22 January 2002
