Hereditary," Definitely A Nightmare (and not in the way it should be)
","I'm not entirely sure where all these rave reviews I'm reading are coming from. What are people watching? This has to be one of the dullest, most tedious and disappointing movies I've seen for a long while. The trailer is definitely misleading, giving you false hope of a good old eerie, even psychological horror, not the bizarre freakshow it turns into. The first part of the movie moves at such a slow pace, it's hard to keep awake and when it does finally kick in it goes so far over the top it becomes embarrassing. Toni Collette, normally reliable, is so garishly OTT you have to watch her through your fingers, it's such a cringeworthy performance, and Gabriel Byrne is frankly wasted and he just looks like he wishes he hadn't signed up for it in the first place. I'm not sure how on earth this ridiculous piece of work is being compared to full on classics such as The Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby, there's just no comparison. The end of the movie couldn't come soon enough - an utter farce. Save your time and well earned money - I wish I had.",1,70,137,19 June 2018
