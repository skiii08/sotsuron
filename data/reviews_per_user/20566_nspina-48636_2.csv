Blade Runner 2049," How Sci-Fi Sequels Should Look
","This is one of the best Sci-Fi Films I've seen. Roger Deakins' cinematography was top-tier, definitely Oscar worthy. The colors were visually appealing and added to the mood of the story completely. Considering this is a sequel, it did not feel like a cash grab. The writers and director worked hard to add more to the dystopian world first seen in Philip K. Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' The story had a noir/western feel to it, in a good way. If I'm being honest, I would love to see another film in this universe. There is so much to be told regarding this version of our world.My only complaint is that Jared Leto's character was underdeveloped and had little screen time. I was expecting a big battle between Wallace and K/Deckard at the end. At the same time, it ends on a good note with K peacefully dying and Deckard meeting his daughter. There is definitely room for a sequel, regarding what Deckard does next or if there will be a war between the replicants and the government.Overall, this is a great sequel to a great film. If sequels are to be done for films, they should follow this film's footsteps: Only make it if there is more story to be added.",10,4,15,22 February 2020
Mystic River," Pretty good at first.
","The first act was very promising for this film. It is structured to seem as though Dave was the one who killed Katie, but it was too obvious to be him. As the film goes on, Jimmy figures it was Dave who killed, right as Sean finds out it was two kids who did it on accident. The fact that Jimmy doesn't show any remorse for killing Dave after realizing it wasn't him is what made this movie into not as good as it should've been.Sean Penn and Tim Robbins give great performances, certainly worthy of the Oscars they received. Although the writing could've been better. I feel that the last 20 minutes of the film dragged out and introduced the wives way too late. The backstory for these characters was obviously there, but it wasn't adequate to show their relationship thoroughly.As I said before, this film was great for the first two acts, as it was a nice mystery to follow, but the ending fell flat in comparison to the rest of the film. Above average film, but not good enough to be considered top tier. 7/10",7,1,2,8 February 2020
