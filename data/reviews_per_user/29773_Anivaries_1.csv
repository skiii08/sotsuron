Your Name.," Whatever you expect from this movie, it will be a thousand times better!
","First of all, i must say that anime and animation movies are not my cup of tea, but my gf loves them! So i watched quite a few with her. Now, take in consideration that my account is 8 years old and i never bothered to write a review on any movie.. BUT this movie surely deserves one!First things out, the movie opening with some beautiful animation and amazing soundtrack! 10 seconds in the movie, and im already 110% in it. Music is amazing throughout the movie and it massively adds on tension. I give music choice 10+ Animation is done surprisingly well. Dancing parts are top notch. Running, talking. Everything looks so smooth and amazingly done. Characters are quite believable and you'll love every single one of them. Even the side ones that show only for a few seconds. Their dialog is neat for as much as i could understand it. 10 for animation and characters. Now the story. It reminded me of Life Is Strange, which is probably my favorite game of all time ( even the music choice was similar ) because it has so much story and character involvement. And this movie succeeded in every aspect of character development, but i must say that story was redundant at some points. I dig sci-fi parts of it, but movie could've ended sooner than it was the run time and it would still be an amazing movie. It's like they needed some scenes just to fill the run time. NOW, don't get me wrong, story was excellent, it keeps you rooting for protagonist/s all the time. You'll feel sad at the time, you'll laugh, you'll be mad at some points.. there'll also be some ex-machina-ing. But overall, i give 9.5 for story. Overall 10/10. A movie you must watch if you haven't. It will make your day if not a week, and surely give you something to daydream about",10,2,3,6 March 2018
