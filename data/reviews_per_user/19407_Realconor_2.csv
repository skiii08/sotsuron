The Ring," Excellent!
","I love this movie.  Everything about it was brilliantly done.  The acting, cinementography, storyline, direction.  It's a beautiful film worthy of much more recognition than it gets.  I think this will become one of those movies that will stand the test of time and become a classic in the mystery, suspense and even horror genre.  I can't wait for the sequel. 10/10.",8,1,1,23 June 2003
28 Days Later...," How could you not enjoy it?
","I loved this movie. I thought it was brilliantly shot, acted and made. It's a throwback to classic zombie movies...but immensly updated and without the campiness of the aformentioned genre. Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris are brilliant together.  I highly recommend this to any movie goer out there. See it fast before it leaves theaters...you're going to want to see this one in the theater.8/10 Conor",8,0,1,14 August 2003
