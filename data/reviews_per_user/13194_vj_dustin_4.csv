Sucker Punch," You either love it or you hate it. It's guilty pleasure for me!
","Yeah, it's one of those movies which you're either like 'WTF am I watching?' or 'Wow, this is so bad ass.' For me it was the latter. The story is about this girl in an institution where she uses Dance as her survival. Her dance takes her into this weird but amazingly shown places where she basically fights off real problems shown as monsters & magic. The ending in my opinion was really unexpected and awesome! The cinematography is stunning and so are the soundtracks. The star cast, not famous, but gorgeous, does a pretty good job too specially the lead. If you're into details, the weapons, swords, statues, castles everything is right to a perfection. The only reason someone would hate this movie is if they try to watch it with logic. Keep an empty mind and let the movie flow! Just enjoy it without applying thoughts!",9,2,5,30 December 2013
Rush," The tag line is perfect - 'Everyone is driven by something'
","I frankly am a fan of racing sports (mostly car, not super bikes) so I had very high expectations from this movie already.First off the star cast is excellent and possibly the best suited ones. Chris Hemsworth - the flamboyant James Hunt. Perfect! Daniel Bruhl - the serious Nicki Lauda - Perfect as well!What I expected was that I'd love this movie for its amazing and intense Formula 1 racing scenes as seen in the trailer. And let me just say, they couldn't have been better. The direction is AMAZING. Focusing on those curves, gravel from the tires, head to head racing views, the audience enthusiasm, weather conditions, the pit crew, the celebrations, everything was spot on!But to my surprise that's not what I loved about the movie. What I absolutely loved was the portrayal of Hunt & Lauda by the actors. Their friendly rivalry, the passion, the courage, the decisions, the situation handling, the press conferences. But mostly the passion for the sport be it for different reasons. The ending was incredibly suitable and great too.I simply loved it. An undoubted 10/10",10,1,1,10 January 2014
Lucy," Staggeringly weird & awesome at the same time.
","I finally caught a show for Lucy.Huge Scarlett fan so I was sure there is no way this is gonna be a bummer!I had seen the trailer and I went in for a sort of Limitless, female edition!Now the movie starts awesome and the special effects are staggering, simply staggering!!But after the interval even though the effects are still on a high, the movie takes a 'VERY' different turn. I was in a state of shock, because I was loving what I was watching, but I had no idea what was happening. I actually knew what was happening, but I simply never saw it coming! The movie takes a steep turn into philosophy and life's meaning.Yeah think about that, you went in to see your hottie use her brain 100% to gain money and crap, and she is only after knowledge. I wasn't bummed, I was just surprised as to what was happening! XDThis might not seem like a very positive review, but I strongly urge you to see it on the big screen!Keep a broad broad mind though.",10,9,22,9 August 2014
The Hangover Part III," Worth the laugh! No idea why everyone is so Nancy about it!
","So first thing straight, this movie is the 3rd part of the Hangover series but unlike the first two, there is no Hangover and the a similar story line, where they try to remember what happened! Right here everyone looses their mind!But if you look at it closely, it's actually better this way! There is still the chemistry, specially with Chow, and throughout the movie you will laugh & smile! Also the ending was hilarious giving an open spot for a maybe Part 4! You should definitely watch it, if cynical, at least at home.9/10",8,3,4,21 September 2013
