"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," A great 'I laugh- I cry' movie!
","This a very good movie, entertaining, not necessarily what you would expect from a drag queen movie because of the sensitive description of the characters and the interesting Australian landscape. Flamboyant and touching!",8,3,5,2 September 1999
