","I didn't find this as elegant or refined as Miyazaki's best work, but I thought it was much more emotionally powerful. Seeing it with a good audience helps: I was moved when someone in the theater audibly gasped and involuntarily wailed 'No!' at one point in the movie. She spoke for all of us, because we were all bound up as one in that moment. That's a great movie.",10,9,14,9 April 2017
