Blade Runner 2049," A bit too tryhardy, but it works
","Starting with what bothered me. Pacing is slow, as expected, but it's a bit too much. As if they chose to force it, to be 'like the original'. The 'final' reveal is a bit forced too, with characters monologues being replayed in K's head (come on, we don't need to be reminded of what happened 15 minutes ago). The war set-up (3rd movie? please don't) was a bit lame too. But it was enjoyable nonetheless. The atmosphere still works. The pre-sex scene is very creepy, and plays well. Their best, deepest interaction was the last, The theme of letting go and what it means for a Replicant who still chooses to help others -even if he gets bamboozled by the script- went well. The genetically-weak daughter (supposed to be strong because of her superior parents) was a nice implicit message. Performances were good-tier and even Leto wasn't obnoxious.",7,0,4,9 October 2017
Darkest Hour," Pure performance
","Nothing new here. Only history. Even dialogues are -as expected- heavily inspired or taken from what was actually said.
But that's the point, and it's so well done. Oldman shows amazing acting (what a voice performance), the focus on the character (and the characters around him) is really well done, not too heavy handed but still poignant.TLDR : A biopic, but a great biopic.",8,1,5,20 January 2018
Deadpool 2," Meh. Forced and stale
","Had an ok time at the theater but nothing great actually stays in my mind the next day.DP2 is kind of everything you'd expect, the '4th wall breaking wow effect' gets old because it's not renewed in any shape of form : same joke about RR in GL, other actors in other movies, etc. 
Also, jokes about the first one and obscure references to make it sound like an intelligent satire.So yeah, I was kind of entertained but there's nothing more to the movie than some 'don't think too hard about it' action and puns.",5,0,3,4 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," How do you ruin dramatic tension?
","Yeah that's exactly how you do it. Man, what's happening? Where's the villain? We've been following Hulk and Thor for ages, why do we still need to hear the same lame puns, see the same overused visual 'gags'? It's not even slapstick comedy, it's stupid. The movie's not unwatchable, but why would you ruin everything you were trying to build with those -not so good- characters to begin with? Please leave this to Deadpool, even the stupid GoG2 proved you have to draw the line somewhere. Why is Loki such an inconsistent idiot? Why are we spoonfed everything? It even manages to assume the audience are a bunch of dumdums for example by using the same 'i forgot what my powers are, oh a convenient vision' twice, ruining the twist (or whatever it was supposed to be). Bonus points: if you've seen the trailers, don't bother watching the movie, you've already seen everything. For the post credit scene, it's on youtube.",5,13,35,26 October 2017
Baby Driver," Quite 'unoriginal' but well done
","Yeah of course the traditional 'one last job gone wrong' story is kind of overused but Baby Driver makes you care and is well directed. 
Characters are interesting, for what tey are, music is well paced and chosen, even the simili-twist works.",8,0,2,6 January 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Entertaining for a while, annoying overall
","It's a mediocre superhero movie, and definitely not a good movie.The action scenes are so busy and cut you're sick after 5 minutes. The images are fine but FX are too much. Sounds and effects are very loud and all over the place.
This is for the technical stuff.Thanos actually makes for a good villain, character-wise. I'd say it's the only character in this franchise with a bit of weight at this point, and that's nice. But his plan is dumb and even his Death-boner makes weirdly more sense, but oh well.Then, you realize Black Widow and other regular humans are as strong as Cap, Vision gets nerfed to hell, etc. At least they have the decency to leave Hawkeye retired. Might change thought, sadly.And man oh man the jokes. More jokes than in freaking Deadpool. It's supposed to be the end of the universe for Christ's sake. The additional 'meta-jokes' with Dinklage dealing with cringy GoT references are the worst. They're trying to add gravitas and sadness in the movie but you end up rooting for Thanos to end it once and for all.TL;DR : i was invited to watch the movie but if i could go back in time i'd have invested the money in a few beers. If you really have to watch it, watch it for Thanos' storyline.",6,2,4,7 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Made me reevaluate my opinions about TFA
","Man oh man. I really really disliked this movie.
I was so annoyed I reevaluated my feelings about TFA. What i thought was a 'first clumsy step' was actually the building blocks for a wrecking.The plot is stretched so hard you can see the holes. Wait who am i kidding, the holes are stretched so hard that they start creating their own plot.This movie's mainly about fan-service, but the kind that leaves you a bad taste in your sad mouth. Don't even get me started on Yoda's appearance, effects are terrible and it adds nothing. Yeah, the infamous 'homage'.The last Jedis' actions make no sense whatsoever, they end up butchering Luke's character that was built during the trilogy. Scrap the 'mature' and 'forgiving' Skywalker, you're now the dumb Anakin v2. Rey is kind of fine even if she has many useless scenes (ex the 'dark side cavern').
Also, why did they kill off the main villain that's shown to have tremendous power (yeah no explanation of this either) so easily? Was it to prove that 'arrogance makes you blind'? But he's clearly shown to win in a similar situation 2 minutes before...Not that it would have mattered if balanced and done correctly but you're always reminded that the oppressed/minorities are the good guys. And the classic rich people are also those who beat children and animals. The only character that comes to challenged this manichean organisation turns out to be a douche/villain and his point is automatically invalidated. And it gets really annoying really fast because it's forced like hell. Way to go, movie, that's an easy 99% on RT.Also it feels like there's absolutely no risk for the main characters. Only no-names die, or are harmed, the heroes don't bleed once. And then you have Leia who survives a huge blast (that killed everyone else in the room)+ 5 minutes floating in spaces but comes back a few hours later like nothing happened. 
Then you have the GoT-esque time paradoxes where nearly-destroyed spaceships that fly in circles manage to catch up with ok ships that fly in straight lines at full capacity. The good parts ? The acting is good for the most part. The new Force power that lets you communicate and project your feeling on long distances. Maybe the anime shot of Hodo's sacrifice, that took me out of the movie but looked at least different. TL;DR : 20% watchable, 10% enjoyable, 70% rehashed garbage that RT will praise",5,6,7,9 April 2018
Her," Very intense empathic reaction
","The strenght of this premice is that we've all experienced this kind of falling in love with someone/thing unreachable and in makes the struggles in Her very real. I felt a strong empathic reaction, one that i've felt rarely in movies, made possible by Poenix's very poignant acting.One of 2013's must see-s.",8,0,0,13 August 2018
