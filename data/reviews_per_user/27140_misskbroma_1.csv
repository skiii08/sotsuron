Black Swan," A New York City ballerina strives for perfection in performing the lead role in Swan Lake and learns that achieving perfection isn't always done PERFECTLY.
","Very good movie. I went to go watch it with my mom and we really enjoyed it. I would say that this movie is a Dark Drama/Thriller, because there were moments that made me cringe and freaked me out. The storyline and acting was great. This movie has to take an award. I don't think, however, this movie is for everyone. A lot of people at the theater box were surprisingly young and walked out saying things like, 'What the hell was that?' The movie is very serious, so if you're looking for a chick flick or a comedy, don't bother. One needs to appreciate and understand the beauty behind the story being told in the movie. Even though I myself am young, I don't think that other people my age could really handle it. You have to be open minded and expect the unexpected: the twists in a movie that at first make you say 'huh?' and 'what?' and at the end 'Ohhhhh!!!!!!!!!!' or 'Wow!!!' Because this movie is so dark and depressing, I probably can't watch it more than one or two times. Nonetheless, it's excellent and deserves to win at least a few Oscars! This is the story of how wanting to be the best could actually bring out the worst. But can it be that one who brings out the worst can actually end up being the best?",8,0,3,21 January 2011
