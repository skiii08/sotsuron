The Rock," Powerful
","Convincing characters, explosive action, amazing quotes - even the scenery is a joy to behold. This movie ran me through the gauntlet of emotions. Edge of the seat excitement during the car chase and the climactic shoot-out; laughter when watching Connery and Cage argue back and forth ('Your best? Losers always whine about their best. Winners go home and f#*^ the prom queen!'). What surprised me the most about it though was the movie's ability to make me feel sympathy and affection for the characters. Ed Harris conveys the deep agony of General Hummel's ambiguous actions brilliantly and watching Sean Connery and Clare Forlani as father and daughter together was one of the most touching sequences I had seen in years. One of my top 5 movies ever!",10,3,4,22 June 2007
