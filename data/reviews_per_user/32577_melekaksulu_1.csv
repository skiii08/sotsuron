Skyfall," disappointment
","Very poor film according to the previous James Bond I saw... 'Casino Royale' and 'Quantum of Solace' were very different and special, not the usual stereotypically style; so that 'Daniel Craig' became my favorite James Bond artist. But Skyfall disappointed me. I thought that James Bond movie would have progressed and free itself from the typical style... But it was this time as usual: the action parts too long and boring. The part how James Bond rescued after falling deep into the water is missing. It could be important to give the audience a view to the feelings of James Bond. But:the landscape scenes were beautiful and interesting... and I liked the song from Adele.",3,24,57,7 November 2012
