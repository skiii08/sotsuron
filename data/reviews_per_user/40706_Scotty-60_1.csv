Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Definitely a 'Prequel'
","This film was pretty good, although not quite up to 'Star Wars' standards. The film is certainly a 'prequel,' and you'll need all of your fingers and toes to count the loose ends which will be tied up in later episodes.  The best part about the movie:  the light saber fights were as well choreographed as anything Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have done.  The worst part:  the computer-generated effects (although very good) are still not quite realistic, and at times give the impression that the movie is a big cartoon.",6,0,1,27 May 1999
