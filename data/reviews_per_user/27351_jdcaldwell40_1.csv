Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Bad movie
","I have to admit, the movie started out to be possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen. Borat in his home country for the first 10 minutes were priceless. However, the movie traveled down a dark path and became nothing but perverted antics. The accent got old, and the perversion was boring. Not recommended for viewers looking for a movie with an actual plot and original scenes. If the movie had more of a political and social influx of ideas, then it would have been much more appealing to me. I give Cohen a nod for trying as hard as he did, but many more ideas could have been implemented. I know this movie is going to be popular with a lot of people, but I was not impressed.",3,9,18,5 November 2006
