The Monuments Men," A lack of everything..
","Uneven, unfunny, plainly dull, poorly acted, lacking any recognisable narrative structure, completely devoid of discernible artistic/directorial style and just a big waste of everyone's time.Oh the irony that the film tells the story of saving works of art! but I'd suggest they'd have needed an act of god to save this piece of rubbish.There was nothing at all to redeem this nonsensical flick and I'm sure GP's would soon be prescribing as a cure for insomnia if the effects weren't so severe as to actually risk educing a coma.Give it a wide-birth or give it a watch the night before something important, you'll thank yourself.",4,4,6,18 February 2014
Rush," Superb
","I rarely eulogise about big â€“budget cinema nor do I exalt the virtues hyped-up films with big marketing budgets, I find them all too often under-cooked. Rush is certainly the exception to the rule.The characters are fully formed, the plot is purposefully driven and the script is nicely punctuated with recurring humour and clearly developed acts that move the story forwards while retaining a sense of it's self.If you don't know the story already, then you're in for a treat. If you do; then you've the opportunity to get the full visceral fly-on-the-wall experience of what was happening behind-the-scenes (artistic licence seems to be within a fair margin of error).Ron Howard seems to flit between the sublime and the ridiculous, with Rush most definitely being the former rather than the latter.The casting of Hemmsworth as Hunt was always going to cause ructions, but to my taste he manages to effortlessly embody everything about the racing 'superstar'; from the 70s swagger to the clipped speech pattern Hemmsworth delivers a memorable and driven performance.The real star of the show however is neither Howard or Hemmsworth, but the excellent Daniel Bruhl as Austrian racing legend Nikki Lauder. Having been an admirer of talents for a while, it was only a matter of time before the promise shown in Goodbye Lenin, the Edukators, Inglorious B's etc led to leading roles in major international productions. His performance in Rush is as measured as it is passionate and (admittedly helped by the story) it's Bruhl who comes out with the most credit.With an admirable lack of profanity Ron Howard and counter-parts have skilfully delivered the best racing movie in many a long year.Rush is a film made with enough craft to draw you in and entertain you, and far more than enough guile to keep you intrigued long after the credits have rolled.",10,2,3,27 September 2013
Man of Steel," So close but yet so far
","Superman seems to be a character that has always split opinion, so to have an equally polarising director like Zack Snyder directing the film was always going to be a recipe for intrigue and interest.I've read a lot of reviews on here where people scream superlatives about the delineated narrative structure or use sentences like 'finally a Superman film to be proud of' (yada yada yada)...The truth is that these statements are undeniably true and yet also irrevocably false. Tough to figure? I agree.Essentially while there is a lot to like about the story, the direction, Henry Cavill, Kevin Costner et al, there is still a lot missing, Too many scenes that are never established, too many careless shots inserted haphazardly amongst the beauty the adorns the rest of the piece, too many jerky and off-kilter lines in the script that take you out of yourself and make you realise that you're just watching a movie and nothing more.I still hold BATMAN BEGINS up as the greatest super-hero film to date, but MAN OF STEEL felt like the best bits of WATCHMEN, mixed with the worst bits of DARK KNIGHT RISES.Overall, it's not a convincing narrative, nor a very carefully constructed movie and yet, it does have some rough edged beauty to it.So much to like, yet so much room for improvement.",5,2,4,18 June 2013
Avatar," Avatar: The Matrix meets Braveheart set in Fern Gully; with traces of the Phantom Menace.
","A couple of years ago I found myself wondering what had ever happened to that once great director James Cameron? You know the one; he produced a string of hits, Titanic, T2, True Lies, Aliens. He had managed to circumvent the artistic divide somewhere between critical acclaim and box office success. Whatever happened to him?Basically, Avatar happened. It was an acorn of an idea that; like anything worth investing time in, has taken many many years to bring from infancy to adulthood. A real labour of love that has made a lot of recent waves in the media for setting new records for budget requirement and length of post production. All of this coupled with the kudos that goes with a James Cameron project, mean that the goalposts for success both critically and financially, were going to be set pretty high....As a film Avatar works fairly well, it sets it's building blocks on very firmly established sci-fi ideals and ensures at all times that no matter how imaginative the storytelling; the realm of reality that has been crafted is consistent and believable.There are a lot of nuances that would have you believe Avatar has scrounged strong plot moves and ideals from several other films and on the whole this has to be accepted. Avatar cannot be considered a wholly original or innovative sci-fi movie. In my mind I can set aside some of this 'borrowing' by clinging on to the fact that the first draft was apparently written a long time before some of its predecessors were ever conceived. This however does not excuse any of the stylistic elements which make Avatar look very much like an homage to The Matrix, The Phantom Menace and the Halo franchise.There is an amalgamated feel to Avatar which is all its own and if you can forget that you are seeing a fairly straight forward, unidirectional story unfold before your eyes; then I think there really is something in there for everyone. From pretty much the first scene it was fairly obvious what was going to happen to Jake Sully and how the character would develop within the realms of the story. However the was still enough drama, action, romance and political overture to keep me enthralled for the majority of the movie.there is a 30 minute segment in the middle of the picture which judged against the rest, could be considered a little dull. However even this section could never be considered lifeless or without heart, nor would make anyone turn the movie off or leave their seats. In truth this part of the narrative is almost unavoidable and within the realms of the characters provided is absolutely inevitable. There is a certain school of thought, that would lead me to believe this part of the story is deliberately slow burning to allow the magnanimous crescendo at the finale to be accentuated, however I have to temper that opinion by saying that it still won't be to everyone's liking.There is a message in Avatar that is obvious and makes no excuses for its self and to a large extent; no excuse is needed. The overtures it makes have been made for as long as mankind has been in existence and there are very few people in the world who would be blind the problems it attempts to highlight.The acting throughout the film is universally excellent. It is now obvious why Sam Worthington is such high demand after only a very short carrier thus far. Sigourney Weaver reignites her relationship with James Cameron demonstrating the vigour that came before. She acts as a good foil for Worthington throughout. The undoubted star of the show however, isn't actually an actor or actress but the CGI created 'Nytiri' voiced excellently by the increasingly impressive (and busy) Zoe Saldana. The effects department have obviously taken extreme care to ensure the complex delicacy of the character is obviously but subtly presented on screen (it's a real triumph).Whilst the story isn't pulling up any trees (sorry that's a pun) or filled to the brim with new ideas, the CGI team have mastered the images presented absolutely faultlessly. It really could be considered an evolutionary step forward in digital media and green screening. Through 120+ minutes of entertainment their expertise can never be questioned.So whilst there are overly corny moments that will have some audiences rolling their eyes and there are periods of sentiment and political overture that are laid on a little thick; these slight errors in judgement can be forgiven because the overall attainment level of the film far outweighs the slight glitches.A masterpiece of storytelling? No. But a memorable, enjoyable, inoffensive and likable motion picture? Yes, most certainly.",7,15,31,17 December 2009
The Dark Knight Rises," Ugh!
","The Dark Knight Rises is a mishmash of at least three different Batman Comic story-arc's combined haphazardly into an incoherent mess. The whole thing reeked of poor storytelling, an unclear vision, an overly bloated story and having to apiece raft of characters. The photographic direction is interesting in places but all together doesn't have asense of its self or any consistency. Nolan also gives the audience almost no credit to figure out anything for themselves, feeling the need to film an explanation for every question that is posed and thus very much dumbing the movie down. It's not the worst movie ever, it has plenty of redeeming features. It just certainly doesn't even come close to matching the heights of Inception, Memento, The Prestige or Batman Begins.",6,1,12,26 July 2012
