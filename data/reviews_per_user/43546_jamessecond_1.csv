Your Name.," Absolute masterpiece
","I rarely give movies or series 10 stars,
but some movies deserved it.Kimi no na wa. was some of the best movies I've ever seen and the best anime movie I've ever seen.
Everything in this movie matches: The characters, the plot, the music, the dialogues, etc.If you really want to see a movie that touches your heart, whatch this. To be worth your time are no words for it.",10,0,0,4 April 2020
