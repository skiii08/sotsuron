The Blair Witch Project," Big hype...No payoff!
","Yes, I know the popular thing to say is 'it leaves so much to the imagination'.  The problem is it leaves EVERYTHING to the imagination.  So much so that you could stay at home, the $7 and imagine the whole movie...you would be just as well off.  Big, big hype....No payoff. Curiously non-atmospheric, the movie just sort of sits there.   I can understand why it has made so much money, but why it is in the top 250 on imdb.com?",5,0,2,14 August 1999
