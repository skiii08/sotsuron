First Man," One time watch
",I felt the narration is little confusing but the climax was emotional I just learnt in my childhood about Neil Armstrong that he was the first person to step on the moon but after watching this film I learnt many things about his life especially love for his family,9,0,0,20 July 2019
A Star Is Born," Just okay
",It was so painful for me to watch Bradley cooper as an alcoholic I always loved to watch him in movies with cool personality like hangover but he is so sick in this movie with weird tone Lady Gaga is the show stealer and just amused with her tone overall it's worth watching movie,8,0,0,25 July 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Awful
","The characters in this movie are so childish especially hulk
all the characters are making joke about themselves especially Thor I wonder how many times he repeated the dialogue that he is the god of thunder
Hela has the power to break Thor's hammer but at the end got defeated by sutur how silly it is
Valkyrie role is disgusting there is too much overacting in her role
Finally this is children movie with too many flaws hardly one time watch,bad script,vfx good that's it",7,2,3,23 July 2019
X-Men: The Last Stand," Stupidity
",I wonder why magneto needs an army of mutants to destroy the CURE maybe he could just destroy the place where the CURE is invented and supplied with the help of jean....her powers are not used perfectly at all she destroys the CURE only at the climax where the soldiers tries to shoot her but there's no use all the mutants army was destroyed by the time.....if the mutants really want a place to live in comfortably without humans involvement they could have created their own place to live that's it,7,1,1,26 July 2019
Black Panther," Overrated and confusing
",I heard so many good reviews from critics and this movie was nominated for oscars too in so many sections so I thought to watch but....... the movie is dragged too much the plot is so simple and I have watched many movies with same story line vfx is the only thing that made me engaging for so much time only few scenes are likable fight scenes are not that good that's it,7,0,2,21 July 2019
Incredibles 2," Predictable
",Except the twist at preclimax I felt the film was not as good as the first part I hope there is a third part too and have a better script,8,2,3,20 July 2019
