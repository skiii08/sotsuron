The Avengers," The Mark of A New Generation of 'Good Films'
","The Avengers falls nowhere short of delivering a fiery and action packed roller coaster ride of explosions. The movie spends its time passing on the spotlight to each avenger, showing off his or her unique ways of dominating enemies and overcoming hazardous obstacles. Seeing all of our favorite superheroes unite under one common enemy is an exciting thought and was inevitable from one day working its way into a movie. Having an army of superheroes to save the world from utter destruction isn't always a bad thing, but for a film, sometimes less is more. While The Avengers offers many good fighting scenes, special effects, and cool futuristic gadgets that make your head spin, the fundamentals of a good film are simply lacking. The main problem with this movie is it's plethoric cast of superheroes. There are way too many to center on at once. As hinted earlier, the movie focuses too much on showing off each character one at a time, constantly switching the audience's support from one to another. Throughout the movie, there is a constant struggle for dominance between each avenger that involves boasting, smack talk, bouts, and interferences. Pretty soon the audience is divided up rooting for their favorite hero, and the whole idea of the main villain is dropped completely! The story is simple and clear: kill Loki. Scene after scene however, that mission is forgotten by two or more of the avengers trying to display their macho-ness to one another. Unlike many great movies, this plot line is drastically linear and bare to the bones in meaning. In the midst of the film, I thought I was watching an intense WWA match from the future. Six superheroes is just too many for one movie. The filmmakers did a good job focusing on each hero, but that is all they had time for. I can't help but think, if they only had two, maybe three main heroes, they would have had enough time to develop a more interesting and meaningful plot. Decades ago, we saw for the first time great and innovative movies like Star Wars, Terminator 1 and 2, Platoon, Alien, and (just last decade) The Dark Knight. All of these films were able to focus on several main characters, villains, and a storyline that were all intricately tied together and saturated with meaningful and thought-provoking ideas. In light of The Avengers' wide and warmly welcomed reception, it seems that the standards and expectations for 'good films' has switched to a more dry and corny interpretation. All The Avengers truly has to offer is wild action scenes, interpersonal conflict, and imaginative applications of special effects. These assets however are known for never having the capability of elongating a films success and keeping it in the fond memories of its viewers. Movies like Star Wars, which originated in the 70's, lacked horribly in intense action, and animation, but the qualities of a good story and its creativity keeps it so popular to this day. Other examples of movies that only glimmered for their achievements in animation are ones like Avatar, which was quickly forgotten because it lacked a fundamentally solid story to remember. The Avengers is merely eye-candy that satisfies Marvel fans and audiences seeking captivating fight scenes. It is more appropriate to label this work a collection battle animated scenes rather than an actual movie.",6,2,5,10 December 2013
Inglourious Basterds," What did I just watch?
","This movie makes a complete joke out of the second world war as Tarantino insults all of those involved in or affected by it. The witty acting and historical inaccuracy serve as a mockery to this important piece of history. On another note, it creates major stigma towards German soldiers and civilians during the war, as the main characters express their hatred through mass killings and unjust punishment. Of course Hitler was an evil man, but the movie forgets about the internal conflicts within Germany, labeling every Nazi soldier as an evil devil-like animal. The film also puts too much sympathy on the Jews. Obviously what the Germans in the war did was wrong, but Tarantino has the Jews do the same things back to German prisoners of war in the film to send the message that it is okay for Jews to unleash this exact form of anger previously seen in Nazis. This over exemplified sympathy and endorsement of Jews really gives this film a questionable meaning and is certainly not healthy in light of religious and cultural conflict as seen in other parts of the world such as the Middle East.",1,1,6,15 April 2013
The Hunger Games," Weak Storyline and Horribly Unbelievable
","This is definitely one of the worst and most ridiculous stories I have ever seen in a movie. Apparently the acting government demands a boy and girl between the ages of 12-18 from every district to duke it out with each other until the death. Oddly enough however, these are no ordinary 12-18 year old. As you will see, if you poorly choose to see this ludicrous excuse for a film, these kids are black hearted and bloodthirsty killers who each acquire years of training in weapons handling, stealth, and martial arts. These personae are completely inconsistent with the reluctant and frightened children who were lined up in rows upon the names selection for each contestant. Another thing that bothered me was the rebellion that took place after the black girl died. What did they expect? Why rebel then? Did they really think she would have made it out alive given that she is just one of some 26 contestants? The idea for the movie is okay, but the delivery is simply a mess. Going into the film, I expected myself to sympathize with all of the kids since their totalitarian government is forcing them to slit each other's throat. It seems however that the majority of them like doing it, and are happy to be there. I kept asking myself throughout the movie, 'What in the world am I watching!?' Very little of the characters are likable, which isn't always a bad thing, but in this case it is. The storyline would have had much more going for it if it had the audience holding feelings for the young kids, but instead, it seems like they just want the view to sit back, relax, and enjoy the onslaught as if it is a gladiator game in a coliseum. The movie has some plus's worth mentioning. Obviously it does have a good cast of actors. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson both add a lot of energy to their characters. The filming and cinematography are worth noting as well. The movie might pass as something to watch with a group of friends on a Friday night, but I have no other regards for the film. If you are looking for an interesting and exciting piece of work, you will not find it here. You can find more enjoying watching something happen under a rock.",3,5,7,8 December 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A Great Archetype of The Hollywood Business
","After a massive let down from watching the first movie, I was surprisingly curious enough to wonder where the story would go in the second. My main issue in the first film was a lack of a compelling and believable story, but I walked in the theater to see this one anyway, hoping the film makers sought redemption for what was so abysmal. It didn't surprise me much however to find that story was once again dry, rigid, and crusted over with garbage, just like a dog turd on a summer sidewalk.The story continues directly from the events following the victory of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark in the hunger games. President Snow crafts the two characters towards into public figures, forcing them to positively represent the government to gain more popularity for the hunger games. The movie actually starts out quite promising as we see a great deal of tension growing between the districts and the state. We see the very beginning of martial law come into effect, rebels planning to coalesce, and fear permeating through the characters. It looks very good, until Hollywood decides drop by the scriptwriters' office with another visit. This movie's only purpose is to give you hope of something good and then crush by sending you back to the train wreck of a film we experienced in the first movie. By this point, if you haven't done so already, get ready to kick back and watch the nonsensical onslaught continue. That's right, you're in for another hunger game!About less than halfway into the movie, the viewer is virtually left watching the first movie all over again. The director should have saved time filming and simply cut and paste the first movie in at this point. While the characters are busy killing each other for the second time, it is hard not to hope that we will get some more information about what is happening on the home front. What is the government doing? How are the districts reacting? How are the families of the main characters in district 12? Rather than our questions getting answered, all we get are some more scenes of Katniss and her bow, Peeta falling in love with her for the second time, and poorly developed characters (who we are supposed to feel sorry for) die. Also, similarly to the first movie, we see more attempts of intimidation among the players, chances to win sponsorships, lots of prep talk before the big fight, and a shot of all of the contestants broadcasted in their kooky outfits before they get shipped off to the slaughter house.There are a few things I should probably mention before some fans of the movie do. Not that it matters, but the hunger game in this movie is slightly different from that of the first. In response to the uproars in the districts, the government expresses their displeasure by sending previous victors from each district back into the hunger games. This really makes no difference for the viewer, since we see over 20 new bloodthirsty contestants besides Katniss and Peeta anyway. A few other trivial differences include the new arena the game takes place in. This time, the characters start the fight in the water rather than on land. Also, the whole arena is apparently bigger (even though it just looks like another forest), and there are environmental hazards that occur on an hourly schedule. It really doesn't matter, and it is painful to think that the filmmakers think they can win their audience over with such a frivolous change. In my opinion, the only thing that this franchise really has that wins its popularity is their main cast, Jennifer Lawrence. But that doesn't fix the story. The essence of the film is still fundamentally flawed. It is no different than trying to treat the scent of a puddle of diarrhea with fabreeze air freshener!At one point in the movie, Katniss and her friends contrive a plot to eliminate the remaining contestants. Out of nowhere, in the middle of the plan's execution, she somehow figures out how to escape the arena, and the entire infrastructure collapses. Suddenly Katniss is rescued by a ship, as if the whole plan to escape was coordinated from the beginning, and she requests to return to her home. She and the audience learn that district 12 has been destroyed. The movie ends. A long silence follows until the credits roll along with an animation of the mocking jay pin. Not only is this one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings to a film in the history of films, but the director adds insult to injury as he essentially tells us, 'Too bad, you missed out on all of the important stuff that happened in the real world, and instead, you got to watch the first movie over again!' Not only do we get a repeat of what already happened, but we are left in complete darkness and miss out of every single detail that could have potentially progressed the storyline. The movie could have literally been cut in half if the whole hunger game was removed, and we still would have gotten the same amount of essence from the story. This movie is a prime example of how Hollywood takes something with a lot of potential and strips it of all nutrients until it becomes as bare as a pile of elephant dung. The film is nothing more than a monotonous moneymaking expedient that deserves to be flushed down the toilet! The only reason why I regard it slightly higher than the first is for the first few scenes of the movie that actually grabbed my attention. In retrospect, that momentary grasp of interest wasn't worth the other two hours of an appalling scam.",4,41,80,8 December 2013
