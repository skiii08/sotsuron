It," Great movie - but not as scary as one could hope IT to be
","The new adaptation of 'IT' is good.Do I think it's better than the mini series from 1990... well I do and it is better in many ways, but to be honest, I was more afraid of the older version of Pennywise. Maybe it's just me who's now older and not as easy to scare as when I was a kid, but before I went to see the new adaptation in the cinema, I saw the 1990 mini series, and that version still gave me a creepy feeling.I had really high hopes for the new version, and many of my expectations were meet, but I wasn't scared or had any real moments, where my heart beat faster or so.For me, there were just something missing, like more violent scenes or scenes where kids were taken by Pennywise, instead of just hearing about missing kids. The opening scene with Georgie... well... let me say, it was good, but not scary good. They could have shown Pennywise eat his arm or something, where they really went over the line and made Georgie suffer. Because it sounded like he was laughing when Pennywise took his arm and drag him into the sewers.And that was just one of the things I think was wrong or missing in the movie. It just wasn't scary, creepy or anything as I had high hopes for IT to be.It's not Bill Skarsgård's fault, cause he did a great job, but at no point in this movie, did I find Pennywise really scary. Andy Muschietti have made a very good adaptation, but IT could have been much better, if they had just made it scary and more violent, by showing Pennywise eat a kid or two or three, instead of just telling about it.",8,3,44,7 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Worst of the nine
","Star Wars IX: The Rise of Skywalker or The fall of the franchise.What a bad movie. Full of cliches, bad writing, really bad CGI that made Legolas jump in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies look amazing, then you know it's a bad movie.And when you miss Jar Jar Binks, then you know how bad it is. They not only ruined the franchise with this piece of sh**, they also destroyed it totally.Compared to the Avengers: Endgame movie, that had a fitting end to 23 movies, JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson's last three Star Wars movies just concluded with a big turdðŸ’©By the way... the LGBT movement just made its debut into the Star Wars Universe. In the upcoming Star Wars trilogy, we probably are going to see droids join the MeToo movement.Anyways... Star Wars IX: The Rise of Skywalker I give you 2 out of 10 Stars.ðŸ˜«
1 for the ending and the 2nd for reminding me to never watch anything with JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson ever again.",2,25,45,19 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Infinity war is head and shoulders above Endgame
","Endgame is a good movie, but not a great one.Is it a fitting end for the 20+ movies, hell yes, but still it´s falls short in way too many areas.The plot is what all thought it would be about, with some small twists, but the first 1,5 maybe 2 hours could have been much shorter.When things start to pick up, and we get the epic show down... well... It´s one big LET DOWN :(Again it´s a good movie, but great.... no way.
It´s really a disappointing ending to so many great Marvel movies, as the big battle is over and done before it even starts.Maybe I had too high expectations, and many will disagree, but damn im bummed out about the ending.",7,555,1221,24 April 2019
1917," Great cinematography ... but way to borring
","What a beautiful made movie... just wished they had put more effort into the story.20 min of excitement, but then it slows down the rest of the movie, and it's just a poor and lazy writing job.I will give them credit for the way it was filmed, that's an Oscar worthy.But no wear near the league of film like; Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, The Thin Red Line, Stalingrad or one random episode of Band of Brothers.Again, the script is way to poorly written, to even come close to War movies like those above.",7,3,7,22 January 2020
