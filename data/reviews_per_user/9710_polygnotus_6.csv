The Equalizer," I Can't Trust a Denzel Washington Movie Anymore
","Sad. This was barely a notch above a Steven Seagal movie. But worse, it had Denzel Washington in it. That hurt me.The movie was as clich√©' and stupid as most action movies. This one seemed slightly unique in its bland of the revenge porn template with a slasher gore thing. Only the slasher was the protagonist.Seeing Washington put a screwdriver into the back of someone's skull, then pull the trigger, was truly the low point of his career. But it was also another low point in mainstream American film.The moral inversion is almost complete. We have serial killers as heroes. Why not a madman with power tools.This kind of violence is supposed to be funny. The chainsaw massacre, so over the top, you laugh out loud. But what Antoine Fuqua has done with this movie is attached psychopathic bloodletting with the cause of justice. And this isn't just bloodletting. Mel Gibson perfected that years ago.This is psychopathic bloodletting. By another American psychopathic hero.",2,63,136,25 September 2014
Terminator Salvation," Movie? What movie?
","The reason the original Terminator was such an enduring success is because it had intrigue. Time travel is always intriguing and T1 had a new, albeit implausible take on it. And the fish out of water element of putting a typical suburban housewife in the middle of a struggle for the future of humanity was intriguing too.The fun of all this intrigue was that when the scary machine man from the future chased the kid and his mom all over LA, we were engaged. We cared. And because we cared, when the abundance of action did occur, it had a sense of purpose we could latch on to, a reason to take the ride.The problem with this movie, as with most of the post-Bruckheimer action films, is it has no intrigue, no character, no heart, and no sense of purpose. How one could produce a film about an apocalyptic future Earth devoid of intrigue is the most intriguing thing to me.So, like so many others in the genre, I've already forgotten about this film only minutes of having left the theater.What did I just see again? Speed, explosions, effects, and the attempted piggybacking on the intrigue created by James Cameron and a lost, forgotten Hollywood that once understood the importance of telling a story. What I saw was just another forgettable movie where plot came a distant second to action and effects. It is, of course, amazing what can be done nowadays. And T4 is a visual masterpiece of CGI and effects. But what a waste. Because without heart, intrigue, and purpose, there's really not much of a purpose in seeing this film. Demolition derbies are more fun.",4,3,6,25 May 2009
Shutter Island," This Movie is a Horrible Experience
","...made more so by Scorsese's mastery.It's as though Michaelangelo mustered all of his talents to paint the mangled bodies of dead children.Despite superb acting and direction, and a masterful score, the movie didn't actually work on me. I became removed by a faltering second act, a second dream sequence that detached the story from itself, and a disappointing degree of predictability. But as a parent, I'm glad I was de-immersed. It largely inoculated me from the dreadfulness that would follow.But the rest of the audience was, apparently, not so lucky. As I left the theater what I saw were psychologically traumatized people as a morose darkness had descended upon their Friday night.If your idea of a good evening out is to be severely psychologically disturbed, this is a movie for you. Dead ringer anyone? Which begs the question: Why? Why bother making this turd of a movie. Because you can? F you Mr Scorsese. The world's ugly enough without your vision.",1,30,67,19 February 2010
Interstellar," I'm Sorry, But This Was just a Horrible Story
","Just horrible. An audience can endure a lot of hardship if there's a seed of hope. And that's really this movie's downfall. It's hopeless. Then it gets even more hopeless. And just when you couldn't think it could be any more hopeless, it gets worse - five more times.It's one thing to create conflict for your characters. But this movie is the equivalent of making a movie about a baseball team, and they lose, fail, die off, lose some more, fail some more, continue losing, and then finally, at the end, for reasons unfathomable, they suddenly win.The bottom line is it was just a downer. A long, tedious, depressing downer. For three hours. And then, in the last 10 minutes of the film, everything's all suddenly better.All of that talent, amazing production, amazing performance, just to tell this horrible, depressing story.As always, I study the faces of people in the theaters, and on the way. There's wasn't a 9 out of 10 face in sight. Everyone I saw looked as tired and fatigued as I must have.And yet we have a IMDb rating of 9.1? Sorry. I don't buy it.",3,8,16,8 November 2014
Lincoln," Can Color Please Come Back In Style?
","There is a lot to love in this movie. The acting, the score, the script - all pretty much flawless. But I walked out thinking this was another Spielberg film ruined by the cinematography of Janusz Kaminski.I know that Kaminski is brilliant. And I know that some of his work has created real beauty on the big screen. But this was not beautiful. It was harsh, bleak, desaturated ugliness. And worse, it looks like a dozen or more Photoshop effects.What's worse, because of Spielberg's stature, the Kaminski 'style' has caught on so we've been seeing other decent movies ruined by this effect too over the years. Please. Enough. This is a trend that's run its course. Like pre-damaged jeans. It is not classic looking. It is not authentic. It's just ugly.",4,2,4,30 December 2012
Elysium," Don't Listen to the Angry Republicans
","This movie was a blast. I went with five people, and every single one loved it. So did most of the audience judging by their mood and comments exiting the theater.The only people who don't like this film are right wing crazies who don't like anything that might draw attention to thew perverse wealth disparity between a few thousand super rich people and everyone else.While I don't consider this to be a political film, it does depict a projection of our current situation where one small elite class lives in a completely different world then the rest of us. If that bothers you, then please, don't see this film.But if you like solid entertainment, an excellent and moving story, and amazing special effects and visuals, you can't do better.",4,8,24,9 August 2013
