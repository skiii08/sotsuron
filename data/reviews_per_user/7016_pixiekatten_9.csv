Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049; a highly disappointing and unnecessary sequel.
","It hurts to write this review. It really does. Because this was one of the 2017 movie releases that had me filled with most anticipation and excitement. I could not wait to see it as I had spent many hours in the 80s and 90s re-watching the original Blade Runner with my older sibling. I could not wait to see the dark post-apocalyptic, and very magical poetry, from the predecessor being revived and brought to life yet again. But wow, what a let down. I see the 10/10 reviews on IMDb and all I can think is 'did these people really watch the same film' ... 'are they mistakenly reviewing the 80s film'??? Because Blade Runner 2049 is not worth 10 out of 10. It is so far from perfection, it is to be honest, a completely unnecessary sequel that I could have been without.I don't like to give away plots because in case you haven't seen the BR 2049 it might spoil what little intrigue this movie managed to whisk up. So I won't mention the first (and one of the few) 'hey, I didn't see that coming!' moments (which unfortunately comes along about 5minutes into the film and then it drags until the next). As the plot SLOWLY (oh so slowly) unfolds we are supposed to be wowed I guess. Gosling does his blade runner thing and stumbles upon a box, buried with some deep secrets. He then drives around (a lot) looking for clues and trying to crack this case. And the plot deepens, supposedly. So Gosling drives around some more. Talking (a lot of talking) to a few characters, many of them with such stilted acting that it leaves much to wish for. Seriously waiting for something to actually happen now! The original Blade Runner might not be classed as an action movie but there are a few very memorable fight scenes that has stuck with me for 30 years... Daryl Hannah posing as a doll for example - masterpiece and classic scene! We get none of that in the sequel. Instead we get Jared Leto rambling and babbling and making me completely losing the thread, and the interest. By now I am looking at my watch wondering how long there might be left of the movie. And this is only halfway in. Snooze. Turning to my fellow cinema goer, and whoops there you go, he is actually asleep in his seat. Not the work of a 10/10 movie I'll tell you that!So on it goes. More driving. More talking. More clues. We get a few explosions and minor twists and turns. The only saving grace of the movie is the soundtrack. It is messing with your head all on its own, going from tranquil to a kick in the gut in seconds. Loved it. The scenery is alright. But if you have seen the original film then this one doesn't really add anything new. There is none of the wow factors from seeing the dark and the grit, mixed with the futuristic Asian red light district feel, for the very first time in the 80s. They did it so well then. Now, well there's more neon lights and flying cars. But we seen those before...So what else can I say... The movie drags on. Harrison Ford jumps into the mix (too late but still a saving grace). We get a little bit of action. Jared Leto babbles some more. Futuristic car chase. The conclusion draws near. And yep there it is, revealed in a quick 'Gosling puts the puzzle pieces together in his head while we get fast-paced jump cuts of what we have already seen in the movie' - and done. 2hours and 44 minutes later the audience is served a lukewarm ending that screams Blade Runner part III. And that made me angry. The original movie ends with Rutger Hauer's beautiful monologue in the rain. Now that is movie magic. This, well this is the box office talking, or shouting in your face rather. 4 out 10. And best acting performance goes to the dog!",4,43,87,11 November 2017
Alien 3," The Assembly Cut brings new life to A:3
","The third installment of the Alien Saga has always been the least liked, from fans and critics alike. But today I watched the Assembly Cut for the first time and it does more justice to the story and to the trilogy. More depth to the characters. Sections removed or replaced. It is quite long at 2,5hours but it is a lot easier to watch than the theatrical cut at 2hours. I would rate the movie higher than 6/10 if it wasn't for one thing alone; the awful green-glowing (obviously) animated xenomorph. The close-ups are quite scary, but any shots of it running is laughable (yes I know it is old but the previous movie has a ton of aliens running about, and they are terrifying)! Still, the film is definitely worth a go!",6,1,1,27 December 2016
It," Pennywise returns in style; one of the best King adaptations!
","I grew up with the 1990s 'It', and I am one of those people that were forever ruined by Tim Curry and his killer clown. To this day I still really hate those red nosed brutes, and I have never set foot at a circus after watching the film - not once in 27 years! (Very clever by the way to release the film 27 years after the mini TV series! You'll get the importance of the number 27 when watching the film.)So anyway, for me, Skarsgard had some very big clown shoes to fill - and I think he did a really good job. They have not copied Curry's clown - this would've been a recipe for disaster as nobody can ever master that creepy grin and quirky (but terrifying) style. There's a new clown in town, and despite the frilly costume (that was slightly ridiculed when the first promo images came out), the modern Pennywise is actually disturbing and sends chills down your spine. King must be proud! The entire cast is a talented bunch, but It has to be said, that it is the Wolfhard kid from Stranger Things who often steals the show. His scenes got the biggest laughs throughout the movie. They have added quite a bit of humour in the film, which mixed with the scary parts worked very well. A few laughs, a few scares; the script moves us along in a good pace. it is never rushing through the plot, and neither does the film ever turn into a snoozer. Some good writing from the Palmer/Fukunaga/Dauberman trio.We visit Derry in the late 1980s, which means that Chapter 2, and the return of Pennywise the Dancing Clown, will be set in present day. Will we have a whole new generation with fear of clowns? Yes there's a good chance that Coulrophobia will yet again be on the rise - and that spotting a red balloon can only mean one thing; we all float down here!",8,6,14,10 September 2017
Hereditary," Gruesome horror - heartbreaking drama.
",This film is so good. It builds up a tragic family drama and adds an unsettling dose of mystery in in a perfect blend. A chill tauntingly runs along your back while you simultaneously feel a sad knot in the stomach. You know something is going on but can't put your finger on it. The film deceives and throws you off the track. It shocks you and makes you uneasy. As the end draws near it gets creepier and creepier and the horror finally kicks in. It doesnt rely on jump scares - this is a clever flick! Great performances throughout. The cast captures and so does the script - great job from the director to tie this bundle of feelings together into a fantastic film. Some viewers complain about the ending. But for those who follow the clues and the foreshadowing the ending should be all but a disappointment. 2hrs7min well spent.,8,2,6,12 October 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Easily the best Thor movie!
","Thor: Ragnarok did not disappoint! On the contrary, it actually blew me away. Out of the 3 Thor movies, this is without doubt the best one. Some say the humour is futile and aimed at 12 year olds. Well I am mid-30s and I had some really good laughs throughout the movie. It is cool to see the other Marvel superheroes pop up. If you're like me and not reading too much about the films and what characters they'll feature, before going to see them then you'll get a nice surprise. Also some new characters are being introduced. Korg is bound to crack you up. Everyone does a good job in this film though. Loke is still a bit of a scene stealer, but not like in the other films where he rules the roost completely. 130minutes flew by. As always the CGI is astonishing. And the Valkyries flashback scene is beautiful. Fight scenes have you excited! And frankly, any film that opens and closes with Led Zeppelin deserves an extra star! I have no problem giving Thor: Ragnarok 9 out of 10. It is up there with Guardians of the Galaxy.Pleasantly surprised! A great addition to the MCU.",9,44,77,28 October 2017
Justice League," Entertaining, but still eons from Marvel.
","So I didn't hate Justice League. And that is a big step up. I had big problems with Batman vs Superman, as well as with Wonder Woman. Batman's anger issues left me rather dumbfounded in the first, and CGI the was laughable in the latter. However JL kept me entertained and I left the cinema actually looking forward to the continuation, because let's face it, they managed to end it with a pretty good hook (and I am talking about the very end, after the closing credits, so make sure you sit though them). Anyway, let's take it from the start.Introducing the new characters. A little bit messy and un-engaging. The film tries to be funny but falls pretty flat. I compare it to latest Thor or Spidey flick where the audience laughed out loud constantly. JL got a few hah's or hehe's, maybe a giggle or two. But nobody in the theatre burst out laughing. The Flash has a naive excitement that perhaps is supposed to woo us and remind us of young Tom Holland aka Spiderman, however The Flash is quite a few years older, so he doesn't come across at all as charming, more a bit dumb. Cyborg's past is briefly hinted but he sort of just shows up all moody and it takes a while to warm up to him. Aquaman, the protector of the sea, is a pesky litter bug; thinking it is a cool move to throw a whisky bottle while walking down a pier, tsk tsk! The Villain. Aaargh! NOOOO! Not a stale CGI bad guy. Steppenwolf is a big fail and ruined a lot for me. Guardians of the Galaxy (pt1) did the same mistake with Thanos, and it is painful to watch. In Guardians however, Ronan saves the film by being a pretty badass antagonist, as well as a person. Justice League lacks that saving grace. The para demons are better CGI than Steppenwolf, and thankfully there is a lot of them!The Plot The film moves along in a good pace and there's a lot of action. JL keeps us entertained. A few flaws, like why the hell did NOBODY pay attention to the last mother box? C'mon guys that was beyond sloppy. So yeah, we all knew that Steppenwolf would snatch it at some point, but at least fight him for it... The Twist Not going to give away too much but... definitely the best part of the film! Well-needed addition to the team. Gave a great boost to the plot as well as to the on-screen chemistry between the actors. Suddenly I found that I actually quite liked The Flash. There was a bit of banter between the characters. I laughed a bit more. I enjoyed everything about the film a bit more. Wise move from the screen writers to add this superhero to the mix. Overall MUCH more likable than previous DC flicks. OK plot. Great action. The CGI had improved and specially liked scenes with The Flash (even though I think Quicksilver did v e r y similar moves in the X-men saga). Justice League delivers a good time at the movies, but - it is still miles away from the MCU. The dialogue is more stilted, the sense of humour is hit and miss and Ben Affleck's Batman has the wooden charm of a tree trunk. Once again, stay until the closing credits! 95% of the cinema goers left the theatre as soon as credits started rolling (something that never happened when going to see a Marvel. It seems DC lacks curious fans who are aware of the fact that there is ALWAYS more to come). The hook for Justice League 2 is a must see. And there is also a good laugh mid credits. Enjoy!",6,0,0,26 November 2017
Hellboy," The Red Right Hand (A very short review of Hellboy & Hellboy 2)
","Hellboy is a cool film. It has action, it has humour, it has heart, it has a truckload of kitties - now what's not to like!? It is a frankly a bad-ass movie, with a bad-ass song; Nick Cave's Red Right Hand, here performed by Pete Yorn. That scene alone is worth a couple of stars in the rating, that's how good it is. Hellboy is also a rather dark superhero film, featuring Nazi scientists where specially the gas mask clad Dr. Kroenen sticks out from the crowd as he suffers from severe body dysmorphic disorder. Another noteworthy beast is Sammael; the 'Hound of Resurrection', kill one of these monsters and two shall rise. It is a funky bunch. And I have always found it peculiar that Hellboy 2 gets a higher rating here on IMDb. It is a much lighter story and honestly, If I want to watch disgruntled trolls, then I put on the 80s classic fairy-tale Labyrinth. In Hellboy 2 the grittiness that made the first movie is replaced by slapstick and creatures which seem aimed at a much younger audience. I rather watch Hellboy 1 twice in a row than bother with the sequel. H1 gets 8/10. H2 a mere 5/10 (and that's being quite generous.. it does feature a song by Eels).",8,1,1,29 December 2016
Wonder Woman," y a W W n
","Superhero movies are my guilty pleasures. As long as they are not DC! This movie is a sleeping pill (it really feels like it is going on forever) with extremely bad CGI and over-use of either slow motion or speed up effects to try to make up for the tatty computer work. The start of the movie, with young Diana watching the Amazons training, gives a clue to how bad the CGI is. And the poor quality runs throughout the film. Films in the 90s made it better! The acting is unconvincing from most of the actors unfortunately, and huge plot holes leave you shaking your head over this 2hr20min nonsense. So, my verdict? Just don't bother! If you like this sort of stuff, do yourself a favour and re-watch something from Marvel. It is beyond me how DC is failing massively yet again to deliver a watchable movie. I have seen most from Marvel quite a few times, they are entertaining and the CGI is stunning! When it comes to WW, I could hardly get through it the 1st time around. The thought of walking out on the movie halfway through, exited me more than the movie itself.",1,26,56,31 July 2017
Amélie," Two words: Tres Magnificent! (10/10)
","I have been slightly obsessed with this film since I first watched it when it came out. Always found many French movies a tad hard to digest prior to Amelie; but this changed my mind completely. To be honest, anything by Jeunet and Caro is simply genius! This film has it all. A beautiful set and backdrop. A story you can't help but to fall in love with. A great sense of humour. Odd and quirky characters; all portrayed perfectly by the entire cast. It is one of those movies you want to go on forever. If you haven't watched Amelie yet, then you are in for a spectacular treat. It makes an unforgettable impression. If you have watched Amelie already, then hey - watch it again (and again and again)!",10,2,4,27 December 2016
