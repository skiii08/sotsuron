Skyfall," So boring I wish I would have seen Twilight instead. I hate Twilight.
","This movie was long, boring and mentally painful.The opening scene was decent action, even though a lot of it did not make sense. The rest of the movie dragged on and on with little action and a boring plot. I struggled to stay awake. The last 30 minutes I constantly yawned and shifted in my seat. If you are lucky enough to have read this before going to the show, you have been warned.I don't understand how this movie has such high user reviews on IMDb.I don't understand how a movie this bad even gets made in 2012. Granted, I know next to nothing about filmmaking and I certainly could not make something better, but the people who do this for a living do not have the same excuse.",1,23,46,15 December 2012
