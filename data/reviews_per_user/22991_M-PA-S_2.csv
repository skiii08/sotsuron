The Sound of Music," The Best / Die Beste
","Well, as an avid non-fan of musicals, what can I say? This just has it all - the beautiful scenery, the plot and the way the music is interwoven into it. And WHAT music, at that! Never is the music out of place (apart from, perhaps, in the gazebo as the young lovers perform 'I Am 16 Going On 17' or when the Matron Nun delivers her piece of advise to 'Mary'... or when...) OK OK OK So, it's not 100% water-proof, but the longevity of the piece and the brilliant performance of each and every one (the Countess's withdrawal from the marriage to the Captain must be one of the most graceful ones ever - especially considering the era!) surely makes up for any possible flaws. The anti-Nazi theme has been done a squillion times, but to manage to base a musical on the every-day chaos that ensued the Anschluss (especially with such an 'obedient' perspective such as the Austrian, rather than - let's say Russian, Polish etc.), with such panache, has got to be applauded. I don't know about you guys out there, but I would rather watch this one over and over, than watching the - obviously - more realistic Saving Private Ryan or similar even a second time. Just to hear 'Do-Re-Mi' makes me believe I actually was a kid around the time. And although I may be just that now (a kid), I certainly wasn't back then...",Null,1,7,5 November 2003
Billy Elliot," Greatest Ever!
","Well, what a boring plot. Can anyone survive the first 10 minutes?Well if they do, they're in for a TREAT!Not wishing to recount the tears I shed, nor the evidence of others having done the same, all I can say is: Give this a chance...My forte is Terminator-2, Alien-3 kind-of-stuff, but I was completely blown away by the superiority of this film, both in terms of direction, acting and message.The bluntness of the reality, courtesy UK 1984, may have been extremely difficult to cope with at the time, but - sorry - that's not something that is especially appealing when it comes to escapism for the 21st Century Lot.
If this generation is to be enticed to open its wallet in order to watch a flick, it expects a pick-u-up rather than let-u-down kind of experience.Strangely, this film developed into a very potent p-u-u as it progressed, and having - collapsed on the sofa (strangely, accidentally my eyes hitting a piece of left-over tissue)- had time to go through it once more, I can only whole-heartedly recommend it.It is simply a MARVELLOUS gem! My all time favourite!/ :) 10 out of 10",Null,0,0,1 September 2003
