Howl's Moving Castle," Miyazaki-san; Please never stop!
","'Hauru no Ugoku Shiro' was the last of all the Miyazaki-movies I saw after having seen them all in some 10 days, having been bewitched by 'Spirited Away' on one of the last days of Christmas. As always with the Japanese master, it was an outstanding feature; magical, real, intoxicating, wonderful, exciting and adventurous all at once. Still, this one, one of his last to date, was one of the best of the best.It tells the story of young Sophie, an insecure, silent and sad girl who works in her late father's hat shop. One day Sophie meets a young man who saves her from some bad soldiers. It turns out he is on the run himself, running from some strange creatures. When it seems that they are caught in the middle between them, the man suddenly jumps high up in the air, taking Sophie with him, and starts walking in the sky. That night, when Sophie is at home again, the women in charge of the followers turn up outside Sophies house...Like I've said, 'Hauru..' is an always captivating movie, just like all Miayazaki-features, but this is even one of the best of them. 9/10",8,0,1,17 January 2009
Requiem for a Dream," Fascinating, repulsive, powerful and important
","Requiem for a Dream is probably the most powerful film I have ever seen. Everything just fits here, the road to h*ll for each character just couldn't be portrayed any better. Visuals, acting, plot, message, pace...everything just hit me like a full-speeding freight train! Brutal! It is a horrible, devastating, gruesome to watch. And that's exactly how it should be, cause that's how drugs are! Drugs WILL kill you, and they'll do it slowly, painful and messy. First they'll destroy your brain, then your body and just slowly drag all life out of you. Drugs are most definitely one of the most horrific things on this earth. And still, I couldn't keep my eyes from it. I just had to follow Harry, Sarah, Marion and Tyrones destroyals of themselves, to know the end. It was a very special feeling to be both repulsed and fascinated at the same time.Another thing that fits 110% is the soundtrack. Wow! It's a fabulous score in itself, it's somewhat beautiful, scary, horrible, sad and addictive all at once, just like the picture is.Requiem for a Dream is perfect. Personally, I think this H*LLRIDE should be shown to every 13-year old on the globe. If that wouldn't drastically cut down the number of addicts I'd be surprised. Thank you Darren Aronofsky, thank you every person involved for giving us such an extraordinary powerful anti-drug movie! 10/10",9,1,1,29 January 2009
Spartacus," Proof that the 250 is a list of popularity
","On almost every movie established in the Top 250 I see this one post that claims a variant of 'Overrated, does not deserve it's place'. They feel the movie in question lacks quality. It may be true, it may not be, most often I disagree. However, the list isn't a list about quality, it is about popularity, and 'Spartacus' along with 'Ben-Hur' proves it in this genre; The Epics. This does not mean that the list hasn't quality, it has loads, it just means that it must have popularity too. There are loads of evidence, but I have already digressed enough. As long as everyone votes honestly there is no over- and underrating since everyone is entitled to their opinion no matter what the cause. As long as everyone votes honestly the IMDb Top 250 is never anything else than it should be.Now to why they prove it: 'Spartacus' is a great movie, so is 'Ben-Hur', so is 'Braveheart' and so is 'Gladiator'. They all have superior quality, but modern blockbusters will always appeal to more people. That is why the latter two, though not better movies, are 8.4 and 8.5 while the classics clock in on 8.0 and 8.1. And so it should be on a list of popularity.I don't give 10s or 1s, they are repressed when IMDb calculates the weighted rating, and so if I were to give them, I wouldn't have my say about the movies I love and hate the most. Which I naturally don't want. Also; no movie is perfect (10) or without redeeming qualities (1) anyway.'Spartacus' I give 9/10, my highest, it is an excellent picture. For reasons why it is so, watch it or read another review, I decided to point out something else in this one. You'll find excellent reasons in the other excellent reviews by other excellent film lovers here.",9,1,2,20 March 2013
Citizen Kane," Why?
","Okay. First of all, I DO like many old movies. 12 angry men, Casablanca, Where Eagles Dare, Psycho, The Treasure of Sierra Madre, The Great Dictator, Some Like it Hot and more. They're all brilliant and I enjoyed them throughout.But Citizen Kane...I just can't see what's so great about it. It made no impression on me whatsoever. When it comes to plot, camera-angles, themes, characters, acting and such, it seems like few movies are as praised as this. Still, when I read reviews on other classics, for example Casablanca, it feels like they say many of the same things.I'm not an expert on what makes some films objectively better than others, but if the other classics with most of the other 'greatnesses' actually ARE interesting and fun to watch, then Citizen Kane should also be able to entertain as well as just being 'great'.You can say what you want about movies, but no matter how well they're made, they should also entertain in some way or another to be classified as great. And I'm not one of those guys who only like action movies. An example of a great movie is Requiem for a Dream. It's disturbing, repulsive and scary as h*ll, but I couldn't keep my eyes from it, and it made a brutal impression. Other examples of movies that are deep, makes an impression AND are entertaining could be One flew over the Cuckoos Nest, The Visitor, American Beauty and Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.But entertainment isn't all. I see that. If Citizen Kane had made an impression it wouldn't fail no matter how uninteresting. Taxi Driver is another movie I bored me through, and don't want to see again, but still I find it good because I couldn't stop thinking about it afterwards. It made an impression. Citizen Kane doesn't do that either.And to all you die-hard-fans who hate me, wants to disgrace me, and finds it horrendous to call a classic 'not entertaining' I'll just quote the great Ingmar Bergman: 'Citizen Kane is a total bore!' To call me retarded or something like that would be to call one of the greatest directors of all time the same. In addition it's clear that many more agree as well. It's not long since the feature was in the top 3 on IMDb. Today it's number 29.So all in all, I may not know how to judge objective qualities of movies, but I'm certain that movies that doesn't leave any impression whatsoever AND isn't entertaining at all aren't great no matter what. And that's why 'the greatest movie ever made' fails for me. 3/10",7,76,135,2 February 2009
12 Angry Men," Outstanding movie in all ways
","'12 Angry Men' is an outstanding achievement. Why? Like in the movie, I'm gonna tell you why I think so:1.It's from 1957, it's old. (Many, mostly young, people find this negative. 2.It's in black and white (Even more doesn't even bother to try and see such movies) 3.It has a very simple plot. 4.It's shot almost entirely in a single room. 5.The budget's as low as 340.000 dollars (Citizen Kane, 16 years EARLIER had 690.000) 6.It was Sidney Lumets, the director, first movie. and 7.It consists almost entirely of dialogue.And STILL; The LOWEST average score is 7.8! (By girls under 18 of course)Throughout the feature, there is a great tension. There is so much we want to know, so much that fixes my eyes on the screen from the first minute until the end. Did the boy do it? Can number 8 convince the rest? Can he convince me? Who will be the next to have doubts? Will number 8 come up with more excellent deducing? This is the proof that great movies can be done with very small resources. All you need is a great plot and good actors. Astoundishing! 10/10",9,0,2,13 January 2009
My Neighbor Totoro," The best children's movie I've seen
","'Tonari no Totoro' is yet another masterpiece from one of the most fantastic minds in the world. Where does Hayao Miyazaki take all his magical tales from? The feature from 1988 tells us the story about Satsuki and Mei, two little girls brought up in rural Japan by their father. The movie starts when the little family are on their way to their new house, which they have moved to so they can be closer to the hospital where their ill mother is staying.One day while playing outside, four year old Mei wanders off in to the forest, following two strange little creatures. They lead her into a hollow in a enormous tree where she falls down and lands on the belly of an enormous version of the little ones. The creature gasps loudly, and Mei interprets the sound as To-to-ro, before she falls to sleep on it.This is only the start of Miyazakis magical and wonderful tale, which includes raising giant trees from little seeds, flying through the countryside on Totoro and an amazing bus who looks just like a cat and jumps instead of rolling! A must-see for every child and adults in contact with their own child inside. Miyazaki-san, I bow my head in awe. A perfect 10/10",10,0,1,12 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," On IMDb, 'Jedi' is perfect
","'Empire' had the better ending. Luke gets his hand cut off, finds out Vader is his father, uh, Han gets frozen, taken away by Boba Fett. It ends on such a down note. I mean, that's what life is, a series of down endings. All 'Jedi' had was a bunch of Muppets.' Very many Star Wars fans agree heartily with Dante Hicks from 'Clerks' on this one. They argue that primitive woodland creatures couldn't possibly defeat Empire Stromtroopers, and that Lucas added them just for the kids. Like he did with Jar Jar Binks sixteen years later.While I agree 100% about the moronic Jar Jar, I don't mind the Ewoks. I think most of the men who view 'Star Wars' as more of a lifestyle than a movie can't stand the Ewoks primarily cause it remind them that this big part of their life is somewhat aimed at older children and pre-teens. It makes them feel somewhat embarrassed, geeky and childlike for loving 'Star Wars' Of course, 'Star Wars' isn't just a movie for children and teens, but it certainly isn't 'Rated R' either. I first watched Lucas' masterpiece trilogy as a child, and found the Ewoks to be a welcome comic relief. In fact, I like 'Jedi' as much as 'Empire' and even more than the original movie. Every part of the last chapter for me is highly entertaining.Still, while I love it as much as the two other originals, I find the rating here on IMDb very appropriate. While Episode IV and V have universal acclaim among the fans, this last one has not for the reasons listed above. We still love it enough to vote it in the upper half of the Top 250, a hundred places behind the predecessors. The rating shows EXACTLY what the fans think. Perfect.",9,1,3,25 May 2011
Taxi Driver," Depressing
","Taxi Driver is an overall boring movie. In most of its running time it's depressing, uninteresting and hard to follow. Still, I can see that it succeeds in doing what I think Scorsese wanted, to portray mental sickness. There is no doubt that he is a good director, and that a movie can be well done even without much entertainment value.It must be said though that there was some interesting parts. The ending was good, and I think Foster did quite well as Iris. All the craziness of de Niro just made me depressed, but that's what made a great impression on me. Even though I just wanted to turn it off most of the time, the story about Travis depressed me so much that I just couldn't stop thinking about it for a long time. I couldn't sleep for many hours, just twisting my mind with thoughts of his miserable life. And that's the brilliant part. By showing us how hard life can be on someone, de Niro and Scorsese made a difference. Maybe some people got a different view on the 'scum' of society by watching this movie, and that is an accomplishment. All in all, even though I never wanna see it again, this is a good, but not great, movie. 7/10",9,1,1,12 January 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Arnold got his well earned vacation after this
","This is an action movie, it's a sci-fi movie and it's a thriller. And it does it well, it's very good. But what I like, actually LOVE, the most about this feature is something that it doesn't aspire to do; comedy.Arnold cracks me up as the Terminator. The dialogue between him and John when the kid tries to learn him how to speak 'cool' is simply hilarious. And even better; when he tries to smile at John's command. I laughed like I haven't in a long time. If not for anything else, just that scene alone makes this movie worth watching.So all in all it's a good movie as what it aspires to be; an action movie. The comedy gives it a little something extra and for me that's what pushes this movie up from a 7 to an 8/10. Hasta la Vista, baby!",8,0,1,5 March 2009
American History X," Pure perfection
","Edward Norton is one of the greatest actors there is, and American History X is his greatest performance. His actions, as well as those of Edward Furlong, Avery Brooks and especially Guy Torry, are flawless.It's the story of how a bright kid, Derek Vinyard (Norton), with wrong ideas gets in to a skinhead-gang because of a cunning leader who uses him for his own purposes, to establish nazism in America. Its frightening to see how much Dereks racistic opinions makes sense when hes arguing for them, I almost found myself agreeing with Derek(!), and its easy to understand how some people have gone so bad because of group mentality.Then, when we watch Dereks life in prison, it feels like i'm being redempted myself. He befriends a black guy (Torry), learns how he got more years there for stealing a TV than Derek got for his double murder, and he is astounded. He (we) suddenly see through his clever arguing, and discover how stupid his ideas really is.This is a hands down MIGHTY movie, and one of the best you will ever see. A solid 10/10",9,4,5,10 January 2009
Spirited Away," Domo Arigato!
","Domo Arigato (thank you very much) to all the voters who gave this feature such an high score and guided me to see how superior 'Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi' is even to the best Disney and Pixar films. To be much better than 'Ratatouille', 'The Lion King' and 'The Incredibles' is quite an achievement. I had never thought that I would see animated features better than those. Cause I really like Disney/Pixar though it seems almost boring next to this.Chihiro is a nervous little girl who's on the move with her parents. When they're on the way to their new home, they get lost on a road into the woods and ends up in a tunnel who leads to something they think is an abandoned amusement park. When the parents start eating from a table full of delicious food who just happens to be on a table in this place, the day turns to night, her parents turn to pigs and the world changes to something scary, weird and completely different...This tale is the work of geniuses. I have never seen such an always captivating film filled to the brim with wonderful and unique characters, as well as an original, exciting and constantly surprising story. The feature contains an amazing mixture of adventure, action and drama with some drops of cream comedy on the top. I simply couldn't take my eyes away from the screen a second of the two hours, two hours who felt more like 30 minutes. It is such extraordinary entertainment to watch Chihiro using the power of courage and love to save her loved ones. I could keep going on with the superlatives but you have probably taken my point by now. I definitely recommend this movie in Japanese with subtitles. It simply feels much more natural that way than it does dubbed. All in all 'Spirited away' is the best animated feature and even one of the best films I have ever seen. I nearly never give movies 10/10 but this time I simply must.",9,2,4,29 December 2008
Flashdance," Great music, poor movie
","'Flashdance' from 1983 is a poor movie. To me it seems just like a bunch of music videos played after each other, and the already plain story obviously suffers from this. Jennifer Beals stars as Alex Owens, a working-class girl working as a welder during the day and as a dancer each night. Her dream is to obtain a place in a prestigious dance school. One night her boss at the steel mill, Nick, (Michael Nouri) sees her dancing in the club, and he immediately becomes attracted to her. You can probably guess the rest of the movie yourself, thats how predictable and 'seen-before' it is.I can see why the feature is loved by someone though; I found Beals charming as Alex and Nouri quite alright as Nick and I loved the soundtrack, which is amazing and got a well earned Oscar. It doesn't hurt with beautiful and sexy leads, 80's spirit, music and dancing either. A typical teen-movie.One star for Jennifer Beals, one for the eighties and Flashdance's teen-appeal and two stars for one of the best movie soundtracks ever. 5/10",6,1,3,28 December 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," I liked it, but...
","That's sadly mainly because of my enjoyment to be back in the universe by Tolkien on screen. There was another IMDb-reviewer here who called it 'enjoyable but flawed', and that is exactly what it is. I gave it an 8/10 because I loved to be back in the world of Tolkien and Jackson but as a movie it isn't more than a 6, and here's why:It seems to me that Jackson was too interested in portraying the appendices. Remember that the Lord of the Rings was adapted into a modern classic in 11 hours (in the extended versions) and The Hobbit is a book somewhere around 10 times shorter. Why don't just adapt it into one film 160 minutes in the theatrical version and then go for a 200 minutes (or so) extended cut? Then he probably could've found a way to adapt the appendices as a link between The Hobbit and LotR for next Christmas. If the second movie had become a failure as a result of difficulty in doing so, at least we would've had a great movie about The Hobbit in stead of three somewhat more or less mediocre. I can't see a way the two next ones can avoid the same narrative problem.The problem is that unlike LotR, it is only an enjoyable experience for the Tolkien-fans, not others, because it simply isn't great. The narrative doesn't fit together, it feels like more action than Tolkien and a breaking point in such a lightweight novel is wrong. This movie will sustain Tolkien fans, not increase them, as the great previous trilogy did.Still, some of its parts are great. I loved the riddle-scene with Gollum as well as most of what happens before the unexpected journey, and I can't say it wasn't fun seeing the White Council at work even though it is part of the destruction of the Hobbit-story. It fits in my vision about an appendices-movie.Conclusion: Reviewed from the perspective of a film-enthusiast, which I am, it is a 5 or a 6 for the reasons mentioned above. It isn't cinematic greatness in other aspects than the wrapping (visually). For a starved Tolkien enthusiast it is a 9, also for the reasons above. Together it is a 7,5 for now.",6,5,17,19 December 2012
Lawrence of Arabia," 4 epic hours of being T. E. Lawrence
","Almost 4 hours is a very long movie. Very long. So I sat down and watched with great expectations: To gain an 8.6 average from so many people, these four hours will have to seem like 2! And indeed it did. From start to intermission after 140 minutes I was very pleased. I had enjoyed Lawrences trip to and visit of the Prince, his journey through the Nefud desert, his meeting with tribe-leader Auda, his attack on Aqaba and his voyage to Sinai and back to the Brits. It was beautiful, exciting, entertaining and fascinating. I absolutely LOVED Peter O' Toole as Lawrence! Alec Guinness was excellent as Feisal and the acting was generally great. I REALLY cared for the characters. It was wonderful to really FEEL something strong for them, and it came from the marvelous acting. The scenery, the music and the storytelling was also flawless and breathtaking. The epics first 140 minutes had felt like 60.Lawrence continues his quest for the Arabs, he leads them into guerrilla war against the Turks, and everything still goes his way. But he starts losing men. The Arabs goes home to their respective tribes after having earned money and goods from robbing the Turks trains. With only twenty men left, he is caught while scouting the enemy-held city Daraa. He is severely beaten and thrown out in the street.Lawrence, now a traumatized man from this experience, just wants to be an ordinary British soldier again. And I really feel with him. It's like I just wanna go home to. Lawrence is then convinced by his superior general that he needs to go back to the Arabs to take Damascus for their cause. He succeeds in taking the city, but the Arabs are tribes, not a nation, and can't maintain administration over the city together. In the end the Arabs go back to their tribes while Lawrence goes home to Britain a defeated man.This movie's second part is harder than the first, and that can definitely be seen as negative. But in my point of view it actually SHOULD be like this. Why? Because Lawrence has it so much harder and tougher in the second part, and when it feels longer it's because we feel with him! Everything takes longer time when you're not enjoying it right? And besides the greatness I've mentioned about the first part, that is what makes this movie so great: It takes you so deeply into Lawrences situation that you feel EXACTLY as he does! The movie captures the mood perfectly. Stunning! 9/10",8,0,1,5 March 2009
Up," Good, but not as good as the hype says
","First it must be said that Up is a good movie. It doesn't fade next to Ratatouille, Wall-E or any other of Pixars greatest. It is fun for kids as well as adults, it makes you care about the characters, the animation is flawless and the plot keeps your attention every second. Still, Up is one of the strongest arguments for closing the vote until the hype has passed (Maybe until the movie has been released on DVD?) Along with movies like The Dark Knight, Star Trek and the other Pixar Wall-E it makes me more and more certain that this is the solution. Don't get me wrong, I loved both Wall-E and the Dark Knight, but there still is no way that they're as great as the ratings say. Besides, Star Trek was plain awful. Slumdog Millionaire is probably the only hyped movie I can think of that has landed on an appropriate rating in the end. Anyway, I recommend Up, it is a good movie you and your kids probably will want to see again and again if you are a Pixar fan, and if you're not I recommend it all the same. 7/10.",7,2,4,11 June 2009
A Clockwork Orange," Glorifying violence?! No way!
","I read on Wikipedia that this film has been accused of glorifying violence? What the heck? Only people as sick as Alex DeLarge can like and be hungry for more of this after watching him for two hours. Only sociopaths. Alex DeLarge is a sick, sick character. I felt repulsed, angry, sick and hateful watching him and his doings. It felt good to see him get arrested and tortured by his treatment. But it hit me that when he got his treatment, the doctors and the politicians responsible was doing virtually the same things to him. They took away Alex's free will by torturing him, threw him out on the street unable to defend himself and when he got beaten up and tortured by the people he had offended earlier in the movie it was really the governments fault. They almost killed him and was applauded for it, even though they were just as evil as him, cause they knew they didn't make him a better man, they were fully aware that they were just restricting him violently to make him a better man TO SOCIETY. And I felt sick. Just like Alex I felt really nauseous. It all felt so meaningless. Everyone and everything was sick, everyone was violated, everyone got hurt, everyone just thought of themselves and not of others. It made me wanna throw up! The government just wanted to use Alex, first to front their new program, then to ensure that he didn't give them bad publicity after their treatment almost killed him. Yes, he is a sick sociopath, but so is the government people. They say that Kubricks intention with Clockwork was to attack the treatment. And its probably true, but for me this is just as much a study of all that is bad in mankind, and it really made me feel how bad we humans can be! In the end, Alex turns out just as bad as he started, maybe even worse, because of the violent treatment. And he's glad for it. He's back on the track of violence and raping and he is LOVING it. In Alex' own words: 'I was cured all right'. The violence made him worse. The bastards made the bastard worse.Many movies glorifies violence. But never before has a movie made me feel THIS repulsed by it. Now, an hour after seeing the movie, I still feel like crap. Violence makes nothing but more violence, and no one can be cured from anything by violent means. This movie showed me, made me FEEL that one thing clearer than anything has ever done before: Nothing good comes out of violence! Absolutely NOTHING! It just strengthens, expands and makes evil. I had never thought that I would love to be repulsed by a movie.We should think about that after watching violent action movies. Why do we enjoy violence so much? And I'm the first to say that I do so myself! I find movies like Die Hard very entertaining. But why? After all it is horrible, and that is what makes A Clockwork Orange a masterpiece, what makes it unique; it makes us feel the horror of violence and evil. No other movies that I can think of does that, at least not in such a degree that I have felt literally near vomiting. And that effect is outstanding, cause that's how we ought to feel. In a way, Die Hard is a much more dangerous movie to see for children than this, cause it portrays violence as cool and entertaining. And THAT is scary!So I ask myself: Can you really like and be fascinated by a movie this repulsive? Yes, when it is horrible for a purpose! And the purpose is strong messages against violence and perhaps even more important against the 'justified violence', that the society does for 'the common good'. I would very much like to give 10/10 but the middle-part could've been paced/altered slightly, so I'll settle for a strong 9/10. Perhaps Kubricks greatest.",9,3,6,6 March 2009
Psycho," Great movie, greater soundtrack
","'Psycho' is a movie nearly everyone has heard of, either through the movie itself, or through the countless references to it in the media. And so it should be; it is undeniable one of the best horror-experiences in cinema ever as well as a timeless cultural icon.The story about Marion Crane, how she has to run away having stolen 40.000 dollars, leads her to an old motel out of the main road. The owners name is Norman Bates... From here there isn't long until the famous shower-scene, and that's even just the beginning of the movie.What makes this movie so great is the tension, the uneasy feeling that something isn't right, present throughout the whole feature. The key-factor in this tension is the soundtrack, one of the greatest ever. One would have to be a psycho like Bates himself to not feel uneasy when listening to 'Murder' by Bernard HermannWhen I saw the whole movie for the first time last night, I actually knew the story first. Still, because of the immense power of 'Psycho' i had trouble getting to sleep. I saw Norma Bates in every corner of my room. This just proves that it is an outstanding feature and the greatest horror flick I have seen. 9/10",9,1,1,16 January 2009
To Kill a Mockingbird," Atticus Finch, an honourable man!
","The best part about this movie is Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. Such a character! Never does he move an inch from what he stands for, what he believes in, and that is justice! He is amazing in the courtroom, with his children and when coping with everything and everyone. Atticus Finch does it all right, he knows exactly how to behave in every situation. His character alone makes this movie worth seeing.The movie starts with portraying the daily life of Atticus's two children, Jem and Scout, as they run around the neighbourhood mainly daring each other to get as near as possible to the house of a town original. They are two ordinary kids of 10 and 6, most often doing exactly the opposite of what they're told. Sometimes it's amusing watching them do their mischief, but what amused me most was the fact that they always called their dad 'Atticus' and not 'dad'. It made me chuckle more than once.The plot thickens when Finch takes the case of defending Tom Robinson, a black man, from having allegedly raped a white girl. Atticus gets VERY unpopular for taking the case, and even has to sit outside the prison guarding Robinson the night before trial so that the men of the town won't come and shoot the man. From here on comes one powerful scene after another with Atticus Finch's power in front.This movie values equality, justice and strength of character. It shows very clear, yes like many other movies but still, the dreadful injustice racism can give, and has given so many times. Along with Peck's flawless performance, Brock Peters, James Anderson and all the kids also does superb acting. Absolutely worth seeing. 8,5/10",9,0,1,8 March 2009
Goodfellas," Good movie but...
","Haven't we seen it all many times before? A boy wants to be a gangster, he becomes a gangster, he rises in ranks, gets very influential, very much money, girls, wives, drugs, killings, robberies and it all becomes to much for him. He can't cope and in the end he is redempted. To me it was just another gangster-movie.Anyway, I found it enjoyable; the first half was good entertainment, and I found myself very interested in continuing watching. The story of Henry Hill was somewhat fascinating although it felt like I had seen it before. But then again, after some 100 minutes I'd had enough. The killings, drugs, money and 'gangster-stuff' had done it's time and I just wanted to see how it ended and be over with it.It must be said that I'm not a big fan of gangster-movies or Scorsese in general, but I can see that this is a good movie, although weaker than 'The Departed', a very good, more original and Scorseses best, movie.In conclusion 'Goodfellas' is fairly entertaining, a movie I will watch again if it happens to be on TV on a boring day, but I won't buy it on DVD. Goodfellas is good, it's not great, and therefore overrated. 7/10",7,1,3,18 January 2009
The Birds," Thrilling, but oh so meaningless!
","Okay, Hitchcock does know how to build up suspense. Long before the birds first started to attack I sat anxious waiting for it to come. It didn't...until later. This kept me on the edge of my seat. But: Characters are dull, uninteresting and simple. The love story between Melanie and Mitch couldn't interest me less. As so with the characters of Lydia, Cathy and Annie. Secondly; That birds should do something like that is just stupid, and I didn't find it scary at all. What was so very frightful about Hitchcocks earlier film, Psycho, was that that was REAL. Someone could end up like Norman Bates, actually people HAVE done so, and that scared me quite significantly. But, birds aren't psychos. It's just plain meaningless.Hitchcock made, as always, a thrilling movie. The main plot with the birds, though weird, was interesting to follow. But characters were boring, ending was pointless, and it just wasn't scary at all. Horror movie? If you get freaked out by impossible happenings, be my guest, but The Birds fails for me. 4/10",6,7,13,19 January 2009
