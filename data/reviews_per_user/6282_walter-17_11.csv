Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as bad as the critics claimed
","I am not a fan of Star Wars.  Okay I do like that part about the force; but I have never been impressed with the acting, action, or story.The acting has been improved greatly in this one.If you have the money, make a movie.  However, I think we all could have lived without experiencing this movie.",Null,0,0,23 August 1999
The 13th Warrior," For Women Who Like Tough Looking Men
","The supporting cast and story gets a 7, Antonio Banderas brings it down to a 6.5.Antonio Banderas looked like a whimp amoung men.  If these same men were in jail Antonio would have been their... girlfriend.Luckily, he magically learned their language overnight; and this was not a movie about life in jail.However, Antonio played the part of the weakling very well.The women who to see Antonio Banderas be macho will have plenty of other men to keep their interest.I was impressed with the manly manness of this group.  I was like watching the Magificent Seven with a whimpy sidekick played by Antonio Banderas.",7,0,0,29 August 1999
The Mummy," A good old time
","If you can resist picking out the flaws in a movie, The Mummy can make for a good choice of entertainment. Branden Fraser was his usual self. Mark my words, girls will fall in love with this guy if they ever let him play a serious romantic role.It was nice to Rachel Weisz again. I hadn't seen her since her role in Chain Reaction. In this movie she was also playing an intelligent woman who doesn't seem to realize how attractive she is.I gave it a 6/10",6,0,0,23 August 1999
Notting Hill," Not bad
",This movies had some very good actors in it (see the family dinner scene). And some very funny characters (roommate).The character development in this movie ranks up there with that in the movie Armageddon.I saw it at the movie and in about a year I would not mind seeing it again.7+/10,7,0,0,23 August 1999
Armageddon," Second Best Picture of 1998
",I would have given this movie a 10 if it were not for Bruce Willis poor acting at the end.Ben Affleck -- Damn Good Actor!  I first noticed him in Good Will Hunting and he hasn't let me down since.Music -- Best Song of the Year!Liv was perfect for this part.My hat off to the screen writer for developing those very interesting characters in such a short amount of timeBruce Willis brought it down9/10,9,5,8,21 August 1999
Good Will Hunting," Matt Damon & Ben Affleck need I say more?
","This was the first time I had ever seen Ben Affleck in a movie and I was very impressed!I don't usually go to movies just because of the actors in it, but I will make an exception for Matt Damon.After picking this guy as a future super star back when he was playing as Mork on Mork and Mendy, it is good to see Robin Williams get the Oscar that I predicted (actually I predicted a nomination).Damon's girlfriend in the movie was the only weak link in the movie. I don't know if it was just poor acting or just an unbelievable character.If you liked this movie see Rounders.8/10",Null,0,1,21 August 1999
The Game," Add to your collection
","For anybody who likes a surprise ending and a well acted movie, The Game is a movie you will want to see.While The Game is not something that is likely to ever happen in the real world, its still interesting.I would like to see a movie like this about Corporate America. You know. With all the back-stabbing, ladder climbing, and ass kissing that goes on in the tall building one can never really tell who they can trust or who really has your interests in mind when they give you advice.Well, The Game has a lot of surprising twists and turns and a very good ending.9/10 I should have given it a ten. The entire cast acted very good with one exception -- Deborah Unger was great.",9,0,1,2 September 1999
Meet Joe Black," Beautifully Done - Best Movie of the Year
","I fell in love with Claire Forlani.  Now I see why everybody loves Brad Pitt.  I'm not surprized that he won an Oscor for is work in 12 Monkeys. He deserved one for Legends of The Fall too.  However, Claire Forlani made this movie work and I am very disappointed that she did not at least get a nomination in some category.I enjoyed Armageddon, but Meet Joe Black is special.11/10",Null,0,0,21 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Married? Don't Go. Thinking about marriage? Go.
","Not even the great skills of Tom Cruise could save this movie.The writer did a great job of developing the characters.The movies seems to be somebody's attempt to share the most interesting things that have happened in one's life.  The only thing is that they didn't seem to connect very well.  It was like lets go to shocking scene 1... action... cut... now lets go to shocking scene 2... action... cut... etc.They could have made five different interesting movies by expanding/going into more details in each of those shocking scenes.  Instead, I felt that I was being jurked back and forth and left and right and waiting to see what the point was only to be disappointed. Now how does all of this affect the marriage?  Those who have been married for several years will find this movie a waste of time.  Those thinking about getting married may find it enlightening.Since I've been married for 14 years, I gave it a 5/10",5,0,0,23 August 1999
The Iron Giant," Had so much more potential
","Obviously somebody decided to not try and make the movie more interesting to the adults.  Another 10 more minutes of character development and this movie could have been compared to Lion King.There were very few ups and downs.  No playing with your emotions.  That's what I expect from a movie.However, I do expect a sequel.7/10",7,1,2,21 August 1999
Tarzan," Go!
","I liked the movie.  I didn't like Minnie Driver in Good Will Hunting, but she was great in this role as Jane.It is a good movie for the family.I like Phil Collins.  However, the same voice through out the movie just did not work for me.  I was very tired of hearing Phil Collins by the time the movie ended.I gave it a 7/10",7,1,1,23 August 1999
