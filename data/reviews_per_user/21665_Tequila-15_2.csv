Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great effects but dull story!
","The film shows the greatest computer effects ever made for movies. It seems that what can be seen on the screen is now only limited by the director's fantasy.BUT great special effects alone (even when they are made by a computer) do not make a great movie.The story is so boring, at the end I was glad the movie was over. And you can say I am a big fan of Star Wars.Hopefully, the next one will be better...",2,0,1,8 September 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Cool special effects, skip the rest!
","A cool movie to watch with popcorn in your hands, the special effects are of another kind - really great! But the problem with the story is that there is no story. Several times I thought, ok, just stop talking this semi-philosophical s*** and get back to the action! Do yourself a favour and rent the DVD, so you can fast-forward the rest. Hopefully they will implement such a feature so one can only see the action scenes. 5/10",5,0,0,24 May 2003
