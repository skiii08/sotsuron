Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Thurman finally gets to Kill Bill as Tarantino's genius comes shining through.
","Rating: ***** (out of *****)I labelled Volume One of Kill Bill a 'straightforward, arty and sometimes overly pretentious hybrid of The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. I expected Volume Two to simply provide more of the same and nothing else. I even thought it would be the same length as Volume One.In this case, I really like being wrong.Quentin Tarantino's and Uma Thurman's long-term project has successfully met its aim. Both have now truly redeemed themselves, Tarantino for splitting this film in two, Thurman for her turns in Batman & Robin and The Avengers. I now doubt if the split really was a completely commercial decision, although maybe Vol. 1 could have been a little shorter and added onto the back of Vol. 2. Mind you, that's a minor complaint. Anyway, on with the show. The assassin still only known to us as The Bride (Uma Thurman) must complete her revenge against those who thought they'd done away with her at that wedding massacre. With O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green dealt with in Vol. 1, The Bride now has to take care of Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and, of course, Bill himself (David Carradine). But, as we have already seen (in Volume One) and are about to find out to a greater degree, that definitely won't be easy.Most of the dialogue in Vol. 1 could have easily passed for anything in a typical action movie. By contrast, what you hear in Vol. 2 is more in-depth and moralistic. Crucially, the characters are more human, especially our two leads - this largely results from the film's flashbacks. The old Pulp Fiction strengths show signs of creeping back.Certainly, there are plenty of treats in store for film goers in Vol. 2, one of which is the discovery of The Bride's name, but the film has other great moments as well. My personal favourite was the flashback showing us The Bride's training at the hands of Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). Close second was the funny, extremely interesting and surprisingly heart-warming denouement. Tarantino has shown us both his dark side (mostly in Vol. 1) and light side (mostly in Vol. 2), and when merged together, they click astoundingly well.Uma Thurman amazed me with her convincing, no-nonsense approach in Vol. 1, but in Vol. 2 she impresses even more. Emotionally, she is believable. And tough she certainly is. Yet she takes second stage to David Carradine. He's said before how grateful he is to Tarantino for revitalising his career. This particular career decision has paid off. Bill is more of a gentleman than many central villains Â– so much so that you actually pity him a little when his inevitable fate arrives. This isn't the case for Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah, who simply devour their parts.If you're still puzzled by now about why I am so astounded, it is simply because Vol. 2 doesn't just make Kill Bill more of a real film, but also a completely different film. It's not always pleasant to watch, and it's not exactly what you'd call a stunning artistic achievement, but ultimately, it is thoroughly rewarding cinema. And I'll take that over any self-important art film any day.",Null,0,1,25 May 2004
Walk the Line," Walks a fine line between success and failure
","Walk The Line is the latest Oscar-baiting biopic, the subject in this case being twenty-five years in the life of Johnny Cash (played as an adult by Joaquin Phoenix). Naturally, his rise to the peak of his success as a recording artist is chronicled, but additionally, his relationships with his father (Robert Patrick), first wife (Ginnifer Goodwin) and fellow band member June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) play a prominent part in this tale, as well as his personal battle against the pills.A really, really good biopic could have been made out of this. And it should have been. So why hasn't it been? After all, the actors play their parts so well (more on them later) and the music in the film is so good (more on that later too). Alas, something is lacking in the script department.An uplifting tour through Johnny Cash's life will certainly satisfy most viewers. But as a Cash novice, I wanted something of more substance. Something that would help us understand Cash's character more, rather than just routinely showing us what he did. Director James Mangold not only fails to develop the characters convincingly enough (yeah, we see the two leads' families, but little else) but also struggles to retain hold of a meandering narrative that sometimes bores. Some emotional scenes don't hit the mark, and Mangold has a tendency to hammer home the few rather banal messages that his script has for us. (When watching the film, I thought 'Alright James, we get it!' at least twice.) Yes, Cash fans. I do realise that you may not notice most, if not all, of the things I complained about above. But we have to take all viewers into account here.Anyway, onto the positives...Joaquin Phoenix has established himself as one of the decade's most dependable actors. Four films he has starred in (Gladiator, Quills, Buffalo Soldiers, Hotel Rwanda) have been among my favourite films of their respective year of release. It's somehow ironic that Walk The Line will not be one of those, for his portrayal of Johnny Cash is definitely one of his better portrayals. It's especially enjoyable to watch him perform Cash's material on stage (and yes, he did sing the songs himself). Unfortunately, the script doesn't allow him to inhabit Cash's character entirely, and that may well cost him the Oscar.As June Carter, Reese Witherspoon brings her usual charm back to the screen. Thankfully, there are no traces of Elle Woods in this down-to-earth portrayal. She even manages to flesh her character out a little near the end of the film. It's not quite an Oscar-worthy performance, but it is very impressive nonetheless. She and Phoenix help to keep you almost consistently interested in the proceedings, and the supporting cast capably assist them.Finally...I must mention the music. The decision to hire O Brother, Where Art Thou?'s composer, T-Bone Burnett, was inspired. Don't be surprised to find yourself humming some of the songs you hear after you have seen the film.The above elements are enough to make Walk The Line a watchable film, if not a particularly inspired one. One thing it has definitely done is make me interested in finding out more about the life, times and music of Johnny Cash. I'm sure it may do the same for others who are relatively new to Cash's material.",6,2,5,3 February 2006
Mission: Impossible III," M:I III, 'Alias' Tom's latest mission, is quite forgettable
","Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back in action for his latest Impossible Mission; to track down arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and rescue his new wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan). He is aided by his old buddy Luther (Ving Rhames), Zhen (Maggie Q) and Declan (Jonathan Rhys Meyers)...Tom Cruise has not had it as easy as he'd like these days, has he? That infamous 'out of the closet' South Park episode, in addition to his blatant showboating of his relationship with Katie Holmes, has left him looking less like the dependable low-key leading man he can be, and more like the smug, insufferable wannabe scenery-chewer he also can be. Alas, the third incarnation of Ethan Hunt, his Mission: Impossible alter ego, comes closest to the latter. It's not that the performance is awful, but let's just say that all that publicity has not helped his cause at all.It also casts a huge shadow over Mission: Impossible III (hereafter M:I III). The film is loaded with problems, and they don't just exist within the film itself - a change in director and the loss of the likes of Scarlett Johansson from the cast didn't help the film's production. Nevertheless, I had good reason to be optimistic - the final, credited director was none other than J.J. Abrams, the man behind my current favourite TV show, Alias.For those of you uninitiated with the world of Alias, let me briefly bring you up to speed with what it offers - complex characters, excellent acting (Melissa George excluded), numerous plot twists and brilliantly staged action sequences, all topped with elements of suspense and intrigue.Abrams' skill with some of the above elements help to redeem M:I III to an extent. Some of the action sequences towards the end of the film are quite gripping, if not breathtaking, there are plot twists (even if a couple are preposterous), and most of the second half of the film is suspenseful.And, of course, that terrific theme tune is all over the place. (What would the film be without it?) Unfortunately, something else is all over the place - the first half of the film, which is incoherent as well as being uninvolving.Also, being his first film, it seems that Abrams is frustrated at not having the additional time you get in TV shows to develop your characters. It shows - both Davian and Julia are written as little more than plot devices. Yet Philip Seymour Hoffman (who's always good) and Michelle Monaghan rise above the material to make these people interesting. In fact, thanks to Hoffman, Davian is the best of the M:I villains to date (ahead of the slightly irritating Jon Voight and the low-key Dougray Scott). His Almost Famous co-star, Billy Crudup, is also impressive, though Ving Rhames and Jonathan Rhys Meyers are both underused.Now if the problems I've discussed so far were the only problems the film had, then I'd recommend it. But there's more. If you thought the shakycam was overused in The Bourne Supremacy, you ain't seen nothing yet; every single one of the fight scenes is very difficult to follow.And is it just me, or do Simon Pegg and Laurence Fishburne bring certain characters from Alias to mind? Are the IMF headquarters reminiscent of the Alias' CIA offices? It only shows a lack of imagination on Abrams' part when he seems to be cannibalising from his own show.I understand that M:I III will probably be more appealing to those who haven't seen Alias. But I suspect that even they will be underwhelmed. I know from seeing his TV work that J.J. Abrams can do much better than this cobbled together, recycled effort.J.J., you have the potential to become a good film director, but you've a long, long way to go. As for this film's position in the M:I series, well, it's an improvement over the last one, but that's not saying much. I certainly won't lose sleep if there isn't another entry in the series.",5,0,1,8 May 2006
Dawn of the Dead," Capable casting aids suitably scary, partly campy cult remake.
","Rating: *** (out of *****)I hereby pronounce that the remake of 1978's Dawn of the Dead is among the best of the cheap horror films that I've seen in the last few years. Slick and gory without becoming too camp, it doesn't cop out, doesn't bore and even has some wit. The message of the film is simple - stop the zombies from spreading. They're everywhere! As the poster for the film says, there wasn't enough room for them in hell. And even if you do manage to escape, don't let them bite!The film doesn't have the kind of character that great horror really needs, but I don't think it ever aspires to such a level. It's just a slasher film with the enemy within being zombies instead of deranged psychos, serial killers or werewolves. It has a tone reminiscent of the overlooked British werewolf flick, Dog Soldiers - that is, quite sardonic & clever, as well as genuinely chilling when you least expect it.Capable casting is one of the reasons that the film works at all - during the film, you really do feel suspense and a certain degree of pity for the protagonists, even though the character-building moments seem pretty obligatory. It's especially nice to see Sarah Polley (who I haven't seen since 1999's Go) back in action, and Ving Rhames's presence is always welcome (though it's odd to see him in a low budget film).OK, Dawn of the Dead is silly and unoriginal. But what would be the point of it if it wasn't at least a little of the former? All I know is, after the Wrong Turns and Michael Myers' unwelcome resurrections, you'll find this to be quite a scary surprise.",Null,0,0,4 April 2004
Shaun of the Dead," More Britcoms should be like this
","SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004)Director: Edgar WrightStarring: Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Kate Ashfield, Dylan Moran, Lucy Davis, Penelope Wilton, Bill NighyIn a year where the zombie flick has all but been resuscitated, what with the enjoyable remake of Dawn Of The Dead and a sequel for Resident Evil (although the less said about that, the better), it's kind of funny that the best film of this kind to come out has been more funny than frightening. Former 'Spaced' co-collaborators Simon Pegg (who also plays the title character) and Edgar Wright treat us to their own homage to George A. Romero's Living Dead films, ably assisted by a likable cast. Basically, Shaun Of The Dead is what it says it is on the cover - a (very amusing) romantic comedy with zombies. One that manages to be scary and quite touching despite its non-serious approach. If it weren't for the gore (which we now have to accept as a necessity in zombie films) I'd recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it without a doubt. Suffice to say the target audience won't care (and they'll love the soundtrack as well, I'm sure), but we've got to think of everyone here. That said, after having seen this I seriously believe that more British comedies should follow Pegg and Wright's approach. (NOTE: The DVD contains many worthwhile extras. And, apparently, Pegg and Wright have landed cameo parts in George Romero's next zombie film - Land of the Dead.)Rating: **** (out of *****)",Null,0,1,10 October 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Solid gold
","Rating: **** (out of *****)Every year has a hidden treasure, and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl is 2003's. When I saw the name of Jerry Bruckheimer attached to this a few months ago, I expected a no-brainer. Well, I am very happy to confirm that all the positive advance word you'll have heard regarding the film is true. Hulk and T3 are both solid but leave you with an empty feeling. Pirates doesn't. The writers of Shrek, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, have come up with a believable pirate story that is full of wit and one-liners, never taking itself seriously while not being obviously camp. I guess you could call it your typical story of saving the damsel in distress from the pirates, except there's a major twist. Pirate captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is jailed for several crimes he committed on an island in the Caribbean governed by British governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce). Later, when a group of 'evil' pirates led by Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) capture the governor's daughter, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) tries to rescue her (well, he's had a crush on her since he was youngÂ…). But he realises he can't do this on his own, so he helps get Sparrow out of prison in exchange for the pirate's help. Both are soon to find out that Barbossa's motives for capturing Elizabeth are more complicated than expected.Pirates differs from your average blockbuster in three ways: One, the script may not be a work of literature, but it never cheats the audience's intelligence. Two, patriotism and manipulation are not overdone. And three, the visuals are good, but they don't take centre stage.If Pirates wasn't a little bit too long, it would actually be almost perfect. Still, there are many things about Pirates that I can't praise enough. One of these is the fine cast. Johnny Depp's slurred Cockney accent may cause some of the film's fine one-liners to be missed, but, with a performance that is almost as camp as it is cocky & energetic, his importance to the film cannot be underestimated. Nearly everything revolves around him, and he doesn't let the proceedings down.He doesn't overshadow everyone else though. Geoffrey Rush is suitably menacing and chilling, while the youngsters don't disappoint either. Orlando Bloom has built on the strengths that we saw in the Lord of the Rings films and shows that he is more than capable of handling more singular roles. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth doesn't fall into the category of being too tough or too weak, instead a nice mixture of both. Knightley finds the perfect way of playing her character, and it doesn't hurt that she looks great as well. British comedy fans will spot Jack Davenport of Coupling and Mackenzie Crook of The Office (playing a pirate with a CG-'eye'; you'll see what I mean when you watch the film), neither of whom are out of place.Pirates has many nice touches. Several scenes that you think will finish `by the book' suddenly become more compelling scenes or battles. Pirates keeps you hooked because something good or great always happens when you least expect it. Plus, even if stunt doubles were required for some of the swordfights, that doesn't prevent them from being entertaining (although I personally preferred the ship-to-ship battles). And, for those who care, there are some clever nods to the film's theme park inspiration.This film has single-handedly restored my faith in the Hollywood blockbuster.",Null,0,1,10 August 2003
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," The King, The Queen and everything else is in The Wardrobe - including excitement?
","Even in an age that includes such highly regarded fantasies as The Lord Of The Rings, C.S. Lewis's Chronicles Of Narnia are still beloved by many. Not that I would know, having read very little of the books (shame on me, I know), but I enjoy a good fantasy as much as the next person, and with Harry Potter and LotR successfully reinventing the fantasy genre in the 21st century, The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe seemed like an adaptation to look forward to.Especially at Christmas. Last Christmas, we'd had the very entertaining Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events. Alas, it has not lingered long in the memory, and I fear that this adaptation, despite being entertaining, will follow suit. Like Lemony Snicket, it wants to be a young children's fantasy, and succeeds on that level to a greater extent. After all, it has a higher pedigree. The problem only begins when director Andrew Adamson (of Shrek fame) starts trying to emulate Peter Jackson.This, the first of the Chronicles Of Narnia (there should be many more to come) begins with the four Pevensie children - Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) sent to the house of Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent) during World War II. While playing a game of hide and seek, Lucy decides to hide in the wardrobe, and while moving towards the back, finds herself in the kingdom of Narnia. Many surprises and adventures follow, not just for Lucy, but for all the Pevensie kids.I think there are many treats in store for those who haven't read the book. Now I knew that Narnia was 'in the wardrobe' (who didn't?) but I didn't anticipate the several interesting characters and remarkable visuals that were to be seen in Narnia. Not that they eclipse the young leads - all four are credible, and I'm sure they will go on to even bigger things. The biggest names in the cast - Jim Broadbent (in a cameo) and Tilda Swinton, don't disappoint, with Swinton being especially chilling as the White Witch. Recognisable voices are all over the place, from Ray Winstone to Dawn French to Liam Neeson.Friends of mine have told me the film is very faithful to the book. That seems like another huge plus point, and in a way I suppose it is. But it's worth pointing out that what works so well on the page does not always work so well on the screen. I discovered this when watching Tim Burton's attempts to recreate classic moments from Charlie And The Chocolate Factory; however well he did them technically, they lacked a spark.It seems that Adamson realises this, and it's at that point he enters LotR territory. Before long you will see (POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING) birds soaring from overhead in a key battle, the 'resurrections' of important characters, a 'crowning' moment - it's all been done before, and done better, by Peter Jackson. Even the effects were better in LotR - just compare some of the computerised animals to Gollum and you will see what I mean. Additionally, there's some blatant blue screening on more than one occasion.It's not that the battles are bad. They do have their effective moments, such as a memorable duel between Peter and the White Witch, but they sometimes border on tedium and confusion. And the film is not without its moments of unbearable cheese - just watch, for example, how some characters are 'resurrected'.Despite the best efforts of Andrew Adamson and his crew, the order of things in the fantasy world hasn't changed. The Chronicles Of Narnia have got off to a satisfactory start, but Harry Potter and The Lord Of The Rings are still - clearly - in front.Rating: 7/10",7,1,2,9 December 2005
The Girl Next Door," Sit back and enjoy this totally implausible but consistently likeable high school romp.
","Rating: *** (out of *****)What is Matthew (Emile Hirsch) supposed to do when, despite his academic achievements in high school, he hasn't got any special memories to write about for his closing statement in the yearbook? Sure, he's class president, but he's never done anything really interesting of note. (Hanging about with his two best friends doesn't count.) Of course, as in almost every film these days, a twist is necessary to get the plot going, and that twist is the arrival in Matt's neighbourhood of Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert). Matt is as struck by her looks as she is by his innocence.Some American critics have written about how The Girl Next Door seems like a 21st century Risky Business (an early '80's Tom Cruise flick). I can't make the comparison, but what I can do is state that yes, Matt does get involved in some very risky business, especially with Danielle's ex (Timothy Olyphant) and a host of others in her life.  Her life, in fact, is far more different from his than he could possibly imagine. (A hint to what her life is about can be found in the subject matter of the 1999 documentary with the same name as this film - although if you've read the previews, you probably know already.)A number of things elevate this from moderate fun to guilty pleasure. One of them is the presence of some really funny background gags - while some don't work, you have to give the director credit for trying them. At least twice, when you think the film could end, it continues and becomes better as a result. Best of all, Elisha Cuthbert, in whom I found nothing special in magazine pictures, looks absolutely stunning here, so to speak. The chemistry between her and the affable Emile Hirsch is believable. The young actors in the film are that likeable (and funny) that you forgive the lapses into corniness. It gets to the point where you really want a happy ending, and you get it.So what about the plot holes and the never truly credible story? This isn't art. It's pure entertainment, nothing more, nothing less, with a good choice of tunes too. My advice is just to sit back, relax and enjoy. You might just be pleasantly amused, whether you are in your teens or not.",Null,0,0,4 May 2004
Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man 2 improves on the original in many ways. Perhaps something is lacking, but, again, you'll be hooked.
","Rating: **** (out of *****)It appeared almost inevitable that Spider-Man 2 would go down as the ultimate summer blockbuster. The trailers made it seem so, as did the majority of reviews from America, some of which have labelled it the greatest superhero/comic book film ever made. Does Spider-Man 2 really live up to the hype?Well, in my eyes the answer is both yes and no. It lacks the constant energy of a Pirates of the Caribbean and the novelty of the first Spider-Man film. Yet that doesn't take anything away from the fact that it improves on the original in many ways.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is struggling desperately whilst leading his double life as a college student and Spider-Man. His best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco) still holds it against the web-slinger for the death of his father, and he can never tell Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) how he really feels about her, knowing the consequences it would bring.It's about to get worse. Not only does Mary Jane get engaged (knowing that she can't keep waiting for him) but a new villain emerges. An experiment carried out by scientist Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) goes horribly wrong, leaving him with four additional mechanical arms with minds of their own. As Dr. Octopus (or Doc Ock), who can tell how seriously he will affect both the city and Peter  who, not long after 'giving up' and deciding to lead a normal life, must suddenly don the suit again? There are obvious parallels to be found here with previous superhero sequels, such as Superman II and Batman Returns. (Think of Peter abandoning his alter-ego, for example.) More apparent rehashes are likely to be spotted in the opening credits sequence, and certain scenes that seem like leftovers from the original's cutting room floor. But they differ significantly enough from their original source to stand on their own very well.Spider-Man 2 is a deeper film than its predecessor, with more entertaining action sequences and a more mature cast. The star of the show, Tobey Maguire, is as solid as ever, although in parts you feel the rest of the cast is catching up with him. Like Kirsten Dunst and James Franco, for example, who have both grown into their roles  if Dunst is slightly less camera-friendly, this works to her advantage, as it makes her more believable. J.K. Simmons is back as J. Jonah Jameson, and this time he's even funnier. Even Rosemary Harris's Aunt May has a greater impact on the story. But the real standout is Alfred Molina, whose Doc Ock is very nearly on par with David Carradine's Bill as the most three-dimensional and sympathetic (if such a word can be used) screen villain of the past few years. The biggest coup the Spider-franchise has, though, is director Sam Raimi. His intentionally corny approach, coupled with his ability to keep focused on the story ahead of style (let's face it  the music and special effects are hardly earth-shattering) has made both this film and its predecessor uniquely entertaining. He even throws in some brilliant light-hearted touches, just like he did in the first film (There's a musical montage that is certain to make you chuckle, and at least two notable cameos). Let's hope him  and the cast  stay in place for at least one more film.However much I want to agree with the critics and fans who rate Spider-Man 2 as the greatest comic-book film ever made, I can't. Nonetheless this is still a marvel-lous (please excuse the pun) adaptation which also, thanks to a certain 'old friend', sets the stage nicely for Spider-Man 3.",Null,0,0,18 July 2004
Finding Nemo," Let's go swimming!
","Rating: **** (out of *****)If Pixar can continue to deliver the goods like they have done once more, with Finding Nemo, then we can be assured that the future of computer animation is in safe hands. Finding Nemo arrives here following massive success stateside, yet its success has, quite possibly, led to nit picking among some. Certain journalists (Toy Story purists, no doubt) have called it such things as 'formulaic' and 'strictly for kids'. Well, would you call Pixar as original if they approached all their films' storylines in the same way as Toy Story's?True, it is admittedly hard to expect anything to astound you as much as the film that signalled their arrival in the world of full-length animated motion pictures. But this film sits quite nicely among their other efforts. I'd put it on pretty much the same level as Monsters, Inc. and just ahead of Toy Story 2. Finding Nemo is more of a straightforward adventure tale than any other Pixar film (the title character's name could be a nod to Captain Nemo, of 20,000 Leagues under the Sea). Our setting is the Pacific Ocean, where Nemo, a young clown fish (voiced by Alexander Gould), is captured by some scuba divers. His father, Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) immediately begins searching for his son, but finding him will take much longer than he thought, as Nemo has ended up in the fish tank of an Australian dentist.
Along the way, Marlin hooks up (no pun intended) with a forgetful tang named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), and they both proceed to meet all kinds of colourful and interesting characters, including three sharks (one of whom is voiced by Barry Humphries) and a surfer turtle (voiced by the film's co-writer/director, Andrew Stanton). All the while, the other fish in the tank (including a butterfly fish named Gill, voiced by Willem Dafoe) are trying to help Nemo get out. From looking at the animation, I could see that Pixar have made some truly innovative strides forward with each of their films, at least on the technical side. Their typical `trademarks' are visible here, such as the main characters' wide eyes and the obviously artificial humans (the makers are obviously aware of how out of place Final Fantasy-style techniques would look here). But everything on view is smoother, more colourful, and significantly more detailed than any of their previous major efforts. This makes Finding Nemo more pleasing to the eye than Pixar's other films. The film's generally linear storyline prevents it from scaling (again, no pun intended) the heights of the original Toy Story. There aren't too many real surprises as such. But by no means have Pixar gone soft in the story department, despite what some believe. In fact, I could argue that this is probably the most consistently funny script they have come up with. It's not short on background gags either, examples being some product placement satire and a possible reference to Monty Python. You'll even find some nods to Pixar's past efforts (some more subtle than others  I'll let you look for them). Pixar have always struck gold on their vocal pairings for their leads (Tom Hanks & Tim Allen, John Goodman & Billy Crystal...) and they've found another fine pairing in Albert Brooks & Ellen DeGeneres. Both are natural comedians, and they help to make the film as clever and funny as it is. Even if DeGeneres sometimes becomes irritating, I think that's intentional. Listening to them and to all the other characters, we can see that Pixar are almost as good as casting their voices as animating their films.Anyway, I have said enough. Go and see Finding Nemo. You will not regret it. (And you'll get to see a wonderfully inventive short film from Pixar's past beforehand...)",Null,0,1,15 October 2003
Alexander," An epic failure
","Co-written and directed by: Oliver StoneStarring: Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer, Angelina Jolie, Jared Leto, Rosario Dawson, Anthony HopkinsLook, it's January, and it's time for the big studios to churn out their Oscar-baiting epics! What a great comeback it would be for Oliver Stone if Alexander, his take on the famous Macedonian conqueror, succeeded. Well, guess what. It doesn't. Worse than that, it's the worst film I've seen in a long time.Deja vu. Those were among the first words that entered my head when I began to formulate my opinion of this film. Of course, it might just be historically inaccurate, but what do audiences care? Don't we simply go to epics to enjoy an impressive diversion, rather than to learn about history? The problem with Alexander is that it fails as even that. It may have fine costumes, great make-up, sumptuous sets, heroic speeches and some gigantic battles, but those have all been prepared better in the likes of The Lord Of The Rings, Braveheart, Gladiator and even The Last Samurai. Considering the potential that this story has, we really shouldn't settle for what comes our way here.OK, let me bring you up to speed. Alexander attempts to chart certain aspects of the life and times of Alexander the Great (played as an adult by Colin Farrell) during its three-hour length. The film primarily focuses on his relationships with his parents (Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer) closest friend (Jared Leto) and first wife, Roxane (Rosario Dawson).It also attempts to focus on his conquests and tries to show us what persuaded him to have such a constant drive for success, but it is ultimately unsuccessful in doing so. The most obvious reason for this is that large parts of the film are just boring - there is no life or meaning in the massive lines of expository dialogue that are thrown at us.Stone is apparently renowned for his gigantic ego, and, sure enough, the film is overlong and narcissistic. In fairness to Stone, the film will alert people to an interesting historical moment, and he never really spares us from the horrors of war in his bloody battles. Yet how is the latter an advantage if the battles are tedious and incoherent? The Lord Of The Rings' battles might have been labelled as sanitised by some naysayers, but at least they were gripping.I should also mention that Alexander (the character, that is) harbours potentially homoerotic tendencies. If you really want to see this film, then you may find yourself wondering afterwards why he really married Roxane and two other wives. That question is never fully answered, and putting such an issue aside reduces poor Rosario Dawson to the status of plot device. She isn't the only one - talented actors like Brian Blessed and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers are mere window dressing, and Anthony Hopkins is asked to do little more than tell the story in voice-over. (What a cliché.) Thus Stone has left the film in the hands of Colin Farrell and Angelina Jolie, with Val Kilmer doing his best. What a terrible mistake. Farrell may have a knack for convincing in supporting roles (see Minority Report and Intermission) but if Alexander's anything to go by, he cannot carry a big Hollywood movie. Maybe it's the script, but not for one second did I believe his Alexander was a great leader. Still, at least he doesn't embarrass himself as much as Angelina Jolie. (What accent was she using again? Come to think of it, what accent were the actors supposed to use in general?) At least the likes of Blade: Trinity don't demand three hours of your time. I don't know about you, but Alexander has very nearly done enough to keep me from seeing another Oliver Stone film for life.Rating: * (out of *****)",3,3,6,9 January 2005
Troy," Overlong, overstretched, over-hyped  yet Troy is somehow still entertaining.
","Rating: *** (out of *****)On my way to writing this review, I was about to state that Brad Pitt is Troy's 'Achilles' heel (boom, boom!) before I realised on reflection that he isn't really that bad as the Homeric warrior. His performance is actually quite typical of the film he stars in  when it's good, it's very good, but when it's not so good, it really drags. With a director like Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, In the Line of Fire) at the helm, perhaps we should've expected a little better.That being said, Petersen has got most of his priorities right with this epic version of Homer's Iliad. The atmosphere and sets, for example, get few complaints from me, even though the Trojan capital, for me anyway, is unfortunately a little reminiscent of a set from The Return of the King. (That's not the only thing that will remind you of the Lord of the Rings in this film  two LotR alumni, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean, have major roles.)More on what the film does right and wrong later  I realise that I should bring you all up to speed with the story. (Homeric scholars, be warned  the original story's time period is shortened rather drastically.) Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), brother of the Greek conqueror Agamemnon (Brian Cox), loses his wife Helen (Diane Kruger) after she is persuaded away by the infatuation of Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom). As Paris's brother, Hector (Eric Bana) is only too aware, this damages an already uneasy alliance with the Greeks and thus war is declared on Troy. Aided by the warrior Achilles, the Greeks appear to have the upper hand.But whose side are we on? That's a good question. In Troy, there's really no side we really feel like rooting for, as such. What we are actually doing is watching a legend unfold, even if it is not unfolding as well as it could have done.As I've already stated, I have few arguments against the sets & atmosphere, and the same is true regarding the casting. Of special notice are Eric Bana, Peter O'Toole, Brian Cox, Sean Bean and Rose Byrne. Pitt, Orlando Bloom and Diane Kruger aren't as successful. I probably would have rated Bloom higher had Paris come across as less of a wuss. And yes, shades of Legolas resurface. To be fair to Bloom, I see all of this as more the fault of the writer. As for Kruger, I don't doubt that she's pretty, but she's just not radiant enough. On this evidence, the German newcomer is (I hate to say it) wooden. But again, I'll be fair. The script gives her terribly little to do.Petersen and his crew don't handle certain sequences very well either. Poor editing in the battles renders them nearly insignificant in comparison to the one-on-one combat fights. (The one between Hector and Achilles is especially memorable.) The occasional bad dialogue is too easy to notice, and James Horner surely could have been a little more restrained with his score during the death scenes.With less superfluous material, greater emphasis on Paris & Helen's development as a couple and a more consistent showing from Pitt, Troy could have been something really special. In the end it's no more than a solid summer epic. If that's all you want from it, you won't be disappointed  just don't expect it to live up to the hype.",Null,1,2,25 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Don't worry too much about the message in Emmerich's latest - just enjoy.
","Rating: *** (out of *****)Earth is under attack - from its own climate. Excessive global warming is set to bring about the next Ice Age, something that scientist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) suspects long before anyone else. Of course (as is often the case in Hollywood disaster films) few heed his warnings, and, sooner than expected, tornadoes and floods are destroying the major cities in the north of America. Hall has the additional worry of trying to rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who happens to be in New York when the disaster occurs.As if Independence Day wasn't enough, Roland Emmerich now wants destruction on a new, more realistic (hang on, did I just say 'realistic'?) level. Funnily enough, he succeeds. If you liked ID4, you'll definitely like this.I think it's best to compare The Day After Tomorrow with ID4. The similarities are there, alright: there's the Big Presidential Speech, the 'important' characters who don't believe our heroes when they should, and 'touching' subplots involving kids. Then again, 'It's the End of the World as we Know It' is nowhere to be heard. But at the end of this, you'll definitely feel fine.To be fair to Emmerich, he does touch on a clear warning about global warming. Yet despite his attempt to convey a serious message, you can never picture him outside the popcorn genre. And in every possible way, this is a Roland Emmerich film. But it succeeds better than his other disaster efforts, though, the reasons being less characters (just look at ID4's bloated cast for comparison), greater emotional restraint and a more frightening premise. I'm not even going to analyse the special effects, because you'll know how good they are from either the trailers or the standard Emmerich set in his previous disaster films.It helps that he has chosen solid actors like Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ian Holm and relative newcomer Emmy Rossum. (I could've sworn I saw a young Norah Jones when I looked at her - interestingly, we'll see how she fares as a singer when the film version of The Phantom of the Opera is released in the near future.)Forget the factual errors, blatant conveniences, corny ending, bad dialogue, product placement overload and attempts at clever pseudo-science. The Day After Tomorrow is a genuinely thrilling popcorn film, even if it is unremarkable and shamelessly manipulative. One that's best enjoyed when you don't want to think.",Null,0,1,1 July 2004
Hotel Rwanda," An easily accessible and very valuable history lesson
","Co-written and directed by: Terry GeorgeStarring: Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix, Nick Nolte, Cara Seymour First things first; Hotel Rwanda is an excellent film, possibly my favourite of the last twelve months. Terry George's film successfully places an uplifting story of survival in the midst of a real-life disaster, rarely slipping into melodrama. It is content to tell its tale in an understated and unpretentious manner.The disaster in question is the Rwandan genocide of 1994. In the space of three months, one million people were murdered in Rwanda - and frighteningly enough, not many people around the world seemed to notice. Most of these people were the Rwandan Tutsi's, murdered by the Rwandan Hutu's. The Hutu's described the Tutsi's as 'cockroaches', 'traitors' and 'invaders' who 'stole our land'.While all this went on, a Hutu hotel manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) campaigned to save as many Hutu's and Tutsi's as he possibly could. He felt especially close to the Tutsi's, his wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), being one herself. And so his hotel effectively became a camp for refugees. But he knew that it couldn't stay that way forever.Certain film intellectuals slam these 'manipulative' films for making us 'feel good about feeling bad', and not teaching us anything new. Others will certainly give Hotel Rwanda a hammering for focusing too much on the survivors and not enough on the victims. I seem to recall some people stating similar things about Schindler's List and The Pianist, two critically-acclaimed historical dramas.In my opinion, these writers are way off the mark. Detractors must remember that the aim of both Hotel Rwanda and Schindler's List is not to be the definitive film of the Rwandan genocide or the Holocaust, respectively. They are not documentaries either. Rather, they are stories about how one man made a difference during a horrific tragedy. They never let you forget the seriousness of these situations, aiming to show you how you can find hope and optimism in those times - and they both do so brilliantly.It's questionable, however, how much of an impact such films can have Â– after all, as one character states at one point during the film: 'After they see this, people are gonna say 'My God, That's terrible' and then go on eating their dinners'. But if film-makers like Terry George and Steven Spielberg believe they can make a difference, then why shouldn't they try? Mainstream audiences should be reminded of events like the Rwandan genocide, and it's to George's credit that he presents the situation in such an effective manner.A hero such as Paul Rusesabagina did exist, so why deny him the compelling story that he deserves, based on the evidence before us? No two-hour film could possibly do justice to the Rwandan genocide, and George understands that. So rather than constantly bombard us with exploitative, over-the-top footage of people dying, he instead focuses on Paul's story, which is the right thing to do. George doesn't take sides either - the film might be seen by some as a battle between 'good' Tutsi's and 'bad' Hutu's, but not for one moment is the film as simplistic as that. That we sympathise with the Tutsi 'cockroaches' is largely down to the treatment that they are receiving.I've known that Don Cheadle was a gifted performer for a while, but to anyone who only remembers him from Ocean's Eleven, the strength of this performance may come as a real shock. The film lies almost squarely on his shoulders, and while his role is largely an underplayed one, it does call for him to be emotive numerous times, and he is up to the task. His Oscar nomination was merited, as was Sophie Okonedo's. We find Tatiana both sympathetic and believable despite the fact that she doesn't figure as prominently. Cara Seymour's Red Cross worker also stands out (in fact, she features heavily in two of the most moving scenes in the film). With the exception of Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte, the rest of the cast is largely unknown, but no less effective.Hotel Rwanda would have been a worthy Oscar winner, and is, without doubt, an easily accessible and very valuable history lesson.Rating: ***** (out of *****)",Null,1,1,4 March 2005
Ocean's Twelve," Smug
","Directed by: Steven Soderbergh Starring: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Don Cheadle, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Shaobo Qin, Eddie Jemison, Bernie Mac, Vincent Cassel Smug. No other word can come to mind when watching Ocean's Twelve, Steven Soderbergh's latest step down the ladder of respectability.When he brilliantly re-made the 1960 Rat Pack flick Ocean's Eleven for the New Millennium Audience, critics thought he was just taking time off. Yet films like these seem to be his bread and butter these days. Why else would he even contemplate making a sequel? Perhaps he might have been better off not going mainstream after all. Since Out Of Sight, his standard has gradually fallen. (I was one of those not overly impressed by Traffic.) Well, in fairness to him, you could do worse. I can't think of many other directors who could get such a cast together for a popcorn film, and then photograph them so well, before proceeding to waste them. Sure, they might be having fun (perhaps too much fun), but you know they could be doing better. That wasn't really a problem in Ocean's Eleven, because the audience were enjoying themselves too. This time, though, the audience appears to have been left out of the 'fun', so to speak.During the opening 20 minutes, Ocean's Twelve looks like it might just be the rarity of a sequel that bests the original. Casino boss Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) is set out on taking revenge against Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his band of eleven after their successful heist in the first film. When Benedict tracks them down, he quickly lays down his orders: pay back what you stole, plus interest, in two weeks.Sounds like the set-up for a worthwhile sequel, doesn't it? Well, it gets more ambitious. The gang decide to jet off to Europe to find the money, but soon, they become tracked by sexy Europol agent Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones). And this, my friends, is where the heists - and the problems - begin.Screenwriter George Nolfi tries to impress us with dialogue that isn't really that impressive. The heist subplots twist and turn so much that they aren't worth caring about. A character illogically switches to the good side. Two admittedly innovative scenes nearly come off, but end up feeling self-indulgent.While all this is going on, the cast (and the director, you sense) seem to be smirking throughout. (The biggest offender of the lot would have to be Vincent Cassel, who makes his supposedly important character irritating.) All in all, it's reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino at his absolute worst. Even David Holmes is in below par form as he produces a rather forgettable score.In a way, watching Ocean's Twelve is like watching a dozen Jose Mourinhos. But at least that man has a good reason to be pleased with himself.Rating: ** (out of *****)",5,0,0,9 February 2005
Lost in Translation," Translated perfectly
","Rating: ***** (out of *****)I'm undoubtedly with the majority in declaring Lost in Translation to be one of the best films of the year. Yet I believe that I should point out a few things to viewers beforehand. Lost in Translation is NOT 100% uplifting, melodramatic or remotely formulaic. But Lost in Translation IS melodic, atmospheric, comedic, dark, sometimes depressing, and realistic. Above all, Lost in Translation is a thoroughly successful character study. I credit the Academy for nominating daring material like this for Best Picture.
You might not be totally sure what to think of the film the moment you finish seeing it. However, a little thought afterwards will make it clear that the film does indeed have several 'hidden depths' - which will make the film worth seeing at least a second time. The atmosphere, characters and philosophising - in fact, everything - seems so real. It's no wonder many critics have loved this film.I was reminded of several very good/excellent films when watching this. Lost In Translation is as quirky as any film in the mould of Being John Malkovich mould. Scarlett Johansson's character, Charlotte, sometimes dropped some wit that could have come from the mouth of Ghost World's Rebecca. It shares many of the strengths of Donnie Darko, but unlike that film, never slips into excessive weirdness. And, for about half its running length at least, it is as dark and unconventional as fare such as Dirty Pretty Things (which I admit I may have underrated). You can even see it as a satire on film and television, if you choose.Bob Harris (Bill Murray), an actor now past his best, has gone out to advertise whisky in Tokyo. He's rather worn down by the constraints of family life. It so happens that a young lady named Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is also in Tokyo, with her photographer husband John (Giovanni Ribisi). As John is constantly at work throughout the day, this leaves Charlotte bored. A chance meeting between Bob and Charlotte leads to eventual bonding, but what next? Lost in Translation can act as an alternative option for those who don't want to visit Middle Earth again, or for those looking for an antidote to the over-sentimental love stories found in films such as Love Actually. A warning, though; Lost in Translation requires your constant attention. And during the slower parts, some people may find that difficult. But they won't regret it in the long term.Not one bit of film is wasted. Credit here must go to both writer/director Sofia Coppola (making only her second film after The Virgin Suicides) and cinematographer Lance Acord (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation), whose shots of Tokyo are especially stunning. The camerawork and music are as helpful at setting moods as the dialogue is.I actually think that the Coens' Intolerable Cruelty could have attained this standard had it taken more risks and included less slapstick humour. Every time you expect Coppola to go for too easy laughs, she resists (with one exception, perhaps, but the payoff's so good you don't care).
The hype suggests that Bill Murray is at his best ever in this film, and while I can't make that claim (I haven't seen all his films) I can say that I have never seen him submerge himself in character like he does here, not even in Groundhog Day. We do see his fun side, of course, but those who have only seen his comedies may be a little surprised. Johansson, meanwhile, not only looks incredible but more than equals the level of Murray's performance (why was she ignored at the Oscars?). I should also mention Anna Faris (best known for the Scary Movies), who, as a blonde bimbo, is better than you would expect her to be.What's most striking about Lost in Translation is that Hollywood influence is almost undetectable (and yes, this is a very good thing). There is no doubt that with this film, Coppola has taken what she learnt from The Virgin Suicides and moved to the next level. Whether you end up loving Lost in Translation or not, it will leave its mark on you.",Null,0,1,30 January 2004
Corpse Bride," The ghost of Jack Skellington hangs over this
","Am I the only one who's beginning to think that even though Tim Burton is still churning out solid entertainment, his magic touch deserted him ages ago.To be honest, I don't think he's been involved in a really spectacular film for over a decade. And this 'really spectacular film' comes to mind when watching his latest, Corpse Bride. Because both that film and his latest are stop-motion animations.Yes, I'm talking about The Nightmare Before Christmas, that near masterwork which had some remarkable elements, including a wickedly original sense of humour, interesting characters, a well-played romance, and songs that weren't brilliant but grew on you.Barring the songs (which are unmemorable and difficult to make out) Corpse Bride has got all of those. But the storyline is less coherent. That, and the film seems more trite and sentimental. Is this because we're getting a little too used to Tim Burton's style of film-making? Or is he just becoming too methodical? Victor (Johnny Depp) is getting cold feet before his arranged marriage to Victoria (Emily Watson). Somehow, he can't even remember the vows before the big day. So he goes for a wander in the nearby forest, where he can rehearse and hopefully put things right. But just as everything seems to come together for him, a venture into the forest unearths the sinister Corpse Bride, Emily (Helena Bonham Carter).The story is told competently enough to keep you involved, and the animation is superb. At least Burton's visual gift hasn't been diminished; the production design and the faces of some of Corpse Bride's characters, especially the title character, prove that. These stop-motion figurines are voiced by a wide array of talent. Although truthfully, that means little these days; Charlie And The Chocolate Factory's gifted cast couldn't lift it above the mediocre. Fortunately, Corpse Bride is certainly more than 'mediocre'; it's guaranteed satisfaction on all levels.My problem with it is that I was personally looking for more than just mere 'satisfaction.' Perhaps I'm drawing too many comparisons to The Nightmare Before Christmas? I know this review may sound negative to you, but don't get me wrong. I did like Corpse Bride and I think you will enjoy it. I just expected more. Now, if only Burton could truly rediscover his magic touch once and for all...Rating: 7/10",7,1,2,30 October 2005
The Italian Job," Job well done
","Rating: *** (out of *****)1969's The Italian Job has earned a massive cult following among many. It's a film I hold quite a high opinion of (although personally I don't see it as a real classic), so my initial reaction to this supposed remake was that it was a `bad idea'.So I guess we should be grateful that director F. Gary Gray and his talented cast have decided against religiously remaking the original. Rather, they have just borrowed the title, the minis and the basic `heist' premise. And maybe some other little details as well, if you care to look for them (such as Donald Sutherland's character sharing the same surname as Noel Coward's - but that's all the two characters really have in common). The mafia involvement and humour have been replaced by family & revenge issues, plus a few more surprises. Oh, and memorable musical numbers are pushed aside in favour of a typical modern soundtrack. As was the case in the original, a gang of thieves have a `job' to do, although the main job takes place in America, not Italy. This gang consists of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg reprising the role originated by Michael Caine), Lyle (Seth Green), John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), Half Ear (rapper Mos Def) and Steve (Ed Norton). After a successful gold grabbing heist in Venice, the gang meet to discuss what they'll do with this money. Unfortunately, Steve has ideas of his own and suddenly turns on the gang, killing Bridger and taking the gold for himself. The rest of the gang somehow escape his clutches and set out to regain the gold with the services of Bridger's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron).In some ways this is a more ambitious film than the original, but that isn't necessarily a plus point. The Italian heist is a little bit dull and confusing, but the majority of the American heist (the true centrepiece of the film) provides thrills aplenty, including the most memorable car chase of recent years. Like the original, several coloured minis are involved, but the pacing is upped to another level altogether.Perhaps, however, the script was written too lightly. There are some true surprises, but also many plot holes. We are thankfully spared a heavy-handed love subplot (which you nearly feel you can see coming from a mile away). Unfortunately we are not spared some trite character building scenes, but the actors do manage to make them work. A more serious issue, in my opinion anyway, is that the sound quality isn't the best. In the early stages, the average filmgoer may find it difficult to keep track of what is going on, and may just decide to go with the flow. Come to think of it, `going with the flow' might be the best idea, as the part of the film where the main plan is explained very nearly falls flat.Up against Michael Caine, Mark Wahlberg does look rather inferior. Yet it must be stated that he isn't trying to follow the example of the famous British actor, and, for what it's worth, he does an above adequate job. Everyone else slides easily enough into their parts, and Charlize Theron has rarely looked better as a smart safe-cracker. Much of the original's subtlety and humour has been lost at the expense of modernising the film. I wonder if this film would have been more successful had the tone been less politically correct. It sometimes feels like this version was deliberately dumbed down for teenagers. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, and luckily the 2003 Italian Job doesn't cross the line into stupidity. In fact, there are quite a few smart lines, and viewers will generally feel comfortable and involved while watching, even if the majority of this involvement is relegated to the film's second half. The action in general is handled pretty well, building up to a rewarding climax (albeit one with an overused plot device for an epilogue). The new Italian Job is a satisfying enough package, even if it is full of holes. Just don't be comparing it too much to the original, because  as I stated earlier  it's not an actual remake.",Null,0,1,10 October 2003
Cold Mountain," It didn't leave me cold
","Rating: **** (out of *****)Inman (Jude Law) goes off to battle in the American Civil War, leaving his newly found love, Ada (Nicole Kidman) behind in the small community of Cold Mountain, North Carolina. During the severity of battle, in 1864, Inman becomes a deserter and sets out to return to Cold Mountain. The story (based on the novel by Charles Frazier) follows his dangerous journey home as him and other deserters are tracked by cavalry led by Teague (Ray Winstone). It also follows Ada as she takes care of the farm that belonged to her late father (Donald Sutherland). She finds aid and friendship in the form of the spirited Ruby (Renée Zellweger).As I watched the unclear opening moments of this road epic/romance, I remember thinking that Cold Mountain was going to be a 'waste of time' as well as 'obvious Oscar bait with two over-hyped actors as the romantic leads'. Well, it's nice to be proved completely wrong in one respect, as the film makes a marvellous recovery to provide over two hours of worthwhile, if frustratingly inconsistent entertainment. These days, there's always at least one Miramax film that will be heavily promoted during awards season, and Cold Mountain is one of them. Just look at the talent involved. Anthony Minghella (The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley) has adapted and directed this. Also, the film's supporting cast contains impressive actors such as Ray Winstone, Donald Sutherland, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Natalie Portman. Even The White Stripes' Jack White gets a good performance coaxed out of him.Then there's the film's soundtrack, which, as well as being a little melodramatic, had some elements that could have been lifted from O Brother, Where Art Thou?. Cold Mountain, however, isn't as funny, compelling or memorable as the Coen brothers picture. Yet it does have the significant advantage of more realistic characters. And the film needs that advantage.I'm not a fan of either Nicole Kidman or Jude Law, but they both hold their own here, and they have enough chemistry for a good romance (if not a great one). Both Kidman and Renée Zellweger better their rather overrated performances in The Hours & Chicago, respectively, by some distance, especially Zellweger. Alas, all three leads run into a little trouble with the accents. Zellweger's is sometimes grating, and even Kidman & Law struggle in that department near the beginning.Like another certain Oscar contender, The Last Samurai, Cold Mountain is hampered by its inconsistency and length (although the Cruise film got away with it a little better). This is probably the result of some pretentiousness on the director's part. But, just like The Last Samurai, I recommend this.",Null,0,0,21 January 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," They're back
","Rating: *** (out of *****)Yes, they're back. The franchise that produced two excellent instalments in the late 20th century has returned. I had high hopes for Terminator 3 before I entered the cinema, mainly because of good reviews, a good trailer and enjoyment of the first two films in the series (which many hold anyway).The build-up is momentous as we begin in the present day with John Connor (now played by In the Bedroom's Nick Stahl) narrating about the current state of affairs. His account reveals that despite the ending of Terminator 2, in which all of us believed that Sarah Connor had prevented judgement day (she hasn't, as we soon discover), he fears for the future and lives with no one knowing who he is or where he comes from. These fears are realised when Skynet sends the T-X (Kristanna Loken), a seemingly unstoppable terminator in female guise, back in time to eliminate him and all his future lieutenants, which include vet Kate Brewster (an underused Claire Danes). Fortunately, John has protection as well, in the form of the now obsolete T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger). When a story like this begins unfolding, beginning with a rather fine chase scene, you feel that you're in for something special. And indeed, the elements for a very good film are all in place. For example, the actors, even Arnold, are at their best. Yes, the big man is exceptionally good as the now obsolete T-101. Every one of his lines is either funny or convincing. Kristanna Loken, despite having very few lines, gets her job done effectively, intentionally imitating Robert Patrick at times (I say `intentionally' for the T-X can be seen as an enhanced T-1000 with an endoskeleton and a few more interesting enhancements).
The plot's generally thin, but when it does get theoretical, it's generally convincing. Director Jonathan Mostow may not be James Cameron, but he definitely knows how to update the Terminator for the new millennium. Some of T3's action scenes are real stand outs in this year's crowd of summer films, and there are some major new plot developments. But it's here where the film begins to fall a bit flat. These new plot developments are touched on but left unexplored. There are several plot holes and the time shifts are inconsistent. And while there's no doubt that a lot of care was put into the opening chase, the final scenes seemed to be resolved far too easily. The first two Terminator films had open endings that could be conclusions as well as leave room for possible sequels. This one appears to be almost entirely dependent on a T4 (and box office returns seem to have ensured that, but...), especially as the film ends a little too abruptly. If T3 had a little more substance then I could definitely have recommended it to everyone. Still, T3 still offers a good time at the movies in its own right, even if it isn't the perfect summer blockbuster (if you're looking for that, try Pirates of the Caribbean).",Null,0,0,6 September 2003
"I, Robot"," I, Robot does make you think. Yet such thoughts are superficial in what is, at its heart, a mostly mindless action film.
","Rating: *** (out of *****)1. A robot may not harm a human or, by inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.  Isaac Asimov's three laws of roboticsIt is certainly not possible for robots to violate the above three laws, especially in 2035, where robots that look a little bit like C-3POs perform many of the day-to-day jobs of humans. Or is it? Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) certainly doubts it, as he believes that one of these robots may have been responsible for the death of Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), thus 'breaking the rules'. No one shares his belief until one of the robots, known only as Sonny (Alan Tudyk) is spotted behaving rather unusually. With the aid of Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), Spooner sets out to get to the bottom of a situation that could be something more serious.I, Robot, based very loosely on the series of short stories by Isaac Asimov, can be thought of as the first of the Minority Report wannabes that falls a little short of its goal. Not that Spielberg's film was perfect  it didn't totally realize its potential and it had its share of contrivances  but it made you think whilst simultaneously entertaining on many levels. I, Robot focuses far more on pumping the adrenaline, with only a few issues bubbling on the surface. The really important issues, like the rise in unemployment due to the creation of the robots, are sidestepped in favour of more generic ones like technology obeying its own rules. Even then, such issues are only brushed on, for director Alex Proyas doesn't want the message getting in the way of our popcorn at the end of the day. And all credit to Proyas here, for he certainly had me entertained when it came to the action. Some of the set pieces, including the denouement and a car chase in a tunnel, were very memorable, although it's needless to say that Proyas was not short on 'Vorsprung Durch Technik' for the film's top action set-piece, in more ways than one. Like Spielberg, Kubrick and Ridley Scott before him, Proyas uses brand names to make his setting familiar to us. But whereas Spielberg and Kubrick had alternate (and legitimate) uses for their names, having the likes of JVC and Converse rammed down our throats in the opening scenes of I, Robot is more of an irritation. (The cheap Converse gag really will make you cringe.) Proyas's 2035, while quite pleasing to the eye, comes across as inconsistent and derivative. I expected more from him, especially after hearing about the acclaim that he had received for his vision in Dark City.In truth, I, Robot seems pretty derivative in general. Of course, it is possible to create a slick pastiche, but Proyas is neither Tarantino nor Spielberg. His characters are mildly interesting, but nothing more. They haven't much heart, and thus don't demand much from the actors. Sometimes Will Smith is really good, and on other occasions seems to be on autopilot, just replaying his typical screen personality. It doesn't help that a few of his one-liners feel jarringly out-of-place. The way Bridget Moynahan delivers her lines in front of Sonny makes you wonder whose character is more robotic, although, to be fair, her Susan becomes slightly more human as the film goes on. It's somehow ironic that the one actor who will leave this film with his reputation enhanced  Alan Tudyk  is playing a robot. He lends Sonny a respectable element of realistic humanity, without tempting sentimentality like A.I.'s David.I, Robot is not a failure at all. In fact, it's a very watchable little package, salvaged by its entertaining action scenes and an interesting premise. One that could have been used for a really thoughtful combination of drama and action. But no, the filmmakers chose to go for all-out modern action, Matrix-style, with a bit of Robocop, The Terminator, A.I. and another aforementioned sci-fi film thrown in.

","Rating: **** (out of *****)Michael Mann, director of notable fare such as The Last Of The Mohicans and The Insider, has made probably the most daring casting move of the summer in his latest thriller  Tom Cruise, villain.Well, maybe not. It's true that Cruise is best known for playing heroes (like a cop on the run, a secret agent and an army captain-turned-samurai, to name but a few) but he has played bad guys before. (Remember the vampire Lestat?) But let's cut to the point, which is: how well does he fare as a gruff contract killer named Vincent? The answer is very well. He barely smiles, and there's no Last Samurai-esque pandering to his ego. His line delivery and screen presence is top-notch, and his unflappability may surprise even his sternest detractors. I really don't think that his namesake, Hanks, could ever play this kind of role. Sure, Vincent does get a little back-story, but it's hardly likely to make the audience feel sympathetic towards him.Vincent is sent out to kill five witnesses to a drug trafficking incident in modern LA. He successfully hijacks the services of a well-meaning cab driver, Max (Jamie Foxx) to drive him to these people, and in the process, Max finds out more about Vincent's world than he really wants to. And all along, he's forced to be Vincent's reluctant accomplice!Mann is an unsubtle director, which suits a leading man like Cruise down to the ground, but he is also a stylish one. With the help of both his camera and his actors, he draws the maximum possible suspense from nearly all of his action scenes. But the film scores highest when it is focused on Max and Vincent in the cab, as it is there where we hear the best of the smart, Tarantino-esque dialogue. The presence of black humour is a welcome relief from the concentration that this film requires to get the most from it.Mann has also worked well to bring the best out of Jamie Foxx. When Max first meets Vincent, he is nothing more than a puzzled bystander, but Vincent's continuing presence and actions change Max significantly, and Foxx is adept at showing these changes. However, this doesn't happen to the point where he becomes a completely different person, because his basic characteristics are still there. The 'heroic' transformation here is slightly untypical, and I credit Mann for this.Collateral has its flaws. I could have done with a little less exposition  the film loses its grip on the audience a bit in the middle. Some of the supporting cast members (especially Jada Pinkett Smith) are underused. And in the film's action-packed conclusion, the contrivances become more visible. There is also a potential problem at the beginning, where Cruise's presence threatens to render Foxx almost insignificant to the point where we are in danger of rooting for Vincent, not Max  however, the more ruthless Vincent becomes, the more we hate him, and this helps Foxx and the rest of the cast. Our sympathies gradually swing the right way throughout the film, and we leave the cinema completely satisfied.Collateral is a highly entertaining thriller that should stand up well on repeat viewings. It's also a film that shows that, once again, Tom Cruise is willing to try and stretch his range  even though he'll never quite reach greatness.",Null,0,0,20 September 2004
Batman Begins," Batman Begins...just as we wanted it to
","Co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan Starring Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Ken Watanabe, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Morgan Freeman I can now understand what David Goyer has been saving his energy for. After the calamitous mistake that was Blade: Trinity, he has teamed up with Memento helmsman Christopher Nolan to try and bring us the definitive tale of Batman's origins. Probably even the definitive Batman collection. And if the latter is the case, then it has got off to a very promising start.We begin with a young Bruce Wayne watching his parents' murder in an alleyway. His quest for vengeance eventually lands him in a Far East prison, where Bruce (now played by Christian Bale) is rescued and recruited in the art of self-defense by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson). He then makes the decision to return to a decaying Gotham City (even more so than the one Tim Burton envisioned), and finds his beloved family business, Wayne Enterprises, now under the corrupt corporate control of Earle (Rutger Hauer). This helps spur him on to create his famous crime-fighting alter-ego, with the help of family friend Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman).This re-imagination of Batman appears to be taking its cues from several previous comic book adventures. It combines the fun of Spider-Man, the dark style of Tim Burton's Batman movies, the intelligence of X-Men and the tragic elements of The Hulk. However, The Hulk played itself so straight that it failed to grasp the enjoyment factor so crucial to comic book films. Nolan doesn't make the same mistake as Ang Lee did, carefully sprinkling humour throughout and generally investing the right amount of time on characters. Where the Spider-Man and X-Men films lacked depth and ambition, Batman Begins is certainly not found wanting in those areas. It takes a gifted director to juggle the best elements of all the aforementioned films and yet still make everything seem fresh. But Nolan has somehow done it.As a bonus, Batman Begins is not an overly violent film, as Sin City was. While it contains its share of gripping action sequences, the film never lets us forget the consequences of its characters' actions, on both sides of the coin. An aura of realism and gloom surrounds the whole picture. Again, credit goes to Nolan here.The villainous plot, set in motion by The Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) is silly (as with most comic book films), but is carried off with the right element of gusto and believability. There are a couple of things that let the film down a little, however; a couple of characters could have been better developed, and why was there so much quick-cutting in a key chase? But those are minor quibbles.Nolan seems aware that his script is not enough to carry the work, and so he has assembled an incredible cast. The top-billed names aren't just stars, they are genuinely gifted actors. Christian Bale had the most expectations on his shoulders before the film, but he brings out more depth in Bruce Wayne than any Batman in the Burton/Schumacher era. His is the most human and vulnerable, although the vulnerability almost flies out the window when he dons the Batsuit. (Speaking of which, fans, just wait until you see the gadgets...) As Bruce's childhood friend/love interest, Katie Holmes plays on the adorability factor that she's acquired from TV and previous movies. Liam Neeson, as always, is excellent, and in some ways acts against type here. Cillian Murphy and Gary Oldman also act against type, though Oldman is more successful than Murphy. While I never saw a terrorist lurking behind the glasses of Oldman's Lieutenant Gordon, it was slightly harder for me to accept the more 'everyman' Murphy as a bad-to-the-bone villain. Nevertheless, he just about pulls it off. Everyone else, including Ken Watanabe, Tom Wilkinson and Michael Caine, is solid, with Caine getting a chance to enjoy some fine moments, comedic or otherwise.At last, the Joel Schumacher abominations can be laid to rest and this franchise can start anew. There will probably be better, more serious films than this one in 2005, but it will take one heck of a comic book adaptation to top this one.Rating: 9/10",9,1,2,19 June 2005
The Incredibles," Almost Incredible
","Written and directed by: Brad BirdFeaturing the voices of: Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Lee, Wallace Shawn, Elizabeth Peña There was a time when superheroes were in vogue. In those days, you could count on the likes of Mr. Incredible (voice of Craig T. Nelson), Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) to get things right. But when the people they had saved became unhappy with their presence, they filed a lawsuit against them, forcing them to live normal family lives.15 years later, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, now known as Bob and Helen Parr, are married with three children, two of whom have definitely inherited Mum and Dad's powers. Boring old Bob is struggling to hold on to his day job, so when a call from a mysterious stranger (Elizabeth Peña) alerts him to the possibility of using his powers again, it is an opportunity he cannot pass up...Pixar's latest offering does almost everything right. The animation is wonderful without being show-offy, the voice casting is as good as, if not better than, ever before, and the story is incredibly enthralling and sometimes very funny. Nearly three years ago, I labeled Monsters, Inc. a mixture of 'drama, comedy and action which will please both kids and adults.' That is what all of the Pixar films have been, and The Incredibles fits that description perfectly. More of the same, perhaps, but as the saying goes, why change a winning formula?Yet, incredibly (no pun intended) enough, Pixar have deviated slightly from their more traditional formula involving the linear 'buddy story'. One could be forgiven for thinking that Quentin Tarantino was an inspiration here - The Incredibles might not squeeze the strongest emotional response from its audience, but it's one of the slickest pastiches I've seen recently.That's right, I used the word pastiche. Elements of Spy Kids, Thunderbirds, James Bond, Indiana Jones, X-Men, Superman and Spider-Man will all come to mind at some point or another when you watch this film. While the various homages are hardly subtle - indeed, it's worth wondering if certain cynics will view these homages as thefts - the film is enjoyable enough to stand on its own. The writer-director, Brad Bird (who was responsible for the sadly unappreciated The Iron Giant) recognises that the best superhero films are funny, human and kinetic. That's much more important than just flashes and bangs on their own, although rest assured, action fans, there are plenty of those. As a result, this is Pixar's most violent offering to date, explaining the PG certificate. Don't worry, though - Pixar are too clever to go all Bruckheimer on us. The only problem with all of this cartoon violence is that in the post-9/11 world, it might not be seen as appropriate for a family film. Thankfully, Bird knows better than to focus too heavily on it.The Incredibles works very well for what it is. It's not as wholly satisfying as Toy Story, or even as funny, poignant or universally acceptable as the likes of Monsters, Inc. or Finding Nemo. But it does maintain Pixar's usual high standard of animation, whilst simultaneously providing perfect family entertainment for all but the youngest kids - and it shows that the studio are willing to take themselves in new directions.Rating: **** (out of *****)",Null,0,1,3 December 2004
Wimbledon," The charm of the talented cast keeps this run of the mill Brit-com from turning lame.
","Rating: *** (out of *****)Richard Loncraine's Wimbledon falls into the same trap as Richard Curtis's Love Actually; that is, there are many things to dislike about it. Yet, as a whole, Love Actually left a positive impression on most of the general public when they left the cinema. The question is, will people feel the same way about Wimbledon? Probably, but in this case a little more tolerance of the film's soppier elements is advised. And that might not go down too well with the most cynical of viewers. So does this mean that Working Title Films have suddenly hit a stumbling block with their last two major Brit-coms? Well, no. Both of them are pleasing enough entertainments. They're just not up to the standards of some of their previous efforts. The happy ending isn't a problem - when you watch their best love films (which include Bridget Jones's Diary and Four Weddings And A Funeral), that's exactly what you want. The central problem is the love story itself. I credit Loncraine for taking the Working Title love formula and trying to apply it to something a little different, i.e. tennis, but in this context it seems abruptly handled as well as a little awkward. It's to the credit of the two talented leads, Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany, that this story manages to get off the ground and become a sufficient crowd-pleaser.The premise sounds just like you would expect it to. British tennis player Peter Colt (Paul Bettany), having fallen to the rank of 119 in the world, has decided that this year's Wimbledon championships will be his last. The turning point arrives when he meets the current rising star and 'bad girl' of women's tennis, Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) - and he not only falls in love with her but suddenly finds that he has the potential to win the tournament. Of course, there are obstacles along the way, such as Lizzie's overprotective father (Sam Neill), but surely he'll overcome those.Yeah, it's pretty run of the mill stuff, with quite a few implausibilities along the way. But Wimbledon isn't as much of a fantasy as you might think. After all, we've seen people like Lizzie and Peter on the court in real life (some have recalled Chris Evert and Jimmy Connors in the 1970's), and overachieving underdogs are coming to the fold more often these days, if not necessarily in tennis. (Remember Greece's victory at Euro 2004?) The tennis aspects of the story are actually handled very well, even if the games are CGI-enhanced. Dunst, Bettany and all the other actors playing tennis stars don't put a foot wrong here. We are further entertained by the presence of former players-turned-commentators, like John McEnroe and Chris Evert.Unfortunately, just about everyone in the supporting ensemble is wasted. Gifted character actors like Sam Neill and Bernard Hill have little to do as Lizzie and Peter's respective fathers. I think the problem here is the muddled plot, or lack of it - we are constantly rushed from scene to scene, hardly getting a chance to spend time with the players' families. Fortunately, there are still some real scene-stealers to be found, like Jon Favreau's agent. Enjoy Wimbledon for what it is - a rather thin film, but one that should cheer up its audience with its charm, goodwill, cast and music (although we didn't really need to hear 'This Year's Love' yet again, did we?). You may consider it the warm-up exercise for what should be Working Title's real high point this year - the return of Bridget Jones.",Null,0,0,27 September 2004
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Don't waste your time on this laughably bad zombie sequel.
","Rating: * (out of *****)The sequel to Resident Evil capitalises on the rebirth of the zombie genre that's been evident this year in the Dawn Of The Dead remake and Shaun Of The Dead. The difference is, this one's purely about blowing the creatures up, with the help of a special being.When I watched this film in the cinema, there was no need for the projectionist to show the end credits. Does that, alone, explain how laughably bad this film was?Well, truth be told, the film has its potentially redeeming facets. Both Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory look really fit (now there's a definite plus for teenage fanboys), and Mike Epps provides very rare comic relief. But these are hardly reasons to buy a cinema ticket for this.Everything in Resident Evil: Apocalypse has Hollywood written all over it. Look at the dodging of bullets and the jumping through windows that most modern films have been making fun of. If I knew for one second that the director and screenwriter weren't taking this seriously, I may have given it an extra star. But nearly all of the laughs I got from this were from laughing at the bad dialogue and the cartoonish violence. And before I forget, the bad guy's German. (Yeah, what's new?)It's fine for the plot to be contrived and make no sense. It's another to be having little or no fun when watching. At least I can claim to have enjoyed parts of the Tuxedo. I suppose that this may be some people's cup of tea, purely for Milla Jovovich and the violence, but in my opinion this is a brain-dead video game masquerading as a film. Not recommended.",Null,1,2,11 October 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Is this `Charlie's Angels' taken seriously?
","Rating: *** (out of *****)What next for Quentin Tarantino? After crafting two of the most talked about films of the 1990's in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and then trying his luck with an Elmore Leonard adaptation (Jackie Brown), what more can this man prove?  Well, why not move into the martial arts world?
His latest film, Kill Bill, tries to do just that. Unfortunately, I can't make a final judgement on how successful the whole film is as yet, for I am only reviewing part of it. By taking what appears to be a linear story, dividing it in two, and stretching out these two `volumes' into 1 hr 50 min. segments, Tarantino has regrettably bowed down to the money-grabbing demands of the distributor (although he  and they  claim otherwise). It's hard to watch this in the cinema without the unease that Miramax are ripping filmgoers off. A shorter running length with an intermission would have been far more appreciative.Putting Miramax's greed aside, Kill Bill Volume I succeeds  to a certain extent. The dialogue and characters that you know Tarantino for best take a back seat to the technical side of things. But his mark is certainly on the film, and, as our protagonist, Uma Thurman shows a kind of ruthless glare and authority that I once felt was beyond her reach. The film opens with our heroine, known as The Bride, facing up to a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. The squad has five members: O-Ren Ishii, aka Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu  a Charlie's Angel suddenly gone tough, eh?), Vernita Green, aka Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox), Budd, aka Sidewinder (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver, aka California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), and the infamous Bill (David Carradine) who we don't even see, yet. They all thought they had killed her in a wedding massacre  they were wrong. She recovers from a coma, then she begins her revenge.Kill Bill has a very Pulp Fiction-esque chapter-like structure, but the similarities end there. In some ways, this film is a straightforward, arty and sometimes overly pretentious hybrid of The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The first hour is really enjoyable. The development of O-Ren's character (with a nice bit of anime to help) sets the ball rolling for some very interesting moments. However, Tarantino allows some scenes in the second half of the film to drag on for too long. This serves little purpose except giving us the chance to gaze at admittedly beautiful scenery and choreography (the latter courtesy of the Matrix man, Yuen Wo-Ping).Comparisons with The Matrix Reloaded will be inevitable. Yet I must admit that at the end of Volume I, I didn't feel quite as cheated as I did when I first saw the end of Reloaded. This film does not end so abruptly, and we are clearer about the situation. There's a nice twist at the end, too (even if it feels too convenient). So it's not so much an unclear plot that annoys us as the fact that, in a matter of months, we will have to part with more money to see how it all turns out (for little reason).
You may find another clear similarity with Reloaded in the closing battle. If you take out the blood and gore, the fight would easily fit into place in that film. Indeed, watching The Bride survive the hardest of attacks makes you think she may be some kind of Superwoman. (Although I wonder if it was such a good idea to use flying effects in the final showdown, for they actually look a little out-of-place in a battle where most of the fighting is firmly on the ground.)It's good to see Tarantino having a go at this sort of film, even though if we see many more films like this, the genre really will become overexposed. Nonetheless, his fans will be kept more than satisfied, and the final twist should help ensure that many will look forward to Volume II.",Null,0,0,28 October 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Burton is his own worst enemy
","Numerous people, including Roald Dahl himself, felt that his highly regarded children's classic, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, was poorly treated in its first filmic interpretation. Mel Stuart's 1971 film (which went as far as being named after Willy Wonka) was indeed flawed and sometimes cringeworthy, yet it has numerous original and endearing moments that leave a lasting impression. Enough, in fact, to make it a cult classic.But that hasn't stopped the detractors complaining. So with so many remakes around these days, why not at least try and put things right? And who better to do so than Tim Burton, that strange and interesting director who has given us a handful of mini classics in the past? He understands Roald Dahl better than anyone else, or so it seems.Now, for the few of you who don't know, the story revolves around the enormous chocolate factory of the reclusive Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp). No one has seen him for years, and he has suddenly decided to invite five children - just five, and no more - to accompany him on a tour of the factory itself. Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore), despite his poor conditions, never stops hoping that he will be one of those five. But even he cannot imagine what surprises lie in store for him.Like The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy before it, everything seems set up for a wonderful modern film adaptation. There's so much acting talent (Johnny Depp, relative newcomer Freddie Highmore, Helena Bonham-Carter, Edward Fox, Noah Taylor, Christopher Lee), so much wonderful production design (courtesy of Alex McDowell, who did an equally impressive job for Minority Report) and numerous brilliant moments. And yet...and yet...it all feels so rehearsed. There's a lack of spontaneity, there's little feeling. As Shakespeare would put it, it's 'all sound and fury, signifying nothing.' Let me make it clear that I love the book. As a result, one of the things I personally found dissatisfying about Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was its tendency to leave out many of the book's classic early moments. Burton and screenwriter John August overcome this flaw by ignoring the earlier film and successfully re-imagining some of the best scenes in the book in their own right. Unfortunately, these scenes are all too literally replicated, so while fans of the book will be happy to see them, they lack inspiration and leave little to the imagination. Which, it should be said, was one of the key themes of the original story.I could also argue that the pre-chocolate factory section of the film is rather rushed. This is more costly than you'd expect, and it leaves us with a poorly written leading protagonist. Freddie Highmore does his best with Charlie, but there is little in the film that suggests he will become the truly deserving winner of the prize that Wonka has in store for his favourite child.The arrival of Johnny Depp enlivens things immensely. Twenty minutes inside the factory with this guy, and I thought 'He makes Gene Wilder look sane.' Unfortunately, Depp's fantastic performance is hampered by Burton's interference, in the form of childhood flashbacks for Wonka. These may be innovative, but they are distracting and forced. It's as if Burton felt he had to justified to give Wonka a personality, when really he should have let Depp do most of the work. (Pretty much in the same way Gore Verbinski did in Pirates Of The Caribbean.) Roald Dahl managed to find the correct balance of pathos and irreverence in Wonka; neither Mel Stuart nor Tim Burton have been able to do so. It's a shame.Of course, those who have come along just to see their favourite book faithfully and stylishly recreated, with a few twists here and there (and these include the way Burton has staged the Oompa Loompas' songs) won't be disappointed. It even appears, at one point, that he has given the film a remarkable ending; unfortunately, the film ends up closing with a poorly handled, overly moralistic sermon on 'family values', that is jarring in the context of the film.So there you have it. For all that Tim Burton does right with this film, he misses an opportunity. And thus we have another 'Hitchhiker's Guide' - enjoyable, but could and should have been much, much more.Rating: 6/10",Null,0,1,22 August 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Kaufman bends our minds yet again as Carrey and Winslet get brainwashed.
","Rating: **** (out of *****)Once again, Charlie Kaufman is taking us inside someone's brain. True, he has already done that in two of his most famous screenplays, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. Yet, incredibly, he has managed to make his latest situation feel inventive and fresh, and the result has been the usual critical praise...although in my opinion the film may be slightly overrated. To me, Kaufman has never been able to really hide his smugness in his screenplays. But under director Michel Gondry (best known to me for that innovative 'White Stripes in Lego' music video) he keeps this aspect of himself quieter than usual.The plot seems simple enough. Joel Barrish (Jim Carrey) meets Clementine (Kate Winslet, again convincingly hiding the fact that she's British), falls in love and has a long-term relationship with her. Once day, however, he finds that she has gone through a process to erase every memory of their relationship from her brain. Shocked, he consults the doctor behind this process (Tom Wilkinson) and decides to go through it himself, but while it is happening to him, he discovers that he doesn't really want her to leave his mind after all.If you think this makes the film sound a little simplistic, don't be fooled. I'm just not revealing very much. Like Being John Malkovich before it, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind plays mind games with its audience, twisting and turning the complex screenplay so much that it's easy to get lost. Stay in there, though, and you will really appreciate the experience. You'll also find some really good jokes.Yet you do feel that there could be something more to this film than there is. The one significant problem with Eternal Sunshine is the lack of real involvement with the characters. I wonder if this the result of Kaufman and Gondry concentrating too much on the story itself  they do a great job there, no doubt about it, but I think that the film needs just a little bit more character depth for me to call it excellent.That is no fault of the actors. In fact, this is an actors' film. Jim Carrey continues to show his strengths as a serious actor, and has a good chemistry with Kate Winslet. Even though Winslet is forced to act slightly out of character here  to put it bluntly, Clementine seems excessively eccentric  she does so admirably. The supporting cast, which includes Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood (now free from having to carry the One Ring) and Kirsten Dunst, play it deadpan throughout, which is essential to the success of the film.
I may have my reservations, but I'm still highly recommending this. Eternal Sunshine fits in nicely with the really good films that are surfacing during the spring and summer months to date.",Null,0,1,25 May 2004
The Last Samurai," Eastern promise
","Rating: **** (out of *****)Everyone knows that once in a while, an epic adventure will comes along to challenge for awards. The Last Samurai is the latest film of this kind, and even if (at just over 2 ½ hours) it's probably a little too long, it still offers at least more than two hours of compelling cinema (and is therefore one of my favourite films of the year).Like Braveheart and Gladiator, The Last Samurai is a period epic. Here, it's the late 19th century in America, where Tom Cruise steps into the shoes of an American Civil War veteran, Captain Nathan Algren. Looking for a new challenge, he teams up with his friend Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly) and his commander, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) to travel to Japan, where they will train soldiers to battle against a group of warriors who are being trained by the last true samurai, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). When Katsumoto captures Algren alive in an unexpected skirmish, he does not kill him. Instead, he holds him as a hostage in his village. Both men soon find themselves learning about one another, with Algren getting an especially strong insight into Samurai culture. The question is: what will happen when the time comes to face his fellow Americans again?The themes of love, trust, honour, heroism and adjustment are nothing new in epics. But director Edward Zwick (whose resume includes war epics Glory and Courage Under Fire) touches on these themes without being heavy handed. Even the scenes which call for serious emotion are handled with the correct amount of restraint.It seems that Zwick wants to fit something for everyone into this epic, and he very nearly manages it. Action, adventure, discovery, romance, humour...you name it, it's all here. Where Zwick doesn't manage 100% success is in the expository sequences. The first half of the film is riveting, but some of the later scenes outstay their welcome. Regardless, Zwick should be praised in the many areas he does succeed in, such as the actual battles. These are close to competing with anything to come out of Middle Earth in the last few years. They are beautifully shot and genuinely exciting. Like Peter Jackson, Zwick uses panoramic shots to great effect and even if CGI is being used, you really can't tell. The setting really feels genuine, and therefore it must be commended.
Tom Cruise is undoubtedly more of a star than an actor, and many continue to label him either overly smug or wooden, or both. Recent films, however, have shown that these tags are a little out of order. Actually, I think this is among his best performances of recent times. One of Cruise's central strengths has been his ability to carry a film while not overshadowing everyone around him, and that is exactly what he shows here. Regardless of how the rest of the cast acts, he is still the film's central character, and if Algren is not believable, then the film fails. It's one of the more demanding roles he has played, and he is definitely up to the task, even (apparently) poking fun at his own image once or twice. Certain people will see this as his best chance in years of a Best Actor award (even though I personally don't think it's fully deserved). Cruise's reliability has always left room for certain members of the supporting cast to really steal the show. Cases in point: Renée Zellweger in Jerry Maguire, Samantha Morton in Minority Report. In The Last Samurai, it's Ken Watanabe. We not only accept him more in his role because he is more of an unknown this side, but because, like Cruise, he immerses himself in his character. The difference is he does so with more depth and greater authenticity. Talk of nominations for him should not be dismissed.I'm certain that this will be an Oscar contender. Do I think it should be, though? Well, I would have definitely said yes had it been a little less uneven. A superbly done epic on a grand scale always makes for welcome viewing, though, and The Last Samurai should therefore be warmly received by the majority of those who see it.",Null,0,0,21 January 2004
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The Harry Potter franchise is maintaining a high standard
","Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) has entered his fourth year at Hogwarts' school of witchcraft and wizardry. Both him and his best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are into their teenage years and are having to face the trials and tribulations that come with them. Harry will face a greater trial than either of them, though, when he is selected to perform in the deadly Tri-Wizard tournament...One thing that has struck me about the adaptations of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books is that they have just kept on getting better with age. The Prisoner Of Azkaban was an improvement over the Chamber Of Secrets, which in turn was an improvement over the disappointing Philosopher's Stone.I knew that Mike Newell had a hard act to follow when he took the responsibility of bringing The Goblet Of Fire to the screen. After all, according to yours truly, Alfonso Cuaron had not only improved 'on (Chris) Columbus's (two) Potter instalments more than we could have expected', but he had created 'a Potter film that truly stands on its own.' The bad news is that the run of improvement seems to have come to a halt. The good news is that The Goblet Of Fire really is no worse than the last instalment. I can't say that it stands too well on its own (indeed, character familiarity will help) but this is a very minor complaint. This is a fast moving and energetic adventure capable of being enjoyed by all members of the family.It's as if Newell realised that he would not be able to match the dark atmosphere Alfonso Cuaron created - indeed, I have heard that he did not have as big a budget to work with - but he has focused on his skills with actors, personal issues and storytelling. Despite a slow start to the film, those skills are very much in evidence.The problems associated with adolescence are dealt with capably and in an entertaining fashion, and there is a wide array of striking set pieces for fans and non-fans to enjoy. The way Chris Columbus handled the Quidditch match in the first film now seems rather limp compared to the treats that Cuaron and now Newell have served up. Although the 'wow' factor in terms of special effects is down from the previous film, there's still some delightful visual moments. That, and the film seems scarier than before.The acting appears better than it ever was. Never mind the criticism that is being directed at the acting ability and ageing of the three leads - Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter. The same is true of Rupert Grint & Emma Watson and their respective characters. I wrote last year that the best thing to do would be to hang on to the young leads for as long as possible, for stability's sake, and I maintain that stance. My only concern is that nearly all credibility will be lost by the time The Half Blood Prince comes around.Every other regular (including a returning Jason Isaacs) is as solid as ever. Newcomers include a rather giggly Miranda Richardson as an irritating journalist, Brendan Gleeson as probably the most interesting (and bizarre) Hogwarts teacher of them all, and Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort himself. As if this wasn't enough, we have David 'Doctor Who' Tennant playing somebody who's rotten to the core (this actor is more versatile than you think) and Jarvis Cocker making a surprise cameo.As I said earlier, The Goblet Of Fire has not improved on The Prisoner Of Azkaban, but it has maintained a standard that we can only hope The Order Of The Phoenix will match.David Yates, the camera is yours.Rating: 8/10",8,0,0,11 December 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A wasted opportunity
","No relation to the 1940's Alfred Hitchcock comedy of the same name, Mr. & Mrs. Smith is an actioner/comedy/thriller that manages to entertain in spite of some serious limitations.John Smith (Brad Pitt) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) are not your typical married couple. (Yeah, I know, we've heard stories like this before, but this film's hardly original). They both live a seemingly normal life together, in a nice house in a nice neighbourhood. Both are trained assassins, but they don't even know the truth about one another. That is, until they are dispatched to kill the same target.Shades of Alias, The Incredibles and True Lies consistently surface, from the deceptions to the violence to the thrills. What differentiates Mr. & Mrs. Smith from those other works is its sense of fun.Director Doug Liman showed with The Bourne Identity that he is adept with action, and films such as Go have shown his skill with plotting and character. Unfortunately the film's plot is all over the place, even when the film is at its most entertaining, and the character moments are rather ordinary.It is saved mostly due to the sparring between the two leads. When Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are on screen together, competing with one another either verbally or physically, this film really soars. (Jolie has more than just atoned for her performance in Alexander here; for the first time in a long while, I found her tolerable.) This, in addition to some inventive set design and cool gadgets, is what effectively constitutes half, it not more, of the film. At one point I was convinced that this would be my first truly unqualified recommendation of the summer.Alas, not long after John and Jane find each other out, the fun, laughs and excitement give way to a succession of eventually tedious chases and shoot-outs. After being very entertaining for long periods, the film begins to outstay its welcome very quickly. There are still some enjoyably quirky moments hidden in there, but I doubt that most viewers will still be as attentive by this point.I would have appreciated Mr. & Mrs. Smith more if it had maintained the tone that came before the generic action scenes throughout the entire film. Then again, that probably wouldn't have filled up the two hour running length, would it? Mr. & Mrs. Smith is entertaining enough, I suppose, but in my opinion it's a wasted opportunity. And that's not the first of those I've come across this season.Rating: 6/10",6,40,86,11 June 2005
War of the Worlds," Will Spielberg ever truly reach the dark side?
","There is a simple reason why Steven Spielberg is so popular among many. He has an ability to place you in the moment that few other contemporary directors have. Even his worst films have their redeeming qualities - qualities that generally stay with you, and make those films worth a glance. He is undeniably sentimental and manipulative, but he is one of the best - if not THE best - at being so. His best films have made drama genuinely moving, rather than nauseating, and most of the suspenseful set pieces he has created have been inspired and stood the test of time, even if they have (unfortunately) driven on endless imitators.With War Of The Worlds, Spielberg has attempted a bleak vision of the future for the third time. In his previous two attempts - AI and Minority Report - he came agonisingly close to the dark side (in my view, he has never come closer than Schindler's List, and even then he stumbled a tiny bit), but overly sentimental and not-entirely-logical endings severely damaged both efforts. However, they were still enough positives about Minority Report to earn it more widespread critical acclaim and a strong recommendation from me (which still stands today).War Of The Worlds looked promising. The central crew of all his films from Schindler's List onwards was still in place. Realising just how successful his last collaboration with Tom Cruise was, he recalled him to play the lead role. Respected actors such as Miranda Otto (recently made more famous thanks to The Lord Of The Rings trilogy), Tim Robbins and gifted child actor Dakota Fanning were also cast.A modern-day remake of the classic H.G. Wells story, War Of The Worlds' protagonist is dock worker Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise). His family life is in pieces - neither his son Robbie (Justin Chatwin) nor daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning) fully appreciate him. So when his ex-wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) leaves the kids around for a weekend visit, it looks like another case of awkward bonding. Then a bizarre storm starts brewing...And at last, we think, the dark side will not elude Spielberg. The aliens are coming, and their goal is, in one word, extermination. And so we watch as the human race fights to survive against the aliens in the tripods.All of the action scenes hold your attention, and some are truly breathtaking. One of these is a suspense scene that's reminiscent of the spy-der search from Minority Report. I might even argue that it tops that particular scene. There's holocaust-style imagery that leaves an incredible impact. Once again, Spielberg manages to draw a reasonable performance from Tom Cruise (although he was acting a little too smarmy for my liking in the early stages of the film). And, as always, Spielberg shows his indefatigable gift for getting the most from child actors. Dakota Fanning proves to be the perfect choice for Spielberg's latest wide-eyed protagonist. Refreshingly, her character is not such a cheap ploy for sympathy.But hang on...didn't I mention earlier on that Spielberg doesn't seem to know how to end these kind of films? I won't spoil the ending for you, but I can say that while it's not as damaging as AI's ending was, it is still poorly executed. The ending's not the only cop-out; I seem to recall an action scene that was all-too-conveniently resolved. I can also recall a couple of references to ET. Nice touches though they are, we're not really looking for 'nice' in War Of The Worlds, are we? And somehow, I think we could have done without Morgan Freeman's voice-overs, Steve.Worst of all, when we look at the picture as a whole, we suddenly see that War Of The Worlds doesn't really add up to much. It's brilliantly executed, to be sure, but the best science fiction has always dealt more with ideas as well as action. For the sake of crafting a modern blockbuster, Spielberg tends to have set almost all meaning aside at the expense of action scenes and only marginally successful character bonding moments. (Then again, maybe this is more the fault of the screenwriters...) When you see what Spielberg is capable of as a director you find yourself expecting more than what he delivers here.In a nutshell, War Of The Worlds is another missed opportunity in the Spielberg catalogue. It's undoubtedly worth watching, and it fits the bill as a summer movie, but like Minority Report before it, its lack of focus has prevented it from realising its true potential.Rating: 6.5/10",6,1,3,1 July 2005
Love Actually," It's quite good, actually
","Rating: *** (out of *****)Well, we've arrived at one of the season's most-awaited films  Richard Curtis's directorial debut, Love Actually. Like many, I hold Curtis's written work in very high regard, especially the likes of Blackadder, Four Weddings & a Funeral and Bridget Jones's Diary.So the thought of seeing a film both written and directed by him is bound to cheer up his fans. But Love Actually has more going for it than that, like a star-studded British cast and the Christmassy setting. I remember how Notting Hill pleased many of us in the summer some four years ago, so what will stop Love Actually doing the same at Christmas? On this evidence, absolutely nothing.The film has not one, but at least NINE significant plotlines. That tells you this film is obviously going to be an ensemble piece. And what an ensemble there is. We have the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falling in love with a tea lady (Martine McCutcheon). Then we see Colin Firth as an author who falls for his Portuguese maid (Lucia Moniz), Liam Neeson as a widower looking for more love while helping his son (Thomas Sangster) to cope with a schoolboy crush, and Alan Rickman neglecting his wife (Emma Thompson) in favour of flirting with a younger woman. And that's not all. Mark (Andrew Lincoln) is hopelessly smitten with Juliette (Keira Knightley), the new wife of his best friend (Chiwetel Ejiofor).  Colin (Kris Marshall) is looking for women in America. Love could be blossoming for two porn stars (Martin Freeman & Joanna Page) & two office workers (Laura Linney & Rodrigo Santoro). And, last but not least, ageing rocker Billy Mack (Bill Nighy) has an unorthodox way of attempting to top the charts. Love is definitely all around.Cynics have already attacked the film. Yes, some of the subplots in Love Actually are a little too incredulous. Yes, it has no substance, no real plot and is more sentimental than Curtis's previous offerings. But haven't critics seen enough Richard Curtis films to realise that journeys into 'Curtisland', as we call them, are meant to take you away from reality? We want Love Actually to be funny and sometimes moving, and that is precisely what it is. At not one point were my eyes diverted away from the screen, which is probably the best compliment you can give to this kind of film. The detractors can talk about the excessive sentimentality all they like. Frankly, if Curtis's formula isn't broken in any way, why should he modify it?The stories may be simple, but the plotting isn't. Rather, the plotting is a little too ambitious. There are few  if any  real characters to be found. Here's an example: at the beginning, instead of watching Juliette, we feel more like we're watching Keira Knightley in a wedding dress. Knightley, like many, doesn't have much to do, for she is merely the object of Andrew Lincoln's affection. Speaking of Lincoln, I didn't see a lot of difference between his Mark and Teachers' Simon. But that sums up the cast in general. The unknowns are more credible in their roles because we are not distracted by star recognition. I mean, who won't see a little of My Family's Nick in Kris Marshall's Colin? Or a bit of Martin Freeman's alter ego from The Office in his character? I think you get the message. Even Hugh Grant is pretty much being himself as the PM (although he is careful not to tread too far towards his About a Boy persona). Still, him and Billy Bob Thornton, who plays the US President, are great fun to watch, and Martine McCutcheon is convincing in her film debut (mind you, she's been around for so long that you forget that's the case). The only real character, however, belongs to Bill Nighy, and he is hilarious in his role. Everyone else just plays themselves, looking like they're having a ball. Just like Richard Curtis. He has taken few risks, adopting a laid back approach and letting the actors enjoy themselves. As a result, instead of coming up with the ultimate romantic comedy, as the ads have trumpeted, he has made what is purely a solidly entertaining diversion. But the film will be a success. To cover such a large ensemble in 2 ¼ hours was overambitious, and it shows (in this respect I was reminded of Gosford Park), but Curtis has still done enough to make his audience feel happy. And that's exactly what you want from a romantic comedy, isn't it?",Null,0,2,27 November 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," 'Revenge' is sweet
","Written and directed by George LucasStarring Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, Frank OzIn the midst of the generally positive response to the final Star Wars prequel, there are still those that say the new films are just not up to the standard of the original trilogy. They say things like: The spontaneity and the magic have gone, we know what's going to happen, Star Wars is nothing but a cynical franchise now, does this story really need to be stretched out over three films, etc., etc.Well, after viewing Episode III (aka Revenge Of The Sith) myself, I've concluded that perhaps some of the above criticisms are right, but not all of them. Some of the 'magic' is still there. Admit it, didn't the trailer leave you optimistic? And of course it is possible for a film to enthrall even though you know what's coming. Look at the joy we have got from re-viewing the best action and suspense films. The key to these movies' success is not so much what they do as how they do it. And Revenge Of The Sith is implemented well enough to rank as the best of the prequels, even if it is a tiny cut below even Return Of The Jedi.While Episodes I and II were watchable, their problems were too obvious. Effects had taken over. The bad dialogue was more ever-present than before. The characters and stories just weren't as interesting. Episode III has rectified these errors to a large extent, if not entirely. The result is a crisp, thrilling and occasionally brilliant narrative with some of the best battles in the whole Star Wars saga. It's not exactly the 'Titanic in space' that George Lucas said it would be, and I'm thankful for that. I doubt many would have tolerated another big and wooden love story, especially after the mess Lucas made of it in Episode II. Fortunately, he knows how to restrain himself this time. Love is still a prevalent theme in Star Wars (and to an extent, it always has been) but the focus is on, as the opening title card states, 'War!' Indeed. The moment the famed scrolling text disappears, we are plunged straight into the action as the Jedi attempt to save Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from his captors, Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and General Grievous.What the Jedi council don't know about yet are the corrupt plans that Palpatine (or Darth Sidious) has for Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). These plans will help Anakin obtain power that could preserve Anakin's secret marriage to Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman). Of course, Anakin is taken in by Palpatine's idea, but the likes of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), unsettled by Palpatine's growing influence, are uneasy about this. Of course, they can't prove anything yet, and they still have the matter of attacks on the Republic to take care of.Signs of Anakin's eventual transformation into Darth Vader appear right from the beginning. Palpatine plays a key role in the conversion, but the triggers for it are different, and rather shocking. So too are the results. There are scenes in this movie that you would have thought were beyond Lucas' ability as a filmmaker. He outdoes himself not only with some of the emotional scenes (yes, even Padmé and Anakin have one genuinely bearable moment together) but also with some of the battles (such as the final light-saber showdowns between Palpatine & Yoda and Obi-Wan & Anakin/Darth Vader respectively). There's good chase scenes too - one between Grievous and Obi-Wan stands out. When Episode III takes off, it really soars. Episode II only postponed the inevitable; the conclusion of this film is especially hard-hitting.That could probably be because Lucas has better actors here working with him than in the original three films. Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Samuel L. Jackson have nothing to prove here, and to a degree, they transfer the skills they already have (although Portman is criminally wasted). But if I had to give someone real credit, it would be Ian McDiarmid, the most under-appreciated actor in the entire saga in my opinion. His transformation from Chancellor to Emperor is one of the film's standout moments. Watching him subtly lure Anakin to the dark side is eerily chilling.The jury is still out on Hayden Christensen, however. He has won over critics with his performance in Shattered Glass, and is significantly better here than he was in the shoes of the whiny and sometimes annoying Anakin of Episode II. And the way he handles his light-saber duels has to be seen to be believed. Alas, there are times when his old weaknesses come seeping through. But is this more the fault of George Lucas? It probably is. You know how Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness felt when speaking their lines. And dialogue's not the only problem. Lucas has taken these prequels far, far too seriously. Of course they're entertaining, but the playful tone of the originals has been toned down too much. I can't help wondering if only the true, hardcore fans will fully appreciate Episode III, and it's not likely to welcome any new fans to the saga. Those who are expecting it to hit the heights of Episodes IV and V will definitely be a little disappointed.But let's forget about what Episode III isn't and appreciate it for what it is - a well produced, gripping summer blockbuster that brings this saga to a dignified, if not earth-shattering end. And that's pretty much all that needs to be said.Rating: 7.5/10",7,8,14,22 May 2005
The Terminal," Hanks and Spielberg team up again for a sometimes saccharine and overlong, but very enjoyable, effort.
","Rating: **** (out of *****)The latest Steven Spielberg film asks the following question: What if you were forced to live in an airport terminal indefinitely, with the eyes of the men in charge, and possibly the rest of the world, upon you?Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a citizen of the fictional country of Krakozhia. Poor Viktor  he only wanted to fly to New York to carry out a brief errand, but all that he has found out is that his country is under siege, leaving him with both a cancelled VISA and the inability to return home. A meeting with JFK Airport chief Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) leads him to realize that he can't enter the United States either, and as a result, he is trapped in the terminal. Living there initially proves a hard slog, especially considering his language difficulties, but in time he finds both friendship and even love from the most unlikely of places.The Terminal has the inventiveness of Cast Away and the implausibility of Love Actually, with a premise that draws memories of The Truman Show. (Not surprising, really, when you see that The Truman Show's writer, Andrew Niccol, is one of the credited writers.) All these elements, perhaps surprisingly, work in its favour  even though you feel echoes of all the aforementioned films, this film stands on its own to the point where you should enjoy it very much. But you must suspend your disbelief before you enter the cinema. For only on Planet Spielberg do you find airport terminals as attractive and conveniently constructed as this one. Only on Planet Spielberg would you find both a caring and beautiful INS agent (in the form of Zoë Saldana). And only on Planet Spielberg do you see stewardesses who look uncannily like Catherine Zeta Jones.And then there's the product placement, which is needed to make the setting more realistic (yeah, sure). Sorry Steve, I let you off the hook in Minority Report because at least there you were using the brand names to illustrate invasion of privacy. It doesn't seem like that here. I'm almost certain now that what Minority Report did for the GAP & Lexus, The Terminal will do for Burger King, Starbucks and Hugo Boss.Spielberg has fallen foul of some critics by casting the all-American everyman, Tom Hanks, as the Russian, sorry, Krakozhian immigrant. But I bought Hanks as Navorski. There's nothing exaggerated or unsubtle about Viktor's mannerisms. No overreacting, no melodrama, just a restrained portrayal (with a plausible accent). The comparisons to Forrest Gump have been floating around, but they shouldn't be  Viktor's innocence comes not from what he is, but the land he is in.Even though all of the other characters seem like they would only exist in a fantasy (and that is, after all, what The Terminal is) the actors playing them invest them with the right amount of believability. For example, even though Stanley Tucci's character is unfortunately overwritten, Tucci plays him with enough restraint that he is credible. What puzzles me, though, is how Catherine Zeta Jones can remain such a mystery; so irritating off screen, yet rather charming on screen. The Terminal succeeds better than Love Actually because Spielberg doesn't try too hard to give all the characters equal screen time. This isn't an ensemble piece, and although we see enough of the supporting cast, the focus is always on Viktor Navorski. Yeah, the film is predictable. It's sometimes really corny, and Spielberg, as with his last two films, doesn't really know when to end the film. Yet in general, it leaves you with an unmistakable smile on your face throughout  and really, what more could you ask for?",Null,0,0,5 September 2004
X2: X-Men United," More ambitious, but better?
","The sequel to 2000's X-Men is certainly a more ambitious film than its predecessor, and, in many ways, a superior film as well. Director Bryan Singer has built on the strengths of the original and added more action, and the results are effective.We pick up almost exactly from where we left off in the first film. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his band of X-Men face an even tougher challenge than last time round. after an attack on the US president by a mutant known as Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming). Thus General William Stryker (Brian Cox) who has always been opposed to mutants, vows to begin a full scale war against them. So this means that Xavier must team up with Magneto (Ian McKellen) and his colleagues - thus explaining the film's subtitle, `X-Men United'. In an ensemble piece such as this, acting is generally irrelevant, but everyone does what you'd expect from them. The newcomers, which include Nightcrawler, Pyro (Aaron Stanford) and Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu, from The Scorpion King), all fit into place seamlessly. Also, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Storm (Halle Berry) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) get more screen time than before, although the same can't be said for James Marsden's Cyclops.At 2 hours and 10 minutes, you'd think Singer was aiming for a Superman-like epic with this film. You get the feeling that he wants to humanise most of the ensemble - however, their size, along with the time required for the action scenes, ensures that this task is doomed to failure. As a result, we never really identify strongly with anyone (with the possible exception of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine). This weakens the emotional impact of some important scenes. That said, some viewers may have been dissatisfied had too long been spent on character-building and less on action. But, truth be told, you cannot please everyone, and Singer has done probably the best he could have done with the material at his disposal.The greater emphasis on action in this sequel has given us more chances to see the mutants' powers - and some powers they are too. And there's also the (now obligatory) smart in-jokes, though they're generally not as clever as the original's.So, in a nutshell, X2 is a bigger, brighter and louder version of X-Men that delivers just as much, if not more, than the original, while also standing up well on its own terms. For some, it can act as the perfect appetizer for The Matrix Reloaded.",Null,0,0,10 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Hail to the King
","Rating: ***** (out of *****)Is it true? Are we really supposed to believe the reviews that tell us the final film in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings saga is the best of them all? The answer is yes. Those reviews are right in every possible way. I don't know how Peter Jackson has done it, but he has.Men and women of all ages have been captivated by Jackson's vision of Tolkien's tale of good and evil, and with good reason. His modernisation of the story will appeal to everyone and stand the test of time. View the films as a whole and you are looking at one fine epic. They have just got better as the story has progressed, and I don't say that just because they've gradually grown on me. Throughout the trilogy, the actors and characters have become more rounded (in general), the battles have become more impressive, and the story more ambitious.Of course, there's been the usual nitpicking, especially with this film. Where is Christopher Lee's Saruman, for example? (Luckily he wasn't a true necessity) There's no scouring of the Shire, either. (Well, Jackson believes that it would have been out of place.) What about the occasional small problem? Well, the films have been showing some signs of inconsistency as the story has progressed, but...The Lord of the Rings succeeds, because  quite simply  it has it all. It contains action, suspense, strong storytelling, romance, humour and good characterisations. And on top of that, the films are technically impressive. You have to give immense praise to a film that's a joy to look at as well as follow.We resume affairs with an inventive flashback which shows how Gollum/Smeagol (Andy Serkis) was corrupted by the discovery of Sauron's Ring (We'll soon see that it's not only him who will be corrupted). Soon it's back to watching his attempts to lead Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) to Mordor, where they can destroy the Ring once and for all. But Gollum is rapidly becoming less of a guide and more of a hindrance. His 'precious' ring has darkened him a little too much, and even Frodo is feeling this dark influence. This calls for Sam to show a new side to his character.At the same time, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) must claim his rightful place at the throne of Gondor. But Denethor (John Noble), father of Boromir & Faramir and steward to the throne, is having none of it. Not even Gandalf (Ian McKellen) can make him see sense. That is only one problem, though. King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and the army of Rohan must reunite with Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom), among others, to defend the city of Minas Tirith. Hobbits Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) are ready to lend their own contributions as well. As is Eowyn (Miranda Otto). This is only part of the story. Many more surprises are in store for viewers, including another great battle. But what's really amazing is that the film succeeds even when you least expect it to. I thought that Annie Lennox wasn't right for the closing song. I was wrong. I thought that the film would be severely hampered by Saruman's absence. Again, I was wrong (although purists may disagree). I stated in my review of The Two Towers that I 'would have liked to have seen more of Eowyn, especially in the battle'. My wish was granted, in a pleasantly surprising way.One of the things I like most about The Return of the King is that everyone gets their moment in the spotlight. Even the elves, including Arwen (Liv Tyler) and Elrond (Hugo Weaving) have significant roles to play in the story, and Jackson makes sure we're aware of that. I can't recall one moment in the film that didn't work at all. Yes, the film slows down a little on two occasions, but even then it's not very long before it locks you in again. And though I've heard complaints about the long, slightly sentimental epilogue, I saw no problem with it. It wraps up the saga quite nicely.There really is too much to say. I could go on and discuss how the music and cinematography are better than ever, for example. But we have to mention the actors. With The Return of the King, Elijah Wood has not just taken the ring as a burden, he has taken the film on as well. There is now no doubt that this man can carry a film when required. As can Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen (arguably the definitive Gandalf), and Andy Serkis (without whom Gollum would not be so believable). Talk of awards for Serkis should increase this year.More is demanded of Sean Astin (as Sam's importance to the story increases), and he delivers. And the not so well-known names, like Miranda Otto, Billy Boyd & Dominic Monaghan, get a chance to display talents that we previously weren't aware of.The trilogy can be summed up in three words  Dark, Darker, Darkest. That is the direction it has followed during its three year-life, although it wasn't that dark in the beginning, was it? How times have changed. (OK, one part of The Return of the King is reminiscent of Return of the Jedi, but that's the only similarity. I mean, I didn't see any cute Ewok-like characters.) And in that period, countless new Lord of the Rings fans have been made. Regardless of whether The Return of the King propels the trilogy to a deserving Oscar, it and its prequels will unquestionably stick in the mind of many of their viewers for years to come.",Null,0,0,21 January 2004
Munich," Spielberg wrestles with moral ambiguity
","The Olympic village, Munich, 1972. Eleven Israeli athletes are taken hostage and murdered by a group of Palestinian terrorists known as the Black September group. The Mossad strikes back by launching a team of Israelis led by Avner (Eric Bana) to hunt down and kill those responsible...Before anyone starts asking if Steven Spielberg's Munich really is better than his 'crowning achievement', Schindler's List, I think I'd better get to the far more important question - is the film a valuable artistic experience? To that, my answer is an emphatic 'Yes'.From the moment you are transported back to Munich, you are 'in the moment'. That, to me, has always been the key to Spielberg's success. When his methods succeed, you are genuinely immersed in the experience. He can even handle sentimentality better than any other director. Unfortunately, when it goes wrong for him, it really turns nauseating; consider, if you like, the endings of A.I. and War Of The Worlds as examples.Consistency isn't one of Steve's greatest strengths either. How many times have you seen him try to force an over-emotional moment into a dark film, even if it does work? (Key example: Schindler's List.) However, there are times when he manages to reign in the emotion successfully, resulting in more consistent works like the underrated Empire Of The Sun and Catch Me If You Can. Munich is worthy of inclusion on that list of works.Yes, there is sentiment and 'shocking moments' (which he is especially good at) but he carefully sprinkles them throughout, never letting them get in the way of the story. Rather, they assist the story brilliantly. In fact, remove them and the all-too-recognisable (if admittedly superb) camera-work of Janusz Kaminski and you'd find it hard to tell that Munich was a Spielberg film. It is a remarkably controlled, brilliantly staged and very well acted work. Of course, it helps that he has (once again) chosen a talented multi-national cast  Eric Bana, Mathieu Kassovitz, Ciaran Hinds and future 007 Daniel Craig all stand out. Bana especially; there is nothing remotely exaggerated or forced about his performance.Perhaps most striking of all is Munich's moral ambiguity. Spielberg has been constantly under attack over the years for his 'black and white' view of the world. (The way he treats the Nazis in his films, with the possible exception of Amon Goeth, is concrete evidence of this.) Avner doubts the rationality of the revenge mission early on and the rest of his team soon follow suit  unfortunately, some of them don't find out what is really going on until it's too late. The tables are eventually turned on Avner and the group. Once hunters, they become the hunted. They realise what it is like to be the 'enemy' and wonder why they weren't more opposed to the movement he joined in the first place. A Spielberg detractor once said that the director could never make a film that showed that 'potentially, we are (the bad guys)'...well, he may not quite have made it, but with Munich, he's come as close as you ever can expect him to. The scenes that show the dying 'targets' are deeply affecting.The only serious problem with the film is the length. For all of its strengths, it just isn't taut enough for me to regard it as a masterpiece. That, my friends, is what prevents it from reaching the heights of Schindler's List. But that is irrelevant. Since when was Munich about topping the earlier film anyway? With Munich, Steven Spielberg has given us a thought-provoking history lesson that may, eventually, have more valuable historical impact than any of his previous serious films.",8,0,0,27 January 2006
The Bourne Supremacy," Damon's spy franchise has hit the ground running.
","Rating: **** (out of *****)Two years on from the events of The Bourne Identity, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is holidaying with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) before he is suddenly tracked by both a Russian hired killer (Karl Urban), and the CIA, who hold him responsible for a murder. Once again, he has to go on the run, and thus set the scene for a series of previously unexpected (and eventful) happeningsAt a time when the James Bond franchise is literally at an all-time low  the last entry was a failure and they don't even have anyone to play 007 at present  it is a relief to know that there are people who can still give us very good espionage thrillers, in the form of the cinematic adaptations of Robert Ludlum's Bourne novels. The Bourne Identity was solid entertainment, but The Bourne Supremacy is pretty close to excellent. It is supreme in almost every way.I haven't said that much about the plot, because doing so would only reveal several surprises, twists and complexities that beat almost anything I've seen this year. What I will say is that it is certainly best to have seen The Bourne Identity before you see this. Not that you will be lost in the plot of this film or anything, but seeing the first film will lend an air of familiarity.This film's tempo is more consistent, John Powell's excellent score is more prominent, and the action scenes are suitably fast paced. Best of all, Matt Damon has brushed off the stiffness that was apparent in The Bourne Identity and truly made this role his own. This is a near-perfect spy performance. (I wonder if his fans would consider him a good Bond if he wasn't American.)The supporting cast is as strong as before, if not stronger. Joan Allen effectively reprises Chris Cooper's role from The Bourne Identity, but does so more mildly and with greater subtlety. Of the newcomers, she is the most welcome. Franka Potente, Julia Stiles and Brian Cox return (with Cox getting the chance to show his more chilling side), and Karl Urban (The Lord of the Rings' Eomer) proves to be a more dangerous adversary for Bourne than Clive Owen. Another pleasant surprise is a small part for Oksana Akinshina (Lilja 4-Ever).Doug Liman has stepped away from directing duties, leaving Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday) in charge of the action. He is a competent replacement, matching to at least match Liman in all areas except the action scenes  and this is one of the film's minor weaknesses. Too often he relies on the use of quick cutting and the shaky cam, and this is just an example of typical action director clichés being overused. Yes, I know that he's trying to put us in the heat of the moment, but he's trying too hard. Another weakness is that there's a distinct lack of heart in the film, which is probably due to the cold and distancing approach adopted by most of the actors. Just that little bit extra emotional depth would lift The Bourne Supremacy up to the level of a From Russia With Love. Even so, I highly recommend this to anyone. Plus, since there's another Robert Ludlum novel that has yet to be converted into a film (The Bourne Ultimatum), I think that there might just be at least one smart spy thriller that we can definitely look forward to in the coming years.",Null,0,1,15 August 2004
