The Ring," It scared me!!!!!
","I have never seen the original, so I don't have anything to compare this movie to.  I will say this, I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time.  This movie kept my attention and was pretty creepy.  I loved every minute of it.  There are some scenes in this movie that will make the hair on your arms stand at attention.  If you are into this genre of film, go see this movie.  It is definitely one of the best suspense films I have seen in a very long time and it gets a 10 on the 'oh no, not that' scale.",9,1,2,10 October 2002
