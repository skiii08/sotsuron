The Avengers," Awesome
","A truly fantastic movie and the first of its kind. Marvel did a terrific job. Way to go. Making so many superhero movies and connecting all to each other is a hell of a job. When it all started with Iron Man (2008), no one could imagine that the franchise would grow this big. All because of Marvel we were able to enjoy this movie. Only months remaining for Age of Ultron to come and I'm sure that will surpass this movie too. Tom Hiddleston did a great job in the movie as Loki. Robert Downey Jr. was always great as usual. And along with him every other actor namely Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel Jackson. Special mention Cobie Smulders and Clark Gregg!!!!!",10,3,7,29 January 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Terrific
","In short the movie was terrific. In spite of the big cast, the story has been built up beautifully. Every one has had their chance to make a mark in the movie. The fighting scenes were shown beautifully. It was planned and made perfectly. This marks the beginning of the 3rd phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Marvel did it with style. The 3rd phase already got a kick-start. The story had a different theme here. Marvel has always launched a solo film of every superhero before adding them to a cast in the big banner movies. But this time they did well and experimented by adding Black Panther to the cast who hasn't yet had a solo movie. Apart from all the brilliant performances, the addition of Spider- Man to this Universe was welcoming. Hope this phase also builds up the story of Infinity War slowly and steadily. And the road leads to the end in an interesting way. Also waiting for the rest of the movies of the third phase, especially the new heroes that are to be introduced to the Universe. Hope they also does well and the story is connected.",9,15,30,7 May 2016
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Awesome
","Marvel has done it again. A successful and terrific ending to Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). And it's correct that without a strong villain, it's never so much fun. And Ultron is bad ass. James Spader has done an awesome job. Have to mention Paul Bettany as Vision is good. Vision saved the day. No need to mention the other performances by the previous cast because they are awesome as always. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch was a nice addition to the team. Good performances by Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elisabeth Olsen. Age of Ultron was an enjoyment to watch. Joss Whedon has also done a good job with the script. He has not wasted time on unnecessary plot. He hit the track right away. It was good to see how the Avengers have created a bonding with each other.",9,1,8,20 May 2015
