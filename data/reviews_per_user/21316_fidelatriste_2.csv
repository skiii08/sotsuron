Hereditary," A nightmare.
","Hereditary turned out to be my nightmare as I was trying so hard to stay on the movie.
It was slow but full of tension. I was trying to escape the studio half time but I made it, with a headache afterwards.Thank you, Hereditary. Nice performance, perfectly built ambience, sound was incredible. Well done!",8,0,2,22 March 2019
A Quiet Place," Suspenseful
","This movie has set up a new 'genre', as a few movies have been created with the same style afterwards.A Quiet Place has brought a new experience of suspension to the viewers. Alongside with the stuck feeling, that forced us to 'survive' throughout the movie.Nice try.",8,0,1,22 March 2019
