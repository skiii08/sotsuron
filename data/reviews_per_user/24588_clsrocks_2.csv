The Avengers," An honest confession !!!!!
","So much to say yet so little space .I feel like I am short of words today. But after watching this flick in IMAX reald 3d I figure all of you would be as speechless as I am. Where do I begin Where do I end? The moral dilemma I am in to write this review.But Joss Whedon was one guy who knew exactly where to start and where to end in this Marvel fantasy epic. Yes the marvel cinematic universe was already in place. All the characters had been pre-established and had their own individual fan following. So how do you get a bunch of franchises all into one? Just do what Mark Millar did in the Ultimates Vol.1.So you have a ready-made script which you need to modify very little of. Minor adjustments to make the 'Hulk' look like a good guy etc. and presto you have a script. Casting was never a problem anyway. Since Merril Lynch gave you 300 million USD to make this visual effects extravaganza the CGI was hardly ever going to be a problem with Industrial Lights and Magic on your side. But where Whedon succeeds is the characterization. Every one from Chris Evans(Captain America) to Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) have their own screen time to develop their characters and story. Marvel has done this before in X-men etc. but this movie just outdoes everything they ever made. The brilliance of Mr.Whedon is clearly seen here. I guess all those years of working in Buffyverse finally paid off! I initially thought it would be a Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.) ride all the way. I even wore my Iron Man T-shirt as well. Thankfully it was not so everybody pitches in equally and its fun to watch.The plot line is pretty simple and straight forward. A bunch of aliens try to attack earth with Loki (Tom Hiddlestone) leading the way. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) tries to bring in 'The Avengers' to bash the alien scum out of Earth. We all know how it turns out but its fun to watch it the way it happens, the way joss makes it happen. Yes the final battle sequence feels a little 'Star Warsy' and 'Transformersy' with the alien airspeeders flying all over the place and huge gigantic slug like creatures falling out of the sky but its still amazing to watch and is a visceral treat. I just can't wait for Avengers 2 to come out.Hope they do the 'Civil War' storyline (also by Mark Millar the genius that he is...). Wondering where the confession part is in all of thisÂ….. well here it is .I enjoyed it like a guilty pleasure. For me it was revenge. Revenge on everyone who calls us avid comic book follower's geeks or junkies! It was a slap in the face to all the cocky bastards who criticized me ever since I was in sixth grade until now for reading comic books calling them kids' stuff. Those same guys would be inside the movie screens this week watching the 'Avengers' I am sure. If they are not well the they're even dumber than I thought. This movie brought back my memories of being a kid with bronchitis sitting on his bed dosed up with meds with nothing but a 'Captain America' and 'Iron Man' issue to keep him company. Of course I had the 'Justice League' and 'Batman' but since this is a marvel movie I will leave out the DC guys till TDKR comes out.I am no 'Captain America' but I am a patriot. Yeah the movie released in India a week earlier before the U.S which was uber cool. Also Bruce Banner is on the run and hiding in Calcutta so yes he speaks Hindi. Also the end credits track is played by Soundgarden (Chris Cornell) who happen to be one of my most favorite band of all time (Yeah my first love is comic books second is guitar based hard rock...go figure!!!!).Their lead guitarist is a guy of Indian origin. He is called Kim Thayil and he rocks hard.So to sum it all up whether your young or old assemble your fellow avengers go to your nearest movie screen and shout it out loud ' Avengers Assemble!' and make Marvel all the money they deserve for giving us a fantastic movie experience.",9,3,8,27 April 2012
Spectre," RetroSpectre
","Well what can we say. Another year another bond movie. Some say its spectacular and some say its ridiculous. Well which one is it?To be honest its the latter. This is probably the weakest James Bond movies of all time. Not trying to be a critic here, but even ' Die Another Day' was more entertaining than this movie. This coming from a person who has seen all the earlier movies and is a true fan of the franchise. Also I am a huge fan of Daniel Craig's acting and Sam Mendes' directing skills. But all of that and a 300 million budget cannot save 'Spectre' from being the most boring movie of 2015. As mentioned by everyone else the strongest thing about this movie is the single shot starting scene which is brilliant. After that it all goes downhill. The theme song is pretty crappy with Sam Smith literally crying compared to the amazing Adele from Skyfall.Monica Belluci appears for ten seconds just to have an intimate moment with bond whom she just met like three seconds ago. Batista the beast is pretty much useless and has a silent role without any real dialogue. There is a medical clinic, high in the mountains of Austria for some reason. We met the evil woman from Mission Impossible : Ghost Protocol who is the female lead here. Bond needs to find what L'American is. He does everything to find what it is other than use Google search, as this movie is against technology. Because if we use technology the double O program will be obsolete and all that.Bond crashes planes and escapes unscathed. He shoots Helicopters in the air with his Walther(amazing range that gun has). Christoph Waltz is completely under utilized as Blofeld. The reason why he wants to torture bond is so silly that I wanted to kill myself. Also they already kind of did that in Austin Powers Goldmember where Dr. evil and Austin end up as brothers. The real reason for all this negativity is that after Skyfall we expected more from MGM and the Brocoli's and they failed to deliver. Today's audience you will find is not a forgiving one. Having said all of this I think its time to hit the reboot button again for this franchise. Although I would love to see Craig do another one which I hope ends up like Skyfall or Casino Royale. But hey I am the king of wishful thinking !!!",5,11,31,31 October 2015
