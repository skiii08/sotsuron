Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Good finish, should've been one movie
","While I've read that Tarantino had no intentions of breaking the movie into two at the start, I'm sure he's not too upset at the reward of being #1 in the box office twice for the same film. The ending took where Volume 1 leaves off and runs with it. This film is not as action packed. Despite my love of Tarantino's work with dialogue, there are times when the talking seems to go on too long.
 Nevertheless, excellent work from Thurman and Carradine. Daryl Hannah played a role I didn't think she had in her and Madsen delivers his typical performance.  This film is for Tarantino fans only. I fear those outside our group wont get it.",7,0,1,18 April 2004
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The most dangerous and cunning comedy that I've seen in years.
","After you see this movie, I guarantee that you will leave the theater, speechless, for a while. South Park delivers a comedy that holds no limits and explodes in a violent assault on every race, creed, group, sex, or affiliation and doesn't give in, ever. If you are somebody who is easily hurt when hearing constant bashing of minorities and foreigners or if you are offended by the use of foul language, don't see this movie. For the rest of the public though, this is the best comedy that I've seen in a long time. Like any other South Park episode, the movie has an elaborate story that is completely bizarre and impossible, but believable enough to enjoy. Unlike the television show though, this movie holds no limits on cussing and cleanliness, along with the fact that it is a musical. Unless you are a very uptight individual, the movie will make you laugh until your ribs hurt and then you will laugh some more. I've always felt that I knew dirty comedy, but there were sexual bashes in this movie that I didn't even understand. This is truly an excellent work of comedy in its darkest form. The fact that Trey Parker and Matt Stone used this movie as a way to get back at the stupid MPAA is even better. Well I congratulate Parker and Stone, because this movie was incredible and made me a much bigger fan of the series. Better than Austin Powers and Big Daddy, if you're a fan of cutting-edge comedy, South Park is your summer ticket. I give it a 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,8 July 1999
Armageddon," A pretty good movie, until they take off into space.
","You've got a disaster movie about an asteroid coming straight to Earth and a possibility of killing all human kind. Than you put Bruce Willis in the starring role and cast a wide collection of colorful supporting characters. With all this, it would be impossible to make a boring movie. In fact, this was beginning to be the best disaster movie since the Poseidan Adventure, but then they took off into space and this movie went all to hell. Bruce Willis basically plays himself as the best oil driller on Earth and is called up to destroy the asteroid heading to the Earth. Of course, Willis needs his crew to get the job done. Ben Affleck is a good young actor, but he needs to choose better roles, because all he does in this movie is place himself as a teen idol stud and not a promising actor. I think Liv Tyler is highly overrated not only in looks, but also abilities. Consider that Tyler was out-acted by Alicia Silverstone in the Aerosmith videos, that is very sad.Thankfully, led by Will Patton and Steve Buscemi, the rest of the crew is wonderful and sets this movie off with a bang during an excellent first half of the movie, showing them training and pulling off non-stop comedy and intelligent dialogue. But like I said before, than they had to take off. As soon as you see space in this film, it takes a huge nose dive. At this point, Billy Bob Thornton gains a big chunk of control in this movie and that isn't good. Thornton did a great job in Sling Blade, but since that he has virtually done a terrible job in anything since and this is no exception. The whole space mission is hobbled through the fact that too much happens with questionable possibilities. Buscemi goes AWOL, but somehow becomes a hero. Than you have to see Willis meet his fatal ending. It really sucks to see Willis die in anything. Plus, was it just me who notices that there space outfits change colors all the time while they're up in space? I don't know what they were thinking when they did the last hour or so of this film, but it seems like there were two directors and screen writers on this film. This movie is headed into history as being a great disaster film and turns into just a fun movie to watch for a while. Bruckheimer has yet to find anything as good as Top Gun still. I give this movie a 6 out of 10.",6,0,1,13 July 1999
Dark City," Possibly the best science fiction movie since Terminator 2.
","This movie is truly incredible. Alex Proyas had already gained much appraisal for The Crow, a movie that I didn't like, so I doubted all the hype for this one when it came out (boy was I surprised). This was right up with Saving Private Ryan last year as the best movie in 1998. In fact, this movie was so good that it spawned off two 1999 summer movies that were also loosely based off of multiple universes (The Matrix and The Thirteenth Floor). If you aren't a typical fan of science fiction, this movie may need to be watched more than once to get the full affect (like in 12 Monkeys). Rufus Sewell does an excellent job as the lead role, but in most cases, anybody probably could have played the role. Kiefer Sutherland is always excellent and shows no difference with his role as the mad-doctor type. Jennifer Connelly is barely noticed and is merely an attractive woman playing a transparent role. William Hurt remains the most boring actor in Hollywood, but doesn't have enough lines to bring the movie down. The real point is that it would be truly impossible to knock this movie down. The graphics are incredible and are balanced with the best background construction since Dick Tracy. The darkness is constant but brings the dark beauty that is so cool in this movie. While the story is great and is very unique, it may be very hard for many to truly understand the movie at a first setting. This may explain why many viewers complained of boredom in the theater. Dark City was just truly awesome and should be viewed by any science fiction buff or movie watcher. This movie has a chance to be a rental classic. I gave it a perfect 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,9 July 1999
"Girl, Interrupted"," The teen-bopper's 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'
","Renting this movie, I was expecting the typical nutcase/heart warmer and that about sums it up. Ryder has once again failed to take over the movie and keeps her name on my list of underachievers in Hollywood. Jolie takes over as psycho-Lisa and while the rest of the characters are believable, you don't really get to learn about any of them except Daisy, who is out of the joint before the halfway point. I still don't understand the relationship between Susanna(Ryder) and her parents. 'Don't worry mom/dad, I'll just forget that you led me to the nuthouse and didn't even drop me off, but paid a taxi'. For a self-rightous woman, Susanna gave in pretty easily into signing the papers getting her into the clinic. Overall, the movie was alright, but didn't seem to want to find an ending. Plus, the ending seems to be done quickly and actually becomes only the 2nd in what could be 3 different endings in the movie. That was cool in Waynes World, but not here. 5 out of 10.",5,3,4,14 June 2000
Speed," A perfect example on how special effects have become more important than plot.
","When I first saw Speed in the theaters, I thought it was average at best. Then I saw it about every other day on cable and I've found that this it is even worse than I originally thought. The only good thing to come out of this movie is that it put Keanu Reeves on a top list of Hollywood actors and enabled him to do great movies like Devil's Advocate and The Matrix. This movie is totally based on the materialistic wants of today's young audience and completely ignored realistic plots or even a plot at all along with down-playing the abilities of Jeff Daniels and Dennis Hopper. I did a report in school on the 51 things in Speed that couldn't possibly happen in real life and in fact, the whole plot by Hopper is impossible at the beginning. When Reeves receives that phone call, he could've easily phoned the bus services in L.A. and had them call the victimized bus before it reached 50 miles an hour. Even without all that, the fact that Reeves made halfway across L.A. in 10 or so minutes is bulls**t, just ask anyone who lives there. Reeves does ok, but shows nothing of what he's capable with in the future, which makes it even more surprising when he does those future movies. This movie is what made Sandra Bullock and why I don't know. She's not gorgeous and she has little acting ability. Any cute girl with a little wit could've played the part. Dennis Hopper has the best role in the movie and does as good as he can with the lousy script he has. Hopper remains one of the least used talents in Hollywood. Why is Jeff Daniels in this movie? Daniels was in this movie for no reason accept to get his name in there. What a sad waste of talent. None of the bus passengers show anything accept average abilities and when the bitchy lady dies halfway through, I feel bad because I'm happy about it. This movie has a few neat scenes and is ok to sit through the first time. Hopper and Reeves are enough to watch for a while, anyway. I give this movie a 3 out of 10. It is probably the most overrated movie in the 1990's.",3,8,19,13 July 1999
The Matrix," The most action packed SciFi film since Terminator 2.
","If you asked me what my opinion of Keanu Reeves was five years ago, I would've told you that he sucks. Now, thanks to the Devil's Advocate and now The Matrix, I think he's one of the most exciting actors in Hollywood. The Matrix is an incredible movie that will please all science fiction fans along with action movie addicts. The best part of all is the fact that it also happens to be a great story that never drags and keeps you saying, DAMN!!! Reeves does an excellent job as a computer hacker who finds out that he is the 'chosen one' to free all human kind. Laurence Fishburn delivers as his mentor and whoever made those sunglasses for him to wear, deserves an oscar nomination in costume design. Hugo Weaving is also a big part of this movie's success, playing a brilliant Agent Smith and is the coolest looking federal agent that I've seen in a long time. The action is non-stop and the martial arts escapades are brilliantly done. The story reminded me of the scare in the Terminator. In fact, that may be the only flaw in the movie is that the script seems to be a slight rip-off of the Terminator series and Dark City, both of which were better movies. Still, I very much recommend this movie, because it is the best movie that I have seen in 1999. I give it a 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,9 July 1999
