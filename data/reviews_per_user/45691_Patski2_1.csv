The Ring," I'll never watch an unlabeled videotape again!!
","Let me start by saying, I'm not one to be unnerved by scary movies.  I don't believe in the supernatural.  The usual horror fare (Scream, Halloween, etc) doesn't phase me in the least.This is hands down the most scary movie I've ever seen.  I watched this movie alone in a hotel room and I did not have a very good night.
It's not a hack-em-up, gross-things-jump-out-at-you sort of movie.  It builds a sense of fear from the start and keeps building it right to the last scene.  This movie scares you in the way the original Shining or Blair Witch did.I'm not a self proclaimed movie critic and won't go into a long dissertation on the sound, lighting and camera angles used to make this film so scary. I'll just leave it at  this:This movie really disturbed me. If you like to be scared out of your wits and made to feel uneasy for days by a movie, its a must see.  If you don't like scary movies, its DEFINITELY not for you.",Null,1,1,18 March 2003
