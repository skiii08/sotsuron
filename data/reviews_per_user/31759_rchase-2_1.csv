Come and See," Perfect for bright teenagers
","Have been showing classic films to teenagers for eight years and I've found no other film that leaves such a strong emotional impact on them. Their reaction is mainly due to it's subjective, vivid use of visuals, and its technique of showing war through a young person's eyes.  I've found no other film about WW2 so compelling.  Film seems to have had an big influence on Speilberg, especially the more dynamic sequences of Private Ryan and Schindler's List. Ryan's 'going deaf' sequence (losing the sound) was probably lifted from this film.(a hommage?)  Highly recommended for bright young students who need an emotional high and need to become excited about dynamic film-making. It's harrowing- as anti-war films should be. Even better, it squashes thoroughly all romantic, heroic ideas about war.",Null,3,5,1 May 2001
