Blade Runner 2049," Ehh not too bad
","Basically this was a movie about A.I. Robots called replicas living with humans together in a futuristic world. Sounds cool doesn't it? It does, but the movie definitely doesn't meet the definition. If you haven't seen the original, I would recommend you watching it first before this. In my opinion you should watch Blade Runner Final Cut. That movie is basically a remake of the original. It is still the original Blade Runner, but it looks better and the story is explained in more detail. Now there are these humans called blade runners that basically hunt down the replicas that are acting on their own will causing trouble. Ryan Gosling who is the blade runner, finds out more about himself throughout the movie, with memories of his mysterious past. This was more of a thriller and suspense movie, rather than a action movie. It does keep you interested but nothing special.Thus not being a classic hit like it should've been. It is not necessary to watch. You can live without watching it.",7,0,3,2 January 2018
Training Day," One Word...Classic!
","First off Denzel Washington was amazing! This is truly one of his finest movies ever. You must watch this if you are a Denzel Fan! His portrayal of his role as a police officer is just simply amazing.This movie is straight up action, crazy thrills and a huge roller coaster like feeling! It is a classic police movie but with a bad boy twist. You will feel like a troublemaker but also a hero at the same time when you are done watching this! The movie shows how far people are truly willing to go for their life. Your eyes will never close for a single second because something interesting is always happening! Hey people love things always happening. Hands down simply amazing!",10,9,12,30 June 2015
The Hurt Locker," The Real War Experience
","This movie is just simply amazing...It blends Hollywood and documentary style so well together. It really shows both sides of the movie. The depth of this movie goes really deep but also keeps the action alive, giving it the Hollywood twist! The story of the movie goes slow and usually most people would get bored quick...not this one, even though it moves slow, the story is so compelling and deep that it keeps your mind so interested. You will get lost by the actions taking within this movie. It will keep you thinking during those few hours. The acting was also another level I haven't seen in a while. This movie definitely shows what war really is!",9,1,2,30 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars The LAST MOVIE
","I don't know how in the world you could like this movie...none of it made any sense at all...I don't care what movie you make, it has to make sense whether it is a sequel or not! The Star Wars franchise is literally over!The directors have changed if people didn't know. That is why the movie was totally different. I don't agree with changing directors during a sequel or there should've been some guidelines made. Rian Johnson the new director just did horrible! I can see what he was trying to do...he didn't want Star Wars to be another typical Star Wars movie and same story line. He tried to twist the movie and surprise viewers. Ehh Rian...you need a new job.There are so many stupid things in this movies. I will just explain three major scenes. Princess Leia floating in space to go back to the ship?!? Uhh no one can do that and she is not even a jedi...Then supreme leader Snoke just dying with the light saber turning on? How can he die that easily? They don't even explain who he was. Now Rey...Luke didn't even train her at all..There was no jedi training scenes. Nothing exciting or new things we could've seen.If you are going to change the whole movie completely then you shouldn't be directing it at all. You have to use some of the stuff that happened previously or just start a completely different movie. Start your own saga or version of Star Wars. The company did horrible allowing him to make such drastic changes...We should all protest about how they offended Star Wars! Never watch anymore movies related to Star Wars.",4,1,1,15 January 2018
Evil Dead," Perfection
","Awesome movie, fast paced and scary. I've seen a ton of horror movies and this one is just completely different. It is on another scale. It's like a horror movie on drugs.Other horror movies are very slow paced. It just freaks you out from time to time. This movie freaks you out from beginning to end. I was scared, just surprised about all the horror and blood. This was by far the bloodiest movie I've seen. Gives you chills and really shows horror non stop.If you are a horror fan, do not miss out. Other audiences not into this genre, give it a shot. You will not regret it.",10,1,4,10 October 2016
The Matrix," Mind Blowing!
","First of all the idea of the movie is just so perfect. This is what gives the Matrix the interest of watching..and it sure did pay off! Everything about this movie is perfect. The idea, visual effects and acting!So the idea of the movie is something that has never been shown before to cinema. Living in a computer system controlled by A.I. Using human bodies as batteries. Wow just reading that makes me want to run to watch this. The way the idea was shown is crazy perfect. How everything runs in the Matrix with agents and etc. I can't find anything wrong with this part of the movie.Second the visual effects...Now for this movie, things like the effects have never been done or shown before like this. Thus giving the movie such a praise and respect for the effects. All the martial arts fighting,shooting scenes and jumping off walls. Your eyes...will be stunned. Never will you forget those scenes in your life!Last was the acting, the cast for this movie was marvelous...MARVELOUS! Keanu Reeves, the main actor was superb. He portrayed his roll perfectly, a lone man searching for an answer. He captured that image by his great acting skills. Everyone else did a great part as well and second most credit to Laurence Fishburne. I can't name anyone else who could pull off a huge leader like roll in this movie. He really pulls off the 'godfather' look and acting in a cyborg computer mafia.Once again...MIND BLOWING!!!!",10,1,2,30 June 2015
Warcraft," Not so great...
",Warcraft was just blehhh...it was a movie where kids would love it. Anybody older or more mature wouldn't think this movie was great at all. The movie didn't have anything interesting to keep watching. If you don't know anything about Warcraft then you will be confused and just be totally lost. It didn't even explain the story. The movie itself didn't even really revolve around the game either. It was just whatever. There really isn't anything to review about this movie either. It's a movie where you will forget the next day. That's all I can really explain. So when you watch a movie where you forget the next day...then you wasted your time.Watch it with your kids. Nothing more than that.,5,1,2,9 October 2016
Gladiator," GLADIATOR! Strength & Honor!
","Of course this is a late review. This is for the younger people or the audience who hasn't viewed this amazing movie. The story line itself is just simply awesome. Also who doesn't want to watch a movie with Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott as the director. They both made and starred in many acclaimed movies. This movie was made in 2000 and is still better than other movies out there! It really explains about the Roman Empire and the power they had as well as their weaknesses. It shows that and it also doesn't sway away from the main story. It doesn't just show a man for revenge, it goes deeper about his life and honor. His role as a general and the responsibilities with the surrounding people. The cinematography can't be explained...there is too many positive factors! You will never take your eye off the screen! There is always a climax in every scene and it just goes on and on! Get ready to be amazed!",10,0,0,17 July 2016
