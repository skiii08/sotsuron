The Blair Witch Project," Scariest movie I ever saw...hands down.
","I saw the Blair Witch Project last night, and it's no lie when I tell you it's the scariest movie I ever saw, hands down.  The fear of the unknown completely scares you to death.  It was so life like, and so real...and that's what makes it so much worse.  I recommend this to anybody that doesn't mind being absolutely frightened, and doesn't mind losing a little sleep afterwards.",9,1,1,1 August 1999
Meet the Parents," Did I miss something?
","I thought the movie was funny, but not hilarious, by any means.  I really don't expect much when I go to movies, but I definitely expected more of a comedic masterpiece.  I didn't get it.  I thought a lot of the humor was dry.  There were a few times that I laughed hard...but I found myself looking at my watch often.  It's a decent movie.  A good rent...not worth the 7 bucks per ticket at the theater...with popcorn, nachos and reeses pieces adding up to 30 dollars.  Save your money and rent it in a few months for 3.",Null,0,0,31 October 2000
Spider-Man," Outstanding!!!
","This is easily one my favorite movies of all time...I've never watched a movie and been so excited before and after the movie.  The story was wonderful, the action was exciting and the effects were outstanding.  I don't remember the last time I saw a movie and got so caught up in it like I have with this.  If you want to have a great time go see Spider-Man!",10,0,0,6 May 2002
Final Destination," Holy ShiZnaP Batman!!
","Wow...awesome, awesome movie.  There are only a handful of movies that really scared me to death, and this was one of them.  It's one of those films that you're almost afraid to watch because you don't know what they're going to do...they sort of install that fear in you from the get go.2 words... BUS SCENE. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???????  I don't think I've jumped so much...and been so startled. Yikes.Definitely recommend it.",10,0,2,15 April 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Great for 1984
","I just saw the original for the first time in a long time, and I remembered it being a lot better!  It really set the stage for the rest of the movies in the saga, so I guess it was okay.  It being 1999, and seeing movies like Scream, it can be hard to watch a classic like Nightmare-1, because the acting, film, camera angles and effects are so much worse.  It's a must see for those that want to know how it all started.  I think the saga peaked 'dreamatically' at 3 and 4, and went back down hill again.",8,0,0,25 July 1999
