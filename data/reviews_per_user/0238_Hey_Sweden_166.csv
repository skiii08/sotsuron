The Blair Witch Project," A good & creepy modern fright flick.
","'The Blair Witch Project' can be seen as a movie along the lines of 1978's 'Halloween': it may not be original stuff (think 'Cannibal Holocaust', made approximately two decades before this movie, in this case), but it certainly popularized its particular sub genre, the 'found footage' sub genre, for better and for worse. This marvel of marketing deserves its props for one main reason, and that's the way it uses its low, low budget to its advantage, placing all of its horrors squarely inside the heads of its viewers, forcing them to use their imaginations to conjure up their own demons. The story hardly needs summarizing by this point, but suffice it to say that it presents itself as the 'real' footage of three student filmmakers who get lost in the wilderness of Maryland while investigating a local legend. What this viewer has to say, in his own personal experience, is that repeat viewings have helped him to appreciate it more than he used to. A large part of the appeal is the *very* rural setting, and the idea of being lost in this setting and having no idea where to go, possibly ending up going in circles, which would be an extremely distressing thought. Now, the largely improvised dialogue is no great shakes, but it does offer a realistic enough account of the way that humans under extreme stress may very well speak, alternating between sniping at each other and trying to bolster each others' spirits. Our three protagonists, played by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams, aren't entirely unsympathetic. The directors slowly increase the sense of menace throughout, with the last act naturally registering as the creepiest. Interview sequences at the beginning are definitely amusing. The arts and crafts displayed by our unseen antagonist(s) are genuinely striking, and do lead to my favorite line in the film: 'Rednecks aren't this creative!' Of course, the idea in this film of one character stubbornly insisting on documenting *everything* has already become a clich√©; while of course we wouldn't have the movie if this person weren't doing so, it's all too easy to understand how this would annoy other people. Overall, I realize I have been under-rating this for years (watching it late at night or early in the morning with all the lights off would create the perfect effect) - it does have good atmosphere - although *that* scene has always cracked me up, and that was before I even saw 'Scary Movie'. In the end, it does appear that assessments of 'The Blair Witch Project' usually do tend to rely on how one reacts - either it works for the viewer or it doesn't.

Vertigo," Hitch works wonders with this material.
","This tantalizing, intense, dreamy thriller is considered by some to be Alfred Hitchcocks' finest hour. It moves slowly, but at the same time it's absolutely hypnotic. Helped to a great extent by one of Bernard Herrmanns' best scores, Hitch and his excellent cast pull you right in and take you on a memorable journey. It's simply one of the best studies in obsession that this viewer has seen in a motion picture. Hitch begins the tale in high style, creating a LOT of potent atmosphere and a touching romance. His visuals are among his most innovative, with an incredible nightmare sequence devised by John Ferren.James Stewart is very likable as John 'Scottie' Ferguson, a police detective who has a traumatic experience after which he realizes that he's deathly afraid of heights. While recuperating, he meets up with an old school chum, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore). Gavin is worried about the mental state and behaviour of his young wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), and hires Scottie to shadow her and see what she gets up to. Scottie falls in love with the beautiful blonde, and becomes determined to help her face whatever demons are haunting her.'Vertigo' is one of those stories that works better the less the prospective viewer knows about the plot, so this viewer will refrain from rehashing any more of it. Suffice it to say, this devastating entertainment comes up with some pretty sharp twists and turns. The character of Scottie completely earns ones' sympathies, from beginning to end.Novak seems awfully aloof for a while, but while this story plays out, her performance starts looking better and better. Barbara Bel Geddes leads a strong supporting cast (Henry Jones, Raymond Bailey, Ellen Corby, Konstantin Shayne, Lee Patrick, Paul Bryar) as she plays the role of Midge, Scotties' loyal companion who still carries a torch for him.I've heard it said that 'Vertigo' only gets better with subsequent viewings, so I'm already looking forward to revisiting at some point in the future.Nine out of 10.",9,2,4,16 November 2015
Scarface," The world is yours.
","In this notorious 1980s update of the 1932 gangster classic, Al Pacino is tremendously entertaining in the role of Tony Montana. Tony is a lowlife sent by Castro's Cuba to North America along with much more decent, hard-working and honest Cubans. As an immigrant, he's determined to take the quickest route to wealth and success, no matter who has to get hurt along the way. With Manny Ray (Steven Bauer) as his constant sidekick, he works his way into the position of a reigning drug lord in Florida.It may be simply a matter of personal taste how one responds to this admittedly grim and utterly nasty ode to crime and pathological greed. Tony is absolutely nobody to admire (although his exploits have since gone on to inspire a number of gangsta rappers), and is pretty much as bad an antagonist as you can see in this sort of entertainment. He's crude, aggressive, foul-mouthed, and incredibly brutal.Yes, the film does go on for almost three hours, and yes, it amounts to almost three hours' worth of excess. But, as Tony's junkie trophy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer) says, 'nothing exceeds like excess'. Some viewers may find it over the top and an unrelenting exercise in repulsing the viewer, but this viewer found it a blast; he tried never to take it too, too seriously.There's tons of gunfire and tons of blood before this is over, not to mention some great production design, widescreen photography, and gaudy 1980s fashions. The soundtrack is another plus, with a haunting electronic score composed by 80s favourite Giorgio Moroder.As the saying goes, 'Scarface' is about 'as subtle as a sledgehammer', really driving home the point that, ultimately, crime doesn't pay.Pacino is commanding as always as the flamboyant main character, ridiculous 'Cuban' accent and all. His 'Say hello to my little friend!' moment has been a part of movie folklore for decades now. He's surrounded by very fine actors: Bauer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (as the impressionable younger sister of whom Tony seems unnaturally fond), Miriam Colon (great in two scenes as Tony's disapproving mother), Robert Loggia (who's terrific in his final scene), Harris Yulin, F. Murray Abraham, Paul Shenar, Pepe Serna, Mark Margolis, Michael Alldredge, etc. Richard Belzer appears briefly as an M.C. at a club.Trashy beyond belief, 'Scarface' is undeniably vivid and can boast a particularly exciting finale. It's far from filmmaker Brian De Palmas' best work, but it's certainly one of his best known.Even at two hours and 50 minutes, it rarely gets boring.Eight out of 10.",8,1,2,10 February 2019
Frost_Nixon," A riveting story.
","Director Ron Howard brings an appreciable cinematic flair to Peter Morgans' adaptation of his own stage play. It tells the true story of the disgraced former U.S. president Richard M. Nixon (Frank Langella), who is courted for a series of interviews by upbeat, likable British TV host David Frost (Michael Sheen). Nixon and his loyalists see this as an opportunity for him to repair the damage done to his reputation. Frost, on the other hand, is looking to gain some credibility from the venture. He's humiliated by the smooth, experienced politician at first due to not quite taking his own opportunity seriously enough. Obviously, the segment that will make or break the experience for Frost will be how the two men handle the topic of Watergate.This is fascinating, interesting stuff, especially for a viewer such as this who is not terribly informed on the subject. It's a good look into the machinations of both politics and TV journalism. A great film it is not, but it's solidly entertaining for just over two hours. One of the best things that it does is to put a human face on Mr. Nixon, who could, to some people, be written off as a mere cartoon sleaze ball. Even in the face of his misdeeds, it is possible to take some sympathy on this man whom many in the nation simply want to see confess and apologize.'Frost/Nixon' is one of those films for this viewer where any slickness on the part of the filmmakers takes a back seat - and rightly so - to the power of the material. It's brought to life by a superb cast. Langella and Sheen anchor the story with two very convincing portrayals, and Kevin Bacon, Matthew Macfadyen, Oliver Platt, Toby Jones, Patty McCormack (as Pat Nixon), Rons' brother & father (and frequent repertory players) Clint and Rance Howard, and Eloy Casadaos offer indelible support. Rebecca Hall is lovely and appealing as Caroline, a gal who catches Frosts' eye, but the character isn't really important in the developing plot of this film.A worthy viewing for some people, but surely it would have even more resonance for people who lived through this tale and remember the key players.Eight out of 10.",8,1,1,23 November 2015
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," If you like-a this movie film, you get a high five!
","It's-a very nice. Performer Sacha Baron Cohen keeps character comedy alive with this ingratiating, sometimes utterly outrageous film that does do more than just deliver belly laughs, as it takes its title character - a clueless, well intentioned TV personality from Kazakhstan who travels to the U.S. and A. to study its cultures so that the great and glorious nation of Kazakhstan may learn a thing or two. It exposes a variety of prejudices as lovable Borat interacts with a great many average Americans, finding that things aren't so ideal in his host country. Cohen is absolutely incredible as he stays in character no matter what the situation is, and priceless as he displays his ignorance of so many aspects of American culture. Among his travels, which do take on an episodic nature, he learns about American humour (NOT!), antagonizes the audience at a rodeo as he does his own version of the national anthem, makes friends with a prostitute (Luenell), and spars with his curmudgeonly, corpulent producer Azamat (Ken Davitian). Granted, Cohen does go to some pretty crazy lengths to get laughs, especially when he and Davitian have their climactic physical altercation. Still, he does generate some honest guffaws, which is more than can be said for some comedies. The best moments come when Borat is meeting with the assorted American citizens, and their reactions as they try to decide what to make of him are priceless. Part of the plot revolves Borat becoming infatuated with actress Pamela Anderson and travelling across country, from NYC to LA, with the intention of making her his wife, and this adds to the wacky appeal. One of the most refreshing elements to 'Borat' is its dispensing with anything resembling political correctness; too bad more mainstream comedies don't have this level of brevity. Cohen is a lot of fun (it's hard not to crack up simply seeing his face on the DVD cover), and Davitian makes for a great comic foil. While his brand of humour may not be for everybody, some viewers are sure to appreciate his dedication to his craft and love his go-for-broke, anything-goes attitude. The action moves along very well, and the film wraps up in record time, coming in at a very reasonable 84 minutes. It gets off to a great start, and remains amusing right to its appealing wrap-up.

Alien 3," Not deserving of so much hatred.
","Granted, the first two movies in this franchise would have been a tough act to follow, and this movie doesn't offer us much that we hadn't seen before, but it's still unfairly vilified in this reviewer's humble opinion. Story picks up as Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley crash lands on a truly desolate planet at the ass end of the universe, used as a prison facility populated by various unsavoury characters. Once again, a xenomorph must be battled, but we're going back to basics in a way, as it's only the one monster brutalizing individuals left and right in this case. David Fincher, making his feature directing debut here after having worked on music videos, maintains an incredibly bleak vision from start to finish. (It's certainly true that there are elements here that are going to come across as major bummers to some audience members.) The picture returns to the visual style of the first film in one sense in that the aspect ratio is once again 2.35:1. Visuals are appropriately stark and special effects are generally good; owing to the way this particular alien is brought into the world, its movement is even more animal like than usual and there is camera-work representing alien p.o.v. shots that is extremely striking. Now, it's true enough that with so many of the characters being lowlifes - no matter if they have found God - that it's hard to feel much whether they're alive or dead. There are exceptions, of course: Charles S. Dutton has a commanding presence as Dillon, the top con, and Charles Dance is given far and away the most interesting role in the whole thing as the medical officer with the dubious past and who makes a connection with Ripley. Lance Henriksen makes a token appearance reprising his role of the android Bishop (and has a second role as well), and the strong, mostly British supporting cast features capable performers such as Paul McGann, Brian Glover, Ralph Brown, Danny Webb, and Pete Postlethwaite. The screenplay, overall, (credited to Larry Ferguson and longtime series producers David Giler & Walter Hill) may be somewhat formulaic but the movie still delivers in a visceral way. What's recommended is seeing the two hours and 25 minute long assembly cut as it fleshes out the story and characters a bit more and it's a more intriguing experience than the theatrical version. While clearly this entry is not going to be for all series fans, it's got its moments, and at the very least starts off on a nice ominous note with its spin on the Fox Fanfare theme and its opening credits.

Gremlins," Memorable 80's product still packs a mean punch.
","I would consider this my favourite Christmas movie of all time. And if your tastes tend towards the dark, twisted, and subversive, and you enjoy a healthy amount of humour with your horror, I'm sure you consider this essential Christmas viewing as well.It was the brainchild of Chris Columbus, whose screenplay caught the attention of Steven Spielberg who then suggested Joe Dante as director. Spielberg had enjoyed both Dantes' 'Jaws' send-up 'Piranha', as well as 'The Howling', and the two had also directed segments of the previous years' notorious 'Twilight Zone: The Movie'. The story centres around bank teller and aspiring artist Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan), whose travelling salesman / inventor father Rand (singer / songwriter / actor Hoyt Axton) picked up an unusual Christmas present for Billy during a visit to Chinatown: a cute little fuzzy animal identified as a Mogwai, whom Rand christens Gizmo. Gizmo comes with a set of insane rules, which of course must be followed and which, naturally, are meant to be broken soon enough: he must not be exposed to bright light, *especially* sunlight, he must not come into contact with water, and he must not eat after midnight. Rule # 2 is broken, and Gizmo spawns a quintet of new Mogwai that prove to be absolutely incorrigible. When rule # 3 is broken (unknowingly), the new Mogwai become Gremlins (the name coming from WWII, when any machinery experiencing problems would be said to have 'gremlins' in it), little reptilian monsters that proceed to tear an idyllic small town to pieces.This continues to hold up on repeat viewings. Even if there are firmly dated aspects to the presentation at times (Mega madness!), it's still as fun as it ever was, with an endearing human cast in addition to the diminutive 'stars'. Galligan and sexy Phoebe Cates are an appealing lead couple, Axton and Frances Lee McCain are a delight as the parents, Polly Holliday is just a riot as the crabby, greedy local busybody Mrs. Deagle (a perfect '80s stand in for Mr. Potter from 'It's a Wonderful Life'), and Judge Reinhold a hoot as smarmy and ambitious bank vice-president Gerald. Superb supporting players include the *always* welcome Dick Miller as Mr. Futterman (who's reunited with his co-star from 'The Little Shop of Horrors', Jackie Joseph), Scott Brady, Edward Andrews, Glynn Turman, Keye Luke, Corey Feldman, Jonathan Banks, Harry Carey, Jr., Belinda Balaski, and The Real Don Steele, the real life D.J. who will be familiar to fans of New World productions from the '70s. Appearing uncredited are veterans Kenneth Tobey and William Schallert. Spielberg and composer Jerry Goldsmith make fleeting appearances which the viewer will want to watch for. The voice artists are all fun, including Howie Mandel as Gizmo, and ultra ubiquitous Frank Welker as Stripe; 'Police Academy' series sound effects guy Michael Winslow is also among this bunch.Excellent and highly enjoyable effects by Chris Walas and his team, Goldsmiths' irresistible score including that 'Gremlin Rag' main theme, and numerous in-jokes and visual gags add to the fun. The title characters are never less than entertaining - sometimes frightening, sometimes extremely funny - and one can't help but like these guys - after all, they can't be *all* bad when they like 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' so much. They kind of have the personalities of children, albeit children whose pranks have a decidedly sadistic nature. And when they raise Hell in a tavern, they're just as obnoxious and destructive as any human drunks. The scene with McCain dispatching three of the monsters in her kitchen justifiably gave the movie its reputation. It's show stopping stuff, although the business with the microwave (not to mention Cates' priceless story of why she dislikes the Christmas season) did rub a fair amount of people the wrong way. And when all is said and done with this movie, there is a very blatant yet effective message about learning to be responsible.Followed by a sequel six years later, 'Gremlins' would prove to be so successful - and merchandise friendly, no doubt - that it would get a theatrical re-release, and lead to a number of other imitative comedy / horror movies about little monsters - 'Critters', 'Troll', 'Ghoulies', 'Hobgoblins', and their sequels - but leads the pack by far.Nine out of 10.",9,1,3,5 December 2011
Antz," All star voice cast brings this to life.
","Woody Allen lends his distinctive voice and personality to the role of 'Z', a lowly worker ant in an ant colony. He's become awfully tired of his inconspicuous, drab existence, and the idea of living only to follow orders. He becomes smitten with the colony's princess (voice of Sharon Stone), and in order to impress her, switches places with his soldier pal Weaver (voice of Sylvester Stallone), and inadvertently becomes a war hero. But what he really wants is to find a fabled 'Insectopia'; he must also expose the nefarious plan of a general named Mandible (voice of Gene Hackman).Written by Chris & Paul Weitz, with Todd Alcott, this is a funny and clever animated comedy from Dreamworks and PDI, the company that hit it big with the 'Shrek' series. It does have a message about the benefits of thinking and acting for oneself, but it wouldn't really be for the youngest of viewers in one's family. There is some mild intensity and language. It would indeed have the most resonance for Allen fans, although the whole cast is well utilized. Other celebrities voicing characters are Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin as a pair of wasps, Anne Bancroft as the Queen ant, Danny Glover as a soldier ant, Jennifer Lopez as a worker named Azteca, John Mahoney as an old barfly ant, Paul Mazursky as Z's psychologist, Christopher Walken as a loyal colonel, and Grant Shaud as a foreman.There's enough slick animation, visual effects, and action sequences to make it all pretty fun, along with good music by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell. Some grandiose gags involve the comparative size of ants to humans, as Z and Bala discover a picnic spread. People are sure to love the character designs, and be amused by the philosophical exchange between a mosquito and a beetle.Solid entertainment, overall.Eight out of 10.",8,1,2,26 March 2017
Mission: Impossible III," A fine entry in this ongoing series.
","Tom Cruise again essays his continuing role of super-agent Ethan Hunt, here tasked with rescuing a protege (Keri Russell) who managed to get herself kidnapped. It turns out, this plot point is just the tip of the iceberg, in a typically extravagant action-adventure spectacular that has Ethan doing battle with a dastardly black-market arms dealer, Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman). For Ethan, the whole operation hits way too close to home when the bad guys kidnap his new bride Julia (Michelle Monaghan), who has no idea what he really does for a living.J.J. Abrams stepped aboard as the third director to tackle this franchise, giving us our money's worth and then some. The story probably wouldn't hold up to a lot of scrutiny, but at least with movies like this, they entertain you so thoroughly you're not given that many quiet moments to ponder how insane all of it is.Naturally, there is some first-rate, amazing stunt work, as well as the expected pulse-quickening action scenes, and plenty of explosions to hold our attention. The story does have the requisite number of twists and turns. For example, its opening two minutes just grab you right away, although we can sense that this sequence is actually from much later in the tale.Cruises' star charisma (and physical prowess) are on full display here, and he's aided and abetted by a very strong supporting cast: Laurence Fishburne, Billy Crudup, Ving Rhames, Maggie Q, Simon Pegg, and Eddie Marsan. The radiant Monaghan is appealing as Hunts' wife. And since movies such as this are dependent on the effectiveness of the villain, Hoffman admirably fills the bill. He's just incredibly cold-blooded and controlled. Aaron Paul of 'Breaking Bad' fame has a small part.What helps the storytelling is that Abrams and his screenwriters introduce a level of humanity, as we get to see Hunt off the job for once. He truly believes that it's possible for someone in his line of work to have a normal, healthy relationship, although his co-workers doubt this.Solid stuff overall, and indicative of how the series has continued to flourish, despite its lacklustre second entry.Eight out of 10.",8,1,1,16 August 2018
Requiem for a Dream," The kind of film one experiences more than they 'enjoy' it.
","'Requiem for a Dream' is an adaptation of a novel by Hubert Selby Jr., with a script credited to Selby and director Darren Aronofsky. It basically spins a yarn about the utter horror of lives ruined by drug addiction, focusing on four pathetic characters from Coney Island. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is an aged couch potato, dreaming of TV stardom, who gets hooked on diet pills. Her son Harry (Jared Leto) and his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are determined to make a big score; Marion (Jennifer Connelly) is Harry's girlfriend.Right from the start, it's clear that this will not be a conventionally told narrative. Aronofsky leans heavily on quick cuts, and a wealth of imagery. In fact, his film is stylized to the point of utter insanity. It's definitely not to all tastes, and spends so much time having the characters wallow in misery that it inevitably comes as a relief when the film ends. It's that potent. It does take a while to grab hold, but holding it together is Burstyn's incredible performance. This viewer thought that her character was the most sympathetic, even in her delusion. All four leads deliver compelling performances, but hers is truly something special.The supporting cast features a number of familiar and reliable actors: Christopher McDonald (as a motivational speaker), Louise Lasser, Keith David, Mark Margolis, Ajay Naidu, Peter Maloney, Dylan Baker; Selby appears on screen as a laughing guard.Selby and Aronofsky play all of this with grim conviction. At no point did this viewer really believe that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel. There are moments in this that are truly bizarre (like hallucinations involving a refrigerator), making the whole film take on the tones of an absurd nightmare.Not necessarily an 'entertaining' film (at least, not in any conventional sense), but it is very effective in what it does.Six out of 10.",6,0,2,13 February 2020
Captain Phillips," Extremely well-crafted.
","Tom Hanks stars as Captain Richard Phillips, commander of the Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship that got raided by pirates in 2009. The pirates in this case are Somalis led by the intense Muse (newcomer Barkhad Abdi), who are looking for a payday substantial enough to justify their efforts. Despite all attempts made by the ship to throw off the pirates, they do get on board, and they manage to get off again holding the Captain as a hostage. Soon, the military has intervened and the situation actually gets even more stressful for our hero / victim.Director Paul Greengrass does appear to be something of a stickler for realism. Although we are assured that this true story did receive some dramatic embellishment for entertainment purposes, it does feel fairly true to life. We get to see cool heads prevail as the ships' crew turn the tables on the pirates at times, but not every event will swing in their favour. Commendably, the pirates are not rendered as one-dimensional bogeymen, but very determined individuals who don't seem to have a lot of options in life. (Their boss, a warlord, clearly isn't the kind who will take failure lightly.) As a result, we see a rich gallery of characters, several of them based on real people, acting as human beings and not infallible superheroes.While there is enough subtext going on to make this more than a mere action-thriller, rest assured that Greengrass and company absolutely do NOT skimp on the thrills. 'Captain Phillips' has plenty of genuinely riveting and exciting sequences, with first-rate editing (by Christopher Rouse) and pacing to make up for any flaws that viewers may perceive with the script or execution. The films' second half often takes place inside the cramped lifeboat, and kudos to the filmmakers for their excellent job at cranking up the tension within closed quarters.Hanks is solid as usual, offering a level-headed and pragmatic lead performance. The three men playing Muses' compatriots have great energy, and the supporting cast includes such familiar American faces as Catherine Keener (in a brief cameo as Phillips' wife), David Warshofsky, Corey Johnson, Chris Mulkey, Yul Vazquez, and Max Martini.Based on a book that Phillips wrote with Stephan Talty; text at the end details the fate of the two main characters.Well worth a viewing.Eight out of 10.",8,0,1,8 August 2018
3:10 to Yuma," Not always logical or probable, but the acting makes it a must see.
","This modernized second adaptation of the Elmore Leonard short story stars the reliable pair of Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. Bale plays Dan Evans, a Civil War veteran turned rancher who's going through some difficult times. He's deeply in debt, so he seizes upon a chance to make some money. The job is to watch over a notorious outlaw, Ben Wade (Crowe), and eventually help to escort him through the desert, so he can make it to a train depot and thus be transported to prison. The outlaw, however, has other ideas in mind, and does his best to mess with the ranchers' head, while his scruffy gang relentlessly pursues the posse.The 2007 version of '3:10 to Yuma' may not always make sense (some reviews have pointed out admitted holes in the plot), but technically it's wonderfully made, and in some ways it has the feel of a classic Western. The widescreen photography is beautiful, and the location shooting (mostly in New Mexico) likewise impresses. Director James Mangold does a fine job telling an entertaining and riveting story, succeeding at maintaining viewer interest for the better part of two hours.The primary asset is a well chosen and exemplary cast. A charismatic Crowe and sincere Bale offer low key, nicely nuanced performances; Wade may be a bad man, but you can't help but like him to some degree. Evans, who's stuck with a sullen teenage son (Logan Lerman) who doesn't respect him, feels the need to prove himself worthy. The women, Gretchen Mol and Vinessa Shaw, end up with very little to do, unfortunately, but actors such as Peter Fonda, Dallas Roberts, Kevin Durand, and Alan Tudyk are a pleasure to watch. But it's Ben Foster who tends to steal the show in his role & performance as Charlie Prince, the most ruthless member of Wades' gang.Best recommended to fans of the actors involved.Eight out of 10.",8,1,2,3 March 2016
The Hangover," Has its moments.
","To be honest, after the way this movie has been built up, I couldn't help but feel some disappointment as it wasn't as flat out, falling down funny as I was hoping for. That's not to say that there aren't very lively moments, and some genuine laughs to be had, but this isn't really that great. Still, its tremendous success is impossible to deny; obviously it was a crowd pleaser. What it does benefit from is a set of enthusiastic performances by its star trio: Bradley Cooper as Phil, Ed Helms as Stu, and Zach Galifianakis as Alan, as three guys helping the about-to-be-married Doug (Justin Bartha) have the last great wild time of his life in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, what happens is, on the day after, they have no memory of the Hell they raised. All they've got are the end results: a tiger in the bathroom, an adorable infant on the premises, a hotel room in ruins, a missing tooth, Stu's apparent marriage to a stripper named Jade (Heather Graham, looking as foxy as ever), a stolen police car...and, most importantly, the disappearance of the groom. So they're obliged to solve the whole mystery of the night before, with often wacky results. Just to give you an idea, boxing icon Mike Tyson, playing himself, turns up, showing his appreciation for Phil Collins's 'In the Air Tonight'. Some sequences work better than others - among other things, the three guys find themselves roped into participating in a tasing demonstration, and are pursued by a vengeful character named Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). Todd Phillips, who gave us such other comedies as 'Road Trip' and 'Old School', is director of these nutty shenanigans, and the gags keep coming right through the end credits, as we finally get to see, through snapshots, bits and pieces of the kinds of things that the guys got up to. Overall, this is certainly lively stuff, with enough chuckles to make for fine viewing, and making the city of Las Vegas a character in its own right, but for this viewer couldn't quite measure up to its reputation.

Raiders of the Lost Ark," 'I don't know...I'm making this up as I go.'
","It's a testament to the entertainment value of this adventure classic that its approximate one hour and 56 minute run time just flies by. Whether one is revisiting it or experiencing it for the first time, it flows along extremely well, maintaining a high level of excitement and populating its diverting story with a rich array of memorable characters. Today it remains a career highpoint for its filmmakers and much of its cast.Concocted by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas (with official story credit going to Lucas and Philip Kaufman), and scripted by Lawrence Kasdan, it takes its inspiration from the movie serials of decades past, and goes them one better in terms of its thrills and chills. Harrison Ford stars as 1930s archaeologist / professor / adventurer 'Indiana' Jones, to whom we're introduced in a marvellous opening set piece set deep in the Peruvian jungle. He ends up hired by the American government to locate and obtain the mystical Ark of the Covenant before Adolf Hitler and his minions can get their slimy hands on it.He's accompanied by a wonderfully feisty leading lady, Marion Ravenwood, played to perfection by the appealing Karen Allen. Among Indy's friends are museum curator Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Egyptian digger Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), and among the enjoyably devilish bad guys are charming rogue Belloq (Paul Freeman), a ruthless rival archaeologist, a cold blooded Nazi officer, Dietrich (Wolf Kahler), and an incredibly creepy interrogator, Toht (Ronald Lacey). It's also fun to see a young Alfred Molina, in his film debut, as the Peruvian guide in that opening sequence.Even if the viewer is thoroughly familiar with the film by now, there's still lots of enjoyment to be had in viewing the assorted iconic scenes: Indy pursued by a runaway boulder, the confrontation in the Nepal bar, the chases through the streets of Cairo, the fight near the Nazi plane, one of the best vehicle chases to be seen in cinema, and that final scene where the power of the Ark is unleashed. There are certainly macabre moments to be found throughout, but this merely adds to the sense of danger and the sense of fun constantly being created by Spielberg and associates. The efforts of a first rate crew - production designer Norman Reynolds, art director Leslie Dilley, cinematographer Douglas Slocombe, editor Michael Kahn, etc. - are supplemented by eye popping special effects supervised by Richard Edlund, nifty makeup effects by Chris Walas, and of course that hummable rousing theme music by John Williams that can stay in your head long after the film is over.Overall there's plenty of pizazz and humour in the presentation that continues to make this top notch escapism. This was a favourite of this viewer as a child and it's lost little of its appeal 30 plus years later.Followed by a prequel, two sequels, and the 'Young Indiana Jones' TV series.10 out of 10.",10,2,4,5 January 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Still very effective 32 years later.
","Steven Spielbergs' beloved alien encounter classic truly touches a nerve. How many of us who experienced this film as a child came away completely unaffected? It's ultimately a touching story of childhood innocence, devotion, and friendship; the friend in question just happens to be an alien being. Beautifully acted by its principals - and, yes, that should include E.T. himself, who's brought to life by a talented effects crew - this sometimes funny, sometimes a little spooky, and always heartfelt story, scripted by Melissa Mathison, still has the ability to move this viewer who's now seeing it from the perspective of a 41 year old adult.John Williams contributes another of his majestic, iconic music scores, the cinematography by Allen Daviau is excellent, and Spielbergs' storytelling savvy is at its peak. This film moves forward extremely well, and the one hour & 55 minute run time pretty much flies by.An alien botanist gets stranded on Earth when his spaceship leaves without him; soon, he's discovered by troubled youngster Elliott (Henry Thomas), who does everything in his power to hold on to his new friend and provide for him in any way that he can. He knows that if word got out, that adults would just want to exploit and examine the poor creature. Fortunately, E.T. is sufficiently intelligent to be able to figure out a means of contacting his home planet, so it becomes a matter of spiriting him away so the rendezvous can take place.This viewer will admit that as a child he just felt like bawling at the finale, but even at this age, his eyes didn't exactly remain dry. There is a fundamental sweetness and charm to all of this that helps it to hold up after all this time. Tellingly, adult characters are very minimal in the mounting drama, save for the always appealing Dee Wallace as Elliotts' mother Mary and Peter Coyote as the basically well intentioned government agent known only as 'Keys'. Drew Barrymore is adorable and natural as the sister and Robert MacNaughton is fine as older brother Michael. That's C. Thomas Howell as Tyler and Erika Eleniak as the girl in the science class.This remains among the best of Spielbergs' filmography and is worth introducing to each successive generation.10 out of 10.",10,2,4,24 May 2014
It," What, is, It? It's It! What is It?
","The second adaptation of Stephen Kings' epic-length novel tells the story of seven put-upon pre-teens, living in a small American town called Derry. In the summer of 1989, they discover that all of the towns' children are in danger of being devoured by an ancient, vile entity residing deep underground. Most often, it takes the form of a clown named Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), but can assume the shape of anything that its victims fear the most. These seven kids band together in the hope that they can vanquish this monster.As a fan of the novel who's read it cover to cover a few times, what takes some time getting used to is the fact that Kings' often very specific details and time frames are altered for the current tale being spun. Also, very little of the dialogue from the novel is left intact. Still, the filmmakers, led by director Andy Muschietti ('Mama') do get some things right - visually the film does play like images and pages from the novel come to life. The 'Barrens', in particular, look much how I imagined them when reading the novel.Compared to the first adaptation, the TV miniseries back in 1990, this is often more genuinely creepy, and that's a word that may recur to the viewer while watching this. While there is some faithfulness to the source material (the house on Neibolt Street, the leper, etc.), the filmmakers do make up some of their own stuff, such as a painting that understandably freaks out Stan (Wyatt Oleff). In contrast to original Pennywise Tim Curry, who alternated between truly goofy shtick and being a monster, Skarsgard is pretty much just plain Evil.The film is definitely well cast overall, though. As befitting a variation on a King work, the strongest asset is the young cast, their appeal as characters and their camaraderie. Sophia Lillis is a standout as Beverly, the strongest member of the group. This young lady is definitely going places. Finn Wolfhard of the Netflix series 'Stranger Things' has some amusing lines playing Richie, the comic relief of the group. Unfortunately, Stan and Mike (Chosen Jacobs) don't get that much to do. By making Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor) the newcomer to town who is obsessed with its history, the film robs Mike of his most potent defining characteristic.All in all, the film tells an entertaining story in capable enough fashion, although it would be true that it doesn't have an exorbitant amount of tension, and sometimes gets by on usage of jump scares.It's a mixed bag, with a rather underwhelming finale, but it does work a fair amount of the time.Regarding the 1990 version, it tended to go downhill when it told part two with the Losers as adults, and one wonders if the sequel to this will suffer the same fate. Time will tell.Seven out of 10.",7,1,2,15 March 2018
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," I must admit, I haven't read the novel.
","By several accounts here, the movie is a travesty compared to Seth Grahame-Smiths' novel, which is odd considering that Grahame-Smith himself wrote the screenplay. The movie ultimately isn't about nuance but turns into a full-blown, over the top, cartoon-like action- horror movie. It's definitely fun to a degree, but one does have to 'turn their brain off' before watching. At the least, it puts a highly amusing genre spin on events in American history.It turns out that Americas' 16th president was more than the man who freed the slaves. He was also the man that fought the vampires that were scheming to overtake the country. In a hilarious contrivance by the author, the entire Confederate army is composed of savage bloodsuckers. But I'm getting ahead of myself. The movie introduces us to the young Lincoln, who witnessed his mother being attacked by a vampire. He wants vengeance, and ends up mentored by mysterious Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper). Honest Abe (sincerely portrayed by Benjamin Walker) then sets out on a mission to destroy all creatures of the night.Admittedly, this movie may lose some viewers by the nature of its action set pieces, the first being a horse stampede and the other an overdone finale on a train. The rampant CGI may take them out of what is an interesting curiosity otherwise. Director Timur Bekmambetov does manage to create some poignant moments amid all the lunacy, while still doing his damnedest to prevent the audience from getting bored. Production design and cinematography do give this a nice comic book sort of look. The cast gives admirably straight faced performances, with Rufus Sewell, Marton Csokas, and Erin Wasson as villains, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Mary Todd, and Anthony Mackie and Jimmi Simpson as Abes' friends.All in all, 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' is no great shakes; at times it's not really distinguishable from other action-horror mashups, but it still might intrigue some genre fans, and history buffs who won't be offended by the concept.Seven out of 10.",7,0,1,18 October 2013
In Bruges," Funny, poignant, genuinely interesting.
","Playwright Martin McDonagh makes an assured feature filmmaking debut with this witty and generally amusing combination of dark comedy, sobering drama, crime picture, and travelogue. The Bruges of the title is a Belgian city with a real storybook quality and which is a magnet for the tourist trade. Hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) have been sent there on orders from their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) after a job has been botched and a young boy accidentally killed. They're instructed to take in the sights - which Ken is more than happy to do - while awaiting further orders. But Ray is grumpy and bored and thinks that spending time in Bruges is like spending time in Purgatory. Audiences accustomed to loud and fast action films may possibly find this to be just as dull as Ray finds Bruges, but some may also consider this to be a rather interesting breath of fresh air. It's very dependent on character and situation, and working from McDonaghs' script, the three principal actors do excellent jobs creating well rounded individuals who may be in a morbid line of work but who each have their own moral code. Among the assorted episodes of the story, Ray romances a free spirited local named Chloe (Clemence Poesy), makes the acquaintance of a dwarf named Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), gets briefly menaced by Chloes' associate Eirik (Jeremie Renier), roughs up a loud mouthed Canadian guy (!) portrayed by Zeljko Ivanek, and learns the truth about why he and Ken were sent to Bruges in the first place. McDonaghs' dialogue is sometimes surprising and often quite funny; he gives the material an impressively un-P.C. flair. There are spurts of bloody violence here and there, but what the writer / director often sets out to do is actually subvert the conventions of typical crime gone wrong flicks, even coming up with a way to avoid the kind of shootout one might normally see in this sort of thing. Beautiful photography and scenery are of course a credit to the film; the city does become a character in its own right. The music by Carter Burwell is superb at setting the mood. The three leads are terrific, with Fiennes showing a winning aptitude for comedy, and Farrell and Gleeson definitely managing to win our sympathies. They help to make this nicely offbeat film worth seeking out for movie lovers who get tired of more formulaic fare. Recommended. Seven out of 10.",7,0,3,28 December 2012
John Wick," Not bad, but you know what to expect.
","Slick, stupid, senseless action entertainment stars Keanu Reeves in the title role. Wick is a former assassin whose wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan, in a thankless role) dies from an unspecified disease. The lonely and distraught Wick receives a final present from her one night: a beagle puppy named Daisy. Soon, Russian creeps led by the infantile Iosef (Alfie Allen) break into his home, steal his car, and beat Daisy to death. Now Wick has nothing left to live for but revenge, and he goes after the Russian mob - his old employers - with a ferocious tenacity.This viewer felt about as bad as he could for Mr. Wick, given that the characters - all of them, really - are thinly written. While it provides some visceral joy watching this force of nature unleash his fury on a non-stop parade of thoroughly expendable action movie villains, there's not that much humanity. The guy wades through henchmen so quickly that he turns into the kind of superhero too often seen in this genre. Fortunately, he does take *some* lumps before this is over, and at one point it looks as if it might be curtains for him.There is a ton of violence, and a ton of digital splatter, although not very much that would be likely to seriously gross out some viewers. The pacing is definitely of a very deliberate variety, until the story - such as it is - begins to take off. While all of this is mildly amusing, 'John Wick' doesn't really do anything that we haven't seen before in scores of action-revenge sagas.Keanu is once again a figure in minimalist 'acting'; in his one attempt to truly emote, he does his best, but he's still not that convincing. Ian McShane and John Leguizamo are thoroughly wasted in cameo roles; Willem Dafoe gets a little more to do. Swedish star Michael Nyqvist offers some fun as the mob boss. Allen is such a weasel that he can't die soon enough. Adrianne Palicki, like Nyqvist, is entertaining enough as a persistent would be hit woman. Other familiar faces include Lance Reddick, Dean Winters, Daniel Bernhardt, Randall Duk Kim, Clarke Peters, Kevin Nash, and the always welcome (if much too briefly seen) David Patrick Kelly as the leader of a team that cleans up peoples' messes.'John Wick' is an agreeable enough, but also forgettable, way to kill 102 minutes.Six out of 10.",6,3,8,11 July 2015
Chinatown," One of the best for both Polanski and Nicholson.
","'Chinatown' is an absolutely intoxicating mystery set in 1930s Los Angeles where private detective Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is hired to keep an eye on a water and power executive and finds much more going on than he'd anticipated. Faye Dunaway is his femme fatale, aloof socialite Evelyn Mulwray, in screenwriter Robert Townes' delicious ode to the crime fiction of authors like Hammett and Chandler.Many details add to the enjoyment of this intricately plotted story; what's so great about it is that we discover things along with Jake and aren't able to figure out where it's going next. The story also has a very grim quality to it, one that's actually cyclical in nature as it's suggested that actions that had previously resulted in tragedy are being repeated. Then again, people may not expect just how grim this gets in the end. Additionally, it features some revelations that are particularly twisted and which the viewer is not likely to forget. There's one character who will especially make ones' skin crawl.Many riveting scenes and confrontations play out while everything gets lovingly and beautifully lit and photographed; period recreation is also strong. Director Roman Polanski guides all of it with a sure hand, getting superb performances out of his well chosen cast. A large amount of familiar faces appear - Perry Lopez, Dick Bakalyan, Joe Mantell, Bruce Glover, Diane Ladd, John Hillerman, James Hong, Beulah Quo, Roy Roberts, Noble Willingham, Rance Howard, Jesse Vint, Burt Young, and Lee de Broux, but standing out and delivering a very grandiose performance is the always welcome John Huston. Polanskis' cameo as the hood who slashes Jakes' nose is also a treat.By the end, the separate threads are tied together and Jake realizes that all of his best efforts don't amount to that much; he's unable to prevent the worst from happening. Still, this film offers a compulsively watchable journey on the way to its destination, remaining believable and interesting all the way. Even as it gets very serious, it doesn't miss opportunities for humour, and it entertains solidly for two hours and 11 minutes, rating as one of the most potent examples of the 'neo noir' genre.10 out of 10.",10,4,7,2 November 2012
Train to Busan," All aboard!
","Yoo Gong plays Seok Woo, a workaholic father who hasn't been enough of a presence in his daughter Soo-ans' (Soo-an Kim) life. Still, when she yearns for a trip to visit her mother, he agrees, determined to do right by her for a change. But the journey by train is like a sprint through Hell, as an undetermined virus is infecting SCORES of Korean people. It's up to a select few, including father and daughter, to survive and make it to Busan, which is supposedly something of a safe zone.'Train to Busan' is sometimes cartoonish and over the top, and does go on longer than is really necessary. The amount of time it takes for the virus to infect a bitten person varies depending on the needs of the screenplay. And writer / director Sang-ho Yeon isn't averse to succumbing to genre clich√É¬©s, such as the one cowardly individual who will throw others to the wolves in order to buy himself more time. Fortunately, the director serves up a satisfying smorgasbord of carnage, and often gets by on pure showmanship. He also makes sure that the scenario retains its humanity, never letting the horror get completely out of control. His characters may sometimes be ridiculous, but he does give us some heroes for whom we can root. The performances range from reasonably sturdy to frenzied, and as a leading character Seok is a little unconventional, because he actually teaches his daughter to always look out for # 1 first, rather than be compassionate.Pretty slick filmmaking and generous doses of gore help to keep this from ever getting boring, plus Dong-seok Ma (the expectant husband Sang Hwa) is a fairly amusing badass type of guy.Seven out of 10.",7,10,23,6 February 2017
Citizen Kane," An incredible debut for an undeniable young talent.
","Orson Welles made his extremely well regarded filmmaking debut with this interesting and compelling example of cinema. It's the fascinating, highly atmospheric yarn of Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles himself), a young man who comes into a lot of money and decides that his main goal in life will be to run a newspaper (the Inquirer). Over time, he becomes a major publishing magnate, and even throws his hat into the political ring. But there are some things that he will never quite be able to overcome, such as his hubris, and his inability to admit when he might have been wrong.'Citizen Kane' is noteworthy for the way that it moves forward and backward in time, as a reporter named Thompson (William Alland) is among those who research Kanes' life story. As the film opens, Kane has just died, and journalists are determined to unravel the mystery of his final uttered word: 'Rosebud'. Yet, the film is never hard to follow. You always do have the proper sense of time and place. Welles' storytelling abilities are in full bloom, and he keeps his viewers utterly engrossed, as he is assisted by a rich gallery of characters and actors to bring them to life. The high-strung Bernstein (Everett Sloane) was a particular favourite of this viewer.But the entire cast, with principals comprised of members of the Mercury Theatre, has their moment to shine: Joseph Cotten as the drama critic, Ruth Warrick as Kanes' first wife, Dorothy Comingore as his second wife, Agnes Moorehead as his mom, Ray Collins as the slimy politico Gettys, etc. And Welles is fantastic as the enigmatic character at the centre: a complex, flawed, but compelling individual whose influence stretched far and wide. He wasn't a one-dimensional picture of integrity - he starts out with morals and ideals, and they slowly melt away - and a viewer can see how a person like this might one day have it all and then lose it all the next day.This begins on a wonderfully ominous note, and features striking cinematography by Gregg Toland and excellent music by Bernard Herrmann. Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz wrote the utterly absorbing story, which won the sole Oscar among the nine nominations. And a young Robert Wise was the editor; his contribution cannot be overstated.A film like 'Citizen Kane' might not be everybody's cup of tea, but serious cinema buffs are advised to check it out. They won't be disappointed.10 out of 10.",10,0,2,13 May 2019
Darkest Hour," Better if taken as an actors showcase.
","Gary Oldman finally picked up a (most deserved) Best Actor Oscar for his sterling work here. Acting under makeup and prosthetics, Oldman delivers the goods as the legendary 20th century politician Winston Churchill, a man who certainly had a gift for orating. As the film begins, it's the 'darkest hour' of WWII, and hopes are severely diminished against the ferocious onslaught of Hitlers' military forces. The public has decided that current Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) is not cutting the mustard any more, and makes it clear that they want change. Churchill is offered his job, and learns that by accepting it, he will have to accept that people have little faith in him. He will have to earn their trust.Ultimately, the film is better seen as a showcase for its wonderful cast than as a story. It ends just when it's getting interesting, and it would have been nice to have seen more of an assessment of Churchills' overall achievements. As it is, it often focuses on Churchills' confrontations with indignant associates, who think that there are already strikes against him in his past history. Yet, we do get some sense of the heavy weight that this man bore, as he took every setback and all casualties to British forces to heart.Assisted by his makeup team (who also brought home Oscars), Oldman is able to completely disappear into this role. You won't recognize the actor, but you'll be struck by his ability to engage the viewer, and get them involved in the story. The supporting cast is equally strong: Ben Mendelsohn as King George VI, Lily James as Churchills' sometimes overwhelmed typist Elizabeth Layton, Stephen Dillane as Viscount Halifax, Samuel West as Sir Anthony Eden, David Schofield as Clement Atlee, etc. However, Kristin Scott Thomas gets precious little to do over the two hour five minute run time, as Churchills' devoted wife Clemmie.In the end, this is typical filmmaking, in which events are either dramatized or fictionalized entirely, which once again just goes to show you that with movies, you sometimes just have to take them with a grain of salt. Not that I know many people who really expect an accurate depiction of history with this sort of thing.Seven out of 10.",7,1,2,1 April 2019
Underworld," Shows its audience a reasonably good time.
","Out of the blue, a hunky average-Joe hospital intern named Michael (Scott Speedman) is targeted by beings who turn out to be 'Lycans', or werewolves. It turns out that there's been a war waging between Vampires and Lycans for centuries, and Michael's caught up in it because the Lycans have taken a keen interest in him. The Vampire who begins protecting Michael on a regular basis is the tough-as-nails Selene (a black leather clad, super sexy Kate Beckinsale). She also must deal with the traitorous Kraven (Shane Brolly) and Lycan head honcho Lucian (Michael Sheen).Admittedly, some of the gadgets here are cool. Each side has devised special bullets guaranteed to mess up opponents badly. Director Len Wiseman serves up a lot of fast and furious action, and the kind of rapid cutting common to so many modern films of this kind. Beckinsale looks exquisite while kicking ass, and Speedman is sure to get plenty of hearts fluttering himself. All of that said, it's hard to care very much about the characters for quite a while, until Wiseman starts giving the actors more dramatic moments. Even then, the film looks and feels drab, with characters struggling to keep their emotions in check. The heavy reliance on digital technology, unfortunately, turns too many of the effects into cartoons. (Not that this is surprising; 'Underworld' was obviously done to have a comic book sort of approach.) The werewolves, in particular, look pretty bad. This is dark, rainy stuff with atmosphere to spare (this was filmed in Hungary), slick to a fault, but never very involving. Perhaps the most interesting aspect is the 'things are not as they seem' plot twist, although some viewers may charge that they saw it coming well ahead of time.Beckinsale and Speedman are nicely supported by a talented bunch of actors. Sheen is charismatic, Bill Nighy has excellent screen presence as head Vampire Viktor, and Sophia Myles has plenty of sex appeal herself in the role of Erika. Brolly isn't so hot, however; his reaction to hearing some 'shocking' news is priceless.Screenplay by actor Danny McBride, with story credit going to McBride, fellow actor Kevin Grevioux (both of them also have roles in the film), and director Wiseman.Followed by three more 'Underworld' features.Six out of 10.",6,1,2,7 October 2017
Kickboxer," Feeling so good today!
","There's no reinventing the wheel with this straightforward martial arts / vengeance themed potboiler, one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's earlier starring vehicles. The Muscles from Brussels plays Kurt Sloane, the younger brother of a champion fighter named Eric (Dennis Alexio). We can see right away that Eric's success and resulting overconfidence will be his downfall, and so it goes when Eric is permanently crippled by reigning Thai kick boxer Tong Po (Michel Qissi), a truly scary and creepy m.f. Of course, Kurt swears revenge, and learns that the one person who MIGHT train him is reclusive Xian Chow (Dennis Chan).There isn't anything inherently wrong with sticking to a formula, and writer Glenn A. Bruce and co-directors Mark DiSalle and David Worth throw absolutely no surprises into the mix. As with many movies of this ilk, there is some charm to be found in the performance of the person playing the trainer, and Chan is both amusing and likeable. So is upbeat, engaging Haskell V. Anderson III, playing an expatriate American in Thailand who lends a helping hand - sometimes reluctantly. Rochelle Ashana is gorgeous as the requisite love interest / eye candy. And Jean-Claude is as affable as he's ever been. Qissi is a purely formidable villain who the writers and directors make sure is always proving just what a bad guy he is.Thankfully played with some humour, as well as an enjoyable (if moderate) amount of gore and violence, 'Kickboxer' is pretty good fun, if not all that memorable. It does push buttons in an effective manner, putting characters in peril as well as including a canine companion for Xian. One funny moment has Xian give Kurt some raw meat to carry while running so the dog will chase Kurt and make him move faster. The fight scenes are staged by Jean-Claude himself and are suitably rousing. But the best part of all has to be when Xian prods Kurt to get on a dance floor so he can check out his sense of balance. Jean-Claude's dance moves are most amusing.Overall, solid entertainment for fans of the genre and the star.Seven out of 10.",7,0,0,6 July 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The Force is with me. I am one with The Force.
","'Rogue One' functions as a bridge between Episodes III and IV in this ongoing 'Star Wars' film series, telling the story of the ambitious plot to obtain the plans to the armored space station The Death Star and hopefully find a weakness. A character named Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) is recruited by The Rebel Alliance because it was her father Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) who helped to design the damn thing. Even after Jyn learns from a hologram of her father that it does in fact have a weakness (that he deliberately contrived), the RA won't lift a finger to help her. So she goes 'rogue' with various soldiers, a Rebel spy (Diego Luna), a smart alecky droid (voice of Alan Tudyk), and an Imperial defector (Riz Ahmed).While it is true that the script isn't without flaws, 'Rogue One' is a spirited enough adventure. We don't really get to know characters that well, but they possess a basic inherent rooting factor that does help. Director Gareth Edwards handles the scope of the material quite well, and this viewer, for one, didn't feel that his pacing was too sluggish. The expected abundance of CGI was actually fairly impressive, for the most part. The action steadily builds towards an ultimately large scale battle in space that is satisfying.Best of all, it's nice to see Darth Vader in full bad ass evil villain mode, even if his screen time is limited. Governor Tarkin is also brought back, using the digitized rendering of the image of the late Peter Cushing, and this effect turns out better than expected, if not perfect. Various nods are made to characters and details from Episode IV, such as those characters who pick a fight with Luke in the cantina.It really does throw you off at first, not hearing that familiar, majestic John Williams theme OR seeing an expository crawl at the beginning. (The score by Michael Giacchino isn't bad at all but it's nowhere near as memorable as anything Williams composed.) Fortunately, once the story kicks in, this becomes a solidly entertaining viewing experience.The performances from the international cast are decent. Tudyk is amusing as a droid who doesn't ACT much like a droid; he has a sardonic, sarcastic personality. Forest Whitaker is over the top as an extremist character who really doesn't serve much of a purpose.All in all, 'Rogue One' shows the audience a fairly good time, right up until its conclusion designed to lead right into the opening of Episode IV.Seven out of 10.",7,3,12,11 August 2017
Lords of Dogtown," 'He's competing with the Sun for centre of the universe.'
","This film charts the rise of the legendary 'Z-Boys' of California: Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk), Stacy Peralta (John Robinson), and Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch). After they go to work for board designer Skip Engblom (Heath Ledger), they pioneer a new style of skateboarding that wins them lots of success and acclaim. Of course, as is often the case, this fame is not without some costs. Stacy (who wrote the screenplay) emerges as the most even-keeled of the trio, while Tony gets a fairly swelled head.'Lords of Dogtown' will surely resonate most for those people who came of age and forged their friendships in the 1970s, as well as all aficionados of the sport of skateboarding. For this viewer, it took a while to really grab hold, because it suffered from some excess. There's more footage than is really necessary of characters indulging in various forms of bad behaviour. Fortunately, as we actually see some humanity and humility from some of the principals, the story becomes more engaging. The hyperactive camera-work and quick cuts are distracting at first, but it's hard to argue with a soundtrack as cool as this one. There's one great rock song of the era after another. The moves performed by the actors' stunt doubles do provide some pretty good thrills.The cast is fine and full of familiar faces: Rasuk, Robinson, and Hirsch are very well supported by Ledger, whose colourful performance is most welcome, and performers such as Rebecca De Mornay (always nice to see her in anything), Johnny Knoxville, William Mapother, Julio Oscar Mechoso, Nikki Reed, Pablo Schreiber, Elden Henson, Michael Angarano, Mitch Hedberg, America Ferrera, Sofia Vergara, Charles Napier, Bai Ling, Shea Whigham, Joel McHale, and Alexis Arquette. The real Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, and Jay Adams have cameos, as does Tony Hawk; Jeremy Renner appears unbilled.Overall, a decent snapshot of the L.A. skateboarding and surfing scene throughout the 1970s, with text at the end telling us what became of the principals.Peralta also directed the documentary feature 'Dogtown and Z-Boys'.Seven out of 10.",7,2,2,6 November 2018
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," An amiable romantic comedy.
","Writer / star Jason Segel here gives himself a plum part as Peter Bretter, a composer who wastes his time doing music for a cheesy TV series. He was dating the female star of the series, the titular Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), but she has dumped him in favour of a tragically hip rock star, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). In order to try to get over the breakup, he takes a vacation to Hawaii - only to realize that Sarah & Aldous will be staying at the same hotel. The balance of Segels' story has him becoming attracted to the friendly hotel desk clerk (Mila Kunis), while doing his best to move on with his life.The characters become more endearing as the story plays out, in what is typical but engaging fare for the Judd Apatow company. It has its fair share of raunchy gags (Segel, a braver man than I, actually opens and closes the film with some full frontal nudity) and silly moments. But, for the most part, it actually takes the tale fairly seriously, making its characters flawed and recognizably human, but still appealing, and not total cartoon caricatures. It seems to be built on a somewhat formulaic foundation, but at least it keeps its viewers watching and attentive.Granted, a big part of the appeal is some gorgeous on-location shooting in Hawaii, which adds an exotic enticement to the proceedings. Along the way, there are some hilarious digs at 'C.S.I.' and David Caruso, and some priceless musical moments - 'Dracula's Lament', 'We've Got to Do Something', etc. And the gags continue during the closing credits, as one more shot is fired - this time, at 'Ghost Whisperer'.Segel acquits himself nicely in the lead, but then so do many of the cast members. Bell and Kunis also look absolutely ravishing, needless to say. Brand is a hoot as the self-absorbed Snow. Co-stars include Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Liz Cackowski, Maria Thayer, Taylor Wily, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, and Da'Vone McDonald. The cameos in the TV-shows-within-the-film are a hoot. What's nice is that so many people here get a chance in the spotlight, with Segel and director Nicholas Stoller giving them some effective comic moments.In general, this is not a genre that this viewer actively seeks out, but he heard some good word of mouth on this one, and he was glad that he gave it a try.Seven out of 10.",7,0,1,24 February 2019
12 Angry Men," A masterpiece of acting and filmmaking.
","Brilliant film version of the televised play, scripted by the plays' author Reginald Rose, and produced by Rose and leading actor Henry Fonda. It's fascinating and compelling, offering memorable showcases to an amazing ensemble. The basic story is solid, but more than that, it's a nice look into a rich variety of characters, each with their own background and reasoning. It's all the more impressive for being a young Sidney Lumets' filmmaking debut; he makes this a highly charged, atmospheric experience.An 18 year old teenager is on trial for murder, and the jury has retired to discuss the case. When things start out, 11 men are ready to convict the boy, and there's one holdout, juror no. eight (Fonda); Fonda doesn't necessarily believe the boy is innocent, but he's passionate in his belief that there's enough *reasonable doubt* in the matter to refrain from voting guilty. He encounters a fair amount of hostility at first, particularly from the excitable juror no. three (Lee J. Cobb), but as the night falls and a storm starts up, he wears down his fellow men a bit at a time, insisting on bringing up facts that he felt weren't adequately explained during the trail.What's so wonderful about '12 Angry Men' is how believable it all is, right down to one juror, the baseball loving juror no. seven (Jack Warden) being willing to change his vote just to get the hell out of there, and the earnest juror no. 11 (George Voskovec) admonishing him for not doing this for the *right* reason. Each actor gets their own chance in the spotlight, and they're all superb. Cobb has the most intense role as a truly stubborn man who's gotten himself personally involved in the case; Ed Begley is equally potent as juror no. 10, another holdout. Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Joseph Sweeney, and Robert Webber fill out the rest of this powerhouse cast.While the story is quite good dramatically, it's not without some humour, some of it coming from adman Webber. Use of music is sparing, which only adds a sense of realism to the proceedings. One of the most striking moments is when most of the group turns their backs to Begley after he launches into a rather disconcerting rant.Overall, this does deserve to be considered one of the finest American films of all time.

","'Green Room' is a decent enough thriller starring Anton Yelchin, Joe Cole, Alia Shawkat, and Callum Turner as the members of a punk band named The Ain't Rights (or the Aren't Rights, if you prefer). One night, they're the musical act at an isolated night club catering to Neo Nazi skinheads. Before they can leave, they are witness to a murder, and the people running the club have confined them to a room so that they can deal with the problem in their own way. The Ain't Rights will then be forced to deal with the evil club owner, Darcy (the great Patrick Stewart), and his unrelenting minions.This viewer wasn't as blown away with this movie as some people, feeling that while the situation was reasonably riveting and the pacing very good, the story and the characters are mostly pretty thin. It was hard to care about what would happen to our protagonists or how things would get resolved. In addition, the villains seemed to be pretty sloppy individuals.The movie is somewhat redeemed by acceptable action sequences, and some highly enjoyable violence & gore. Pat, played by Yelchin, gets his arm f'd up badly at one point. There are also some very nice torn throats thanks to the attack dogs employed by the thugs.The cast does manage to be engaging. The real-life fate of Yelchin was truly sad; he does alright here, and likely had a solid career ahead of him. Imogen Poots is fine as Amber, a bystander who finds herself imperiled along with the band members, but this viewer was particularly taken with Ms. Shawkat. Classing up the joint considerably is the always terrific Stewart, who's an effectively soft spoken criminal mastermind.Entertaining stuff, although it doesn't really live up to the reputation it has, not for me, anyway.Six out of 10.",6,4,9,7 December 2016
The Rocker," Rock 'n' roll comedy does have some laugh out loud moments.
","After achieving fame on the TV series 'The Office', actor Rainn Wilson here shows himself capable of carrying a feature film, in this vehicle. It's got some heart as well as some degree of silliness, and it doesn't conclude as well as one might like, but it does do its job, and keep entertaining the viewer for a well paced 103 minutes.Wilson indeed is playing the kind of part one could also easily see Jack Black playing: Robert 'Fish' Fishman, wildman drummer for Vesuvius, a rock band on the rise, whose bandmates cruelly kick him out just before what could have been a life changing event. He spends the next 20 years bearing a grudge and deeply resenting his lot in life when an opportunity presents itself. Fish's nephew Matt (Josh Gad) is keyboardist for a high school band named A.D.D., and they need to replace their drummer in time for the prom.In record time, this band begins to take off, and the members - also including singer / guitarist / creative force Curtis (Teddy Geiger) and bass player Amelia (Emma Stone) - find themselves having to deal with a crazed Fish desperate to live out all the decadent rock 'n' roll dreams he never got to realize before.Ultimately, this is a pretty, if not entirely, predictable affair. At least it doesn't act as if a romance between Fish and Curtis's hottie mom Kim (Christina Applegate) is inevitable. It goes utterly over the top in the early going (that bit with the incensed Fish pursuing his Vesuvius bandmates is priceless), but for most of the rest of the picture, it's a little more down to Earth.Wilson proves to be fearless (witness the naked drummer routine) and delivers a performance of true enthusiasm. His castmates are equally appealing. Jeff Garlin has his moments playing Fish's brother; also co-starring are Jane Lynch, Jason Sudeikis, and Howard Hesseman; it's hilarious to see Will Arnett, Bradley Cooper, and Fred Armisen in long hair wigs as they portray the other members of Vesuvius (and affect ridiculous faux English accents near the end). Appropriately enough, Pete Best, the man infamous for being the drummer fired from the Beatles, has a cameo.Overall 'The Rocker' is likable enough and amusing enough to qualify as agreeable entertainment while it lasts. It may not be terribly memorable, but it is quite easy to take.Seven out of 10.",7,2,2,1 June 2013
The Babadook," The Babawhat?
","This decent if somewhat over praised modern psychological horror film stars Essie Davis as Amelia. Amelia is a single mother raising six year old Samuel (Noah Wiseman) by herself because the husband / father died while trying to transport Amelia to the hospital in the first place. Now Samuel is acting very strangely, insisting that he's interacting with the terrifying spectral beast of the title. His troubling (to say the least) behaviour leads her to start really losing her mind, which has already been in a fragile state ever since hubby's death.This viewer found it a little too hard to care that much about these main characters, and the basic story is rather average. Yes, writer / director Jennifer Kent does deserve some credit, for choosing to go a mostly traditional route in terms of horror. She creates a mood, and an atmosphere, and some genre fans will be pleased to note that, for the most part, she eschews the use of excessive gore. She's also smart to keep her villain shadowy and vague and barely seen; while this approach might not appeal to some horror devotees, this viewer thinks that, often, the less he knows about the antagonist, the better. Lastly, Kent never allows special effects to overtake any drama, keeping them to a minimum.The performance from leading lady Davis certainly reveals a deep sense of commitment. Granted, her histrionics come off as a little much, but she absolutely does not phone this performance in. She gives it her all. Little Wiseman is pretty impressive, and appealing through it all.Overall, a good watch, not a great one.Six out of 10.",6,0,4,2 May 2015
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," This movie has warped my fragile little mind.
","This is a hysterical feature film version of the enduringly popular animated Comedy Central series, set in a peaceful 'redneck mountain town' where not much happens. That is, until our youthful heroes - Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny - go to see the new movie featuring their favourite Canadian entertainers, Terrance and Phillip. They are inspired by its toilet humour and extremely profane dialogue, and start repeating it whenever they get the chance. This, in turns, inspires their mothers to start an anti-Canada movement that will culminate in war between the U.S. and Canada, and the execution of 'war criminals' Terrance and Phillip.What's great about the Trey Parker / Matt Stone creation is that they are able to stay true to their raunchy, profane style while also delivering what is a pretty sharp satire of real-life attitudes. It's true that we're ALWAYS looking for somebody to blame when problems occur, and usually don't do that much to actually solve the problems; it's easier to just single somebody or something out and publicly excoriate them / it.This results in a movie that is pretty intelligent in its own way, and gives us all the irreverence we came to expect from the series. Parker & Stones' dialogue (they and Pam Brady are credited with the script) is of course priceless in its inventive use of vulgarities. The production values are naturally higher than one would see in a series episode, and a lot of the animation is quite slick and stylish.The characters are as engaging as they've ever been. Cartman in particular is still the foul-mouthed, cranky brat he's always been, and in the end he is able to put his talent for profanity to great use. One devastating touch is having Satan figure into the plot - a forlorn Satan who can't relate to his goof ball lover Saddam Hussein.Ultimately, this is ideal entertainment for fans of the series, and is also good enough to allow Parker & Stone to reach an even wider audience than usual; you realize these guys are real talents.A raft of celebrities supply additional voices (in addition to the late series regular Isaac Hayes, who voiced Chef); I'll leave you to discover them for yourself.Eight out of 10.",8,0,0,24 February 2019
Balls of Fury," Better to die like a tiger, than live like a pussy.
","Created by the same people behind the TV series 'Reno 911', 'Balls of Fury' is really no ball of fire, but it passes the time amiably enough. Alright, so it IS pretty stupid. But it's not exactly aiming high in the first place. Some jokes do get dragged out too long, and there are awkward moments. Still, as it clocks in at just over an hour and a half, it doesn't go on any longer than it should. At its best, it does generate some modest chuckles here and there.The cast is really more engaging than their material. Dan Fogler stars as Randy Daytona, a star ping-pong player at age 12 who gives up the game for 19 years before being persuaded to pick it up again by Federal agent Ernie Rodriguez (George Lopez). The Fed needs Randy to infiltrate a tournament presided over by arch-criminal Feng (Christopher Walken, at his most Christopher Walken-esque). It turns out that the bad guy is an avid ping-pong fanatic.Working as a spoof of both action movies and sports movies, 'Balls of Fury' is agreeably silly at times. Its characters are reasonably endearing and entertaining, and it's hard to knock a story (written by co-star Thomas Lennon, who plays the swaggering Kraut Karl Wolfschtagg, and director Robert Ben Garant) with an affection for the music of Def Leppard.Lots of familiar faces here: Maggie Q as the luscious (and badass) love interest, Terry Crews, Robert Patrick (don't be fooled by his prominent billing; he's barely in the thing), Diedrich Bader, Aisha Tyler, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Jason Scott Lee, David Koechner, Patton Oswalt, David Proval, Masi Oka. But it's the legendary character actor James Hong who steals the show, in a gem of a comedic performance as the blind, Mr. Miyagi-like mentor. Walken, unsurprisingly, is a hoot as the villain.Of course 'Balls of Fury' is no modern classic, but sometimes a 'good' no-brainer comedy is just what some people look for to pass the time. It's certainly not as terrible as it's been made out to be.Six out of 10.",6,2,2,31 July 2018
Hot Fuzz," Fun follow-up to 'Shaun of the Dead'.
","Director / co-writer Edgar Wright, star / co-writer Simon Pegg, and co-star Nick Frost turn their attention to a new series of genres with this similarly engaging send-up: mostly, the buddy-cop movie, although it also functions as a murder mystery and even has a feel of the slasher movie at times. Pegg is wonderful as Nicholas Angel, a young man fiercely dedicated to law and order, even when it has cost him the love of a woman. His bosses tire of him, realizing he's so damn good he makes everyone else look bad, so they pack him off to a small country village named Sandford. Angel's keen eye for suspicious detail leads him to believe that there's a mad plot underneath the tranquil surface of this supposedly peaceable community. He makes friends with local officer Danny Butterman (Frost), who becomes his partner through thick and thin as the bodies pile up and the blood splatters everywhere. Wright gives the movie a great over the top feeling, what with the various gruesome and outrageous methods devised to knock off characters. Now, the movie does go on just a bit long, and 'ends' more than once. This prevents it from being as much fun as it could and should have been, but it's impossible to dislike a movie that pays such earnest homage to the classic corpse littered action escapism of the 1980's and 1990's, with references to 'Supercop', 'Silent Rage', 'Lethal Weapon', 'Die Hard', etc., and points out the joys of jumping sideways while firing a gun with each hand. The references to 'Point Break' are particularly delicious. And that's not to mention the absolute necessity of coming up with a witticism when messily dispatching a bad guy. There's another absolute joy to the proceedings, in seeing scores of people who aren't exactly young handling all manner of weapons. Also, if you've ever thrilled to scenes of 'preparing for battle' seen in favourites like 'Commando', you get treated to that sort of thing here. Pegg is both hilarious & endearing in the lead, with very nice support by the likable Frost. It's delightful to see a whole bunch of distinguished British acting veterans actually having a real ball with the material, including Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, Billie Whitelaw, Paul Freeman, Stuart Wilson, Timothy Dalton, Paddy Considine, Rafe Spall, Edward Woodward, and Kenneth Cranham (with Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan, Peter Jackson, and director Wright making uncredited cameos). Dalton in particular is a total hoot. The characters are never less than entertaining, and the movie does have a definite wild energy and a lot of flashy cutting. The soundtrack is cool and there are a respectable amount of laughs to be had in watching this clever comedy, which does have some fine character moments amid all of the murderous mayhem.

Constantine," Two hours in Hell with Keanu Reeves.
","The film star here at least gets a role in which being monotonous is not such a bad thing. In this adaptation of the 'Hellblazer' comic book series, John Constantine (Reeves) is a detective of sorts, dealing in the supernatural - dispatching demons, that sort of thing. He meets a young female detective, Angela Dodson, played by the beautiful Rachel Weisz. Angela's twin sister has committed suicide, and this serves as a catalyst for apocalyptic goings-on, as Angela, like her departed sibling, has had the ability to see strange things for many years now. Soon John, who has been to Hell and back, is battling the forces of darkness once again. Director Francis Lawrence unfortunately doesn't bring a lot of life to this nightmare story. The fact that it's as dreary as it is is actually acceptable given what kind of story it is, but it's kind of hard to care too much about the characters. There is some humour, but it's often of the dark variety, keeping in tone with the balance of the movie. The people who deserve the most credit are those creating all of the morbid visuals. One thing that can be said about 'Constantine' is that it *looks* just great, with superb art direction, set decoration, cinematography, and various practical and digital special effects. However, these elements can only help so much as this film overall feels too familiar. Granted, it's got some good ideas, like using water as a conduit between worlds. And it does get better as it goes along, with a delicious confrontation between John and Satan himself, played with his typical flair by Peter Stormare. The supporting cast is extremely effective, with Tilda Swinton cast as the renegade angel Gabriel, Pruitt Taylor Vince as the frightened Father Hennessy, singer Gavin Rossdale (of the rock group Bush) as smooth and dapper villain Balthazar, the magnetic Djimon Hounsou as the character Midnite, and comedy relief provider Shia LaBeouf as John's sidekick Chas. The movie is generally quite oppressive, and it's easy to see how it could divide its viewers into 'love it' or 'hate it' camps. This viewer felt that it had its assets, but couldn't overcome a general lethargy. Four out of 10.",4,0,3,6 August 2012
Ed Wood," A treat to watch.
","Certainly one of director Tim Burtons' very best films, 'Ed Wood' takes an unlikely candidate for the feature film biography treatment: Edward D. Wood, Jr., a man who at least had the distinction of being voted the worst filmmaker of all time, and who had given us a movie that has been cited as the worst movie of all time, 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'. Mr. Wood wasn't bursting with talent, and worked with minuscule budgets, but he didn't let these things stop him from making the movies that he wanted to make.Now, this isn't all-encompassing as a biography; it doesn't go into Woods' origins or childhood, basically focusing on his career. We see him as he starts on the stage and soon works his way into the motion picture business, choosing a project (to become 'Glen or Glenda') that was near and dear to his heart. From then on, it's fascinating to watch as he goes through the process of filming another classic howler, 'Bride of the Monster', and the notorious 'Plan 9', and comes to be good friends with the drug addicted and impoverished horror icon Bela Lugosi.It's to the credit of Burton and crew, such as production designer Tom Duffield and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, that this movie has such a wonderful look. Shot in black & white, 'Ed Wood' is a delight in the way it takes us back to '50s era Hollywood and the prospect of shooting low low budget efforts back in those days. The story is compelling and just draws the viewer right in. Wood is an easy character to like; Johnny Depp is completely convincing as the man whose passion exceeds his abilities.But Martin Landau and Rick Baker truly take your breath away with the way they bring Bela Lugosi to life. Landau immerses himself in the role, and Bakers' makeup is so perfect, that one can forget that they're watching a performance and totally buy that this is Lugosi. Both men definitely deserved the Academy Awards that they won as a result.The entire cast makes vivid contributions, with many familiar faces on hand - Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller (Woods' girlfriend when we first meet him), Patricia Arquette a new acquaintance who becomes his wife, Jeffrey Jones the phony, priceless psychic Criswell, Lisa Marie as TV horror host Vampira, George 'The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson, Brent Hinkley as Conrad Brooks, Max Casella as Paul Marco, and Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge. (There are also cameos by the real Brooks, as a bartender, and Gregory Walcott, the hero of 'Plan 9', as a potential backer.)The scene where Wood runs into none other than Orson Welles (a very good Vincent D'Onofrio) is a true gem, especially when Welles bemoans the impositions made on him regarding his film 'Touch of Evil'.We don't really learn that much about Wood by the time the movie is over, but it's entertaining enough to make up for that. A funny, and sometimes profane, script, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, helps, as does the obvious affection Burton has for his subject, right down to the way the opening credits are done. Fun music by Howard Shore is another heavy asset.Anybody who enjoys old movies, B pictures, movies about filmmaking, or likes recreations of Hollywood from decades past is sure to get a real kick out of 'Ed Wood'.Eight out of 10.",8,0,0,11 April 2012
Home Alone," 'You guys give up, or are ya thirsty for more?'
","Eight year old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin, in his appealing break through lead performance) is frustrated enough with his family to 'wish them away'. And he gets this wish, sort of, when the entire family - parents, siblings, aunt & uncle & cousins included - is in such a rush to get to the airport in time for a trip to Paris that they leave him behind. At first, he has great fun with his temporary freedom and independence, but will eventually have to save his house from being burgled by a bumbling pair of oafs, Harry and Marv, played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. This he does by staging an elaborate series of booby traps.'Home Alone' is a pretty charming little family comedy that does have quite a bit of heart to go along with all of the farce and slapstick. This material is indeed pretty funny, with Pesci and Stern playing their slow witted lowlife criminals for all that they're worth; some of their facial expressions and reactions are just hysterical. Some of it may be a bit much, and may not jibe that well with the more serious portions of the movie, but it's doubtful many kids watching are going to care that much.It does, in the end, make a very good case for the need for family, how we're perfectly capable of taking our loved ones for granted, how to deal with one's fears and do some growing up, and in the case of Old Man Marley (the excellent veteran Roberts Blossom), how it's never too late to mend relationships. The wonderful scene between Culkin and Blossom in the church where they make a connection is indeed the best moment in the entire picture. Kevin's been administered (erroneous) warnings about the old man's supposedly sordid past, and is understandably afraid of him, and realizes how one shouldn't be too quick to believe that sort of thing.Lovely funny woman Catherine O'Hara also does extremely well in the role of the mother willing to do anything that's humanly possible in order to atone for what she feels is an unforgivably stupid mistake. It's truly a treat to see her reunited with 'SCTV' co-star John Candy, who's as engaging as ever in his cameo role as polka star Gus Polinski. John Williams supplies an expectantly catchy score and touching song (both Oscar nominated, with song lyrics by Leslie Bricusse).Good fun overall, with a bright wrap- up, it's not surprising that the movie would have been such an enormous hit over 20 years ago, and it continues to entertain today.Seven out of 10.",7,1,1,6 December 2011
Insomnia," This is definitely one to catch, folks.
","Al Pacino is first-rate as an L.A. homicide detective named Will Dormer, dispatched (along with his partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan)) to Nightmute, Alaska. They're going to assist an old friend, Chief Nyback (Paul Dooley), with a recent homicide up North. But they're also being distanced from controversy back home, as both detectives are currently being hounded by Internal Affairs.As it happens, figuring out who killed the victim won't be that difficult. ('Insomnia' isn't really trying to be a whodunit.) The problem arises during pursuit of the suspect, Walter Finch (Robin Williams), and Finch starts playing a cat-and-mouse game with the weary veteran Dormer. Dormer is further hampered by the fact that in this locale, the sun doesn't set during this time of the year, and he can't get any sleep.An 'American-izing' of the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name, 'Insomnia' is a stunning, extremely well shot (Wally Pfister was the D.P.) police procedural thriller that derives much fascination from the evolving relationship between the detective and the killer. Dormer is *not* squeaky clean, and Finch is not a hardcore criminal; his act of murder was an impulsive crime of passion. That said, Finch does maintain a calm air about himself as he taunts the protagonist.Pacino and the always excellent Williams work together extremely well; this was from the latter's intriguing stretch during 2002 where he 'went dark' with his role choices, having also appeared in the black comedy 'Death to Smoochy' and another thriller, 'One Hour Photo'. They receive very strong support from Dooley, the engaging Hilary Swank (as an eager young cop who reveres Dormer and his career), Donovan, Maura Tierney, Jonathan Jackson, Katharine Isabelle, and Nicky Katt. (Look for Isabelles' 'Ginger Snaps' series co-star Emily Perkins in a brief bit.)Director Christopher Nolan, working from the screenplay by Hillary Seitz, makes this a compelling entertainment that succeeds because it's not quite the typical, conventional cop vs. psycho Hollywood thriller. The attraction of seeing a triple threat of Oscar winners in Pacino, Williams, and Swank is just icing on the cake. Overall, 'Insomnia' is a stirring, emotional journey, and comes highly recommended.Nine out of 10.",9,0,0,17 September 2019
Don Jon," Interesting examination of dating in the modern age.
","The talented actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes a creditable writing & directing debut with this stylish, amusing, and sexually frank character study. Gordon-Levitt himself plays the character in question, a young New Jersey man 'in the service industry' with a fairly short list of what matters to him in life. He has a real knack for being able to score with any hot woman he desires, but at the same time he has a hopeless addiction to Internet pornography. He can't go a day without checking out numerous sites. Then he meets a beauty, Barbara Sugarman (the delectable Scarlett Johansson), with whom he might be able to maintain an actual relationship. But he just can't give up his daily habit.This extremely well shot film attempts to take a hard look at how todays' people have hangups that prevent them from having fulfilling relationships. As we are shown, both Jon and Barbara have idealized notions: he finds Internet porn preferable to real life sex, and she's been raised on scores of romantic movies, so they've been conditioned to concentrate on fantasy rather than reality. Gordon-Levitt cannily makes references to the way that sex is sold in order to appeal to consumers, which is all part of the problem. What doesn't help is when people get too wrapped up in themselves, and cannot make connections to other flesh & blood human beings.There's of course lots of raunchy imagery, and quite a bit of colourful language, so this won't be for all tastes, but Gordon-Levitt is using it all in service of the plot.He's charming and engaging in the lead, and Johansson is similarly appealing. Julianne Moore has a delightful presence as the older woman Jon encounters in night school; it's with her that he's finally able to display some real candor. Tony Danza and Glenne Headly are fine as Jons' parents, and Rob Brown and Jeremy Luke have their moments as his friends.Thankfully, the script refrains from ever becoming TOO predictable.Eight out of 10.",8,2,4,25 November 2015
Zodiac," A *very* long but extremely engrossing film.
","The real-life Zodiac murders that plagued the Bay Area in the late 1960s make for great drama in this, one of David Finchers' finest achievements as a director. The 'Zodiac', as he dubs himself, delights in taunting the cops and mailing letters to them, while obviously enjoying being one step ahead of them most of the time.However, the film doesn't really focus on him. Some of the murders are re-enacted, but this story focuses on the people who hunted the killer down, in particular Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), who inspired the Steve McQueen performance in 'Bullitt', and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards). It's only in the last hour or so of 'Zodiac' that it fully becomes the story of Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who becomes obsessed with playing amateur detective, and keeping the case alive when everybody else has seemingly given up.Although this would seem to be unwieldy at two hours and 37 minutes (two hours and 43 minutes if you're watching the directors' cut), it remains utterly absorbing throughout, making the most of the police-procedural aspect of the storytelling. The material IS rather fascinating, remaining one of the most fascinating unsolved cases of all time.Towards the end, the narrative does become awfully familiar, as Graysmith alienates his wife (Chloe Sevigny, who is unfortunately not given anything really interesting to do) and ropes his kids into helping him work the clues. It's no surprise when she takes the kids and hauls ass out of there.Yet, as portrayed by Gyllenhaal, a very fine actor indeed, the mans' earnestness does make him a reasonably likeable character. And 'Zodiac' also offers impressive showcases for a rich variety of supporting actors: Robert Downey, Jr., Brian Cox, Elias Koteas, John Carroll Lynch (who plays the late Arthur Leigh Allen, the person who remained the prime suspect for a long time), John Getz, John Terry, Candy Clark, Dermot Mulroney, Donal Logue, Philip Baker Hall, Zach Grenier, John Mahon, Adam Goldberg, James Le Gros, Charles Fleischer, and Clea DuVall. The scene in Fleischers' basement late in the film is brilliantly creepy.Fincher and company took themselves very seriously in making this film, and it shows. They were supposedly real sticklers for detail, using Graysmiths' books and actual case files as their source material. They also refrain from making this all about Zodiac, not bothering to re-enact those murders which had no witnesses or survivors. The documentary-style approach ultimately works wonders; there's very little room for melodrama, or overstatement. Set largely in the 1970s, emulation of that era is well done, including a score by veteran composer David Shire and a vintage opening Paramount logo sequence.While this viewer would hesitate to come right out and call this 'perfect', he will say that it does come pretty close, entertaining and informing its audience and never making the film seem as long as it is.Nine out of 10.",9,1,1,18 May 2018
The Terminator," A career highlight for Cameron and Schwarzenegger.
","Filmmaker James Cameron had already showed a real style and vision when working for Roger Corman's special effects and art department, also learning well how to shoot fast and on a low budget. Here his talent and experience paid off with this breakthrough film, truly a model action picture with its unflagging pace and intensity level. It moves forward quite well while also remaining coherent, telling an interesting story that owes a debt to not only the works of Harlan Ellison, as is credited at the end, but Michael Crichtons' 'Westworld'. Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a credible star performance as the title character, a cyborg sent to 1984 from the future by an omnipotent artificial intelligence. It wants to ensure that its primary human enemy, a man named John Connor, is never born, so the terminator is sent back in time to assassinate his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton). Fortunately, a protector for Sarah is also sent back, a sensitive soldier named Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn). Reese will have his work cut out for him not only trying to keep Sarah alive, but convincing her that his wild sounding story is indeed reality. 'The Terminator' has incredible atmosphere, in both its present and future scenes, and has some wonderful eye popping visuals, not to mention fantastic special effects work by Stan Winston. Brad Fiedel's music score is catchy and iconic, but sounds even more haunting and effective when it's done as a simple piano melody. The editing (by Mark Goldblatt), art direction (by George Costello), and cinematography (by Adam Greenberg) are all first rate. The movie does date itself in certain ways (fashion styles and music), but that merely adds to the appeal in this viewers' humble opinion. It's also not wall to wall action, as it takes some breathers here and there, and is really quite touching in some of its quieter moments. The casting is spot on all the way down the line. Schwarzenegger is perfect as the relentless killing machine, especially as the role doesn't require a lot of dialogue, the under-rated Biehn does a nice job of selling his character and the material, and appealing Hamilton does a fine job with her character arc as Sarah changes from being kind of a mousy person to being more take-charge. The excellent supporting cast features such reliable people as Lance Henriksen (who's a hoot), Paul Winfield, Rick Rossovich, and Earl Boen, and there are some wonderful bits for Bill Paxton, Brian Thompson, and Dick Miller. Cameron and co-writer / producer Gale Anne Hurd inject the film with a decent dose of humour (such as the terminator cycling through various possible responses to a question) that never becomes too prevalent. 'The Terminator' is simply one of the best films of its kind, and its impact on pop culture (including Arnolds' best known cinematic one-liner of them all) is undeniable. A must see for sci-fi and action lovers. Followed by three sequels and the 'Sarah Connor Chronicles' TV series. 10 out of 10.",10,2,3,3 November 2012
Cloverfield," A good thrill ride.
","Basically a melding of 'Godzilla' and 'The Blair Witch Project', this high-concept movie is a better than usual example of what has come to be known as the 'found footage' genre. Whatever it may lack in character development or storytelling skill is made up for by a nonstop sense of excitement. It just thrusts characters and the audience alike into a horrifying situation that nobody can explain and seemingly with little to no chance for escape. It starts out mildly and then around the 18 minute mark it abruptly shifts gears. It's genuinely spooky at times and features a monster that is frightening in its capacity for violence, not to mention its immense *size*. Director Matt Reeves and company, working from Drew Goddards' script, follow conventional wisdom in showing this thing just a bit at a time, gearing up for the big reveal.The story starts out as a group of friends in Manhattan have a farewell party for one of their number, Rob (Michael Stahl-David), who's moving on to a job in Japan. But things go seriously awry when this monster shows up and creates chaos and panic. While the military works feverishly to try to take the monster down and evacuate the citizens, Rob and his friends embark on a mission to locate and rescue Beth (Odette Annable); all the while, the character of 'Hud' (T.J. Miller), who was given a video camera to record testimonials at this party, insists on documenting the unfolding events.One good thing is that, at least from this viewers' perspective, the six main characters are basically likable even as they attempt something that looks foolish and suicidal. Once the action starts, it achieves a respectable intensity level, although there are quieter moments when our protagonists desperately try to take a breather. The special effects are generally decent (the image of the Statue of Liberty's head in a street is a memorable one), and the monster itself is amusingly designed and completely bad ass.If one can stomach the overactive camera work (a bone of contention for many who've seen it), 'Cloverfield' does manage to be a solidly enjoyable thriller.Seven out of 10.",7,0,1,10 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The initial trilogy ends in high style.
","George Lucas and company bring closure to the lives of the original beloved characters in this admittedly long and episodic but compelling 6th chapter. It's an emotional journey, to be sure, more emotional than the first two films, but it offers enough excitement and humour to make it great diversionary entertainment. The actors settle into their old roles comfortably and are very well supported by a rich variety of human and alien characters. With the directing reins now turned over to Richard Marquand (hired for this gig based on his direction of the thriller 'Eye of the Needle'), the story is broken into a few major set pieces.Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian and others reunite to rescue their good friend Han Solo from the decadent palace of loathsome alien slug Jabba the Hutt, the powerful crime kingpin for whom Han had once smuggled goods. The action moves to Dagobah, where Luke confronts Yoda over the matter of his parentage, and on to the woodsy moon of Endor where the Rebels are plotting to destroy the shield that the Empire is using to protect its latest Death Star battle station. And Luke finally has the confrontation with his father Darth Vader and the deadly, seductive Emperor (a deliciously evil Ian McDiarmid) that Ben and Yoda had insisted would be inevitable.While lacking the innovative nature of the first film, and dark, more mature quality of the second, this entry does bring a satisfying conclusion to the saga, in the spirit of those old adventure serials of decades past. John Williams' music is as rousing as it's ever been, and the filmmakers once again plunge us into an assortment of different environments (desert, swamp, forest, etc.) The chase and battle sequences are truly breathtaking and impressive. The early scenes in Jabbas' palace allow the creature and makeup departments to come up with moments that can rival the memorable cantina segment from 'Star Wars'. That brings this review to the matter of the Ewoks, those fuzzy teddy bears whom a fair amount of the audience profess to hate. All this viewer can say is that he's never had a problem with them.Particularly enjoyable is the resolution to Luke's relationship with Vader, as the black clad villain rediscovers his humanity when forced to make a choice. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't bring up certain scenes with Leia, which have intrigued scores of boys and men over the years.'Return of the Jedi' may not be as good as its predecessors overall, but it's still quite a bit of fun.Eight out of 10.",8,0,2,12 August 2013
MASH," 'Now fair's fair, Henry. If I nail Hot Lips and hit Hawkeye, can I go home, too?'
","'MASH' tells the tale of a military medical unit operating during the Korean War. In order to deal with the reality and horrors of war, the characters - especially the top surgeons - adopt eccentric, free-spirited personalities. They make nemeses out of the sexy but officious Major Houlihan (Sally Kellerman) and the Bible-thumping Major Burns (Robert Duvall). The principal bunch of wacky fun lovers are 'Hawkeye' Pierce (Donald Sutherland), Duke Forrest (Tom Skerritt), and martini-loving Trapper John McIntyre (Elliott Gould).Followed by the long-running TV series two years later, this dark comedy proved to be the first big hit for its celebrated director, Robert Altman. It raised irreverence to an art form, with some very funny lines along the way, and engaging performances from virtually everybody concerned. One might argue that the film has no real through-line in terms of story, and in truth, the script (by Ring Lardner, Jr., based on a novel by Richard Hooker) does have an episodic nature. But it's quite simply a fun film, one made in the days far before political correctness became more of a norm. It's also the first mainstream Hollywood film in which somebody utters an F-bomb (during the climactic football game, which is a real corker). It nicely captures a sense of chaos, with characters often talking right over each other, and rendering some of the dialogue unintelligible. One highlight is a bit of revenge that much of the cast pulls on Hot Lips; it would play perfectly in any of the raunch comedies of the 1980s. Some viewers may feel a little queasy with the use of blood in various operation scenes.As was already said, the cast is first-rate. Sutherland, Skerritt, and Gould make a good team, and receive exemplary support from Kellerman, Duvall, Roger Bowen as the rather permissive lieutenant colonel, Rene Auberjonois as the well-meaning reverend, David Arkin as Vollmer, and Michael Murphy as 'Me Lai' Marston. Many of the remaining cast members were at the time unknowns (at least, to the acting profession), so they get official 'introducing' credits: Fred 'The Hammer' Williamson, Bud Cort, G. Wood, Gary Burghoff (the only actor here to reprise his role for the series), Jo Ann Pflug, Danny Goldman, etc.Bright, largely upbeat entertainment, that remains utterly engrossing for the better part of two hours, with a memorable song, 'Suicide is Painless', for which the music would be later appropriated for the series.Eight out of 10.",8,0,0,10 May 2020
Alien," One of the quintessential sci-fi horror films.
","Taking inspiration from such B pictures as 'It! The Terror From Beyond Space' and Mario Bavas' 'Planet of the Vampires', the extremely iconic 'Alien' still stands tall, 38 years after its release, as a prime example of how to do everything right in this kind of film. It's got powerfully effective atmosphere, dazzling landscapes, innovative visuals, memorable special effects, and a slowly, steadily building sense of dread.Nowadays, in genre fare the convention is to knock people out of their socks with spectacle and constant action (not to mention quick cutting); here, the filmmakers, led by the visionary director Ridley Scott (in only his second feature film) dare to take their time and parcel out the horror carefully. In fact, the big 'money shot' of this film doesn't even occur until almost the halfway point. And what a potent scene it is, in its time having the ability to shock viewers out of their complacency.The story tells of the crew of an interstellar towing vehicle who intercept an extraterrestrial S.O.S. and are obliged to check it out. What they find are a derelict spacecraft, an unpleasant truth about that message, and an insidious alien menace that proceeds to make mincemeat out of the terrified individuals involved.'Alien' was a revelation in the way that it introduced a new breed of space traveller to the science-fiction genre, one that didn't dress in uniform but who represented the average working Joe or Jane. It also created one of the most striking creatures to be found in cinema, one that grew in stages, and did unpleasant things to the human body. The design is by the great Swiss artist H.R. Giger, the execution by Carlo Rambaldi, and its hideous sexual overtones are not lost on viewers. Jerry Goldsmiths' music is beautifully eerie and nicely understated at times. Even the opening credits have a fantastic, spooky simplicity to them.The limited number of human characters insures a high degree of intimacy, and the actors, a superb mix of American and British talent - Tom Skerritt as the ineffective Captain Dallas, John Hurt as the fatally inquisitive Kane, Sigourney Weaver (in the breakout performance that made her a star) as the take-charge Ripley, Harry Dean Stanton as the laid-back Brett, Yaphet Kotto as the argumentative Parker, Ian Holm as the subtly dubious Ash, and Veronica Cartwright as nervous wreck Lambert - completely draw us in to the reality of their situation.As things progress, one will notice that the pace picks up considerably in the second half, as things quickly go from bad to worse to unthinkable. Plus, the script (screenplay by Dan O'Bannon, based on a story by him and Ronald Shusett) definitely has something to say about the nefarious nature of corporate interests.All these years later, the film is still quite capable of chilling audiences, and set forth a beloved franchise including three sequels, two crossover projects with the 'Predator' series, a prequel ('Prometheus'), and the upcoming 'Alien: Covenant'. Must viewing for genre fans.10 out of 10.",10,0,1,12 November 2012
Nacho Libre," Sometimes you wear stretchy pants in your room. It's for fun.
","If nothing else, 'Nacho Libre' is a reasonably amusing and endearing vehicle for the talented star, Jack Black. He's actually a bit more restrained than is typical for him, taking the time to create an engaging character with some real heart. Nacho Libre is a friar at a Mexican monastery who works as the cook. Determined to do right by the orphans living there, and just as determined to win the love of beautiful nun Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera), he realizes his lifes' dream of being a Luchador, or Mexican wrestler.Concocted by the creators of 'Napoleon Dynamite', this amiable feature may not deliver true belly laughs, and it can get childishly crude, but it's hard to dislike or dismiss. It does benefit from genuinely likeable individuals at the core of the story. Sure, Blacks' 'accent' doesn't exactly cut it, but director Jared Hess (who co-wrote the script with Mike White and his wife Jerusha) never aims to take ANY of this very seriously. The result may be a fairly inconsequential movie, but it entertains adequately for a well-paced 93 minutes. The ring action is fun, and Black does have some chemistry with Hector Jimenez, who plays the street kid who becomes his steadfast companion. Their escapades are good for some laughs, such as when Jimenez is pursued by a corpulent admirer, or when Black pretends to be part of an ensemble of musicians.'Nacho Libre' makes no attempt to be 'realistic'. It merely shows comedy lovers a good time for an hour and a half, with a blessed lack of pretentiousness.Six out of 10.",6,0,0,31 May 2020
Taxi Driver," An incredible snapshot of 1970s NYC.
","Writer Paul Schrader and director Martin Scorsese have a very memorable vision in this highly regarded piece of work, certainly very memorable in the careers of all involved and one which of course is now extremely iconic and often quoted. More than anything else, it's the tale of a man who feels disconnected from society at large, a society which he has come to regard as filthy and corrupt and in need of a cleanup. That doesn't change the fact, however, that the man in question is mentally unbalanced and would likely never completely fit in. Therefore, an all night cab driver would seem to be the perfect occupation for him, and while on the job he meets the various flotsam and jetsam that make up the NYC population. Some viewers don't like the dark, grim, and ultimately very violent journey that this film takes us on, but to some it feels all too real.Robert De Niro towers over all with his performance as alienated cabbie Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who does his best to live a normal life. The trouble is, he doesn't really know how to go about it. When he starts courting Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a beautiful worker on the presidential campaign of politician Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris), his idea of a good date is taking her to see a dirty movie. During the course of this story, he chats up Palantine, arms himself to the teeth, and makes the acquaintance of people such as Wizard (Peter Boyle), a philosophical co-worker, Iris (Jodie Foster), an underage prostitute, and 'Sport' (Harvey Keitel), Iris's degenerate pimp. It's only a matter of time until our lonely protagonist makes the descent into violence.All of the parts are well cast in this thing. Even when roles aren't really integral to the story (such as Tom, played by Albert Brooks), you do appreciate their presence. Foster is absolutely incredible as the girl in need of rescuing, and Keitel is truly, excellently creepy as her employer. Familiar character players in this cast include Victor Argo, Harry Northup, and Joe Spinell. Scorseses' cameo as the sicko watching his wife's silhouette is one you don't forget.Heavy assets are the vivid atmosphere and depiction of different areas of the city, especially the seamier ones, and the haunting music score by Bernard Herrmann, which turned out to be the last one by the composer. That's a very chilling opening when a cab emerges from the smoke while the main theme plays.It's not hard to see why 'Taxi Driver' would be so influential; even its detractors don't deny the massive impact that it's had on popular culture.Nine out of 10.",9,1,2,25 March 2014
Over the Top," Could you ever doubt Sly?
","Sly Stallone is once again in his element, in this memorable example of formula filmmaking from Cannon Group head honcho Menahem Golan. The star plays Lincoln Hawk, an independent trucker who'd left his wife (Susan Blakely) and son (David Mendenhall) years ago. Now, 10 years later, she is on her death bed, and urges him to make up for lost time. So Lincoln and young Michael do their best at bonding, while Lincoln prepares for an event that could make him or break him: winning the World Arm Wrestling Championship. Lincoln must also compete with Michaels' arrogant, filthy rich grandfather (a scenery chewing Robert Loggia) for the boys' affections.Ultimately, the movie is better than its reputation. It worked for this viewer because it wasn't *just* about arm wrestling. For its first two thirds, anyway, it's a fairly compelling and touching story of a dad who knows he screwed up and is now determined to atone for his mistake. The father-son relationship will obviously get off to a 'rocky' start, but will improve as the story progresses. (The movies' script is credited to Stirling Silliphant and Sly himself, based on a story by David Engelbach and veteran actor Gary Conway.)The final third that focuses on the competition is pretty standard stuff: slick, manipulative, and trying to keep us in suspense even though we *know* how it's all going to turn out. It does benefit from the colourful personalities of the ultra-macho competitors, with Rick Zumwalt (actually, the third choice for his role) as domineering, reigning champion Bull Hurley. The soundtrack is full of grandiose pop tunes from the likes of Eddie Money and the ubiquitous Kenny Loggins.The acting is serviceable from most of the cast. Sly's appeal as an underdog hero remains intact, and Loggia isn't treated as a purely one-dimensional villain. You do believe that he genuinely loves his grandson, yet he's still the type to believe that money and influence matter. Blakely has a thankless role, being required to literally phone in her performance. Mendenhall is okay as the kid. Assorted familiar faces among the supporting cast are Terry Funk, Magic Schwarz, Randy Raney ('Rambo III'), Sam Scarber ('Shocker'), and Flo Lawrence ('Don't Answer the Phone!').All in all, this is a predictable and yet amusing bit of entertainment that does have its moments, such as Sly driving his big rig right into Loggias' house.Six out of 10.",6,1,1,14 April 2020
Pacific Rim," Not del Toros' finest hour. Still, a fairly amusing time at the movies.
","Humans must do battle with massive monsters known as Kaiju when a 'breach' between dimensions opens deep within the ocean. To do this, the people of the world unite to create equally colossal fighting machines dubbed Jaegers (the German word for 'hunter'). In order to successfully operate a Jaeger, a bond, or 'Drift', must exist between two pilots, a bond that is mental and spiritual as well as physical. The fate of humanity rests on the shoulders of Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), who will go into battle with an eager to please rookie (Rinko Kikuchi) at his side.Here, acclaimed filmmaker Guillermo del Toro attempts to play in the same sort of sandbox popularized by movies like 'Independence Day'. Overall, it's more of a visual effects showcase than it is anything else, with a thin story and an over emphasis on spectacle. It comes off like a video game adaptation much of the time, with not too many human moments along the way. Granted, the movie is pleasing to look at sometimes, with a virtual candy store of futuristic images. The Jaegers are also imaginatively designed (at least, their interiors are), although the Kaiju are not particularly impressive.As could be expected, this is not the thing you want to watch if you're looking for truly great acting. Too many of the characters and performances are annoying, although Idris Elba, as Beckets' sombre commanding officer, has a typically solid presence. Hunnam is an underwhelming hero, with no real charisma at his disposal. Ron Perlman, whose working relationship with del Toro dates back to 1992 and the film 'Cronos', hams his way through a brief role as a sleazebag who deals in Kaiju body parts on the black market. The true saving grace is the cute and appealing Kikuchi.Del Toro does his able best to keep his audience from being bored, but without the desire to consistently root for the heroes, it's hard to care a great deal for many of the characters here.Still, if you just want a gung ho popcorn flick, and aren't looking for substance, 'Pacific Rim' is passable entertainment.Seven out of 10.",7,1,1,24 August 2017
Gone Baby Gone," An impressive directing debut for Affleck.
","After taking something of a break from the Hollywood scene, actor Ben Affleck managed to successfully reinvent himself as a filmmaker, and 'Gone Baby Gone' proved to be just the start of good things, with 'The Town' and 'Argo' having also gotten their fair share of critical acclaim. He certainly knows his milieu here, having hailed from Boston himself, and does an excellent job at collecting a variety of totally authentic local characters. He also adapts (with Aaron Stockard) the novel by Dennis Lehane, which tells the tale of a childs' abduction. Bens' younger brother Casey stars as Patrick Kenzie, a private investigator who specializes in missing persons cases, along with romantic & professional partner Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan). The two of them are hired by the girls' aunt and uncle to supplement the work that the police are already doing. They find themselves getting personally involved as they pursue the leads, both in and out of the company of detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton). Even when it seems as if the case has come to a conclusion, Patrick realizes that too many people have not been playing straight with him, leading to a rich amount of twists and turns. Excellent location shooting, gorgeous cinematography (by John Toll), and an emotionally heavy story are all assets as Affleck takes us on this odyssey. Giving this story resonance is the way it poses a big ethical dilemma: what, really, is the best thing to do for others? Should underhanded methods be permissible if a motive is pure? Viewers will appreciate being intellectually stimulated while they are entertained by the multi layered, complex script. The acting is superb from all of the players: Amy Madigan is sincere and sympathetic as the little girls' aunt, Titus Welliver solid as her uncle, Harris compelling as the lead detective on the case, and Morgan Freeman a tower of strength as usual as the police chief. Casey A. proves himself capable of carrying a picture, but the performer who stands out the most is Amy Ryan as Helene, the girls' trashy mother; she's no less than completely convincing. All in all, 'Gone Baby Gone' is an effective achievement: deliberately paced, atmospheric, and satisfying, with a wrap-up that doesn't necessarily provide all the answers but raises interesting questions. It comes highly recommended. Eight out of 10.",8,0,1,19 February 2013
Predator," 'If it bleeds, we can kill it.'
","'Predator' is one of the best ever vehicles for action superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger, and stands tall as an example of just how capable director John McTiernan was during this time, as he moved from this to 'Die Hard' to 'The Hunt for Red October'. It's a slam bang kick ass combination of sci-fi, action, and suspense, with a touch of horror, with its roots in a similar, much lower budgeted film of seven years previous, 'Without Warning'.Arnold plays Dutch, leader of an elite rescue team hired for a mission in the South American Jungle. Arnold and his men haven't been told the truth about why they were hired, but that's the least of their problems. Soon a stealthy, merciless, and invisible entity will be stalking them and eventually killing them one at a time, basically hunting them for the sport of the thing.Everything comes together very well in this well paced, brutal, and tension filled spectacle with tons of gunfire and explosions, plus some very impressive special effects, especially the 'cloaking' effect. The Predator itself is the work of the late, great Stan Winston and a team including people like Screaming Mad George, Howard Berger, and Robert Kurtzman. On location shooting in Mexico is to the movies' credit; there's much genuine jungle atmosphere. Alan Silvestris' propulsive music is superb; when it quiets down and it's just the percussion it creates an eerie effect.The pacing is excellent throughout. It's very deliberate at first, but picks up considerably once Dutchs' team starts being eliminated. THEN things start happening very fast. The final half hour or so when it's just Dutch vs. the monster is the best part, and there's an interesting idea at work when Dutch is obliged to get 'primitive' in a hurry in order to try to defeat his enemy.Also, while Arnold is showcased to good effect, the movie doesn't just revolve around him. There's a fine ensemble here, beginning with charismatic Carl Weathers as Dutchs' old buddy Dillon. Bill Duke stands out as Mac; also appearing are Jesse Ventura as Blain, Sonny Landham as Billy, Richard Chaves as Poncho, 'Lethal Weapon' screenwriter Shane Black playing comedy relief guy Hawkins, old pro R.G. Armstrong as General Phillips, and lovely Elpidia Carrillo in the lone female role as Anna. Another late talent, the wonderful Kevin Peter Hall, has lots of presence as the Predator (and has a secondary role near the end as a chopper pilot), a role that was originally going to be played by Jean-Claude Van Damme! (Another trivia note: Hall had also played the murderous alien in 'Without Warning'.)A rousing story from start to finish, 'Predator' delivers a lot of fun, and has quite a quotable script (by Jim Thomas & John Thomas) to boot. It even starts its end credits with a curtain call, the kind of thing we don't see all that often. Highly recommended to any action fan.Nine out of 10.",9,1,2,22 December 2012
Nightcrawler," 'Think of our newscast as a screaming woman running down the street with her throat cut.'
","Jake Gyllenhaal is aces in this provocative thriller that has some pretty potent things to say about the cutthroat, sensationalistic nature of the entire news business. Jake plays Lou Bloom, an intense and ambitious young man. He's also entirely self serving and seemingly without scruples of any kind. Therefore, he's a natural for the business of 'nightcrawling': functioning as an independent operator who will show up at crime scenes, accident scenes, etc. and film the most lurid stuff possible to sell to local TV networks. Lou continues to up his game as the sordid story plays out, and finds something of a kindred spirit in Nina Romina (Rene Russo), a weary and hardened veteran of the news business.It's all too easy to be cynical in this day and age. The idea of characters such as Lou, who value self gain more than human life, and profit from the suffering of others, is absolutely believable to this viewer. While it may be tough for some people to stick with, given the nature of this guy that Jake is playing, he manages to be interesting and compelling BECAUSE of his deeply flawed personality. You may despise the guy, more and more as the story goes on, but you're always curious as to what depths he will sink. After all, this is a man who thinks nothing of rearranging a corpse at an accident scene for the sake of a better picture. Functioning as a counterpoint and something of a moral centre is Lou's assistant, Rick (the appealing Riz Ahmed), who is often taken aback by his unethical boss. And representing the seen-it-all extreme cynicism that experience provides are people like Nina, who realizes just how desperately her station will need to rely on Lou, and veteran nightcrawler Joe Loder (Bill Paxton, doing a solid job in a fairly small role).Jake is wonderful in what is one of the best performances that this viewer has seen in movies of the last few years. He truly is a talent to watch. And it's nice to see writer / director Dan Gilroy and the production give Russo what amounts to one of her best parts in ages.Slickly shot, entirely on location in Los Angeles. 'Nightcrawler' is fairly long, at just under two hours, but it's so riveting at times that the time moves along quicker than one would think.Gyllenhaal was also one of the producers.Eight out of 10.",8,0,0,28 April 2016
Burn After Reading," 'You are part of a league of morons.'
","The Coen brothers Joel and Ethan put their distinctive comic spin on the spy genre with 'Burn After Reading'. Although it's not quite as good as 'Fargo' or 'Raising Arizona' in this viewers' humble opinion, it's still funny enough and smart enough to qualify as a good time. It works because its characters are clueless and naive and totally out of their depth, and it's fun watching a bunch of talented stars play these grasping bozos.Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt play Linda and Chad, two schmucks who work at a gym called Hardbodies. One day, the janitor finds a disc in a locker room that turns out to have VERY mildly interesting stuff on it. As it turns out, this disc contains the memoirs of a disgruntled CIA agent named Osborne Cox (John Malkovich). Linda and Chad figure to capitalize on this find somehow, but their plans go awry. Meanwhile, womanizing Treasury agent Harry (George Clooney) manages to fool around with both Linda and Osbornes' fed-up wife Katie (Tilda Swinton).It's a testament to the abilities of this cast that 'Burn After Reading' is as entertaining as it is, but the script by the Coens was already pretty amusing. One has to wonder how fools like Linda (who's desperate to 'improve' her appearance with a series of plastic surgeries) and Chad can possibly extricate themselves from this mess into which they've placed themselves. And Harry has his own problems. Not only has he obsessed over creating his own hilarious gadget, but he ends up faced with a problem that completely unnerves him since he presumably had quite the 'safe' career. (He claims he's never had cause to draw his weapon.)Clooney and especially Pitt are hilarious. Malkovich does a lot of yelling in an amusingly unsympathetic role. McDormand is a delight. And Richard Jenkins, Elizabeth Marvel (as Harry's wife, a successful author), David Rasche, J.K. Simmons, Olek Krupa, J.R. Horne, and Jeffrey DeMunn add to the hilarity with their expert performances.Everything leads to a priceless series of revelations / resolutions dictated to us by Rasche, and Simmons' reactions in this finale are simply great.Overall, this is a good comedy that is well worth a look.Seven out of 10.",7,0,0,31 May 2019
The Bourne Identity," A rousing mix of action and intrigue.
","Previously filmed as a TV miniseries in the 1980s, Robert Ludlums' spy thriller 'The Bourne Identity' gets re-imagined for the movie audiences of the 21st century, and it's a refreshingly more human look at a well worn genre, giving us a hero who's believable at all times; he may become a standard action hero in some scenes, yet has the appeal of an average Joe; Matt Damon delivers a creditable performance in this role. At the start of this story, he's fished out of the Mediterranean Sea with two bullet holes in his back and no memory of who he is. Soon he's forced to take it on the lam, as his CIA superiors back home are determined to put closure on his botched mission. Fortunately he manages to hook up with a young woman, Marie (Franka Potente of 'Run Lola Run') who is able to provide him with some all important transportation. The action scenes are stylishly staged, but never overwhelm the meaty story which gets a respectful adaptation thanks to screenwriters Tony Gilroy & W. Blake Herron, director Doug Liman, and a talented cast and crew. They just hook you right in with an impressive atmospheric opening and slowly but surely begin to crank up the tension. Fine use is made of various international locations and the widescreen cinematography (by Oliver Wood) is excellent. Damon is fun to watch in the lead; even though his character may be in the dark for the balance of the movie, he always shows himself able to adapt to different situations and to sense when danger is near. He shares a good chemistry with German star Potente, who's very appealing and as sexy as any 'Bond girl' in the James Bond franchise. Also in the excellent cast are Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Walton Goggins, and Julia Stiles, although Clive Owen is kind of wasted as a professional assassin dubbed The Professor; his is an intriguing character who disappears from the story a little too soon. Many riveting scenes, including one where Bourne is kind of making like Spider-Man during an escape attempt and a lively car chase sequence. Even at 119 minutes, this never feels as long as it is as Damon, Liman, and company keep you watching and engrossed the entire time. All in all, this can stand up very well against any James Bond series entry or other spy film of old; it's got enough vitality and solid story telling to make it pleasant viewing. Executive produced by Ludlum, and followed by 'The Bourne Supremacy' and 'The Bourne Ultimatum'. Eight out of 10.",8,3,3,3 January 2013
28 Weeks Later," A decent sequel.
","Continuing the events first portrayed in '28 Days Later', this sequel details what happens when the infected have been dealt with, and London is starting to return to normal. The US Army comes in to supervise the operation, but is unprepared for a development that starts the whole bloody mess right up again. One of the refugees, Don (Robert Carlyle), wasn't honest with his children Tammy and Andy (Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton) about what happened to their mother, and that is going to come back to haunt him.Juan Carlos Fresnadillo takes over the directing chores from Danny Boyle, doing a serviceable job of administering action, atmosphere, and suspense. The screenplay isn't always very believable, but the actors are superb and the pacing speedier than that of the preceding film. Still, Fresnadillo won't avoid some of the more annoying clich√©s of the modern horror film, such as the frenetic and choppy editing. There may also be way too much digital gore for some horror fans.The top notch international cast is fun to watch: Rose Byrne as concerned medic Scarlet, Jeremy Renner as sympathetic sniper Doyle, Harold Perrineau as the helicopter pilot Flynn, Catherine McCormack as Dons' wife Alice, and Idris Elba as efficient Army officer Stone. In the films' second half, when Scarlet and Doyle become determined to see Tammy and Andy to safety, Byrne and Renner do particularly good work.One of the most impressive elements about this film is the stunning aerial photography, giving us a Gods'-eye view of a devastated London. Special effects are generally good, especially in the horrific scenes of the city being firebombed.'28 Weeks Later' looks to be a divisive film, with people usually either liking it or loathing it. At least it does manage to maintain an appropriate level of intensity.Seven out of 10.",7,2,4,5 October 2013
The Thing," 'Why don't we wait here for a little while...see what happens.'
","John Carpenter's intense, grim, shocking, and garish monster movie has transcended its poor box office performance back in 1982 to take its place as one of the great experiences of its kind, and one of the director's finest achievements. A more faithful adaptation of the John W. Campbell, Jr. short story 'Who Goes There?' than the 1951 Howard Hawks production 'The Thing from Another World', it gets a lot of impact from the central conceit of the story, dropped by the makers of the Hawks movie.Here, the rampaging alien has the ability to assume the appearance of any living thing that it consumes, leading to an overwhelming sense of paranoia as the men of the story have to come to terms with the reality that they can't trust each other any more.The Antarctic setting is perfect for such a story, with our characters completely cut off from contact with civilization, isolated and forced to work to save themselves. While the story is an extremely serious one, with a tone of dread established immediately, there are memorable doses of humour at select points that provide much needed and highly amusing relief. Ennio Morricone's subtle, scary music, unfairly nominated for a Razzie at the time, is appropriate to the story. Carpenter collaborates with a first rate creative team (especially production designer John Lloyd and cinematographer Dean Cundey) who lend their considerable talents to make an incredible looking movie. Carpenter uses his standard Panavision aspect ratio of 2.35:1 to arrange people and objects within the frame to great effect. Makeup effects expert Rob Bottin creates one of the most striking monsters to be seen in the science fiction genre, displaying a delightful macabre imagination all the way through; the scenes are now indelibly etched in the minds of those that have seen them. (Stan Winston's contribution, done as a favour in order to help Bottin with the workload, shouldn't be overlooked, either.)Carpenter's frequent leading man Kurt Russell delivers a superbly understated performance as the reluctant hero MacReady, and receives rock solid supporting performances by a well chosen cast of familiar character actors - Wilford Brimley, T.K. Carter, David Clennon, Keith David, Richard Dysart, Charles Hallahan, Peter Maloney, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, Joel Polis, and Thomas Waites.Carpenter's somewhat slow pace - at least in the early going - allows the creepiness and sense of mystery to really take hold until the nature of the threat is finally exposed. The story devastatingly illustrates just how ugly things can get when a chain of command is broken and a group of men start to mistrust and fear each other. (It's a brave move on the part of Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster to exclude female characters, something that wouldn't fly nowadays.)No matter how badly this may have fared both critically and commercially back in 1982, its following has done nothing but grown stronger in the over 30 years since its release. It represents a great effort from everybody involved.Nine out of 10.",9,2,5,6 November 2011
Pitch Black," Derivative, but fun.
","Co-writer / director David Twohy doesn't set out to reinvent the wheel here with this routinely plotted but visually striking and effective sci-fi / horror picture. He keeps it interesting with his main character, an enigmatic stranger named Riddick (the well cast, imposing Vin Diesel) with a dangerous past. In fact, the main characters are all interesting in their own way, the good and the evil alike. There's some very good atmosphere to be enjoyed here - this was partly filmed in the desolate Coober Pedy region of Australia - and Twohy creates solid suspense and some good thrills.A spacecraft transporting several civilians and the ex-con Riddick is seriously damaged while in flight and is forced to crash land on a nearby planet. Among the passengers and crew are pilot Carolyn Fry (lovely Radha Mitchell), a 'cop' named William Johns (Cole Hauser), a holy man, Imam (Keith David), and a kid, Jack (Rhiana Griffith). They're warned about Riddick by Johns, but he turns out not to be their big problem: the planet is warmed by three suns, there's about to be the first solar eclipse in 22 years, and monsters who thrive in the darkness will be free to stalk these unlucky survivors.In his first big starring role, Diesel showed that he had what it took to be a star. He has a commanding presence, as does the consistently reliable David. Mitchells' performance made a fan out of this viewer, as she spends the balance of the film trying to atone for an earlier decision she made. Lewis Fitz-Gerald supplies some comedy relief as Paris; sexy Claudia Black, John Moore, and Simon Burke round out the cast. The visual effects are generally pretty good, the creatures are imaginatively designed, and the film has a respectable pace going for it. These help to make 'Pitch Black' a good if not great example of its genre.Seven out of 10.",7,1,2,25 October 2013
The Hills Have Eyes," There's gore in them there hills!
","Remake specialist Alexandre Aja tackled Wes Cravens' 1977 shocker with this balls-to-the-wall, extremely intense sequel, and it's one of those cases where the new version is at least equal to its predecessor. (Some horror fans prefer the newer version.) Once it's got you, it just doesn't let you go, putting characters and viewers alike through an insane bloody ordeal. As a result, it's very entertaining in a very visceral way, but spectacle isn't all that it's got on its mind. It actually brings the political context even more to the forefront. It also devises a different sort of third act wherein the guy who becomes our principal protagonist meets the monsters on their turf, a devastated desert community.For those who aren't familiar with the story, it deals with a fairly typical urban family on a vacation who travel through some desolate countryside. They make a major mistake when they follow the advice of a decrepit gas station attendant (Tom Bower) and take a shortcut. They then make easy prey for another family, made up of mutated, cannibalistic, savage psychotics who naturally make their presence known once night falls.It may take a while for some people to start liking the victims, but they do become more engaging once they are able to tap into their inner badasses and go on the offensive. The biggest character arc belongs to Doug (Aaron Stanford), whom the viewer might not expect to be capable of handling the crises. Breathtaking scenery is one asset; this was actually filmed on location in Morocco. Creditable efforts by a top notch cast are another. Ted Levine is macho patriarch Big Bob, Kathleen Quinlan his more reserved, religious wife Ethel. Vinessa Shaw, Emilie de Ravin, and Dan Byrd play their kids, and reliable character actors Billy Drago and Robert Joy are among those playing the creeps. (Drago, playing the 2006 version of Papa Jupiter, ends up utterly wasted, however.) The makeup effects and splatter devised by Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger are excellent and Nicotero also has a cameo as one of the mutants.Right from the start, with his brutal bit before the opening credits, Aja is determined that his audience not be bored, and he succeeds admirably, keeping the film full of action until its big finish. It follows the story of Cravens' film closely enough for its first two thirds, then goes off on its own path. And it proves to be a hell of a ride.Craven and Peter Locke (producer of the Craven film) were among the producers on this version.Eight out of 10.",8,1,6,20 October 2013
The Orphanage," One of those horror films that genuinely moves you.
","As scripted by Sergio G. Sanchez and directed by J.A. Bayona, 'El Orfanato' a.k.a. 'The Orphanage' is a haunting, beautiful, and poetic horror tale. It derives its impact from being so utterly rich in emotion and for drenching it in genuine atmosphere rather going for the purely visceral impact - or relying too heavily on the jump scare. The performances, the writing, and the directing are very sensitive and you can completely get on the side of the lead character. And you're discovering things with her rather than being one step ahead the entire time. This is one film that could very well be described as a journey. And when it's all over, it will definitely stay with you.Gorgeous Belen Rueda stars as Laura, a young woman who lives with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) in what used to be the orphanage where she dwelled as a child. They seem to have a happy life with adopted son Simon (adorable Roger Princep), but haven't actually told the truth to the kid, either that he's sick (he's HIV positive) or that they're his adoptive parents and not his biological ones. She's concerned because of his association with imaginary friends, but things take an even darker one when the boy disappears from a costume party. It's up to Laura to find Simon and to probe the mysteries of this orphanage.Enhanced by a lovely score by Fernando Velazquez, 'El Orfanato' is deliberately paced but rewarding for patient viewers. It entirely hinges on the acting and the mood and in fact doesn't feature that much in the way of visual effects. There is a real sense of sadness throughout, and despair, and one can completely sympathize with Laura and Simon. The film is reasonably spooky, especially when paranormal experts and a medium (played by guest star Geraldine Chaplin) try to get in contact with the restless spirits of the piece; instead of making us see with our eyes what she is describing, it forces us to use our imagination. The final act is all about Laura as she isolates herself and attempts to recreate the past in order to unlock its secrets.Ultimately a satisfying experience, 'El Orfanato' would come highly recommended to those genre fans wishing for films more in the mold of 'The Haunting' (1963) and 'The Others'.Eight out of 10.",8,3,5,13 October 2013
Over the Hedge," Clever and satiric for adults. Just plain fun for kids.
","Based on the comic strip by Michael Fry and T. Lewis, this is a loud & lively animated comedy brimming with endearing characters, and some laugh out loud gags. Bruce Willis, back in the days when he still seemed to give a damn, is nicely cast as the voice of R.J., a conniving, self serving raccoon who foolishly tries to steal the food supply of a bear named Vincent (voice of Nick Nolte). When the stash is demolished, R.J. ropes a troupe of foraging forest critters into helping him find a replacement stash. And he believes there will be easy pickings when they go 'over the hedge' and into the suburban sprawl that is encroaching upon their wilderness.It is thanks to the success of 'Toy Story' from a decade previous that a formula got perfected in this sort of entertainment, with some bright and cutting humor for adults to enjoy. It's not subtle about its criticisms of suburban life, but some people might not mind. And, although it may be rather too intense for the youngest of your family members, kids are more than likely to really take to the critter characters. Some of the humor may be obvious, but it does still work. There is even a sort of nod to Pepe Le Pew cartoons as our heroes give Stella the skunk (voice of Wanda Sykes) a makeover in order to pull the wool over a pet cats' (voice of Omid Djalili) eyes.The animation is slick and first rate, and there's plenty of peppy music in the form of a score by Rupert Gregson-Williams and songs by Ben Folds.The all star main voice cast also includes William Shatner as a possum who's appropriately hammy when he fakes death, a hilarious Garry Shandling as Verne the turtle, Steve Carell as a crazed squirrel named Hammy, Thomas Haden Church as a lunkhead exterminator, Allison Janney as a neighborhood busybody, Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as porcupine parents, and pop star Avril Lavigne as the possum daughter.Quite entertaining overall, especially the way that it continues with gags through the closing credits.One of the brightest bits for this viewer was the way that R.J. educated his newfound friends on the way that humans worship food and give it such predominance in their lives.Eight out of 10.",8,0,0,18 June 2017
Wanted," 'Your name came up.'
","James McAvoy plays nerdy account manager Wesley Gibson, the kind of guy who lets people walk all over him - his girlfriend (Kristen Hager), his best friend / co-worker (Chris Pratt), who incidentally is getting it on with the girlfriend, and his boss (Lorna Scott). To his complete surprise, he learns that the dad who abandoned him as a baby was in fact a member of a team of assassins. Hooking up with a sleek lady, Fox (Angelina Jolie), and tutored by people such as Sloan (Morgan Freeman), he decides that he will leave his humdrum life behind and embrace the idea of avenging his fathers' death.It's not surprising to see that this was based on a comic book series. It does have a slick, over the top, sometimes cartoonish quality about it. It's often stylized to the point of insanity, with a nonstop barrage of CGI gags. If this is indeed meant to be viewed as a parody of 'Matrix' type action / sci-fi movies, it works pretty well, because it takes ridiculousness to a whole other level. The world that our characters occupy is a world where bullets can be made to NOT fly in a straight line, but CURVE AROUND objects. The visual gimmickry on display can be quite amusing. This does offer some fun, and gets better as it goes on and the story deepens. Whether the audience members predict the plot twists or not, these twists do help to give weight to the saga, and by then it's hard not to root for Wesley. His story does have the appeal of any such tale that involves a 'worm turning'.Freeman is good as always, and Jolie is cast in a perfect part for her. The solid supporting cast also includes Terence Stamp, Thomas Kretschmann, Common, Marc Warren, and David O'Hara. But most of the heavy lifting is done by top billed McAvoy. On occasion, his character can be annoying, but he grows more endearing as he 'grows a pair', so to speak.Overall, one thing can certainly be said about 'Wanted': it may be silly, but it's not boring.Six out of 10.",6,0,1,20 September 2017
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Worth seeing for Reilly's fine performance in the lead.
","From Judd Apatow and company comes this certainly very likable movie that parodies standard Hollywood biographies of musical entertainers, taking particular aim at 'Walk the Line' and 'Ray' but also working as a skewering of changing musical trends over the decades, as its lead character Dewey Cox (an endearing John C. Reilly) is more than willing to move from one genre to another, and basically do whatever it takes to keep up the rock 'n' roll lifestyle.Dewey Cox has had to deal with a tragic childhood incident which earned him the enmity of his father (Raymond J. Barry). The movie charts Dewey's progress over the years, as he ascends to stardom, becomes addicted to all manner of drugs, antagonizes the people in his life, and ultimately realizes what's truly important and puts his life back together.The Apatow style of comedy is evident as always, alternating between sweet and poignant moments and very adult moments - there's even some nudity. Sometimes it gets a little silly - such as the animated LSD trip sequence - but mostly it's an enjoyable movie that goes far on the abilities of its cast. Reilly, who does his own singing, is well supported by Kristen Wiig as his first wife, Jenna Fischer as the backup singer who becomes his second wife (while he's still married to the first one), Matt Besser and former 'SNL' cast members Tim Meadows & Chris Parnell as his bandmates, and Barry & Margo Martindale as his parents. There are a lot of fun bits along the way, from the likes of Rance Howard, Craig Robinson, Harold Ramis, Jack McBrayer, Ed Helms, Gerry Bednob, David Krumholtz, Jane Lynch, and Simon Helberg. Particularly funny is the stunt casting of people like Frankie Muniz, as Buddy Holly, and Justin Long, Paul Rudd, Jason Schwartzman, and Jack Black as the Beatles! Nice cameos by real life music stars are a treat, as well.There are enough laugh out loud moments to make all of this pleasant enough (at least this never gets truly mean spirited), and as a bonus the music is often genuinely catchy as well as amusing. Overall, good if not great stuff.Seven out of 10.",7,0,0,8 April 2012
Duck Soup," You know what would go great with this film?
","A big glass eliminate.'Duck Soup' is often hysterical madcap comedy, showcasing the legendary Marx Brothers unit to great effect. The songs are catchy, the energy incredible, and the delivery breathless. Many of the comedies of today have got nothing on this level of invention, satirical detail, and genuine belly laughs. The irrepressible Groucho is Rufus T. Firefly, elevated to the position of president / dictator of tiny, financially strapped country Freedonia. Rufus's cheeky and sardonic ways only serve to create problems, not the least of which is rubbing the leader of the neighbouring country Sylvania the wrong way. The one liners come fast and furious, and the cast plays the entire thing to perfection. Among the many set pieces are the repeated scuffles Harpo and Chico, as spies Pinky and Chicolini, get into with a street vendor, the sight of three Grouchos running about (as Pinky and Chicolini masquerade as Rufus in order to get their hands on valuable battle plans), and of course the one sequence everybody remembers, the mirror sequence, which is old style vaudeville at its best. Margaret Dumont is a delight in her perpetual 'straight woman' role, often uttering her lines in a priceless sing song style. It's too bad that this would be the last time that Zeppo would act with his brothers, as he's given a fair amount to do here, and one of the biggest joys is seeing the brothers performing together near the end. Harpo gets some big laughs with his silent comedy; the moment where he's showing off his tattoos is a riot. Clocking in at a tight 69 minutes, the movie maintains a fine forward momentum and builds towards a priceless finale where, among other things, Rufus fires on his own soldiers! Overall this is an absolute must for any comedy fan, as it starts brightly and keeps coming up with enough witty exchanges to make for very pleasant viewing. Nine out of 10.",9,2,4,19 June 2012
Rocky IV," There's no easy way out. There's no shortcut home.
","Rocky Balboa (Sly Stallone) is once again doing what he does best, and this time there's more at stake in the grand scheme of things. He's set to fight an imposing, superhuman Russian (Dolph Lundgren, in his big breakthrough role), all in the name of avenging a friends' untimely death and fighting for the greater glory of the U.S. of A.The formula in these films still works wonders, with Sly in fine form. He's as affable as he's ever been, and functioning as writer, director & star, he came up with an effectively simple, straightforward story. There's no deep thinking with an audience-pleaser like this one, you just go with the good vibes and are more than willing to root for the underdog for another round. Many of Rocky's friends and family have their doubts as to how well he'll fare against a monster like Lundgren, but as he sees it, THIS is what Rocky does. He's damn good at it, and by God, he's going to persevere.Sly does know just how to push our buttons, and does it with style. A fair bit of the running time here is devoted to montage; the best one showcases the contrasting methods of training for Sly and Lundgren. The latter has all manner of technology available to him, while Rocky goes completely old-school. And even with all the montage, this may be the shortest Rocky film to date at just an hour and 32 minutes.Rocky's support system - wife Adrian (Talia Shire, looking the best she's looked in this series), comedy relief brother in law Paulie (Burt Young), corner man Duke (Tony Burton) - continue to supply goodwill for the viewers. Lundgren is a true physical specimen as the cold-blooded villain, even if he doesn't have much of a character to play. Brigitte Nielsen is adequate as his wife. Michael Pataki is good as a Russian braggart. But it's Carl Weathers as Apollo who gives the best performance; Apollo is out to prove to himself and to others that he's NOT over the hill and still has plenty of fight in him.The rousing rock & pop soundtrack and Vince DiColas' score do help to get you in a fired-up mood. And the editing (by John W. Wheeler and Don Zimmerman) is first-rate.Good fun for series fans.However: the less said about the robot, the better.Seven out of 10.",7,1,1,1 February 2019
Being John Malkovich," To be Malkovich, or not to be Malkovich. That is the question.
","John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a nerdy puppeteer who goes to work as a file clerk. While at the office, he accidentally discovers a portal into the mind of the famed actor John Malkovich. This allows people who enter the portal to temporarily (for 15 minutes) experience the world through Malkovich's eyes. Craig finds that he really enjoys the experience, but his mousy, pet-obsessed wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) loves it even more. Craig and co-worker Maxine (a sexy, memorable Catherine Keener) decide that they're going to exploit his find for everything that it's worth. This leads to various unforeseen circumstances.Written by the talented Charlie Kaufman, this is clearly one of the cleverest, most original feature film ideas to come down the Hollywood pike over the last 25 years. Directed with gusto by the equally talented Spike Jonze, a veteran of commercials and music videos making his feature debut, it's an engrossing, one of a kind journey. It turns decidedly darker in its second half, which requires some adjustment on the part of the viewer, but it never ceases to be interesting - and, of course, very funny at times. Malkovich himself in particular is a hoot, but the whole cast is great. Orson Bean plays Craig's boss, a genial, paternal figure, if also irreverent at times. Mary Kay Place is the amusing 'secretary' at his office. Diaz is sympathetic in what was, at the time, a change-of-pace deglamorized role for her. Cusack shines in one of his more immersive performances, as a character who ultimately comes off as pathetic. Pay close attention to briefly see film director David Fincher on screen (he plays Christopher Bing).Kaufmans' script is quite entertaining, and proves to be involving every step of the way (it's more than just a 'gimmick' movie). The most laudable element about it is its unpredictability: the viewer can't be 100% sure of where it's going much of the time. One definite highlight: characters chasing each other through what is supposed to be Malkovich's subconscious.Nicely scored by Carter Burwell, this runs close to two hours but NEVER gets boring, the mark of a truly great film.Nine out of 10.",9,0,0,23 February 2020
Collateral," Enlivened by on-target star performances.
","Working from an intriguing screenplay by Stuart Beattie, producer / director Michael Mann offers up a crime thriller with a nice twist, with a dazzling array of Los Angeles locations and cityscapes serving as the backdrop, all of it very well shot by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron in a hi-def digital format. Tom Cruise plays Vincent, a hit-man from out of town called in to eliminate a quintet of characters. He has easygoing cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx) drive him around, and forces him to become an unwilling 'partner' when things start going wrong. And this is where 'Collateral' is the strongest, at portraying this antagonistic and yet compelling relationship. As we will see, Vincent is very cold blooded and ruthless when it comes to his trade, but at many turns he works at understanding his new acquaintance and trying to manipulate his life. Try as he might, Max has a very hard time breaking free from this sociopathic creep; they're pretty much bound together for a long and eventful night. This is also that refreshing variety of genre picture where the action supplements the story rather than the other way around. There are some pretty brutal and visceral scenes, but they never take over. The only time that the film ceases to be less than satisfying is when it turns conventional for its last act, turning Max into a hero all alone in his struggle with the bad guy. Still, it's worth noting that Max is not a hero from the beginning: his resolve has to grow as initially he feels impotent and useless. Vincent is also able to see through Max and realize that the cabbie's big dreams of starting up a limousine company may never come to fruition. After all, he may claim his taxi driving job is temporary, but he has been doing it for a dozen years...Foxx's performance is believable, and one is able to sympathize with him. The real surprise here is Cruise, who completely inhabits the role of the killer. You can actually forget you're watching a Cruise performance here; he's that good. The strong supporting cast includes Jada Pinkett Smith, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Berg, Bruce McGill, Irma P. Hall, and Barry Shabaka Henley, with Javier Bardem contributing a riveting, memorable cameo as a crime lord and Jason Statham appearing fleetingly at the start of the story. In addition, Mann turns the city of L.A. into something of a character itself, taking full advantage of many of its locations. Overall, this is a good, solid diversion, one that really does keep one watching and interested to see how things will develop. It begins in a calm, deliberate fashion, but the tension is soon wound up and the story moves forward faster and faster. Well worth watching for fans of the stars and the director.

Dark City," A movie of both style and substance.
","Director Alex Proyas, who'd previously directed the feature film version of 'The Crow', brings a similar comic book style to this intriguing movie that injects a noir sensibility into an elaborate science fiction environment. Its visuals are very impressive, and at the same time that this movie is entertaining you it's making you think about certain aspects of human existence. Rufus Sewell is excellent as John Murdoch, an average Joe who wakes up in a bathtub with no memory of who he is; soon, mysterious entities named Strangers will be tailing him, as will the police, who believe him to be a murderer. The Strangers, it turns out, are fooling around with human memories, determined to get to the root of who and what we are as humans. They're fascinated by us, and keep this world in perpetual night. Production design, by George Liddle and Patrick Tatopoulos, is incredible, as is the cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. The pacing is very deliberate, but the story is compelling enough that one may not mind being guided through it carefully; there are action set pieces and special effects, but they're parcelled out a bit at a time. There is a certain grandeur to it all, as one can see from the lair of The Strangers, and the audience will also have a fun time absorbing the various plot twists that Proyas and fellow screenwriters Lem Dobbs and David S. Goyer come up with. The twist with the reality behind mysterious location Shell Beach is particularly effective. The acting is solid from all concerned, with Jennifer Connelly as Murdochs' wife, William Hurt as the intrepid detective who's just as puzzled as the hero, Richard O'Brien, Ian Richardson, and Bruce Spence as the very creepy principal Strangers, Colin Friels as harried ex-detective Walenski, Melissa George as the prostitute May, and Kiefer Sutherland in a very amusing, Peter Lorre-like turn as the stressed out doctor who knows a great deal about the reality of the situation facing everybody. In the end, this is provocative stuff that successfully deals with the issue of human identity; is it our memories that do indeed define who we are, or is there so much more to it than that? Many science fiction films over the years have dealt with the idea of what makes us human, and 'Dark City' admirably keeps up that tradition. Worth a watch for discerning genre fans.

The Amazing Spider-Man," Don't go out of your way to see this one.
","Just 10 years after the first official big screen adaptation of the legendary Spider-Man comic book, Sony saw fit to reboot the series, with another rehashing of the now familiar origin story. Granted, it plays out with some minor differences, but the end result is pretty much the same.Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield, inheriting the role from Tobey Maguire) is a high school photographer with an aptitude for science as well. He makes the acquaintance of Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), a scientist who was working with Peters' father (Campbell Scott, in a VERY brief cameo). Connors' experiments go seriously awry when he injects himself with a serum derived from lizards, and therefore becomes The Lizard, one of Spidey's familiar nemeses. Peter, who's acquired superhuman abilities after being bitten by a genetically enhanced arachnid, realizes that it's his duty to stop him.One might as well watch the 2002 film with Maguire, since these filmmakers don't bring anything truly fresh to this material. There's the usual smorgasbord of CGI effects (although director Marc Webb and company supposedly wanted as many practical stunts as possible), and mayhem. The writing isn't particularly good, and indeed some of the dialogue can be rather cringe-inducing. Worst of all, the film makes a waste of some of its acting talent, giving old pros like Sally Field (as Aunt May) and Martin Sheen (as the ill-fated Uncle Ben) little to do. At least Peters' love interest, Gwen Stacy (a radiant Emma Stone), gets to do her own bit during the heroism of the final act. As for Pete / Spidey, Garfield comes off better once in costume and incapacitating bad guys, nailing some of the cockiness of the character. Ifans is good as the well-intentioned (or is he, really?) antagonist who becomes the monster. Denis Leary is okay as a Captain Stacy who criticizes the efforts of this 'masked vigilante'. And Stan Lee, naturally, has his usual cameo.If the prospective viewer is a superhero / comic book adaptation junkie, they may derive some entertainment out of this, as unnecessary as it all is. Some of the cast members helped raise this viewers' rating by a point, anyway.Followed by one more Spidey movie with Garfield; this film is dedicated to the late Laura Ziskin (producer) and J. Michael Riva (production designer).Six out of 10.",6,0,1,28 December 2019
Aliens," One of Camerons' finest moments.
","Writer / director James Cameron follows up Ridley Scotts' groundbreaking and well loved sci- fi / horror masterpiece with this energetic, elaborate, and emotionally charged sequel that becomes part action movie, to great effect. Sigourney Weaver does such a fine job of reprising her iconic Ellen Ripley role that she got an Oscar nomination for best actress, not something that happens too often for genre films. It may not be as innovative as Scotts' film, but it's still got plenty of atmosphere and tension and keeps your interest even though it's very long for this sort of thing (with the theatrical version running 137 minutes and the special edition coming in even longer at 155 minutes). 30 years later, it maintains its status as one of the most popular and enjoyed films of its type.The story picks up long after the events of the first 'Alien' - 57 years, to be exact, as that's how long Ripley has been drifting through space in her escape pod. She finds out that the planet that she and her crew visited so long ago has now been colonized. Ripley is wary of the set-up, and it comes as no surprise to her when all contact is lost with the colony. A squad of Marines is sent there to take care of the problem, with Ripley trying to face her worst fears by tagging along in an advisory capacity. What happened is soon made clear: the colony was overwhelmed by a multitude of monsters of the same variety that she once encountered. These Marines are supposedly total badasses who pack superior firepower, but it remains to be seen if they will prove to be a match for the aliens at all.First-rate, Oscar winning special effects are just one highlight of an intense movie that does have a lot of set-up to get through, but once it reaches its fever pitch, it's just a hell of a lot of fun. There's one effective set piece after another, although it could be argued that there's at least one climax too many. What does give the story resonance is the motivation behind the character of Ripley, as she morphs from traumatized, haunted individual to an ass kicking female Rambo, determined to save the life of the colony's sole survivor, a little girl (Carrie Henn, memorable in her only film performance). Weaver is wonderful and well supported by a cast full of people who are now very familiar faces, including Cameron regulars Michael Biehn (as the calm and reliable Corporal Hicks), Lance Henriksen (as the helpful android Bishop), and Bill Paxton (as initially cocky and ultimately cowardly Private Hudson). Paul Reiser shows off his dramatic abilities by playing one of the slimiest cinematic corporate villains of all time. Other scene stealers include Al Matthews, Jenette Goldstein, and Mark Rolston.While it does take a while to get to these scenes, the best ones tend to involve the towering Alien Queen, which is a real sight to behold, particularly as she's created using old school marionette effects when nowadays we all know she'd largely be rendered using CGI.One solid bit of business is the slight element of mystery when Ripley and the Marines first arrive on the planet. We see the devastation resulting from a horrible battle, and can only imagine what it must have been like.As good a sequel that could have been made, some fans do appreciate how it goes off on its own path and scores. It's equal parts exciting and suspenseful.Eight out of 10.",8,1,2,2 July 2013
Goon," 'Take the number 69, it's hilarious!'
","Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott, the 'American Pie' series) is a slow witted and big hearted kind of guy without much ambition. He toils away as a bouncer in a bar, and it's when he manhandles a player while watching a hockey game that a coach (Nicholas Campbell, 'Da Vinci's Inquest') realizes his great potential for being an 'enforcer'. Doug is taught just enough hockey skills to get by, and is sent to the Halifax Highlanders, where he's watched over by coach Ronnie Hortense (Kim Coates, 'Sons of Anarchy') and is made to look out for star player Xavier LaFlamme (Marc-Andre Grondin, 'C.R.A.Z.Y.'). A legendary tough guy of the game, Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber, the 'Scream' series) is soon to retire, and he sees Doug as the inheritor to his throne. And nice guy Doug falls in love with a young woman (Alison Pill, 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World') who has her own self-esteem issues.'Goon' is co-written and co-produced by supporting actor Jay Baruchel ('She's Out of My League') as a comic and yet heartfelt celebration of the violent side of hockey, brought to vivid life with a lot of bloody brutality. Inspired by real-life player Doug Smith (you see footage of him during the end credits), it actually, genuinely cares about its characters, which is appreciated, and gives weight to the saga. It ultimately tells a very familiar misfit makes good formula, and while it may hold no surprises, it's suitably rousing just the same. Moreover, you can tell this was made by people who are actually big fans of the game, and they do get the 'feel' just right.Truth be told, the story thread regarding Doug as the black sheep of his family (both his dad (comedy legend Eugene Levy of 'SCTV' fame) and his brother are doctors) IS under-developed. Levy ends up with very little to do in the grand scheme of things. But some viewers may still enjoy how well paced the movie is and how well it cuts to the chase.The whole cast is great, and they add to the good vibes. Scott, in particular, is a standout, showing that there's much more to him than Steve Stifler and Steve Stifler-type roles. Schreiber is amusing as his nemesis, Pill is appealing, and Baruchel is a real live wire as Dougs' best bud. Curt Keilback is quite funny as the announcer for the games.While not exactly memorable in any way, 'Goon' gets the blood pumping (and flowing) for a slick hour and a half. Michael Dowse (the 'FUBAR' films, 'It's All Gone, Pete Tong') directs, with engaging results.Seven out of 10.",7,1,1,12 July 2018
Saw III," Gripping visceral entertainment.
","Third entry in the popular Lionsgate franchise of intense and graphic 'torture' films catches us up to speed before soon diving into another insane Jigsaw mixture of heavy handed moralizing and brutal punishment. This time, we get two main concurrent story lines, as Jigsaws' prot√©g√© Amanda (Shawnee Smith) kidnaps a weary doctor, Lynn (Bahar Soomekh) whose purpose is to keep his sorry ass alive for as long as possible, and the latest in the line of unwilling game players turns out to be Jeff (Angus Macfadyen). Jeff lost his son when the latter was killed by a drunken driver, and he's been consumed with rage and a need for vengeance ever since. So, as we can see, Jigsaws' latest lesson to a slow learner is not to let hatred poison ones' heart. These story lines create a pretty compelling story that keeps one glued to the screen, and things get just mean spirited enough to appeal to some tastes if not all. Of course, the torture devices get more and more elaborate and sadistic, which will absolutely delight gore fanatics, as various extremely unpleasant things happen to a succession of victims. There's a strikingly detailed brain operation, a head that blows up real good, a body being drowned in pig innards, throats being sliced, body parts being mangled, bloody gunshot wounds, etc. The 'rack' is particularly insidious, especially as it twists body parts around. One unfortunate thing is that assorted flashback scenes tend to bog the story down; they're good for establishing character, but also slow the pace too much. This is a noticeably long entry in the franchise, the theatrical cut running 108 minutes and the uncut version running 13 minutes longer than that. Another thing that could trouble some viewers with this franchise is a lack of sympathetic characters, although others may appreciate the fact / point that the people in these stories are markedly flawed and not perfect. The crew, including production designer David Hackl and cinematographer David Armstrong, once again prove up to the challenge of shooting in some claustrophobic sets, and things look as grim and grimy as they ever have. The cast is deeply committed as per usual, including Tobin Bell as the sickly Jigsaw, hot 80s icon Betsy Russell in the first of her performances as Jigsaws' wife, and series regulars like Dina Meyer, Costas Mandylor, and Lyriq Bent. Series fans should like what they see, while the faint of heart and weak of stomach should stay far away. Seven out of 10.",7,0,2,7 October 2012
Die Hard 2," A non-stop thrill ride.
","'Die Hard 2' is a good example of the 'bigger is better' philosophy when it comes to making Hollywood sequels. Superhero cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) once again proves to be a pain in the ass to terrorists everywhere, kicking ass all over the place in his usual gruff, tough style. He's way ahead of every other character here, realizing something is about to go down while waiting for his wifes' plane to land at Washington, D.C.s' Dulles Airport. He doesn't get too much for his trouble other than a lot of grief (most of it from an airport security chief (Dennis Franz) who's a carbon copy of the incompetent moron played by Paul Gleason in the first film). The villain is a powerful dictator / drug dealer played by international icon Franco Nero, who's helped by traitorous American lowlifes led by William Sadlers' crazed Colonel Stuart.Director Renny Harlin had already proved his worth directing such horror movies as the effective 'Prison' and the financially successful fourth 'Nightmare on Elm Street' movie and shows here how well he can handle large scale action. There's plenty of thrills, plenty of violence, and plenty of tension. The only real issue with the movie is credibility; however, while it requires much suspension of disbelief, it does pay the viewer back by delivering testosterone-laden entertainment and never really letting up. The special effects and stunts are spectacular, and the interplay between Willis and his supporting cast is fun stuff.Some veterans of the first 'Die Hard' return, namely Bonnie Bedelia as McClanes' wife Holly, William Atherton as self serving arrogant s.o.b. reporter Dick Thornberg and Reginald VelJohnson (who has little more than a cameo) as McClanes' friend and fellow cop Al Powell. New faces include John Amos, Art Evans, Fred Dalton Thompson, Tom Bower, Sheila McCarthy, and Don Harvey. Sadler has got to be the most fun; he's a cold blooded monster and also a bad ass who can definitely handle McClane in a fight. The lineup of familiar actors in small roles is amazing; among them: Robert Patrick, John Leguizamo, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Mark Boone Junior, Tom Everett, Colm Meaney, and Robert Costanzo.As before, Michael Kamens' music is quite rousing, and the reprise of the Vaughan Monroe rendition of 'Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!' provides another pleasant reminder of 'Die Hard' 1. The script by Steven E. de Souza and Doug Richardson (based on the novel '58 Minutes' by Walter Wager) contains a fair bit of humour and that deliciously profane dialogue that we all love so much.Overall, this is agreeable escapism, and a fine follow up to one of the modern action classics.Eight out of 10.",8,0,1,8 December 2012
Independence Day," It's the end of the world as we know it, and we sure do feel fine.
","'Independence Day' is one of those blockbusters where we know we're basically in it for the spectacle. Yeah, the writing ain't so hot, the dialogue is silly, and some of the performances are indeed broad, but does all of that really matter when the action is as slick and high tech and impressive visually as it is in this over the top movie? We know we're in for a good time right from the start when we get a sense of how enormous that alien mother ship is. The story, for those of us who may not have already seen this, is basically an update of films like 'Earth vs. the Flying Saucers', 'The War of the Worlds', and 'Star Wars', with state of the art special effects. Thoroughly evil aliens hover giant city destroying spaceships over Earths' major cities, apparently ready to do some damage, and the human race seemingly can't do much. U.S. President Bill Pullman keeps trying to figure out the best options, even as the stakes keep changing. Among our other heroes are a swaggering Will Smith as an Air Force pilot and Jeff Goldblum as the nerdy computer expert who finds out how to sneak past the alien defenses. This reviewer will admit that this movie is a groaner at times (the whole story with Randy Quaids' character especially) but writer / producer Dean Devlin and writer / director Roland Emmerich serve up all of the major set pieces with flair. 'Independence Day' may be a long movie (145 minutes in its theatrical incarnation, 154 minutes in its extended version) but at least it's never boring. It's got a supporting cast just full of familiar faces, and the invading E.T.'s are such a loathsome bunch - they're compared to locusts - that one simply can't help but want to see the humans rise up and kick some damn ass. And eventually they get their chance, and in a development we certainly hope would extend to real life, all the countries of the world are united in their one single purpose. One particularly effective sequence occurs approximately half way through when an alien specimen is prematurely set up for an autopsy, and the entire sequence aboard the mother ship is a corker as well. Overall, this is good fun for anybody who'd just like to turn their brains off and enjoy some straightforward escapism. And, in conclusion...what's so wrong with a little rah rah flag waving?

No Country for Old Men," What's the most money you ever lost on a coin toss?
","Opinions do look to be sharply divided on this typically interesting effort for the Coen brothers. Some hail it a masterpiece, others don't see the appeal at all. While this viewer doesn't quite fit into the former camp, he will say that it's one of the more unconventional examples of crime fiction that one is likely to see. It's much more of a character piece than anything, with some grisly scenes of violence here and there. Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, it centres around three characters, one being a poor hunter named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who one day stumbles into the aftermath of some drug deal gone horribly wrong. He finds $2 million on the scene and impulsively decides to keep the money for himself, while a mysterious, creepy, sadistic stranger named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) tracks him down, porting a unique pressurized air weapon. Somewhat involved is a weary Texas sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who's unsettled by what he sees as the changing times. Now, granted, what's going to test the patience of some of the viewers are some of the monologues; this isn't for people who want a straightforward story and who are turned off by philosophical musings. One can hardly fail to notice how low key most of this narrative is; even in the more intense scenes there's never really a sense of urgency. On the plus side, what we do get are some excellent character moments from the solid star trio of Brolin, Bardem, and Jones. The supporting cast is equally impressive - Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, Barry Corbin, Stephen Root, and Beth Grant. The Coens work with some of their reliable prior collaborators such as composer Carter Burwell and cinematographer Roger Deakins. All things considered, 'No Country for Old Men' may not be to all tastes, and does require some patience on the part of the viewer. It also doesn't resolve itself in the way one might expect for this genre, and might prove to be less than satisfactory in this regard for some of those watching. There's one fantastic confrontation near the end, but the film closes, curiously enough, after a monologue by Bell about a dream he's had. How much or how little all of this works will be up to the individual viewer. In any event, the actors are all fantastic, especially Bardem, and they make the journey worthwhile.

Days of Thunder," Duvall raises this rating by a point.
","The star, producers, and director of 'Top Gun' reteam for another story in which Tom Cruise is the cocky young hotshot determined to prove himself to the world. This time, he's a race car driver named Cole Trickle (what were they thinking with THAT name?), taken under the wing of a veteran crew chief and car builder, Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall). Cole definitely has a lot to learn, and he even admits to Harry that he knows precious little about cars, despite having a talent at driving them.If you love cars and you love racing, you'll have a head start on other viewers when it comes to this ultra-slick, loud, but VERY predictable action-drama. It's completely lacking in any sort of suspense. Even when Cole is critically injured in a major crash, the viewer has no doubt that he'll be back in racing form in record time.As can be expected, all the race track action is first rate: well shot and well edited. It's an exceptionally good looking picture, with colours that just pop off the screen. There's a romantic subplot where Cole develops a lust for the sexy young neurosurgeon (Nicole Kidman) who helped to save his life; Cruise and Kidman work well together and it's not a surprise that they would become a real-life couple.Ultimately, it's a first rate cast that really makes this worth seeing. Able support is provided by Randy Quaid, Cary Elwes, John C. Reilly, and Michael Rooker, the latter playing Coles' race track nemesis who eventually becomes his friend. Other familiar faces (Fred Thompson, J.C. Quinn, Caroline Williams, Margo Martindale) turn up, with producer Don Simpson appearing on screen as Aldo Bennedetti. But it's Duvall who is the true MVP of this production. He's just a pleasure to watch.'Days of Thunder' is largely visceral entertainment that basically works on a mindless level, with Cruise flashing his smile at any and every opportunity.Screenplay by Robert Towne, based on a story by him and Cruise.Seven out of 10.",7,0,0,27 June 2020
Liar Liar," My favourite Jim Carrey comedy.
","True enough that 'Liar Liar' isn't exactly original - see also the 1941 Bob Hope vehicle 'Nothing But the Truth' - and that it's ultimately formulaic Hollywood stuff, but when Carrey is on fire, this movie is just riotous. He indulges in some memorable rubber-face and body contorting gags, all in the name of laughs. The script, by Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, allows him some great opportunities to improvise and bring the house down.He plays Fletcher Reede, a hotshot attorney with a tendency to lie a LOT. And he's good at it, too. Unfortunately, this leads to him upsetting his young son Max (adorable Justin Cooper) one too many times, and the neglected boy makes a birthday wish that his dad will be unable to lie for 24 hours. Naturally, the wish comes true, and Fletcher suffers one major episode after another as he struggles to get through an important divorce case without resorting to falsehoods.Most everybody else here plays the straight man (or woman, as the case may be) to the energetic star. They help to ground the story in *some* level of reality, although by the big action climax, things go completely over the top. One good touch in the movie is to not portray the new man in the ex-wife's life as a villain, i.e. someone she obviously shouldn't be with. There may be a little too much sentiment here for some folks' tastes, but there's still plenty of shtick and good lines to enjoy, such as Fletcher beating himself up in a public restroom, his various bouts of truth telling, and his 'roasting' of his fellow employees. Carrey is ably supported by such fine actors and actresses as Maura Tierney, Jennifer Tilly, Swoosie Kurtz, Amanda Donohoe, Cary Elwes, Jason Bernard, Mitch Ryan, Anne Haney, and a briefly seen Cheri Oteri.Very funny overall, with the closing credits outtakes adding to the 'feel good' vibes.Dedicated to the late Bernard, who died on the last day of filming.Eight out of 10.",8,0,1,28 December 2013
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," One of the most entertaining movies that I've seen in a long time.
","With hicks and horror having made such good bedfellows for such a long time, it's only natural that the concept should be exploited for its comedic value, and 'Tucker and Dale vs. Evil' is brilliant in this regard.Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine are the title characters, two likable good ol' boys who just want to relax and have a good time at their newly acquired vacation retreat, a run down old rural cabin. Into their lives come some rowdy college kids who get the wrong impression of Tucker & Dale, even more so when one of their own, Allison (Katrina Bowden), has an accident. Tucker & Dale come to her rescue, and the kids, having already formed their opinions of the pair, interpret the event negatively. As a result, they keep launching assaults on poor Tucker & Dale that end badly, with the kids managing to gruesomely kill themselves over and over in the process.'Tucker and Dale vs. Evil' is extremely bright, engaging, and knowing comedy taking a delightfully satiric approach to standard genre filmmaking. Granted, by nature of its story, it eventually, understandably turns into the very thing it's making fun of, but it's still very entertaining right from beginning to end. Not only does it make fun of certain stereotypes, but peoples' own preconceived notions, which can well be formed by the weight of so many straight faced movies of this kind. And it even works in a heartfelt message about self-esteem into its mix with real deftness.Written by director Eli Craig and co-producer Morgan Jurgenson, this is high energy filmmaking that's often breathless enough, and compulsively watchable, that one may truly not notice the time passing, it's that enjoyable. What's great is how well Craig and Jurgenson set things up just so they can be misunderstood, such as the incident with the bees. The movie doesn't skimp on the gore, either, but it's always spun in such a funny fashion; as soon as we see that wood chipper, we're primed and ready to see it in action, and when we do, the result is uproarious.Actors Tudyk and Labine, two engaging guys who really ought to see their stars rise after this, are perfect as Tucker & Dale. The lovely Bowden is an immensely appealing actress playing an immensely appealing character, who by the way, is another case of embodying the whole idea of there being more to an individual than meets the eye. And Jesse Moss is a real hoot as the demented frat boy hellbent on going after Tucker & Dale; he's in for a very apt revelation that he couldn't have anticipated.And, in closing, while the whole 'therapy' session does slow things down a bit, it's quite revelatory itself - how often in this sort of story do we actually see the opponents actually engage in a bit of (hopefully) civil airing of grievances?Craig and his wife Sasha play the cameraman and reporter in the pre-credits sequence.Nine out of 10.",9,8,10,13 January 2012
It Follows," Eerie and well acted.
","Not bad modern horror film represents a respectable effort from writer, producer & director David Robert Mitchell. It's been compared to John Carpenters' work, which is appropriate. In the opening shots, we feel as if we're back in Haddonfield, Illinois (this was actually shot in Detroit). Mitchell gives us a very strange and interesting set piece to open his film, and he and his cast try very hard at giving us characters we can care about. 'It Follows' may pose a challenge to some members of its audience by daring to take its time. Mitchell holds off on increasing the momentum as long as he can, preferring to create a gloomy atmosphere and a constant sense of creeping dread. This he all does without dwelling too long on graphic violence, which some horror fans may appreciate.The premise is fairly interesting. Some sort of supernatural force - which is always changing its appearance - kind of attaches itself to certain individuals and follows them around, terrorizing them. Sometimes it even kills them. Our imperiled heroine Jay (Maika Monroe) is the latest person to attract this 'it', and her deeply concerned friends agree to help see her through the experience.Folks will dig on the old style synthesizer score by Disasterpeace, and appreciate the widescreen compositions devised by Mitchell and his cinematographer, Mike Gioulakis. They take full advantage of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio.The acting is low key and sincere from the attractive young cast. Monroe is a personable lead, and she's ably supported by Keir Gilchrist ('Dead Silence'), Daniel Zovatto ('Beneath'), Jake Weary ('Zombeavers'), and Olivia Luccardi.The ending fails to be very satisfying, unfortunately. This is too bad, considering how well Mitchell creates his mood and feel for about 80% of the film.This viewer wasn't quite blown away by 'It Follows' but would consider it good enough to merit a viewing from genre fans.Seven out of 10.",7,9,18,27 July 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Not without flaws, but overall quite potent and entertaining.
","An iconic series is brought into the 21st century with engaging results. Starting from square one, it shows how a dedicated researcher, Will Rodman (James Franco), is desperate to create a cure for Alzheimers', which is afflicting his father (ever solid John Lithgow). He is experimenting on chimpanzees, and the ultimate result is a super intelligent chimp whom he names Caesar (motion capture expert Andy Serkis). Caesar ends up in an animal shelter where he is treated terribly by a sadistic employee (Tom Felton of the 'Harry Potter' series). He ends up so disillusioned with the human race that he motivates his fellow primates to stage an uprising.For quite a while, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is so emotionally involving, and riveting, that it really keeps you watching. You genuinely sympathize with a lot of the characters, and also naturally come to hate characters such as a stereotypically greedy corporation bigwig (David Oyelowo), the nasty Dodge (Felton), and the hostile neighbor Hunsiker (David Hewlett). The apes may be digitally rendered in what is now standard practice, but thanks to the human actors helping to bring them to life, you can see a definite depth of emotion in their eyes and expressions. Serkis has certainly become an absolute master at this brand of performing.The film does go a little heavy on the effects, and may strike some people as being pretty manipulative. Still, there's no denying its potency, which does help to make up for any drawbacks, such as the over the top, utterly conventional action climax.Franco does a decent job in the lead, but Freida Pinto is given little to do as his love interest. Lithgow does an excellent job, as could be expected. Overall, the human cast does creditable work: Brian Cox, Tyler Labine, Jamie Harris, Ty Olsson, etc.What will be fun for veteran fans of this series will be the little nods to previous movies along the way, including THAT legendary line of dialogue from Charlton Heston.Seven out of 10.",7,1,1,22 July 2017
Get Out," Behold. The Coagula.
","The amiable Daniel Kaluuya gives an enjoyable breakthrough performance as Chris Washington, a young black artist dating white girl Rose Armitage (Allison Williams). Five months into the relationship, and it's time to meet her parents. They live in a back of the beyond universe populated almost exclusively by whites, along with a few black people who behave quite strangely. Chris will discover some nefarious doings by Roses' mom and pop (Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford) and these other members of the white elite. Will he be able to 'get out' of this situation before it's too late?Overall, the filmmaking debut for sketch comedian Jordan Peele is a respectable, if not great, effort to blend some commentary on racial relations with a tried and true, formulaic Hollywood thriller. This viewer could point out the film that seems to have inspired Peele the most, but that would be along the lines of a spoiler. While the film is technically well made and well paced, and builds towards an appropriately visceral finale, it is troubling in some ways. Its 'mystery' is easy to figure out (Hell, Chris' seemingly paranoid friend Rod (LilRel Howery) may actually be on to something), and the characters are pretty 'black and white', if you'll pardon the expression. Undoubtedly, the film is perfect at being manipulative, with villains whose violent comeuppance is the ultimate catharsis.The cast provides most of the value. Williams is good as the girlfriend who, at first, tries to have you wondering 'is she or isn't she'. Old pros like Keener, Whitford, Stephen Root, and Richard Herd do as much as they can with cliched roles. The lively and profane Howery is quite amusing. Caleb Landry Jones dials up the seediness to 11 in his role as Roses' loutish brother Jeremy.As this viewer said, the scenario is likely to get the blood of some audience members boiling, but it could have used a bit more restraint. It's certainly entertaining to a degree, and clearly it did hit a nerve with the movie-going public, even garnering some Oscar nominations.Six out of 10.",6,20,39,18 February 2018
Drive," Not bad, but overly self-indulgent.
","Director Nicolas Winding Refns' film of the James Sallis novel makes for fairly good entertainment. The basic story is decent, but Refn takes it all just a little too seriously, and his pacing will likely test the patience of some viewers. He really loves to stretch out his moments. He and his star Ryan Gosling work overtime to give both the film and the unnamed main character a sense of cool, but overall the main character just isn't that interesting, despite the fact that he can morph from soft spoken dude to brutal bad ass at the drop of a dime. Still, it's all attractively shot on various L.A. locations, and the supporting cast makes it worth watching. The brief bursts of graphic violence are a little jarring, but this viewer personally doesn't have a problem with that sort of thing.Made sort of in the style of Walter Hills' under-rated 1978 thriller 'The Driver', 'Drive' stars Gosling as a young man who clearly likes to keep busy, functioning as a part-time mechanic, a part-time car stunt specialist for the movies, and a part-time getaway driver for hire. Usually a careful individual, he only buys himself trouble when he becomes attracted to Irene (Carey Mulligan), who lives in his building with a young son, Benicio (Kaden Leos). Irenes' former jailbird husband 'Standard' (Oscar Isaac) is in trouble with goons who are trying to force him to take a robbery gig; The Driver oddly decides to do Standard a favour and participate in the robbery. Of course, things don't go as planned.The film does benefit from the kind of pulse quickening action scenes that you would expect from any film titled 'Drive'. Some of the dialogue is punchy, and delivered to perfection by co-star Albert Brooks, who has fun with a good part as a gangster. Bryan Cranston of 'Breaking Bad' fame is also excellent as The Drivers' friend at the garage. Ron Perlman is typically amusing as Brooks's associate, and it's nice to see screen veteran Russ Tamblyn ('West Side Story', 'The Haunting') in a brief appearance. Mulligan is both cute and appealing as the female lead.'Drive' is ultimately much more of a character driven crime drama than action film in the end, and while some may find it too slow and too pretentious, it does adequately entertain with a number of good moments, and the performances help to keep it watchable.Six out of 10.",6,3,6,15 August 2013
Insidious," A good, solid spook show.
","'Insidious', at first glance, seems like it might just be a retread of the classic films that influenced it, such as 'Poltergeist' (obviously) and 'The Entity'. (It even has actress Barbara Hershey, who'd starred in the latter film.) But fortunately screenwriter / co-star Leigh Whannell and director James Wan do some interesting things with the premise, and prevent it from becoming a cheese fest. They create some bona fide atmosphere and chills here; 'Insidious' is definitely for the horror fan bemoaning the focus on gore and cheap thrills in more recent genre fare. It's got a number of 'jump' moments, but they actually work, most of the time, because they're not expected. And it's all acted with the utmost sincerity by a good cast.Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne star as Josh and Renai Lambert, a young couple settling into their new house with two boys and an infant girl in tow. After the son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) takes a spill in the attic, he soon slips into what seems to be a coma but is something different altogether. After supernatural experiences begin to be too much for Renai to bear, Josh's mother Lorraine (Hershey) calls in a medium friend of hers named Elise (horror veteran Lin Shaye). But things only get worse after that. Josh learns that it's up to him to resolve matters.Whannell (who plays the part of 'Specs') and Wan deserve some credit for creating a film that genuinely manages to creep a viewer out. Wan takes his time, doling out the imagery carefully, bit by bit, until the big finale where an alternate dimension dubbed by Elise as 'The Further' must be entered. And even when the story requires its primary demon (played by Joseph Bishara, the films' composer) to be shown a little more, the character doesn't lose that much effectiveness. Certainly one successful element is the convincing enough creation of disturbing surrealism in many scenes. (And the song 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' is made even more creepy than it already was.) Wilson and Byrne are easy to sympathize with as the parents, and it's always a delight to see Shaye and Hershey in anything. Child actor Simpkins does alright in his role.Clearly, the film is designed to end the way that it does in order to set up the sequel, but it does leave one wanting more.Seven out of 10.",7,0,1,19 October 2013
The Mist," Has its share of both flaws and assets.
","Movie poster artist David Drayton (Thomas Jane), together with his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) and assorted others, is trapped inside a supermarket the day after a huge storm. This storm, which may have something to do with an Army project dubbed 'Arrowhead', has created an ominous mist that blankets *everything*. That makes it scary enough to venture outside, but the mist is also concealing monsters - horrible, ugly, predatory monsters. While a short amount of time passes inside the supermarket, people start losing their minds, forming little groups while some get spurred on by religious fanatic Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden).The best way to view this creature feature is with writer / director Frank Darabonts' preferred black & white version, which is intended to function as something of a throwback to the b & w monster movies made by Universal and other studios in the 1950s. Here, the special effects come off the best and the atmosphere is undeniable. Darabont, adapting the novella by Stephen King for the screen, does well at creating tension and suspense. Once the things start to crawl out of the woodwork, the sense of mystery dissipates, but at least there is some good action to enjoy when this happens.Carried over from Kings' story is an overriding dose of social commentary, specifically the idea that humanity ceases to mean much in times of extreme stress and danger. This may seem to some people as being very cynical, but this viewer can't help but agree.Unfortunately, not all of the dialogue is that hot, and Darabont appears to have used the worst possible take from most of the actors in most scenes. They've been much better utilized elsewhere. Harden does the best she can, trying not to turn Mrs. Carmody into an outright cartoon character or caricature. Jane is okay in the hero role but his hysterics at the end are utterly laughable. Frances Sternhagen is great fun as feisty old lady Irene Reppler, and Darabont works with some of his reliable old hands such as William Sadler, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Brian Libby. If fans of 'The Walking Dead' go and watch this now, they'll recognize 'Carol', a.k.a. Melissa McBride, as the mother in the supermarket.The ending here, significantly changed from the novella, is a matter of debate among many fans. Some find it all too effective and disturbing. This viewer, however, found it rather ludicrous.Overall, a flawed but still arresting bit of entertainment, due mostly to the scenario of a building under siege, a classic theme in the genre.Seven out of 10.",7,1,2,24 September 2014
The Elephant Man," 'Touching' doesn't begin to describe it.
","This wonderful, heartrending drama stands tall as one of the finest hours for filmmaker David Lynch and actors Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt. Hopkins stars as Frederick Treves, an eminent surgeon in Victorian era London. While attending a carnival, he becomes aware of the existence of a sideshow attraction, John Merrick (John Hurt). Merricks' face is grotesquely distorted due to a congenital disease, and Treves's heart goes out to the poor man. He tries to give Merrick every comfort he can, and for the first time in Merricks' life, he's treated with respect and caring by people. Of course, there will still be those damnable individuals who merely seek to exploit Merrick for their own selfish reasons.Hopkins is absolutely great, but it's Hurt who commands your attention, and for good reason. He plays Mr. Merrick as a kind, gentle soul, who struggles mightily to maintain some dignity yet has a heartbreaking vulnerability about him. He also does an impressive job of conveying emotion beneath the amazing cranial makeup devised by Christopher Tucker. Hopkins and Hurt are supported by a peerless, mostly British cast, although Anne Bancrofts' role as stage star Mrs. Kendal is really no more than an extended cameo. John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller are particularly fine as the supportive Mr. Carr Gomm and the head nurse Mothershead. And on the other side of the coin, where we see 'humanity' at its worst, we have solid performances by Freddie Jones as the possessive Mr. Bytes and Michael Elphick as the sleazy night porter.The film is well made in every respect, with Lynch and his crew creating a very rich and powerful period atmosphere. It's beautifully shot in black & white and Panavision by the great Freddie Francis, and receives a lovely music score by John Morris.Long but engrossing, 'The Elephant Man' earns its emotional responses from the audience in an honest and memorable way.Unrelated to any previous telling of the real-life story or to the Broadway play.10 out of 10.",10,1,1,13 May 2015
I Am Legend," It could have been great. Instead, it's just good.
","In 2009, a doctor named Alice Krippin (an unbilled Emma Thompson) develops what is supposedly a miracle cure for cancer. However, this so called 'cure' leads to an outbreak of a new disease that turns victims into photosensitive ghouls. Three years later, a lone military doctor named Robert Neville (Will Smith) seems to be the last human standing in a devastated, post apocalyptic NYC. His only companion is his faithful dog Sam (played by 'Abbey' and 'Kona'), while he avoids the creatures known as 'the dark seekers' and determinedly tries to find a cure for this plague.The third official screen adaptation of Richard Mathesons' novel 'I am Legend' is the first one to use that title, after 'The Last Man on Earth' (1964) and 'The Omega Man' (1971). Also drawing inspiration from the screenplay for 'The Omega Man', it's an acceptable horror- action mash up that works quite well for about two thirds of the running time. When it's mostly just Will and the dog(s), it's rather moving in its depiction of loneliness as well as devotion to mans' best friend. (There's also a theme here of rediscovering ones' faith.) The production design (by Naomi Shohan) and cinematography (by Andrew Lesnie) are first rate, in addition to the pretty convincing creation of an utterly desolate NYC. There's one powerful suspense sequence that sees Neville and Sam trapped inside a dark building. It also draws a lot from the screen presence and believability of Smith, who delivers a very affecting performance. Those dogs are wonderful, too.However, as it starts turning into a much more conventional action flick, it becomes decidedly less interesting. The dark seekers themselves are standard CGI / motion capture monsters, and while some people may enjoy the visceral thrills of various lively moments, there's simply not that much threat to be had from these things, except for an 'Alpha Male' (Dash Mihok), who's more aggressive than most of them. Overall, they're a pretty mindless horde.Reasonably entertaining, but it sure doesn't reach its full potential. Say what you will about 'The Omega Man' - at least the antagonists there had some personality.Seven out of 10.",7,1,2,16 January 2017
A Quiet Place," Silence is golden and lines are lousy.
","This movie earned some respect from this viewer right up front: it just THRUSTS you into the story. Usually, in post-apocalypse tales, the tendency is to utilize some back story or text to tell the audience how the world got to its current state. Not the case here. We follow a young family, played by real-life marrieds Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, and Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe as two of their children. Their main concern in this post-nuke Earth is trying to survive the wrath of some very weird creatures that appear to be blind and which hunt by sound. The sense of hearing on these creatures is so acute that our heroes have to take a lot of precautions, including going barefoot in the woods.There are some character decisions here that don't make sense, and the story too does not bear a lot of scrutiny, but when it comes to the horror aspect of the presentation, 'A Quiet Place' delivers. As expected, the sound design is quite good, and Krasinski, who also co-wrote, co-executive produced, and directed, builds some considerable suspense. The family themselves aren't always THAT smart, but they're surprisingly sympathetic for modern horror movie characters. You actually care what happens to them. Plus, it's definitely of some interest to have a script where much of the dialogue is conveyed through sign language, and where our heroes have their work cut out for them trying not to make too much noise.The performances are right on the money and very effective, from personable leads Blunt and Krasinski and Simmonds and Jupe, two very appealing child actors.Finally, the creatures deserve a mention since their design is somewhat inventive and interesting. They are just purely animalistic and one can see there would be absolutely no reasoning with monsters of this variety.How did these creatures arise in the first place? Krasinski and company never let you know; they keep exposition to a bare minimum. And that can either be a strength or weakness for the potential viewer.Seven out of 10.",7,2,2,4 October 2018
Ghostbusters," 28 years later, and the flowers are STILL standing!
","The brainchild of co-screenwriter and co-star Dan Aykroyd, 'Ghost Busters' was a pivotal movie in the life of this reviewer, helping to turn him into the movie nut that he became. It's one of the most enduring and endearing contributions to the popular culture of the 1980's, complete with tons of witty lines and its catchy hit title song.The story, for those out there who are newcomers to this classic, deals with three paranormal researchers who find it a blessing in disguise when a university kicks them out. Now they're able to go into business for themselves - the business of trapping and storing all spooks in NYC. We have Bill Murray as 'the mouth', Peter Venkman, Aykroyd as 'the heart', Ray Stantz, co-screenwriter Harold Ramis as 'the brain', Egon Spengler, and Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddmore (gotta love these names), whom they need to hire when the three original guys realize they need an extra man.There are lots of iconic bits and images to continue enjoying - the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, the 'terror dogs', the Ecto-1 vehicle, the opening commotion in the New York Public Library, the final battle with all powerful Gozer, the Ghost Busters' initial gig taking care of pesky green guy Slimer, etc. It was a testament to just how big this movie would break when even in the early going black market T shirts were being sold with sayings from the movie printed on them. The bouncy pop soundtrack is a joy, as is a score by Elmer Bernstein that alternates between horror and humour just as the movie itself does.And 'Ghost Busters' indeed stands tall as a big budget Hollywood example of how a movie can be both scary and funny in equal measure. The cast couldn't be better; Sigourney Weaver is radiant as love interest Dana Barrett, Rick Moranis often hysterical as nerdy neighbour Louis Tully, who riffs like crazy in a priceless speech during a party. William Atherton is just right as snooty nemesis (and foil to Venkman) Walter Peck of the E.P.A. Annie Potts is just a hoot as deadpan receptionist Janine. Lots of other familiar faces in supporting roles and bits, too: David Margulies, Steven Tash, Jennifer Runyon, Michael Ensign, Alice Drummond, Jordan Charney, Timothy Carhart, John Rothman, Reginald VelJohnson, and Jean Kasem, with Roger Grimsby, Larry King, Joe Franklin, and Casey Kasem seen or heard as themselves. There's the occasional dodgy special effect, but mostly the effects are fun to watch.'Ghost Busters', one of the great NYC movies, keeps holding up well on repeat viewings and never loses its appeal.10 out of 10.",10,0,0,27 March 2012
Gran Torino," An excellent latter-day Eastwood vehicle.
","Producer & director & star Clint Eastwood here fashioned a completely disarming fable that showcases him to memorable effect. Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is a retired Ford auto worker who's just lost his beloved wife of many years. He's also a Korean War veteran who's very free with his politically incorrect views, and doesn't particularly care for the Hmong immigrants that have moved into his neighbourhood. All the same, he finds himself driven to look out for the troubled teenager (Bee Vang as Thao) who lives next door. When things get ugly and melodramatic, Walt rationally looks at ways to remove negative influences from Thao's life.'Gran Torino' (the title taking itself from the 1972 vintage automobile that is Walts' prized possession) is compelling every step of the way, with Clint doing extremely well in the colourful lead role. His evolution as a character is central to the story (concocted by Nick Schenk and Dave Johannson), and it's believable and realistic all the way. Walt doesn't just miraculously shed himself of racist views overnight. We can see that he's become something along the lines of a stereotypical Grumpy Old Man, but Clint always makes him a real human being and not a cartoon character. The other characters are also treated respectfully and interestingly, and while the subplot with the Hmong gang may ultimately drive the tale into more conventional melodrama trappings, Clint keeps things rooted with an interest in ruminating on the whole idea of life and death. Walt may have lived the bulk of his life already and have little to lose, but he doesn't want to see his new friend blow it all for the sake of vengeance.The supporting cast is variable, but the earnestness of Vang, and Ahney Her as his sassy sister, does count for something. The gang members are the kind of unrepentant scum who make for absolutely perfect villains. Clint anchors everything with an appealing, nuanced performance that *could* be viewed as an aged variation on Dirty Harry Callahan, but in truth is something deeper and more affecting. He's always been ambitious in terms of performances and projects, and here we get to see him flex typically sharp filmmaking muscle.Not to be missed, for any fan of classic film stars such as Clint.Music composed by Michael Stevens & Clint's son Kyle; another son, Scott, appears on screen as Trey.Eight out of 10.",8,1,1,11 August 2019
Slap Shot," Essential viewing for any hockey fan.
","Paul Newman, once again working with his 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' and 'The Sting' director George Roy Hill, has one of his finest roles here. He's Reggie Dunlop, the fun-loving player / coach of minor league hockey team The Charlestown Chiefs. The outlook for the team is not good; they've been struggling for a while. But after the lively Hanson brothers (bespectacled, goofy Jeff Carlson, Steve Carlson, and David Hanson) join the team, Reggie is inspired, and the team turns their fortunes around by beginning to play dirty.Considered by many to be the greatest hockey film of all time, 'Slap Shot' is not just a must-see for fans of the sport, but also people who love a good comedy and fans of the actors involved. The film does take on a circus-like attitude when the players give in to their more primitive instincts and not only participate in fights, but instigate them. This leads to a lot of great on-ice action, complete with plenty of bone-crunching and face-smashing. Written by Nancy Dowd (whose brother Ned was a technical advisor and plays the much-talked-about character Ogilthorpe), 'Slap Shot' is highlighted by a hilariously profane script that allows the cast to throw out all sorts of obscenities.Adding some gravitas to the story is the 'depressed working class town' atmosphere, in which the potential closing of a local mill could spell all sorts of trouble for the team and the citizens.The actors work together wonderfully: the cheerful Newman, the priceless Strother Martin (Newmans' nemesis in 'Cool Hand Luke') as the weaselly manager / P.R. man for the team, Michael Ontkean (as the goal-scorer who won't get with the program and play rough), Jennifer Warren, Lindsay Crouse, Jerry Houser, Andrew Duncan (very funny as the toupee-wearing local announcer), Yvon Barrette, Allan F. Nicholls, Brad Sullivan, Stephen Mendillo, Matthew Cowles, Kathryn Walker, Melinda Dillon, M. Emmet Walsh, Swoosie Kurtz, Christopher Murney, Paul Dooley.Rough, tough, and rousing, 'Slap Shot' is a sure audience-pleaser. It's a classic sports comedy that loses none of its appeal over 40 years later.Followed by two direct-to-video sequels.Nine out of 10.",9,5,5,6 January 2019
Event Horizon," Creepy at times.
","Right from the beginning, it may be clear that 'Event Horizon' owes a pretty big debt to 'Alien' (but then, so do many other post-1979 films) but it does have a fairly interesting story and it does live up to the word 'horror'. It gets substantially unnerving and creates some wonderfully horrific imagery. In fact, as films of this type go, it's a pleasure in terms of the visuals - special effects, sets, cinematography. Devotees of these genres should find it to be solid if not exceptional entertainment. They may find the 'science' ludicrous, but still be amused.In the year 2047, an exploratory spaceship, the 'Event Horizon' of the title, has reappeared after having been lost for seven years. A U.S.A.C. team is launched to find out what happened, and rescue any possible survivors. They do this in the company of the ships' designer, William Weir (Sam Neill), who has a tragedy in his past, and members of the team bring their own baggage to the situation, with no-nonsense Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) in charge of the mission. What they learn is that the ship now seems to be 'alive', and aware of what has happened in the teams' pasts.The script by Philip Eisner is not without humour, but it mostly plays things straight, and the cast performs it with real gravity. Fishburne is good as a rock-solid type of man, while Neill gets a chance to tear into the scenery as Weir becomes more and more deranged. Kathleen Quinlan is affecting as Peters, who is having to deal with child custody issues in her personal life. Joely Richardson is good as efficient team member Starck, and Richard T. Jones, Jack Noseworthy, Jason Isaacs, and Sean Pertwee round out the cast.Things get off to a nice start with Paramount putting a fun spin on their standard logo sequence, and director Paul Anderson guides everything with style.'Event Horizon' may be derivative in some ways, but it moves along well and is never dull.Seven out of 10.",7,1,2,14 September 2013
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Solid entertainment for older children and adults.
","Pumpkin King Jack Skellington (voiced by Chris Sarandon) is a big guy in his home land of Halloween Town. One day, during his travels, he comes upon a series of trees with doors that transport the individual to various holiday worlds. Jack enters Christmas Town and loves what he sees; he's enchanted. Therefore, when he returns to Halloween Town, he implores his fellow citizens to come up with their own version of Christmas. As one is likely to imagine, he doesn't quite 'get it', at least when it comes to his idea of good gifts. To add to the situation, Santa Claus (who Jack and others think is named Sandy Claws) is abducted, and when Jack fills his place, chaos erupts.Producer Tim Burtons' imagination is in full bloom here, and is vividly realized by director Henry Selick. The animation is slick and gorgeous. There are a wealth of stylish visuals, both in Halloween Town and Christmas Town. The characters and their designs are delightful, from Jack to Sally (voice of Catherine O'Hara) to the evil scientist (voice of William Hickey) to the fiendish Oogie Boogie (voice of Ken Page). Caroline Thompson ('Edward Scissorhands', 'Corpse Bride'), wrote the screenplay, with Michael McDowell ('Beetlejuice', 'Tales from the Darkside: The Movie)' credited with the adaptation. Another frequent Burton collaborator, Danny Elfman, supplies the many catchy songs (this viewers' favourites are 'What's This' and 'Oogie Boogie's Song') and also performs the lovely singing voice of Jack. The eclectic cast also includes Glenn Shadix (who voices the mayor) and Paul 'Pee-wee Herman' Reubens (who voices Lock).Some younger children may not take to a lot of the more freakish designs and characters, but otherwise this is fine family viewing, with a fairly trim story and running time (77 minutes all told).One point of interest for people may be deciding whether to watch this during the Halloween season, the Christmas season, or both, for that matter.Eight out of 10.",8,0,0,3 December 2014
Evil Dead," 'This time, the only @#$%ing way is the hard way!'
","Over 30 years after the original 'The Evil Dead' first started to earn its place in horror cinema, co-writer / director Fede Alvarez and company brought this reimagining to the big screen. While it's safe to say that their hearts were in the right place, this 21st century version just does not have the impact of the original.The story is somewhat similar to the one concocted by Sam Raimi back in the early 1980s. A quintet of none-too-bright young people gather at a remote family cabin deep in the woods. The variation on the story this time around is that four of the kids are concerned about their friend Mia (Jane Levy), a habitual junkie, and are doing everything that they can to help her. But when the characters discover the type of ancient artifacts in horror movies that we know people shouldn't mess with, one of them, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) reads through the book, not realizing what he's doing. The demons in the woods are then free to possess these hapless schmucks.While Raimis' film was played straight (and commendably so) by its cast, it had a decidedly more playful edge to it. It wasn't about wallowing in unpleasantness so much as it was just about having some fun. This version is far more glum, and almost humourless. Some horror fans may appreciate a genre film that lives up to the word 'horror', but it's simply a little too hard to care much about these characters. When they buy the farm in glorious, savage ways, one cheers basically because they're tired of spending time with these people.'The Evil Dead' '13 pays homage to the original in certain ways: the 'Force' P.o.V., the damned Book of the Dead, the necklace, the vegetation that comes to life, etc. But Alvarez and company don't come up with anything truly interesting of their own that they can add to this formula. But at least horror lovers who measure a films' success depending on the amount of its gore will be VERY happy here; once this flick gets going, it's just a non-stop onslaught of violence and sadism.The cast isn't as memorable, for sure. Shiloh Fernandez is not too bad an actor, but he just doesn't have the charisma of B movie icon Bruce Campbell. Levy gives it her all as the victimized Mia. Pucci is saddled with the task of providing all the exposition that he can derive from the Book.For the faithful, and those who are willing to sit through the end credits, will be rewarded with a cameo by a familiar face.Six out of 10.",6,1,4,3 August 2013
The Evil Dead," Join us!
","One could easily describe this landmark horror film as The Little Horror Film That Could. Made for a meager $375,000 by a troupe of Detroit buddies in the woods of Tennessee, it still stands tall three decades after its release. Led by writer / director Sam Raimi, the crew set out to take the films' viewers on a hell of a ride, one that gleefully gets in ones' face and delights in over the top carnage and mayhem. Fast, fresh, and frequently funny, its old school practical effects (including stop motion animation) remain a treat to watch; the film may indeed be a little 'rough around the edges', but that merely adds to its charm.The story has five young chums - two guys, three gals - travelling to a cabin in the mountains who have their fun interrupted when by poking around some artifacts left by the cabins' previous tenant, they unleash the demons that had been dozing in the area. Once the demons start possessing this hapless quintet, it becomes clear that there's going to be plenty of bodily dismemberment going on.Raimi and company aren't afraid to dispense with good taste here, as witness the notorious scene with a lecherous tree limb. The atmosphere is completely authentic and the performances totally committed. Bruce Campbell may be the breakout star of the production, as poor, tortured Ash, but everybody here delivers an entertaining performance. 'The Evil Dead' shows some real imagination and ingenuity, and takes only the barest of breathers in between its assaults on your senses.The film has a healthy respect for horror films of the past, and as an appreciable in joke, features a ripped up poster of Wes Cravens' 'The Hills Have Eyes' in the cabins' basement. It's films like this that prove that old adage that the independent productions are great for forcing their makers to be creative, and everybody involved gets an A for effort (buffs will note that Raimis' friend Joel Coen was the assistant editor here), from composer Joseph LoDuca to cinematographer Tim Philo to makeup effects creator Tom Sullivan.This remains great fun from viewing to viewing, and its two sequels kept up the tradition of imbuing the horror genre with a riotous sense of humour. A true crowd pleaser.Eight out of 10.",8,1,5,31 July 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Escapism of the highest order.
","Described by writer / director Quentin Tarantino as 'a 'duck press' of the grindhouse cinema he'd absorbed over 35 years of his life', 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' serves as an exhilarating, wild, genuinely visionary epic tale of a character concocted by himself and Uma Thurman. Uma plays 'The Bride' (whenever her real name is uttered, it's bleeped out, to help accentuate her 'Man with No Name' quality). The Bride had tried to quit the organization for which she worked, and get married, but boss & lover Bill (David Carradine) sent his lethal international hit squad to eliminate her and everybody at her wedding party. We follow this character as she determinedly hunts down each and every person who did her wrong, and dishes out some thoroughly enjoyable revenge. Tarantino funnels the various martial arts pictures, spaghetti Westerns, and anime that he's admired into one distinct and potent stew, made in a great comic book style, executed with panache and divided into various chapters in a 'Pulp Fiction' manner, moving back and forth in time, and the pieces are never, ever hard to put together. This is fun and exciting story telling that never shies away from the red stuff, with KNB delivering splatter so unabashedly over the top that it's endlessly amusing. Tarantino's use of soundtrack music is extremely eclectic; what original music there is, is composed by The RZA, but tracks from a rich variety of composers & artists - Bernard Herrmann, Charles Bernstein, Frank Mills, Quincy Jones, Isaac Hayes, Luis Bacalov, Zamfir, Tomoyasu Hotei, Riz Ortolani,and Ennio Morricone make for an excellent listen and a soaring accompaniment to the action, which culminates in a breathless, amazing job of swordplay as The Bride takes on scores of henchmen. The cast is just a pleasure to watch, with Uma an utter delight; it's also fun to see Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Liu as her intended victims. In fact, the whole cast, also featuring Julie Dreyfus, Michael Parks (once again playing Earl McGraw), Chiaki Kuriyama of 'Battle Royale' fame, and Michael Bowen as sleazy creep Buck (as in 'I'm Buck, and I'm here to...') is a blast. Michael Madsen briefly sets up his role for Volume 2, and Carradine is only present as a voice at this point; Tarantino having originally envisioned this as one long movie that got broken up into two parts for theatrical release. It's a particular treat to see martial arts legend Shinichi 'Sonny' Chiba as the old sword maker who takes a liking to The Bride and is sympathetic to her mission. Even at an hour and 51 minutes, the pacing here never flags, and the movie is just plain fun, with a delightful contribution by musical act The 5, 6, 7, 8's who perform covers as well as their own songs. Right from beginning to end, 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' kicks a whole lot of ass. Nine out of 10.",9,6,12,17 February 2012
Clash of the Titans," Mildly amusing at best.
","This modern day remake of the 1981 fantasy favorite is at least somewhat faithful to its storyline. It spins a yarn based on Greek mythology, when mankind is sick and tired of the tyranny of gods such as all-powerful Zeus (who else but Liam Neeson). Perseus (stone faced Aussie hunk Sam Worthington) is the young hero of the piece, sired by Zeus with a mortal woman. Perseus actually has no desire to live the life of a god, but finds himself drawn into a quest. He and others will journey to the land of the Stygian witches to learn how the monstrous Kraken can possibly be destroyed. At stake is the land of Argos.From the beginning, it appeared to this viewer that the main reason this movie existed was to swap the charming stop motion animation of legendary special effects man Ray Harryhausen for cutting edge CGI. It's more of a grandiose technical achievement than a story well told, really. Director Louis Leterrier rarely gives us a chance to breathe. Granted, some of the action set pieces are intense, but they also tend to be incoherent at times. The digital effects are variable: the scorpions are pretty cool, but the Kraken, quite frankly, is a washout despite the attempts to convey its immense size. The venture into Medusas' lair should have been a better set piece, but she doesn't come off all that well either. And it's much too bad that Pegasus (referred to here as 'the' Pegasus) has such a small role to play. The taming of this winged horse was a much more substantial sequence in the original movie. Impressive location shooting (in such places as Ethiopia and the Canary Islands) and thunderous music by Ramin Djawadi can't do a lot to make this version stand out in any way.Like the visual effects, acting is variable from the usually excellent international cast. 'Clash of the Titans' 2010 can boast such players as Jason Flemyng, Alexa Davalos, Mads Mikkelsen, Izabella Miko, Liam Cunningham, Nicholas Hoult, Polly Walker, Pete Postlethwaite, Elizabeth McGovern, Alexander Siddig, and Danny Huston. Most of the cast isn't given that much to work with, but the beautiful Gemma Arterton, and a heavily made up Ralph Fiennes, offer standout performances. She plays the wise guiding spirit in Perseus' life, while he plays the vengeful antagonist of the piece: Hades, dark lord of the underworld.Overall, this is passable entertainment, but it's also awfully forgettable.Look for a cameo from one of the Harryhausen creations of 1981.Six out of 10.",6,0,0,30 August 2017
Jurassic World," Dino might!
","It's been quite some time since the initial disaster on Isla Nublar, and the late John Hammonds' dream of a fully functioning dinosaur theme park has finally come to fruition. Thousands flock to an island paradise where they see the mighty lizards put on display. Naturally, since this is meant to be a thrill ride, colossal human error will dictate that our ferocious antagonists get loose and wreak havoc on park visitors and personnel. Chief among them is a genetic freak called an 'Indominus Rex', created because at this point people supposedly consider ordinary dinosaurs passe.One has to put up with some ridiculous, insipid characters and lame dialogue in this, the most recent entry in this ongoing franchise, but if all you want is to see big lizards run about and attack and eat people, you'll get it. Director Colin Trevorrow, with the assistance of such talents as production designer Ed Verreaux, cinematographer John Schwartzman, and editor Kevin Stitt, is able to create lots of brainless thrills. And make no mistake, it is pretty brainless. There are the standard absurdities to tolerate on the way to enjoying 'Jurassic World'. The main ones would be these human characters. This viewer certainly wouldn't have minded seeing most of them, if not all of them, become dinosaur chow. Surviving with his dignity intact is studly Chris Pratt, as a guy who's actually succeeded in training raptors. Forced to play a real archetype is Vincent D'Onofrio as a schemer who believes the 'Indominus Rex' and the raptors would make excellent military weapons.The dinos, of course, are the *real* stars of this show. The visual effects are generally pretty good, and we see menaces that also include an enormous swimming mosasaur and numerous pterodactyls. Things get a little too precious, however, when we consider the bond that Pratt has developed with his raptor friends.The finale pulls out all the stops for any lover of dinosaur cinema, so things do end on a reasonably high note.Seven out of 10.",7,1,2,9 January 2017
Paranormal Activity," A fairly effective movie for this genre.
","'Paranormal Activity' is one of those polarizing movies that, for the most part, will simply either work for the viewer or not. While scanning the most popular reviews, one can see comments ranging from quite positive to quite negative. In any event, it certainly developed a winning formula for success, having been filmed on a VERY low budget and generating huge revenue, proving that big budgets aren't necessary to create a box office sensation. It takes no name actors and puts them in a 'found footage' scenario as a boyfriend (Micah Sloat) stubbornly insists on documenting just about everything when he and his girlfriend (Katie Featherston) start experiencing strange phenomena in their large and opulent San Diego home. As can be expected, things start out small and become creepier as time goes on. Eventually, things end with a big bang. Director Oren Peli manages to create a good atmosphere for the many night time scenes, and some genuine shocks, and does all of this with a noticeable lack of special effects. Our two leads are able to consult with a psychic (Mark Fredrichs), who gives them some valuable knowledge, but he's still not exactly an expert in matters deemed to be demonic in nature, so there is little that they can do to protect or arm themselves. The very minimal level of performers also helps to achieve a level of intimacy, and the movie never leaves the one location of the house. Understandably, it's kind of hard to sympathize with the somewhat annoying Micah, who keeps up a pretty cavalier attitude towards the whole thing, and he's one of those characters in these types of movies who keeps the camera going even when implored by another to stop. Katie is definitely a more universally appealing character, but she does bring some baggage to the relationship and scenario, as strange things have been happening to her for much of her life. Ultimately, this viewer gives this moderately positive feedback because, while it never gripped him the way it did so many others, it still managed to come up with some good and eerie moments, and does a fine job of giving off that whole vibe of a house in the early hours of the A.M.

Logan," 'Language, Logan. And you're screaming at a machine.'
","'Logan' turns out to be quite the interesting and satisfying closer on the saga of the Wolverine character. Wolverine, a.k.a. Logan (Hugh Jackman, giving a powerful performance), is now a very weary old mutant in the future year of 2029. Mutants are now all but extinct, yet he soldiers on, basically so he can care for the ailing Professor Xavier (a wonderful Patrick Stewart), who's suffering from Alzheimer's. Into Logan's life comes a mute little girl (debuting Dafne Keen) who's on the run from some very bad guys, including a smiling henchman (Boyd Holbrook) and a maniacal mad scientist (Richard E. Grant). He has just days to transport her to safety (with Professor X in tow), to a supposed 'Eden'.Although not necessarily a big fan of comic book adaptations and superhero movies, this viewer was drawn to 'Logan' due to what amounts to a very mature - and sombre - nature. This is a film that definitely earns its R rating (so parents be warned), with plenty of F-bombs and lots of hard-edged (albeit digitally rendered) violence. At its core is the struggle of its haunted main character to deal with this bleak existence, and what he believes to be the ultimate solution. Jackman is utterly compelling as Logan, making the most of the material as well as embracing the physicality of his role. Stewart provides additional heart and resonance; he and Jackman give emotional weight to the proceedings to add to the expected visceral thrills. Young Keen does a good job as the childish mutant (revealing her abilities in an explosive manner), remaining mute until well into the story. Holbrook and Grant are superb as unsubtle villains whom the audience will enjoy booing. Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal, and Quincy Fouse are appealing as a rural family whose fate is sealed when they make the acquaintance of Logan and company.James Mangold does a solid job with the direction, also authoring the story and co-writing the screenplay. One of his most interesting touches is to heavily reference the legendary Western 'Shane'.Although a very long film at two hours and 18 minutes, Mangold wastes no time, making every second count and contrasting the colourful life of the X-Men in the comics with the cold, hard reality facing our characters in this tale.Eight out of 10.",8,0,0,4 December 2019
Annie Hall," Woody Allen's fresh, intelligent, and innovative romantic comedy.
","With this film Allen had successfully made the transition from comedian to full blown auteur, and here he employs a variety of techniques and gimmicks - even animation - to create an unconventional way of looking at human relationships, and the neuroses that can ultimately damage them. It's very much his distinct voice, as he offers many musings on many topics, not just how people relate to each other, but the whole idea of N.Y.C. vs. L.A. He offers some juicy roles to a variety of familiar faces, and the actors make strong impressions no matter how brief their screen time might be. Certainly he gave the role of a lifetime to the endearing Diane Keaton, who firmly establishes a quirky and lovely screen persona.Allen plays Alvy Singer, a successful comedian who, through his friend Rob (Tony Roberts), makes the acquaintance of nightclub singer and aspiring actress Annie Hall (Ms. Keaton). The film charts the evolution of their romance and the various events that transpire to drive wedges between the two of them.In the meantime, there are some absolutely brilliant moments, especially as Allen plays with the conventions of movie-making, sometimes falling back on that old tradition of acknowledging the audience and really *involving* them. Particularly witty are the way Annie 'removes' herself from a bout of lovemaking, the cameo by Marshall McLuhan, the flashbacks, flash forwards, subtitles to indicate the characters' internal monologues, and split screen. It's then no wonder that fans consider this to be the actor / filmmakers' finest film.Of course, it's also fun to play 'spot the familiar face' with this large cast; the cast also includes Carol Kane, Paul Simon, Shelley Duvall, Janet Margolin, Colleen Dewhurst, and Christopher Walken, and in featured roles and bits the likes of John Glover, John Dennis Johnston, Laurie Bird, Jeff 'I forgot my mantra' Goldblum, Shelley Hack, Beverly D'Angelo, Tracey Walter, and in a long shot near the end, Sigourney Weaver in her film debut.One will notice that there's no music score, but you'll hardly miss having one: the comedy and drama work well enough on their own without any sort of accompaniment.Eight out of 10.",8,1,2,12 January 2014
2001: A Space Odyssey," I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.
","A half-century later, '2001: A Space Odyssey' remains a remarkable achievement for its visionary producer / director Stanley Kubrick, who wrote the screenplay with noted author Arthur C. Clarke. Its visuals were state-of-the-art at the time, and they are still impressive all these years later. It depicts the contact that mankind has with aliens over thousands of years, beginning in the 'Dawn of Man' when various ape-men puzzle over a strange new artifact in their world. It then makes a hard cut to the early 21st century, when space has been colonized and something amazing has been discovered beneath the surface of the moon. Then, we jump ahead again to a mission to Jupiter, commandeered by astronauts Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). They will have their hands full, dealing with a problematic artificial intelligence named HAL (voiced by an eerily calm Douglas Rain), after which Dave is taken on a truly startling final journey.It's breathtaking to see the results of an obviously huge amount of work. Due to its widescreen photography (by Geoffrey Unsworth and John Alcott) and its sound design, this is one picture that would really rock on a big screen. Kubrick is quite daring in his approach, crafting a film that moves so slowly that it could bore people with short attention spans. But this does help in portraying a certain monotonous and empty feeling when people are working in deep space. Other elements lending '2001' distinction are Kubricks' use of many classic compositions, from the 'Blue Danube' to (most memorably) 'Also Sprach Zarathustra'. The script by Kubrick and Clarke offers a stately, intelligent approach to the idea of working in outer space, complete with colourful but rather antiseptic environments. Described by some as basically a tale about evolution, and the role that these extraterrestrials played in it, it offers no easy, clear-cut answers, but instead leaves details (including the ending) open to discussion, which has kept viewers pondering it for decades. Provocative stories like this, that fire our imaginations and intellects, are often the ones with true staying power.The performances (the cast also includes William Sylvester, Daniel Richter, Leonard Rossiter, Margaret Tyzack, Robert Beatty, and Sean Sullivan) do not blow a viewer away, but are perfectly low key and do suit the material. Rain deserves a lot of credit for creating a legendary 'villain' through just the sheer relaxed tone of his voice.Sadly, this is NOT going to suit all tastes, but audiences who favour sci-fi pictures that stress the 'science' aspect, and attempt to appeal to adult intellects, will find it richly rewarding, no matter the run time.Originally screened at two hours and 41 minutes; later cut by about 19 minutes. The version on the Blu-ray runs two hours and 29 minutes, complete with an overture, intermission, and exit music.This delivers the kind of movie experience that discerning viewers don't easily forget.10 out of 10.",10,3,5,17 September 2018
Taken," The lesson for today is don't mess with Liam Neeson.
","The film star is all kinds of bad ass in this grim, intense action flick, which could be described as a very lean and very mean James Bond type of film. It's so briskly paced and action packed that it clocks in at a very trim 91 minutes (and it only runs an extra two minutes in the unrated extended cut). If it does its job, you won't be thinking about how implausible any of it might be - you'll just be wolfing down the popcorn and having a high old time.Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a retired CIA operative who's left the business to make up for lost time with his now teen aged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). She gets an opportunity to travel to Europe, and the protective, cautious dad is dubious about the whole thing, especially upon learning of the lack of parental figures on this trip. Of course, he's proved right as the hapless girl is abducted by Albanian human traffickers. He gets his ass to Paris and leaves a trail of death and destruction in his wake as he does everything he has to do to save his girl.As long as one is looking for some undemanding no-brainer violent fun, they can quite enjoy 'Taken'. It definitely doesn't waste its time once its gets going. It is a little slow to start as it establishes Bryan trying to be a cool dad and making a living performing such duties as security for a pop star (Holly Valance). But when Bryan gets moving, the movie turns into a wild ride, with plentiful scummy bad guys who can't die soon enough. It's also amusing to note how ruthless Bryan can be. The man doesn't care who he has to shoot in order to get what he wants. Some viewers may find the activities of the bad guys to be quite off putting, especially considering the fact that they place a high value on virgins. Editing, location work, and photography are all well done, and a good supporting cast including some familiar faces (Leland Orser, Jon Gries, Xander Berkeley, and the lovely as ever Famke Janssen as Bryans' ex- wife) all help to make this agreeable escapism.As far as this kind of entertainment goes, one could certainly do a lot worse.Seven out of 10.",7,1,1,15 June 2013
This Is Spinal Tap," Incredibly funny: a true comedy classic.
","Comedic actors Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer show off their fantastic ability to improvise in this dead on parody of rock documentaries. Rob Reiner, making his feature film directing debut, and who co-wrote the script with the stars, plays a documentary filmmaker who decides to chronicle the latest tour of a veteran rock group that has clearly seen much better days.The movie features a very high amount of gags that actually work, and one can believe that, yeah, crazy stuff like this could very well happen in the world of rock 'n' roll. Among the best are the conceptual drawings of the band ('This is what you'd look like as a crab.'), the recreation of a piece of Stonehenge that is nowhere near as large as the band wanted, the amplifier that goes to 11, Nigels' description of a heart warming piece he's composed, and a truly gut busting sequence wherein the cover art for the bands' latest album is discussed.The three main actors are all wonderful and show a real talent for, and knowledge of, music as well as comedy, which really helps to create a level of believability. Some of their dialogue is truly hilarious. There's a lot of familiar faces in the supporting cast; the cameos are a delight.As a bonus, the music is really pretty good, and are accompanied by some of the silliest / most brilliant lyrics you'll ever hear.At 83 minutes in length, this doesn't go on any longer than it has to, and it maintains a superb forward momentum the entire time, coming up with one great laugh after another and remaining fresh and unpredictable.Highly recommended.Eight out of 11.",8,2,5,3 March 2013
Toy Story 2," Great fun for fans of the first film.
","The makers of 'Toy Story', which made history as the first family film entirely animated by computer, actually manage to outdo themselves here. This sequel packs a lot of energy and adventure, as well as some real poignancy, into its trim 93 minute run time. Better yet, it's quite interesting and thoughtful in the way it portrays the relationship of toys to their owners. Yes, all of us do grow up and, to an extent, outgrow our childhood playthings, but when we are young, our toys can mean a lot to us. And 'Toy Story 2' memorably illustrates the idea that any toy has worth if it it utilized, and loved, by a child. It is ultimately this lack of self-worth that drives a certain character in their mission.Woody (Tom Hanks, in fine form) ventures outside to save a wheezy squeaky-toy penguin (Joe Ranft) from falling victim to a yard sale. Unfortunately, an unscrupulous, ambitious collector (Wayne Knight) sees Woody, recognizes him for his worth, and steals him. You see, once upon a time, the character was a TV phenomenon, spawning all sorts of merchandising. In the collectors' apartment, Woody meets the other characters from the show - Bullseye the horse, Stinky Pete the prospector (Kelsey Grammer), and 'yodelling cowgirl' Jessie (Joan Cusack), who awaken him to his history. And Woody soon finds this enticing. Meanwhile, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and several of Woody's fellow toys embark on an often perilous mission to get Woody back.There's so much action in this that it could actually rival a typical live-action treatment of such material. Family members will enjoy the thrills - as well as the abundant sentiment, and the many genuinely funny moments. New characters such as Jessie and Bullseye are quite endearing, and some of the old favourites are as hysterical as ever. Wallace Shawn is particularly hysterical as toy dinosaur 'Rex', and there's a brief gag referencing 'Jurassic Park' that made this viewer laugh out loud. One could argue that it's all a little TOO much, with the screenwriters, directors, and company throwing one big roadblock after another into the path of our heroes.One clever touch is to revisit the idea of a toy that has no idea that they are, in fact, a toy, and takes themselves much too seriously. This happens when Buzz encounters another of his brand, and the other Buzz keeps making things difficult. Al the collector is just a perfect opportunist slime ball, and Buzz' nemesis Zurg is a hoot (there's an unexpected reference to a legendary moment in The Empire Strikes Back along the way).You sure can't argue with success: this formula of Pixars' has worked much more often than not.Eight out of 10.",8,0,1,23 August 2018
Drag Me to Hell," Obviously a very divisive film.
","Veteran filmmaker Sam Raimi made his much-ballyhooed return to the horror genre with this crazed picture, after years of working on mainstream titles such as 'A Simple Plan', 'For Love of the Game', and the first three 'Spider-Man' feature films. Alison Lohman stars as Christine Brown, loan officer at a bank. She covets a possible promotion a little too much, and her boss (David Paymer) likes people who are able to make tough decisions. Therefore, she denies an extension to the loan to elderly Gypsy Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver). This, of course, is a fatal mistake. The old lady becomes livid and curses Christine. Now a demon dubbed the Lamia will be on its way to drag Christine to Hell in three days time. Christine, who suffers one garish episode after another, works every angle she can think of to avoid the inevitable.Many reviews here at IMDb tend to go to one extreme or the other: people either love it or loathe it. There aren't that many middle-of-the-road assessments. That said, this viewer did have some genuine fun with this over the top story and film, although it's not without its flaws. Raimi goes for 'GOTCHA!' jump scares a little too often, there's an onslaught of utterly cheesy digital effects, and there are moments that are much more laughable than shocking. It is commendable that Raimi and his cast & crew give the proceedings a lot of energy, and fans of the first two 'Evil Dead' features may take *some* delight in the way that Raimi goes for the gross-out so often. He never seems to run out of things to stick in Lohmans' mouth. One unqualified highlight is the grandiose music score by Christopher Young, giving the whole thing an operatic feel.All of this would be rather meaningless if the lead character weren't at least somewhat sympathetic, and Lohman makes Christine an appealing character. Justin Long is similarly engaging as her loving, faithful boyfriend, and the top supporting cast also showcases talents such as Raver (who's memorably creepy and disgusting), Dileep Rao (as a fortune teller), Adriana Barraza (as a medium who'd encountered the Lamia 40 years ago), the always solid Paymer, and Chelcie Ross as Longs' father. Raimis' actor brother Ted can be heard briefly as a doctor making a house call; Octavia Spencer has a small role as a bank employee.This comes complete with a 'twist' near the end that isn't too hard to predict.Overall, decent entertainment. It may be silly at times, but at least it isn't boring.Seven out of 10.",7,13,14,14 March 2018
Mama," Flawed but compelling.
","Guillermo del Toro presents and executive produces this decent psychological horror film, expanded from a three minute short by its co-writer / director Andres Muschietti. Muschietti manages to create a somber and creepy mood throughout. He's crafted a fairly touching story, and he gets very fine performances out of both his adult and child actors. The atmosphere is excellent at times, but what really works against his efforts is the overload of visual effects. They really help to kill the mystery. Also, some genre fans are likely to be less than pleased with Muschietti opting to go for the jump scare as often as he does. The result is a mildly entertaining horror film that falls short of its full potential.The versatile Jessica Chastain is solid as a rocker chick named Annabel - she plays bass - who's involved with Lucas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). Lucas is uncle to two adorable little girls, who were taken into the wilderness by their unhinged father (also played by Coaster-Waldau). Dad has already committed a few murders and looks like he will add his daughters to the list before *something* snatches him. Five years later, the girls are finally found, and having lived in the country for so long, have become quite feral. With the help of a dedicated psychiatrist, Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash), they become somewhat readjusted to normal life. However, Annabel becomes convinced that some sort of presence has returned with the girls, who claim to have been acquainted with a character whom they merely dub Mama.Some viewers feel that for whatever Muschietti is able to accomplish, he blows it with that finale, which admittedly disregards anything resembling subtlety. Still, there is an emotional centre to this film that makes it hard to completely dislike. The director really goes for broke with his imagery, using moths as a motif. Coaster-Waldau is likable as the uncle, who does some sleuthing, as does the good doctor. (It is nice to see Kash, who played Spunkmeyer in 'Aliens' 28 years ago, in a major supporting such as this.) Megan Charpentier as Victoria and Isabelle Nelisse as Lilly are both appealing in the child roles.'Mama' isn't exempt from trappings of the genre film, such as questionable character decisions, but all in all it's a reasonably affecting experience.Six out of 10.",6,1,2,16 October 2014
Super 8," It definitely has some charm going for it.
","'Super 8' is a surprisingly engaging, heartfelt ode to vintage Steven Spielberg (think 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind') by writer / director J.J. Abrams. It focuses on a tight-knit group of young friends in the summer of 1979. Right now, led by their director, Charles (Riley Griffiths), they're busy making their own shot-on-Super-8 zombie epic. VERY early one morning, they're at the local train station filming scenes when they manage to record a catastrophic train crash. Not only there is much destruction, but a stealthy *something* escapes from the ruined train and vanishes into the night. Soon, the military shows up to try to contain the entity and keep a lid on the matter.It's true that the final half hour can't measure up to the opening 80 minutes, for then the movie does descend into maudlin predictability. Yes, some people could complain that it turns into an outright 'cheese fest'. But this movie has real heart, and takes place in a rural location (in and around the town of Lillian, Ohio) that could have easily been a setting for a Spielberg film. The production has a respectable amount of razzle-dazzle and an abundance of digital effects, not to mention a fairly well conceived alien creature. It has a body count of sorts, so it won't be completely harmless for the youngest of viewers. It also takes a pretty dim view of the military, as has been the case for scores of genre pictures for approximately half a century. A first rate filmmaking team includes cinematographer Larry Fong and production designer Martin Whist; the music by Michael Giacchino perfectly sets the mood.The cast couldn't be more likeable, even if some of the characters are formula types. In fact, it's the camaraderie among the kids that really makes this work as well as it does. Joel Courtney as Joe is our main character, a boy mourning the violent death of his mother, and at odds with his policeman father (Kyle Chandler). Ryan Lees' Cary is one of those expected 'quirky' type of roles, a kid who likes to blow stuff up real good. Elle Fanning is appealing as the leading lady of the movie-within-the-movie, upon whom Joe crushes. Familiar faces in supporting parts and bits include Ron Eldard (as Fannings' troubled pop), Glynn Turman (as a science teacher who sets the story in motion), Noah Emmerich (as a hard-charging Air Force colonel), Bruce Greenwood, Dale Dickey, Richard T. Jones, and Dan Castellaneta.Overall, it may be imperfect - with the expected sob-into-your-hankie character resolutions and out-of-this-world finale - but it did hit a nerve with this viewer, who expects that some Spielberg devotees will go right for it.Eight out of 10.",8,2,4,4 March 2018
Sinister," I can't say I loved this one as much as some people.
","'Sinister' represents a good, sincere effort in the overworked genre known as 'found footage'. It's generally well acted, with the cast managing to create some watchable enough characters. Co-writer / director Scott Derrickson ('Deliver Us from Evil', 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose') is able to craft some suspense, atmosphere, and overall creepiness. That said, the whole thing reeks of familiarity, too much of it for it to work that well, and in the end it's pretty damn predictable.Ethan Hawke stars as Ellison Oswalt, a struggling true crime author desperate to recapture the success of an earlier book. So he makes the standard Dumb Horror Movie Choice of moving with his wife and kids into a forbidding setting: the home of a family who was hung in their backyard. When he ventures into the attic, he finds scores of Super 8 film left behind - all of it featuring murder and much of it featuring an ominous presence.Hawke does alright, and has some good moments with Juliet Rylance as the long suffering wife Tracy, Fred Dalton Thompson as the disapproving sheriff, and James Ransone as the young deputy who's eager to be of service to the author, in hopes of receiving a shout out in Ellisons' current book. Clare Foley and Michael Hall D'Addario are decent as the kids, who each pick up on the bad vibes in the house and express their feelings in similar ways. Vincent D'Onofrio has a key uncredited role as an exposition provider.Basically, this is very slickly made, with top notch cinematography by Chris Norr, and it is somewhat spooky at times, but it doesn't bring that much to the table, and is prone to too many jump scares and 'stinger' moments in the music score.Six out of 10.",6,1,2,5 September 2014
Where Eagles Dare," Shows its audience a great time.
","'Where Eagles Dare' is an invigorating wartime (in this case WWII) action-espionage-thriller, extremely well directed (by Brian G. Hutton) and engagingly acted. It's very long, but very absorbing. Even at two hours and 36 minutes, it's never boring. The story, as concocted by Alistair MacLean, has got some delicious twists going for it, and it holds your attention from beginning to end. The characters are fun to watch, heroes and villains alike. And there's a fair bit of violence and TONS of explosions to add to its energy level.The set-up is intriguing. A military operation is underway as a team of British commandos (with American Ranger Schaffer (Clint Eastwood) along for the ride) attempt to infiltrate a Nazi stronghold which is high in the mountains. Their mission is to liberate an American general (Robert Beatty) who's been taken prisoner. At least, that would SEEM to be the case...Richard Burton is excellent in the lead role of the unflappable leader of the mission, Major Smith. As things go on, he's required to give a performance within the performance, so to speak, and does a commanding job. Eastwoods' role is to largely react to what's going on around him. His consternation is understandable. The rest of the cast does equally praiseworthy work: lovely ladies Mary Ure and Ingrid Pitt, Patrick Wymark, Michael Hordern, Donald Houston, Anton Diffring, Ferdy Mayne, and Derren Nesbitt.Thanks to the capable second unit direction by Yakima Canutt, the action is first rate and the film really does leave you breathless at times. There are some absolutely convincing and hair-raising set pieces, especially on the sky trams going up and down the mountain. And even when a team of characters is making their escape, it's expectedly no easy task, and the enemy keeps the pressure on constantly. Finally, MacLeans' script has one last wonderful twist to sneak in before things are brought to a close.Accompanied by majestic music composed by Ron Goodwin, this really is top notch screen entertainment.Nine out of 10. .",9,1,4,17 September 2014
From Hell," Well done, if not too memorable.
","'From Hell' is very grim and ultra stylish filmmaking, most impressive for the way it depicts late 19th century London. It's a bleak image of Hell on Earth, an environment in which a maniac dubbed Jack the Ripper is able to flourish. Bloody Jack is carving up prostitutes in horrific fashion, and the weary inspector Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp) is on the case. A haunted individual who uses drugs and experiences psychic visions, Abberline develops an attraction to Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), one of the Whitechapel whores whom he encounters. He soon discovers that there are secrets that important people want to keep secret, and that Jacks' motive might be more complex than he believes.Depp delivers a particularly solid, if somewhat eccentric, performance as Abberline, and receives excellent support from a mostly British cast. Graham manages to be somewhat convincing and not stick out too much. Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson, Jason Flemyng, Katrin Cartlidge, Terence Harvey, Susan Lynch, Paul Rhys, and Lesley Sharp co-star. Holm and Flemyng have particularly interesting roles. The story, adapted by Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias from the graphic novel by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell, is intricately plotted and involving, and it keeps the viewer guessing and on their toes, wondering who will be revealed as the Ripper and it may even catch them off guard when the end does come. Technically, the film is a marvel, with top notch direction by Allen and Albert Hughes, and eye catching production design (by Martin Childs) and cinematography (by Peter Deming). The period recreation is strong, with location filming done in the Czech Republic. There's also a wonderfully ominous score composed by Trevor Jones.The film doesn't really trend on unfamiliar ground, at least not to 'Ripperphiles', but it's quite good and entertaining, and a worthy viewing for horror fans.Eight out of 10.",8,1,1,16 October 2013
Groundhog Day," Complex, endearing movie; more than just 'high concept' comedy.
","Only with the passage of time and an increased sense of awareness can I now see a remarkable movie like 'Groundhog Day' for what it is. The last time I watched it, and that was some time ago, I mostly saw an engaging comedy / drama / fantasy with moments both funny and sobering. Now, I can look at it and see what a thoughtful piece of work it is. It is true that it's the kind of movie that really does benefit from repeat viewings.Bill Murray makes the most of a weighty role as Phil Connors, egocentric, wise ass weatherman who travels to the Pennsylvania community of Punsxutawney to cover its annual Groundhog Day ceremony. A blizzard confines him to the town - a blizzard he failed to predict accurately - and while there he realizes he's trapped in a time loop; Groundhog Day repeats itself over and over, to the point where Phil becomes aware of practically every event that will occur. By turns, Phil is both ecstatic - if there's no tomorrow, he doesn't have to worry about the consequences of his actions, and he engages in some great comic bits of recklessness - and despondent, when his attempts to use his knowledge for self gain go awry. Only after some efforts to come to grips with the course of events does he realize the power of any human being's thoughts and actions, as he has the ability to be there for other people and even save their lives.Murray is great, whether he's being introspective, rascally / charming, or saddened. Andie MacDowell provides an appealing love interest as Rita, the terminally chipper producer to whom he realizes he's becoming attracted. A supporting cast of familiar faces also helps: Chris Elliott as the cameraman, Stephen Tobolowsky (in his best known role) as aggressive insurance salesman Ned Ryerson, Bill's older brother Brian Doyle- Murray as 'groundhog honcho' Buster Green, comedians Rick Ducommun and Rick Overton as scruffy locals, Robin Duke as the diner waitress, and, in his film debut, a young Michael Shannon as a guy getting married.Director / co-writer Harold Ramis, making a cameo as a local neurologist, keeps things headed in clever directions (it's a delicious bit of dark comedy when Phil tries various means of suicide in his attempts to end the cycle), always successfully alternating between the laughs and the more touching elements. In fact, 'Groundhog Day' is simply very sweet as Phil develops more of an interest in an old homeless man's welfare and becomes increasingly attached to Rita. And George Fenton's music always hits just the right notes for any given scene. In short, it's one of the star's best ever vehicles and a consistently entertaining movie worth revisiting.10 out of 10.",10,3,6,2 February 2012
Reservoir Dogs," It took me too long to revisit this modern crime classic.
","Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's feature debut is a viscerally entertaining, powerful, witty, and well acted piece of work that at once showcased his way with dialogue and tendency to leap back and forth in time. A group of lowlife criminals with clashing personalities get together for a diamond robbery that goes horribly wrong. (Now, we never see the actual robbery, but the vivid descriptions supplied by the characters still tell us what we need to know, and truth be told, it works just as well in ones' imagination.) Now the survivors have holed up in a warehouse where, in between their verbal attacks on one another, they work at figuring out what went wrong, and realize that one of their own has to have been a rat. You know you're going to be in for an interesting time when a group of grown men are debating the message in the lyrics to Madonna songs; this is just one example of the way Tarantino really cares about character and dialogue. Here, of course, he was already dropping pop culture references (Marvel Comics characters, the TV series 'Get Christie Love') and quoting the movies that influenced him, in his approach to telling this story. It's often effectively gory, and many people are quite familiar with the show stopping torture sequence, even though in actuality we don't see the worst of it. The whole thing is grimly compelling; this odd assemblage of characters reveal little details about themselves throughout and often just get on each others' nerves. No matter how ugly this may get, it's the kind of thing one just keeps watching. A top notch cast excels, including Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, ex-con turned author & screenwriter Eddie Bunker, Tarantino himself, and legendary movie business tough guy / wild man Lawrence Tierney in one of his best over roles. The eclectic soundtrack is a treat to listen to, with Stealers Wheel rightfully earning, at the time, newfound appreciation for their old song 'Stuck in the Middle with You'. Solidly entertaining all the way through, 'Reservoir Dogs' served as a fine announcement to the world that a fresh talent had arrived, and holds up extremely well. It's gripping stuff that could work just as well on the stage, always striking and never boring. Eight out of 10.",8,0,0,11 May 2012
Total Recall," One of Arnold's best vehicles.
","'Total Recall' offers fine slam bang action and an intriguing, twist-laden story, co-scripted by Ronald Shusett & Dan O'Bannon ('Alien', 'Dead & Buried') based on the story 'We Can Remember it for You Wholesale' by Philip K. Dick. Production design, visual effects, makeup, and atmosphere are all vividly realized in this fun movie that comes up with some great concepts along the way. As entertainment, it certainly does its job. Schwarzenegger gets one (actually, more than one) of his more complex roles, as blue collar guy Douglas Quaid who wants something more out of life, and has developed an obsession with the planet Mars. He knows of a company named Rekall that creates artificial memories of lavish vacations, and figures it will be 'safer' than the real thing, so, not being able to get Mars out of his head, goes to Rekall for their Mars package - the scenario he chooses casts him as a secret agent - only to find out that he is not 'real', and is simply the new identity for another character. After his arrival on Mars, he finds that his mission will be to help stop the power crazed megalomaniac Cohaagen (Ronny Cox), who cruelly controls the fates of the Mars inhabitants, mutants and humans alike. Some scenes and images here are highly memorable, and director Paul Verhoeven, who'd previously given us another satirical look at a grim future in 'RoboCop', takes the violence to a hysterically over the top level; one's gotta love the chase sequence where one poor innocent schmuck is used as a human shield. Also noteworthy are the scenes where Quaid removes a 'bug' from his skull, by going through the nostril, and where a disguise of his starts malfunctioning. Everything is done on a grand scale, including the pounding music score by Jerry Goldsmith. And the actors supporting Arnold are exceptionally well chosen, with Cox and the always intimidating Michael Ironside (who was initially considered for the title role in 'RoboCop'!) making for nasty, formidable villains. Rachel Ticotin is feisty as the 'sleazy and demure' leading lady Melina, with Sharon Stone adding plenty of sex appeal as Quaid's dubious wife; she figures in a payoff scene that features one of Arnold's many well loved cinematic one-liners in 'Considuh dat a dee-vorse!' Fine character players dot the landscape, too, including Marshall Bell, Michael Champion, Roy Brocksmith, Ray Baker, Dean Norris, Robert Costanzo, Marc Alaimo, Michael Gregory, and Mickey Jones; Robert Picardo supplies the voice of the priceless 'Johnnycab', and Lycia Naff and Debbie Lee Carrington have two of the best roles in the feature; Naff's bosom will definitely stick in the mind (it WILL make guys wish they had three hands). Makeup effects expert Rob Bottin finally won a richly deserved Academy Award for his work here. Humorous, lively, and interesting, 'Total Recall' has fine forward momentum and packs its scenes with details, never letting filler get in the way of a good story and offering crowd pleasing thrills. It's a diverting movie from beginning to end. Eight out of 10.",8,1,4,22 April 2012
Don't Breathe," Requires much suspension of disbelief.
","Three young punks - Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette), and 'Money' (Daniel Zovatto) - are experienced at home robberies. Rocky and Alex (who's in love with her) are somewhat more even keeled. 'Money' is just a plain pile of scum. They hear about a potential huge windfall to come from invading the home of an isolated, blind Iraq war vet (Stephen Lang). Supposedly he got a nice juicy settlement from the filthy rich family of a girl who'd killed the vets' daughter in a traffic accident.Getting inside the house is not too hard. However, the blind man is much more formidable an adversary than these brainless punks realize.I can see how many viewers would take the story (concocted by Rodo Sayagues and director Fede Alvarez) to task. There's barely a believable moment in it, starting with the fact that it takes an eternity before we ever hear police sirens, despite all the gunfire throughout the movie.Provided viewers can put their own brains in neutral, there IS entertainment to be derived from 'Don't Breathe', but that's due to the execution, not the concept. Alvarez creates some effective suspense and atmosphere within this house, and there's visceral pleasures to be had from the violence. (If you can't stand any of the characters, you might at least enjoy seeing them being put through so much hell.) The script manages at least one amusing twist - which makes no sense, but does put Langs' character into perspective for you.The acting from Levy, Minnette, and Zovatto is adequate; her more so than the others, because she at least gets a character that is fleshed out to some degree. Veteran actor Lang, who's often specialized in creepy or outright psychotic roles, steals the show as the blind man, even if he only has about 13 lines or so, most of them towards the end of the picture.Filmed in (and set in) Detroit, although the interiors of the house were actually done in a studio in Hungary.Seven out of 10.",7,1,2,21 November 2017
Sicario," This is the land of wolves now.
","Emily Blunt plays Kate Macer, the leader of a rescue response unit with the FBI. She gets recruited for a major offensive against drug cartels in Mexico, having to work for some very cagey people. The guy in charge is Matt Graver (Josh Brolin), and he's not forthcoming with many details. She also must deal with an enigmatic stranger named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), along for the ride in some sort of advisory capacity. There will be some surprises in store for Kate as she embarks upon this sordid journey.The term 'Sicario' gets explained at the outset; in Mexico, it's the word for 'hitman'. That lets us know that we're going to be in for something a bit different. You won't see the sort of typical action-movie treatment of such material. In fact, there are no real action set pieces to speak of. In their place, we get a nuanced, low-key, somewhat grounded drama of cops vs. crooks. We also get a narrative (written by Taylor Sheridan) in which 'good' guys aren't always so clearly defined, and where you have people like Graver, whose job it is to sort of 'shake things up' so that drug lords like Fausto Alarcon (Julio Cesar Cedillo) deviate from their usual patterns. In the end, this war on drugs reduces some people to utterly ruthless and cold-blooded methods.Director Denis Villeneuve never tries to dazzle you. His filmmaking efficiency is of a more matter-of-fact style, as he eases you into the story bit by bit. There is a fairly devastating explosion (and loss of life) near the beginning that does influence Kates' actions for the rest of the picture, and a decent shootout in traffic as obviously unsavoury types are spotted by the authorities.Extremely well shot (the cinematography is by Roger Deakins, so that comes as no surprise), it features good acting by a cast also including Victor Garber ('Titanic' '97), Jon Bernthal ('The Walking Dead'), Daniel Kaluuya ('Get Out'), Jeffrey Donovan ('Burn Notice'), and Raoul Max Trujillo ('Apocalypto'). Blunt is fine as an idealistic young woman who gets an eye-opening, Brolin is pretty amusing, and Del Toro is excellent as he gives a very controlled performance.Much tragedy and devastation has been the result of decades of drug wars, and 'Sicario' illustrates this quite well.Seven out of 10.",7,1,2,10 July 2018
Jack Reacher," An interesting, if imperfect, murder-mystery.
","Tom Cruise gets to play a different sort of badass in this initial film adaptation of the work of Lee Child. Jack Reacher is a former military man who, after mustering out of service, deliberately fell off the grid and became something of a mystery man.When a young sniper (Joseph Sikora), himself ex-military, takes out five supposedly random victims, he leaves enough evidence behind to ensure that he is soon caught by police. At his questioning, he does not speak but merely scrawls on a sheet of paper, 'Get Jack Reacher.' And so Jack shows up in town, and is drafted by defence attorney Helen (Rosamund Pike) to serve as a sort of investigator. What the two of them discover is that things are naturally not all that clear, that there are layers to this story and twists along the way.One misgiving that I remember viewers had at the time was that Cruise seemed to be miscast, that he was not how author Child had originally envisioned the character. But give Cruise credit; he knows how to work that movie-star persona and create a 'hero' who lives in a somewhat grey area, morally. He's not the Dudley Do-Right type. But Jack sticks around when he realizes how complicated and untenable the situation is getting, and is a man of his word.The story is certainly entertaining, if not all that satisfying; for the most part, it's lacking in truly compelling villains. If you're anything like this viewer, you probably watched this because the legendary character / highly esteemed filmmaker Werner Herzog plays the main bad guy. But the script doesn't give him much to do that's interesting. He does have one great scene where he shows an underling how many digits are missing from his hands.Still, it's Herzog and Robert Duvall (who turns up late in the story as a crusty but reliable old firing range owner / operator) who lend some gravitas to the proceedings, along with an appealing performance by the lovely Pike, and solid work by Richard Jenkins (as her dad, who happens to be the district attorney) and David Oyelowo (as a police detective).The action scenes are certainly adequate, and some moments are played with a definite amount of humour. The plot isn't fleshed out that well, but it does touch upon some provocative themes, such as life for some soldiers during and after their service.Reasonably slick filmmaking helps make this entertaining. And some people may appreciate this being the kind of feature that is violent without containing much in the way of gore.Seven out of 10.",7,0,0,24 August 2018
The Departed," Scorsese in his element.
","Screenwriter William Monahan and filmmaker Martin Scorsese do *very* well here, adapting the 2002 Hong Kong film 'Infernal Affairs' for a North American audience. The nifty premise is that gangland boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson, in one of his last great roles and performances) has spent his time nurturing Colin Sullivan (played as an adult by Matt Damon), who's now his mole inside the State Department. At the same time, a newcomer to Franks' gang, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is actually a detective so deep undercover that only his handlers (Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg) know that he's a cop. So we have both the cops and the crooks shaken by these obvious 'plants' in their units.This truly was ideal material for Scorsese, who understandably won an Academy Award for his fine direction. Although it seems awfully unwieldy at just over two and a half hours long, this viewer never lost interest in it. This is due to genuinely excellent storytelling, a great Boston, Mass. flavour, many colourful characters (and performances), and Scorsese's typically potent, visceral style. Granted, some viewers may not care for seeing some of this violence rendered digitally, but the script does take some interesting turns, and may even have a surprise or two in store for some viewers. The often profane dialogue is highly amusing, with Wahlberg having some of the choicest quips.Scorsese works with a first-rate cast here (other luminaries include Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmiga, and Ray Winstone, and top character players like David O'Hara, Mark Rolston, and James Badge Dale). Nicholson electrifies in his charismatic latter-day performance. And DiCaprio is solid in the role of a man determined to overcome his sordid family history.Overall, this is well worth a viewing to see a master filmmaker at work. It drops you right into the action (with a bit of back story); the title doesn't show up until almost 20 minutes in, and the vast majority of the credits are saved for the end.Eight out of 10.",8,0,2,31 January 2020
Die Hard," The way an action movie should be done.
","Loosely based on the novel 'Nothing Lasts Forever' by Roderick Thorp, and scripted by Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza, 'Die Hard' is very much one of THE quintessential action movies of the modern era, delivering many thrills and laughs for over two hours.It gave TV star Bruce Willis one of the defining film roles of his career, as a frustrated, foul mouthed, yet very human and talkative average Joe detective forced into becoming the hero, when a slick group of nasty terrorists infiltrate a high rise office building and cause havoc. John McClane (Willis) has to rely on his own wits and resilience to save the day when the odds seem to be outrageously stacked against him. To add to that, most of the authority figures on the outside turn out to be useless, to put it charitably.Willis is engaging in the lead, and convincing in action and fight sequences as well. One of the most appreciable and interesting facets to the movie is indeed the 'cat and mouse' game he plays with the terrorist leader, a man named Hans Gruber. The always excellent Alan Rickman, at the time a very well respected Shakespearan actor, makes a hell of a film debut as Hans. Hans is an intriguing character because on one hand he's a well dressed, confident, intelligent, and cultured man, yet at the same time, he's a cold blooded creep. The other well developed relationship in the story is between John and L.A.P.D. sergeant Al Powell (future TV star Reginald VelJohnson, in his break through film role), the only person on the outside with more than half a brain in his head and who repeatedly offers John the words of encouragement that he needs.Lovely Bonnie Bedelia may play the only substantial female role in the movie, as Johns' estranged wife, Holly, but she's a tough cookie who does have the courage to stand up to Hans as he and his men throw their weight around. Alexander Godunov, who'd previously appeared in 'Witness', is great fun as the thuggish, vengeance crazed goon Karl, who proves so indestructible near the end he comes off as a horror movie type of villain. Paul Gleason portrays inept, thoughtless deputy police chief Dwayne Robinson, a humourless jerk who served as a prototype for similar roles in future action movies. Other unlikable weasels are memorably portrayed by William Atherton (the stubborn, very self serving reporter) and Hart Bochner (the coke snorting corporate sleaze who foolishly thinks he can reason with Hans). Even the FBI agents on this case (Robert Davi, Grand L. Bush) come off as pretty dumb and don't express too much concern for the hostages. A number of other familiar faces in small roles, too: James Shigeta as corporation boss Takagi, De'voreaux White as the likable limo driver Argyle, Clarence Gilyard Jr. ('Walker: Texas Ranger') as the electronics expert Theo, Al Leong as candy bar thief / terrorist Uli, comedian Rick Ducommun as the city worker, and Mary Ellen Trainor (recognizable to action fans as the psychiatrist in the 'Lethal Weapon' series) as the lady newscaster.'Die Hard' is rough, tough, violent, hair-raising stuff. Although somewhat overextended at two hours and 13 minutes, it never gets dull. Director John McTiernan, who'd already proved his abilities on *his* breakthrough movie, 'Predator', guides it all in style, and he and his crew are up to the challenge of shooting sequences in some tight spots. Michael Kamens' music is thrilling, and the special effects by Richard Edlunds' Boss Corporation are most impressive. Often very funny (with a generous dose of quotable dialogue), the story has genuinely touching moments as well. The big finish is especially riveting.True filmmaking craftsmanship results in superior visceral entertainment the entire time. Four sequels have followed it so far.In closing, it would be impossible to imagine a fan of this genre not having a copy of this movie in his or her movie collection.10 out of 10.",10,1,2,3 December 2011
Psycho," 'A boy's best friend is his Mother.'
","Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' still stands tall as one of the most riveting shockers ever made. At the time, it was an interesting experiment for the director, having been filmed on a low budget and in black & white. It introduced characters and scenes that became an enormous part of the popular culture and influenced a GREAT many films that followed.Based on the novel by Robert Bloch (itself inspired by the exploits of real-life madman Ed Gein), it manages one of the absolute best twists in plot to be committed to film, making us believe it's about secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her impulsive theft of her boss' clients' money, only to jerk the rug out from under us in a now legendary 'shower sequence'. Marion makes the fateful decision of seeking shelter in the way-out-of-the-way Bates Motel, run by peculiar young man Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a seemingly wimpy person who's dominated by his shrewish Mother.It's a testament to how powerful and endlessly entertaining 'Psycho' is, that it can continue to enthral us no matter how many times we see it. Hitchcocks' murder set pieces are the kind you never forget, and they're made all the more so by the most infamous (and imitated) of all of Bernard Herrmanns' music scores. It really helps to drive the movie forward, and Hitch and company create some truly delicious atmosphere, especially when it comes to *that* house, looking sinister and foreboding up on its hill. Screenwriter Joseph Stefano does impressive things with dialogue and a top notch cast memorably brings the characters to life. Perkins is just tremendous in the role of Norman, so tremendous that the role and performance would loom large for the rest of his life and career. Vera Miles is wonderfully feisty as Marions' sister, who'll stop at nothing to find her, while John Gavin makes for a stoic hero. Leigh is winning in the role of the larcenous Marion and her scenes with Perkins are superb. Great character players like Martin Balsam, John McIntire, Frank Albertson, John Anderson, Mort Mills, and Simon Oakland round out the cast, while Hitchs' daughter Pat plays the role of Caroline.They all help to make watching this a rich experience, one that can look even better after repeat viewings, with elements (the bird imagery & references, for example) one might not fully appreciate on the first viewing. This is a movie milestone that everybody ought to see at least once.Followed by three sequels, the TV movie 'Bates Motel', a remake, and the 'Bates Motel' TV series.10 out of 10.",10,0,0,26 October 2012
The Witch," A cut above a lot of other modern horror.
","A God fearing family manages to end up banished from their village in 17th Century New England. They decide to set up cabin and ranch at the edge of a truly spooky forest. Their troubles are only beginning when their adorable newborn son Samuel disappears without a trace. And a lot of the blame is laid at the feet of the teen aged daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy).We never ever see very much of the title character in this effort by writer & director Robert Eggers. He chooses to parcel out his true horror rather carefully, instead focusing on creating a mood and atmosphere that is absolutely stifling. His film is somber, serious, and even depressing. It's definitely not for all tastes. It sets a tone in a sequence approximately eight minutes in, involving Samuel. This will cause 'The Witch' to lose some viewers, for sure, but all I can say in Eggers' defense is that he spares us the goriest details.Eggers was inspired by a variety of folklore, fairy tales (I can certainly see a 'Hansel & Gretel' influence), and records of settlers during this time in North American history. His *very* literate dialogue is often taken from these records. The dialogue and its delivery is therefore highly antiquated, so that's one other thing that some viewers might not care for. But it's refreshing that Eggers takes such a careful, measured approach to telling a tale that could be referred to as 'slow burn' horror. The look for this picture is perfect; its drab visuals are very suitable to the story being told. But don't worry; there is some gore here and there.The performances are incredibly sincere and intense. Taylor-Joy has tremendous appeal in the lead role. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are superb as the parents. Harvey Scrimshaw delivers a mature performance as the son Caleb. Bathsheba Garnett has such a creepy presence in her seconds of screen time as the true form of the Witch. And the goat Black Phillip manages to be quite the character too, especially towards the end.Overall, an interesting fable open to some interpretation, with many themes and questions of faith throughout.Eight out of 10.",8,4,8,4 June 2016
30 Days of Night," A fun fright flick.
","It's always nice to see a different take on a genre. One may find out that it's not wholly original, but at least it will be something that they themselves haven't seen before. In this case, the idea of 'vampires in the snow', turned into a successful graphic novel by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith, did intrigue this viewer. These blood suckers are a particularly animalistic and aggressive - and unrelentingly merciless - bunch, led by a monster named Marlow (Danny Huston). They come upon the small Alaska town of Barrow, the Northern most town in the entire United States, which regularly experiences the natural phenomenon of a whole month without sunlight - which gives our survivors, including intrepid young sheriff Eben (Josh Hartnett) one more thing to worry about, and the villains one less thing. Can Eben and his fellow intended victims hold out for that long? Commendably, never once do these filmmakers intimate that there will definitely be some sort of happy ending. The atmosphere is just overwhelming, and the creation of this remote wintry town, with on location filming in New Zealand, is impressive to behold. While there are clich√©s to be found in this screenplay, we never learn much about the motivation of the vampires themselves - which don't adhere to all vampire 'rules', as they can be eliminated with bullets - making them enigmatic entities indeed, and the human element is never lost. One can believe that these are real human beings, with all of their imperfections, that are at risk here. Some absolutely beautiful shots at beginning and end truly show off the majesty - and danger - of this landscape. There's tons of violence and gore to satisfy some tastes, and some decent suspense to go along with it. However, some of the best stuff revolves the 'God's eye' view of the town as it gets completely ravaged by this seemingly unstoppable force, creating a feeling of utter helplessness. Hartnett actually does a pretty good job in the lead, with Melissa George appealing as his leading lady, and capable support by Ben Foster as the weirdo stranger who helps to signal the arrival of the enemy, Mark Boone Junior as scruffy, solitary local Beau, and Mark Rendall as younger brother Jake. It's also nice to see Peter Feeney, the greedy, tweedy bad guy from the splatter comedy 'Black Sheep', in a small role, and Huston, son of the legendary John H. and half-brother of Angelica H., making a pretty strong impression in this role that never receives much elaboration. Stylish, energetic filmmaking makes this a good entertainment with a strong dose of nastiness along the way. Eight out of 10.",8,4,5,26 December 2011
Wedding Crashers," An engaging romantic comedy.
","Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn make a good team as John and Jeremy, two serial womanizers who regularly crash weddings to pick up girls. This has been their tradition for a while, but things go awry when they crash the wedding of the eldest daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken). John finds himself falling hard for Claire, daughter # 2 (a radiant Rachel McAdams), and Jeremy gets targeted by Gloria, daughter # 3 (Isla Fisher), a 'stage five clinger' who develops a serious infatuation with him.Overall, 'Wedding Crashers' is a fun, if overlong, movie that delivers enough good laughs to keep it watchable. Some of the humour is of course pretty raunchy, and some of the dialogue rather colourful, but there are some amusing moments. Glorias' late-night bout of kinkiness is a good example.John and Jeremy are characters who might have run the risk of coming off as incredibly sleazy, but Wilson and Vaughn never overdo it, and their amiability does go a long way. But the real value of 'Wedding Crashers' is that it offers good comic opportunities for many cast members. Walken is effective, sometimes edging into typical Walken-esque eccentricities, but also making sure to project some actual sense of authority and intimidation. The gorgeous McAdams is ideal, and it's not hard to see why the John character would be so taken with her. Fisher is hilarious as the seemingly unhinged, spoiled-rotten Gloria.Bradley Cooper, a few years before 'The Hangover', portrays the arrogant rich jerk who's actually been dating Claire, and the fact that she clearly shouldn't be with him is obvious from the get-go. Jane Seymour is a hoot as Walkens' hot-to-trot wife. Ellen Albertini Dow is fun as his cranky, foul-mouthed mother. And Ron Canada, as the butler, gets to deliver some priceless lines. Dwight Yoakam and Rebecca DeMornay have cameo roles in the opening minutes; there's also a special (unbilled) guest star who pops up towards the end of the movie.'Wedding Crashers' is ultimately plenty predictable, but getting to the end is still a reasonably good time, and there's enough emotional content to keep things on a fairly even keel.Seven out of 10.",7,1,1,12 June 2019
Ice Age," Completely endearing.
","The Looney Tunes spirit is kept alive and well in this likable computer animated feature, that also continues the tradition started by 'Toy Story' in having humour for younger and older viewers. It's also got real heart and soul, and characters that are never less than entertaining. It can often bring a lump to ones' throat, just as much as it elicits chuckles with its one liners and visual gags. Set during the title time in Earths' history, it brings together three very unlikely comrades - a solitary mammoth named Manfred (voice of Ray Romano), a goof ball sloth named Sid (voice of John Leguizamo), and a sabre toothed tiger named Diego (voice of Denis Leary). Their mission is to return a human baby to its tribe, although Diegos' motive has nothing to do with wanting to do the 'right' thing. Punctuated by the misadventures of a prehistoric squirrel named Scrat (voice of director Chris Wedge), just as terminally unlucky as Wile E. Coyote himself, 'Ice Age' is hard to resist, right from start to finish. The characters are wittily and inventively realized visually, especially Sid, the kind of character who can be seen as annoying but who is also very likable in his way. Leguizamo is a standout in this role, getting most of the big laughs. Other talents providing voices are Goran Visnjic as Soto, and Jack Black as Zeke, as well as Cedric the Entertainer, Stephen Root, Diedrich Bader, Alan Tudyk, and Jane Krakowski. Some scenes of peril may indeed be too much for the very young to take, but for others there is a deliciously dark edge to some of the humour, especially in regards to the dodo birds. There's also a very nice message in here about looking out for others, as well as one about redemption. All in all, a fine family feature, one that charms and amuses for a well paced 81 minutes.

Army of Darkness," 'Good, bad. I'm the guy with the gun.'
","Briefly recapping the previous films in the 'Evil Dead' franchise, 'Army of Darkness' then picks up as the poor, bedeviled Ash (Bruce Campbell) is magically transported back to 1300 A.D. and the days of Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert). He learns that in order to get back to his original time and place, he must once again lay his hands on that damned book known as the Necronomicon. His evolution into obnoxious moron now complete, Ash is so dense that he can only remember two of the three words that he needs to utter before removing the book from its resting place. In so doing, he resurrects an army of skeletal warriors (a nice nod to 'Jason and the Argonauts') that will be led by an evil version of himself.Some fans of the previous movies simply don't care for this entry, largely because it's much too comedic and silly, not to mention light on true horror, for their tastes. But this viewer has always loved it, because it seems that co-writer / director Sam Raimi (who penned the script with his brother Ivan) was having so much fun. 'Army of Darkness' is basically a spoof of the entire medieval fantasy genre, and it has some great gags, in addition to some highly quotable dialogue. ('Gimme some sugar, baby.') The studly Campbell shows off plenty of comedy chops in the leading role, who through the course of the story finally becomes a genuine hero. Production design (by Tony Tremblay) and cinematography (by Bill Pope) are wonderfully atmospheric, and the effects, for the most part, are delightfully done. Past Raimi collaborator Joseph LoDuca composes most of the music, with Danny Elfman supplying a rousing new 'March of the Dead' theme.Campbell is nicely supported by the lovely Embeth Davidtz as leading lady Sheila, Ian Abercrombie as the old wise man, and Richard Grove as Arthurs' human nemesis Duke Henry the Red. 'Evil Dead' fan Bridget Fonda has a cameo as Linda; also doing the cameo thing are Patricia Tallman as the gnarly possessed witch, and Raimis' actor brother Ted (in a few roles). Bill Moseley plays a Deadite captain.Among the highlights: Ash being tortured by miniature versions of himself, his duels with Evil Ash, and the final raid on Arthurs' castle & compound.Eight out of 10.",8,2,3,29 November 2015
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Big budget production has a lot going for it.
","This incredibly lavish film, courtesy of screenwriter James V. Hart and director Francis Ford Coppola, is a very respectful adaptation of the classic Bram Stoker novel, so much so that Coppola gave ownership of the story to the author in the film's official title. It's got all of the wonderful sets, costumes, and special effects that money can buy, and has plenty of dark and stormy atmosphere. The set pieces are memorable, as are the various guises for the immortal blood sucker, who in this instance is connected to the real life historical figure of Vlad the Impaler, who loses his beloved wife Elisabeta upon her receipt of (false) news of his death, and furiously renounces God, living on through the centuries as an undead fiend who decides to put down roots in late 19th century London. He fixates upon the lovely Mina (Winona Ryder), the spitting image of his long lost love, but an intrepid team of vampire hunters are determined to prevent his reign of terror from enduring. Right from the start, it's amazing just how much pizazz Coppola and company put into this thing, and he and his cast & crew deliver entertainment on a grand scale; the ambiance is just overwhelming, and the film not only succeeds on a visceral level (with generous doses of the red stuff) but an emotional level as well. It's important to note that Dracula is not an entirely unsympathetic figure, and his scenes with both Mina and Lucy (Sadie Frost) have the appropriately sensual, seductive quality. The most potent ingredient in the mix is the phenomenal performance of Gary Oldman, one of the great actors of his generation who is never less than completely convincing, whether he's being forlorn or just plain creepy. Anthony Hopkins (as Van Helsing), who actually generates most of the laughs, Richard E. Grant (as Dr. Seward), Cary Elwes (as Arthur Holmwood), and Bill Campbell (as Quincey Morris, the Texan) comprise a wonderful supporting cast, and singer Tom Waits is most amusingly cast as the inimitable Renfield; Keanu Reeves gives the role of Jonathan Harker an honest effort, but he's simply miscast and tends to stick out too much. Be sure to look out for the likes of Monica Bellucci and Jay Robinson in small parts. A first rate technical crew includes cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, production designer Thomas Sanders, costume designer Eiko Ishioka, and composer Wojciech Kilar, who immerse us in this vivid environment totally and completely; the period recreation is as good as one could want it. The film gets particularly rousing towards the end with the journey to Dracula's castle through snowy weather, although the final battle is over rather quickly. Nevertheless, this is great fun, and can rightfully take its place among other cinematic interpretations of the Dracula tale. Eight out of 10.",8,0,2,13 May 2012
Con Air," Watch this movie or the bunny gets it.
","'Con Air' is simply the perfect movie to watch if the viewer wants nothing more than to be entertained in high style for two hours. The beauty of it is, the filmmakers *know* this ain't exactly the smartest movie out there, far from it, but they do a superb job of taking this goofy escapism to a delightfully over the top place, blowing up stuff REAL good and giving us a bunch of memorable characters, starting with hero Nicolas Cage as former Army Ranger Cameron Poe, jailed for killing a man in self defense, and now being paroled. On his flight home is a delicious assortment of the worst of the worst, society's unrepentant scum featuring such people as rapist 'Johnny-23' (Danny Trejo), black militant 'Diamond Dog' (Ving Rhames), and mass murderer 'Billy Bedlam' (Nick Chinlund), as well as guys like 'Swamp Thing' (M.C. Gainey), 'Pinball' (Dave Chappelle), and Hannibal Lecter like psychopath Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi). Presiding over all is crafty nut job Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom, played by John Malkovich, who plays the role with true gusto. The law is shown is to be pretty incompetent here, as typified by Colm Meaney's obnoxious D.E.A. agent Duncan Malloy. But, hey, at least they've got Vince Larkin (John Cusack) on their side, the only guy other than Poe who has more than half a brain in his head. The decibel level is cranked way up in this flashy, snazzy action movie that has many inspired moments. One's got to believe that a fair amount of this humour was intentional. The fate of the sneaky drug dealer Francisco Cindino (Jesse Borrego) is a hoot, and it serves as yet another fine example of the necessity in action movies to come up with appropriate witticisms when bad guys bite the dust. Another perfect moment shows that there are MUCH worse things that can mess up a car other than bird poop. Use of the Lynyrd Skynyrd classic 'Sweet Home Alabama' is inspired. Buscemi, who's great as always, steals his scenes and has some of the best lines; the filmmakers show some brevity in intimating who could be his next victim. Lovely ladies Monica Potter and Rachel Ticotin hold their own well, but this is still very much a show for the guys, who are sure to appreciate it. The special effects are excellent and the pacing flawless - these two hours go by quicker than one would think. Granted, the movie does feature at least two climaxes, but by the time it's over it's a guarantee that all the bad guys will get theirs. And Cage is just a gas, right from that hairdo to the overdone accent. Nobody can say this guy ever gives too little to a role. And Mykelti Williamson is effectively likable as his diabetic buddy who motivates his actions for much of the story. All in all, 'Con Air' is purely fun Hollywood nonsense, right from start to finish. Watch it and you'll realize the importance of leaving stuffed animals where you find them.

Jaws," 'This was not a boat accident!'
","*The* original, classic man vs. nature thriller that ushered in the era of the 'summer blockbuster', 'Jaws' remains vivid, believable, and highly effective, more than 40 years after it was first released. Everything about it is memorable, from its set pieces to its shocks to its cast to its music to a young Steven Spielbergs' masterful direction, and these elements can thrill even the viewer who's seen them before. Any summer season simply wouldn't be complete without a viewing of it. The story is straightforward and compelling; the screenplay (final credit is given to author Peter Benchley and screenwriter / actor Carl Gottlieb, who plays newspaperman Meadows) trims the melodramatic fat from the Benchley novel and goes right for the thrills, which come frequently.The story deals with a resort island community, named Amity, that finds its livelihood - and its citizens & visitors - threatened by a rogue great white shark, which just refuses to go away and insists on staying where the eating is good. Eventually, an expedition is launched to find and destroy the beast.Roy Scheider is perfect as the Everyman hero, police chief Martin Brody, who tries to do the right thing and protect the people even when local authorities, mainly represented by stupidly stubborn mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), stress to him the importance of a financially successful summer season. Richard Dreyfuss is fun as the rich kid shark expert who tries to educate Vaughn and others on the facts of the great white. And Robert Shaw, in a scenery chewing performance, is brilliant as salty fisherman Quint, who has a generous array of the most quotable lines, including a speech regarding the men of the USS Indianapolis. Fine support is provided by Hamilton, Lorraine Gary as the loving and supportive wife, and Jeffrey Kramer as the deputy.On location shooting in Martha's Vineyard supplies plenty of wonderful flavour, and who can ever forget *that* music by John Williams, the composer / conductor who's given us some of the best, most instantly recognizable movie themes of all time?The stories of the making of the movie are now the stuff of legend, with the inability to get mechanical shark 'Bruce' to function properly the ultimate happy accident, forcing the filmmakers to use subjective camera work and a very simple cue from Williams to indicate the sharks' presence. Among the iconic sequences are those of the first victim (Susan Backlinie) meeting her doom, the misguided attempt by two fishermen to catch the shark, Brody and Hoopers' night time search for the fish and an unpleasant surprise that drops into frame, the entire second half which is seagoing adventure at its finest, and the aforementioned USS Indianapolis speech.An enduring part of the popular culture if ever there was one, 'Jaws' is one of those movie milestones that any fan of the cinema ought to see at least once. It was extremely influential in its time, spawning a bunch of similar 'nature strikes back' thrillers, and to this day it would be hard to swim in the ocean or just *think* of the ocean and not have 'Jaws' on the brain.10 out of 10.",10,4,6,26 June 2012
Kong: Skull Island," Some decent monster madness in this one.
","Not really connected to other 'King Kong' films in terms of story or characters, this is a reboot for the new century, telling the familiar apes' story for a new generation. A bunch of dreamers / monster chasers led by Bill Randa (John Goodman) are accompanied by a military escort as they set out to explore a newfound South Pacific island. They'll find that the main occupant is an ENORMOUS gorilla (this may be the hugest Kong on record) - but there is absolutely no shortage of formidable creatures on the island. Leading the military is an officer (Samuel L. Jackson) who is a bitter warrior in need of a new enemy. Hired to guide this bunch of dummies is a British tracker named Conrad (Tom Hiddleston).You do have to be pretty undemanding to get into 'Kong: Skull Island'. The script is rubbish, with far too many ridiculous characters and far too much awful dialogue. It's also in the mold of a lot of modern Hollywood product, with the filmmakers seemingly hellbent on making sure that their audience is not bored. To that end, there's quite a bit of good monster action, as Kong is joined by a spider with VERY tall legs, giant wildebeest type things, a giant fresh water squid, and a menagerie of lizard type animals dubbed 'skull crawlers'. The movie is never more entertaining than when it focuses on Kong and his battles with his fellow island dwellers.As for these people who are foolish enough to invade Kongs' domain, who really cares? Some of the actors - Hiddleston, Goodman, the gorgeous Brie Larson - manage to survive with some dignity intact. John C. Reilly adds a fair amount of the comedy relief with his role as a soldier who's been stuck on the island since the second World War. Jackson actually delivers a performance instead of just being a personality, but his character is one of the most absurd.This does benefit from some lovely Hawaiian scenery, effectively shot in widescreen. And the CGI is actually some of the best that this viewer has seen; it doesn't look overly cartoonish. Kong is performed capably through the motion capture technique by Terry Notary and Toby Kebbell (the latter also plays the soldier Jack Chapman).This viewer can understand why some people would be unimpressed, but was able to take the bad with the good, and have a reasonably fun time with this.The use of all the rock songs got to be annoying. I didn't need *that* many reminders that this story takes place in 1973.Six out of 10.",6,1,2,15 September 2017
Arrival," Scores high marks for good intentions.
","Amy Adams acts her heart out in the role of Louise Banks, a renowned linguist who's recruited by the military when 12 mysterious spacecraft touch down (well, so to speak) in odd spots around the globe. The military hopes to get her to break through to the aliens and determine the nature of this otherworldly visit. Meanwhile, Louise is understandably sombre after having suffered a devastating personal tragedy. Much of the plot hinges on this incredible gift that Louise has, which she will attempt to utilize to avoid disaster.It's better not to reveal any more about story; some of these details and twists may actually come as unexpected.At first glance, this seems to be a somewhat different approach to alien 'invasion' cinema. It's more intelligent than some entries into the genre, and more subtle, attempting to put a more 'realistic' spin on what might happen were the people of Earth to be actually visited by an extraterrestrial intelligence. It's not for people who want action and spectacle. After a while, you do realize that this also a true human-interest drama, perhaps too drawn-out and manipulative to some viewers, but will definitely hit home for any parent who's ever lost a child, and/or had to watch them suffer.The film co-stars Jeremy Renner, as the scientist with whom Louise will work, Forest Whitaker, as a no-nonsense colonel supervising their efforts, Michael Stuhlbarg, as a CIA agent, and Tzi Ma, as a Chinese general who stirs the pot a bit. But make no mistake: this is almost entirely Amys' show, and her character is worthy of much sympathy and compassion, even if she seems to act senselessly at times.While 'Arrival' is to be commended for concentrating more on human emotions than visual effects, it must be said that the design of the 'Heptapods' (affectionately dubbed 'Abbott' and 'Costello' by Renner) is pretty effective. The other visuals on the alien ship are similarly striking.Overall, an affecting statement on the beauty of life and the way that the human race perceives things.Scripted by Eric Heisserer, based on the story 'Story of Your Life' by Ted Chiang.Seven out of 10.",7,2,3,10 September 2018
Centurion," Another entertaining effort from ever reliable Neil Marshall.
","The director continues his successful string of titles - 'Dog Soldiers', 'The Descent', and 'Doomsday' - with this stylish take on an old myth. Michael Fassbender, engaging as always, plays Quintus, a centurion with the Roman Army in 117 A.D. who survives an attack on his fort and subsequently takes part in a mission to eliminate the savage warriors known as the Picts. However, the troops get overwhelmed in unfamiliar territory, and Quintus and a select few others make it out alive, intent on rescuing their general (Dominic West) who was captured by the enemy. What Marshall does here is just dive head first into the action, getting any exposition out of the way as quickly as possible, easing us into more character oriented scenes as the story progresses. And the characters are a solidly entertaining bunch, with the effective twist that one of the main antagonists here is a female, the animal like warrior Etain, played by model / actress Olga Kurylenko, who's quite good in the part. The scenery is extremely breathtaking, with superb widescreen photography, and a colour style that mostly avoids brighter colours. This creates a wonderful visual contrast when the Roman troops are besieged by fireballs; the yellow & orange looks great amid the muted blues & greys, etc. The action is respectably intense, with a lot of digital blood spilled as various combatants brutalize each other. Fassbender is well supported by a cast including JJ Feild, David Morrissey, Liam Cunningham, and Noel Clarke as his comrades, as well as the lovely and appealing Imogen Poots as Arianne, ostracized from her fellow Picts, Ulrich Thomsen as Pict leader Gorlacon, and veterans Paul Freeman ('Raiders of the Lost Ark') as Governor Agricola, Andreas Wisniewski ('The Living Daylights', 'Die Hard') as Commander Gratus, and Michael Carter ('An American Werewolf in London', 'Return of the Jedi') as General Antoninus. The story here is pretty simple, but efficiently told and the movie does illustrate some of the horrors of war and fleshes out its characters as much as it can while still maintaining its basic visceral appeal. And the fact that it's inspired by history, when the 9th Legion of the Roman Army vanished in Hibernia, is intriguing and may make a viewer want to do a bit of reading on the subject. Overall, it shows once again Marshall's ability to craft good crowd pleasing diversions with a nice amount of pizazz. Seven out of 10.",7,3,7,22 March 2012
Prometheus," Problematic but not totally without merit.
","Ridley Scott returned to the 'Alien' series universe 33 years after having helmed the visionary sci-fi horror classic, and the results are, rather predictably, only so-so. It hits a number of the same beats as the 1979 film, while also attempting to provide us with answers to some of the questions that it may have provoked in the viewer. Where did the derelict come from? How did it come to be a wrecked hulk? Who was the Space Jockey? And what exactly was the purpose of the cargo?Scott seems to be more or less just going through the motions here, working from a script credited to Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof. 'Prometheus' is technically well made, if obviously not nearly as fresh an experience as 'Alien' was 35 years ago. There's almost zero tension, the characters are mostly just not that interesting, and the plentiful CGI is nowhere near as memorable as the special effects of the original film.Two scientists, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), collect evidence that they find in ancient cave drawings that would seem to indicate that mans' origins lie in the stars above. Together with an assortment of technical crew, a helpful android named David (Michael Fassbender), and icy corporate type Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), they travel in an exploratory vessel to a distant planet, where they make some supposedly interesting discoveries.Scott and his crew do take full advantage of the advances in visual effects over the subsequent decades, so this is a very slick looking film. But it's largely lacking in the thick, overwhelming atmosphere of Scotts' earlier effort, and this whole idea of exploring the mystery behind elements in 'Alien' isn't too satisfying (the prequel to John Carpenters' 'The Thing' suffered from the same problem). Also, to put it quite frankly, it isn't scary at all. It's really not that distinguishable from a lot of other genre productions these days. The one truly memorable sequence involves some emergency surgery.The cast (also starring Idris Elba, Guy Pearce, Sean Harris, and Rafe Spall) is certainly game; Rapace is very earnest in the lead, but the only real standout is indeed Fassbender as the android, who in the tradition of Ash in 'Alien', may make you wonder if he can be trusted.This kills time fairly well for a little over two hours, but it can't help but fall short compared to a superior predecessor.Six out of 10.",6,0,0,14 August 2014
Halloween," As a matter of fact, it *was* the bogeyman.
","An hour and a half long exercise in style, atmosphere, and suspense by director / co-writer / composer John Carpenter, 'Halloween' remains one of his finest works, a top notch slasher film whose incredible success opened the floodgates for scores of similar films. It's done in a true minimalist style, with utterly relentless automaton Michael Myers taking his time and putting much more effort into his stalking, ultimately, than his slashing.'Halloween' is so well executed that, much like 'Psycho' before it (to which 'Halloween' is admittedly indebted) its murder set pieces can still grip the viewer. Carpenter and company try hard to create a true autumn feel as well as a sense of the American Midwest, despite filming this in South Pasadena in the spring, and sometimes they succeed and sometimes they don't, but overall their film is a classic that continues to hold up very well.Making her feature film debut, young Jamie Lee Curtis makes for a likable, sympathetic 'final girl'. Nancy Loomis provides funny comedy relief as wise ass Annie. Sexy P.J. Soles is likewise a hoot as air headed cheerleader Lynda. Strong support is provided by Charles Cyphers as Sheriff Brackett, with long time Carpenter friend Nick Castle impressively creepy as Myers. Star attraction Donald Pleasence is wonderfully sincere and intense as Myers' persistent nemesis Dr. Loomis, really bringing Carpenters' memorable dialogue to life.Fluid camera-work and Dean Cundey's striking cinematography are incredibly important assets. The use of the Panavision aspect ratio enables Carpenter to fill the frame with as much detail as possible while still allowing Myers to ominously linger at the edges. Carpenters' haunting score - reminiscent of Goblins' work for 'Suspiria', and 'Tubular Bells' from 'The Exorcist' - has gone on to become one of *the* iconic horror movie scores, and the film simply wouldn't be the same without it; it makes even the day time scenes rather eerie.Carpenter begins the film with a flourish, and gives it a mighty fine ending that basically shows us that true evil - whether personified in a bogeyman wearing a Shatner mask or not - will never ever go away. True enough that there are elements here that are not exactly original - the use of subjective camera-work to indicate the killers' point of view, the idea of the killer that keeps coming no matter what - although for better or worse 'Halloween' *did* definitively bring them to the public consciousness. The screenplay doesn't hold up to much scrutiny, but overall the film is still so well made and compelling as to remain essential viewing any time of the year, not just tonight.Eight out of 10.",Null,1,2,31 October 2011
Paths of Glory," An excellent anti-war film.
","Star Kirk Douglas knew full well this was a film worth making, and readily agreed when young director Stanley Kubrick (28 at the time) approached him to star in this memorable commentary on the insanity of war, specifically on the demands of military brass to produce results. Scripted by Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson, this tells a convincing and compelling story in high style. Hollywood was loathe to tackle what was deemed controversial material, in the light of Americas' post WWII patriotism, but actor and director stood by the material. This film may not have been profitable in its initial release, but 56 years later its power remains intact.Based on a book by Humphrey Cobb, it tells the tale of trench warfare during WWI. French general Mireau (George Macready) orders his troops on a suicidal mission. When the mission fails, he determines to save face by selecting some of the soldiers for a court martial. The humanistic, realistic Colonel Dax (Douglas) insists on defending the three men - Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker), Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), and Private Ferol (Timothy Carey). However, Dax has his work cut out for him as proving that the fault lies with the brass, rather than the men in the trenches, will be most difficult indeed.A superb cast, also including Adolphe Menjou as General Broulard, Wayne Morris as Lieutenant Roget, Richard Anderson as the prosecutor, Peter Capell as the judge, and Susanne Christian - a.k.a. Christiane Kubrick, who would become the directors' wife for the next 40 plus years - as the German singer, helps bring this story to life. The mostly percussive music score by Gerald Fried also serves to drive the story forward without calling a lot of attention to itself. Genuinely harrowing battle footage is well staged and executed, and even though emotions are mostly held in check the plight of the three doomed soldiers earns our sympathies; when they start breaking down it's tough to see. And Kubricks' use of the moving camera adds a lot to the scenes in the trenches.With an impassioned performance by Douglas at its core, 'Paths of Glory' is a quietly potent film and easily stands tall as one of the best films of its kind ever made.10 out of 10.",10,0,1,13 June 2013
Carrie," Features the prom to beat all proms.
","This striking, memorable adaptation of the Stephen King novel announced the arrival of the author in a major way, and also made stars of director Brian De Palma and his cast. It still stands tall as one of cinema's ultimate 'loser strikes back' fables and while it may be fiction its themes are still quite relevant. Sissy Spacek excels as the title character, an awkward teenager treated terribly by her fellow students and having to deal with the overbearing presence of her sanctimonious mother (Piper Laurie), a deeply religious individual. Things seem to be improving for Carrie when a popular jock (William Katt) asks her to the prom, only we know the poor girl's nemesis (Nancy Allen) is orchestrating much of the events for the sake of revenge. What very few people know - and unfortunately have to find out - is that Carrie possesses telekinetic abilities, which she unleashes in fury after being mocked and humiliated for the last time. Carrie is one of those characters one can't help but feel sorry for, and any person who's ever been in a similar situation in high school will know her pain. Spacek and Laurie are both incredible in their Oscar nominated performances; the former completely wins you over with her combination of shyness, naivety, and vulnerability. The latter, making a flamboyant return to acting after 15 years away from the business, is purely theatrical, and gets perhaps the most significant refrain in the entire film in the form of 'They're all gonna laugh at you!' Also among the supporting cast are John Travolta, displaying that easy going charisma, Amy Irving (acting opposite her real life mom, Priscilla Pointer), P.J. Soles, Betty Buckley, Sydney Lassick, Stefan Gierasch, Michael Talbott, and Edie McClurg. They're all fun to watch, and De Palma directs with a typical flourish, employing split screen during one critical scene of chaos at the prom. The budget of the film only allowed for a minimum of destruction, yet what makes it onto screen still packs a pretty effective punch; the violence is strong without ever getting too blatantly gory. Some comedy relief is added rather incongruously - the music for the gym detention scenes, the sped up dialogue for the tuxedo shopping sequence - but it doesn't hurt the film at all, and our emotions are manipulated with ease and skill, especially when the haunting music score by the consistently reliable Pino Donaggio is taken into account. The imagery is stunning throughout, including one hell of a creepy little statue, and that now iconic image of Spacek doused in blood. To this date this remains one of the best ever adaptations of a Stephen King work, in this viewer's humble opinion. Followed by a 23 years belated sequel, a made for TV remake, and a pending theatrical remake. Eight out of 10.",8,3,4,10 August 2012
The Woman in Black," A noble effort.
","In one of his first 'grown up' roles, actor Daniel 'Harry Potter' Radcliffe stars as Arthur Kipps, the young, widower father of a four year old son. His sorrow over his wife's death has put his job as a lawyer in jeopardy, and his boss gives him a last chance assignment. He is to go over the affairs of an eccentric, recently deceased lady who lived in an isolated locale known as Eel Marsh. Area residents, in the tradition of many a horror story, treat him with distrust, are very cagey about the tragedies in their past, and are quite superstitious. The only person who really makes friends with him is the solicitous Sam Daily (Ciaran Hinds).In this second adaptation of the 1983 novel by Susan Hill, director James Watkins ('Eden Lake') does his able best to give us a traditional Gothic horror film. It's no surprise that one of the companies behind this production is Britains' famed Hammer Studios, as this kind of thing was their bread and butter for many years. This feature has got TONS of atmosphere - this viewer totally digs that main location, which can only be accessed by a long and winding road that gets flooded at some point every day. Marco Beltrami supplies a good music score, and Watkins & crew do well at creating some real tension.However, there are aspects to this that may simply not work for all members of the audience. The whole scenario seems awfully familiar by this point, at least for those who have seen lots of horror from all time periods. Also, much like the 1981 slasher 'The Prowler' and the 2009 throwback feature 'The House of the Devil', the running time is filled with perhaps a few too many sequences of a character exploring an old dark house. The use of visual effects isn't overwhelming, but Watkins goes the easy route a little too often with the use of jump scares. At least we never get too good a look at our restless, antagonistic spirit.Radcliffe is adequate in the lead, but is overshadowed by the wonderful Hinds and the equally strong Janet McTeer as Daily's wife. It's really Hinds that makes this worth a look.At the very least, the ending is one that some viewers may not see coming. This is competently made, and sufficiently creepy if never all-out frightening.Six out of 10.",6,0,0,31 December 2014
The Silence of the Lambs," A dynamite Hollywood thriller.
","This is deservedly one of the most popular and praised of all the entries in the worn-out 'cop vs. killer' genre, and represents a career high point for its key participants. It's especially noteworthy that it should have swept the five major Oscars for the year of its release, considering that the Academy wouldn't normally award such acclaim to a thriller with often grim and disturbing content - a tribute to how well crafted it is. Also worthy of a mention is the way that this film put the Behavioural Sciences unit of the FBI on the map - that unit devoted to the study of the most deviant 'human' beings among us. Director Jonathan Demme shows a great skill for the genre, and with the assistance of a first rate crew creates some eerily effective suspense. Based on the novel by Thomas Harris, it stars Jodie Foster as an eager beaver young FBI trainee who is sent by her superior (Scott Glenn) to interview an imprisoned murderer, the intelligent, cultured psychopath Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), in the hopes that he can lend his insight into the activities of 'Buffalo Bill' (Ted Levine), a serial killer currently on the loose. Other than a music score by Howard Shore that is a little *too* over the top and manipulative, 'The Silence of the Lambs' hits all the right notes, telling a story in a taut and convincing manner. The subject matter admittedly is not to every taste - especially when one thinks about what Bills' ultimate plan is. The editing (by Craig McKay), production design (by Kristi Zea), and cinematography (by Tak Fujimoto) are exemplary; among the scariest scenes are Clarices' (Foster) search of a storage space, and the climactic action where agent and maniac are finally face to face (and the sequence leading up to that). Of course, the real meat of the story is the unusual relationship between the charismatic Lecter and the determined Clarice, as he demands she divulge personal information in return for his thoughts on the Buffalo Bill case. Lecter is a truly memorable character, from his choice of entertainment to the way that he gleefully toys with those people that he holds in contempt. Hopkins and Foster are both very effective in these parts, although the contributions of the supporting cast absolutely should not go overlooked. Given the way that Lecter dominates the proceedings, it's important to point out just how extremely creepy Bill is; his performance brought character actor Levine to real prominence. Brooke Smith is very good portraying a would-be victim who actually tries to use her wits and fight back in some way. Also appearing are many other familiar faces: Anthony Heald (as the smarmy jerk in charge of the insane asylum), Diane Baker, Kasi Lemmons, Demme regulars Charles Napier and Tracey Walter, his old mentor Roger Corman (as the director of the FBI), Frankie Faison, Dan Butler, Chris Isaak, and Daniel von Bargen. Even at just under two hours long, this is actually pretty taut in terms of pacing; there's no filler at all, just some very potent entertainment. This was preceded by another Harris adaptation, 'Manhunter', in which Brian Cox played Lecter, and would be followed by 'Hannibal' and, after that, 'Red Dragon', another film version of the source novel for 'Manhunter'. Some people tend to prefer 'Manhunter' and consider it superior; this viewer merely prefers to think that they each have their own heavy assets. Nine out of 10.",9,6,15,27 December 2012
Tombstone," Hell's coming with me!
","While not exactly epic in scope - 'Tombstone' does compress the passage of time a fair bit - it does do a fine job of entertaining its audience. This viewer isn't surprised to hear that it plays with the facts - such is the nature of motion pictures - but wasn't exactly expecting a history lesson in the first place. It's extremely well shot and does transport its audience to a different time and place. Everything feels very authentic, from the production design to the costume design. Granted, this gets pretty melodramatic - right after a key death has occurred, our main character is standing outside in an absolute torrent of rain. Subtlety is in short supply. But one thing this movie is not, is boring, and it fills a two hour and 15 minute run time quite thoroughly.A rock solid Kurt Russell leads an absolutely fantastic ensemble. There are LOTS of familiar faces here, although some unfortunately end up with very little to do. Russell plays the legendary lawman Wyatt Earp, who has left that line of work behind - or so he hopes. He retires to the Arizona town of Tombstone with brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) and their wives. Ultimately, fate dictates that Wyatt will NOT be able to 'live and let live'. A very scummy gang of outlaws that call themselves The Cowboys are going to become more than just a nuisance, and Wyatt will be forced to deal with them.It's the engaging and effectively eccentric Val Kilmer, as Wyatts' good friend Doc Holliday, that ends up stealing this show. Kilmer completely immerses himself in this character. Dana Delany as Josephine is an appealing love interest for Wyatt. Elliott, Paxton, and Russell make for a rather believable trio of brothers. Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, and Stephen Lang stand out among the many antagonists. As Doc says of Biehns' Johnny Ringo, he most likely wants revenge for having been born in the first place. Lang as Ike Clanton is such a worthless weasel that you keep hoping to see him get his comeuppance. It's nice to see Western veterans such as Harry Carey Jr. and Buck Taylor among the Tombstone citizens; the real Earps' namesake fifth cousin plays the role of Billy Claiborne. Robert Mitchum, whose son Chris has a tiny role, serves as the narrator.Good action scenes and visceral moments combine with some poignant elements to make for an enjoyable experience.Eight out of 10.",8,1,1,10 December 2014
Bruce Almighty," Hilarious Carrey vehicle.
","Jim Carrey gets an ideal showcase for his comedic and dramatic talents with this endearing fantasy-comedy. He plays Bruce Nolan, a Buffalo reporter obliged to do silly fluff pieces. What he really desires is an anchor position, and when it's given to jerk character Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), that pushes Bruce over the edge. He's already convinced that God is out to get him, and curses God, prompting the Almighty to take the form of Morgan Freeman and appear to Bruce. God decides to grant Bruce all of His divine powers for a week, to give Bruce a chance to see if he can do any better.This is a Hollywood movie, of course, and there is a formula to be found in these things, and Bruces' story is at its core a tale of a guy who ultimately learns a lesson and becomes a better person. Before we get to that point, there are some absolutely priceless bits where a confident Bruce delights in his abilities, first just testing them out and then using them strictly to his own advantage, contriving news events so that he can be on hand for them and become a reporting star. Soon, Bruce learns that there is a tremendous responsibility in being God and that he will have to put selfishness aside. He can't take the job lightly, either, although some of his attempts to solve the problem are a howl (that's such a memorable visual when everything in his apartment is covered in post-it notes). Also, with Bruce interfering so much in the course of events in the universe, there will be consequences that he didn't consider.Freeman, with his effortless charisma, screen presence, and sense of authority, is a natural choice to put a human face on The Almighty. He gives Him a sense of humour and works very well with the energetic Carrey. Jennifer Aniston does a fine job of grounding the material as Bruces' sweet girlfriend. The excellent Philip Baker Hall leads a fun supporting cast in which the always amusing Carell stands out. He, of course, got promoted to star status for the sequel 'Evan Almighty'.This is fairly manipulative, to be sure, but that's also par for the course with this sort of thing. Still, it's likable and has enough good laughs to size up as another solid teaming between Carrey and director Tom Shadyac, who worked with Carrey on 'Ace Ventura Pet Detective' and 'Liar Liar'. Anybody who's a fan of the actors should find this to be quite agreeable overall.Eight out of 10.",8,2,2,30 June 2013
Trainspotting," Choose life. Choose a career.
","The U.K. smash hit 'Trainspotting' was potent and lively entertainment for this viewer, a stylish look at the underground drug scene in Edinburgh, Scotland. It shows both the horror and the humor of this day to day reality for these unfortunate souls. Screenwriter John Hodge (adapting the novel by Irvine Welsh) and director Danny Boyle give us a rich variety of moments throughout: some comical, some serious, some downright uncomfortable, and even some that are wonderfully surreal. The acting is solid all the way down the line, the soundtrack is impeccable (with Iggy Pops' 'Lust for Life' getting us off to a good start), and the pacing always efficient.Ewan McGregor plays Mark Renton, one of a group of junkies who's deeply immersed in this world, but still has the ability to be perceptive, and ponder their sorry condition. He would like to leave the life behind, but the allure of drugs and loyalty to his mates is usually too strong. His best attempts to go straight are most often thwarted in one way or another.Sometimes 'Trainspotting' is a little violent, even hilariously disgusting in one key comic sequence, but it successfully walks a line between its various tones. Boyle draws you in right from the start, giving you a real eyeful of characters and their environs. At no point are the filmmakers ever condoning drugs (which was the mistaken assumption in the North American market), and they never glamorize or overly sentimentalize anything that's going on.McGregor is rock solid in the lead. You like Renton and root for him, and the witty, funny dialogue flows from the lips of him and his castmates with ease. Jonny Lee Miller plays Sean Connery expert 'Sick Boy', Ewen Bremner the affable 'Spud', Kevin McKidd the earnest Tommy, Kelly Macdonald the underage girl Diane, and Peter Mullan the drug dealing Swanney. Robert Carlyle tends to steal the show whenever he's on screen, playing the hot tempered Begbie.This is remarkable entertainment that may get fairly grim but never loses its sense of hope for our protagonist.Eight out of 10.",8,1,1,14 August 2016
Bull Durham," Well acted by the trio of stars.
","'Bull Durham' is one of those engaging sports films that can be enjoyed no matter if one isn't a fan of the sport in question - in this case, baseball. There's all the love in the world for this great American pastime, but there's also some interesting and literate discussions going on all the time in this smart and witty comedy, as well as some memorable characters whom we like and find easy to watch.Kevin Costner plays 'Crash' Davis, a veteran minor league catcher who's hired by the Durham Bulls to act as a mentor to their new pitcher Ebby LaLoosh (Tim Robbins). Ebby is in need of some direction, as he may be truly talented but has ego and discipline problems. At the same time, sexy Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon), the Bulls' loyal groupie, takes an interest in Ebby as she makes a habit of hooking up with one young player every season and helping the man to mature. Naturally, some sparks fly as the two guys both get attracted to Annie.Writer / director Ron Shelton truly knows the territory, having been a minor league baseball player himself, although he doesn't in truth feature a lot of game action. His dialogue is often very funny and often very profane. A lot of humour comes from Annies' manipulation of the naive Ebby, whom she nicknames 'Nuke' and has him do things like wear a garter, thinking this will improve his game. And while the film does get serious at times, it never becomes too maudlin. As was said previously, the attraction comes from watching three intriguing characters and three fine performances. With fine support by Trey Wilson and Robert Wuhl, Costner, Sarandon, and Robbins make the most of the material. There's also some endearing goofiness from the real-life 'Clown Prince of Baseball', a man named Max Patkin. And to top it all off, there are some very sexy scenes in this thing, especially towards the end. All in all, this likable story has a little something for everybody, and is well worth a viewing.Eight out of 10.",8,5,6,14 June 2013
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Appealing rumination on romance from Woody Allen.
","Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) are two sexy young American tourists taking a summer holiday in Spain. They are both drawn (reluctantly, at first, for Vicky) to a lusty, soulful Spanish painter named Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). Things threaten to get even more sticky when Juan Antonios' ex-wife Maria Elena (Oscar-winning Penelope Cruz), an unstable artist, re-enters the picture.'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is a pretty good depiction of different approaches to love, romance, and affairs, as well as functioning as a fantastic travelogue. Obviously, it would be hard to knock any film with so much aesthetic value and attractive women as this picture has going for it. Writer / director Woody Allen makes sure to keep characters and situations reasonably realistic, giving his story a good foundation. Of course, it does get a real shot in the arm in the second half with Cruz' entrance into the picture. Her fiery performance is quite intoxicating.But the whole cast is fine. Juan Antonio may be a passionate sort of guy, but he also has no desire to be a home-wrecker given that Vicky is already engaged to another man (Chris Messina). Patricia Clarkson and Kevin Dunn round out a main cast in this yarn of people struggling to find their version of happiness.Accompanied by a lovely musical soundtrack, 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' may not be on the same level as Allen's weightiest works, but it's far from being mere fluff. It's actually a pretty intelligent script backed up by very attractive settings.This viewers' only annoyance was with the ever-present, and largely unnecessary, voice-over narration.Seven out of 10.",7,0,0,4 August 2019
The Deer Hunter," Hits its audience hard.
","An epic film about both friendship, and the tragic effects that stressful experiences can have on the mind, 'The Deer Hunter' would have to be considered the true magnum opus of the late director Michael Ciminos' career. It brilliantly captures the feel of a small working-class town (Clairton) in Pennsylvania, and the camaraderie among a tight-knit group of buddies.It's divided into three parts: their lives before, during, and after their tours of duty in Vietnam. It's a very long but engrossing picture that takes characters and viewers alike on a very emotional journey. It's sensitive, beautifully acted, and extremely well shot in widescreen by Vilmos Zsigmond.Robert De Niro (Michael), John Cazale (Stan), John Savage (Steven), Christopher Walken (Nick), George Dzundza (John), and Chuck Aspegren (Axel) are the friends in question, and at no time do they not feel like real people. Real, flawed, but compelling people whom you really come to love by the end of the picture. Steven and Nick have definitely been shattered by their time in 'Nam, leading to some heartbreaking moments. Indeed, Walken does some of the finest acting of his career, and his Supporting Actor Oscar win was merited. Meryl Streep also shines as Nicks' girlfriend, distraught when for a period of time he seems to disappear into thin air.As has been said, this is not really a film *about* the Vietnam War, and one shouldn't let their political inclinations affect the way they view what is ultimately an interesting character study. One review was correct in saying that these could have been any small-town characters struggling to get by during any time of war.Walken and Savage contribute the standout turns, but this is also a nice showcase for character players like Dzundza, Rutanya Alda (as Stevens' bride), Shirley Stoler (as his mom), and Joe Grifasi. Sadly, poor Cazale was dying of cancer during production and he passed away before he could even see the finished film. Roy Scheider had originally been cast as Michael, but walked off the film after major creative differences. Still contractually bound to Universal, this is why he ended up having to do 'Jaws 2'.Sometimes intense, and sometimes harrowing, this may demand a fair amount of your time, but the rewards are substantial.Nine out of 10.",9,2,4,12 August 2018
Live Free or Die Hard," One good thing about it: it makes me want to crank some CCR.
","The 'Die Hard' franchise gets reinvented for the technology-driven 21st century in this long but somewhat diverting action picture. Bruce Willis is in fine form as terminally tough and cranky NYC senior detective John McClane. He ends up having yet another of his trademark REALLY bad days when he agrees to do a favour for the FBI. His task is to pick up a hacker named Matthew Farrell (Justin Long), and bring him to the authorities in DC. What McClane doesn't know is that Farrell was exploited by psychotic techies, led by cyber terrorist mastermind Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), who want to shut down the whole country.The formula was already beginning to wear thin by this point. While it is fun to see Willis do his wisecracking, tougher than thou routine, the material isn't as entertaining (as topical as it may be). Part of the problem here is that the bad guys sort of lack personality. Most of them, save maybe for Thomas' henchwoman / girlfriend Mai (the sexy Maggie Q) are just standard issue goons. As directed by Len Wiseman, the movie is never, ever boring - I give it credit for hitting the ground running - but it ends up being pretty damn stupid. In these movies, we always expect McClane to turn into some sort of superman who handles the problems almost single handedly, but that aspect gets pushed to another level here, with an absurdly over the top finale. 'Live Free or Die Hard' is slickly made, as far as it goes, but feels more generic than the previous entries.Long is good as the kind of character who the viewer might dislike at first: he's annoying, but after a while, he begins to 'grow a pair', as they say, and proves himself worthy. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fairly spunky as the now-grown Lucy McClane. The consistently solid Cliff Curtis does his best as a no nonsense federal agent. Olyphant is usually money in the bank, but his villain is rather boring and unmemorable. Filmmaker Kevin Smith is somewhat amusing in the role of a very stereotypical loser / master hacker.This kills 129 minutes in entertaining enough fashion, but is more for the undemanding action fan than truly discerning viewers.Six out of 10.",6,2,3,12 January 2016
Lucy," Silly, but not boring.
","Writer / director Luc Besson is determined here to give us superhero-styled escapism stemming from some provocative ideas. The theme is that human beings really only use about 10% of their brains' full potential. So what if someone were able to tap into the other 90%? What would that person be able to do? What would they be like?Scarlett Johansson plays the title role, an ordinary average gal roped into an untenable situation by a guy she barely knows: deliver a mysterious briefcase to a Korean mobster named Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi). The contents consist of a synthetic drug that supposedly allows users to tap into that aforementioned 90%. It's inserted into her system, and she becomes a rapidly evolving super-human who turns to an eminent professor (Morgan Freeman) and a badass cop (Amr Waked) for help.Ultimately, it's pure fantasy & fiction, and this viewer certainly wasn't expecting anything resembling a documentary. It's very fast paced (clocking in at a mere hour and a half), action-packed, over the top, and ridiculous as all-get-out. Nevertheless, it's fairly amusing on that level, with some violence & gore, and a plethora of digital effects work.Scarlett is easy to watch, as always, and her performance can be monotonous at times, but generally it's entertaining. Freeman again projects effortless quiet authority as the films' requisite brain science expert. Choi is a hoot as the unrelenting villain, and Waked is good as he injects a little dose of humanity into the proceedings.All in all, this is something of a hoot, one that doesn't require the prospective viewer to work their own brains that hard.Six out of 10.",6,0,1,23 February 2019
The Producers," Played to perfection by its cast.
","Mel Brooks's irresistible zany style was already in full bloom for this theatrical directing debut, a gleeful concoction about a hard luck Broadway producer, Max Bialystock (multiple Tony award winner Zero Mostel) who cons old ladies out of their money by agreeing to play games with them. Into his life comes a meek accountant, Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) who's supposed to go over the producers' books. Leo casually ventures the idea that one could make a lot of money selling well over 100% of a play which would be sure to flop. So the two of them think that they've found their surefire flop in 'Springtime for Hitler', an invention by disgruntled ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars). Of course, their plan goes seriously awry when the play is tweaked by its no-talent director, Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewett) and then performed for laughs by hammy star 'L.S.D.' (Dick Shawn), and the audience ends up loving it!This viewer personally didn't find the movie to always be terribly funny but there are most certainly very good moments throughout. The cast is so utterly enthusiastic that they do win you over. Mostel and Wilder are a great comedy team, especially in their introductory scenes; Leo is afraid of having Max jump on him and, much like Linus from the Peanuts comic strip, is attached to a blue blanket that he carries around with him! Mostel is a true force of nature as the slimy Max, while Wilder, who of course would go on to do other great things for Brooks, showed here his unmatched ability to completely flip out in a comic way. The other actors are fun, too; Mars is a riot as the unhinged Franz, especially towards the end when he, Leo, and Max make their last ditch effort to salvage their scheme. Lee Meredith is smoking hot as Ulla, the Swedish bombshell hired as a secretary who thinks that 'going to work' means go go dancing. Viewers will also delight in the appearances by Renee Taylor (as Eva Braun), William Hickey as the drunk, and Barney Martin as Goring.The songs, not surprisingly, are catchy, with L.S.D.'s audition performance a standout. Brooks fans will know that his voice can be heard dubbed into the 'Springtime for Hitler' number.This movie didn't do so well at first but amazingly found a supporter in comedy star Peter Sellers, and his endorsement would motivate people to revisit it and give it a fresh evaluation. 46 years later, it's now also extremely well known for inspiring a very successful Broadway musical, itself filmed in 2005.It's must viewing for all those eager to see the beginnings of Brooks's film career, a couple of years before he hit his biggest peak with his spoofs 'Blazing Saddles' and 'Young Frankenstein'.Seven out of 10.",7,0,1,21 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," This viewer is in neither the 'love it' nor the 'loathe it' camp.
","Basically adequate reboot of this legendary film series offers up a reasonably entertaining story, but one without much resonance. The special effects often tend to take over, and there's not really that much threat from the villains on hand. While it is a treat to see veterans of the franchise return to their beloved roles, they mostly take a back seat to the new characters. Yes, the yarn concocted here by director J.J. Abrams and original series screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan feels awfully familiar at times; there's no denying that. 'The Force Awakens' also tends to get a little overly precious, as it concerns the new droid character BB-8.30 years after the Rebels helped to eliminate the Empire and destroy their second Death Star, a new evil entity has emerged to take the Empires' place. They're the 'First Order', and one of their number is a moody young Jedi named Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Not helping matters is the fact that original hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has disappeared at this time when he's needed the most. The Rebels are now re-christened The Resistance, and Leia, now a general with this organization, seeks to find her missing brother. Drawn into the fray are Finn (John Boyega of 'Attack the Block'), a former Stormtrooper who experienced a change of heart, and Rey (Daisy Ridley), a desert scavenger.'The Force Awakens' yields adequate entertainment, and attempts to deliver some genuine emotion, but it fails to be completely engaging. It's got a breathless pace to it, and lots of action. The cast features a number of familiar faces, but they've been better utilized in other things. Harrison Fords' Han Solo, who's gone back to his mercenary ways, gets the lions' share of screen time compared to his fellow alumni of Episodes IV to VI. He, at least, is in fine form. But Kylo Ren is an underwhelming villain, as is the all-powerful figure Snoke from whom he takes his orders. He's a pipsqueak compared to Darth Vader. It's also a real shame to have the legendary Max von Sydow on hand in the opening minutes, in such a regrettably brief cameo appearance. Fortunately, Boyega and Ridley are appealing heroes and anchor this stage of the saga pretty well. And the expected abundance of CGI is complemented by a respectable amount of practical effects.Overall, a well intentioned but uninspired continuation of Episodes I to VI.Six out of 10.",6,11,17,4 May 2016
Final Destination," Death sure likes to keep busy...
","'X-Files' veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong do well with this better than average, interesting horror movie. It's not wholly original - a little known movie titled 'Sole Survivor' predates it by about 17 years, and its succession of elaborate murder set pieces calls to mind the 'Omen' series - but it's slick and entertaining. Its premise hinges on the idea that Death has a 'design'; people can interfere with that design but are merely delaying the inevitable. Devon Sawa stars as Alex Browning, about to fly to Paris with his high school French class, only to experience a horrific vision of the airplane exploding. He and several others get off the airplane, which does indeed explode. However, the survivors won't have long to celebrate their good fortune as Death intends to claim them no matter what. Alex figures out the order in which they will perish and starts doing everything he can to intervene. The story becomes rather standard stuff as we watch our cast of characters get knocked off one at a time, and the brutality visited upon this unfortunate bunch is often extremely amusing, whether it involves stabbing, fire, decapitation, or being mowed down by a bus. Things get off to a moody, atmospheric, and ominous start with some well done opening credits and the viewer does get a sense of impending doom right away. One of the best touches is turning John Denver's song 'Rocky Mountain High' (the late singer having perished in a plane crash himself) into a harbinger of death. The material is sincerely played by its cast, also including Ali Larter ('Heroes'), Kerr Smith ('Dawson's Creek'), Seann William 'Stifler' Scott ('Goon'), Chad Donella ('Disturbing Behavior'), Daniel Roebuck ('Halloween II' '09), Brendan Fehr ('The Forsaken'), etc. The sequence with charismatic genre veteran Tony Todd as enigmatic mortician Mr. Bludworth is far and away the best, with Todd making the most of his brief screen time. Pacing is good, the special effects mostly convincing, and all in all the movie makes for a good diversion, although it eventually gets bogged down in the whole idea of just what the order of death should be, and the ending is just not terribly satisfactory. Still, filmmakers have certainly gotten a lot of mileage out of the concept here, with three sequels and one prequel having followed this initial entry. This is fun enough material with a lot of shocks, a bit of self-referential flavour to the writing (characters are named after notable filmmakers and actors of the 1920's, 30's, and 40's), and a fair amount of style.

The Purge," Entertaining, but nothing special.
","The filmmakers here, led by writer / director James DeMonaco, get your attention with an effective 'hook' but then don't develop things as interestingly as one might hope. It's too bad, because as others have said, the material *did* have potential, but ultimately this is a Hollywood product where nuance is shoved aside in favour of a familiar siege / home invasion type scenario. That's not to say that the film is incompetently made - it's slick and watchable, with some decent suspense and jump moments, as well as a bit of gore - but the viewer will likely end up thinking that they've seen all this before.Ethan Hawke, who'd starred in the 'Assault on Precinct 13' remake that DeMonaco had written, is front and centre here as James Sandin, a salesman for a security system company. He and his family live in a future year (2022, to be exact) where the government thinks it's figured out how to channel the aggressive instincts of its citizens - allow them a 12 hour period once every year, dubbed a 'purge', where all crime is permitted and people can release all of their pent up hostility. Sandin and his loved ones get caught up in an untenable situation when his son Charlie (Max Burkholder) gives sanctuary to a wounded stranger (Edwin Hodge), whose tormentors, led by a well spoken young man (Rhys Wakefield) soon come calling.What's going to lose some members of the audience is the fact that, as in so many films of this kind, the characters act in order to serve the purpose of the story rather than act sensibly. Still, it does get ones' bloodlust boiling; people may end up wishing that this dumb family bites it as violently as their enemies do. By the end, it's hard not to be yelling at the screen.The actors do what they can with the script and dialogue. Co-starring are the always watchable Lena Headey as the wife / mother, Adelaide Kane as the bratty, sullen daughter, Arija Bareikis as annoying neighbour Grace, and veteran Chris Mulkey as area local Mr. Halverson. The standout is clearly Australian actor Wakefield, who's chillingly civil as the leader of the gang.This film does kill time fairly well but it's inevitably going to let some viewers down. Maybe things will get a little more intriguing in the inevitable sequel.Six out of 10.",6,3,6,19 January 2014
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
","In the slasher sub genre, one that's particularly crowded with all sorts of efforts, studio and independent productions alike, of high and low budgets, Wes Craven's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' still reigns supreme as one of the more imaginative of the entire bunch. Nightmares have been fodder for many horror films over the years, but here they're particularly insidious and memorable. The film basically turned its producing studio, New Line Cinema, into a major player, gave a fresh breath of life into a sub genre that had grown stale, boosted the career of Craven, turned its dream haunting, scarred bogeyman Freddy Krueger into a pop culture icon (hat, red & green striped sweater, designer glove and all), and made co-star Robert Englund (as Krueger) a bona fide genre star. The impact it's made in 31 years is simply undeniable.The story deals with Krueger, a depraved murderer of children, who was executed by a vengeful vigilante mob, and who now lives on in the nightmares of the mob members' children. Resourceful, feisty young Nancy (appealing Heather Langenkamp) realizes it's up to her to combat Freddy - on his own terms - before he can continue to claim victims, while her peers and the adults around her think she's simply going insane.Many ingenious ideas here when it comes to the world of nightmares, and as this thing plays out it's not always clear where the nightmare ends and reality begins. The boiler room is one hell of a wonderful, atmospheric, and sinister location, and that glove, with knives attached to the fingers, really is a thing of macabre beauty. The movie is fantastically gory, yet other special effects are often just as impressive; there is an undeniable appeal in seeing effects done when the digital revolution was still years away and things were accomplished practically. Jacques Haitkins' cinematography is often wonderfully moody, and Charles Bernstein contributes what has to be one of the most catchy and haunting scores of the genre, up to and including that jump rope ditty.The cast runs a little hot and cold as some of the performances aren't all that great, but it's still a decent assemblage of talent, from veterans John Saxon and Ronee Blakley, to Langenkamp, Amanda Wyss, Jsu Garcia, and Johnny Depp (in his feature debut) as the imperiled kids to character players like Charles Fleischer, Lin Shaye, and Joe Unger. Langenkamps' Nancy is a heroine for whom you do want to root, and Englund, although it hardly needs to be said, delivers a deliciously evil performance; given how silly a character Freddy eventually became, it's nice to see him in the days when he was still plenty scary.All in all, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is one of the quintessential films of its genre that's pretty much required viewing for newcomers.Nine out of 10.",9,0,0,21 October 2012
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," 'Dude, strange things are afoot at the Circle K.'
","It's a testament to the entertainment value of this incredibly engaging time capsule movie that it continues to be very funny over 20 years later. It's a time travel comedy with an inventive gimmick: the title characters, two of the most definitive slacker dude archetypes in the business, along with Sean Penn's Spicoli from 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', seem destined to flunk their history course, but thanks to the intervention of Rufus (legendary comedian George Carlin), they get some much needed help: a phone booth that allows them to access places and times in history, and collect a wide assortment of history making individuals. This allows for some truly side splitting fish out of water material. Stars Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are extremely well cast and work well together as the inseparable Ted 'Theodore' Logan and Bill S. Preston, Esquire, who are determined to see their rock band Wyld Stallyns become a reality - with or without Eddie Van Halen. The movie is breezy, snappy stuff with some utterly hilarious moments, with the memorable Terry Camilleri as Napoleon completely stealing the show with his hammy performance - whether he's pitching a fit at a bowling alley, hogging the slides at a water slide park (appropriately named Waterloo), or greedily gulping down ice cream. The rest of the actors playing the historical figures are all funny, too, including Dan Shor as Billy the Kid, Tony Steedman as Socrates, Rod Loomis as Sigmund Freud, Jane Wiedlin (of rock band The Go-Gos) as Joan of Arc, Al Leong as Genghis Khan, Clifford David as Beethoven, and Robert V. Barron as a smiling Abraham Lincoln. Whether it's Billy and Socrates trying to pick up girls, Freud trying to analyze a detective interviewing him, Joan of Arc taking over an aerobics class, or Genghis Khan raising Hell in a sporting goods store, the antics in the final third get pretty hysterical. Hal Landon, Jr., as Ted's ticked off dad and Bernie Casey as teacher Mr. Ryan are good in support; 80's babe Diane Franklin has a small role as one of the princesses, screenwriters Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon have cameos as the ultra annoying waiters, and real life music industry celebrities Clarence Clemons of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, Martha Davis of The Motels, and Fee Waybill of The Tubes make cameo appearances as well. And how many of us guys would have been happy to have a gal like Missy...I mean Mom...in our house? The soundtrack is pretty cool, and 22 years later, this movie is overall just too upbeat, likably silly, and clever to resist at all. Followed by the sequel 'Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey' two years later, and two short lived TV series, one live action and one animated. Eight out of 10.",8,0,0,15 December 2011
The Matrix," Which will it be, the red pill or the blue pill?
","'The Matrix' is a trend-setting, visually dazzling sci-fi / action picture that offers up some provocative ideas and entertaining concepts. Its various scenes of human acrobatics and bullet-dodging gimmickry immediately became iconic, lending themselves to parody as well as to imitation. Granted, there IS a lot of mumbo-jumbo in this script, and the film does go on a little too long, but it's hard to deny the amusement level of such colourful escapism.Keanu Reeves is front and centre as Thomas Anderson, alias 'Neo', a software designer by day and computer hacker by night. Then he is informed by characters led by the charismatic Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) that the world in which he lives is not reality. It is actually an illusion created by an omnipotent artificial intelligence. Morpheus believes that Neo is 'The One', the person who will be the ultimate weapon for good in the war waged against this nefarious A.I. Pursuing our heroes are various relentless Agents, in particular the deadpan Smith (Hugo Weaving).'The Matrix' is generally good fun, as it delivers a number of nicely executed set pieces. The martial arts fights, choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, are highlights, but there is also one effective chase sequence near the end. John Gaeta supervised the visual FX, which are memorable all the way to the end.The cast is fine - Joe Pantoliano (co-star of The Wachowski siblings' breakthrough film, 'Bound'), Carrie-Anne Moss, Marcus Chong, Gloria Foster, Matt Doran, Anthony Ray Parker, etc. Keanu does alright as the hero who becomes more badass as the story plays out, steadily awakening to this new reality facing him. Fishburne again displays a solid screen presence, delivering exposition in such a way that one can't help but pay attention. Moss is an engaging heroine, and her athleticism in various action sequences is quite impressive. Weaving is a simply great villain.Well produced, well directed, and pounding ahead to a soundtrack including Rob Zombie, Prodigy, and Marilyn Manson, among others; this spawned a franchise that as of this writing is about to be revived.Seven out of 10.",7,0,0,22 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Force will be with you...always.
","There's hardly anything this reviewer can say that hasn't already been said, and said better, numerous times before, about this milestone in cinema and the popular culture. The story, of a simple farm boy from an isolated desert planet meeting his destiny as one of the brave souls fighting an evil intergalactic organization, is wonderful fantasy in a science-fiction setting.The mythology it creates ensures its staying power, as well as the many endearing and entertaining characters we meet along the way. There's the reckless, macho mercenary Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who learns something about doing things for others rather than just himself, the wizened old warrior Ben / Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) who instructs our young hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on the ways of the 'Force', the young Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) determined to right the wrongs being perpetrated in this universe, the loyal anthropoid spaceship co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), the menacing bad ass that is the black garbed Darth Vader (David Prowse / voice of James Earl Jones), and the odd couple robots R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) who provide us with a healthy amount of comedy relief.The movie is cast to perfection, with old pros like Peter Cushing and Mr. Guinness supporting the talented up and comers Hamill, Ford, and Fisher. A team of technical wizards, who pioneered some ingenious special effects, bring us from one visually astounding environment to another, from the desert wastes of Tatooine to the stark efficiency of the armoured space station The Death Star. John Williams, the man behind some of the most instantly recognizable soundtracks of all time, supplies the iconic score here that lets us know, right from the first moments of the film, that we're in for a good time.Of course, those of us who have become extremely familiar with the film over time would give anything to once again be experiencing it for the first time, which is why it's a joy to see it with younger viewers as they are introduced to its sense of wonder. It's equal parts thrilling, suspenseful, and humorous, and gives us an effective final dogfight in space equivalent to that of an old time war movie.Just speaking personally, this has great resonance for me as it was one of those treasured films of my youth and one had better believe that I was a proud owner of a number of the toys. I always looked forward to a viewing and even as an adult when I know what to expect, the fun factor of the thing still comes through strong.This is definitely one of those films that cinema lovers ought to see at least once in their lifetime.Nine out of 10.",9,0,0,19 July 2012
Cube," Amazingly intense and ingenious thriller.
","Co-writer Vincenzo Natali's movie is one of those that achieves that beautiful combination of being both intelligent and visceral. Natali maintains an uneasy tension the entire time as we follow a limited number of characters through an insane situation. These are strangers that have been gathered for some unknown purpose in a structure that, it turns out, is comprised of a seemingly never ending series of gloomy rooms, some of which come equipped with truly sadistic booby traps. Unfortunately, the characters realize how hard it will be to rely on each other as they struggle to think their way through the maze. Not only does this movie provide some grim and gruesome thrills (and work as something of a forerunner to the 'Saw' franchise), but it's an all too believable study of the dark side of human nature, the 'masks' that people can wear, and the danger of ignorance when people don't bother to ask questions. Natali and co-screenwriters Andre Bijelic and Graeme Manson keep things nicely ambiguous as to why and how this group of people came to be there, never bothering to answer very many questions themselves. They also do a fine, fine job of keeping things mostly unpredictable, not killing off certain characters when we think they will, and using both script and performance to have the audience eventually realize that we had some of the characters wrong. There are also delicious jolts along the way in terms of gore, as one character is diced right at the beginning, and another gets their face melted right down. The design of the movie is absolutely incredible, with the various rooms enhanced by various lighting schemes; the wonderful production design is by Jasna Stefanovic, the art direction by Diana Magnus, and the cinematography by Derek Rogers. The music by Mark Korven is effectively sinister without ever becoming too intrusive. The acting is solid, with Nicole de Boer playing Leaven, the math expert who's the most likable of them all, the commanding Maurice Dean Wint as Quentin, David Hewlett (who also worked with Natali on 'Splice') as the cagey, cynical Worth, Nicky Guadagni as the nervous Holloway, Andrew Miller as idiot savant Kazan, Wayne Robson as a former jailbird, Rennes, now trapped in another kind of prison, and the briefly seen Julian Richings as Alderson. Horror and thriller fans tired of movies with the same old, same old types of stories are advised to check out the creepy 'Cube', a movie that holds interest right up until its decidedly grim resolution.

Jackie Brown," Pam is STILL the Queen!
","One of Quentin Tarantino's more mature outings, this is an engaging adaptation of the novel 'Rum Punch' by Elmore Leonard. The filmmaker shows a typically masterful way of telling a story, except that, because he's working from someone else's source material, there's less self-indulgence on his part. He assembled one hell of an impressive cast here, and as usual his choice of music is pretty damn eclectic. 'Jackie Brown' is an awfully long, seemingly unwieldy film at approximately two hours and 35 minutes, but it's always hip, and funny, and entertaining.Blaxploitation goddess Pam Grier got a long overdue comeback vehicle here, playing the title role. Jackie is an ageing flight attendant who also couriers money for gun running lowlife Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson). Soon, she's caught in the act, and does an amazing job of manipulating both the detectives (Michael Bowen, Michael Keaton) on her case and Robbie himself, all in the name of keeping herself out of jail and on the job.Pam is a treat to watch, playing this very smart and very savvy person whom you just can't help but like. Also getting one of his best roles in ages is Robert Forster, as the lovestruck bail bondsman Max Cherry who's intrigued by her situation. The scenes with Pam and Forster are among the best in the film. Jackson is a lot of fun as the flamboyant criminal. The excellent ensemble extends to Robert De Niro, as Ordell's not too bright associate Louis, and Bridget Fonda, as the conniving surfer girl Melanie. Chris Tucker, LisaGay Hamilton, Tommy 'Tiny' Lister, Hattie Winston, and Aimee Graham co-star; it's especially delicious seeing Sid Haig, Pam's long ago co-star in exploitation features of the 1970s, cast as a judge.You know you're in for some good times when the opening credits are accompanied by Bobby Womack's 'Across 110th Street'. The cinematography by Guillermo Navarro and editing by Sally Menke are first rate. Although the pace is rather deliberate, things get more interesting towards the end as Tarantino shows climactic events occurring from a few different perspectives.Although Tarantino films often tend to get quite violent in an operatic sort of way, the violence here is more restrained, which may make 'Jackie Brown' more accessible to people who ordinarily might find the directors' work somewhat off putting.This is a rock solid picture, one that's well worth seeing.Eight out of 10.",8,1,2,21 May 2015
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," 'What, behind the rabbit?'
","The second feature film vehicle for the legendary Monty Python comedy troupe wasn't always terribly funny for this viewer, but it has enough memorably hilarious lines and moments to make it very pleasant viewing. The boys are in their element here, knowing full well that often the best 'no-brainer' laughs actually require a fair amount of intelligence. Along the way there are many verbal and visual gags, some of which go on a bit long. But there's always another good laugh in store. The movie is deliberately episodic, giving each main character a chance in the spotlight, and allowing each troupe member to show off his comedic chops. There are some delicious jokes that remind you that you're watching a movie, including the time honoured tradition of breaking the fourth wall. There are hysterically over the top gore gags, animated interludes, and the occasional brief musical bit.The story has King Arthur (Graham Chapman) recruiting good men to be part of the court of Camelot, among them Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin), Sir Lancelot the Brave (John Cleese), and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot (Eric Idle). God then tasks Arthur and his merry band with retrieving the Holy Grail, causing them to have many misadventures as they deal with countless quirky individuals, such as the Knights Who Say NI!Among the personal favourite moments for this viewer were the goofy and gruesome fight with the Black Knight (Cleese), the instances of taunting from French soldiers ('Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!'), the episode with the fair maidens of Castle Anthrax, and of course the show stopping confrontation with one of the most deadly beasts known to man. Adding to the entertainment factor is the use of music, which is majestic rather than comical.The ending to this is uproarious, and does send the audience away with a smile. All in all, 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' is engaging stuff that is preferable to some of the comedies of the modern era.Seven out of 10.",7,1,2,3 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The standout film in the series so far.
","Story author and executive producer George Lucas truly managed to outdo himself when it came to making a sequel to his landmark 1977 'Star Wars' film. It combines an appreciably high level of character development with some genuinely exciting and riveting scenes, and introduced the well loved character of diminutive Jedi master Yoda into the formula. Villainous Darth Vader is brought to the forefront rather than being a lackey to somebody else. The relationship between cocky spaceship pilot Han Solo and serious minded rebel leader Princess Leia evolves to where romance can finally take place. And Luke Skywalker becomes more than just the naive and idealistic farm boy, letting his emotions get the better of him.With the directing chores being handed over to Irvin Kershner ('A Fine Madness', 'Up the Sandbox', 'Eyes of Laura Mars'), 'The Empire Strikes Back' marks a maturation in terms of story quality, as well as a willingness to go to some dark places. After all, as it begins, it sees its hero in serious jeopardy. It's never treated as a given that Good will prevail. The screenplay is credited to Leigh Brackett ('The Big Sleep', 'Rio Bravo', 'El Dorado') and Lawrence Kasdan ('Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Body Heat', 'The Big Chill'), and stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher make the most of the material. The endearing Yoda is one of those examples of a puppet who truly does become a character rather than just a gimmick. The film is a little short on cool aliens, but it does feature a Yeti-like monster called a Wampa, and an enormous slug used in a funny 'worm in the apple' sort of gag. The spectacle is fantastic, but it never overwhelms the story. The early battle scene on the ice fields of the planet Hoth is incredibly well executed, and the final lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader (who of course has a revelation in store for the youngster) offers one thrill after another.The special effects are as impressive as ever, and it would be difficult to hear that memorable John Williams score and not get into the spirit of the thing. You truly care about the characters and want to see what will happen with them. And it delivers an ending that perfectly captures a sense of uncertainty and a degree of despair, setting up the problems to be solved in the next film.This is definitely a milestone blockbuster that holds up well 33 years later.10 out of 10.",10,0,0,1 July 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Judge for yourself.
","'The Cabin in the Woods' looks to be another of those divisive genre entries that either pleases the viewer or annoys them. It's really not as clever as its filmmakers would seem to think, but it does offer a fresh spin on standard horror formulas for people desperate for something different.To reveal too much would be a mistake; it's best that people go in not knowing a lot. What this review will state is that on the surface this would appear to be an 'Evil Dead' type of film about five young people journeying to the title location and having to deal with sadistic zombies. But things aren't as they appear. Other eyes are watching as the scenario plays out.The horror doesn't work as well as one might like due to the nature of the script, written by producer Joss Whedon (creator of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer') and director Drew Goddard. Still, some genre fans may be pleased to note the level of brutality on display. There ends up being a ton of special effects and spectacle. The ultimate revelation of why this is all necessary is really rather lame, but the audience may still enjoy being taken for the ride and appreciate the way that the story resolves itself.The acting from all concerned is solid, with old pro Richard Jenkins a standout. The five main roles are clich√©s - including a jock, a stoner, and a virgin - but as we will see the selection of such archetypes is quite deliberate. Fans will enjoy seeing the cameo appearance by a beloved genre superstar.Some genre fans may feel that this film is condescending to them and dislike what seems to be hubris on the part of the filmmakers in terms of their cleverness. Others will like seeing what amounts to an interesting deconstruction of genre staples. It's best left to the individual viewer as to how well this works or not.Seven out of 10.",7,0,2,9 April 2013
Moon," Sci-fi with humour and heart.
","It's a year of the future in which mankind actually draws an energy source from the moon. Currently they have a person stationed alone on the lunar surface: astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell). His companion is a robotic intelligence named 'Gerty', voiced by Kevin Spacey. He tries his best to keep his sanity, while his three year tour is just about over. One day, a vehicular accident leads Sam to make some stunning discoveries. He's not really so alone.'Moon' marks an interesting, and emotionally involving, filmmaking effort for story author / director Duncan Jones (the son of music legend David Bowie), screenwriter Nathan Parker, and others. It tells a small scale story, and a rather intimate one, with Rockwell often the only human performer seen on screen. It's quiet, and thoughtful; it doesn't indulge in action set pieces or anything to do with aliens. It deals with issues of paranoia, human identity, loneliness, and an individuals' right to exist. Overall, it's quite satisfying, with top notch visuals functioning as icing on the cake. The music score by Clint Mansell is quite wonderful. Without spoiling too much, this viewer will say that he greatly appreciated the various twists in the plot.Rockwell remains a very watchable and valuable actor, and he is one of the greatest assets that this film can boast. If you're going to have your story basically focus on one person, you need an actor who can fully engage the audiences' sympathies, and Rockwell succeeds admirably.If you're a sci-fi fan, and want to see something that doesn't involve alien invasions or space battles or the like, this one comes highly recommended.Eight out of 10.",8,0,1,10 September 2017
Donnie Darko," Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
","Writer / director Richard Kelly has created here what can only be described as an instant cult favourite type of film, one that may drive some viewers crazy, while endlessly fascinating others. What it's like is a puzzle, a puzzle made of quirky, offbeat pieces, some of them with a very high degree of unreality. This viewer is not quite sure WHAT to make of it, but believes that, no doubt, it will be the kind of film that will prove to be continuously mesmerizing on repeat viewings, with elements that he may not have picked up on the first time. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the title character, a moody, troubled high school student who starts experiencing hallucinations. Chief among them is a demonic 'rabbit' named Frank (James Duval) who informs Donnie that the world will be coming to an end within a month. Taking place in 1988, with the Dukakis / Bush presidency race serving as a backdrop, this goes to great lengths to contrast the many aspects of Donnies' life. What is real? What's illusion? Certainly some viewers will have an incredible time examining all of the details and clues. Hell, even when this film is over, it's not necessarily providing a cut and dried explanation for everything. Kelly utilizes every filmmaking trick at his disposal, and does very well at keeping things suitably enigmatic. He also gets strong performances out of his interestingly chosen cast: Jena Malone as Donnies' new girlfriend, Drew Barrymore (also the executive producer), Beth Grant, and Noah Wyle as teachers, Daveigh Chase and Gyllenhaals' real-life sister Maggie as Donnies' siblings, Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell as his parents, Katharine Ross as his psychiatrist, Patrick Swayze as a self-help guru, and Seth Rogen (in his film debut) as a thuggish schoolmate. The use of soundtrack music is eclectic, and the visual effects are a collective knockout. As a horror fan this viewer had to also enjoy a viewing of 'The Evil Dead' within the film as a story detail. All of this is nothing if not ambitious, slowly and steadily working its way towards its conclusion, incorporating ideas such as time travel into its provocative mix. It may not be for all tastes, but it's bound to get people talking, which of course isn't exactly a bad thing. All in all, it's well worth a look for adventurous film lovers.

Shark Tale," Fun for both kids and adults.
","This CG animated feature can't boast a truly great story, but it does go far enough on the abilities of its very well chosen cast. It stars Will Smith as the voice of Oscar, a tongue scrubber at a 'whale wash' in an undersea kingdom. Oscar talks big and dreams big, and is tired of being a 'nobody'. So when one of the sons of great white godfather Don Lino (voice of Robert De Niro) perishes, Oscar takes credit for killing the shark, and becomes the toast of the town. He also becomes friends with Lenny (voice of Jack Black), Don Linos' wimpy, vegetarian son.'Shark Tale' is good entertainment overall, with plenty of amusing character design, and a respectable amount of energy. The filmmakers do come up with a lot of chuckle-inducing jokes, both verbal and visual. But the real hook is in hearing various actors play animated sharks as mobsters. On one level, the movie is okay viewing for younger viewers (although it might be somewhat intense for the youngest of them), and on another level, it's savvy comedy for grownups, with references to well known mob movies of the past.Smith is a real live wire as the fast talking Oscar, De Niro is a pleasure, and Renee Zellweger is appealing as Angie, Oscars' co-worker who's really in love with him. Angelina Jolie is just right as the self-serving, seductive fish who only attaches herself to Oscar when she thinks he's going places. Various other familiar voices here, too: Peter Falk, Michael Imperioli, Vincent Pastore, and Ziggy Marley and Doug E. Doug as a pair of Rastafarian jellyfish. It's a particular treat to hear the master filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who lends his voice to Sykes, a frequently flustered puffer fish.The hip, catchy soundtrack also helps to make this an agreeable 90 minute long outing.Seven out of 10.",7,1,1,21 December 2016
Jurassic Park," Everything a Hollywood thrill ride ought to be.
","Co-scripted by Michael Crichton from his own best-seller, 'Jurassic Park' is a great deal of fun, offering action, suspense, scares, amusing performances, and some of the most utterly convincing special effects that you'll see in a film of this type.Billionaire John Hammond (a delightful Richard Attenborough) has created an island theme park populated with living dinosaurs that he's had cloned from ancient dinosaur DNA. When issues as to the safety of the park arise, he hires renowned paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to inspect the place and hopefully give it their seal of approval. He's so confident of his security measures that he even lets his target audience, in the form of his grandchildren Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello), come along. Of course, one can guess that things are going to go horribly wrong...Steven Spielberg once again proves himself one of the masters of such entertainment, giving it a true sense of grandeur, with excellent location shooting in Hawaii and the Dominician Republic, impressive production design by Rick Carter, and effective cinematography by old pro Dean Cundey. John Williams gives the production another of his anthemic and rousing scores. Admittedly the story takes its time to really get going, but it emerges a grabber, with the tyrannosaurus rex and the velociraptors becoming true forces to be reckoned with. The dinosaurs are brought to convincing life using a variety of practical and digital effects, utilizing the talents of such gentlemen as Dennis Muren, Stan Winston, Phil Tippett, and Michael Lantieri.The actors display just the right amount of awe & wonder and subsequently apprehension and real fear, and the spectacle thankfully never overwhelms their efforts; Goldbum is priceless in his typical fashion as a charismatic eccentric; also among the well chosen supporting cast are Bob Peck as game warden Muldoon, Martin Ferrero as the lawyer Gennero, B.D. Wong as a scientist, and Samuel L. Jackson and the scene stealing Wayne Knight as other park personnel. And just as the actors show that awe & wonder, so too will the audience feel those emotions; there is real movie making magic on display here.Any kid *or* adult who's ever felt a fascination for the extinct animals of Earths' past will be pleased with the results. And the message about the nature and folly of man trying to 'play God', as it were, often a recurring theme in fantastic cinema, comes across here in high style. Very well done overall.Nine out of 10.",9,1,1,29 December 2012
Beetlejuice," He's the ghost with the most, babe.
","Tim Burtons' hilarious, visually impressive follow-up to 'Pee-Wee's Big Adventure' is pure 1980s fun, with fantastic special effects, superbly flamboyant design, a willing cast, and plenty of good, solid laughs. It holds up quite well today, a quarter century later, with a generous dose of Harry Belafonte tunes to add to its ultimately upbeat spirit. It gets down to business in fairly quick fashion, and populates its story with great and memorable characters, not the least of which is our scenery devouring title character.Michael Keaton delivers a delicious comedy performance to rival his Billy Blaze from 'Night Shift'. He's having a ball, and most of his co-stars do a fine job of playing 'straight man' (or woman) and reacting to his antics. He plays the obnoxious, fun loving spirit of Beetle Juice to perfection. His speech when he's asked about his 'qualifications' is particularly priceless stuff.He's called in when newly deceased couple Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis) find adjusting to the afterlife to be just too hard, especially when an intolerable pair played by Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara move into their old house. Eventually, they find that dealing with him is even harder as he creates a ruckus, and sets his sights on Jones's Goth-type daughter Winona Ryder.Working from a screenplay by Michael McDowell and Warren Skaaren (based on a story by McDowell and Larry Wilson), Burton is definitely in his element, crafting a blessedly wacky and unpredictable comedy that, much like the Pee-wee Herman movie, plays like a cartoon come to life. Burton also has great fun with his casting choices; in addition to those actors mentioned, veteran actress Sylvia Sidney provides a special treat by playing weary afterlife case worker Juno; also appearing are Robert Goulet, Dick Cavett, and a very funny Glenn Shadix as interior designer Otho.It's all set to a delightful Danny Elfman score and there are some great set pieces revolving around Belafontes' 'Day-O' and 'Jump in the Line'.This film does know how to send you off with a smile on your face. It's one of the most purely entertaining things that Burton has done.Eight out of 10.",8,1,2,21 September 2013
Alien: Covenant," 'What do you believe in, David?' 'Creation.'
","The latest entry in this ongoing franchise follows the action of 'Prometheus'. Our current crop of characters are colonists heading to a distant planet, who decide to check out a rogue transmission. If only they'd stuck to their original mission... They land on a different planet, where the derelict spacecraft awaits, as well as various forms of alien life. They also encounter the android David (Michael Fassbender), who's been stuck there for years. Soon their number is rapidly decreasing as they fall victim to bloody attacks.The characters are largely nondescript, and it's hard to care a lot for many of them, in this story which is kind of a remake of the first and second films. There are homages scattered about, and even Jerry Goldsmiths' atmospheric score for the legendary 'Alien' of 1979 is appropriated. It may come as a disappointment to fans of the earliest entries in this series, but taken on its own as a modern era sci-fi / horror / action flick with cutting edge technology, it serves its purpose. Some people may appreciate the high body count, and the plentiful gore. The Xenomorphs themselves are barely much of a threat here, though, as they seem to be all digital, and we don't even get to see the classic form of the species in action until the last act. Like 'Aliens' before it, it serves up more than one climax, and the action is somewhat exciting if also ridiculous (Daniels, played by Katherine Waterston, is whipped all over the place by a tether.)Starring actor Fassbender is excellent, and the main reason to watch. He actually plays two androids, David *and* Walter, the companion on this colonization project, and keeps them differentiated enough so that we're not confused. David and Walter tend to have the more interesting scenes in the film, although some fans charge that this is merely director Ridley Scott indulging in a lot of silly ideas about creation.'Alien: Covenant' is slick, high tech entertainment that may amuse very undemanding fans of sci-fi and horror, but may have others wondering where Scott - who did guide the original trendsetting film 38 years ago - could have gone so wrong.Six out of 10.",6,0,4,4 October 2017
All the President's Men," An altogether remarkable achievement.
","Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford are aces as real-life Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, who set out to solve the 'Watergate' mystery of the 1970s, which had very far-reaching implications; major White House players were involved, and it ultimately led to 37th President Richard Nixon resigning from office.All the stars align in this impeccably written (by William Goldman, based on the factual book by Bernstein & Woodward) and directed (by Alan J. Pakula) film. It's a very long (two hours, 19 minutes) but utterly engrossing combination of newspaper stories, detective stories, and exercises in straight suspense. It's one film that can actually rely on its story to generate tension; David Shires' score is just fine, but it's only sparingly used. Goldman and Pakula use dialogue and performances to hold the viewers' attention from scene to scene. There is no shortage of characters that have been morally compromised in some way, and 'All the President's Men' works as something of a procedural as our two protagonists follow all leads and interview ANY person who is WILLING to talk to them.Hoffman and Redford make a great team; Hoffman is the somewhat more colourful character, but he never overplays this aspect; the result is that they do feel like two very real people. They're literally surrounded by top actors, starting with Jason Robards as WP editor Ben Bradlee; Robards and Goldman won two of the films' four Oscars. (The others were for art direction / set decoration and sound.) The non-stop parade of talent includes Martin Balsam, Hal Holbrook (playing that mysterious informant, Deep Throat), Jack Warden, Jane Alexander, Ned Beatty, John McMartin, F. Murray Abraham, Dominic Chianese, Nicolas Coster, Lindsay Crouse (in her film debut), Richard Herd, Polly Holliday, James Karen, Allyn Ann McLerie, James Murtaugh, etc.One does have to pay attention to the story so they don't get lost, but the rewards are substantial; this great piece of work still stands over 40 years later as a part of the entire Watergate legacy. Text at the end reveals the fates of the key players in the conspiracy, for those who may not already know these details.Key to the pictures' success is that even people who lived through this era and this story have said that they were often on the edges of their seats.10 out of 10.",10,1,1,4 March 2019
Evil Dead II," 'I'll swallow your soul!' 'Swallow this!'
","Sam Raimi and company meld horror and humour in this one-of-a-kind, lively sequel to the 'original experience in gruelling terror'. They know very well that sometimes when things are simply insane, all you can do is laugh. They begin by recapping the first movie, although have to tell the story differently, not being able to obtain the rights to use archive footage. Then they launch into one of the most uproarious assaults on the senses that genre fans will ever see. Written by Raimi and fellow filmmaker Scott Spiegel, it has a delightfully over the top nature yet stops short of winking at the audience (the actors play everything very straight, as well they should). Basically, this is as fun as the genre can get. When poor, poor Ash (Bruce Campbell, now a co-producer as well) is nearly drowned in blood, or what looks to be ink, or whatever, it's impossible not to chortle. And Raimi continues to pay tribute to slapstick comedy with the films' most memorable sequence, in which Ash is victimized by his own possessed hand. One has to hand it to Campbell; this guy is one hell of a good sport, putting up with a lot as Raimi & co. set up to abuse him as much as possible. He's flying through trees, landing in puddles, being tortured physically and mentally, yet somehow he gets through it all. Here he's also starting to show signs of the character he would become in 'Army of Darkness'. The new cast members acquit themselves well, and some of them get roughed up pretty badly, too: Sarah Berry is Annie, daughter of the professor who started the whole mess in the first place, Dan Hicks is scruffy rube Jake, Kassie Wesley DePaiva his girl Bobby Joe, and Sam's younger brother Ted is a riot as the possessed version of Annie's dear old mom. Indicative of the nature of the film is when an eyeball pops out of a witches' head and flies right into Bobby Joe's mouth, not to mention the moment when objects in the cabin, including a lamp, laugh their asses off. Elements such as grasping trees and the 'Force' p.o.v. cam return, and the special effects are pretty damn amusing, especially the 'Rotten Apple Head' we see towards the end of the film. As in the first 'Evil Dead', we do get some valleys in between the various peaks, but things do build nicely towards an energetic finale. The ending, paving the way for 'Army of Darkness', is pretty ingenious and features a cameo by none other than Sam himself. That hilarious poster promises a great time for the audience, and delivers on that promise. A comedy-horror classic. Nine out of 10.",9,1,2,21 October 2012
High Fidelity," Sharp, funny, and appealing.
","John Cusack is the star, and one of the screenwriters and co-producers, of this likeable adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel. At its core, it capably tells a good romantic story, and does a very amusing job at poking fun at people who lord their supposedly superior musical knowledge (and tastes) over others. It's got an attractive and endearing cast, and it naturally also has a non-stop, eclectic soundtrack.Cusack plays Rob, the neurotic owner of a record store that is far from prosperous. His employees are the timid Dick (Todd Louiso) and the far more brash Barry (Jack Black, who walks away with the film). After his longtime girlfriend Laura (charming Danish actress Iben Hjejle) dumps him for another man, it forces him to take stock and reflect on the major relationships - and break-ups - of his life.Cusack is typically engaging, although this viewer could have done without that over-used device of having the main character directly address the camera. The film itself, despite being a little overlong, has some good laughs. I cracked up when Rob fantasized possible reactions to the annoying Ian (an amusing Tim Robbins), including a scenario of him, Barry, and Dick beating the almighty hell out of him.Some intelligent and pointed dialogue is brought to life by this talented cast, with a steady parade of lovely ladies (Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, Joelle Carter) as the women who have caught Robs' eyes over the years. Rob himself is not too sympathetic for much of the running time, but then, that is the whole point as it takes a while to pinpoint himself as a common denominator, and have his eventual epiphany.Nice cameo by rock star Bruce Springsteen, too.Seven out of 10.",7,2,2,26 November 2019
