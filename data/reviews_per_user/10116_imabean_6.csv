The Equalizer," Disappointingly sterile, emotionless, Chuck Norris style acting.
","Robert McCall is a humble big box hardware store employee with an extensive background in the CIA. He has a few coworkers with whom he's superficially friendly, but they know nothing of his secret life until the latter half of the movie.He befriends a young woman working as a prostitute for the Russian mob, and upon seeing their brutality against her he goes to bat on her behalf and goes to the Russian's HQ to offer them $9,800 to leave her alone. The Russian pimp and his associates don't care for the offer and the first mêlée of the movie ensues, and of course Denzel's character emerges, victorious and unscathed, stopping his stopwatch once the carnage has concluded.Throughout this movie, the Robert McCall character is, literally, a stone-faced killer. Whereas the original British character from The Equalizer TV series (played admirably by the late Edward Woodward) is a vigilante, helping all sorts of underdogs with his trade craft and connections, this Robert McCall focuses primarily on just the one woman who needs a hand. The original expressed emotion, had a much richer tapestry of a background, whereas this one is pretty bland. The character is as two-dimensional and stark as his rather Spartan apartment. I don't recall seeing an actor as lacking in emotions and facial expressions since Chuck Norris.Some of the confrontations McCall has with the Russians seems to hearken back to Denzel Washington's exemplary role as former CIA operative John Creasy in the remake of Man On Fire, directed by the late Tony Scott, but are far less visceral. Whereas Creasy exacts furious vengeance upon one corrupt official after another, whether by cutting one's fingers off one by one or annihilating them with rectally-inserted C4 explosive, McCall uses hands-on martial arts to dispatch his foes. Creasy's acts are fired by emotion, but McCall's don't seem fired up all that much at all. I thought for a bit I was watching a black Terminator. Even when McCall has a corrupt cop trapped in his own car at his own home, exhaust pumping in and the cop's life in his hands, he is passionless and methodical. I felt no compelling reason to cheer McCall on, no reason to root for him as I did John Creasy.In the final confrontation with the Russian hit squad, the action is sterile and uninspired. McCall is in his element in a way, finding propane tanks and nail guns and other stuff like a black MacGyver in his workplace to take out the bad guys, but this is not at all what I'd expect from Antoine Fuqua after seeing the kind of bad-ass action his characters dealt in Training Day.Some odd trivia, in the first half of the movie (specifically, when McCall is wearing ear protection and sawing plywood) you might recognize a few bits of the score from Man On Fire, just briefly. In the final scene, they've recycled Moby's hit song 'New Dawn Fades' used in the movie Heat by Michael Mann in the 90s.I'm glad I didn't pay to see this.",3,7,12,13 December 2014
John Wick," I've never seen a more human meat-eating super assassin until John Wick.
","The film begins with John Wick stumbling from a badly-damaged SUV and falling to the ground, clutching his bleeding gut. With bloody fingertips he begins playing a video on his smartphone of he and his wife at the beach, in much better times.We then flash back to Wick visiting his terminally-ill wife at the hospital to say his farewell, before telling the doctor to discontinue life support.After the funeral, Wick receives an unexpected delivery, a puppy, along with a heartfelt note from his late wife, hoping that he will embrace this dog as a companion to remind him of her.He goes for a drive, with the puppy (a beagle named Daisy) as his copilot. He stops for gas, whereupon a BMW full of Russian mobsters pulls up (one, the son of the local Russian mob boss, played by Game Of Thrones actor Alfie Allen). He takes a special interest in Wick's classic Ford Mustang, and takes offense to Wick rebuking his desire to buy the car.As you might expect, the Russians invade Wick's home. They beat Wick senseless, and kill the puppy in front of him. He cradles the dead puppy in his arms, Wick's last and precious link to his beloved wife in the world, ignites the fires of vengeance in Wick which leads him to go on an all-out rampage against the Russians. This hearkens back in my mind to Will Smith's character in 'I Am Legend', where his loyal German shepherd, Samantha, is about to turn, but he strangles it to death before that can happen. Samantha represents Will's character's daughter; Daisy represents Wick's departed wife.From here, Keanu Reeves' kung fu skills garnered from the days of The Matrix rise up and reveal the super assassin lying beneath this otherwise mild-mannered widower. Keanu Reeves plays the role as a very elegant, methodical, deadly killer.It's worth mentioning that the hotel Wick visits, The Continental, is an interesting and classy hangout for elements of the criminal underworld. Wick seeks a room at this hotel as his safe haven and as the proprietor states, 'no business may be incurred on these premises without *heavy* penalties'. The end of the story shows the mob in shambles. As Wick, severely injured, finds his way into a veterinary clinic for supplies to staunch his wounds, he hears a puppy cry out. The clipboard attached to its kennel reveals it's to be euthanized the next day.The final scenes show Wick walking out, a pit bull puppy on a leash accompanying him. One of the best action flicks I've seen, it has made its way into my top list of films.",9,7,17,17 January 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Too long, too much slow exposition, but props to Affleck's Batman.
","I feel this film had much potential that simply wasn't exploited.Batman was solid; kudos to Ben Affleck for his performance as the Dark Knight. Aside from the several cookie-cutter stern-faced grimaces, he did quite well. Superman, though... weak. Far from the rich character that was Superman in 'Man of Steel', a rather stilted delivery (was that Henry Cavill's Scottish roots peeking out in his pronunciation of 'been' a few times?) and sort of wishy-washy to boot, quite disappointing. The supposed villain, Lex Luthor, seemed more a juvenile, awkward nutjob than a world-class arch criminal; wrapped up in social awkwardness attributed to insanity, but that illusion simply doesn't work. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman was okay, but that Israeli accent really got in the way of seeing her character as an Amazon princess.The obvious and poorly-crafted mannequin of General Zod defused any remaining faith I had in what at that point was at least a halfway good flick. The strange dream flashbacks experienced by Bruce Wayne were out of left field and made no sense; who was the dude with the Robin-esque mask, was that Robin? Was that some projection from an alternate universe? No clue, and no elaboration is given, thus making it clutter.It's as if this film served to set the foundation for Wonder Woman's future films, using Batman and Superman as pawns in her game, as if she looped her magic lasso of influence around those 'super' heroes like they were accessories rather than core members of the ensemble.Glad I didn't pay to see this. Hopefully Affleck's forthcoming Batman and Gadot's upcoming Wonder Woman will make up for this rather long, drawn-out, predictable 'superhero' yarn.",6,5,8,2 July 2016
Spectre," Disappointingly bland.
","I've seen the entirety of the James Bond franchise, and this one is well toward the bottom of the list. Even Moonraker with its cheesiness beats out some of Spectre's wishy washy swipes at humor and suspense.The Spectre of old was a sinister organization with its tendrils everywhere, yet nowhere. Inscrutable, yet tangible. But today? It's dry corporate meetings, faceless roid-raged bad guys poking the eyeballs out of a rival's skull, all chaired unremarkably by James Bond's long lost brother.Really?? So much of this film is a cardboard cutout, two-dimensional and readily blown overboard, much like the beta villain C loses his balance and falls backwards to his death in the new CNS headquarters, or how Blofeld gets blown back by Bond's terribly inelegantly deployed last-ditch watch bomb.Keen listeners might recognize the re-use of a few tracks from Skyfall, perhaps this is the producers' acknowledgement that they didn't quite know where to begin, and couldn't carry it to the end effectively. Sure, Léa Seydoux makes for strong yet feminine eye candy, and Q flaunts a few bits of technical skill, but there is completely none of the synergy of previous iterations of Bond.It's all become a stale patchwork where things have begun as a figurative lump of goo on the potter's wheel and were left spinning until finally idling to a stop as an amorphous pile of vaguely-describable stuff.",3,3,7,27 December 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Typical reboot problems.
","I've been a hardcore fan of Mad Max since the 1979 film. The Road Warrior was probably one of THE greatest sequels ever. Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, was terribly cheesy in some respects, very campy, but at least stuck to its guns in portraying Max as a HUMAN BEING.Now we have Mad Max: Fury Road. Oh, George Miller, how you disappoint me and countless other cult fans inspired by your earlier works.Max in this movie is basically second fiddle to Charlize Theron's character, Imperator Furiosa. While they have pretty good synergy, Max doesn't display the kind of humanism which I so admired in the previous films. Hardy is a rather sterile, brutish Max, and though some might disagree I think Mel Gibson did a FAR better job in portraying this tortured soul whose loved ones were brutally slain by the Toecutter et al.Disappointing, to say the least. Lots of action, sure, but the elements of sweet, sweet vengeance that Max exercised are completely absent from this tawdry action flick.",2,12,25,23 October 2015
The Martian," Plausible suspense, uplifting climax.
","I hadn't seen anything beyond the first trailer and the movie posters for The Martian. Perhaps this has enabled me to review it through a perspective less jaded that some. For what it's worth, it's a good thing.The plight of marooned astronaut Mark Watney is portrayed as pretty straight-up dire based on the circumstances. First, stuck on Mars, a lifeless neighbor to Earth. Next, presumed dead with no initial hope of rescue. Then, beset with a finite amount of supplies to sustain him, he must resort to taking vacuum-sealed Thanksgiving potatoes and farming them in the human waste from himself and his colleagues. An attempt to launch an unmanned craft to crash-land into Mars and provide Watney with supplies aborts shortly after liftoff; echoes of the loss of Space Shuttle Columbia arose instantly as Sean Bean's character uttered the dreaded command in mission control, 'Lock the doors', just as his real-life counterpart LeRoy Cain had on that fateful morning of February 1, 2003.Then things get really difficult.All in all a fairly tense, yet overall uplifting look at humanity's investment in a fellow human being whom many might at first glance consider beyond hope. Thanks to numerous deficiencies in the institutional culture of NASA, the space program today is nowhere near that imagined by The Martian.Manned space exploration has been tainted by the grave losses of Challenger in 1996 and Columbia in 2003. Yet this film serves to prove that given drive, determination, collaboration, and discipline, the best humanity has to offer can be brought forth in a united effort to shake a valiant fist at fate and save someone seemingly beyond all hope.Let's hope that the driving forces behind these fictitious crew, managers, and bureaucrats will inspire their real-world counterparts to propel our fledgling space program to new heights, rather than wallow in the sorrows of the fallen.",8,2,3,17 January 2016
