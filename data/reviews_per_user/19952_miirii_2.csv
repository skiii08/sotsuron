Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," BORAT CLAIMS Kazakhstan, yet the movie is filmed in Romania
","<ul><li>I give this movie a 10, because i love Sasha Cohen (Ali G) too much... the movie kept me belly laughing non stop... It's soo funny, this is the funniest movies i have seen since Fat Pizza. The movie is soo good that i have been back to the theater two times to watch it again... It's ridiculously funny... I can't wait for the DVD with all the scenes. There are some spoilers in the movie. If you notice the movie in the beginning and the ending... When Borat claims to be in his home city of Kazakhstan, he is actually in Romania. In a poor mountain village... where people live their lives as they can. And he depicts them as being bad and prostitutes and rapists... When actually those people are the most hard working people i know, and they are very friendly and happy to see strangers. I believe they were taken advantage of when this movie was shot. It's just a shame how someone can make MILLIONS off a movie like this, most people can't tell where it was filmed but i know ROMANIAN, because i was born there and THE PEOPLE IN THE VILLAGE THEY SPEAK ROMANIAN... If you don't believe, remember the GREEN-TEAL Car BORAT GETS IN? Well it's a Romanian CAR, called 'Dacia' look it up on google.com under images and check it out for yourself... BORAT IS NOT A KAZAC! He filmed in ROMANIA... This is a shame for people of Kazaksthan and people of Romania... Ali G? What were you thinking man? How much money u got in ur bank account coz of this?</li></ul>",10,3,15,6 November 2006
The Way Back," the way back... was expecting more out of this movie
","*** WARNING this contains some spoilers *** I don't know where to begin with this movie. I was expecting something better organized and put together. I am a big fan of this type of genre-films like The Great Escape, Cool Hand Luke, The Shawshank Redemption etc. I was waiting for this movie to be released for quite some time, but after seeing it a big disappointment came to heart. The movie starts off very well, and begins to captivate the audience right from the start but as soon as the prisoners escape the compound the movie starts to dull out. Some of the things i really didn't enjoy in it were some of the scenes that were shot in the forest. In those scenes you could tell that it was a still studio shot because the trees and snow looked really fake. That is not the case with all the scenery you see in the movie thou. Another thing was the audio and sound bites, if you pay close attention when the young kid goes missing in the forest, when they search for him and yell out, the echo you hear just plainly 'screams' we are filming in a small studio. I must admit i really found the movie to be kinda boring after the escape, there was not much plot and climax, and the poor dialogue between the actors was unsuitable. Another thing is, on top of things, I mean come on Collin Farrell playing a Russian thug... i was expecting his role in the movie to be more versatile, so he is got a knife, so what? He doesn't use it very much and after you see the other escapees talk amongst themselves and saying that they should take him along for the escape because he has a knife you would think that you would see some hunting/survival techniques etc. but you don't. You see Collin Farrel with a blood stained shirt bringing back some food and vodka that he loots from a village they cross paths with. Overall i rated this movie a #2, and i must admit it hurt to do that, the lowest score i ever gave a movie since i been on IMDb.com from early 2000's and that is just because the only thing you could find worthy in the movie in my opinion its the scenery, it's what saves the movie from being deplorable.",2,14,28,3 May 2011
