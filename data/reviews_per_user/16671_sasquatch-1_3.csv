Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," my two pence
","Well I was very disappointed by this movie. No, Jar Jar doesn't bother me in the slightest, my gripe boils down to the script which i found to be both lazy (phantom is just a remake of Jedi, and New Hope, exactly the same things happen in three star wars movies now), and contradictory to the original films which maintain that Yoda taught Obi wan, not Quai Gon Who? One of the most irritating parts was the science, blood tests and midi clorians (excuse the spelling) seem so out of place in star wars, explaining 'the force', and Jedi in this way is akin to dissecting dragons and unicorns. To sum up i wish this film didn't seem so rushed as it does script wise, well there's always the next two films.",1,19,37,29 January 2001
Resident Evil," Oh my God, words cannot describe...
","This was the worst film I've ever had the misfortune to see in my entire existence!!!!! This 'film' was physically, emotionally and mentally draining to watch, it should have come with a public health warning.",1,13,23,22 July 2002
Saving Private Ryan," SPOILER ALERT
","The first 20-30 mins of war are breath taking, one sits there in wonder as to 'could I have done this?', or 'what the hell was it like to be there?', which is where the film for me personally falls down later on, because no matter how undeniably advantageous the presence of the US to allies during the war was, they were'nt the only allies at Dunkirk!! Now admittedly it could be deemed more offensive to have British, Canadian troops etc as guest stars, or bit roles, but I think what nulls this argument is the stars and stripes we are drowned in at the end of the movie!! Now unfortunately comparisons will always be made to the thin red line, if no other reason than because they were released in the same year. There you have an engagement where Americans were the only allies present!!, yet this fact isn't driven down our throats by a flag pole!! The other main gripe is the villian of the feature, the German soldier who we see begging for his life, and who we are made to realise is a human being after all. Quite a moving piece of cinema, which later on is ruined by the reappearance of the said German, all suited up and ready for killing the main characters. 'y'see they should've killed him after all' a phrase undoubtedly uttered by many people watching, but don't those people hate Germans any way?, wasn't it a bolder move to let us feel sorry for him and leave it at that? Overall an over-hyped film all explosions and fairy tale, from let's face it the most over-hyped director in the world. 'I liked jaws but.....'",5,0,1,7 September 2001
