Requiem for a Dream," One of the best movies I've ever seen...rollercoaster ride.
","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen by far, and for many different reasons.  Number one, the imagery in the movie and the techniques used as far as camera angles and just the picture in general are so unique and effective its amazing.  I wish more movies were as artistically shot as this one.  Someone, the most normal and average thing jumped off the screen and seemed extra creepy and eerie to me.  Also, the sound track is very effective.  Notice how the same sounds are repeated throughout the film. There are true psychological techniques used here and they are so effective. I was just sucked into the movie whether I wanted to be or not...you can't help it.  There are repetative scenes as well such as the dialating eyes, the opening and closing of the mail box, the smoking, the drug use, the blood rush...these are used thru out and are very effective.  The basic plot is about Harry (Jared Leto) and his relationships with his mother, girlfriend, and best friend, and how they each are effected by addiction. You will be jilted by this movie...trust me.  I couldnt sleep.  It touched my soul like no other movie ever has, but in a very dark way.  If only more movies could truly capture emotion and force you to feel it like this movie does, it truly is a real life rollercoaster ride, yet you never even have to move.  I will admit, when I first watched the movie, I was not sober, but that just helped me be sucked in even more.  I was laughing for the first half even, then the turning point for me was the conversation that Harry has with his mother when he comes to visit and tell her he is buying her a new TV.  It is like you see the fake comments, but hidden in there is true emotion and pain when the mother says how she is lonely.  The mother/son relationship was the most gut wrenching thing for me to see and it left me feeling like I was a bad son, but I think we can all relate to that scene were its obvious Harry loves his mother and wants to do the right thing, but just doesn't know how, or they just are too different from each other to really be on that same level.  This movie is great because it doesn't just show one stereotype, it shows the mother being addicted and going crazy and will make you think twice when you see a bum on the subway.  I don't think I can even express any more about this film in words, everything will be expressed when you watch it for yourself...",10,0,1,15 January 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," should have ended this way...
","The Matrix is not a trilogy, its just the first movie.  The other 2 ruin it. Part three is the nail in the coffin.  It is watchable, but in my opinion a far cry from the genius that was shown in the first installment.  The next 2 chapters have too many religious references using Neo as 'the savior'.  What should have been done is this:Matrix Revolutions should have had it turn out that there was a Matrix within a Matrix and in reality, it was humans enslaving other humans to use them as energy by tricking them into thinking they were at war with the machines, when really, there were no machines.  That would have been a much more mind blowing ending and making quite a statement about human nature at the same time, and people would have watched the movie and left in aw. Instead, everyone is upset at how bad the ending was.",Null,0,0,8 April 2004
