Mission: Impossible III," Amazing. Eye Candy + Heart Stopping Action. Only Spontaneous Sex is better than this.
","We are familiar with the lit fuse slowly burning its way to the detonator... We are supposed to be sweating bullets with every centimeter closer it burns to the explosion. Though this image may have lost its power with us, the element of a countdown to an imminent explosion was used in the opening, pre-title sequence to a heart-stopping degree. You feel the desperation, you yourself are begging for a positive resolution, the villain with his finger on the trigger is focused enough to not even let up for one second. BAM. It's beautiful. And once again we are brought into the world of Ethan Hunt and the IMF. Without going on and on about the movie, the plot and the details, let me just say that this movie is absolutely THE action movie of the year if not from the past couple of years. I just want to address the non-team like story lines that we've had to deal with when it came to Ethan Hunt. I'm one of those kids raised on the TV series. The IMF were all about the TEAM with everyone having their own disguises, actions that seemed random then coming together as part of the plan all along, something going awry and the team having to tap dance until it comes together again... Then came the movies and it was the Ethan Hunt Show. Well, this movie brings back the complicated Team sequence. By far, the Vatican scene was highly enjoyable and genius. So many complicated twists and turns, it made my inner child tear up. Really good stuff. And one last thing that was pleasantly surprising. This movie is so subversively political in the subplot that it makes me squee.Put aside your being sick of the overpromotion and the antics of the star. Bring your action-loving self to this movie, sit back and just let it take you. This movie is the best of the franchise and one of the best from the past few years.Make it happen.",9,0,1,8 May 2006
