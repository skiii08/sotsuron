The Devil's Advocate," One of the best
","First the bad points....Keanu's accent.Now for the good, this is one of the best films I have ever seen.  The story is one where it requires several viewings to really get into the skin of what is happening to the charactures.I bought this on DVD a month ago, and I think I've started to wear the thing out, the director's commentry reveals so much about the film, I recommend you listen to it.One of Al Pacino's best.",9,1,1,28 July 2002
The Truman Show," I liked this one, but only after a second viewing
","After leaving the cinema I have three ways of ranking a film, I can't stop talking about it, I want a refund, or what the hell was that all about????The Truman Show had me thinking what was that all about.  I saw it again on Sky and really enjoyed the experience this time, maybe because I was alone and had more time to think, or maybe because I was a little older...I don't know.I'm not a huge fan of Jim Carey but I have to admit, his acting in this film was outstanding and Ed Harris was perfect, at the end I was starting to crack, I believed he thought of Truman as a son.In all a great film, but you need to fully engrose yourself in it to get the most out of it.My rating 9/10",9,0,1,4 June 2002
