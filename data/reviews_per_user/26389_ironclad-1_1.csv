Mission: Impossible III," Now that was a hell of a ride
","If you're one of the people who won't see this movie because of Cruise's couch hopping last year or Scientology you can stop reading here, because that'll be the last time I mention it. You're missing out, though.The movie was all I hoped it would be. Director J.J. Abrams took all the best aspects of his excellent Alias show and blew them up for the big screen. He did all the things right that John Woo messed up in the second part. The movie has no less than five really exciting action sequences (especially 'the Vatican' and 'the bridge' are awesome fun) and a great cast (especially Hoffmann and the delicious Maggie Q). It isn't always logical or realistic but keeps you on the edge of your seat with its very emotional and exciting pace. It's so incredibly fast my drink was still half full when the end credits started after two hours. Definitely the best movie of the series and one of the best action movies of the last few years. If you except nothing more you'll have a fun ride. Thank you, J.J.!",8,0,1,6 May 2006
