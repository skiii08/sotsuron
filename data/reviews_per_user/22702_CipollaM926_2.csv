The Avengers," The most overrated film of all time. It's just not good.
","It may be mildly entertaining, but it's still just other very long and slow mix of tired battle scenes and some wooden, masturbatory, borderline cringe-worthy dialogue, all leading to a predictable ending. There were a couple good laughs but that doesn't really make up for the fact that this was over two hours and twenty minutes. Robert Downey, Jr. was the best part because his sarcasm is great. It's too bad I can't really say much about the rest. And keep in mind, I genuinely like the Iron Man movies and Captain America.Here, everyone's already established and undefeatable. What's the point of having characters that you can't root for, and therefore you don't care about the outcome? They never hit rock bottom, therefore there's no end to the second act, therefore the whole film is completely unsatisfying. And again, it's boring. Two and a half hours leading to an obligatorily happy and sequel-welcoming ending. Dear Lord, change it up.Why was The Dark Knight Trilogy good? Because it had human characters that had legitimate weaknesses, therefore carrying on the plot that had the characters grow, and if they died, we felt sad. Why? Because we cared for them. Why did we feel bad for James Bond in Casino Royale? We believed he loved Vesper and the third act was made with an emotional punch. Why did we care for Silva in Skyfall? He was a great villain because he was funny, menacing, fantastically portrayed by Javier Bardem, and his motives had a believable character background. M captivated our interest, and it was a well-developed, terrifically-acted character that had great mother-son chemistry with Bond. The Avengers has none of that, just pretty cities that go boom, slapstick humor and throwaway lines, all on repeat. The characters interact with each other like annoying small children, and the same dialogue constantly put on repeat made me so bored.4/10, bad, below average, horrifically overrated, two thumbs down, etc.",4,9,17,26 April 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Too ambitious for its own good. *possible mild spoilers*
","I loved the crap out of all of the Scream movies and I love self-aware, postmodern stuff, but this was stupid. I love what the filmmakers were going for and I think it's a great idea, but it could have been approached much better.The movie works well for most of the first act, but in the later half of the second act is where we hit a steep decline. While it's smart, it suddenly tries to be some sort of sci-fi-zombie- conspiracy-Armageddon-comedy which makes it feel horribly disjointed as it tries to hit too many territories. It could have done really well in one or two fields, but it does poorly in all of them because it's stretched out way too thin.Scary? No, not in the slightest. Over the top? Yes. I know that they were aiming for this but they took it too far to where I couldn't stop rolling my eyes the entire time. Funny? No, not really, more so just corny. Thought provoking? You could say it is mildly, but not to what it thinks it is.All in all, The Cabin in the Woods is not scary at all and unfortunately poorly done. It tries to be so many genres that it fails at being all of them and there's too much inane crap going on. If a movie tries to be smart but it's overshadowed by extraneous plot lines, sexuality, and drug usage, its cleverness is hidden and immediately forgotten. You're thinking right now, 'BUT WAIT! It's making fun of the clichés!' My response is that the sexuality could have been hinted at, and the fact that they directly showed it seemed to bow down to stereotypical horror movie clichés, and the drug usage was unneeded. You can just have the character be a total dumbass.5.5/10, F, two thumbs down, etc.",9,4,9,29 May 2012
