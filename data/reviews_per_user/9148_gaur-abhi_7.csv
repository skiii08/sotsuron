Requiem for a Dream," How dreams are shattered
","Well an 8+ rating on the IMDb site does raise the expectations for any movie. Add to that some good recommendations by friends and I was really wanting to the see the movie. 'Hard hitting' is what I will like to describe this movie as. A work of a genius.The movie is about drugs and their effects on young lives. I haven't seen a better movie made on the harmful effects of the drugs. It hits you hard, in your face. Brilliant performances by Ellen Burtyn, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly. Ellen is simply superb in the portrayal of a single, lonely aging mother of Jared. She even won an Oscar nomination for that.In the end, its a sad movie. But that is what a movie on drug addiction should be. Sad, Lonely and Frightening. It serves the purpose. I would highly recommend it to all. Especially to those who think that having drugs is fun. Watch this movie and you will leave drugs for good.",9,2,4,3 November 2006
Se7en," Gruesome, Dark, Grotesque, yet Brilliant
","Writing a review for this movie seems to be almost as difficult as the exercise of watching it. No, please do not take it in the negative sense. But the adjectives that come to the mind when thinking about the movie are very mixed, 'Brilliant', 'Grotesque', 'Depressing', 'Brutal', 'Unique'. The story is that of a psychotic killer, whose each kill is a 'modern day' representation of the original Seven sins from the ancient texts. The sins are Gluttony, Sloth, Greed, Pride, Lust, Envy and Wrath. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are the two homicide detectives that have been assigned this case. In fact, it is Morgan's last case, as he is due to retire soon. The case becomes more and more intriguing as each murder unfolds. Each murder is more gruesome and more gory than the previous one. (I must say at this point that it has been one of the most difficult movies to watch. Watching it alone at night ,as I did, is definitely not recommended.) By this time audience is certain that the killer is brilliant but a very twisted guy. A very clever technique employed by the director here is that he has not shown any crime being done in action, all are just the post murder shots of the dead. Just the level of detailing shown in the movie makes an amazing treat. Morgan Freeman is as usual very good. But it is Brad Pitt that really shows amazing acting abilities especially during the last part of the movie, the final confrontation scene between Brad, Morgan and the killer. Having said that movie belongs to the killer, who is the eventual winner (you will have to see the movie to find that out). Kevin Spacey as the killer has only around 15-20 minutes of the role during the end. But by Jove, he does carry it off amazingly well. While watching the movie, I was really wondering how would the director show the viciousness of the killer, which he has shown earlier during the murders. But Spacey carries it out with ease. He is a rare breed of an actor. A class apart. One had to just look in to his eyes and the expressions on his face, to become convinced that he is same person that performed all those murders. Also worth mentioning is how well the movie ends. The last sequence, the last two murders ( or should I say the Sins) are a treat to watch. What an ending. In the end, I would like to quote the brilliant director himself, Mr David Fincher, to understand why the movie is so dark, stark and gruesome. 'I don't know how much movies should entertain. To me I'm always interested in movies that scar. The thing I love about JAWS is the fact that I've never gone swimming in the ocean again.'",9,0,0,18 March 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Dark comedy at its best
","Being a great fan of Mr Kubrick, it was with great expectations that I saw this movie. And I was not disappointed. Its a cult film, an in your face, dark comedy on the state of affairs during the cold war days. The characters are very cleverly created and portrayed in even better manner by some very talented actors like George C Scott, Peter Summers and more. I was particularly impressed by George. The storyline, the characterization, the situations, are all top class. Its a story about how a lunatic general makes a mockery of the various safety procedures, that our Governments keeps promising us with respect to the Nuclear Arms and their usage, and orders his B52 bombers to attack USSR with nuclear warheads. What follows is a crazy sequence of events in which the USA govt tries its best to some how control the situation and recall the planes. In between it also makes an attempt to bring to notice to strange ways with which the Govts and Defence Establishment work together. The telephonic conversations between the two head of states of USA and USSR are very hilarious.Its a movie not to be missed. 10 out of 10 for me.",10,1,2,21 August 2006
Life Is Beautiful," The most aptly named movie - A classic
","I have never in my life seen a movie that so truly symbolizes its name and its message. Roberto Benigni - 'The Italian Treasure House' has probably given to his viewers his best. The story, the performances, the entire theme of a person performing his duties as a husband, as a father is very 'moving' and inspiring. 'Life is beautiful' as the name goes is about a Jewish man, who falls in love with a non-Jewish lady, marries her, has a kid and who is then taken as a prisoner in a concentration camp along with his wife and kid. But the way he protects his kid from the horrors of the genocide, how he always tries to find ways to make his wife and kid smile and laugh, is what makes the movie, a MUST SEE.It is certainly one of the best movies that I have seen.",9,163,222,12 November 2005
Mystic River," A sophisticated murder mystery - Awesome
","Very rarely does Clint Eastwood deliver a product that is not up to the mark or below average. 'Mystic River' is definitely not one; in fact it is one of his bests ever. In Mystic River he tries to explore how incidents in our childhood affect our lives in a big way, in fact they probably shape our destiny. ( I am sure this was intended - The starting scene where the three kids are embossing their names on a freshly cemented pavement, just before Tim is picked up by the padeophile, is conveying the above message. Later On, a grown up Tim sees the same pavement, with the partially completed names, once again. Surely God is in the details...bravo !! CLINT...bravo!!)The story is that of three boys growing up in the same neighbourhood. One of them suffers at the hands of a paedophile. He grows up to become a slightly mentally disturbed, lost guy played amazingly well by Tim Robbins. His other two friends become a local don (again played beautifully by Sean Penn) and one a homicide detective (Kevin Bacon). Sean's teenage daughter is murdered and thenstarts a whodunits chase. Both Sean and Kevin want to catch the culprit first. The former wants to seek revenge and the latter to seek justice. Tim's role in the murder is not ruled out as he was in the same bar as the girl just prior to the murder.The movie is simply amazing to watch for its sheer intensity of acting by Sean and Tim. This is probably Tim's second best performance ever after 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Excellent direction by Clint leaves the audience at the edge of their seats for almost the entire duration of the movie. I will not ruin your suspense by telling you the end.It is a must watch for the Clint Eastwood and Thriller fans.",9,5,9,16 November 2005
The Departed," Good, but could have been better
","The trouble with watching a Scorsese film is that your expectations shoot up tremendously. So you do not expect the movie to be good, but you expect it to be brilliant. But here lies the problem...The Departed falls short of being called a great movie. Its good, story is brilliant (had to be as it was based on a superb script of 'Infernal Affairs'), actors are very convincing as well, dialogues crisp, scenes and situations well thought out..hey, u would be wondering then where did it lack...this question is troubling me as well...why did I not enjoy this movie as much as say a 'Goodfella'?...what was it that this movie lacks? I do not have a very clear answer for that..but my guess is that probably it is a combination of many factors..Too many characters..too many co-incidences...and I feel there should have been more time spent on building up the characters..showing more of their childhood events...I have always felt that by doing so, you can grab the audience attention very well..here it was just 1 minute sequences shown here and there...nothing that can hook up the audience...But hey it still is a good movie...DiCaprio has really matured (and this performance should finally answer his critics for good), Nicholson is Nicholson..always in his own zone...and a surprise package in the form of Mark Wahlberg..a very good performance...probably his best performance yet.... So do watch this movie...you definitely will like it...but do not have expectations of a movie which is in top 100 of the IMDb 250 list...:)",8,0,1,17 November 2006
Downfall," Hail Hitler !!!
","Hitler is definitely one of the most enigmatic and larger-than-life personalities to have lived in the 20th century. His views, ideologies are very disturbing and smell of hatred and detest towards a particular community. His actions confirm his distorted view of the world and the amount of damage that it inflicted on humanity as a whole.'The Downfall' captures the last few days in the life of this person as seen by a lady personal assistant. It is most certainly one of the best movies to have been made on Hitler. The Direction, cinematography, acting, are all top class. Most of the movie is shot inside the famed bunkers of Hitler.Movie shows how Hitler in spite of realizing that the war was lost, kept on making fantasy plans of how he would be defending Germany while his closest troops stood in silence. One of the highlights of the movie is the portrayal of Hitler by Bruno Ganz. It is as if one is seeing Hitler himself, and not some actor trying to impersonate him. He is that good.Some of the scenes leave a lasting impression. Like a mother poisoning her children, Hitler's assistants not leaving him even when they are sure that it will lead to death, Hitler's own suicide with his wife.Do watch this movie, and get enthralled by a spectacle...",9,2,4,27 March 2008
