Mission: Impossible III," Among best of Hollywood in years
","This is an excellent well rounded production that keeps you very interested from beginning to end. I was very impressed with the creativity involved in this production, not only in the action sequences and story line, but also in the unique gadgets and gizmos used by the secret agent team.Honestly, I am not a big fan of the MI movies, or for Tom Cruise for that matter, but this movie is undoubtedly amongst the best that Hollywood has put out recently. I seriously can not find one flaw in this movie; the production quality is rich and sleek, and it keeps you highly entertained from beginning to end. The plot is not the most elaborate, but it is an ideal foundation for the rapid, ongoing dialogue of intense action and dramatic special effects sequences that carry you briskly from the begging to the very end of this exciting journey.Despite my lack of enthusiasm for him, Tom Cruise maintains a very believable character that you can really root for. The plot provides just the right amount of emotional substance, but not so much that it weighs down the movie even in the slightest.Don't hesitate to see this movie, you wont regret it!",10,0,1,7 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Superb!
","Despite the 2 hour and 45 minute length of this film, the story remained lively and entertaining throughout. Excellent acting performances were delivered in the leading roles, and the cinematography was very impressive. CGI seamlessly blended in with reality throughout this impressive film, and it is hard to distinguish reality from the pirate world we are swept into during the course of this movie.I absolutely loved the 1st Pirates, but the second one was a bit overdone and just didn't work for me; there were dull moments and weaknesses in the story line of #2. This third installment, however, was quite possibly the best of the three. The first was hard to compare with, because it was something entirely new, yet this one takes the series to an entirely different level. At World's End is among the best movies to come out in modern times with respect to musical score, special effects, and creativity of story line. Jonny Depp also delivers one of his best performances 'till date in this one.The level of imagination went into the story was remarkable, and what great promise has been established for future sequels! I was especially impressed to see how well the various qualities of this production were seamlessly intertwined to deliver an exhilarating, uplifting, and awe-inspiring journey from beginning to end. Don't hesitate going to see this one on the BIG SCREEN. It is one to remember.",8,5,8,3 June 2007
