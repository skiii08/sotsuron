Requiem for a Dream," Must watch, but only ONCE
","From a viewer point of view, sometimes you like movies not to be so frank. Sometimes you prefer movies lie to you and let you get away from this ,somehow, ugly world. But if you are looking for this you should never watch this 'requiem for a dream'. This is a truely honest story of poor poeple engaging themselves with drugs and start destroying their not-so-beautiful life, second by second through the film. Like othe aronofsky films, the atmosphere is bothering in almost every scene, specially in the first 60 minutes. You might feel nothing about the film and want not to continue. But then the final 30-40 minutes arrives, everything changes, the atmosphere, the composition, the rhythm, everything, and it engages you with the story, with the characters, and then you can't move away. You want to find out where these people gonna reach. So you will stay with the film and you will follow it. To be honest the atmosphere remains bothering, torturing your mind and soul. But you are somehow surprised and you can't just let it go. So surely you will be more satisfied with yourself for choosing this film to watch when the final credits apear with that amaizing soundtrack in comparison to when you were watching the opening scenes with the same soundtrack.
Finally, perhaps this film is a little bit overrated with that 82 position among toprated 250 movies. But no doubt it is a very good, dark but honest movie you should watch. But only once because you can't and I think you don't want to watch it again. But you will always remember its amaizing brilliant soundtrack and you may want to listen to it again and again.",7,1,1,26 December 2018
