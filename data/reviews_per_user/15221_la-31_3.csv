The New World," Beauty of Spirit and Nature
","This film, if taken on the level(s) of what it sets out to portray, is gorgeous and simply without equal. It has its flaws, but it's a film that ought to be judged by the vision which drives it. On the aesthetic level, one can hardly find flaw with it. Malick is brilliant in that he incorporates elements which mainstream Hollywood has trained itself and its unthinking audiences to avoid and/or have no taste for : long, drawn-out scenes of nature, many times of simple stillness or limited 'action'; actors using their bodies and faces rather than the spoken word ; soundtrack-musicless scenes which transport the viewer into that place and time... There are countless other examples to be sure. This was the first film by Terrence Malick that I've seen, and I loved this style. There will be some who will not enjoy it, so be warned. I, however, was prepared for it, having read about the film and Malick's style beforehand. I had moderate expectations of this film, going in, and they were completely surpassed.Malick is also walking an interesting line between myth and reality in this film. It's a unique combination which I've not seen before. Although the film has elements which are more realistic than in other portrayals of the Pocahontas story, the film's story, in the end, recounts the known 'legend' version. So people will potentially find 'holes' in that aspect of the film. I am not altogether familiar with the most historically accurate chain of events, but I found the reverential treatment of Pocahontas by the white settlers a bit extreme. Especially since she was the only female for quite some time in the colony, and was surrounded by a bunch of desperate, half-starved men.However, it's important to note the themes which really drive this film, which I am assuming, are Malick's vision : the almost spiritual beauty of the untouched wilderness of Virginia ; the similar purity of the Native tribes, so fittingly referred a few times as 'naturals,' and the vile intrusion on all this by the white colonization. I believe the portrayal of the English colonists and the elements they brought with them is as close to reality as I've ever seen in a film. They were shown as not necessarily intending evil (well, at least not all the time!), just doing things as they thought fit, without regard to anything else. Malick still doesn't excuse the evil outcome of all this, and is simply contrasting the two societies. And what a stark contrast! I'm not Native American, but to me, the film portrayed the tribes with a post-modern perspective of admiration, almost envy, and the fascination of an outsider. And clearly from a point of sympathy. In the end, one can never escape the fact that people lived on this land, and strangers from afar came with expectations of usurping it. Simple as that. If one reverses the roles, ie, whites in their native land contending with strangers from afar, one can get an idea of that sympathy. At least, that's how I always imagine it, and I never understand people who feel defensive and try to justify colonialism. There is justification for respect for another in their land, and mutual trade and co-existence. There is no justification for hostility, stealing land and genocide.All of the actors in this film were outstanding. I think all the Native American actors deserve recognition for their amazing transformations. The way they moved, looked, stood, crouched, etc. It was phenomenal to watch. In all the scenes involving the tribe, I was just riveted, in awe. In all honesty, I felt the amazement, curiosity, fascination, and trepidation which those early colonists probably felt. This is probably a result of the whole style, but the Native actors deserve praise for this.The three main actors, Q'orianka Kilcher, Colin Farrell and Christian Bale, were excellent. Kilcher was completely believable in her portrayal of the instinctual teenaged Pocahontas. She was natural in the role, though she is so young. Between Farrell and Bale, I had much higher expectations of the latter, and he didn't disappoint. He was just amazing. Bale's John Rolfe has much less screen time, and less dialogue but he was able to capture and convey the conflict and past of the character effectively. I have to admit that I am a prior fan of Bale, but Colin Farrell is the one whom I'd vote 'most improved.' His portrayal of John Smith is surprisingly nuanced, complex and rather subdued, the latter in keeping with the whole theme of the film. I think it's quite a feat for Colin Farrell, who really should be proud of his performance. I was going to make a comment about his Irish accent, which he makes no effort to disguise, but since Malick didn't have a problem with it, who am I? :) But truly, I think this has to be one of Christian Bale's best performances, though I haven't seen all his films (just three others). Part of the reason why I enjoyed his performance, and the others, is that I had read that Malick was asking the actors to ad-lib a lot. So I watched for this, and actually noted such a naturalness in many scenes, that I thought they HAD to be ad-libbed! My own favorite is when Pocahontas falls down, and she and John Rolfe dissolve into laughter. That seemed completely genuine / unscripted. It was a very sweet moment to leave in an otherwise awe-inspiring film.If there is one complaint that I have, it's that I find the love story/triangle rather trite, but then again it has its roots in history, and that's not really a criticism of the cast or director or the others who performed their jobs beautifully on this film.",7,4,9,1 February 2006
Pitch Black," A unique pleasant surprise - highly recommended
","I saw this on video - and was pleasantly surprised. The sci-fi/horror genre is very tired and trite - but this film managed to take a pretty standard premise and give it some interesting and creative twists. I also like the fact that the actors are not big stars (which obviously changed for Vin Diesel). Unique to have some Muslims in the future - what a concept. As a Muslim, I thought that was dope! This movie is far better than the sequel, the Chronicles of Riddick, which is visually more stunning and complicated, but absolutely lame in the plot department.What really makes this film unique is the alien/monster. Highly recommended.",7,0,1,12 January 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Mixed Emotions of a female X-Men fan
","I wasn't going to write a review of this film - but after seeing how well it did at the box office, and seeing people rushing to heap praise on it, I felt compelled to write this.I don't understand how anyone who has been an X-Men fan from before the first film could truly like this film. Now, that doesn't mean I'm saying don't go see it. But it doesn't necessarily mean that you will be entirely happy with what you see. I never read / bought comic books except for the rebooted X-Men in the 90s. I realize now that X-Men fans accepted and even appreciated the first two films because Bryan Singer is a talented filmmaker who didn't ignore (for the most part) the excellent writing and artistry of the X-Men phenomenon. I had a friend tell me that she's really not into superhero/science fiction films except for the X-Men. I think it can be explained by the 'team' aspect. It's because X-Men involve multiple personalities, powers, and the interplay on a 'team' of superheroes. That's why the 'Superfriends' was always my favorite Saturday morning cartoon show when I was a child (yes, I know it's cheese). And hands down, the X-Men which flowed from those crazy minds at Marvel and Stan Lee are, hands down, the coolest superheroes ever. Wolverine alone, with his back story, is a legend.This film delivers on the action, but to me the fights don't make sense (as many have pointed out on the message boards). And the scene with Jean Grey disintegrating Xavier with her mind was mindblowing (no pun intended). Well, to me those are the only two high points. If you want to see some mutants in action, and are not particular about which ones, then see the film. But I had issues with a whole host of things about this film - so Wolverine finds Cyclops' glasses, brings them back and NO ONE SAYS ANYTHING ??? The death of Cyclops deserves something more than a passing reference long after he has died!!! Why did Phoenix kill him? For the hell of it? She could have killed lots of lesser people, she tortures or plays with others, yet she kills the man who resurrects her. This was basically the most ridiculous part of the film. And no one blinks an eye. The final assault with Magneto lobbing cars set on fire by Pyro has to be the lamest idea I can think of. That scene lacked the intensity and mass scale that a true X Men fight could entail. And other than Storm and Wolverine, we're left with no one else with whom we've connected. Iceman just seemed too 'green.' It was all about Wolverine. The script of this film is lame, and is it me, or do the actors look like they're done with this? Of course, Halle Berry has never really been Storm - she was always 'phoning in' her performance, and has always just played Halle Berry in an X-Men uniform.This movie is definitely worse than its predecessor, so don't let ticket sales fool you. What else were people gonna see on Memorial Day weekend? People are seeing this film DESPITE the fact that Brett Ratner has completely massacred (in some cases literally) the X-Men name. They're seeing this film because of the X-Men - who shine through a crap-fest of a film. And yeah, a lot of stuff explodes and there are loud noises. Enjoy. I could have done without.",4,0,1,31 May 2006
