The Sound of Music," A tale of courage and love set in World War II (based on a true story)
","I grew up admiring Maria Von Trapp. The joy their family had with 7 children. I'm sure it influenced me to want a large family as well.The integrity that everyone had in the family was incredible. I love any movie where the main man in the movie has principles and sticks to them. This one has principles and courage in spades.It's such a completely innocent movie with romance and love being the dominate themes in male/female relationships. This is not a movie in which lust plays any part.I love the gentle parenting it shows. I love the obedient children it shows.Talking points: Young love - does it often last? Who do you owe the most allegiance to, God of the government? Do we get blessings in life because of good behavior?",10,8,9,6 June 2017
