Scarface," FAB DVD
","I watched the new DVD in DTS last night and I thought it was amazing. A few people on Amazon were bi*ching about the sound mix. Yes, the dialogue is rough sounding in some spots, but that's part of what makes the film what it is. I really wouldn't want Tony's opening scene to be crystal clear. It has the sound of an old crime film noir from the 40's-- ya get it?? I think that's the point....They did an amazing job with the print & the sound. Really a different experience than the cropped sliced and diced VHS. The film just comes off 100% better when seeing it this way. Gives you a better appreciation of DePalma's vision... Like watching a new movie.A few scenes on the top of my head that come off completely different than the old print: the uprising scene, the bathtub scene & the New York scene. These all play out now on a new level. Much of this has to do with seeing the original 2.35 aspect ratio. And the image & sound is clean.Performances are all memorable -- Pfeiffer & Mastrantonio particularly come off better than in the previous edition I saw. Bauer is great...And Pacino of course is legend now.A lot of people have griped about Moroder's score, but I'm one of those that believes that the score is what lends the film its period authenticity. The only part that's a little cheesy for me is that Highway to the Danger Zone-esuqe montage with the beauty salon/wedding/tiger on a leash thing. I still can't stomach those few minutes- lol.Although this movie received only a few accolades in its day, I believe it will be considered a true classic film. So many movies have been made in history, but only a few endure the test of time. This will be one of them. Like producer Martin Bregman has said, it is the 'On the Waterfront' of its day, Pacino is our generation's Brando.And for those of you who are still moaning about the 5.1 mix-- just take a toke and chill out. Enjoy, cause this is American film in its best form...",Null,0,1,2 October 2003
28 Days Later...," Brilliant film marred by its ending
","I highly recommend this film, I think it is well made and is worth viewing even for the atmosphere alone.Every once in a while a film comes along which plays eloquently, then veers in a strange inconsistent direction, most likely at the request of industry execs to assure mass audience satisfaction. What Lies Beneath was another such film.Possible spoilers28 Days is much more than a simple by the numbers horror flick. It addresses themes of paranoia in society, and the dangers that the paranoia can yield. It also addresses the danger of power in a heightened state of fear. On that level, it works very well as a commentary on the current political climate in our world.From the start, Danny Boyle poses a non-conventional approach to the story. His use of Digital Camera, male as a sex object (as opposed to female), enlightened & strong female protagonists, the destruction of foreshadowing (the 4 surviving horses), etc.In all respects the beginning carries all the marks of a fiercely independent film, with enough atmosphere to burn.All this said, the last 20 minutes of the movie feel really cheap. Rather than continue to break convention, Boyle chooses an ending which surely is a crowd pleaser. And even after seeing the alternate endings, something still doesn't feel right. And all I could keep thinking is how I would have liked it to end differently.Romero's Night of the Living had a daring, disturbing, unconventional ending -- especially for 1968, but of course NOTLD was an independent film... then I looked at the 28 days box & saw the FOX VIDEO logo & realized that beneath it all, it is still a big studio movie... so the ending has unfortunately been comprimised.Even with the additional endings featured on DVD (and probably because of them), the film feels unstable. The viewer is left with uncertainty of the director's vision & statement. So adding the 'alternate' endings to the contrived studio ending just leaves more confusion as to Boyle's original message. And this is upsetting because the rest of the film plays out so perfectly.Nonetheless, my personal gripes aside, I still think it's a brilliant movie and quite enjoyable as a whole. The greatest disappointment is that a film that would strive so hard to break convention would slide carelessly back into it at the end.",Null,0,1,3 November 2003
Velvet Goldmine," What ever happened to Brian Slade... who cares
","I really, really wanted to like this movie. I read very mixed things, yet still it would NOT deter me. I suppose after recently viewing 'Far From Heaven,' and seeing Todd Haynes' name attached to this, I had my expectations way too high.Style in the film is cool, but the opening title sequence reminds me of what didn't quite make the cut of the first Austin Powers flick.The main issue for me was that I didn't really feel for any of the characters. They all seemed like one dimensional caricatures.Never did I feel the soul behind Brian Slade (his inspirations, his songwriting, his artistic process -- isn't that a big part of a musician?!) All I know is he's a guy that likes to perform in flamboyant clothing, with no reference to where his music is really coming from. And the music wasn't terribly inspiring either. And I never forgot he is lip syncing.Toni Colette did a good job, but the film makers never have enough consideration to explain why her accent vacillates from British to American throughout the film. (Is it for Brian's image? No one is telling me) Anyway, she was probably the best in the film. Ewan did what he could with the material.And there are some 'Citizen Cane' references, but there's no Rosebud, and at least I cared about Cane.So cut to the bottom lines:1) If you want to see a brilliant Todd Haynes film, see 'Far From Heaven'2) If you want to see a brilliant glam rock film with a killer soundtrack, great production, and some SOUL, see 'Hedwig & The Angry Inch'3)If you want to see Ewan McGregor nude, see 'The Pillow Book'",1,16,27,3 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Convincing?
","There seems to be a lot of convincing going on in The Two Towers...Master Samwise convincing Faramir to let him & Frodo go... Merry & Pippin convincing Treebeard to attack Isengard... The 'angel' music convincing the audience to FEEL SAD NOW... The 'theme' music convincing the audience to FEEL VICTORIOUS NOW... Peter Jackson convincing everyone how true he has remained to the spirit of the books...From all that I have read, 98% of viewers adore TTT... and sadly I have ended up in the 2% that did notI loved FOTR, but where that film simply veered off the road of the text, TTT plummets off the side of the road, down a ravine, takes some untraveled dirt back roads before taking some contrived short cut back to the original text in the film's forced last 1/2 hourThough I know adjustments are always made in adaptations, this latest installment has lost the magic & sheer wonder of FOTR... None of the storytelling elements that made the first film so special are used in TTT... Sources of my frustration: * Choppy editing * Lack of fluidity * Is this movie a CGI showcase to sell new programs to perspective movie makers? * Axing central book events in favor of unecessary sub-plots * Lack of geographical reference (anyone who's read the books knows about the maps -- but what about those who have not read them??) * Uneven pacing * Forced emotional manipulation (instead of the authentic emotions that FOTR produced) * Sacrificing the thematic nuances of Tolkien's writing in favor of cinematic cliches to please a modern audienceI make no claims to being a 'purist' or expert... like I said changes in adaptations are necessary, but man, I half expected stormtroopers to be riding on the wolves of IsengardCan anyone understand what Treebeard is saying?What's with these sudden cockney accents from the orcs - Oi's a-gonna ate yo (Meestah Scroooge/Fawvah Krees-mas --oops wrong movie)Ok - enough, it's done, I said it, it's out in the cosmosI'm praying for ROTKFor the other 98% of you -- please disregard this, you've already been convinced.",Null,5,5,10 October 2003
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," A gem in the heap of garbage called 'American film'
","Without gushing, I think that this is the best film to come out of the US in several years. This is the type of movie which demands repeated viewing, and reveals itself a little each time. I'm surprised that the genius of this film didn't receive more accolades at the time, but I attribute that to the socially acceptable restraints of the mass culture.Absolutely perfect production from top to bottom, makes you laugh out loud... then tears your heart out & puts it back in again. Multi layered & symbolic throughout.Songwriting by Stephen Trask is sublime. But how the hell can a clown like Eminem get an Oscar & this guy was virtually ignored?! Sickening thought. Cameron Mitchell must have been born for this part... a brave & charismatic perf.This movie achieves everything that 'Velvet Goldmine' (yuck) could not... in a fraction of the time.Anyway, anyone who's got a little freak in them will love this movie. And those who don't 'get it' should be content watching the rest of American mass market trash cinema.",Null,80,110,14 June 2003
