The Incredible Hulk," Best Marvel movie yet!
","This film is amazing! You can actually tell that the director, Edward Norton, and Tim Roth are fans of The Incredible Hulk unlike most Marvel films. The Incredible Hulk is such an underrated comic series, I would probably say Bruce Banner is the one of the most emotionally intriguing characters in Marvel. So what is your favorite Marvel film to date? X-Men? Spider-man? Iron Man? Well I'm a fan of all of those mentioned but I would say that The Incredible Hulk is better than the ones mentioned because it stays true to the comics/TV series. X-Men and Spider-man had lots of problems that I won't get into right now, and several are saying that Iron Man is the best Marvel movie now. Well, Iron Man may perhaps be the most 'fun' film, but due to The Incredible Hulk having more interesting characters, great cinematography, and a great score make this an epic masterpiece. There are so many things in the film that made my inner-nerd geek-out, including cameos by the late Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno, and Stan Lee. I also loved the use of 'The Lonely Man' and 'Hulk Smash'. The cast was also amazing in this...I believed that Edward Norton was a scientist on the run, that Liv Tyler and him had a past together and believable chemistry. I believed Tim Roth was an aging mercenary that was power-hungry and wanted to find the fountain of youth, and that William Hurt was a corrupt General...but to him Hulk is the bad guy. William Hurt totally gets into character here as always, he doesn't look or sound like himself, crazy.",10,5,8,16 June 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Much worse than expected
","SPOILERS!!!!!!I have been a huge fan of the ALien and Predator films for a long time and have lately been really anticipated for AVP. Then when I saw it I was really disappointed and in my opinion it is the worst film for both of the franchises.From seeing this film gives me another reason to like Paul Anderson much less.I did not like any of the characters at all except for one, and the one that I liked(Bishop) dies! And I thought that was so stupid the Predator teaming up with the human. And the first 2 predators died way too fast! The ending was so stupid with the whole pred/alien thing. And exactly when did the facehugger latch on to the predator?!?! In the previous alien films a facehugger is on you for an hour at the very least and takes several hours for the chestburster to pop out. What were they thinking! Did they even bother to watch any of the other films? Obvisiously not! I could go on ranting for hours. This film will not be liked by the fans which it is supposed to be liked by them,which means this films sucks bad. OVERALL SCORE-2/10",1,0,2,15 August 2004
Casino Royale," Bond fans won't be disappointed!
","This is by far one of the best Bonds ever. The past few films have been very mediocre and the formula to the franchise needed change to restore it. Well, this is exactly what happens in CR. First of all, Craig is amazing. And yes, I was one of the haters of him. But he delivers an amazing performance and we see a side to Bond that we have never seen before. There are so many things changed in this film, compared to previous Bonds. The cool film-noir opening, the gun barrel sequence, awesome titles, great villain, three dimensional bond girls, M has more character, no more cheesy CGI action scenes, cool cars, great one-liners, cool twists...basically the entire movie is perfect. So go see this film and you shouldn't be disappointed. If you have any complaints I'd like to here 'em plz. So far the only minor one that I've heard is the title theme and the running time. The title theme is actually pretty good...it's been five films ago since a male sang..about time. The theme also plays well into the well as a score. It gives you that feel of the older bonds. As for the running time, I was completely intrigued throughout the whole film. No more boring, unnecessary scenes. Nothing from the film should have been trimmed down the slightest bit. This is one of the best films of the year (its in my top 3) so plz go see it now1",10,1,3,19 November 2006
