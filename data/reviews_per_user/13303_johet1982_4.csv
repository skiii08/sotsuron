E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. IS ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER MADE.
",This film still makes me cry today. Words cannot describe how much I love this film. The music just sweeps me away. The film brings me to the summer of 1982 when I saw E.T. about 10 times in the movie theater.IT's a great family film ranking up there with the 'Wizard of oz.' RATING 10/10,10,1,2,15 December 2003
A Star Is Born," A Star is Epic
","This film is amazing from beginning to the end. A movie that is so heartbreakingly beautiful. The performances by Gaga@Cooper were so real and down to earth. Every scene with them was so good. The rest of the cast did a great job too. The soundtrack is something I can't stop listening to every day. I rate this: 10/10 ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
I highly recommend this amazing film.ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽ¥ðŸ“½ðŸ™‚",10,1,2,29 October 2018
Flashdance," WHAT A FEELING!!!! A GREAT FILM!!!!
",I'll never forget this film;It came out a month before I graduated High school.The music influenced the class of '83'. 'What a feeling'and the song 'maniac' dominated the radio air waves.'FlashDance had many emotional scenes and'Jennifer beals' did a great job. The critics said it was like an MTV video. SO WHAT? I LOVE MUSIC VIDEOS. THIS MOVIE VIDEO HAS ONE DIFFERENCE; IT MADE YOU FEEL AS WELL AS DANCE. 10/10,10,3,5,28 January 2003
Titanic," THE BEST FILM I'VE EVER SEEN; SO SAD YET SO BEAUTIFUL.
","This film Is the best film I've ever seen. It deserved the 11-Academy awards and the 1.8 billion dollars it earned world wide. It is so sad yet so beautiful. James Horner's score is a masterpiece. James Cameron showed us that the heart can go on after losing someone we love.Jack and Rose(DiCaprio,Winslet)Are two great film characters that will go down in movie history. THIS FILM IS UP THERE WITH 'GONE WITH THE WIND'.IT WAS TRULY A MOVING EXPERIENCE!!!!!! 10/10",10,1,3,25 January 2003
