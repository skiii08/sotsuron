The Expendables 2," The Perfect amount of carnage and mayhem for anyone who is looking for that R rated action flick this year.
","Back in 2008 Sylverster Stallone had a pretty solid and great idea. To bring together the best action starts of the past decade and through them together in one mega action flick-and it wasn't all that great. All that however is changed in the sequel which is actually far superior to the first movie, and just might be one of the best action movies to grace the screen in years.The plot is a simple one (but with a movie like this who really is expecting an Oscar contender) When the Expendables go to retrieve a computer locked in a CIA safe they get more than they bargained for when their newest team member is shot and killed by a terrorist organization who plans to use the computer to discover the largest deposit of uranium in the world.Thats it, plain and simple, and thats all the movie needs. The action is amped up and there is plenty of gore to be had. Most of the action films lately have be PG-13 superhero movies, so if you have been waiting for a Die Hard action film then look no further.My last complaint about the first movie was than Jean Claude Van Damm was no where to be seen (since he is my favourite action star) well he gets the full treatment in this movie as the film main antagonist! It looks like he was having allot of fun with it too, and a great cameo by Chuck Noris (they even have him say his own Chuck Noris joke) this movie is highly entertaining.Great Jokes, awesome action, and a great chance to see some start of old kick ass I give this movie a 8/10",8,2,4,19 September 2012
Pacific Rim," It's good but it not great
","I remember when this movie was first announced, as an anime/manga/kaiju/Del Toro fan I was hyped and excited. As the movie started to near release my excitement grew, seeing the robots and hints at the chaos in the Kaiju's wake were enough to make me feel like a little kid again watching my Godzilla movies. Even reviews were stellar for the movie and I thought it was to good to be true......and it was This movie is a good ride but it is NOT the great and awesome movie everyone is making it out to be. I understand supporting a film because it has a new fresh idea for Hollywood but that does not give a movie a free pass because this movie could have been allot better. Now if you liked the movie thats fine but I really wanted to love this movie and I only found my self just liking it.Sure the plot is as thin as nails but thats to be expected and I am not holding that against this movie. Many Kaiju films have horrible plots and the reason you watch those movies is to see giant monsters destroying cities. Now this movie has great visual effects and it looks amazing. The 3-D is the best I've seen since Avatar but the action scenes were missing something, in fact the whole movie seemed to be almost reaching the peak of amazement but never reached it, so for the whole movie I felt unfulfilled and the movie felt like it was missing something crucial.Now I did enjoy the movie it started out strong with an amazing opening sequence but as the movie reached the middle point it started to bog down. The action sequences didn't excite me or pump me up like when I saw Man of Steel or the Avengers. I wanted to leave the theatre wanting to run right back in to see it again. I found myself not really caring if I did see it again This has been a very strange summer, each big blockbuster has divided audiences and fans alike. Go see the movie for your self and see if you like it because allot of people were blown away. I just think the movie could have used allot more something in it because it was just a bland film in my eyes.I didn't hate Pacific Rim I did enjoy myself I just expected so much more I'll see it again when it comes out on bluray and I'll probably buy it when the price drops.",6,0,4,17 July 2013
The Conjuring," Not the best horror movie in 30 years but it is a push in the right direction
","Every time a new horror movie comes out it is either labelled as a) based on a true story or b) the scariest film in thirty years I am sorry but although this is actually somewhat based on a true story it is not the scariest movie in thirty years, that belongs to a different film entirely but it's all a matter of opinion and we are here to talk about the Conjuring. There is no need to talk about the plot because I am sure you have heard/seen it hundreds of times already (especially within the last five years) What the Conjuring does do effectively is spin a fine tale of horror something that most horror movies these days have forgotten to do. The characters that inhabit this god forsaken house are the pillar to what will make the movie work for anyone going to see it, if they fall flat then you will most likely not care.Most of the scares are things you have seen before but that is to be expected since this movie has been done hundreds of times just under a different coat of paint.The Conjuring is a step in the right direction for the genre for now and is a better piece than Insidious. James Wan can film anything and make it look beautiful and is able to weave a sense of dread from the moment the movie starts.Go see it for yourself instead of watching any trailers (really don't watch them they spoiled the movie) its not that scary but it is some good entertainment for a summer horror flick.",7,1,3,30 July 2013
Prometheus," I don't understand all the hate that this movie is getting
","Ridley Scott is my favourite director, and like so many others I have been eagerly awaiting his return to Science Fiction. Prometheus offered a chance for Ridley to return to the genre he was best at. Of course I heard he was to direct an ALIEN prequel when it was first announced, and I was excited, but when i heard it was turning into its own unique project, well lets just say that I couldn't help but jump in excitement.The wait has been long but Prometheus has finally landed in theatres world wide, and for some reason people seem to want to bash this movie. Perhaps its because it is not doing the common Hollywood prequel and is trying to be something unique and different. I totally accept the fact that they want this movie to stand out and be different.I thought the story was engaging enough to keep me interested in the movie, the special effects and camera work were spectacular, but that is now expected from a Scott film. I found the acting to be great as well, Michael Fassbender was the star of the movie, his job at playing David will be one of the things that many people will talk about after watching the movie. Some people have been complaining that some characters were really wooden and just fodder for the film. Well of course they are! I completely expected the crew to be expendable and I enjoyed watching their horrific fates.The music also fit the film as well, I think the major problem people have with the soundtrack is that they think Prometheus is supposed to be just a strait horror movie. The majority of Prometheus is an adventure film, and i think the soundtrack fit the feel of an grand journey and a almost ancient and god like feel to it. In the end see the movie for you're self, it truly is an amazing work of film.",8,2,6,9 June 2012
