The Blair Witch Project," Neat idea, not so neat movie.
","Three student filmmakers are filming a documentary about a legendary witch who may be responsible for the disappearance of children throughout the century in Maryland. The students ask the locals about the legend, in the film's best scenes, and then head into the haunted woods to investigate, but they are never seen again. The only thing left behind is this footage that they shot during their investigation. At least, that is what the filmmakers want us to believe in this cheaply shot, extremely monotonous effort. The films consists of ad-libbed footage from the actors who play the students and the result is a slightly creepy pseudo-documentary. The three young actors are believable, but the film gets fairly dull throughout, especially in the daylight scenes. The film is probably a better idea than film.",5,0,2,22 May 2000
Citizen Kane," Most certainly one of Hollywood's greatest...
","'Rosebud' is the mournful, deathbed utterance of Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles). 'Can one word explain a man?' one reporter asks. This is what reporters intend to find out. The film is a jigsaw puzzle of Kane's life assembled piece by piece by those who 'knew' him best so that everyone might learn what or who 'Rosebud' is. The film's opening seems to suggest that this investigative intrusion into his personal past is not a place that should be trespassed upon. The cast is brilliant, especially Welles as the unfulfilled newspaper mogul. The story, scripted by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Welles, owes as much to the life of Welles himself as it does to yellow journalist William Randolph Hearst, its most obvious model. The film remains fascinating from start to finish, in viewing after viewing, in this, Welles' directorial debut. It is filled with innovative technique, symbolism, and powerful meaning and has solidified its place as one of the true masterpieces of cinema.",10,0,1,3 June 2000
12 Angry Men," 12 angry men: millions of happy viewers...
","Henry Fonda stars in this electrifying drama that takes place almost entirely in a closed jury room. A teenager is on trial for the murder of his father and will get the chair if found guilty. The jury takes an early vote and it seems that Fonda is stands alone in voting 'not guilty.' Now, he has the challenge of trying to win the others over to his side. A tight script and an explosive performance by Lee J. Cobb make this a true classic. Fonda is great as the mild-mannered protagonist to Cobb's fiery antagonist. A great cast fills out the rest of the jury, including John Fiedler, a very young Jack Klugman and Jack Warden, Robert Webber, E.G. Marshall, and Martin Balsam as the head juror.",10,0,1,26 May 2000
The Sixth Sense," I promise not to give away the surprise...
","The title of this creepy thriller refers to a young boy's ability to see ghosts and to communicate with them. The boy, Haley Joel Osment, reveals his secret to no one, and suffers much ridicule and feelings of loneliness due to his seemingly odd behavior. Bruce Willis plays a child psychiatrist who tries to find out what is wrong with him and finally having earned the boy's trust, the youngster tells his haunting secret. The film offers and eerie score, many scares, and some brilliant story developments that will make the viewer rethink the many assumptions that they normally make when watching a film. Not many films have ever had that power.",9,0,0,1 June 2000
Aladdin," Disney does it again!
","Disney's animation team proved that 'Beauty and the Beast' was no fluke in this comedic gem full of adventure.  Aladdin is a street urchin who gets by on what little he can steal. One day he runs into the Princess, who is in disguise, and falls hard for her.  He discovers an old lamp and to his surprise, a genie voiced by Robin Williams pops out.  Williams is in rare form as Disney seems to have let him do whatever he wants, which fits since it is a genie who has been bottled up for so long.  He is in rare form as his genie seems to be doing a stand-up routine throughout the film, one that the parents can enjoy as much as the kids.",9,1,2,18 May 2000
Gladiator," It's been a long time coming, but finally another gladiator flick hits the big screen!
","Director Ridley Scott brings this blockbuster epic tale of ancient Rome to a modern audience.  Russell Crowe plays the general to Marcus Aurelius Caesar, Richard Harris is the emperor, who defeats the Germanian army.  In the aftermath, Caesar dies of 'mysterious' causes and his son, Joaquin Phoenix, takes the crown.  He orders Crowe to be executed, but Crowe escapes, only to be trained by Oliver Reed as an arena gladiator.  Crowe becomes a favorite of the bloodthirsty crowds by the time that Phoenix learns of his escape. Soon, Phoenix and Crowe will have to come across one another's path. The film has great flavor for the period and solid acting and good computer enhanced effects, but the battle scenes are too often done in a stylized, close-up manner, which makes it difficult to discern exactly what is happening.  Sadly, Reed died during the filming and, thus, this is his final film.",7,0,0,18 May 2000
