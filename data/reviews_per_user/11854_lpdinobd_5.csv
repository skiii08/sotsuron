The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," HorseCrap
",I do not like this movie there is just a bunch of moments that make the film not enjoyable. the bunker scene goes on for too long as does many scenes in the film.The main problem with it is that it just throws exposition after exposition at you just to try and to help you understand the incoherent mess that is the story.The music and the dialogue makes me feel tired which is something a film especially a action film like this should not have to do. If you like the film you may enjoy this but even though its competent I can't enjoy this film in paticular.,2,0,1,14 October 2018
Justice League," I feel like falling asleep during this film
","Let me just think of the process of this film getting made
We will take all these iconic characters
Slap a bunch of CGI on it that looks like it was from Independence day 
Cast People who can't act to save their lives
Have a incompetent director
Have jokes that make no sense
Finally tying it all up with the FREAKING SLOW MO CAM
and call it a day
I had to walk out 50 minutes into the film because I was so tired,I was barely paying attention to the film.It was like it took the Bad aspects of Wonder Woman and the Bad aspects of BVS and put it in this monstrosity.I imagine the only people who like it are fans.But oh no THE SLOW MO CAM IS BACK,I don't know about you but I don't understand why DC is using the Slow Mo Cam in all of their films,It just drags out the action scenes and make the film more tedious.(Also just saying to those comic book fans out there they didn't even include the entire justice league)",1,2,4,14 March 2018
Face_Off," I shall like this film for hours
","I love this film to death I personally think this is all time CLASSIC action movies.The action is fantastic and the dialogue is insane.But I kind of like that about the movie.I personally refer to it as a popcorn movie,sure it's cheesy in some parts but you can sit down with a nice bowl of popcorn and just laugh of how corny it is. I consider this a so bad it's AMAZING action movie.",10,0,1,14 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Hate Behind this Film is stupid
","I believe that this is the best Star Wars movie.This is coming from someone who is not a fan of Star Wars I loved the Fan service and the ending was good and wrapped up Luke's story Nicely.Though the writing is sometimes boring and honestly I never liked the fact that they killed Harrison Ford but Carrie Fisher still remained(I say this because she's dead in real life).The things I hate about the film the most is that the pacing is slow and the 2 plots switch way to often.The Pacing starts off fast with a high chase Space scene though then almost Nothing happens for most of the film until actual Charcter development happened which doesn't happen until around the second act.Speaking off which the two plots in the film are destroying a Bad spaceship belonging to the villains and Rey learning from Luke.I feel that the plot switch way to often and we can't really appreciate each individual scene.But the thing I truly hate about this movie is the hate behind it.Some people say this film is better than the Prequels.THE PREQUELS,which even though I don't like Star Wars were absolutely TERRIBBLE movies.My final thoughts on the film are Check it out if you want but if your not a big Star Wars fan then I recommend staying away from it.",7,2,20,24 June 2018
Incredibles 2," I don't get it
","I personally don't understand why people love this movie as much as they do.Personally I was incredibly disappointed,the film was boring for me unlike the original the film I admit is competent but it is so competent it makes me not like it. I wanted to like it but the story was predictable the twist was blantently obvious and they did nothing with the new characters like I said I wanted to like the film but it ended up just boring me and disappointing me",3,2,10,14 October 2018
