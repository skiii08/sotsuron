Alien 3," After the misfire of Aliens we get back on track with Alien 3
",The folly of ALIENS fans is that they seem to not be able to digest horror in a horror franchise. This is horror - not Bedknobs and Broomsticks. They prefer their horror films to be mindless shoot 'em ups with cool weaponry being wielded by tough people with big muscles greasing each other up. ALIENS could have starred Sylvester Stallone. They also cannot seem to be able to accept that in horror films - horrible things happen (Gasp!) Thank goodness David Fincher's bleak masterpiece reinstated the franchise to its horror roots. We should rejoice the fact that Newt and Hicks were slaughtered. This is horror - not Mary Poppins. We should celebrate Ripley's demise. This is horror - not Pollyanna. I suppose ALIENS fans would have preferred Ripley to lose her glass slipper in Alien 3 only to have Hicks find it and return it to her at the end of the film? Perhaps they could both then get married in the prison colony with Newt as the bridesmaid? A host of bald men looking on with big smiles on their faces? Brian Glover catches the bouquet? The mindless action fest ALIENS with its happy Disney ending is the black sheep of the original trilogy.,10,3,8,15 October 2016
Aliens," A mindless shoot' em up.
","If only ALIENS were a horror movie as Alien and its true sequel Alien³ are. This mindless shoot 'em up with its TV formatted aspect ratio is clearly the black sheep of the original trilogy. It is enjoyable, yes - but as an ALIEN film it definitely doesn't cut it. Perhaps they should have given the project to Stallone or Schwarzenegger and waited until they had drawn up a script that would have fitted the criteria set by the first movie. We have James Cameron to blame for clearly not understanding that classy horror films should not be about macho gun wielding Rambo antics and people admiring and greasing up each others muscles. Thank goodness Alien³ restored the franchise to its bleak and artistic horror roots.",1,12,27,15 October 2016
Blade Runner," Everything you thought you knew about Blade Runner is wrong.
","Clearly, Gaff was psychic. How else would he know which rooftop Deckard was on in the climax? How else would he know about Deckard's dream? His origami was his presentation of the reading he has received from his subject's mind. How did he know Deckard was chicken? He read his mind. But only when Deckard was present. How did he know Deckard was horny? He read his mind. But only when Deckard was present. His final origami statement - the unicorn - is the result of finally being able to see Deckard's unicorn thoughts - but it only came to him once he was in Deckard's apartment. It took him longer to present his origami this time because Deckard was not in Gaff's company when he had the dream. You see? He left the unicorn to let Deckard know that he had succeeded in reading his mind for the last time and he is now free to leave with Rachael. Indeed, when Deckard picks up the origami unicorn , we can see him nodding. He is essentially saying 'Well done, Gaff. You got it right. You took your time on this occasion but you did get it right.' In an outtake - he claims Deckard 'is a deep one.' This indicates he is harder to mind read than the cases that he is used to. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the government psychic, Gaff.NOW, ONTO MY NEXT ANALYSIS: THERE ARE NO REPLICANTS IN THIS FILM.The Tyrell Corporation is simply an arm of the government who pretend to create artificial beings and press upon the less important members of society that they are, indeed, a creation of Tyrell to keep them in their place - cleaning toilets and brushing up etc... The ultimate form of pleb control. Submissive humans who think they are replicant and remain submissive for fear of being switched off by the powers that be. Clearly the case.",8,1,5,12 October 2016
