The Blair Witch Project," Blair will never let you go
","I remember back in 1999, this film was marketed as a real event and that the events you were seeing were true and these people have actually disappeared. Of course, that wasn't the case but marketing it this way lured people to go see it, including me. Never have I seen such a film so original, that engaged me, and made me believe that what I was seeing was true since 'Cannibal Holocaust.' It is set in 1994 when a group of three student filmmakers were filming a documentary on a legendary witch known as Blair in Burkittsville, Maryland. As they go deeper into the woods they get lost and every night they hear strange sounds coming from the woods but they can't make what it is or where it comes from. As the days go by, they succumb in desperation as they can't find a way out of the dense woods. But even more horrifying is that someone or something is hunting them.After leaving the theater back in 1999, this movie would just not leave my mind for days. The acting was unbelievable, even more coming from unknown threesome of actors. It was shot in a first person point of view with the actors being the ones holding the camera giving it a new sense of realism, now this wasn't absolutely new style of filming. Cannibal Holocaust was filmed the same way but it hasn't been done in a long time. Also you never see what is hunting them; the movie forces the viewers to use their imagination and to fill in the gabs. Nowadays many movies try to copy the filming style of The Blair Witch but fall short. But what was even more amazing is that this little independent film, with a budget of nearly $30,000, earned over 240 million dollars at the box office. That is something you don't see every day.This film don't have the eye candy and gore other horror films have or elaborate setting or big names, it is simple, creative and extremely effective and I would dare say it is up there with films such as 'The Exorcist' and 'Rosemary's Baby.' This film is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema and I strongly recommended it.",9,2,5,10 April 2012
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Action Packed Zombie Thrill Ride
","Never did I imagine these movies to make it this long, but to my surprise they have and it looks like they will continue. I did like Extinction more than Apocalypse, but even I believed it was the end of the franchise. Then Afterlife comes and, although for me it is not as good as Extinction, it is quite entertaining and it blends a lot of elements and themes used in other zombie movies and media.So Afterlife takes off where Extinction left our survivors on their search for Arcadia, the supposed haven located in Alaska. Alice, in an attempt to once and for all stop the evil Umbrella Corporation, gathers her clone army and attacks the Umbrella HQ in Japan. After losing all her clones in an Akira like nuclear explosion, Alice returns to Alaska in search for her friends and Arcadia, but she only manages to find Claire, which seems to be in a stage of amnesia and no Arcadia. Then she and Claire fly to LA where they find refuge in a large prison complex which is inhabited by other survivors. But outside the prison, there are thousands of zombies tirelessly trying to break in the prison. Alice and the survivor have to figure out a way to escape the prison and make their way to Arcadia before the prison is finally overrun by the living dead.The Resident Evil movies are a far cry from the games or themselves. I did enjoy Afterlife prison idea and there's quite a good amount of zombie action and gore, but it falls flat in terms of story and screenplay. The characters seem too comic-book like and the story doesn't make much sense at times, but there's no denying that this movie is quite a ride and the zombies are ruthless, specially the one that carries a giant sledgehammer. Although Milla Jovovich character, Alice, is not from the game franchise, I think she carries these movies and they wouldn't be the same without her. To this point you can't compare the games and the movies, they are now two different entities that only share the same title. The F/Xs and visuals are great, the photography is excellent, and it has a killer soundtrack.I recommend Resident Evil: Afterlife as what it is; a horror/action/pop-corn movie, nothing more, nothing less. So, if you love zombie movies or anything related to zombies, check it out.",8,1,4,15 March 2012
Sleepy Hollow," Burton's Instant Classic of Horror
","Without a doubt, Tim Burton is an artist. He has proved that when he brought us Batman (1989) and Edward Scissorhands. This time he outdoes himself with Sleepy Hollow. He brings back that Gothic horror from the Hammer Films, but with a fairy tale fell to it. Sleepy Hollow is set in the 1800 and tells the story of Ichabod Crane (played by Jonny Depp), an odd, open minded New York constable who is sent to investigate mysterious murders in a small village known as Sleepy Hollow. Crane relies on weird gadgets and sometimes odd theories to solve crimes, but this time he will face a supernatural force he had never come across, The Dreaded Headless Horseman. This movie is a master piece and has one of the most beautiful set designs I have ever seen. Christopher Walken and Ray Park (Darth Maul) give life to the Headless Horseman. Also, Christopher Lee makes a guest appearance at the beginning of the movie. The plot is great, the cast is phenomenal, and the photography is gorgeous. This movie is among one of my favorite smart and entertaining horror films. If you haven't seen it and you like classic horror film like the Hammer Films productions from the 50s and 60s you will love this one.",10,0,0,10 June 2009
Fast & Furious 6," This series just keeps getting better
","This is one of those rare occasions when a franchise goes from being okay to being absolutely awesome. 12 years ago, I would have never expected this series to make it this far and not only that, to evolve into what it is today. Furious 6 does not pretend to be anything else but a high octane summer action movie and it does it better than any other movie this year so far.In Furious 6 agent Hobbs request the help of Dominic and his crew to find a dangerous mercenary in exchange for full pardon, but also to find Dominic's believed deceased girlfriend, Letty. This movie almost feels like a testosterone 007 movie. The series takes us to Spain and England. The chase sequences are just amazing, the stuns are great, and the cars, well; it's a Fast and Furious film. The acting it's what it is, but the thematic of family and friendship are believable and heartwarming. The main villain this time around is pretty solid and does feel like a true challenge for the protagonists. This movie was so well made and so fun to watch that after watching the surprise revelation at the ending credits I can't wait to see the next one. Furious 6 has it all, action, comedy, women, and a lot of insane cars. This is what true blockbuster movies are all about. I highly recommended.",9,1,2,27 May 2013
Revolutionary Road," Pointless Road
","I just finished watching Revolutionary Road, actually I watch it twice. The story is set in US suburbia, in the post WW2. It enfolds a married couple, the Wheelers, who are in discomfort with their ordinary lives and they decide to do something different. Their plan is to move to Paris and start a new and different life. Winslet plays a 1950s housewife with unaccomplished dreams. She encourages he husband Frank (DiCaprio) to quit his job and sell their home so they can go on this trip. But Frank is more assertive to others opinion, outside their marriage, than of his own wife. For a moment we see them doing well until Frank is offered a better position on his work place and decides to cancel their plans. I understand the premise of the story and Winslet character's desperation to get out of her, so called boring life. What I didn't get was her true motivations. I have never read the book and perhaps I never will, but the movie doesn't really develop why she is so into going to France and leaving everything behind. It's obvious, they are not happy and it's clear from the beginning of the movie where their arguments and fighting become clich√© throughout the entire movie. The plot is focused on their depressive state, instead of showing how they got to be so unhappy. Perhaps you might have read this already in other reviews, but my other complains is the lack of character development. Character development is practically inexistent; it leaves you with a lot of whys. The main characters become unlikable and predictable, the only character that I found interesting was John Givings played by Michael Shannon. But other than that, I found the acting was just average, and it wasn't the best work of DiCaprio and Winslet. Story wise there is no concrete plot and in my opinion, it's not strong enough for the viewer to support the main character motive. Anyway, be your own judge, but be warned, this movie is depressing from start to finish.",2,5,9,17 September 2009
I Am Legend," A thousand and one ways on how to destroy New York
","I Am Legend, tells the story of Robert Neville (Played by Will Smith), who is apparently the sole survivor of an epidemic that has wiped out a large percentage of humans and has turned others in to ferocious mutants. The film takes place in New Your City. Neville is immune to the effect of this virus and is trying to find a cure or a vaccine. He survived by making a daily routine and with the companionship of his dog Sam.The Positive: 1. The first half of the movie builds up the atmosphere very well and the images of a desolated New York are very iconic. 2. Will Smiths' acting its really good and you can really feel his sense of lost and loneliness.The Negatives: 1. The movie is to short, a movie like this and with the talent of Will Smith deserved at least two complete hours. 2. There is no explanation of what kind of virus it is or who made it, and why Neville is immune to it. 3. The first half of the film its great but it gets lost by the introduction of Anna, that in my opinion, her character it's totally unnecessary to the film and it doesn't contribute to the story. There is no real story of where she comes from and how she has managed to survive with a little boy for so long. 4. The Zombies/Vampires are totally CGI. They are bold, pale, and scream a lot. The director should have used real actors to portrayed the infected instead of Computer Animated zombies. A very poor choice.5. Another negative is the use of a leading zombie/vampire. 6. Both the ending and the alternated ending leave you with no real satisfaction and no conclusion of the story. I Am Legend had great potential but the director and writers didn't exploit it as they should. Also, it looks like Hollywood just loves to destroy New York, a mean think about it; they have a 1001 ways to destroy it. We have seen it in other films: Planet Of The Apes, King Kong, Cloverfield, Escape From New York, Godzilla, Independence Day, Day After Tomorrow, and now I Am Legend, not to mention Al-Qaeda. It looks like poor old NY its filmmaker's favorite destruction site. I score 5 for the first half, and 0 for the second half.",5,2,3,16 May 2008
Into the Wild," A terrible, depressing movie about self destruction
","I can't believe that this movie is among the top 250 list of IMDb. With so many true stories that are really worthy for a movie, they come with this garbage of a man who just wants to be a bum and how great it is. This movie just embraced the idea of being homeless. Into The Wild, tells the story of Chris McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch), a kid who just graduated from college and decides to go on a trip throughout the wilderness, with no money, no phone, and clearly no responsibilities. On his journey he meets with hippies, criminals and all kinds of trash, which obviously, didn't help Chris develop any sense of responsibility. The writers try to present Chris McCandless as a brilliant college student, who is always reading books about philosophy and nature. In the end he ends up alone, insane, and dead. Sean Penn tries to justify the character actions by portraying a supposedly dysfunctional family. In reality, the character of McCandless is just a spoil brat that just doesn't want to face the realities of life and decides to run away from it. The director tries to enchant the audience by showing visuals of mountains and wilderness but that doesn't hide the fact that this movie is a terrible one. The film massage is clear from the beginning, 'love humans, but love nature more.' What type of nonsense is that? It's amazing what some people will do for nature, but won't even move a muscle to help their peers. The movie is depressing and plain terrible. But if you are the hippie type, hate having to pay the mortgage on time, or don't like to have any responsibilities, well you'll definitely love this movie and even might identify with the character.",1,16,29,20 May 2009
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A pop culture phenomenon
","Perhaps the best science fiction movie ever made. This movie defines sequels as it is know today. The movie goes light years ahead from the first in every way; special effects that to this day even look better those modern sci/fi movies of today. The characters are defined and the saga really begins in this epic story. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Leia suffer difficult and effective changes though out the movie. The introduction of Yoda as the tinny Jedi master was amazing, the former smuggler, and Solo's best friend Lando as a two face allied was perfect. The fearsome and imposing Darth Vader with his deep voice is for me the best performance of James Earl Jones ever. The light saber duel between Luke and Vader was dramatic and surprising. And the revelation 'no, I am your father' it has become a pop culture phenomenon. Empire is the best of all the 6 film succeeding where others have failed.",10,0,0,25 May 2007
