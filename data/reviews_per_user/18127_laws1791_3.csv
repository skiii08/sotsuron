Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Went in basically already disliking the movie...
","...and then I was surprised. My wife had tried to explain it to me, so I thought it was some Burton/Depp movie, and I was thinking 'Here we go again with Johnny Depp...' Then as the movie progressed, and I noticed no Depp, so I let my guard down a bit, which would have been brought down regardless since the movie was very entertaining because of the storyline, time period, and the special effects/choreographed scenes. I hate over-the-top car chase scenes and slow-mo fight scenes (and, yes, vampires, too), but add that to a cool story line with a late 19th-century setting and Abraham Lincoln, and I had a good time that I did not expect!If you take your movies seriously, I would stay home, as you might feel intellectually cheated out of your hard-earned money. I thought it was intelligent, but I am the guy that hates 3D movies, over-the-top special effects, slow-mo fight scenes, vampires, zombies, and story lines done over-and-over-and-over again - all for recycling, but not of movie plots! And maybe this movie did have a recycled storyline...I have no clue!For me, without knowing what the movie was about other than the title, I was thoroughly surprised and had a good time. Laughed a lot, although it's not an outright comedy, but I do like history, and as I will say for the third time, I liked the story!If you are on the middle-of-the-fence, wait until it comes to the 'cheap seats' or DVD.",10,10,16,24 June 2012
Lone Survivor," Love the Book, HATE the movie
","Everything in the movie was somewhat in sync with the book...then as the scene fades to darkness and Luttrell is rescued, my jaw just dropped as to the final events of the movie. Please, please, please read the book and get the facts straight from Luttrell, not Hollywood. There was no violent ending to Luttrell's rescue as it was depicted in the final scenes of the movie. Much respect to the true heroes who died during Operation Redwing, but I do not have any respect for Hollywood and their poor portrayal of a great story of survivalism and heroism. Again, please, please, please read the book. 'Based on a True Story' movies are not always great examples of what actually happened.",1,8,16,26 January 2014
Prometheus," Terrible...Boring Topic, but I can see where those who love this stuff will love this movie
","The trailer was kind of annoying for one, but the movie was just awful. For one, unlike most people it seems, I can't take it seriously. When I hear 'thought-provoking' and 'plausible' it's as annoying as I thought the trailer was. And two, as far as entertainment is concerned, I can be entertained by some seriously bad films, but I wish time machines were real so I could go back and not see this! However, I will admit that I am not really a 'sci-fi' kind of guy. Although not for me, if you love this kind of stuff you will appreciate the fact that the 'aliens' are not that outrageous looking green creature that is totally bizarre, but rather more human-like in an attempt to show, I guess, that 'we' share a genetic lineage...again, not my 'cup-o-tea.'",1,19,31,5 July 2012
