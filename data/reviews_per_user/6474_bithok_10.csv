Raiders of the Lost Ark," Lame
","Most people give this movie a 10 out of 10 because they don't consider the movie but rather how happy they were to discover it as a child but now, in 2005, it has become obviously outdated, the script is quite bad and the acting is even worse. Harrisson Ford obviously should have worked his acting better, which he happily did since that movie. I am sorry I cannot just keep on lying about this movie: this is for your kids but in now way should it be put among masterpieces. IMDb is a web site about movies, not about cult and self-proclaimed nerds or geeks. You have to determine how good is a movie according to artistical criteria, neither to your gregarious instinct nor to your 'attitude'.",4,91,193,4 May 2005
Ed Wood," Decisive
","I love the way Tim Burton turned this loser into a passionate film maker. Ed Wood now appears as an inspired but money-lacking story-teller. He's quite touching and actually makes me feel like it's better to try and film some idea than just slandering other's films. Ed Wood has appeared on my DVD shelf a few weeks ago, it has become a permanent part of my top 10.",8,0,0,16 July 2003
Spider-Man," Disappointingly far from the original thing
","This is not the spiderman which adventures I used to read, 15 to 20 years ago, this is just another american block buster. Despite an outstanding music (you just can't deny Danny Elfman's talent), you will wait a long time until something funny or breathtaking happens... And it won't. This Peter Parker is not half-nerdy as the one I read about was, he spends a long time learning his own skills instead of going out to save lives, he fights against his college friend Flash Thompson while the original one would just hide his powers. He refuses MJ's love at the end while Peter Parker was just dying for her... So what ? They modified the plot, the hero, even Aunt May is not the same kind as in the original books : she's strong and red-blooded while the original one was thin and sweet. Spider-Man is IMHO not DVD-able, I can't risk wasting 2 hours one more time in front of such a bad movie. But if you loved the X-Men movie, you may then adore this one.",2,1,2,11 June 2002
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Too dense
","Though the filmmaking was excellent, and the music... FANTASTIC ! I think the story was too fast. I have not read the book, nor I have read any HP book, BTW, but I think this desserved to last at least 90 more minutes. Many events such as the quidditsch match or HP adoptive family have been neglected. Actually, there were lenghty moments as well, like the bus ballad or Harry flying across the lake but I can accept these part were that lenghty (not long). So, the perfect Harry Potter would be as dense as the second one, as magic as the first (which benefitted from the surprise effect) and as intimate as this one. I also loved the fact it didn't have a real climax but rather soemthing really cleverly put together instead, I won't spoil around but I liked the way Harry could get two views of the same scene. Anyway, it was good enough to get a respectable 7.",7,0,0,1 July 2004
Gandhi," Truely... true !
","This movie deals with issues such as oppression, colonization, and most of all : non-violence in a way that i quite unique. There is much more action in this film as there is in The Matrix which indeed appears monotonous and boring after several times. it is not a matter of watching exploding helicopter but rather hearing and seeing a small poor man making the English shale in their boots after they realize how wrong their Civilization Dogmas are. I guess Gandhi is much underrated as most disturbing films might be. Concerning the actors, Ben Kingsley is actually astonishing and, until I sawthe beginning of this film, then 'Dave', I seriously thought he was around 60 years old. That also goes for the make-up artists. Gandhi is one of my all-time favorites and truely desserves to be broadcasted in School in order to teach children how far from the truth their education leads them.",8,10,16,21 January 2002
The Chorus," Perfect
","200 people were attending this movie in the theater, when the light went back after the movie was finished, nobody had moved, all the eyes were red. When Jean-Baptiste sings, it just takes you by your guts. The story is fantastic, the music is magic, Jugnot is expectedly grandiose... The picture itself is made 'Ã  la' 50s, it's very special but truly desserves the highest awards. I cannot give anything below 10 here. I swear you'll love this movie, if you don't, get back to your pop corn bucket and go and watch that Riddick sh1te, at least you'll get what you desserve....",8,85,119,6 September 2004
Hero," Full
","A wonderful story, beautiful pictures, ballet-esque fights... From the first scene to the last, the authors deploy all their obstination in order to make this movie the masterpiece this indeed is. Forget the puny blockbusters of 2003, should I remember only 5 2003 movies, these would be 'Ying Xiong', 'Catch me if you can', 'Adaptation' 'Chicago', and 'The 25th hour'. I can't wait to view this movie again on my Plasma screen, it has to be the fullest movie experience I ever had.",7,0,0,26 August 2003
The Nightmare Before Christmas," True Magic
","Perfect. Scenario, picture quality, music, anything. But please : don't even try the French speaking version. Prefer the subtitles along with Dany Elfman's singing. OK, I have not seen it for one week. Time to please myself again and again... :-)",7,0,2,5 June 2000
The Matrix," Astounding special effects but...
","The Matrix is an outstanding visual entertainment. However, its plot is quite buggy (scenarists are confused between Watts and Volts, Agents may 'teleport' and 'track' anybody but need to bug Neo to follow him...) and not that original (Stanislas Lem's Futurology Congress, Total Recall, Ghosts in the Shell...) so, well, The Matrix can't be enjoyed more than twice because after that, it will lose its appeal... What a pity...",7,0,0,21 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Awful
","Most people give this movie a 10 out of 10 because they don't consider the movie but rather how happy they were to discover it as a child but now, in 2005, it has become obviously outdated, the script is quite bad and the acting is even worse. Alec Guinness himself asked Lucas to get killed at the end in order to get rid of the awful dialogs and the bad acting. I am sorry I cannot just keep on lying about this movie: this is for your kids but in now way should it be put among masterpieces. IMDb is a web site about movies, not about cult and self-proclaimed nerds or geeks. You have to determine how good is a movie according to artistical criteria, neither to your gregarious instinct nor to your 'attitude'.",3,5,20,4 May 2005
