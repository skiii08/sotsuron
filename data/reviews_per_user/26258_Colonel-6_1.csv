The Blair Witch Project," An Amazing Scare!
","This movie is the scariest movie I have ever seen.  It is brilliantly written, directed, and acted.  The concept is unique and ingenious. Instead of seeing the movie from an outside, third person perspective, we get a first hand look at the footage filmed by the characters themselves.  This effectively puts us in the woods with them.  You don't just watch this movie, you experience it.  You see what the characters see; and you fear what they fear. The trailers for the film and the webpage built my expectations up very high and the movie itself did not let me down.  The tension created by the film was intense, and everyone who attended the screening I saw walked out with looks of shock and exhaustion on their faces.  We all looked as though we had been through some great ordeal together. If you get a chance (and you want to be scared) go see this film!  It's worth it!",10,1,2,30 June 1999
