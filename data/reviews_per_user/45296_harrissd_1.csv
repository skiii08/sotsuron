The Longest Yard," Great movie
",Adam Sandler has the best movies. He is hilarious in this movie along with all of the other actors. I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor. His movies are the type you can watch over and over again and still laugh and love them every time. The professional wrestlers are a nice addition to this full of contact movie. If you like hitting and tackling this is the movie for you! I wasn't bored even for a second and even Nelly played a good role. I rank this right up there with Waterboy and Happy Gilmore which are definitely Adam Sandler classics. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD so I can watch it as much as I have watched all of his other movies. Chris Rock also adds a little spice to the mix and where did they get those huge guys from anyway??!!,9,1,3,28 June 2005
