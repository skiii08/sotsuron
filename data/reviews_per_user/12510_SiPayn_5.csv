The King's Speech," Beautifully acted, a wonderful film
","It is a film that has been hyped as one of those films that wins awards for the people involved and is all very worthy. It is all that and more.All of the leads in the film give wonderful performances, Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as George VI's wife Elizabeth, and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue is delightfully restrained and yet warm, but the film is Colin Firth's. He gives a truly brilliant performance as Bertie, at times warm and gentle, at times driven to anger by frustration, at times tongue tied and scared, and yet human and engaging throughout.I am not ashamed to say I cried a little at the end, and smiled as well. This is a thoughtful, well directed, beautifully acted gem of a film.",9,1,2,11 February 2011
Watchmen," Who will watch Watchmen?
","Firstly I'd like to dwell on the things that I really enjoyed about 300 director, Zack Snyder's epic adaptation of Moore and Gibbons seminal classic novel Watchmen.From the initial brilliant opening montage set to 'The times they are a'changin' by Bob Dylan, Snyder establishes the mode and tone of Watchmen, and manages to convey the feeling of dread that humanity is living under, the threat of nuclear war. The casting for the most part is excellent, the main actors bringing their comic counterparts to life and each of them helps define and convey the deconstructed super hero archetype that they are meant to portray well, and Snyder has remained remarkably faithful to the source material. Visually the film is stunning to look at, and with the notable exception of Hallelujah during Laurie and Dan's shagfest, the score is excellent as well, including some witty touches like a muzak version of 'Everyone wants to rule the World' by Tears for Fears during the assassination attempt on Adrian.It is perhaps this last bit that causes some of the issues that I have with the GN. I will admit as a complete fan-boy of the source material that I couldn't see how one could remain too faith to the GN, but here because of several sub-plots that have been necessarily axed, and Snyder's want to remain as faithful as possible, I as the viewer felt somewhat detached from the viewing experience, rather than being immersed in Watchmen's story. I found myself listening to dialogue lifted from the page, which in the context of other material sounded fine, but with some of the other back story and sub-plots lifted felt forced and clunky.I do think that this detachment will be helped greatly by additional material which will be in the director's cut of the film, which will become available on DVD later this year.Watchmen is a flawed, but ambitious and wonderful attempt to get the source material on screen. The acting is good and in JEH and JDM's cases very very good, and Snyder has delivered the world of Watchmen to our screens brilliantly. I would recommended people see it, but frankly I'd wait for the director's cut which I think will iron out many of the quibbles I had about the film.7.5/10.",8,1,3,9 March 2009
The Usual Suspects," A Modern Noir Myth
","To those who have heard the hype, and are worried that your expectations will not be fulfilled....don't be. Bryan Singer takes a truly masterful Oscar-Winning script by Chris McQuarrie, an ensemble cast of actors, each of who delivers a great performance, and a haunting score by John Ottman and weaves a modern classic.I won't reveal the plot, other than to say that the film is the story of 5 criminals, who meet in a police lineup, and go on a series of crimes, the last of which is a hijack of a boat which contains $91M of cocaine. You are introduced to Keyser Soze, a master criminal who pulls the strings of the 5 suspects, through an associate, a lawyer named Kobayashi (played with quiet menace by Pete Postlethwaite), and forces them to do the last crime. Its told in flashback, through the eyes of Roger 'Verbal' Kint, who is being interrogated by DEA agent Dave Kujan, played by the Oscar winning Kevin Spacey (Best Supporting Actor for this role) and the always excellent Chazz Palminteri. As more and more information is revealed, more and more layers of deception and trickery are revealed, until the final revelation in the last few minutes of the film.Many people rave about the surprise ending, the twist in the tale. I loved it and didn't feel at all cheated. In fact the more one thinks about the back story and connecting the dots together, the more one realises how carefully and intelligently the script was put together.This is a modern classic, that will rank along side other great pieces of storytelling. One can watch it many times and still get something from it each time, how many films can you say that about? 10/10",10,0,2,31 October 2005
The Dark Knight," In Brightest Day, In Darkest Night........
","Where to begin? Well probably with Batman Begins' last scene and a Joker playing card. From this moment on, most fanboys (and I include myself amongst this number) have been frothing at the mouth at the prospect of a sequel. Three years later, Christopher Nolan and his brother, have delivered a script, and Nolan has helmed a film which transcends the limitations of the genre that it is nominally in.From the opening scene of a daring bank robbery executed in broad daylight, introducing us to the Joker, which was obviously inspired by Michael Mann's Heat, to the unexpected and dark ending, the film is relentlessly paced and never lets up. Whilst there are small touched of humour here and there in the film, primarily supplied by Alfred (played with a deft touch by Michael Caine) and the Joker (in an iconic performance by Heath Ledger, more of which later).For those wanting nothing more than a rattling good 'superhero movie', there are more than enough action set pieces, as Nolan has become more assured behind the camera shooting action, but there is so much more here than simple action.The main story arc of the film is Harvey Dent's (played by a very good Aaron Eckhart), whose descend from grace informs the action. Gary Oldman is wonderful as 'everyman' Jim Gordon, one of the few good policemen in a corrupt force, and the rest of the cast is very good, including Maggie Gyllenhall as Rachel Dawes.But the strength of the film is carried on the backs of the two primary characters, Heath Ledger's Joker, a sado-masochistic, psychotic, sociopathic killer with no limits, no boundaries, no rules and Christian Bale's Batman for whom structure and order are all.Its a huge shame that Ledger will never get a chance to reprise the role, since in my opinion it is destined to become iconic, like Vader or Lector. But Bale's turn as both Bruce Wayne and Batman is excellent as well, and he fully makes us believe in Batman.The dialogue is often witty and intelligent, and always serves to drive the plot forward, without sacrificing character development for any of the major characters along the way. So far I have only seen the film once, but am planning to go again today.Its difficult to call a film a classic of its type or a masterpiece so quickly after the film's original release. However, if I was tempted to do so, this would be one of the very very few films I would consider calling a classic, and perhaps even a masterpiece....",10,2,5,25 July 2008
Casino Royale," A very good reboot to the franchise
","First of all, lets just put an end to the Daniel Craig discussion. Anyone who has seen Casino Royale will tell you that Craig makes an excellent Bond. A darker, more gritty Bond to be sure, but given that this is a reboot of the franchise, he has taken the role and made it his own. They took the opportunity to reintroduce some of the classic Bond elements like the DB5 and the opening gun barrel shot, but do not allow themselves to be distracted from the plot.Mads Mikkelsen makes an excellent villain, and Eva Green is lovely as Vesper Lynd. The movie trots along at an agreeable speed, so that you hardly notice the over 2hrs running time. A classic Bond for the 21st century, and with Craig as everyone's favourite spy I have hope for the continuation of the series.****/*****",9,2,5,20 November 2006
