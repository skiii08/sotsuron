Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," No story line: Great for TV; not quite good enough for a movie
","I'm a fan of Da Ali G show and find the humor and approach amazingly funny and at time eye opening. It's brilliant for TV or youtube. Put on the big screen, I thought the material was not quite good enough. After reflecting on that opinion for a while, I have the reason -- no plot or story line. The antics are funny but to create a great MOVIE there needs to be an underlying structure with more strength than the current script that appears thrown together in 5 minutes. Look at some of the best comedies (e.g., The Great Dictator, The Incredibles, Mony Python, Dumb and Dumber) -- they all have crazy antics that make them laugh out funny - BUT they also have some pretty solid writing behind them. The character Borat could have been developed to something beyond a vehicle for getting reactions.Bottom line: Wait for the rental version",5,14,27,20 November 2006
