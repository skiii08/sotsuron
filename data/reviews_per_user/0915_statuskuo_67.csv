Blade Runner 2049," Huh?
","I agree with Rutger Hauer in his assessment that this movie didn't need to be made. To be this long is a travesty of the mystery that brought on the original. A humanistic question that didn't need to be answered. We have a lifespan...we are going to die.In the wake of Ridley Scott treading over old and unused imagery and ideas (along with Hampton Fancher's cantankerous insistence of story before David Peoples bend it to Scott's will) this is the shadow of the original punk neon-rock music video film noir. Instead, it's a tiresome Max Fischer play on what was cool about the first one.Lonely and alone, with wet smoky streets...check. The soul provided by a sad android story...GONE. I assume most critics will not truly criticize for the fact that they don't want to be on that same train that re-assessed 80's 'Blade Runner' and had to choke on Scott's self-righteousness. The original derailed as well and was the accidental hit it is now. Fanboy cries of sequel maybe gutted what was once a masterpiece into a cash grab of epic boring pursuits. By the way, long lingering shots isn't meditative or artistic or thought-provoking, it's pretentious and dumb. Even Scott knew that from the beginning. As Denis Villanueva can do no wrong in the eyes of modern day streaming vid. Guess what? 'The Arrival' was dull too. He's a dull movie maker. BUT...this society we've crafted today enjoys mistaking slow with drama.Here we are again, Scott revisiting his past ghosts but having some French-Canadian d-bag do his dirty work. Next up...'Thelma & Louise 2: Breaking Bad Got Nuthin' On them.' Work out your own personal issues elsewhere. Dull and uninspired.",3,29,65,6 October 2017
Blade Runner 2049," Plastic Worlds
","There's been a ton of talk why this movie was ever made. I'll focus on the real issue. Roger Deakins' poorly shot project which eventually earned him an Academy is possibly the most laughable part.
It looks a) like plastic b) too bright
In what universe does Los Angeles in 2049 look like a hermetically sealed lab? Answer, one that is attempting to get as far away from the original as possible. Though I do hold 1982 version in the same holy temple that the director Denis Villenuve supposedly does, his vision of the dystopian future is somehow...flat.
Also, I do have respect for Ryan Gosling, but somehow he is way too baby faced to be a grizzled hard boiled replicant assassin replicant. Yes, that's what he is. But he also has implanted memories that make him question if he is one. They don't leave that a mystery.
Also mis-casted...Robin Wright. Yes, I get she's suppose to be tough, but there was no reason M. Emmet Walsh could not have played this role MUCH better. Aside from the fact that no one probably remembers him. Even better. Wright plays the captain as a stiff hag who feels uncomfortable using swear words.
Yes, and Jared Leto. Ugh. Does this guy's smug face seem phony in anything he does. Hollywood still wants him to be something. He's not. Never will be. His popularity should be reserved for...uh...teeny boppers.
A total mess that even Harrison Ford nor Sean Young can save. Specifically how they dispense with the rebirth of Rachael. Rather gruesome and unnecessary. This one leaves you truly empty. A total gut punch.",3,4,10,2 January 2019
First Man," An Achievement That Is Beyond Chazelle's Years
","Little is known of astronaut Neil Armstrong's personal life. He was a very introverted person whom we almost could assume suffered from Asperger's. A quiet savant who probably wasn't that much fun at parties. This is why the accomplishment of his life far outweighs the ending that we've all seen. The first man to ever step on the moon. Conspiratorial nutjobs out there claim it never happened, so be it. The other nutjobs think that not including the planting of the flag was a deal breaker. Guess what? The flag is on the moon in the film as is MANY instances where American flags are flown around. Universal wasn't going to allow patriotism to not go unnoticed from one of the most patriotic men in America.
That said, the true accomplishment is to make someone so milquetoast into someone who is ridiculously interesting. A lot of inner turmoil exists on Ryan Gosling's face, which has now been a running gag for a lot of critics. He never emotes. And you get that here too. But, it makes sense for him as Armstrong as you can tell, he wasn't an emotional person. Much has also been seen of Armstrong as an arms length guy which belies his accomplishments. It may be that 'The Right Stuff' was the quintessential astronauts movie, this is the ultimate astronaut film.
I HIGHLY recommend this film, in that it puts you into the seat of these guys who are about to have the equivalent of an atom bomb explode underneath them. EVERYTHING about this film drives the essence of the time and the claustrophobia one feels inside. Tight quarters where you hear every creak and groan of a metal beast thrusting into the sky. It is a visceral experience that you feel more than you can comprehend. Without being a simulator, I suspect this is pretty accurate. The turmoil that Armstrong does feel at the loss of his daughter...you sense it. And there are many moments when you feel it really hit the inside of your heart. A man who tries desperately to feel so little feels so much. An awesome achievement from someone so young as director Damien Chazelle. He is in the same league as Spielberg or Abrams.",8,0,1,2 November 2018
Changeling," Heart Wrenching
","I think we rarely see this decade portrayed as having hideous monsters existing in it. Something quaint and innocent about those times. Simple. Until the violence enters into your life. You can't imagine the unspeakable pain that is ripped from you when the truth comes to the surface.Angeline Jolie is fantastic in this film. Best I've ever seen. She morphs into the role without her glamour, seamlessly. You can feel the frustration in her eyes. The pain she suffers is within her hunched over body language. She's a distraught mom and plays it perfectly. I think Malkovich was completely underrated in this flick. He plays a pastor who is clearly fed up with police corruption. You don't know what they've done to him in the past, but you feel he's on a crusade.You feel that his lost cut deep in the past. And he seemed to relish in being a blustery fire-n-brimstone defender of justice.Eastwood's direction, as usual, is very low-key. He gives you the era without making it flashy. I LOVED the production design on this movie. Every corner made you feel like your were enveloped by this world. An amazing feat when you consider how much was done in-camera. Beautiful cinematography. Just an amazing film.This movie tops my 20 best.",8,1,2,7 March 2014
The Equalizer," Revenge Is A Dish Best Served Denzel
","No one, and I mean NO ONE, does revenge like Denzel Washington. And when he's a man on fire, you get giddy with expectation on his killing sprees. Especially if they're cartoonish bad guys. A video game come alive, this movie is FUN. I grew up with the original t.v. series...and the update is nice. It is stripped of pure camp and gone the way of most Denzel movies. He's the best of the best with a dark past. If you haven't gotten enough of this, watch this flick. It's a LOT of the same, but still worthwhile time waster.Antoine Fuqua again proves he has a very sympathetic ear to the streets. Meaning, he likes the percentage of people who are always getting screwed in life. I like that. I like that theme. And I like there is someone who doesn't wear a cape or have superpowers that have been bestowed on them due to gamma rays or whatever. It's just a man who was upset. Nothing wrong in that. If you spend too much time on the logic, then screw you...this movie isn't your cup of tea. Go watch some British BBC spy movie that gives you every dull detail of its inception. This is good ol' fashion American butt-whipping. Fun.",7,0,4,20 December 2014
Child 44," Discover This Movie
","This is going to be one of those movies that will be discovered years later. Because it's fascinating and so wonderfully constructed, I understand why it wasn't a crowd-pleaser up front.You can read the synopsis for the story, I won't bore you with redundancy.The movie is something to marvel at. The intricacies of the secret world the Soviet union lived under after the war, is debatable. But, the point was to get the paranoia sense across. Who cares if it were the Soviets. It could've been a future society that police our words and thoughts. Whatever the case, the tale weaves in between who is good and who is bad and what it means to hold the moral high ground when a disturbing crime is committed. How we, as humans, deal with our own government when it does overwhelm us with logic flaws. This beautiful movie will be something like 'Enemies At The Gates' A tough angry dirty movie, which people will wonder why it didn't do better.Go seek this movie out on a slow cold night. It's a good one.",7,0,3,11 January 2016
It," Dumb Beyond Belief
","I pity this society. Because they would champion this stupid adaption of Stephen King's novel over the mini-series. I'm trying to figure out if this is dumb or stupid. Dumb implies they purposely ignored the source material and went for...a dusting of the heart of what made the novel so great. Here's a hint to these retards who made this...it isn't kids swearing like morons. Nor was it a decidedly forceful creep like Pennywise. How stupid do you think children are that they wouldn't see a dumb dead-eyed clown in a sewer and reach in? Here's what made the miniseries so much better...he was a playful clown. This one is a creep. It's not fun at all. Tim Curry was legendary in this role, this dunce couldn't hold a clown shoe to Curry.God, I hate this movie. Here's another thing...how stupid are kids that split up...in a house they are afraid of entering in the first place. Also, the town is suppose to be haunted by this tragedy. Saw NONE of that. The miniseries also did something much creepier than a two part money-grab could do...they prefaced the fear by seeing them FIRST as adults. They overlooked the idea that whatever freaked them out as kids back in the day shock them into reality in the present. This will be addressed in the next chapter (laughably, they called this 'Chapter One'...really, idiots? Who did this?). But it's diluted. The miniseries followed the structure of King's book which bounced back and forth which made it infinitely better.People who liked this garbage...too bad you've been conditioned to watch turd. Your brain has been saturated with that 80's feel. Eat ballsack 'Stranger Things.' You're not clever and you're not fun. This is hot hot garbage and society praises mediocrity. Shame on these nitwits. Take the money and run, because you dodged a bullet (yeah, you can tell when the studio lost faith in the project...they made it into an action movie).",1,6,15,23 September 2017
Hereditary," Paid Critics Are Ridiculuous
","Here we go again...
this movie commits two awful sins
1) boring
2) pretentious
Because you're slow, does not mean you're smart or Polanski
It isn't scary either. Wow, is it not scary. It's hilarious actually. The amount of times poor Toni Collette says 'please' is laughable. The girl who has brain damage or is haunted by some old lady ghost...laughable. The camera angles..laughable. In fact, some of the footage looked like poor camcorder footage. It's awful awful, AWFUL. For those who were scared...I pity you. Because you neither know what a horror film is or have never heard of a thing called...a movie.
So what are we left with...sad, overreaching tired tropes of horror films. And those 'smart' critics over at RT...man are you people dumb. The ones who recommend this, you've lost all credibility. Shameful.",1,100,201,9 June 2018
John Wick," It's Okay
","Huh? (in response to the ratings/review) After watching the movie yesterday, I liked it. But the glowing reviews is going a little too far. The character of Wick stems from every western you've seen the past. Lone character whose purpose in life is activated by a terrible tragedy and is slung into action amongst other people similar to him. Yeah, westerns aren't made. This is the closest to it. And it's very effective. And silly at points. And it's fun and definitely worth the watch. I only wonder how terrible the movie industry has become that this will probably set a new 'gold standard.'To be fair I felt the same way about 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' It's overblown hype, and wonder if some of the overwhelming positive reviews isn't coming from paid 'reviewers.' At best, this is a B-level 70's style revenge flick. A lot of bark, and some bite.It's okay.",6,1,19,28 October 2014
World War Z," Nothing New Under The Sun
","Had 'The Walking Dead' not been introduced into the pop culture world, this would be a decent enough movie. As it stands, it is without originality or...purpose. I found myself asking over and over again as to why this was even made. What new information can one gather from the already over-saturated zombie-fied world. Nothing clever.At a certain point, it dawned on me that it seemed wherever Pitt was the zombies seemed to have followed him. I completely tuned out when they (SPOILER ALERT) board an airplane and the zombies were there. I half-expected a passenger jumbo jet fly by and as Pitt looked out the window to see zombie pilots waving at him. Zombie Air logo on the tail. Then he just slowly closes the sunshade. It's that stupid.I sincerely disliked this movie, simply because it was lifeless (ironic enough for a zombie movie). Everyone plays confused. The epidemic seemed somehow...contained and didn't feel the slightest bit real. Probably because it was shot digital and looked terribly digital. I'm sure most people didn't care. There's just nothing new here.",3,0,7,16 September 2013
Us," Don't Think About It Too Hard
","Though finely crafted, and Jordan Peele may be the most promising, definitely most talent bunch from this generation, somehow this movie falls flat, and leaves one with a empty feeling.
Without giving too much away, a clone attempts to murder its 'twin.'
That said, there are more questions than answers, and that doesn't do well for a movie that seems to have a lot to say. Unfortunately, it's really buried in some...higher message about mindless underground population that seems to want the world back. Not sure about that. But it does leave you with an uneasy feeling that the hollowed out. I'm not sure if I'm suppose to be scared, or thrilled or what..but it really is dark humored and...well, sometimes satirizes itself.
Look, Jordan Peele is the best under the age of 50 filmmaker we got now. And you know he loves movies because this film is full of horror movie references, but he nails a true horror movie, only...the BIGGEST let down is that you feel one small detail would make it absolutely perfect. And that is frustrating.",5,2,7,24 March 2019
Knives Out," A Silly Fun Time
","Having endured his own knives out moment with 'Star Wars' fans...director Rian Johnson returns to a fun romp through Agatha Christie route. The mysterious death of a patriarch that reveals family dynamics. At the center is an 'anchor baby' nurse whose adorable naivete of the wealthy actually helps her navigate the bickering within. Though, at times, soaring with twist and turn...if you've seen enough of these, some of it is fairly obvious. But Daniel Craig adds a bit of buoyancy with, what I can only describe as Kentucky Fried Hercule Poirot...it's truly the journey.
A fun evening watch during the holidays with family when fractured politics and nerves get you all down. It holds a mirror to being just a good person without all the bad blood turn to poor choices in life.",8,0,1,12 December 2019
The Irishman," A Study In Real Cinema
","At time 'The Irishman' does get bogged down by the Netflix inspired episodic feel, but this dissection of the inner workings of union and the demise of Jimmy Hoffa at the hands of a close friend is too engaging to leave for a mini-series. It's to be told by the master of cinema, director Martin Scorsese. And, though his recent comments about superhero flicks being the death of real storytelling, which I emphatically agree with, he has earned his right to say so, and in this flick he's proven his skillful craft combining all his efforts from previous mobster flicks. EXCEPT, everyone involved are so subdued and in character, it's hard to remember that Joe Pesci is the rampant hothead in 'GoodFellas' or 'Casino' To be honest, 'The Departed' wasn't worthy of Best Picture. This is. It's a masterful control of pace, storytelling and character idiosyncratic behavior that could've been easily caricature. Instead, we're dealing with a Steven Zaillian script and anchored by incredible faces with incredible pedigree in how people USE to make films. This is the flick we have been waiting for as the trilogy to complete the modern day crime storytelling (I disregard 'Mean Streets' as it's more hood film). In organized crime, most silently nod and people go dead. It's that fast. And the mystery surrounding Hoffa's disappearance is more the MacGuffin of the film than what's at the core. And that is, that friendships within crime don't last long. And that being emboldened to someone through this world does not mean you aren't marked for death. It's comes in many forms. In Robert DeNiro's Frank Sheeran, it is that he is left with the ghosts of people he's wronged. Especially the one who trusted and cared for him the most.Now, is it a perfect film...no. The biggest flaw is that it doesn't present new information about Hoffa's death. It provides his life. And his stubborness, a lot of arrogance and entitlement. As a viewer we understand the dangers of going against organized crime. In Al Pacino's Hoffa, we see a man so blinded by being a somebody, he's willing to continue to bat at a hornet's nest to get the recognition he craves. And it's his own undoing. What this flick really focuses on, is DeNiro's subdued assassin. And through the eyes of his own daughter, he is a monster that lives in the house. A hand grenade whose pin has been pulled and he spends his life wondering how to put it back. His one daughter, Peggy, played by the adult Anna Paquin, witnessed his brutality at an early age. Though low key, he is a pitbull when called upon to do an ugly job. He justifies all his poor decisions as to the welfare of his family. Which, unlike 'GoodFellas' there is a little more class to this than to the thugs of that movie. 'GoodFellas' is a hammer to the teeth, whereas 'The Irishman' plays at the outskirts of crime. The constant bickering which undoes it all has very little to do with people thriving in crime, and more to do with getting respect. It's a brutal grind to get there, since we know the ending.
As always, the camera is at the perfect spot at all times. This mob one, lensed by Rodrigo Prieto, plays it less glamorous. While eye-poppy in old Ektachrome color, it still remains modern. Even with all the vintage production design. Whereas Michael Ballhaus's dark underworld, classic style, this could be the perfect blend between Robert RIchardson's 'Casino' and 'Goodfellas'
It's a great journey, and the biggest compliment I can say is that it made me want to know more about The Irishman.
Thank you for pure cinema Mr. Scorsese!",9,7,15,30 November 2019
Deadpool 2," Throw Things At A Wall
","SPOILERS!!!
There are a lot of things to like about this sequel, however politics aren't one of them. For one thing, referring to a weasely looking guy as Jared Kushner before shooting him in the head and excusing it as an act of revenge for a boy who had been tortured by anti-mutant hospital..defeats the purpose of showing the boy that killing is wrong to fix your life. Since in the future we see the boy grows up to destroy a LOT of life (Hitler anyone?). The point is Deadpool wants his cake and eat it too.
Sorry, the ultra-violent diffused with dark humor is the problem with desensitizing our young society into committing violent crimes. Regardless of studies, because frankly...overstimulation of this level of violence doesn't compute with the simple minded which is what we don't address. It's too touchy to say, SOME Americans are too dumb to differentiate fact from fiction. I grew up with violence on screen, but this takes it to a level where there isn't the consequences.
That said, the comedy also wears thin. Unless you grew up in a specific pop culture bubble, very little of Deadpool humor will land. You also get the sense that he thinks he is already three steps ahead of you before you can accuse him of anything. That smug attitude doesn't work in long form. Being this arrogant and then depending on the audience to root for you to get back to your love interest?...nope.
You just wish his likability didn't feel like a child who is yelling out loud for an adult to pay attention. Yes, it gets tiresome.",3,40,91,29 May 2018
Ready Player One," Based Solely On The Film
","A lot of young people will miss the references, like Mayor Goldie Wilson campaign poster. But this film had to have been a joy to make...
Not sure how he was able to outdo the nostalgia he created, but much like the lame-wad t.v. series that try to ape the era, Spielberg not only created it, he showed them how it's done...again.There is a fomula brewing in his head somewhere that must be tapped at some point. Though, he is up there in age, it is baffling how he was able to reach into that memory banks of emotion and re-boot for this generation using their own weapons. This film is THAT good. And yes, it treads very familar territory, but what lingers is the innocence our society once had. The fact that the society depicted had imploded and relies on some phony universe to provide our happiness. The lesson is deep, in terms of what we expect out of the 'real world.' So we distract ourselves constantly. The land, in this case is the OASIS, a virtual world to escape the drudgery of life. And EVERYONE is sucked in (cough, the internet...cough). The creator embedded a contest, ala Willy Wonka style to win the control of this virtual open world sandbox. And a gazillion dollars to boot. Enter Wade...a nerd who lives in stacked trailer home. He's been orphaned (ahem...Disney) so he lives with a, well, redneck aunt. Miserable, he spends a great deal in the OASIS. There is a competing firm, headed by Sorrento who wants control over everything. Apple vs. Windows...I mean, your choice.Of course our hero runs into a female gamer named Art3mis (played by Olivia Cooke). She is that tomboyish nerd who guys like me have crushes over. In the OASIS she is a badass biker chick most likely influenced by 'Akira.' Her big anime eyes and skin-tight outfits suggest she has some self-esteem issues, similar to the rest of the world living in virtuosity. But there is something else about her that is revealed later.Anyway, for my 40+ year old fringe nerd ass, this was a return to the ol' days of Spielberg. A little sweet and carefree, without the biting cynicism of our world today. Yes, there are really dark moments, but it's a Spielberg film man. And it was just a joy to hear Alan Silverstri with that marching orchestration I loved from 'Back To The Future' or 'Predator' It's a mix tape that I listen to with a massive smile on my face.",9,0,1,31 March 2018
"I, Tonya"," Nearly Perfect
","I was 18 years old when this all went down and the thing I thought about was 'who cares, it's ice skating?' and 'I'll jerk it to Nancy Kerrigan, she's hot...and the crying makes it better.'
Yes, that is the history of 'the incident' where Tonya Harding, supposedly desperately wanted to be in the Olympics so bad, she supposedly coordinated the attack on Kerrigan.
This sort of resentment exists in anything where talent and skill are in full display. The same could be said about filmmakers. One loves to throw shade on each other. But there still exists a mutual respect. That it was even made. The resentment, no doubt, boils within the person. I'm victim to it. Others are as well, but it's never voiced as openly as 'I,Tonya.'There is no way in Hell director Craig Gillespie didn't study 'GoodFellas' when making this movie. It is the embodiment of that style to the exact whip pans and breaking the fourth wall. And he nails it! Like Tonya Harding's triple axel. Without even the story of Harding versus Kerrigan...it's still a fucking fun movie. There is so much energy and dark humor. This is the movie 'Three Billboards...' desperately wants to be. Because the darkness to the humor is earned and doesn't have contrived brutality to make you believe it. In fact, there is a moment when she addresses us directly and accuses us of...well, it's all true, which sucked the air out of the theater. That is amazing filmmaking.
The performance of Tonya by Margot Robbie is a little bit caricature of the person. Though I think she walks a fine line. It's so razor thin and she does it so effortlessly. Like a perpetually dumb teenager who listens to 'New Kids On The Block' it isn't a spoof. And that's the hard part about the movie. That she plays a notorious bad girl without playing it for laughs. She just...is. It sometimes is heartbreaking. And Sebastian Stan who plays Jeff Gillooly, whom I thought a buffoon back in the early 90's was a brutal guy. Never did we once believe he would end up killing Harding, but you get the feeling it was only a matter of time. The wild relationship they had almost excused it for love.The trophy definitely goes to Allison Janney as her mother LaVona Golden. An unrepentant white trash Mom-ster who is either a stage mother or a wicked step-mother. Her physical attacks on Harding seem so effortless it's the shocking part of the movie. Like after so many attacks, it became normal. She should win the Oscar for Supporting Actress (though probably not because it's an awful mean person).How do you make a film about someone everyone knows more about than you? This is the answer. Take the key players names out of the film, and you still have a fascinating film about the ruthlessness of the ice skating world (not much different than the beauty pageant). People also forget that Tonya Harding was the first American woman to landed a triple axel. Yes, folks, the only American woman who had the balls to do it. If she's chippy about her legacy, she deserves to be.",9,1,3,29 December 2017
Suicide Squad," I Don't Get The Hate
","Story? There is no story. And that's what's refreshing about this movie. It's pure entertainment, in the sense of 'Voltron,' 'A-Team' or 'G.I. Joe' which is putting together a unit of absolute bad-a$$es to do something. Does it matter what it is? No.I'm so sick and tired of political messages jammed into Marvel movies (I think comic book movies on DC & Marvel are dumb to begin with). They happen to be the most offensive of the two. I suppose THIS constitutes what the world enjoys now...supposedly. Or the PC police critics.I can't begin to tell you how nice it is NOT to have social agendas in a movie and just...have fun. The hate may stem from the people who love these characters in the book. I can't justify any of it, since I don't read the funny pages, but it seemed to anger a lot of fans of the characters. Personally, Leto's Joker is...too comical for the grit of this movie. He's not as bad as you want him to be or as fun as Nicholson made him out to be. The Ledger Joker was...let's be real, the guy was fishing for recognition. But...it is what it is...entertainment.",8,9,20,8 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," This Will Not Stand Test Of Time
","Oh so many people glowing about this mess. This whole they infiltrated so-and-so and now we don't know who's who is stupid. Plain stupid. If not for a few clever moments, this would be a wash. It's like no one's ever seen a movie before.What starts off really promising becomes quickly a bland introduction to Marvel's newest coolest 'hey didn't I see them in a comic book moment.' Get over yourselves Marvel. The captain is a dumb study in one dimensional stupidity. No wonder you introduce someone as awful but pretty as Scarlett Johansson. She's really terrible. She cannot act. The lines drop dead out of her mouth, like lifeless eels. She's BORING. Even though she believes she's interesting. Or Marvel wants her to be.AND to make matters worst, here is more and more characters being released after the coda. We knew it was coming. It's dull now. People will like what people like, and I suppose in the whole scheme of super-hero movies, this isn't terrible. Funny how no one ever mentions the fact that Steve Rogers is the poster boy for steroids, which is awkward considering they walk through a museum of kids wanting to be just like him. Whatever. I'm not political, but that is irresponsible. But let's not let that get in the way of making tons of $. It's a good time waster. 'waster' being the operative word. A lot of kids will l like it, and I have to hand it to them for trying to inject depth where none existed. But this is a one-trick pony. But they're obviously hell-bent on more in the series. Good luck with that.",5,1,2,27 December 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Are These Reviews Real?
","It's like the morons who gave this movie a good review have never seen a quirky small town movie before. The scope of your cinema experience explains the gushing that is involved in this absolute mess of a movie. Is it a comedy, dark comedy, drama. This Martin McDonagh guy doesn't know. It's everything. First off Frances McDormand is at her weakest ever. Her performance, isn't a performance because she was born to play this. Anyone remember 'Olive Kitteridge'? No? Then you are the idiots who need to watch more movies, because this one is in the basement compared to others in its ilk.Let's recap this movie for the people who 'loved it' -Mildred Hayes rents three billboards to antagonize chief of police to continue to investigate the murder of her daughter, whose last words to her was 'I hope you get raped too.' Is this funny? Music didn't tell you that. -Mildred retains a relationship with her ex-husband who is STILL physically abusive. In a bizarre scene...she is lifted off her feet by the throat while the son breaks up the fight by putting a knife under the throat of his father. Then within seconds, they reset and act as if nothing happened. This was seriously in the movie. -Her ex-husband is dating what looks to be a supermodel. When he is some small town hick. Really? Only in a movie can you force this. -Sam Rockwell's character Deputy Dixon lives with his mother and is a dumb brutish bigoted sidekick to Woody Harrelson's chief Willoughby. They both stumble on violations or things that seem like violations. Trust me, this explanation is funnier than the execution. -In a small town where a teenage girl was raped and burned alive, Willoughby and wife leave their children to fish as they go off to have sex (seriously).Anyway, you get the point. Any one who liked this movie have serious mental issues or are retarded. This movie is dumb beyond words. But fortunately there is a dwarf in it, Peter Dinklage who is the best thing in this god-awful mess of a movie.",2,29,54,8 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," It Ends How It Should
","It's become fashionable to hate on anything JJ Abrams or that Kathleen Kennedy and her cadre of Disney shills don't get Lucas's vision. To the 'Star Wars' fanboys out there, you've lost your memory.
Those films from the 77'-'84 were CORNY. Yes, watch them again. Super cornball. But all you remember is waiting in line, or hearing it word of mouth, most likely listening to Madonna whilst doing so. So these memories are etched deeply into your nostalgic psyche.
Enter, the millenium. Technology has grown and social media blew up. Now we could communicate with each other through the air. Comment, criticize and destroy. This is the power wielded by some sad obese basement dwellers who have dedicated a portion of their lives to seek and destroy, anything that touches their precious memories. If you can be honest with yourselves and see this in the mirror, DON'T go to these movies. They aren't exactly for you. Nor do they cater to the new generation. Because these new ones are JUST as corny as the OG ones.
Face it, JJ Abrams is the ONLY guy who could've maintained composure while facing these nutjob fanboys. You don't deserve Abrams to make you any Star Wars movie. You wouldn't have been happy if it were anyone doing it but yourselves. And guess what? YOU'D screw it up too. Because what is being attempted can't be done. That is to turn back the hands of time to a more innocent time in our lives. Where things like Facebook, Instagram and IMDB didn't exist. Where while we explain these movies to people we suddenly conclude that it was a pretty decent movie. 'Return Of The Jedi' is getting some past due respect. Though it is CLEARLY the weakest of the OG (directed by Richard Marquand). Fans of this have NO CLUE what they want.
So here we are, at the edge of the new decade. And 7-9 isn't perfect (I'm not nuts to think they're masterpieces) but neither were 4-6. Time will tell. And I think when people revisit these, when their children are older, will discover the 'whys' of this and the previous two under Disney banner.
I simply don't agree with the bad reviews. The film pandered to who it could to please you, and I saw that effort and I appreciated it. For those who are destroyed by the banality of this series, I pity you. This is joyous escapist cinema that doesn't exist anymore because you bring too much baggage. Leave it at home and enjoy it with your children and allow them to (possibly) see the value that is in the canon. Let it breathe for a damn minute before spewing hate.",8,4,13,20 December 2019
The Devil Wears Prada," A Guy's Perspective
","Here we are, nine years out from this movie. I revisited it wondering...why? This movie is about starting out in life. And that it's not going to be an easy ride. Magnify this with just a terrible boss. Now, if you work in anything entertainment base, you've heard the stories. And it extends even to the menial of heads of departments. Even a key grip can be a total jerk. And they play these mind games constantly. Most likely to conceal a deeper anger of being...not the top of the pile. Whilst everyone envies those who are in power, they are oftentimes faced with decisions that are just...morally bankrupt. Is it forgivable? Possibly. Is it understandable when you're in the midst of it? Nope. And Andy (Anne Hathaway) figures this out fast.While not an amazing movie, it really hits on the fact that even the devil could have human qualities. Could it be a way to allure their victims, or be a learning experience. Testing you to see what type of person you are. Palming an bright shiny sweet apple to see how close you get. What I liked about this movie is that it rides that line. Never is Miranda (played wonderfully by Meryl Streep...duh) ever unjustified in her behavior. She is high-stressed and can't be bothered by details. As a new person, you see this as ridiculous pretentious garbage, but...the question is, why criticize something you desperately want? Andy is a Ivy League school go-getter. Probably would annoy you in school. But she is ambitious. And the reality is, girls like her, are seduced by a Miranda. They are jet setters and feared. The power is intoxicating. So in order for her to fully commit, she has to take the leap. With the guiding hand of Stanley Tucci's character. He is, I consider, the most tragic of Miranda's minions. He went through the ranks, in anticipation of the rewards. But the truth is, the world isn't fair. He doles out this advice to Andy in hopes she toughen up. Which eventually becomes putting it to practice.There is a lot of truth in this movie that the novel may seem more one sided. The movie is far more even to how the world works. Had it been the straight novelization, we wouldn't get Miranda's motivation to her behavior. It's not terrible (as most would feel), it's how that world works. And if you don't like it, you don't have to belong.",7,0,0,4 August 2015
Nightcrawler," Interesting But Not Enough
","Every once in a while, a movie will come along that people will glow over...and if you don't, they consider you an idiot. I feel this is that movie. It's a snob's movie.It's an interesting idea, but the main character is so despicable and so removed from being an empathetic character, you really just want to strangle him rather than understand.It's a simple idea, that goes against the norm. Why? Not because the story is that interesting, it's because the script requires it to. Let me give you an example... If I were to tell you that in every movie a man will start up his car, drive down the street and pull into work, my solution to making it mundane is to make the guy an assassin. The anticipation of his drive becomes different. Does it make it a little more interesting? Yes. Does it make it a good movie. No.What I do like were the supporting characters. It's frustratingly easy to play them mental case, as Jake G. does. It's a slow burn, but a constant one. He isn't right for this role. He's got a dull look. And losing weight to look gaunt doesn't improve the interior storm. He becomes a bargain basement Tobey Maguire when they needed someone that could balance the dark and funny. Gyllenhall is just too bland.To the movie though, there are just too many open ended moments. What really irritates me abut this, is that ratings are so high that a pedestrian movie watcher is going to feel really driven to watch it. Most should be warned, it's not typical 'entertainment.' Most will be confused as to what they just watched. It's unfair for intellectuals to not realize that a guy from a factory coming home for a weekend is going to take your suggestions and think it's really great. It's not. It's so interior with its ideas most people outside of L.A. may be disappointed. It's the culture that doesn't exist outside of oddball self-involved jerks.",5,9,20,3 November 2014
Baby Driver," A Spinning Record
","A very steady directing hand by Edgar Wright. Music is the sync of life and he plays it to the hilt about a driver for crimes because...he's indebted to a crime boss. Simple enough. Until you introduce nutjobs.Quirky fun and clearly a filmmaker who knows how to put together a movie that isn't trying to be so computer graphics heavy. What a relief it is to watch a movie where you see the director's personality in it rather than stupid superheroes being thrown through drywall. God, I hate Marvel. Anyway, the ending looks like they ran out of money. But the movie is fun enough, and I hope it does well, because we need more movie makers who know how to make movies.",7,2,7,3 August 2017
Justice League," Crowd Movie, Leave Politics At Door
","There were two d-bags who were talking during the showing I went to. Guess what? It didn't bother me because they were geeking out about who they saw. And they laughed at the right moments and high fived each other. For those watching it alone, yes..it's not going to be a good experience. The audience LOVED it. And it became infectious. It's not a terrible movie as most have rated it. It's trying so hard for you to like them. So in that effort, it is a fine movie. Why did I rate this an 8/10? Because it is pure entertainment. Marvel is hellbent on spreading socialism and BLM agenda. Oh, I meant...authoritarian agenda. Disney is behind this. They are garbage people (child molesters and sexual assaulters) who have shielded these monsters for decades. Though they inject moral outrage into their films. Get bent. There is no message in Warner Bros./DC universe. And yet it suffers from (big surprise) poor critical reviews. Lap it up children.It seems this franchise chooses to treat movie goers as adults and not as spoon fed Leftist toddlers. Yeah, Ben Affleck was accused, but there isn't a morality tale in 'Justice League' that would parallel the world they want under socialist regime. This is true Super Friends movie without idiotic Leftist rhetoric. But I suppose the critics/press lambast it because it doesn't mold to that message. For shame. Yes, it's not a perfect movie, but it is a fun one.",8,1,5,19 November 2017
Bridge of Spies," We're Going To Miss Spielberg
","We're going to really miss Spielberg when he retires. IF he retires. This is craft to the highest form. And the attention to every detail is sorely lacking in movies. Craft is IMPOSSIBLE to relate to movie makers today, because it's when talent meets instinct. And we lack instinct.The story is of Tom Hanks who plays defense attorney James Donovan, that deals with insurance policies. As we're introduced in the beginning, he does what every defense attorney does, he spins the truth to meet his client's point. It's a little scheisty, but he's clearly effective. This gathers the attention of his boss, who assigns him the duty to defend an alleged Soviet spy. I don't even believe in due process, unless I'm bustedof course, but he is entitled to a 'fair' trial. If that is even possible. The United States is under high alert in light of the Cold War (Muslims anyone?) and Germany is rebuildingsort of. With the freeze out of the Russians who've gone deep into secrecy. Were we ever friends? So, now we got a captured Ruskiewhat happens? Well, don't want to give away too much. But he is exactly how we imagine someone captured should act who comes from the Eastern Block. Cold, detached and resigned to their fate.So, now as advertised, we get a spy exchange. But who does it? The C.I.A. washes their hands of the issue. The State Department don't want to be involved? Well, they wrangle Donovan into the mission. Except, it's not a mission. Because if caught or killed Donovan is on his own. Because of the freeze out (literally) of Berlin, and the historical split to East and West, they aren't playing games.The movie isn't the most exciting. Espionage, in the truest sense, would most likely be a lot of waiting. But this moves at a really nice clip and because of craftyou watch every beautiful frame with anticipation of the next visual (beautifully shot on film by Janusz Kaminski).This is a movie that only professionals put together. The minute you watch, you know the people who made it are skilled. There is an easiness, practically effortless (looks like) storytelling. They let the moments between the family develop. The intricacies of our diplomacy made simple despite the thick fog of friends and enemies. A classy sophisticated movie. It's high art.",9,4,10,18 October 2015
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Thank Donald Glover
","Ever since Glover begged to be a 'Black Spider-Man', people were intrigued by the idea. Except purist nerds. So, here's your version where you can have two Peter Parkers in their 30's (?) and have the Black one too. Because they open up a universe that allows anyone to be Spider-man, if you can be bit by a radioactive spider, you can be a web spinning one. Okay, that's not the point to this movie though. It's basically to forgo the logic of...common sense. As in, how many radioactive spiders exists in New York City (the one this Spider-Boy exists in) Answer: Too many to deal with.
Look, it's a massive leap into a franchise that is overdone and boring. In fact, they joke about it. But the flash and dash and clever animation is brilliant and deserves the accolades, it still seems a little forced. Consider the logic again. Trying to tie some alternate universe into a changing storyline is things J.J. Abrams got a ton of flack for, somehow...fans forget his 'Star Trek' went over this territory already.
Okay, nuts and bolts aside, it's fun. And funny. And good enough where you don't have to think too hard about these things. Kingpin, the villain, isn't just comically villainy. There is a point to his madness. And there are enough fun moments with Doc Oc or Liv that make it enjoyable.
Great way to launch a new style of animation others will start to rip off.",7,1,4,26 December 2018
Dreamgirls," Effective
","A highly effective facade of one of the most fascinating girl groups to come out of Motor City. This movie has great musical numbers. A love triangle. Some fantastic performances that span decades. Rollicking music. It moves fast and hard, and those who suffer attention deficit, you won't even realize you've moved on to the next era, less you blink. This movie is tops. A fine production that takes a stage play and makes it cinematic (which are often disastrous).I did have a single issue though, some of the music...sounds very much like a orchestrated or 'fake' version of what is presumably the song they are mimicking. Some of the tunes will be VERY familiar. Specifically a segment where this bizarro version of the Jackson 5 do a number for t.v. It's somewhat unsettling. Like when they make up fake NFL teams for a football movie. Just feels a little off.Otherwise, a solid musical movie.",7,0,0,18 December 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," It Doesn't Get Old
","Let's be clearTom Cruise is a bad to the bone. And the only reason we don't recognize this fact, is because we've fallen for the dumb stuff about his Scientology beliefs. But make no mistake, that's him hanging on the side of a cargo plane. Are you serious?! The physics of the move itself is immortalized. Also keep in mind, through the decades, we've had John Wayne, Charles Bronson, Lee Marvin, Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. If you went pound for pound what he's been able to do physically at their age versus Cruise at the same ageI'm not sure how to word this: He takes the crown. And it's not just this one stunt. He gives you this for free. The rest of the movie has him in peril throughout. Because they do this awesome thing, where they switch the terms. He is no longer the hunter, but the hunted. And they saddle him with people we like. But are they good or bad? Are they will the IMF or against them. As fictional as it may seem, these special task force of spies are believable.They are fun, they are precise, and just having Rebecca Ferguson (who plays Ilsa) added to the mix makes for the next installments interesting. They make no mention of Michelle Monaghan who married Ethan Hunt in previous installments. Will she make a return? Who knows? We do know Ilsa could be an older sister to her, looks wise. Ilsa is a great character. She is beautiful and lethal. The big talk about Michelle Yeoh going head to head in 'Tomorrow Never Dies' is pale in comparison to when Ilsa does go hand to hand against a male henchman. She physically looks like she can do it.What makes this also such a great time isCruise is often dumbfounded by how he's able to survive when odd things happen. It could be a nod to even the cheekiest of Roger Moore's Bond. Straighten your tie after throwing someone off a roof-type stuff. But that's the joy of it. It actually doesn't get tiring. For example a scene where (and I'm not ruining it since it's in the trailer) he just came back from the deadand he and Benji have to go on a high speed chase. It's absolutely ridiculous to have Cruise drive in his condition. They address it. But they use it for great laughs. Reactions to justbizarre moments. Even Renner and Rhames gets in on the fun. Particularly watching Pegg and Cruise flip a BMW end over end in what can end in permanent injury, they banter about the incident like a great Preston Sturges gab fest. This movie is what espionage movies were about. Brisk and expertly made. It moves from location to location and doesn't seem forced. This is by far the best action movie this summer. Why? Because even though the technological gibberish is goofy, THEY make it work. Through self-referential humor. Or just addressing the nonsense of spy school, this is the fun we may not see in the new James Bond. So lap it up while you can.",9,3,7,1 August 2015
Dunkirk," An Experience
","This isn't a movie. It's an experience. So I treated it as such and walked away...disoriented, since you really feel like you are there. Watch it in IMAX 70mm 15/70 rather than 5 perf 70mm.For an American like me, I'm not entirely sure what the big deal was. But to Brits it meant a lot. When the stranded soldiers are desperately wanting to get off the island, the German soldiers were closing in. Problem...you never fully sense the horror of the war like the beginning of 'Saving Private Ryan' Instead, you get a relatively quiet movie based on a rescue mission. The battle was an absolute failure but the victory was in its retreat. Interesting concept.With most of Nolan's movies...what can you expect except total immersion. For that...what an accomplishment. For others who hate on Nolan for being...Nolan, you probably will hate on this too.",7,3,8,3 August 2017
Captain America: Civil War," No One Dies, Who cares
","Marvel wants its cake and eat it too. So they not only NOT kill off extra needless characters they actually introduce new ones. For one purpose, the rope in another demographic. C'mon...Black Panther? He has the same skill as Black Widow, except he's really black. And a prince/king and a martyr for angry militant African country. Hey, knuckleheads, it originated in Oakland, California. Oh right, semantics. Wow are audiences dumb. Oh it's not THAT Black Panther movement, but they act militant like THAT Black Panther movement. Puke.Also the relationship between Bucky and Captain America...really? Most of us wouldn't help our friends move. This yontz protects him AFTER he finds out parents (not telling who) are murdered. Is there a grey area? Not really. Cap. Am. is supposedly a man of high moral character who values the justice system over friendship. Right.This movie is proof society is lowering its standards of common sense. Not that I hate this film. It's fun whenever Rudd as Ant-Man gets involved. And the new Spiderman gives me hope. Marisa Tomei as Aunt May...gimme a break. There are no stakes in this movie. It's the worst part of Marvel stuff. It's for kids. If you approach as such, enjoy!Well, gotta try EVERYTHING.",4,26,54,5 June 2016
Non-Stop," Keeps You Guessing
","This surprised me. A thriller on a plane that has you thinking you know all the answers (because we're such expert movie watches), then flips it. Yes, it's a contrived subplot. And the reasoning behind this terrorist act is goofy, BUT...it is a lot of fun. It interweaves a really elaborate set-up that you have to focus on to understand.Also, for people who think they're sophisticated in camera motion. Think about that space. The camera moves in (perceived) 360 degrees without a) seeing camera shadow b) camera angle is near impossible with the movements they had. This is visually sophistication that most won't see or care. But it adds a ton to the claustrophobia.Julianne Moore is great, as always. Neeson is perfect for this role, but one has to wonder how this behemoth of a guy fits in a airplane bathroom.",7,175,214,3 March 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Complaining about being unique...?
","....look no further than a Wes Anderson movie. Yes, it's silly and theatrical, but boy do his films really stand out. He is unique. There is none that he seems to draw influence from or after. So, in that sense, his films seem to rise above the norm (obviously). But, atop all this, it is a fantastic story telling technique with a lot of heart. To me, it's always been like 'Rushmore.' A group of kids putting together a theater production that seemed to be put together by kids. It's a more mature toy box. A great joy to watch his bizarre characters do what they must. Thrown into an eventual spiral of zany-ness.I really loved this movie.",9,0,3,11 April 2015
The Favourite," The Funniest Most Brutal Film of The Millenium
","Those who are familiar with the somewhat self indulgent monosyllabic writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos may watch this and feel a bit of commercial appeal style that we were all wondering when he was going to get it. He does, and we've been made the fools by previous efforts.This is acerbic, hilarious and brutally immature look at regal life during a time when feudal wars were at hand. While it still lacks the typical Hollywood-ised completion, this is the film I've been waiting for for a VERY long time.
The story is of Queen Anne who is at the head of England suffering from...responsibility. A Millenial in her time, perhaps? She is played pitch perfect by Olivia Colman, whom if Academy voters aren't too weighed down by all the political 'movements' should see this as the most perfect performance of the year. When the story begins, Queen Anne is watched over meticulously and with a great deal of tough love by Lady Sarah, played perfectly by Rachel Weisz. Along comes her cousin Abigail, who recently traveled to the estate to seek out employment. Little by little she integrates herself into the good graces of the Queen and slyly usurps positioning.
While this seems like a game of up-womanship, it is really about the fate of England. Admittedly, I know very little about royalty, this film requires you don't know much. Only that women can be brutally cruel to one another to edge one another out. And, boy...is it brutal. The verbal sparring and bitter passive aggressive behavior is catty and mean but also wickedly fun. Pay close attention to the small statements that get under your skin. Even the men get into the act, sooner or later. It's when we learn later that these positions do require favors to remain, in favor (hence, 'The Favourite' what we are watching is Joan Crawford vs. Bette Davis in royal garb.
And guess what? Emma Stone holds her own in English vernacular against the English Weisz INCREDIBLY well. Though it slips at points, it's the rhythm of the speak that makes you forget she is an American from Arizona.
The beautiful cinematography by Robbie Ryan is brave. Oh boy is it ever brave. Extreme wide angles cover ever corner of that manor which oddly makes it feel like some cold dripping prison. Poor workers who wait in the shadows are felt like the presence of statues, yet do very little to quell Anne's horrific behavior.
For those who see this film as their first Yorgos Lathimos project...I mean, 'The Killing of A Sacred Deer' is tedious work. This, however, written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara holds him to a brilliant standard. Along with his usual surrealist imagery and dark comedic timing, it proves to be a match made in Hell (in this case).
I love love LOVE this film. One last thing...I hope Nicholas Hoult gets a nod by the Academy as well. He is brilliant as Harley, who spins his own web every time he is on screen. While dueling with Sarah, he turns favor (reluctantly) with Abigail to attempt to gather some foothold in how the kingdom will survive. In the most devious way. Just awesome all around. Something else to consider, once this film was done, I wanted to stay past credits so I could watch again. It's that much fun.",10,21,46,8 December 2018
It Follows," Dumb movie
","This movie starts pretty strong but doesn't end up giving you what you want. It's very clear this director studied late 70's terror movies. A lingering shot is neat, but can be pretentious, especially if you're not Polanski. Also, it just looks cheap. Plastic cheap digital cheap. This was $2 million to make? I call B.S.I realize this guy was attempting to change the genre a little. Maybe adjust it for modern times, but it seemed like it was just a pale copy of better paranoia run-from-the-monster type of mood piece. Watch any Japanese ghost story to get the better effect. The other thing that cheapens this movie is that there is no explanation as to this phenomenon. Really? Just...it happens...I guess if it follows, it happens. I was truly disappointed at the glowing reviews of this movie. I've lost faith in society if they can't tell this silly piece of garbage which veils itself as art for style sake to something who is studied in the craft of storytelling. This thing was a rambling mess.",3,20,42,24 August 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The Most Gentle Of Tarantino
","In his only film with zero N-bombs, Tarantino takes on the town that he grew up against. And though there really isn't much of a plot to speak of, it is an exercise in atmosphere and recreating a bygone era without internet, cell phones, or social media. Instead, creative people bounced around waiting to do things. Especially in the case of Rick Dalton, a washed up Hollywood Western actor who has been relegated to playing villain roles which is the road to being a true washed up actor. Without an actor, listless Cliff Booth...Dalton's stunt double is also without a job.
Now, you may be really frustrated at where this film goes, because...really, it spins its wheels until a gruesome, yet darkly funny ending emerges. And, truth be told, it's really not that funny either, it becomes Tarantino's next attempt at re-writing history. Does it matter? No...the title tells you it's a fairy tale, but what I got from it, is the sensibility of drifters walking through Hollywood trying to do things without it being anything other than employment. Today's Hollywood is more about being famous than anything.
And that is the charm of this, is that DiCaprio's Dalton isn't wallowing in fame or fortune, it's that he is desperately looking for the next role.
Yes, once you get Tarantino's little gags, such as anticipation for something brutal to occur at the Spahn Ranch where Manson Family live...it becomes a tense humorous release. OR, the constant jokes on absurdist dialogue. Yes, those are transparent Tarantino. BUT, in an odd way, this is ALSO his most casual bounce. A bygone era of...innocence. As if a child told you this story.
And if you can dig that, than you will have a great time.",8,15,23,27 July 2019
I Am Legend," How Sad
","There is no joy in crazy town.
How appropriate it is now that we have a virus in 2020 that is running the same path as what this one in this movie is. Tragic, sad and melancholy. I believe Will Smith was channeling Arnold Schwarzenegger in 'End of Days' because the ultimate sacrifice doesn't necessarily pay off.In the case of Will Smith, something about him bugs me. He can never be...uncool. Even when he's doing a sing-a-long with 'Shrek' he's still...that cool dude. Then when he attempts to show vulnerable, he is still trying to be cool. In that attempt at retribution scene with a car. By the way, it was his stupidity that got his dog killed. And also that got all those people killed. But he sort of owns up to it. It seems Will Smith's name got it made.There was so much more fun to be had in 'Omega Man.' He understood the fun of being the last guy on Earth. He didn't fearfully tread through life but accepted it. Charlton Heston understood this. And he was cool. Will Smith is also a doctor in this. Sure. If he's a doctor, I'm an astronaut.So so many questions. Like he created a fortress of metal, bolted railed sliding doors. Uh-huh. Where? From Home Depot? His house...have you seen a bigger house in NYC from a doctor's salary? What did he do? Sell Russian secrets. That basement alone. A grenade takes out every one of the monsters in a basement. It's a grenade.This is just a boring sad flick. Good for quarantined life, if you want to create more panicked nonsense (this site censors thoughts) in your mind.
Monsters look cheap. CGI cheap.
This was a colossal mess.",3,1,2,30 April 2020
A Quiet Place," Thrilling In It's Melancholy
","You think during the first reel, this family would self-dstruct and most would consider suicide. The answer to the last reel makes you wonder...well, at least it wasn't 'The Mist.' The darkest ending in modern cinema.
It starts off as setting up a world where noise sends monsters out from the dark. They are quick and snatches you so fast, they leave behind not even a scream. How did they get here and what do they want? Does it matter? It is a great taut study on how to do so much with so little. So as it stands, the family just wants to survive the monsters who have annihilated the world. So what are we left with. Base survival that has no internet, or angry trolling critical reviews.Director John Krasinski has crafted something so effortless in its sadness of existence that you wish there was another sequence that shows the rebuild. What essentially begins as the set pieces of 'The Walking Dead' turns expertly to innovation of survival.
Though I dont agree with the ending... it still gives us such great moments and pulls us along with so many great 'oh no!' segments, it's impossible not to cheer the final shot.
An old fashioned scary film without the unnecessary urban myth.",8,1,4,7 April 2018
Coyote Ugly," 20 Years Later Revisiting This
","After 20 years, I'd have to say...it doesn't hold up that well. BUT, that's not to say, it brings a tug of nostalgia for that era of Jerry Bruckheimer slick music video retreads of 'Flashdance'
A lot of it is due to Diane Warren's corny soundtrack music. And those of us who were in college by now, have a slight shiver when we hear her anthems. Which nearly toppled another Jerry Bruckheimer gem 'Con Air' with 'How Do I Live Without You' Oof.The present day woman would consider that dis-empowering to be so attached to a man (or perhaps this could be used towards other women). Speaking of which, the topic at hand is 'Coyote Ugly.' Presumably, an article led to this story (written by Gina Wendkos). I recall a friend had moved to New York City and discovered a bar called Hogs and Heifers, which shared very similar rambunctious behavior (nailing bras to the wall). And dancing on bars and so forth. In Jerry Bruckheimer world...it's PG-13. So none of the topless stuff is displayed (unless you get the unrated DVD/Blu-Ray which shows Piper Perabo's funbags).Though this movie is about making it in the big city, it is somewhat laughable at the truncated timeline. Within a few weeks Violet Sanford (Perabo) becomes the hottest songwriter in the country with a number 1 hit that is sung by Leanne Rhimes. And though these girls are suppose to be world and tough, the painfully model casting of...Tyra Banks, Bridget Moynahan, Izabella Miko and Maria Bello set this in a truly fantastical mystical world I'd reserve for...um...say Hollywood. If that was the intention than kudos to director David McNally. To me, it seems less genuine. Jennifer Beals would seem like a dog up agains these girls.
Any way, great to see John Goodman pop up as Violet's New Jersey dad (though still seems like he can't shake that Dan Conner-ness) and Bud Cort's very small cameo.
Clearly this movie was made to rake in the jiggle factor. So, cheers to them for recognizing what it exists for. Also special note to cinematographer Amir Mokri. Great lighting. I feel this may get a re-release in the future. That will stand up well.",6,0,0,16 April 2020
Call Me by Your Name," Oh Man Is This Gay
","Is it really a good time to award this movie anything, considering the Kevin Spacey allegations? Do you really want the firestorm to return to entertainment, Golden Globes.
If you can set aside the homosexual nature of this movie, it is a really effective story of crushes and first love. Though plodding and a bit of a slog, the mood is what you go for. Such as the late afternoon dinners. Swimming in the lake. Listening to rain. This has that coming-of-age sense that 'Man In The Moon' (the one with Reese Witherspoon). It's heartbreaking in terms of how life does move on even after devastating emotions (well, at that age anyway). And the beauty of simple life in Europe in the 1980's as a teen must've been this charming. Again, this is going to be trashed by Middle America, with good reason. But it is a great film about capturing a time and feel of being overwhelmed with love.",7,1,15,15 December 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Not A Comic Book Guy
","I went into this movie not a comic book person. I think it may've been helpful in just letting the story be absorbed. There's something about Marc Webb's storytelling that really hits the adolescent side of me. All the good parts of it. The first love. The lost love. He just is very tuned into the pain of that loss and the ability to move forward. That's how I felt about AMS2. This was an gentle rendition of this series that added a lot more character development in a storyline that is all too familiar. I really enjoyed that Garfield's Peter Parker is an authentic teen. He is trapped in a vortex of whether or not his desire in life can outweigh his responsibility. Something that echoes, without being overbearing, in the voice of his dead uncle. You get that he is a very haunted person.I feel, for the most part, this isn't really a comic book movie. It's got comic book characters. But it seems to be more a great drama. Very well done and a nice puzzle piece to the new rebooted series. Can't wait to see what's next.",9,11,29,19 May 2014

","Whether animated or not, this is a great story. And I'm not even a filthy Mexican.
This may be a response to Orange Headed Commander in Chief, because there is no way Mexico is like this. It's a gross place with bodies hanging in overpass. That aside, this is really about family. And remembering who you are and who you come from. Miguel is a headstrong pre-teen desperate to be a musician. Unfortunately, his ancestors have banned music from their...life since great great grandmother was abandoned by one. That's when Miguel takes matters in his own hand. While attempting to steal a guitar he feels is rightfully his (nice message to the thieving cholos watching).
This takes him into the mystical magical world of the afterlife. Since it is the Day Of The Dead, Miguel is a living boy in a dead man's party. This is where he learns a lot about family and friendship and love.
This movie is deep in sentiment and family love, which is a FANTASTIC message given the idiot Millenials are so dead inside, they have no clue what that means if it isn't on their smartphones. Their children will reap the benefits of this great story. I loved this movie, and if life were fair, it would win the Best Picture of 2017. Instead, it'll probably go to a movie that is homosexual in nature or other lame Hollywood causes they're quick to hypocritically abandon. Because God forbid we have a touching heartfelt story about family's sticking together. Yay for Coco!",9,0,3,22 December 2017
1917," A Nice Video Game
","I've been griping for years for a WW1 movie that would show the real ugliness of that war, and here we are with 'Saving Private Ryan' story. Get the message to the front before something bad happens. It so happens, the brother of one of the travelers is at the front lines about to face certain death.
While that is an engaging premise, the execution is...well, let's just say there is a reason why there is editing in movies. It's a slog because the travel time is essentially at real time.
Though I will give credit where credit is due, how do you make that remotely interesting. Well, predictably, it's to include townspeople. In the French, a couple of faceless enemy soldiers and running into other soldiers. It couldn't just be a walk. Great. Unfortunately, you start to feel the slowness of the flick. The concept is great, but we missed out on the true ugliness of war, BECAUSE, it most likely is THAT boring. So you see the exercise in it.
Granted...director Sam Mendes does something really great, which is not glorify war. You see a LOT of aftermath.
However, too many dumb things in this movie that anchor it down. The dead run through mortar and gunfire at the end is pure..um...'Dances With Wolves' or the fact that the Germans couldn't shoot straight to save their lives. Too many questions bog this down. Was there a better solution here? Probably not. This is THE best a WW1 movie could be. I guess. 'Paths of Glory' is probably better.
All in all, it's not a movie recommended on a streaming platform. It is a theater movie, so go see it there.
The rest, well...I can't say it has a re-watchable quality. I went with a friend who said he would, but I doubt it. Sure a few people here probably wished they hadn't wasted their time in the first place.",6,31,74,13 January 2020
Big Hero 6," Delightful Entry
","Into Disney animation. A wonderful story of growing up and learning some things about adolescence. Is it enough fun enough for kids? The 4-10 year olds in the theater that I saw it sure thought so. Irritated me to no end, but I consider that a mark of fine storytelling. Does it have enough sentiment for adults. It sure does. It follows the typical Disney story outline. Which if you don't know, I don't want to mention it here. But you'll see everything there. It's not a bad model, it's a fun one. A nice distraction to a more sullen movie release times.I dig the joy this movie has. The love of comics/superheroes and...the one thing I can say...which is also present in 'Interstellar' is the embrace of science. It seems to be a rebirth of the appreciation of something we seemed to have abandoned. I dig this movie. Kudos!",8,12,32,8 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I ABSOLUTELY understand the Hate
","Let me be frank, I ran for A New Hope and Empire once I was done watching this over-inflated film. BUT, I can't help but feel it was attempting to tread on new territory and build on what was already established. Unfortunately, it carries the burden of a 7 movies before it, so a LOT of comparisons will be drawn to it. This is very much like Empire. She goes to train with a reluctant Jedi master as her friends are fighting to stay ahead of impending doom. We even get Lando's doppleganger in Benicio Del Toro. If you ever wanted to get a sense of Lando and Han's relationship...this seems to be an echo of what may have transpired.
I don't blame Star Wars fans for blasting this. The jokes are pretty much parody of itself. The characters do dumb stuff. And lead characters are separated. My guess...to introduce more people into the new universe. Why am I giving it a favorable review?
It's so well made. Much like the Spielberg/Lucas teaming, you can tell Rian Johnson makes...films. Rogue One seemed to be movie by committee. Though I don't think Johnson has the pixie dust buoyant touch of JJ Abrams, I can tell he is adding much more academia to future episodes. So this is more about the hope of better things coming up rather than what I've seen. Take that for what it's worth. As a film, there are heartbreaking moments that I won't get into. But it tugs at your memories in a good way. You sense Han Solo's presence, but...it seems so long ago. And how they handle Luke and Leia made me misty for the ol' days. Forget the underlying political junk of this era if you can. To me when we age out, it's always a sense of moving forward.",7,0,4,16 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Grossly overrated
","I'm really confused at the glowing reviews of this movie. Dull characters. Dull story. Just dumb. I practically fell asleep. Considering I'm a huge fan of James Gunn since his Troma writing days (and to show I'm a fan, anyone else notice Lloyd Kaufmann's cameo?). This one almost put me to sleep. And for those who've claimed it was laugh out loud funny and the audience was behind it 100%...a few chuckles here and there, but the audience I saw it with, walked away confused.There is going to come to light that the majority of the reviewers were paid sponsors of this movie. Something fishy about it all.Anyways, Chris Pratt is good in the role. He is pretty good at playing the 80's character turned into the future, and still retains a 80's face. Rocket (voiced by Brad Cooper) is funny when he needs to be, but is a one-trick-one-line pony. Groot and Zoe Saldana's character are cardboard. Boring stupid forced Shakespearean relationship between sisters. And blah blah blah. Dull is the word. I'm honestly shocked so many people glowed about it. Something is clearly not right.",4,29,68,12 August 2014
"McFarland, USA"," It's About America
","I loved this movie. It's simple and straight forward and you sense what is going to happen, but who cares. It's the journey these young kids go through. It is about what America was about. The hopes and wishes of their children doing better than them. And most of the time, it is something that isn't gigantic. The stakes are huge, but they are life changing.Costner plays it really low key. He puts on the charm of previous films that have him hapless, yet hopeful. The whole point of this is that America gives you second chances. You can take opportunity and whine and cry, but you can also see the good in it. Think about terrible jobs you have in life. The simple solution is to do it half-ass and complain. Well, of course, you first fall under that spell, but the smart person sees potential and makes the best of a bad situation. In Costner's case, the choice was forced upon him. A defeated family man who wants to make the best for his wife and kids. He openly shows disappointment, which...truth be told, most men tend to suffer silently. His supportive wife (played by a subdued Maria Bello) skirts the very touchy subject of being a talented but saddled with near poverty. This was how it was in the 80's. She believes in him. Yes, corny for our post-2000 world, but it felt..real. Contrast to that, these young Mexican kids who have no other future but to be migrant pickers. You are told this is generational. And there is no getting beyond it. This is their reality. But for a brief moment, they found a small victory in life. That glimpse...everyone should experience at one point in their lives.It is an inspiring movie, and oftentimes on the nose. Given in the hands of typical Disney grinder, this could've been eye-roller. But in Niki Caro's hands, it was effective. I like the movie, I liked the kids. And I liked the performances.",8,7,26,21 February 2015
The Shape of Water," The Shape Of Fish Guy's Schvantz
","Really Del Toro? This constitute a love story?
This movie is designed for shut-in crazy cat ladies who dream of banging inanimate objects...for life. Then the Pinocchio comes to life.
Though beautiful in its art design, why does everything in this world look like a terrible sound stage? It's not magical, mystical or captivating. It's gross and awkward and mean. People brought their children to this movie. And saw 1) middle aged chesticles 2) Michael Shannon humping his wife brutally. It was so awkward and not the least bit 'romantic.' Can anyone explain how a top secret facility with a Fishman can still allow a woman to have lunch and play Glenn Miller records in the company of?! What nonsense is this? Oh right, it's a fable. Or something. Wait, how does Michael Shannon tell biblical stories in a fable. Wow is that meta.
This movie is just awkward. You stumble out of the theater just flabbergasted at what passes as romance these days. This mute chick will do it with anything.",2,97,198,16 December 2017
American Made," I've Seen This Before
","Something is so very familiar about this movie. It seems director Doug Liman is doing his best Oliver Stone impression. Fueled with a little big of mania, Tom Cruise plays Barry Seal, the former TWA pilot turned drug and gun smuggler turned family man. I put that last because, let's be honest, we saw so little of the family in context with his life.And let's address that right now. For someone who had a wife and three kids...there is a logistical flaw in his puttering around with famous drug kingpins. Speaking of which, Barry was the Forrest Gump of the drug world. Stumbling amongst the famous characters in life that we remember from this era. He's a simpleton from the south too. Well, kinda. He gets in WAY over his head and spirals into working for everyone as a complete innocent. But he's not. The most aggravating thing about this movie IS that he doesn't seem to have a moral compass. He's muling in so much cocaine and getting so much money for it, it's hard not to hate the guy for ruining lives. But we don't see that part. We see a great scam. Or at least that's what it seems like. Crazy characters who bounce through the buoyant cocaine 80's. The end doesn't justify the means. AND, to make matters worse, a key character who is close to the family meets a tragic end, and is forgotten by the last reel. That is ridiculously lazy. Maybe honest, but confusing. I applaud the cojones for Cruise to step out of a little comfort zone, but there is something less endearing when he really gets despicable. Also, why does this movie feel familiar??? That nagging thought may eat at other viewers. Speaking of which, was this thing shot on VHS. It's looks video-terrible.",6,0,3,4 October 2017
Love Actually," Great Holiday Flick
","Boy did I come to this party late. A great holiday surprise. Full of crass humor, mistaken intentions, international jibes and...well love.Love, this movie will have you believe, is everywhere if you look. If you're a cynical person this film really will not work for you. Especially in the opening scene where it's EXACTLY stated that love is everywhere, if you look.It's a statement alright. And now it has to prove that love does and will come in many forms. I love the interconnectivity of these seemingly disconnected people. This type of movie is what Garry Marshall wishes he could do with those stupid holiday movies. This one clearly defines the relationship. This guy loves this girl but can't follow through because of this reason. That's it. Simple. Drama. Comedy. It's all here. They want you to love this movie so much that they have a tough ex-rocker (played by Bill Nighy) promise to strip naked and play his hit song, if it goes to number one. The issue being, HE doesn't believe in his Christmas song. Delightful! There's also a heart-wrenching moment, when this old codger realizes the real meaning of love, through a mist of groupies, drugs and alcohol. What prevails is the heart. A wonderful moment for all those with troubled pasts.Well, you've more than likely have seen this movie by now. But I felt it necessary to share my thoughts (as is the tradition of holiday reviews around the holiday times...for me anyway). Dig this movie.",8,1,3,22 December 2014
Joker," A Slow Descent Into....Okay
","No one will ever say Joachin Phoenix didn't give his all, but if you watch enough loner-with-an-agenda film such as 'King Of Comedy' or 'Taxi Driver' you know where the pieces will fit.
The other thing is that the message of how society, in its neglect for the mentally ill will cause a rift in a population that is sick and tired of being sick and tired. In this case, where you identify with is where the Joker can get you. And empathize for what he must do. An achievement in making the unintentional sociopath that we see in all the movies. It's not without its charm. Granted, these dark misanthrope characters never bothered me...call me a dark person...there are sly nods at what is to be (a young Bruce Wayne sliding down a playset pole to greet Fleck was an especially nice one).
The other thing is what is known as anachronistic music and movies. Okay...having Cream and Gary Glitter and having Charlie Chaplin is no longer an alternate universe. It means Gotham is real and it kept having to readjust my mind that it wasn't New York City circa 1981. They either know our pop culture evolution or you don't.
The other thing...is that it still raises so many questions as to the Joker's history. A simple one of emotional betrayal by those he held close but can't exhibit closeness isn't going to work. The betrayal is meaningless. Which, unfortunately, is the ugliness of The Joker.
Who do you root for here. Thomas Wayne, the future tyrant capitalist, unwavering in a modicum of kindness who is a victim of rampant unrest between the rich and poor. Or the Joker, a product of the most sludge scraping bottom who does very little to further his lot in life other than to report to a menial job while being medicated to death? It's all ugly and there are no sunshine. That is NYC today...I mean Gotham. It's a perverse film that sets up larger ideas that seem to fizzle into an unnecessary overbearing notes of 'gee, isnt the music so different than what we see' territory. Todd Phillips does an excellent job at capturing the time but look...it's either reality or it's not.",6,7,14,19 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Proved My Suspicion
","Admit to yourselves, those who championed the first re-boot of this that you haven't seen it since. That being said, this is absolute proof your gauge was painfully off the first time. These kids have personalities built into a box and not one person that I cared about more than the 90's 'IT' And it wasn't because of Tim Curry. He's great and will never be outdone (sorry kid who played him in this one, you aren't charming enough to be creepy as Curry was). The 90's was pure adult cinema. This is...some video game retro trash.
This movie (if you can call it that) drops us RIGHT at the end of the first chapter. Where they supposedly defeated the being that kills children yet goes into hibernation when the Losers Club thwart Pennywise's spree. 27 years later, their 40's version get called back into action. Here we learn they are all successful, yet do not remember their childhood past in Derry. All the better, since the traumatic events of the first one sent their memory into hiding as well. When called together by Mike Hanlon, they vow to end the terror once and for all.
I truncated the synopsis because...well, the more I think about this one, the more I really hate the people involved.
First, they steal the back and forth between past and present from the 90's version. Yet, somehow, that version was much more effective. This one has that gimmick where they run past their former self. Basically a memory that crisscrosses and such. This novelty wears down fast. And we get bits and pieces of their life as adults.
The 90's version really nailed the sense of their older selves. Again, they did the perfect casting by putting in...known television actors. This was a stroke of genius because the director most likely knew we bring our own baggage with them. Annette O'Toole, Tim Reid, John Ritter, Dennis Christopher, Harry Anderson, Richard Thomas, and Richard Masur. Absolutely brilliant because off the bat you really cared for them (with their history as good people in sitcoms and night dramas and cult films). Similar with their child counterparts.
In 2017 and 2019 'It' I really have no idea who any of these people are. James McAvoy is PAINFULLY mis-casted as Bill Denborough. As is Jessica Chastain as the grown up Beverly Marsh (though curiously, the teenage Bev in the original was bad casting). I never got the sense any of these adults lived a complete life. The abusive father tied to the abusive husband idea is tiresome. In the 90's version it hits you a little harder, since O'Toole played her more as a woman who was abused versus Chastain's baffling take as a woman who is affectionate to her abusive husband.
Any way, it gets REALLY tiresome when Pennywise becomes the spider and the resolution seems tacked on and...well, let's be clear, even Stephen King had no idea what 'IT' was. So we get this overly computer generated VERY unscary thing.
There's too much to pick apart. It's just an awful money grab flick that totally lost that charm of fear. This became a dumb actioner, a woke it's okay to be gay thing, and well, it's a modern take. And when the dust settles I was surprised at a nearly 3 hour run time, it still felt like nothing happened.
I feel, these days, when they hand out assignments to make a movie, the statement is 'don't screw it up' Life experience truly creates this, and somehow I feel the writer and director both need to live more life to know what makes nostalgia important. It isn't just rattling off pop culture references.",1,1,1,8 March 2020
Murder on the Orient Express," Classical Filmmaking
","The scope is massive without it being a stupid brain-deadening superhero movie (God, someone shoot Marvel and DC dead...video games come to life are not FILMS!!). This is real filmmakers making a real film, and by all critics who've bashed this film on this site have overlooked, it is as patient of a film you will see. And if we're to wish pure storytelling to exist in the future, this is a reason to hold it tightly to your chest. Instead of beating the drum to comic book heroes. In this case it is a simple detective tale with characters stuck together in order to solve crime. Director Kenneth Brannagh seems to have an affinity towards both the source material and the Sidney Lumet 1974 version (the train full of stars). So what if you knew the answer to the who-dun-it. You know how most Thor movies end (here's the hint, with your brain melted and fat from stupidity). This film is photographed as old Hollywood. Something desperately missing are, less cuts and more staging. This is the film that showcases it with a great deal of zeal. It's exciting to see camera angles from the heavens that peep in on a intimate conversation. THIS is filmmaking. Or that we see multiple characters introduced throughout the train as background characters. Or that there is a coziness to this like playing the board game 'Clue.' And to top it all off...there is a deeper idea with the detective's story that wasn't in the 1974 version. Can I defend this to the simpleminded film goers today who lambasted this film for everything making films is all about. Oh right, most of you have or will never make a film in your lives. That's why you watch movies and not films. See this movie and re-calibrate your compass to how they're suppose to be made.",8,8,21,13 November 2017
Parasite," I'm Going To Ruin This Movie For You
","I had to delete my previous review after considering it for a day...
So folks...here it is...
It's 'Married With Children' meets 'The Three Stooges' told with great style and eventually dark violence.
Yes, friends..you've been fooled and somewhat charmed, but it seems the people who've rated this a masterpiece just got a dose of cold reality.
They even mention Chicago, Illinois in the flick. Which is where the 90's show took place. Critics are too dumb with short memories to draw this conclusion, which is why I'll fill you in.
Dad who is underemployed/unemployed, former gloried athlete
Wife has no aspirations to work, has bad housekeeping skills, crass
Son, distances himself from the low-life world of his low life
Sister, street wise and pretty. Uses her sexuality to get thingsI wondered why it felt familiar. In fact, there is an episode where they meet a rich family at a campsite. Also, 'The Simpsons' had an episode where Homer loses the house to carnys.
So much for originality.
Though you're fooled by a different message of the have and have nots. Which confused me even more. They spent so very little time allowing the family to integrate themselves as 'the rich' which is how it was sold.
Any way, the message also backfired, considering how despicable the 'poor family' behaves. The only rationale is that they are so desperate, their actions are forgivable. No, the ends doesn't justify the means. It becomes even MORE muddled when we see the future life that is the possibility, never mind the supposed Morse code feature works only one direction. So if the son is writing a letter to the father, he can't get it. Or maybe we're to assume he left it somewhere where he'd find it. Too many damn questions.SPOILERS!!! Stop reading if you are going to see:I dunno, it's shot well, and it's funny, but there are just questions. As one reviewer had put it 'why do they make dumb decisions?' Are they trying to say that poor people are dumb? Also, when the old housekeeper comes back, why don't they just join forces? The entire thing was unnecessary and aggravating. Also, what was the end game? To kill the rich people and assume their lives? And the fact that poor Dad snaps and attacks the rich Dad over a stench poor people have? Delaying the bleed out death of his daughter?
Pretty grim stuff.
All I know is neither of these guys scored 4 touchdowns as a fullback for Polk High",4,17,35,3 January 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Rip Off Of Day For Night
","This is a really well-executed rip off of a movie very few people have watched. Or had and forgotten. Surprised no one has brought this up before, but it has identical themes with identical characters and identical moments. The one thing we can say, is that it is an indictment on the life of Michael Douglas (Keaton) the same way it was about the indictment of Francois Truffaut.I think it's a great steal though. And done well. It really put Keaton into the driver seat of both being an apologist for his career and executioner of the fan base that followed him through his Gotham days. IF his life interests you and his opinion of nerds who fell into the hole of Warner Bros. product, this movie will fascinate you. For the rest who care very little about a has-been superstar self-imploded spoiled actor, this will irritate you.I liked it for the insight to how people like Keaton feel about us. And critics. Does it effect him...what the public says...yes. Does it guide his life...no. He's perfectly content on the lackluster career he's had since the cape crusader. Has he spent a lifetime proving to you that he isn't that guy anymore? I think so. I never thought he was that guy anyway. But...I find it odd that someone who turns to be beloved such as Jack Nicholson hurdled this stardom but someone who is in his head so much, like Keaton got buried under it. This movie may give you a glimpse on his own psyche.It's not enjoyable, but has moments. And moments are enough.",6,0,6,20 January 2015
The Big Short," God Are We Dumb
","I'm sure a lot of this is going to be dense for people not read up on subprime mortgage loans. But they simplify it by allowing cameos to instruct you like a hygiene film back when I was a kid. It's comical in that it's told to hold your interest on the insanely ridiculous way the government sold the American dream and then...allowed the banks to dick us. If you believed in those types of things. Because the victims are watching the movie, slowly fuming, while the real people out there who fleeced us...well, they keep living.This movie should be required watching to anyone who trusts people in suits too much. Hard work and earning a plot of land is a perfect way for these wolf in sheep's clothing to sell you. Worse, when they are your neighbor. Now the interesting thing about this movie, is that we are watching the hunter watching the wolves watching the sheep. Yep, it's that dense. And I am sickened at the very thought that there...well, I won't give it away only that it's eye opening, sobering system of capitalism, that you can believe or not. I think it happens. I've seen some of my friends who've bought into the system, only to have a ghost town pop up where there was once hope. It's a haunted house story at one point. The remnants of dreams are far scarier than any murder. Because, the system runs deeper than we realize. How do you plug a dam after the hole has exploded? Why grab some buckets in start baling? Nope. Continue the path that we've set out. All to get richer. You know what that is? Morally bankrupt people. The movie does a great job in fleshing out the groups of people who did cash out on the insanity. But, they aren't proud of themselves. They are just as brutalized when some conclude the resolution didn't adjust the moral fiber of the American Dream. We sold ourselves way too short, in essence, when we wanted something for nothing. I blame our easy to gain mind numbing pop culture that has sold us wants, instead of remind us of needs.I LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie. And is a must to see when the holidays die down. It is very sobering to the holidays, and is a shame it will probably lose out to...well, ironically the movies that keep us in the fog. I don't mind the fog. I prefer the fog. The fog is where life is happier.Please go see this movie.",10,4,9,24 December 2015
Mother!," Dumb People Won't Understand, In Other Words...Populace Today
","There are small moments in this movie that deserves repeat viewing. It's aggravating but different. It follows no template of Hollywood films, but you think it should. And it gives proper credit to a heart-wrenching sound design.This will go down in history as a movie overlooked in retarded 2017 (I say this because theater watchers are texting, talking morons...I've yet to go to a theater recently that a idiot didn't do any of the above mentioned). This is far more important of a film, yes, stupid idiots who didn't 'get it' this is a film NOT a movie because Jennifer Lawrence is in it. Rex Reed, movie critic HATED it. Claiming it to be misogynistic and pretentious. It's not a MOVIE Rex, it's an experience. Yet no one can absorb movies anymore, because they can only casually watch. This film is everything. For me, it was the decline of society who idolizes celebrity and selg-righteous indignation. For you, most likely something else. 'mother!' is it all. Much like the title character, they give and give and give everything and...it still amounts to jerks who watch this film and want something more. That's the point. There is nothing left to give. And you're ungrateful.",8,4,14,25 September 2017
Jojo Rabbit," Whoa
","If you can get past the painful anachronistic quality of the language or the fine line between dark humor and tasteless this may be for you. There may have been a reason Jerry Lewis decided not to release 'The Day The Clown Cried' Simply put...the Holocaust and those who chose to fight on their behalf between lines probably deserves a respectful tone. Instead...the very modern attitude makes it seem like a farce. It's extremely dishonest and when serious things DO happen, you cannot undo them. Towards the end, we get a taste of what that is.
I will give director Waititi credit...this is a swing for the fences, and for the most part works, but I think it'll leave many people wondering why. That said...the other grating thing is knowing the audience knows how reality turns out. Hitler loses. In a bizarro world, it doesn't feel like he does here. In fact, regardless of the child (literally) kicking Hitler to the curb, you sense indoctrination is taken too lightly.
Still...some touching moments with mom Scarlett Johansson though her German accent is horrific...and the efforts to make her this angelic savior of Jewd feels phony. Given Hollywood's penchant for concealing their own monsters.
I'd say middling is very fair.",5,2,8,20 January 2020
Deadpool," This movie is not good...but they want you to like them
","This is the pixie sticks of movies. It hits you in the dome and then you wondered why you geek'd out so hard. I couldn't recite one joke from this mess. It's not that memorable, because he's so clever and so funny and so charming with the references. Right? RIGHT?! This, of course, will pass for today's theater experience. Throw it on the wall and hope they like something. Watching this was equivalent of someone grabbing you by the scruff of your neck and dragging you through a teenagers bedroom circa 1990-1996. Like when you went over to your friend's house, and their little brother couldn't stop annoying you with their toys. THE single biggest issue I had with this movie is that there are way too many people cracking wise. Deadpool, his bartender friend, his girlfriend, the blind Black woman he inexplicably takes as a roommatefor what reason, please tell me (so he can crack more jokes?). This is one big skit and violence in between. There are so many questions to his psyche that despite Ryan Reynold's supposed charm and self-effacing humorit doesn't cut to the darkness. Yes, there are glimpses of true pain and anguish, but it's quickly diffused with THAT humor. Either you get it or you don't. And it's hard to imagine any of the teenagers in the theater I saw it in understand why the 20 something hot prostitute girlfriend knows the value of a Voltron ring. She's really not that cool. She's a whore, but doesn't look like one, act like one, feel like one. I see that years earlier, this would've been a great role for someone like Gina Gershon. In this movie, this girl doesn't have that broken busted look NO MATTER how much pain in life she's endured. Number one rule of storytelling, show DON'T tell. And there's a TON of tell.Backstory upon history, upon explanation. Yes, it breaks rules. But it also doesn't know when to use the rules they set up. They break the fourth wall to talk to the audience. Then make references to how cheap this movie was made (only TWO X-Men characters). Is this funny? Yes and no. Most people don't give a damn about what's outside those walls. Only that you're entertaining us. But that is the point. They are DYING for you to like them. I don't think I've seen a movie try so hard for you to like them. And for the most part, I do. Butit's exhausting to be around this attention deficit flick. For the most part, are the stakes really that high? Not really. Wade Wilson a.k.a. Deadpool voluntarily accepts treatment for cancer that will kill him. He's cured. Except now he's deformed. His biggest issue of revenge is ridiculously superficial. Which they had to explain away, in terms of how people find each otherlooks being the sole purpose. Even though nothing in the history would explain Wilson and his girlfriend's attraction was due to looks. They are kindred spirits by way ofpop culture. So similar, they might as well be brother and sister. That's broken rule number two: there is nothing unique about her. She is the proverbial hooker with a heart of gold. Or is she? Who knows? She doesn't seem to be in that much of a hurry to leave the business (as she's seen later as a cocktail waitress at a strip club). By the way, has anyone asked what she's doing at a bar which is frequented by regulars and would just nonchalantly let in a hooker trying to score johns? The villain issoplain. What is his super power? Oh, one that he gave himself. And it overlaps with others. And is vague. He doesn't feel pain? Okay, so that sword that is jammed through his shoulder and carotid wouldn't, you know, stop his heart? I guess not. Since, in this world, you'd need to feel pain to bleed out. And he heals slower than others, so say a hubcap to the face, or being thrown through vehicles wouldn't, likebreak every bone in his body? Nope, not in this universe. Also, the teenager with the cool name and the ability to (apparently) nuke the worldhow is it that it didn't incinerate Gina Carano's clothes off. Obvious as the big metal Russian guy was sparring with her, she had nip slip. If you're going to go all the way, start with that. Look, don't ask too many questions and you'll have fun. For me, it did what it needed to do. But I don't think this movie will hold up to the hype it's getting a few months from now. It's a lackluster ice cream with a TON of whip cream. It'll make you fat, and you'll regret it down the road however, it's a good matinée watch, and worth debating with Marvel nerds.",5,31,74,14 February 2016
Green Book," Best Movie Of The Year
","This movie gives no apologies for being schmaltzy. And I love it for that. It's classical storytelling ala 'Driving Miss Daisy' in reverse. And color change.
Mahershala Ali is brilliant as piano prodigy Don Shirley, who needs someone to drive him on a tour through the deep South. Enter jamoke Tony Lipp. A newly unemployed bouncer whose brawn is worst than his bite played by Viggo Mortensen. Let's be honest, NOTHING is unexpected her if you've watched brotherly love movies from the past 30 years, or road movies for that matter like say...'Rain Man' the resolution is exactly what you think. But...so what? It's beautiful and touching and gets you in the right spot. And I love director Peter Farrelly for it. The problem with today's movies is that it believes being mean and criticizing ALL bigots means they have to be bumbling morons. Whilst true, there are also bigots with families who have good hearts or similar ignorance. That is the dynamics of depth. Obviously, the stakes aren't necessarily Civil Rights. It touches on it, but never pushes you into eye roll territory. Though presently criticized as softening the racism with humor, what is telling is that they paint Shirley's character as the world intelligent educated gifted Black man with talent and Viggo as coming to terms with others who are MUCH more bigoted as he. This illustrates the divide of class as much as race.
The tone is of joy and friendship and understanding. And though I think it's too simple to say it's begging for peace in a tumultuous era in America (it really isn't) it still is a fun road movie. More laughs than anything. Well crafted story of grown men finding ways to grow up.",9,10,18,8 December 2018
Annihilation," It's awful
","For those praising this movie, you are REALLY doing people a disservice by not warning them how dull and dumb the execution was. Frankly speaking it's for the colossally dumb to believe there is anything deeper in this muddy mess of a movie. And it practically dares the viewer to draw comparisons to better made versions of it.
Dull is being kind. There is no mystery and there is no payoff and you better heed what I'm telling you here, you will walk away wanting to put an icepick through your brain, because it also is a droning cesspool to the ears.",1,10,21,26 February 2018
Incredibles 2," You Can Do Better!
","Director Brad Bird has admitted that we may be super-hero'd out which was his explanation as to why it took 14 years to launch this to screen. I agree with him. This movie takes every trope and...well, it does the best it can.Funny how not a single reviewer has mentioned the opening starts the same as 'Batman v. Superman' We are thrusted back into where the last one ended. But this time from a different perspective. And much like the Warner Bros. tentpole film, the destruction of the city has created a ban of superhero once again.It seems many people had forgotten the first film. Where superhero become...domesticated. They do so as both a ban and as a remedy for decades of fighting the bad guys. The Parr Family...is now homeless and desperate for any work. Bob HATES the thought of going back to insurance work. He understands the monotony but also...because he got a taste for heroism again. A topic that isn't tackled or mined as you would hope. Instead, a mysterious corporation led by a brother and sister duo (think 'Rampage' here) want to bring back superheroes. Yawn.Yes, we're back to where we started. BUT, to give the new movement a prettier face, they elect Elastigirl to be the new face of heroism. Now 60, Holly Hunter ('Batman v. Superman') has lost some pep in her step as a mother of a teenage daughter, son and baby. At one point blaming the curse of superpowers but nearly seconds later, embracing the idea that it's a better option than Bob going back to the drudgery of regular employment at something he hates.The rest of the movie seems...flat. Fun at points, a few laughs, but it seemed like a thinner, slightly less joy of the first one. Even Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) is given so little moments of being Mr. Incredible's friend, it just seemed we're going over very tired ground.Is it fun? Yes. For the most part. But it feels like a diversion or worse, something done because Brad Bird had nothing better to do. I sincerely hope they make a third one. Because I feel like a teacher who thinks they have so much potential and not enough execution. You can do better!",7,3,7,17 June 2018
Joy," Weird Reviewers
","I've read through some of the reviews of this movie, and I just don't understand the hate for it. Maybe having grown up with very strong willed women, this is an inspiring movie of everyday struggle. Is it world saving? No. Is it effect humanity? No. But there is something to be said about a woman who has put her life on hold through bad decisions to add a second act to it that inspires real chutzpah. Too bad the ones who watch it and didn't care for it, most likely had dreams die on the vine and are okay with it. Yes, you armchair critics who spend more clever quips attempting to be witty online then try to be something. That's what Joy Mangano did. Those who dilute her accomplishments are precisely the same that underestimated her in life. She seems to have no patience for those people. Instead, it seems she is more interested in go-getters that remind her that America does value dreams. If that meant survival against a behemoth of capitalism in...say, home shopping, so be it. It's not glamorous, but it's hers. And that's where I value the story. Too bad the negative reviews miss this aspect. Which seems to be indicative of how far America has fallen. It seems those who dislike its fabled quality, have the truest sickest cynicism towards the America I grew up with. Too bad. Jennifer Lawrence is sweet, funny and endearing, and when the world bends for her...as Joy, it truly meant something.",8,6,17,28 December 2015
The Nice Guys," This is a terrible movie...
","As a massive Shane Black fan, this movie is crushing. And I defended 'The Last Boy Scout.' Warner Bros. seems to be getting his dreck as Marvel uses him as a gun for hire to fool Warner to believe he can direct. He can't. This movie is an absolute mess. I am certain Black can't possibly be proud of this movie. It's awful.Sure, thank you kindly for the repeat shots of porn star tits. Or, the debaucherous scumbag references of Los Angeles, but aside from all that, it just is too silly to even be interesting.The year is 1977, and we are deep into a plot about a thug-for-hire Russell Crowe and a sad-sack gumshoe (Ryan Gosling) with a daughter. There's some tragic story there about the mother's absence, but it is strangely played for laughs. As is Russell Crowe's backstory. There is none. He seems to be a good guy who wants to do good, but sees the world as awful. Presumably a recovering drunk, he hires Gosling's P.I. to track down a girl gone missing. Sound familiar? Yep, 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' follows the template. Except here, it's really ugly and not very fun. The story takes odd turns, leads come up deadand the wise-cracking timing is off somehow. There are good moments, but that's all there is. There are the moments of endearment. Dad jokes type endearing, where you feel it's been told to Black by a drunken molest-y uncle or something. It's silly stuff you see in every movie he writes. Everything just seemed so misplaced. The action didn't even seem all that thrilling. And the fight sequences are clunky. Save for punch sounds, you wouldn't know if anyone even got hit. And the teen daughter in the world of porn in the 70's is really odd. Odd that it probably seemed more natural in a movie like 'Boogie Nights' but for Gosling's kid, she was suppose to seem precocious, ended up being a lot more unnerving. The movie is also shot digitally. Film negative would've added so much more to the mood of the movie. And you can tell how much they were fighting with the modernized look of digital with the analog look of film. The setting just looked..plastic and flat. There wasn't that aged feel, even though they had 'aged' film in the movie itself. If you're going for a plot, there is none. ¾ through the movie you're actually really confused as to what they are suppose to be doing. Never fear, someone comes into push the story forward. It happens too many times that you wonder if luck doesn't play a role in their work. They're not good detectives or muscle, they're just passive bystanders waiting for someone to tell them their next move. TERRIBLE mistake. I get that the studios probably thought 'we can't pass on the guy who wrote 'Lethal Weapon.'' That is close to 30 years old. Wow, what a difference Black is going through. He's lost so much more when he started directing. Weird, since it seems most people figure out how to directed by writing. This movie stinks bad. Sorryit just does.",4,25,54,21 May 2016
Alien: Covenant," Insulting Piece of Idiocy
","How in God's name did Scott make a worse movie than 'Alien 3'? And then Rotten Tomatoes reviewers gives it a Fresh rating to boot. Any skepticism I've had for that rating site being an accurate barometer has imploded.This movie is a masterful mess. The worse thing Scott has ever done. I won't step too much into the plot, as others have already given the best parts of comical nonsense away. Only to say this, the movie begins with a captain of the ship, who...is a free rock climber...who takes a selfie video with one hand on the rock...nearly falling. This is the man they initially send to guide a ship with 'terraformers' to set up a society. Then the second in charge...he answers a random beacon and decides it is a better course of action to follow up on that rather than stay the course. Dumb beyond belief.I am through with Scott. I've been a fan for decades, but the slide is real. Like painfully real. He is treading not only over similar material, he is gutting it and leaving the fans to rot in the sun. This is the worse of the series and everyone involved should be ashamed. A true crime of a movie.",1,639,960,22 May 2017
Draft Day," Skating For The NFL
","There hasn't been a movie that used the NFL brand since 'Heaven Can Wait.' That's all you need to know about the Nazi behavior of the NFL protecting the so-called 'Shield.' You guys play a kids game with people with less intelligence than a child. I find it pretty insulting you try to class it up with rules.Incidentally, white owners with white coaches illicit the ideals of slavery. Million dollar payouts of not, this is the true ugliness of the sport. Honesty.Anyway, politics aside, I knew going in this was going to be milquetoast movie about the sport. Costner plays this GM who hires an UNBELIEVABLE coach in Denis Leary towards the draft day. Supposedly a moment that changes young men's lives. There is no dirt to uncover here. The gleaming white QB with prospects higher than God, is on the shopping block. And there's a mad push for Cleveland to ditch the ineffective veteran (again a miscast of Tom Welling) for brand spanking new toy. They allude that he's already spent 8 years with the Browns and had it not been for the injury the previous season, he may've taken them further. THAN, as a matter of painting him to be a man of high moral character, they speak about him like he has a strong moral backbone. We never see it. But people talk about him in this weird mythical being who FAILED 7 of those years. This should raise the temp of any Browns fan. And also remind them of their futile effort of idiocy.I think you do have to be a football fan to understand the coming and going of these types of moves. They inject it with a ridiculous Jennifer Garner character and this oddball relationship between Costner and Burstyn to get some type of female audience to sympathize. They completely wasted Frank Langella as the owner of the Browns who is a one dimensional clod. Who clearly knows zip about football. Who is this suppose to be (in the real NFL)? I would find him more insidious bug if it he played it like owner Mike Brown. The owner of the Bengals, who is a true oily dirtbag. Making moves to undercut the coach, but never in public. And never verbalize his idiotic decisions but lives under the shadow of football royalty.The story is stupid. And most likely not to the fault of writers/director. It seemed like their hands were tied by not portraying the business side accurately. I kept thinking...this was an excuse movie. A chance for the NFL to say 'Well we got a few rotten apples, and a few good apples' Never mind the rotten apples' character flaws were something as dumb as not reading a playbook. Try spousal abuse, and brain injury next time.",3,1,3,23 March 2015
The Martian," What Happened Ridley
","So we're suppose to believe the whole world cheered onto a guy who was stuck on a planet, spending countless of money and effort and science geeks from JPL to support? Meanwhile, broadcasting this to every country in the world as they watched on from big monitors in their perspective cities and cheer during the rescue? Give me a break. It's that silly. Annoying thing about this is also the moment when the super smart scientist gets an idea but doesn't reveal it because...it's too cool to get right to the director of NASA to tell him off. Because time is of the essence, we have to wait to get to his office to present it. Really? This movie is dumb. Smart, in terms of the science, but really dumb in jamming a story where one didn't exist. It reminded me of those movies that are so intricate, the science geeks go gaga over, and the idiots who don't know science don't want to seem like morons and agree what a great movie it is. It's not. It's a less interesting 'Castaway.' Also, what's the deal with shooting it in Jordan. You know what it looked like? Utah. So, the entire time, I just considered Damon trapped in some godforsaken place on Earth.This movie is boring. Further, the ridiculous crew of the Hermes. Selected perfectly to be...so different. They're ineffective and drags. Also the pretty scientists at NASA, PLEASE! If that doesn't take you out of reality, nothing will.Corny and stupid but well made. So I know why others think it's a good movie. But it's the worst. Now director Ridley Scott, who did so well prior to 2003, has lost his touch. I would dodge this garbage.",4,4,9,23 December 2015
Atonement," Atonement?
","It had a amazing fantastic set-up...but then...fell flat. What I liked: ~The replay of scenes from a different perspective. If you weren't paying attention, you'd be in the dark. ~Great looking film ~solid performancesWhat I didn't: ~obvious misdirection - I can't help feel this lie would've been investigated and cleared in less than four years. Furthermore, the explanation as to why is silly. ~bleak. Why not a happy ending? Or better...why not go even bleaker. Having read others' reviews on the book, it seems the book's ending would've given Briony a more harsher 'sentence.'I genuinely wanted to love this movie. In fact, I wish I would've seen it in theaters. I think the experience would've been different. I think I would've been more immersed in the tragedy of the story. As it were, I found myself easily distracted when the lie snowballed into Briony's sad desperate attempt at atonement.",5,0,0,8 August 2013
