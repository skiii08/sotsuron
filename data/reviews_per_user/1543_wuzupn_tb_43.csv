The Legend of Bagger Vance," One of the greatest golf movies, but flawed
","The movie sidesteps boredom and brushes past greatness, and just cant seem to find a place of its own.  At times you are lost in the movie, at others you are looking at your watch. B-, 7/10",7,2,6,27 October 2002
Requiem for a Dream," One of the top ten of 2000, realisticly chilling
","Requiem for a Dream is one of the most realisticly chilling movies of recent years.  Everyone should see this movie.  Jared Leto's character is a likeable junkie that wins your heart only to squeeze it for all it's worth. You can't help but feel sorry for his mother, who is a junkie of her own. You watch her descent into madness, and will never look at your fridge the same again.  Jennifer Connely's character makes it so you will never look at strippers the same again.  Marlyn Wayons is funny and delightful.  This movie will sweep you off your feat. A, **** out of ****, 9/10",9,0,1,2 November 2002
The Ring," New Classic Horror Movie (B+)
","How could you even doubt that this movie is a classic?  Even if it's not that good, it's still classic.  Buy this movie and show it to your kids, they'll show it to their kids, and it will continue to scare for generations.  Maybe it's a little cheesy and unrealstic, but that's the point.  It's some of the most fun I've had all year. B+, 8/10",8,0,0,2 February 2003
Minority Report," One of the 10 Best Films of 2002
","Spielberg hits with a classic for the second year in a row.  Following A.I., he creates a classic Hollywood thriller.  Though it probably will  miss out at the year-end awards, it will not be forgotten. A, maybe A-, 8 or 9/10",9,0,0,11 January 2003
Training Day," A GREAT movie, the best cop movie of 2001
","Realistic as hell. The acting and writing in this movie is incredible.  It sucks you in, and doesn't let you down.  It's kind of unrealistic that it takes place in ONE day, though, which prevents me from giving this movie an A. A-, 8/10",8,0,11,23 November 2002
Meet the Parents," One of the top 10 funniest movies of 2000
","To those who havent seen it, dont miss out on this movie.  This spawned crappy TV shows like The In Laws and Meet My Folks, so you can definitly say this is a modern trendsetter.  Robert DeNiro and Ben Stlller were perfectly casted for these roles.  This movie promised laughs and garuntees enjoyment, and maybe an addition to your list of favorite movies.",8,0,0,18 October 2002
The Rookie," Great acting, great story, but
","It had great acting, a great story, but wasn't really directed great.  It was kind of boring, but at some points, very entertaining.  It wasn't bland, but it was slow moving.  Baseball fans may eat this up, though.  Worth watching. B, 7/10",7,1,1,29 December 2002
Memento," Best Thriller of 2000
",This is the best thriller and one of the top 5 best dramas of 2000.  The whole backwards idea is so interesting to watch.  The story of revenge and how damn difficult it can be is highly original and the script is extremely well written.  Chris Nolan shouldve been nominated for Best Director.  One of the best movies of 2000.,9,0,2,21 October 2002
Billy Elliot," A dramatic beauty
","The childhood of a ballet dancer is shown here with ups and downs and lots of twists.  The movie seems to real to be true. The characters in the movie are flawed yet good people, which means the acting is very well done.  Your mood changes with the movie's mood, which means the script and direction are very well done.  I think you should defenitly see this movie if you want to feel every emotion there is. B+, 8/10",8,0,0,27 October 2002
The Others," So far the best ghost movie of the new millennium- very good, very scary
","Ghosts in horror movie havent been that original since the 6th Sense, and The Others have restored our faith in being scared by the undead. Prepare to be scared, and keep an open mind at the end.  It makes sense, but it happens kinda suddenly.  Oh well, I couldnt imagine another ending. Did I tell you to prepare to scared? A-, 8/10",8,3,4,17 November 2002
Insomnia," The First Best Movie of 2002
","If Monsoon Wedding came out in 2001, then this is surely the best of 2002 so far.  The only thing competing with it in my eyes is Spider-Man, which I gave the same grade, but Spider-Man isn't really to be taken seriously. This is very well acted, and the first Oscar contender of the year. A-, 8/10",8,0,0,11 January 2003
Snatch," The Year Of The Heist (2001) kicks off with a gem
","2001 was no doubt the year of the heist movie.  Snatch came out in late 2000, but I'll count it anyway.  It is a great film, with great dialoauge. It's cast of characters is original and ingenious, and the Rabbi scene in the beginning is classic.  Benico Del Toro was made for his role in this, as was Brad Pitt.  If you count this movie as a 2001 release, it is the first great movie of 2001 (that I saw). 8/10, B+, *** out of ****",8,0,1,11 October 2002
Scary Movie 2," A grade lower than Scary Movie, but still funny as hell
","Scary Movie burst on the scene as one of the most wittiest gross out comedies ever, slashing the whole teen horror movie genre and raping its corpse.  I'm surprised Valentine and Dracula 2000 and Blair Witch 2 even came out after that.  Oh well.  Scary Movie got a B+ from me.  Scary Movie 2 was something they couldve done without, but they still had some real funny jokes up their sleeves to parody horror movies with.  The movie goes by real fast and has little substance, but you have fun along the way.  If this is your type of movie, that is. C+, 6/10",6,1,2,9 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Star Wars greatness inclining...(B+)
","Pros:  Great computer generated scenery, great collesium fight scene, great Yoda fight sceneCons:  Dialouge questionableThe original fantasy trilogy is back in time to compete with the Harry Potter and L.O.T.R. triologies.  This has all of Episode 1's strengths and none of it's weaknessess (Jar Jar).  This is a good movie. Episode 4- A+ Episode 5- A+ Episode 6- AEpisode 1- B- Episode 2- B+ 8/10",8,0,1,11 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Next Great Trilogy
","Not since the Godfather has a trilogy been so potent.  It kicks the ass of the Harry Potter trilogy and the new Star Wars Trilogy, which are being released at the same time.  The Lord of the Rings fails to disapoint.  But kinda goes by too fast. A/A-, 8/9 out of 10",9,0,0,13 December 2002
Cast Away," A New Classic
","The Oscars snubbed Tom Hanks of an award and Cast Away of a nomination.  One of Hollywood's finest in 2000, and one of 2000's best, up there with Almost Famous, Requiem for a Dream, Shrek, Traffic, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Memento and Wonder Boys. A, 9/10",9,0,0,9 November 2002
Apocalypse Now," Apocalyspe Now is classic, the Redux doesnt hurt it at all
","One of the best war movies of all time.  And not youre typical war movie, either.  It's so well written, it's where you hear 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' and 'the horror!  the horror!' from.  And dont get me started on the directing.  It is so damn good, it's one of the top 5 best directing jobs ever. See this movie. A+, 10/10",10,0,0,17 November 2002
Save the Last Dance," Pulls through at end, Satisfies me
","During one point in the movie, I couldnt even watch anymore, it was so corny.  During another point, I felt sorry for Julia Stile's character, because her convincing acting and the story's conflicts were believable and utterly dramatic.  Then came some dialouge that made me feel sick.  But in the end, had tears in my eyes and I felt like I learned something.  This movie just barely pulled it off, but it satisfied me. 6/10, C+, **1/2 out of ****",6,0,2,11 October 2002
Spider-Man," One of the best films of 2002!
","Hollywood movies like this haven't been around in a while.  It's a comedy/superhero movie that kicked off the whole SuperHero movie craze in the new millennium.  You WILL be entertained. A-, 8/10",8,1,1,11 January 2003
The Fast and the Furious," A good movie to the right audience, entertaining
","Of course, this macho flared dumb popcorn flick has a lot of bad points.  I can honestly say if you don't like action movies, stay the hell away. This movie is preferable toward hip hop heads who like undercover cop movies of extreme action and occasional good lines.  It's a popcorn flick. B-, 7/10",7,2,2,9 November 2002
Pearl Harbor," Entertaining at best, but too melodramatic
","Yes, the fight scene was cool.  I loved watching the attack, with its innovative camera technique of following the bombs down.  But the rest of the movie- yes I was entertained, but was not buying it.  The love triangle we've all seen before.  The melodramtic parts of the movie sucked, like Cuba Gooding Jr.'s cameo.  But it wasnt poorly written, because the part where the guy was trying to propose to a nurse was hilarious.  The movie was just lacking and tried to fit too much in. B-, 7/10",7,0,1,2 November 2002
Resident Evil," A cool movie
","It does follow a futuristic sci fi action movie formula.  The characters have been done before- on the team there's the 1. black guy who dies 2. the smart one who no one believes 3. the one who's been attacked already and has like a virus in them 4. the one who is cool with 2. but dies and 5. the one who no one likes cause the person is a bitch or an asshole.  The laser things that cut people up are cool, and the Red Queen is weird and funny cause she's a little British hologram girl.  It's a typical sci-fi movie, but one of the more fun ones. B-, 7/10",7,0,0,29 December 2002
Remember the Titans," Decent enough to earn a B
","I almost gave this movie a B-, because it is at times corny and predictable. I felt my stomach turn when the Titans danced on the football field.  But the whole feel I got from the movie was satisfying, and I recommend it. B, 7/10, **1/2 out of ****",7,0,1,21 October 2002
Blue Crush," MUCH better than I expected
","The commercial advertises young girls in bikinis in a dumb sports movie.  It was NOT.  It was realistic, and well made.  The movie should appeal to surfers and non-surfers alike.  It's very dramatic.  It's a DAMN good movie. B, 7/10",7,0,0,22 January 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," One of the top 5 of 2000, best foreign language of 2000
","This movie will blow your mind.  The love story of Zang and that guy from the desert is one for the ages.  The action scenes are some of the best of all time.  There are almost no flaws at all- I thought about giving this movie an A+ for some time. A, **** out of *****, 9/10",9,1,2,2 November 2002
No Man's Land," 2nd best foreign language film of 2001
","Second only to Amelie, not have I seen a greater foreign film in 2001. It's funny as hell.  It's situation of a man who's lying down for days and can't take a crap cause he's stuck on a mine...genuis. A, maybe A-, 9/10, maybe 8/10",9,1,3,13 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," The most fun you'll have at the movies in 2001
","This was written old school style, it's the type of comedy/romance/drama that you don't see much of anymore, especially in Hollywood.  This is definitely one of 2001's best A-, 8/10",8,1,2,2 November 2002
Men in Black II," Bad Sequel
","This movie shouldn't have been made so popcorn-y.  It just went by so fast and had the stupidest plot ever.  It had a lot of funny jokes though, but then there were some horribly corny jokes that followed it ('who let the dogs out'). Men In Black- A- 8/10 Men In Black II- C, 6/10",6,0,0,11 January 2003
Mulholland Drive," One of the best films of the new millennium
","This is one of the top 3 best films of 2001.  It's one of the most weirdest and funniest movies I've ever seen.  The acting is incredible.  I love how this is more than one story, and how it feels like a dream.  WARNING: This second half of this movie is very confusing, so I advise watching it again. A, 9/10",9,2,3,29 November 2002
Black Hawk Down," Fun first half, kinda boring second
","First off, I loved the sound in this movie.  I loved the action, too. And the self conscience 'should we even be here?' attitude.  The movie wasn't as good as I had hoped, but it didnt suck.  I'd give it a B. 7/10",7,0,0,13 December 2002
The Mummy Returns," A fun adventure, but kinda lame
","In the summer of 2000, blockbuster sequels lacked the fun of the original. Rush Hour 2, Jurassic Park III and The Mummy Returns are all fun but childish and watered down.  Still, they're all worthy all- B-, 7/10",7,0,0,2 November 2002
From Hell," A solid B thriller
","This movie is very creepy, and, near the end, very good.  The whole movie leads  up to the suspensful end.  It could've been better, though.  The girls in this have fine acting and are fun to watch.  Worth a watch. B, 7/10",7,0,2,29 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Not a just a kid movie, so much more than that
","I had low expectations before seeing this movie- I thought Harry Potter was just some kiddie phase that somehow made it from book to big screen.  Boy was I wrong.  This movie is a pretty good start to a series I'm getting sucked in to.  It's perfect for kids, a new classic story for them to enjoy and even learn from.  I liked it because of it's  imagination and originality.  Worth a watch. B+, 8/10",8,0,0,6 December 2002
Enemy at the Gates," Entertaining
","it had more punch than the usual war movie.  it was very suspensful at some parts, but dull at others.  watch this if you're a war buff, but pass if you've got a short attention span.  Jude Law is an incredible actor. B, 7/10, **1/2 out of ****",7,1,2,21 October 2002
A Beautiful Mind," The type of movie the Oscar season needs
","This is the type of movie the Oscar season needs.  It's just a great movie. I'd say Russel acted better than Denzel. He shoulda won.  The movie was incredible to me, cause I love movies that follow someone over a long period of time.  To watch the awkward guy get old is great.  And to watch him insane is great. A, 9/10",9,0,2,13 December 2002
Bring It On," The Lighter Side Of Teen Movies
","2000 was still the Golden Age of teen movies, which started in 1999.  Most of these movies were terrible, but every now and then, a gem would occur. This is one of those gems, with realistic and funny potrayal of the trials and tribulations of high school teenagers.B, **1/2 out of ****, 3/5 stars, 7/10",7,0,0,11 October 2002
Blow," A Goodmovie, but not Goodfellas
","Is it a homage to Goodfellas or a cheap knock off?  If Ray Liotta wasnt in it, then it wouldve been a cheap knock off, but Ted Demme is paying his respects to Martin Scorcese with this movie.  Johnny Depp is good, as always. B, 7/10, **1/2 out of ****",7,0,1,27 October 2002
Shrek," One of the top 5 movies of 2001, an instant classic!
","Shrek shook the world as an instant classic for young and old.  Breaching the top 5 best movie list of 2001 came this animated comedy- who knew?  The jokes were so well written and the movie has a hidden message about love that hopefully everyone caught while enjoying this new classic of the 21st century. A, **** out of ****, 9/10",9,1,2,2 November 2002
Vanilla Sky," See this, Mulholland Drive & Waking Life
","Vanilla Sky was like the Hollywood version of indies that made you think in 2001.  Waking Life was the best of the 3(A+), then Mulholland Drive(A), and then Vanilla Sky (B+).  Tom Cruise shines when his face is smashed.  The movie is definitly well written.  Jason Lee seems out of place...but meh. Cameron Diaz is perfectly obsessive.  I know girls like her.  That character is very realistic.  Penolple Cruz isn't that bad.  This movie is a delight. B+, 8/10",8,0,0,13 December 2002
Signs," Good Hollywood Alien Movie
","The scenery.  Set in an eerie cornfield.  Perfect.  Scared the hell out of me (I live in a place similar to that).  (It reminded me of Frailty).  It's a typical Hollywood thriller, but one of the best.  Hollywood usually makes good thrillers action packed blockbusters like Independence Day and Armageddon, but to see them make a quiet, eerie, slow moving blockbuster thriller suprised  me.  The director is real good.  I loved it when you could only see the sillohuete of the alien when he's standing on top of the barn.  People complain that they look kind of goofy, but when I first saw it walking by the kid's birthday party on that news channel, I was almost screaming.  And the humor was a good mix.  Mel Brook's brother (I cant spell his name) was a funny character in that and a good supporting actor.  I loved the army sign up guy.  It's a great Hollywood family movie. B+, 8/10",8,0,2,22 January 2003
Amélie," The best romance foreign language film of 2001, one of the best films of 2001
","While Amelie was one of the best foreign language films of 2001, it isnt the best of them all (did anyone see No Man's Land?).  But it's safe to say it's the best romance.  I love this movie.  It reminds me of Run, Lola, Run.A, 9/10",9,0,2,6 December 2002
Thirteen Days," Intense and hilarious, a fine WAR movie, if you can call it that
","Great acting.  Great writing.  Wit is thrown around from everyone.  It's fun to watch how realistic the people are, each holding on to their beliefs. The intensity and pressure builds and doesnt let go.  The formula to a great movie has been applied.  B+, almost an A-, *** out of ****, 8/10",8,0,0,9 November 2002
Donnie Darko," A near perfect CLASSIC
","This movie is one of 2001's top 3 FINEST.  Jake, now a star in Moonlight Mile, gets dark as hell and acts his best in this dark comedy/sci-fi whatever.  It's freaky as hell.  Funny as hell, too. This will be your new favorite  movie. A, 9/10",9,0,1,6 December 2002
