Iron Man 3," Iron Man without Iron Man (or the Mandarin)
","Clearly Robert Downey Jnr wanted to make this his last Iron Man movie so a story was contrived to allow him to drive away with honour as a happy man with a fixed heart, both in terms of his love life and his physical injury. Blockbuster movies these days are designed around demographics. IM 3 is no different. Women have to be empowered so Pepper ends up with super powers. Women don't need men so Tony Stark doesn't save Pepper from her plummet to death. An Asian audience must not be offended so the Mandarin is converted into a white Caucasian. An African American saves the Presidency (i.e. Obama). British actors overwhelm Hollywood movies so a few jokes are thrown in about British theatrical actors playing roles in superhero movies. The esteem of scientists and DNA engineering has been lowered so the bad guy is a scientist who alters DNA. Fallen American soldiers in the Middle East have to be honoured so we are given a young boy who has lost his soldier father. Returning vets from the Middle East suffering from the effects of war are represented by Stark's anxiety attacks. Engineering is too clever a subject for most audiences so Tony Stark becomes a mere mechanic. The super rich are largely detested by the public so Stark's Malibu home gets blown to pieces. Hard drugs users are used as the prototype for the villains who can either handle an overdose or explode in an inferno.The final message is that there are no superheroes. There are just men and machines. As with modern day drones, the Iron Man suit becomes an unmanned drone that can be lost in battle without harm to its operative.Very little of the comic book super hero is left. But the makers knew this would appeal to a wider audience of non-superhero fans so they experimented with that path. The comic book fans will wonder if the real Iron Man is still out there somewhere. I'm sure he is and will return one day, slightly dirtier and more hardcore than before.Unfortunately, once again the editing is dreadful, resorting to the modern craze for 1 second or less camera shots.",4,1,2,3 January 2016
Casablanca," I bet Hemingway wished he had written it
","Casablanca was designed to encourage the USA into war against Germany in WW2. It failed wholeheartedly, but it didn't matter, the Japs and Hitler invited them in to the fray.It was also a vehicle for the stupendously subservient actress Ingrid Bergman. Her eyes water every time a male performs a miraculous act such as serving a drink or lighting a cigarette, or god forbid singing a national anthem. The use of cigarettes and booze to create an atmosphere is the primary reason why this movie is so detested today. Those habits simply don't gel with the health-conscious viewers of the 21st century. But see past that and the characters in this movie are still absorbing. Asides from Bogie, Claude Rains and Peter Lorre represent people we all know. What is a bit of mystery, is why the movie was not set in Lisbon rather than Casablanca. Lisbon was infamous as the spy capital of the war and was the historical source for Ian Fleming's James Bond romp in Casino Royale(re-located to western France in the book). Perhaps it was because it was already known that the Torch landings were to take place in Morocco.One of my favourite Bogie movies, but only 3rd behind To Have And Have Not and Key Largo. Bacall pairs up so much more effectively with Bogie than Bergman does.",9,1,4,14 April 2013
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," It's missing something...I think it's humour
","So it's been established by other reviewers that the screenplay differs from the book. That's to be expected, since the movie is intended to be watched by a large audience who haven't read the book. And Hollywood productions often insist upon a particular plot sequence.The basis of the story is a clever idea. Take a famous character from American history and place him into an entirely different genre (horror). It is saying that the horror of war isn't enough....vampires are also required to spice things up. Not a bad idea.Benjamin Walker plays the role of Abe Lincoln convincingly throughout and the other cast back him up. The action scenes are based upon the slow-mo originality provided by the Matrix and the kung-fu jinks of Chinese action movies.But this movie has a glaring fault that I'm surprised wasn't picked up during production. There is no humour in it. It has action, fear, sorrow and guilt but no humour. The lack of humour is like baking a cake without putting any icing on the top.",6,0,0,13 April 2015
Grease," Musical Masturbation
","However much sugar you coat this with, Grease is a movie about teenagers expectations for future sex. The film is essentially split into two components. The first is the pre- puberty story of boy loves girl with sugar coated candy floss. The second, the post-puberty, part of the film only takes up the last 15 minutes, is about boys and girls doing the stuff they do prior to back-seat copulation.As a musical the songs essentially come from the pages of a girlie magazine for 13 year old wannabee love hearts. But as adults we view this with nostalgia, for those days before we had to go to work, take out mortgages and bring up families of our own. It reflects that short period of exciting sexual frustration and freedom that society soon inoculates us against until we rediscover it somewhere around our mid-50's.More socially importantly, this is a movie about the beginnings of the Baby Boomer generation.",6,0,1,14 April 2013
Doctor Zhivago," For a moment happiness and then it slips through your fingers
","Undoubtedly my all time favourite movie.What is it all about? It's about failure. We live, we fail, we die. Short moments of happiness slip through our fingers into a puddle of despair.Dr Zhivago, played by Omar Sharif, is an icon of failure. His career as a doctor fails, his marriage fails, his love for Julie Christie fails, his freedom is taken from him, his country fails, his morals fail, his prominent position in life collapses. Zhivago is like all of us, whether we live in a communist country or a capitalist country, eventually society cripples us and kills us. It eats away at our aspirations and our ethics. It forces us to comply. Zhivago's final submission to society is his compliant, illegitimate daughter working for the state on a dam. You too must have experienced utter despairing failure to enjoy this movie. If you haven't lost a love one or been helpless when someone is dying, you won't get this movie. This movie lets you know that you are not alone in being pushed and shoved around by the society you live in. You are not alone in wanting something you cannot have and regretting you ever had the desire in the first place. I give it 10 out of 10 for expressing these feelings simply because there is no other movie that does it so well.",10,3,4,20 April 2013
Edward Scissorhands," Edward Scissorhands is a male homosexual
","Note to film makers - yes you can make a hit movie when you only have sentimental nonsense to work with. Edward Scissorhands proves it. You just have to direct it at the right audience.So, emotionally sensitive young man who doesn't fit into society finds friendship in a young woman and her mother. Female cosmetics are applied to his face and he learns how to cut hair and prune bushes into sculptures. However much he loves the girl he cannot have intercourse with her. And brash testosterone driven college kid hates him.So guess who Edward Scissorhands is? Obvious isn't it? He's a male homosexual. Many women would like to have a male homosexual as a friend. Kim (Winona Ryder) gets her wish.Edward Scissorhands as a monster of horror is garbed in Gothic horror and relies upon a few elements from Frankenstein and Dracula. Vincent Price adds the final touch.Tim Burton carried similar camp themes into his Batman movies.Note to audience - whenever you see Alan Arkin in a movie, it's a sign that conventions are being challenged.",6,0,2,17 March 2015
Batman Begins," 5 Seconds Of This Movie Are Great
","1. Steals a little from the origins of David Carradine's Kung Fu storyline.2. Bruce Wayne is a billionaire, so surely he can afford a sprinkler system in his mansion to prevent it burning to the ground.3. Relies heavily upon British, Irish and Dutch actors (Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy and Rutger Hauer) which is ironic considering Batman is an American idol. It's essentially a European movie.4. Some very sexy low angle shots of Katie Holme's breasts to excite the male teenage audience (and us old men).5. Ludicrous but innovative military Bat car. It could never turn a sharp corner with those wheels.6. Over complex and unnecessary plot about toxins in the city water supply that then need to be vaporised by a laser type weapon.7. Enjoyable special effects for the Scarecrow character.8. The 5 seconds when the Scarecrow sees Batman as a shark toothed bat gargoyle is how Batman should be portrayed all the time in my book. A supernatural Batman would make him truly scary.9. Compared with other super heroes, Batman is a bit weak on fire power.10. With all those skyscrapers, I kept expecting to see Spiderman swing around the corner at any moment.",5,1,4,3 March 2015
Zulu," Sentimentalism for the older Brits
","The story of the defence of Rorke's Drift is Britain's equivalent of the story of the defence of the Alamo in Texas.The 1960's saw the release of movies such as Zulu, Lawrence Of Arabia, Mutiny On The Bounty and Waterloo to satisfy British audiences of a new found sentimentalism for the days of Empire. It didn't last long as they were soon superseded by Carry On Up The Khyber and Monty Python spoofs to ridicule traditions of Empire.Since then the British Empire has been largely relegated to the role of the bad guys in Hollywood funded movies; one of the few exceptions being Master And Commander which flopped at the US box office. Only James Bond has been found acceptable because he was relocated to the Cold War.Zulu is masterpiece of British military virtues even though it fails to capture all of the historical events that took place that day. The notable exception is any Brummie accents since 46 of the soldiers were from the Birmingham district. No mention is given either of the bayoneting of injured Zulu warriors the day after the battle; revenge for the mutilation of British soldiers in the hospital. To its credit though, Zulu is one of the few war films where the enemy are shown as courageous combatants and regarded with great respect by the viewer.You probably have to be British to admire this movie in its entirety. We Brits enjoy the humour more than the battle itself. Hooky and the Colour Sergeant are such symbolic opposites of British attitudes. The scenery is spectacular and the Zulu battle chants are awesome, as is the accompanying music. Zulu is also a tribute to Stanley Baker who died in 1976. Though as Lt. Chard, Royal Engineers, he appears to be missing his best drinking friend beside him (Richard Burton), and has to rely upon young Michael Caine instead. It's a great war movie but I'm still not convinced it's the best war movie ever made.",8,0,7,20 April 2013
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Outsourcing makes sense
","Some reviewers said 'This film is just wrong and horrible' and another 'Garbage. Absolute, pure, filthy garbage.'They expected a children's movie full of innocence and instead received a horror movie.This 2005 version reminded me of the cruelty of the child-snatcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. But it's emphasis is educational. It obfuscates the industrial reality we all live in for the benefit of children. Among it's sweet candies are examples of redundancy in the work place, the loss of patent protection, the outsourcing of jobs, the issue of waste disposal and several other contemporary industrial related themes. The adults in the audience will identify most of them.In addition it tells us a little about the modern consumer. It tells us that the rich kids get everything they want and the poor kids feed upon hopes and dreams. The Golden Ticket is the Lottery Ticket, the town and factory are set in a late Victorian landscape and Willy Wonka himself has to fall in love with himself because nobody else will. The film is a very good attempt at merging many of the issues we face today in our society. It's not very good at being a children's movie since the special effects are rather tame compared with it's competitors.My personal favourite scene in the movie is the where the mechanical marionettes are used to welcome the the guests. They fail and spit fire from faulty wiring. That scene is an attempt to say 'Goodbye' to the earlier Wonka film of the 70's and usher in a new, far more brutal reality. My own criticism is that some later components in the movie tend to mirror elements in the end of the Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy movie.Note: It would have been interesting to have made the movie more sinister by casting Peter Cushing as Willy Wonka rather than as his father. Even better, Vincent Price, RIP.",8,1,2,11 June 2013
Avatar," Good movie for the kids
",1) The plot is essentially the Battle Of The Little Bighorn set in space: regimental military might invades tribal lands: tribal army wins surprise victory.2) The CGI computer wizardry will age very quickly.3) Sigourney Weaver was just collecting a pay check.4) The networked planet was essentially the internet (sigh).5) Designed for children of ages 10-14.6) The CGI removes any feeling of pain from war.7) A patchwork of ideas copied from elsewhere.8) Sets the tone for over-priced 3D movie tickets.9) Who cares about the characters (yawn it's a kids movie).10) It's not Star Wars.,4,2,4,11 April 2013
Titanic," A simple psychological script
","Titanic is not what you think it is. You think it's a flimsy love story, about a skinny lad and a dumpy girl, set against the background of an historic event in 1912.No, it's an experiment in mega-viewing. It's the Gone With The Wind of it's day. Both of them smashed box office records.This movie is about getting bums on seats, just as GWTW was. So how did they do it? (I won't tell you because it's a global trade secret in human psychology.)Nah, I'll tell you: it's the script! They did it by making every word, every line, of the script fail. At the beginning of the movie when you heard Di Caprio's friend say he was going to America ('L'AMERICA!!!'), you knew he would fail. When the owner of the liner said the ship was unsinkable, you knew those words would fail. When Billy Zane tried to bribe the crew member to get a seat on the lifeboat, you knew his words would fail. Every line of the script (ok, not absolutely every line, but most of the main character lines) resulted in failure. That, ladies and gents, in a nutshell is how you make a blockbuster movie.In GWTW, Scarlet says to Rett Butler, 'Where shall I go? What shall I do?'. He replies 'Frankly my dear I don't give a damn.' Scarlet's words fail. In Titanic, Jacks final words to Rose as he dies of cold are 'Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.' Err...that's nonsense. He's dying. He even jokes 'I don't know about you, but I intend to write a strongly worded letter to the White Star Line about all this.' Err..fail.If you want to know more, and there is more, just send a blank check to....me.",9,1,4,11 April 2013
Burlesque," Stylish But Predictable
","Several attempts have been made to re-create stories based upon The Star Is Born. A few of those have been based upon Burlesque theatrical dance. This movie is one of them. The burlesque style is essentially women dressed as prostitutes dancing provocatively on stage without exposing their bits.As a movie showcase for Christina Aguilera songs it succeeds. Christina is sweet then raunchy and performs her routines with the high quality visual sexiness we have come to expect from her music videos. This movie came after her Back To Basics album which explored a variety of 20th century dance and singing themes. In the movie she is joined by Cher as the club owner, who in my opinion, has the best ballad in the movie.In spite of the raunchiness, this is a movie directed at the female audience rather than at the boys. It is about woman having fun dressing up, applying their make-up and enticing men around their little fingers. There are no doormen throwing out troublemakers from the club and no fist fights let alone a gun. This is the opposite of say Roadhouse. Humour is provided superbly by Stanley Tucci.The song and dance acts are stylish, however the plot of the story is tediously predictable. You won't find a single surprise in this movie.Burlesque scores highly for it's imagery but it falls far short of the movie Cabaret as a story. Burlesque plays safe whilst Cabaret was a lot more edgy.",5,0,2,11 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It's all because of Jimmy Carter and his peanuts
","Both Star Wars and Star Trek are not movies about the future, but about the past.Star Trek relies upon the adventures of Captain Cook (even down to red uniforms for the marines, the ones who always get shot). Star Wars relies upon the tales of Medieval Europe.Someone once told me that the white clad troopers in Star Wars were based upon Nazi storm troopers. Err...this is nonsense. Nazi storm troopers rape and pillaged on a mass scale, neither of which are evident in this movie. The white troopers are the equivalent of medieval crossbowmen; skilled fighters but far below the heraldic level of knights (Jedi Knights).Star wars is a variant of a late medieval version of Camelot but set in Jerusalem during the Crusades, with Luke Skywalker playing the role of Arthur, Obi Wan Kenobi playing the role of Merlin and Hans Solo playing the role of Lancelot. The robot R2D2 is the court jester and C3Po is a serf. Darth Vader is Saladin, the enemy of the white Christian Knights. Princess Leia is a dose of women's lib thrown in for good measure.'Feel the force Luke' is the most putrid sickening phrase of the whole movie. It comes straight out of the late 1970's disco scene and is laced with homo-eroticism. 'Feel the force.' says monkish Obi Wan to his young male student with a twinkle in his eye. It sounds like the advice of Catholic priest to his preferred choir boy. So I ask myself, why did this movie became so successful? We know up until this point that sci-fi movies were largely serious affairs: 2001 and Silent Running just two examples. Prior to Star Wars the most successful sci-fi movie had been Planet Of The Apes. Is the re-direction from these genres sufficient to explain the success of Star Wars? Probably not. I believe the true answer lies in the year it was made and the political environment of that year. Jimmy Carter was the president and he was pushing for economic austerity in the use of energy supplies. Driving speed limits were 55mph and the Saudis were in control of most of the US energy supplies(note Darth Vader = Saladin).Along comes Star Wars where energy usage is limitless. There's plentiful energy for a Death Star, space buggies, robots, laser swords and space fighters. Nobody in the movie is concerned about how much energy they are employing. And the movie doesn't explain where the energy comes from...unless it's that homo-erotic Force? Energy is apparently limitless. No driving speed restrictions, no queues at the pump for your space buggy. Put away those energy efficient, slow moving space ships in 2001 and Silent Running. No need to ride a horse as in Planet Of The Apes.The audience felt a sense of relief from Carter's energy austerity. Soon they would actually get it when they voted for Jedi Knight Reagan and his 'Star Wars' program.",2,1,7,20 April 2013
300," A metaphor for modern times
","We could argue all day and night about the historical inaccuracies of this movie, but there is little point in doing so, since the record of the Persian Wars relies upon the investigations of Herodotus. '300' has much more to say about the modern times we live in than it does about the Hellenic conflict with Persia. 300 'western' men face the hordes of the East. This is a metaphor for the economic crisis western developed nations have faced over recent decades as the lands of the East have regained their confidence and challenged western supremacy.Sparta was no democracy. There are no Athenians in 300. No Pericles or Cleisthenes to enable the 300 to vote on the best course of action. Leonidas was a king of Sparta but in 300 he represents the contemporary CEO of a western corporation, standing firm to resist the onslaught of Eastern economies on his homeland.This is a movie, an action movie, a CGI movie, that provides a statement on the difficulties we in the west face today, right now. Do we give in to the economic dominance of China, Japan, Korea and India, or do we fight and fight hard to the last man standing. The Greeks won their wars against the East. Shall we do the same?",7,0,2,11 April 2013
Fantastic Four," Pleasant but not satisfying
","The problem with the existing Fantastic Four movies is that they follow the comic books too closely. As a result there are very few surprises. The biggest surprise is the employment of Jessica Alba as Sue Storm, turning this character into a sexually enticing superhero; resorting to near nakedness in at least one scene. As a result it has a slight whiff of the Carry On's about it. It could be Barbara Windsor playing the part of a cockney Sue Storm. Julian McMahon makes an admirable attempt at playing Victor Von Doom, particularly in the use of his vocal range and hand movements. He could easily be mistaken for a sinister version of Captain Von Trapp in the Sound Of Music.Ioan Gruffudd excels theatrically as the socially inhibited Reed Richards. But lets face it, we watch the Fantastic Four to see The Thing. And Michael Chiklis has the most memorable moment in the movie as The Thing when he is tricked by the motives of a humble pigeon on Brooklyn Bridge.Chris Evans turn out to be the traitor among the cast, ditching his 'Flame On' repertoire for a new Star Spangled uniform as Cpt. America.Worth watching but really it's just an introduction to the characters.",6,0,2,11 April 2013
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Predictable And Disappointing
","Plot: It's not made clear why any of the characters is after the Holy Grail. In the tank scene Indy has his bag strap caught around the barrel of the gun and is unable to release it. But after escaping from being crushed by a rock, his bag strap suddenly no longer restricts his movement. In the invisible bridge scene he crosses the bridge on faith alone and then scatters dirt to reveal the bridge. He could have used dirt to reveal the bridge in the first place. In another escape scene Indy drives away with his father on a motorbike with side car. But he doesn't wait for the Germans in the boat to motor off the shore. There are only two sections of the story that involve the Holy Grail. The rest of the story is once again about Nazi Germany. In general, the story relies too much upon comedy to see it through.Characters: Predominantly male dominated. The only female is a young woman who sleeps around without contraception and yet miraculously fails to get pregnant. Is she a Nazi, isn't she a Nazi? Even she doesn't know. The 700 year old crusader knight was particularly unconvincing and looked like he was in the wrong movie. Perhaps he thought he was in Monty Python's The Holy Grail. Connery's character struggles to portray Indy's father. Acting: Harrison Ford's facial expressions are well rehearsed by now and used in every scene. Connery normally relies upon his deep smooth voice but it sounds weak in this movie.Scenery And Props: The tank was very odd. A WW1 British tank with a turret being employed by the Germans. Even odder was it's speed of 20mph. Most WW1 British tanks could barely manage 5mph. The final location of Petra in Jordan now looks unconvincing considering we know it has no affiliation with Christianity.Conclusion: A hash of old ideas and a bit of a disappointment. Once again relied heavily upon the Germans as an opponent where the opportunity was there to introduce new adversaries such as the Knights Templar or another religious sect.Best Scene: The No Ticket scene on the zeppelin.",4,2,7,16 August 2015
Goodfellas," Great characters, but no message
","Goodfellas is a joy to watch. Joe Pesci is in his comfort zone playing a tetchy little New York Mafiosa hard man. De Niro almost takes a backseat to Pesci. Liotta, as raconteur, delivers the story pitch perfect.So why only 5 out of 10 ('bing a bang')?The characterisations are marvellous but the message is an empty bag. The message is merely that 'might is right' and life is short. The bigger you are, the more friends you have, the more weight you can throw around. Well, we know that. We knew that when a nuke was dropped on Hiroshima.There is no sincere message from the movie. There are plenty of lovable characters but nothing else to feed us. You get more, much more, from Allen's Broadway Danny Rose. From the Godfather you learn about the organisation of the underworld.However, they say movies are more about character than plot. Maybe that applies to the message too. It's good. It's fun. But you don't learn anything from it other than a few syllables that every other kid at college would know. In Goodfellas, life is so simple it's makes me wonder why I bother to pay my bills.",5,4,8,11 April 2013
The Godfather," The Sicilian Way doesn't work in the Anglo-Saxon world
","If you lived in Sicily over the last 3,000 years you'd be pretty used to death and devastation by now. Sicily is bang smack in the middle of three prominent pre-Christian empires: the Greek post-Alexander Hellenistic empire, the Roman Empire and the Carthagian-Lavantine Empire. All three of them fought tooth and nail for 3 centuries to control Sicily. And I haven't mentioned yet the tyrants who used to rule Sicilian cities such as Syracuse, for whom the Greek engineer Archimedes worked. Then came the bully-boy, Normans, the Hapsburg Empire, Napoleon, Mussolini, the Nazis...oh where does it end?In other words, dying, or threatening others with death, is just something else to do on a Sunday afternoon in Sicily. The Sicilians also learnt how to barter with their masters of the day, and how to subjugate their own.Transfer all of this to a quiet neighbourhood of New York City, and it's like trusting King Kong into the city to clean the windows of the Empire State Building. The Godfather, adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, shows how capable the Sicilian Mafia are at subduing the authorities to run their own profiteering rackets. But what's interesting is how after the Godfather was shown, how the authorities decided they had had enough of being manipulated by Sicilians. It wasn't long before they put every effort into suppressing these usurpers. The US authorities regained the role the Greeks, Romans and Carthagians had once held.Sicilian management is impressive, but not as impressive as good old Dutch-Anglo-Saxon mastery of all things profitable.A point of interest, the decapitation of the horse-head scene in this movie has its foundation in Roman Chariot racing on The Field Of Mars. One of the winning horses would be sacrificed, it's blood mixed with the bodies of the unborn children and its head nailed to the door of the Forum.",8,1,2,20 April 2013
