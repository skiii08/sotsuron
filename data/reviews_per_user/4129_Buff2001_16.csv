The Legend of Bagger Vance," It's Metaphysics 101
","If you think this movie is about golf you probably don't know what metaphysics is. Metaphysics is about things that are beyond our limited physical world. There are an increasing number of people who believe in metaphysics which has its roots in Eastern philosophies. By far and away the largest number of openly practicing metaphysicians are in California with the Los Angeles area having many large metaphysical churches.Over the years I have noticed metaphysics creeping into more and more film plots, overtly in 'Powder' and 'Phenomenon' and more subtly in the seemingly violent and gory 'Gladiator.'Bagger Vance could well be shown in a Metaphysics 101 class. All of the basics are there - the Force is within us - Each has to find their own path - as you really believe, so it is - our souls live on (as in Titanic's theme song) - you have to get out of the way and let the Force (in this case the Field) take over - and of course from decades ago, the Force is with us always.Whether the teacher appears as an old bearded white guy named Obi or a young black guy named Bagger is relevant only to illustrate that it is not the surface, but what lies beneath, that is real. If you happen to be tuned in to any form of metaphysics at all, DO NOT MISS this wonderful film.  If you are firmly rooted in this earthly reality, you will probably see Bagger Vance as a boring, ridiculous movie about golf. You will find plenty of comments posted here to support that position.Regardless of your own philosophical, spiritual leanings, you should find the film well directed, well acted, well photographed, and well scored. If you pay close attention, you might even catch some insights of Truth.",10,0,1,6 November 2000
Training Day," Give me a break!
","I got this DVD to see what it was that Denxel Washington did that was so much better that other roles he has played outstandingly. What a disappointment! Consider Denzel's Oscar this year for his body of work, to open the door for more non-white winners, to avoid the threatened botcott, or whatever but puleeze - not for his outstanding performance in this run of the mill violent cop flick. I am reminded of Sylvester Stallone in Copland which was a much better film in this overworked genre. Denzel's performance unfortunately did not add much.By contrast, Will Smith was robbed because his performance as Ali was great and different. Sean Penn was no Dustin Hoffman but did better than Denzel. And of course, in spite of his off screen behaviour and like him or not, Russell Crowe was the best in A Beautiful Mind.Don't waste your time on this film, that is unless you want to see the real Best Supporting Actor performance, a really great turn by Ethan Hawke.",2,30,63,26 March 2002
Memento," Not entertainment in my book!
","I suppose there are two kinds of movie watchers. Those that watch to be entertained, to see good photography and to feel really good at the end of the experience. That's me. Then there are those that do not like the trite, formula movies I love, but rather enjoy being jerked around with something violent, morose, moralistic but above all - different. That definitely includes all critics and apparently most voters on this site. If you fit this latter description Memento is a must.If you want entertainment, then skip this for sure. I am glad I got a 2 for 1 at BB Video so I did not waste any money on this drivel. Yeh, yeh -- I know it was different, novel, and ground breaking. But for me the ground it broke was the grave I toss it in. If they ever compile a movie of segments of recently acclaimed downer films like this (and many others), it sure should not be called 'That's Entertainment X.'",1,10,19,16 February 2002
Pearl Harbor," For my money, this is right on target!
","Contains spoiler!I am compelled to write something positive since there are so many negative comments posted here.  My guess is that they were written by people who simply do not relate at all to real events or understand how Hollywood should portray them.  Also I would guess that most are written by people who were not alive when it all happened.Compared to Private Ryan and Titanic, this is better.  It is better entertainment.  It does not grind your nose in the gore.  It does portray rather accurately the moods and feelings of the time, and I know because I WAS alive then.  A little too young to have participated but old enough to be seriously affected and to know what was going on.Yes, Tora and Midway are great documentaries and the more personalized 30 Seconds over Tokyo were good movies for their time.  But this combines the best of all those films with the movie technology of today and I found the results outstanding.The love story was much better and more likely than Titanic's contrived unlikely pairing of a steerage passenger with a first class passenger. And Fatso Kate of Titanic does not hold a candle to Pearl's Kate.  Leanardo DeCrapio also is not in the same league as Affleck and Hartnet.The concept of two people getting together after thinking a common person has been killed is very real. A close personal friend of mine was shot down in Viet Nam and after four years was presumed dead.  His wife was granted a divorce and married one of his squadron members.  When the POWs were released in 1973 he was among them. He subsequently married the wife of a squadron member who was killed in action.Compared to CTHD or all the other forgettable films of 2000, this is a real crowd pleaser from my point of view, certainly the best of 2001 so far!",10,0,2,28 May 2001
Remember the Titans," Outstanding film!!
","Although I really enjoyed this film when I saw it in the theater, I found the DVD version even better.  If you do not have a home theater setup with 5.1 surround sound and good speakers, then start saving your pennies for one.  The sound in a small room is fabulous and you feel like you are right in the action.  Further there are two commentary tracks - one by the director and one by the real people - the two coaches who lived the real life story. I was amazed how much the real coaches sounded like the people who portrayed them on screen.  I was also very impressed that the coaches said that almost all the story was accurately converted to film.  They point out a few small differences and why - e.g. The white coach had four daughters, not just the one, and the one was not quite as outspoken and involved in real life.  But most all the rest was accurate. the coaches even commented on how well the actors resembled and acted like the real people. Sounds to me like the head of casting for this great sports flick deserves an A+++.",9,0,0,5 April 2001
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Absurdly unreal and over the top!
","If you like this kind of action film featuring everything that utilizes the latest in filming technology, then you will enjoy this. Obviously based on the 33,300 plus votes, a whole lot of you rate this right up there with the truly good movies. Close analysis reveals that the target audience is extremely unbalanced with males, especially those age 18 to 44. While people over 45 constitute a large potential audience, only 1264 rated this film.If you are 45 or over, you might want to evaluate my own review. I am 77 and been a movie buff for 65 years. I have seen black and white, Cinerama, CinemaScope, 360 (as at Epcot), IMAX in Smithsonian, and many other places, and 3-D at a number of amusement parks. I thoroughly enjoyed all of these leading edge technologies, primarily because of the technology plus they portrayed real people doing real things.I went to our local 12plex because they had remodeled two of the 12 theaters to show IMAX and 3D. Not wanting to see animated films, we finally saw this one because I did enjoy the original MI TV series.This was in my opinion a terrible script depicting old James Bond movies with regard to primary plot. You have to suspend judgement to even come close to relating to the film.As it turned out the theater had installed a crystal clear screen and projecting equipment. The real problem for me was this ultra good sound system. For about half of the rather long film the sound system was running at full blast. Most involved showing something on the screen that literally shook the theater. It was impressive , at first, but got to be very old and disturbing.For older folks I suggest you pass on this. They have 3-D digital TV systems that you have control of. You won't be seeing movies anything like How the West was Won, Sound of Music, etc. in this era and media.",2,20,41,31 December 2011
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Give me a break!
","Yes the cinematography and special effects were excellent, but forgive me for probably being politically incorrect, but I like American movies, period.  For a while we were subjected to a series of supposedly good English movies that were barely understandable.  Then there were a series of Australian movies that were supposed to be great.  I guess it is Chinese time now.There is no way this lame movie should be even mentioned in the same sentence with Gladiator, Titanic, As Good as it Gets, etc, etc.  Sure it deserves to be given the oscar for best FORIEGN film of the year - but best picture of the year - Give me a break!!No matter how many oscars this movie happens to win, don't see it with high expectations.  It just does not cut it for me and yes, I did understand all the multiple plots and subplots, and yes I appreciate, and practice, eastern philosophies including meditation.  But this movie does not have any real depth.  It is simply a female Bruce Lee movie.  Go at your own risk. 
I am disappointed that people on this site have rated this film #10 all time.  That is the most ridiculous thing I can imagine!! Absurdity reigns!",1,6,14,22 March 2001
Mulholland Drive," That's entertainment???
","Increasingly I suppose in order to get a good rating a movie has to be different, even if it makes hardly any sense at all and what sense that may be devined from it has to be very dark, negative, abberant and violent with no obvious redeeming value.Mulholland Drive sure fits this bill. If this is art reflecting society then I fear for its existence. For my remaining relatively few years on this planet, I will choose to see the good old movies that had a plot a reasonable person could follow and an ending that made you feel at good in some respect.If you like decent movies, don't even bother with this one on Video.",1,4,10,11 May 2002
For Love of the Game," The best of Costner's sports efforts - a home run
","I liked all the other Costner sports flicks a lot (It is his forte), but For the Love of the Game is tops! Bull Durham was a whole lot of baseball with a dose of romantic comedy. Field of Dreams was 100% baseball fantasy-drama. The current effort is a perfect mix of baseball and romance. It is really two movies woven skillfully into one which accounts for its relatively long runtime(137)for a film of this genre.This is easily Costner's best effort in a long time and Kelly Preston is perfect opposite him. It's funny but every time I see Bull Durham again, the fact that Sarandon is now 'with' Tim Robbins destroys the Sarandon-Costner chemistry for me. Fortunately Travolta is nowhere to be seen, so the Preston-Costner mix plays very well, especially since it is heavy on romance and very light on sex.This is one of those movies I walk out of wondering what it was that caused it to be PG-13.  No drugs, not a hint of violence, and no nudity.  In retrospect, I suppose there was a gratuitous swear word or two at most and what romance doesn't have a suggestion of sex.  For my money this is more G rated than what you see on network sit-coms these days, especially Fox. Take the family and enjoy!!!",10,0,0,20 September 1999
The Greatest Game Ever Played," A disappointment to me
","I went to this movie with great expectations. That's never a good ides and was especially so in this disappointing film. First of all the only spoiler I can tell you is that there are no spoilers! If you have seen the trailers and know the true story, then that's it.The golfing scenes take up way to much time and are a very poor knock of the scenes from Legend of Bagger Vance, my gold standard for sports movies in general and golf movies specifically. Photograohy is mediocre, the story line is very weak, trite and not well developed and the acting very average or worse.With no star power I expected a great story line and directing. Unfortunately the acting, if you can call it that, was akin to a bunch of extras and C-level actors struggling for something that was simply not there. Too bad Bill Paxton did not appear in the movie instead of his son. Bill should give up directing and stick to acting! The sparse 'love story' is given very little development and absolutely NO denouement. The 'what happened to statements' printed at the end provide incomplete closure at best.",3,7,18,30 September 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Comedy?? Excuse me!
","I suppose I have to be classified a contrarian now because I like the way movies once were. These days it seems by far the vast majority of the films the critics rave about are ones that are 'different'. Movies that are there just for enjoyment just don't seem to get made as often these days.I missed this film because it only played at our local art theater. I never do see anything there because the movies are always given extremely favorable ratings but are always lousy (IMHO) films from an enjoyment standpoint.I finally broke down and rented the DVD of this because of the number of Golden Globe nominations and good stars involved. When will I ever learn that if it is considered great by the critics and the 'in crowd' in Hollywood, it is practically guaranteed to be a waste of time as entertainment. If I could give a zero rating, this would get it for sure. The fact it is so high in the IMDb all time ratings is to me a sad commentary on the state of our world.I may be old and I may come from another era but one thing I know for sure. By definition a comedy is supposed to be funny, like ha-ha laugh out loud funny - especially if it has Jim Carrey. To classify Spotless Mind as a comedy requires someone with a very twisted mind indeed. I can concede the acting was good and that it was well filmed and quite different. There is no way however that it is a comedy. Comedy is Chaplin, Abbot & Costello, Lemmon and Matthau, et. al.If you are expecting to laugh or find anything funny in this piece of trash, save your time and money. I suppose they are making so few real comedies now that they have to stretch like Jim Carrey in Mask to call fantasy/sci-fi drama a comedy.",1,12,31,22 January 2005
Pretty Woman," If you liked the video you will LOVE the DVD!
","Pretty Woman has always been one of my favorite movies - a more mature role for Richard Gere than Officer and a Gentleman and the breakout movie for Julia Roberts, who shares my home town of Smyrna, GA. 
Now that I have a complete DVD home theater setup, the 10th anniversary DVD is a must have.  Garry Marshall's run through of the entire movie with commentary is fabulous and chock full of new information to me. He points out where in the movie his son, daughter, Penny's daughter and he himself briefly appear.  This is just a sample of a whole lot of inside info you will hear when you get the new DVD.You can forget the critic's ratings,  The fact that this 14 million dollar movie has earned over a half Billion dollars worldwide is a testament to its greatness.",10,0,2,12 April 2000
A Beautiful Mind," An Actor - Director's movie
","Clearly this film will likely win a lot of awards. Russell Crowe does a better job than Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. Ron Howard WILL finally get the Oscar he deserves. A solid 10 for both.BUT, as entertainment, the movie is a loser. I still prefer to spend my money and come our feeling good, rather than come out admiring the work of the artists.",5,0,1,3 January 2002
Love Actually," Best Ever
","I could not believe that I could ever sit through a romantic comedy/drama of this length but I did and enjoyed every single minute of it. I personally thought all the stories were very well done, cut and edited very well and blended to form an artistic montage of love at many, many levels - some I had never considered.I loved the music, the portrayals, the filming, everything. I would have to say this is one of the best, if not THE best, of this genre I have ever seen.Don't miss it!",10,0,2,16 November 2003
Bruce Almighty," Great entertainment!!
","Jim Carey is back on the beam in this movie that keeps the house in almost continuous laughter, which I am told is good for the body and soul.Morgan Freeman gives the best portrayal of God since George Burns.I suppose if you like Friends, you will enjoy Anniston in this movie. She does not do it for me, however my own personal favorite TV actress, Catherine Bell, JAG's female lead comes off great in this movie giving a real good performance in a small role against the tough type she has been displaying recently on JAG.I highly recommend this great comedy!",9,0,1,24 May 2003
The Sixth Sense," It's not horror, it's metaphysics!
","I am glad this movie got such high marks, but from the comments this mostly relates to the acting and the ending. This, plus the music and cinematography are outstanding but that is not what really made it with me.I never see junky horror films and that is what I thought this was until some of my metaphysical friends clued me in that it was a great movie. Metaphysics is the belief in things unseen including the entire premise of this movie.I am a licensed practitioner of metaphysics and this absolutely beautiful movie is a primer on beliefs held by many in the metaphysical community, which not coincidentally is centered in California, with Arizona and Florida following.The entire movie is a wonderful example of how the Creator ultimately weaves everything together in the right and perfect fashion.  Every piece fits like a glove in the tapestry of eternal, unending life.If you liked Powder, Phenomenon, Defending Your Life, Ghost, or any of a host of films like that, don't miss this one!While it sure is not 'horror', Sixth Sense could be described by many as 'fantasy'.  For me, it is a picture of a very real possibility. The underlying concept of people floating around trying to work out unresolved issues before 'moving on' may be scary to some and probably way beyond the realm of possibility for most. In any case, this movie does a superb job of painting a tapestry that most metaphysicians would quickly recognize and love.",10,0,0,24 September 1999
