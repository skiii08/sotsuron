Minority Report," Overly done and Predictable
","Dull and predictable. The predictable Speilberg special effects got tiring by the end. If the Speilberg name hadn't been associated with it, it might have been a flop. Overly long. It was fine for the first 1/2 hour or so, then soon became transparent, redundant and predictable.",1,5,9,27 July 2002
Scary Movie 2," Excellent, Dude
",Best humor film I've seen in years. Even better than Scary Movie (#1). The Priest scene alone is worth the price of the movie. Great parodies throughout of various famous 'horror' movies. great way to laugh at some of your favorite horror flicks.,10,1,3,27 July 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," See the IMAX version, otherwise wait for the DVD
","I live in a city with and IMAX theatre playing the film. The animation in IMAX is super. However,the plot is predictable and a rehash of the previous 2 in the series. The show I attended at the IMAX was at 1 AM but was sold out over a day previous, so if going to IMAX, consider buying tickets in advance. Film is overly long, so if your rear is tired from sitting through the overly long rehash, leave when the credits start, there is no secret or special clip this time at the end after the credits.",5,0,0,6 November 2003
