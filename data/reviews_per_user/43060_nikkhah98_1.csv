Requiem for a Dream," This movie is not all about the addiction.
","If you see this movie as you see other typical movies, you will be amazed by its acting performances, its directing, editing, dialog and the meaning of it. But the meaning of the movie for many people is just that addiction is not a good way to reach the end in life, Of course it is not. But the way that the writer of the book and the director(which is the screenwriter himself) see the meaning is not just that. That is a word that every healthy person know, and that's why many people don't get it and they don't like it because of that. The true meaning in my opinion is the wrong targets of people lives. Addiction is one of them yes, but the whole meaning is much more than that. When you really need 'something' you'll try to reach it an it will become a life goal for you. Characters in the movie wanted and needed different things, but they all had something in common and it was to be satisfied of the way they life goes. But non of them was. Each of them tried to reach it in a wrong way and for all of them it caused addiction. As it wasn't the right way they all lost life at the end.The right way was much more easier as they talk about it and be it in some moments but still they want to do the wrong way. And the dream of all of them never came true. Helpful points we can get from this movie is not only to not getting into addiction but in bigger way, it's about to chose the way to reach what we want correctly and do not go the way that we just 'think' is correct if we want to reach the target of our lives.",10,1,2,6 December 2013
