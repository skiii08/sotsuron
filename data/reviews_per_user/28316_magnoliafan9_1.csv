The Ring," HUmmmmmm.
","What do i have to say about this movie? Leme think. First this was a pretty good movie and was full of mysterious parts. Now the actors, the little boy was weird, the lady was weird, and that guy(dont know who he is though) was weird. they were all ok actors but a little weird at some parts. How about one of the movie quotes 'First u watch the tape, then the phone rings and the little girl says You'll die in seven days. So six days go by since these kids watch the tape. All 4 of them think its all a bunch of bull, and that someone it trying to pplay a prank on them. On the seven day they all are at home and at the same time all of the die. Some say that someone killed them, but no marks anywhere, others say that it was that they were scared to death. But the one truth will be known. The movie scared them to death.' Or something like that. One freakish sceen is when she fell in the well and a hand grabbed here arm. She thinks it is over but it is still happening. Her son already told her that she cant be helped. Ok movie not one of my top i thoguht it was a little freaky.",Null,0,1,24 November 2003
