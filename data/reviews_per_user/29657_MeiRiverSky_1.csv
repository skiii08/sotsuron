The Ring," Greatest horror flick of today's world
","Oh my god....this movie was too good.  I consider myself a pretty big movie buff, by working at circuit city and best buy in their movie department for 3 years and owning well over 200 hundred movies, and i've never seen a movie like this.  i've been able to withstand the shining, halloween, blair witch, and even the fabulous IT, without even a flinch.  this movie had me on the edge of my seat and I even jumped at those extreme freaky points. mentioning any part of this movie will take away from the film, but if you are up to a scare....the ring is out there for ya.  and it always will be *queue scary music.",Null,0,0,7 November 2002
