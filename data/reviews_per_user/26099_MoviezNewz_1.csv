Black Swan," Amazing
","This movie is pure art, and Natalie is just perfect, Mila is not my favorite tough, and Winona...well I would have liked to see her in a stronger role.Natalie have been always a favorite of mine, I mean she is great in 'The professional', Closer and even Star wars, so this movie was her destiny, she actually looks like a beautiful swan, and she can represent this dark notes of the character. It was cool to see Toby Hemingway but his role...well not to exciting, he is a great actor and they could use him in a better and juicy way.The last sequence is dramatic and dark but i really didn't like the end, is kinda flat, i mean the final dance and the blood in the stomach is great, but Natalie just resting in the floor is not enough.In general Natalie is gorgeous just as her acting, the script, photography, music and clothes is a perfect 10.",10,1,2,6 June 2014
