Blade Runner 2049," Not a good movie...just people/business hyping it up better than it is for $$$
","I always gave the original Blade Runner 10/10. Seen it a over a 1000 times including at the movie theater. Good pace, visuals, music, likable characters, bad guys. Yup, pretty much everything. One of my top 10 movies of all time. This review for 2049 is not because it should be the same thing or make it over the top.OK now this Blade Runner 2049. Bad boring. Where nothing really means much. Unlikable characters, music is 'meh' nothing unique(A poor version of the original_. Bad people in this, who cares? Bring us back with someone who is actually a threat(like Roy). We have some stupid terminator woman who really just flat out sucks. Poor casting. Jared Leto sucks. Yeah, he really does. Then you have the black guy with a cane from walking dead, who talks to everyone sideways. Who talks to people sideways? Why did you cast him? I've never see someone in any other movie, show or real life talk to people when they are not looking at them. Fail!!! I thought it was stupid in walking dead and now its really stupid. Plot is blah. Oh, it's also like a journey for Ryan Gosling to go from one Cameo to another with another boring scene. Not much vocab, emotion. Even Roy in the original had TONS of emotion and even had poetry at the end when he decided to turn a corner and save life instead of destroying everything in his path.Harrison Ford is just an old man in this(sorry to say). Think it's time to retire. Did nothing in this film except hold a gun in Ryan's face and get captured with handcuffs.Do not believe the hype, not a good movie.",1,202,387,8 October 2017
It," Boring, stupid, maybe scary if you're 5 years old, not entertaining
","The classic one had at least personality, funny, and witty. This was a complete bore with just a collection of clown scenes. Most of the movie is how kids play. Jumping of cliffs into water, playing in the grass and some typical bullies being bullies with a clown that's absolutely boring with no personality(unlike the original) Oh, and you have the annoying part of some kid saying, 'youll float too' like off the trailer over and way over again. Yup, really scary(sarcasm) No lie, the clown looks really stupid and fake also.As usual people(sheep) hyping the movie up more than it is.Do not recommend unless you wanna fall asleep to a movie.",1,2,6,19 October 2017
Captain Marvel," I really did see this movie and it's sub-par
","People who review this movie 7 or above either works for the movie industry or something related. This is not a good movie. While it's not a 10, it's not a 1 either. I rarely see either of both.The story/plot is extremely boring. It's nothing you haven't seen before. The first half is very long and boring. Captain Marvel is a Mary Sue at the start and she is one at the end glowing skin and glowing eyes. She really does not have any personality. I almost felt like she was a robot that speaks. Brie Larson is miscast.Ruined previous Marvel time line in every way. Cat really does scratch out Fury's eye. The enemy is the evil 'white man' theme again and we are friends with goblins that change. Yup, amazing. The final movie scene with 'I'm just a girl' from No Doubt is just sad.I do not recommend for kids since it may make them dumber.
I do not recommend for adults since you have to numb your brain of how stupid and boring this movie really is.
I do not recommend listening to critics that actually recommend this garbage. That means they are just serving the movie industry and their own agendas.You have been warned this is a waste of time and money if you care for either.Verdict 3/10",3,54,104,10 March 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," No falsely hyping this movie up like people usually do with movies today
","Yup, it's a great movie. Best movie I've seen for a very long time because most movies today are copies, boring and pathetic. Sit back and relax for a good time. If I had any complaints at all which is not a big deal I thought Tessa Thompson should not be in the film. Feels more like a miscast, has a big part of the film, and cheesy. I think someone else could of done a way better job but it's not a big deal.",10,48,85,1 November 2017
Suicide Squad," This movie just sucks
","The best scene is the first 5 mins when the security guard is messing with Will Smith and Harley.Overuse of musicJoker and his 10 mins are completely useless. On the trailer I find it funny they advertise the joker being such a mean head guy when he isn't. Its some silly witch. The trailer is all joker coming in the scenes. Far from that. In those 10 mins hes in the movie, its almost all flashbacks.90% of the movie is Will Smith and Harley. Oh and they keep saying how Harley is craziest because shes a woman like the Hollywood trying to advertise pro woman crap. Most of the movie shes just giggling, saying 'what' or her lines or just so out of place it doesn't fit the movie. Also, her accent is going in and out of the film.Fighting scenes- very boring also camera shots bouncing every half second.Plot - useless. At least put some twists in it(not very hard) bad person escapes and wants to blow up the world. gather will smith and harley to stop it. Oh, diablo crying how he cant do his power anymore half the movie besides Harley giggling... thats 95 percent of the movie.This movie is just flat out bad and so boring. I wanted to fall asleep...",1,5,8,16 August 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," Honest review. Not a good movie...I want my money and life back.
","Depressing? Check. Zero plot? Check. Do I want to use my free time to enjoy a depressing movie as a form of entertainment? No.I can sum up this movie in a few lines:1)We are getting the band back together.2)CGI mess3)No twist, nothing special. Very linear. 4)Every one of your heros just suck not using their main strengths5)Make every hero stupid and fail.6)Over dramatized for not caring about the heros because they are that dumb.Pretty much just hand over the stones and die. Thanks for the multi billion dollars for this poor developed story and movie. Anyone that tells you, 'it's good' is for sure lying and just hyping it just what the business wants. Seriously, not good. I've seen all the Marvel movies and this one is just action follow by drama garbage. Can you guys just make another 'Winter solider' movie? I really don't mind waiting a over a year for the next one to rent it on Netflix with the dribble I just saw. I gave it a one because I just felt like I saw nothingness and stupidity at it's finest.The end.",1,7,36,28 April 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," Worst movie out of the trilogy!!!!!!BORING!!!!
","Movie was so boring I wanted to walk out of the movie cinema. Usual lets bring bad guy back, find some other bad guys, destroy the world with mind numbing blah. No twists. No nothing. Predictable trash. The first hour was the concept of 'Hi' 'Hello' and we are bringing the band back together.Jean Grey(Stark) was miscast. Why was she in this movie? The acting was poor. And of course Ms. Jennifer Lawrence giving me a Hunger games weak speech at the end. Jennifer Lawrence is not even that talented of an actress but Hollywood is trying so hard with her. She hardly does anything in this movie and just says, 'fight' over and over. Raven didn't even do anything.'Magneto, you're not bad, you're good' from Prof. X. I'm thinking, 'Yes, I have the point'. I wish Magneto woulda zapped a coin threw my head at this point. The final scene had him floating for a half hour wondering if he should fight. WTF He did nothing. Or and the fantastic four combine their powers to defeat this stargate joke. I do not recommend. Anyone that said they liked it doesn't know anything about quality. I did like the other two xmen before this. Mostly, 'Days of future Past'. This is as disappointing as 'Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull'. If you do decide to see this movie, I already feel sorry for you. Just give me your 10$ and I just saved almost 3 hours of your life. It was bad...",1,136,265,27 May 2016
Logan," Awful movie. Great of you like whining and complaining for 2 hours.
","Yup, and everyone dies. The end. Oh, I have to write more. These movies are getting worse and worse. If someone is writing a good review for this movie they are feeding of the hype. Even the story is boring and the it's so desperate they cloned wolverine. I really don't know what it is with Hollywood and bringing little kids in the movie that are annoying. Characters were so bad I didn't even care they died. I felt nothing during this entire movie it was so bad. More boring? Wait, while you're at it why not bring in monkeys?",1,27,60,7 March 2017
The Nice Guys," Great Movie. Replay value - High
","Good movie...the end. Funny, smart, original and all that jazz.",10,2,3,8 March 2020
