Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is a truly over hyped and disappointing film.
","What on earth was the point of this film? I have to admit that the special effects in this film are quite breathtaking but that is about it. I found myself truly irritated by the character of Jar Jar Binks, the acting from all of the lead roles was laughably bad and the plot was kind of flat. But, if you're a true star wars fan, nothing that anyone say will stop you seeing this movie so whatever I or anyone else says is irrelevant. Just remember, it IS just a light piece of fun for kids.",Null,0,1,16 July 1999
