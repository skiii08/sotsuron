Ali," Horrendous
","(One possible minor spoiler)I have only stopped watching a movie because it was so bad only once (Blade Runner) but this movie came pretty close. Almost every aspect of this movie was extrodinarily dissapointing and horrible. The only possible bright spot in the movie was Will Smith's portrayl of Ali, which was pretty good. However, the rest of the movie was disspicable.First, the annoying music in the background didn't add dramatic effect of any effect other then that of pure annucence. Secondly, there were so many dull and way too slow scenes that could have been easily cut without losing any of the movie. Next, Howard Cossel, played by Jon Voight, was played way too stiffly. Also, the beginning portion of the movie involved too much of his religious beliefs, and for the first 30 minutes, didn't even focus on Ali. Which brings me to another point, the relationship between Malcom X and Muhammad Ali was poorly established and the viewer felt no emotion and didn't care about the death of Malcom X.With this movie clocking in at 2 hours and 37 minutes, it was about 37 minutes too long, which even at 2 hours is too long for this horrendous film. If there was a bright spot it was most definitley the ending, not because it was filmed good or of that nature, but because it signified the movie was over. One of the biggest dissapointments I have watched. Only Will Smith prevented me from turning it off.4\10 stars",Null,0,1,20 January 2004
