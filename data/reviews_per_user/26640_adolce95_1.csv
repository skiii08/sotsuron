Iron Man 3," Brilliant
","This is the best super hero movie I have ever seen. It was complete in every way, with the humor and plot and characters. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark perfectly, and the plot twist in the middle is great. I had no complaints about this movie. This film is the best movie, by far of the Iron Man series, and of every series of super hero movies. It has the action and sci-fi content, the dramatic content, as well as the humor to almost classify it as a comedy. This movie also proves that Tony Stark does not need the suit to be a successful hero, he can more than handle thing with only his wits and his knack of creating things. This was one of the best films I have ever seen.",10,17,27,3 December 2013
