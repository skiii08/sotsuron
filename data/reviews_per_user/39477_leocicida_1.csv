The Avengers," I love It
","The movie Avengers is a must see film for all viewers. The all-star movie fulfilled the high expectations of the world most powerful superheroes saving the human racing. Within two minutes, the movie quickly picks up after the self-sustaining energy force, that is stolen by a semi god named Loki. As gripping as the story line starts off, the special effects are just as spectacular. The headquarters ship to aircraft sequence was breathtaking enough. The effects were so realistic that it begged the question if such technology is real. Thor's sex appeal is enough to keep the ladies watching with his hammer of steel, lengthy hair and rugged style. Thor's fight with Captain America was certainly unexpected. If anything we expected an all-out war with the many quips that Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man flings around. He brings comic relief to the otherwise tense cast. Dr. Bruce Banner a.k.a Hulk is remaining calm as ever and typically does nothing for a good part of the movie besides fondle some technology and look busy. Every once in a while, Dr.Bruce Banner comes out of his office along with Tony Stark to explain the magnitude of the energy force and the some strategic advice. Later on, he character becomes truly essential to defeating the bigger aliens. Captain America is almost as useless in the beginning because he's not up to date with any of the technology so he just sits around trying to grasp the concept most of the conversations between Mr. Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D, and the rest of the avengers. At one point he blurts out 'I get that! I understand that phrase. I do, I get that one.' Referring to a pun made by, none other than, Mr. Stark. We do however find out that Captain America is arguably the wisest of the team. Somehow he's able to slide in some subtle wisdom like 'we've got to put that (problems) behind us and get this job done' and 'Sometimes there isn't a way out.' Iron Man earns the most improved award in this movie. He goes from a rich self-absorbed hero to a still rich, now deserving the title, hero. Sad to see but other characters didn't really change much during the film, or grow in morals. Sometimes, it's nice to see such super heroes grow into better people. Along with the almost stationary characters, the background didn't really changer either. Most of the action and plot took place of the aircraft. The movie can be dwindled down to two main back drops, the aircraft and the downtown of New York City. Combat in this movie is of epic proportions. You have the entire kick ass fighting styles of a super hero and Special Forces but without any of the excessive blood splatter that can sometimes just demean an entire movie. Crowds should flock to this movie for its stellar use of special effects, heroism, and best of all to see our daring young heroes compete in war.",Null,1,4,13 November 2012
