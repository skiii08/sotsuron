Fight Club," Fight Club
","The film unfolds self-examination and thinking from the perspective of exploring humanity and the era of the current social material desire overflowing with a lack of spirit.

American Beauty," Under the watchful eye of the soul, the world is naked
","The film is full of extremes, and the appearance is completely opposite to the reality. Violence and sex are staged. When everyone takes off their disguise, they seem to be confused, but they are extremely calm and smile.
The state of everyone in the movie is very similar, so chaotic that there is no protagonist, but why should the movie be described from the first perspective?
Lester was the only one who died, his soul was free.
When a person is about to die, the brain will look back on life, and the soul will stay above the flesh. I think this movie is about gazing at the world with the eyes of the soul. Under the gaze of the soul, the world is bare. The movie perspective previously mentioned is actually the soul's eye.
When I first watched the movie, I was thinking that human beings are too keen to pretend to be ill.
After careful thinking, I feel that the director will not just want to bring us this emotional and extremely pessimistic thought. I think the director wanted to tell us that our soul and body should get along well, not bullying, not occupying, let alone abandon each other and hurt each other.",8,0,0,26 May 2020

The ruins of the war are in sharp contrast with the beautiful environment. Hope the world will always be peaceful! War has brought us too much decline, cherish everything in front of us, peace is the greatest victory of this era!",8,1,2,15 May 2020
Joker," We're Jokers
","Our ever-increasing greed, occupancy and fame and fortune have led to a harsh living environment. Not an individual event. This is not God's punishment but our death. Human nature is indeed sinful, and things are not complicated. As a person, his basic needs are not much, and his source of happiness is not much. But materialistic lies engulf most people.
I have no intention of slamming the clown's victimized heart, murder, and the rich's meekness for being rich and benevolent. All of them are victims. They live in the false and unknowing hypocrisy of unconsciousness.

The Shawshank Redemption," Fate
","Man does not have to accept the arrangement of destiny, nor does he have to resist the arrangement of destiny, but when the destiny occurs, see his own character clearly and understand why he is at the threshold of destiny. Only when you understand yourself can you make the most appropriate choice in front of fate.
In fact, the end of life, whether good or bad, being a boatman, or being a banker, is nothing but a different model of fate. What really matters is that becoming a boatman or banker is a willing choice.
There is no good saying in life. Everyone has his own unique definition of goodness deep in his heart. He really chooses to conform to his heart and will eventually reach that end point.
It is a pity that most of us use other people's definition of goodness to set our own lives. Those moments that accompany our inner conflicts remind us of the current choices are problematic. While we resist to face this conflict, we try to rationalize the inner conflict in various ways while using the willpower The way to force yourself to continue to move forward with conflict.

While making the audience shudder, the audience was deeply impressed by the brutal and violent visual stimulation and the exciting tension. . After reading it, the first feeling was bloody and scared. After all, I found that everyone seemed to be a silent lamb, and everyone had to face a dilemma. If you don't run, you must stop; if you don't make a sound, you need to be silent. Externality and internality can never be unified, often divided and hostile.",8,0,0,17 May 2020
