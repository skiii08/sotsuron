Deja Vu," Forgettable
","Deja Vu is one of those movies that couldn't have been made even ten years ago. Whether this is good or bad depends on your point of view. This particular film depends entirely on computer graphics and the modern viewer's fascination with video games and pop physics. If you believe the right joystick in the right hands can make virtually anything happen, then you'll love this movie. If you are willing to suspend your disbelief in the miraculous technological gimmickry and just blindly go where the writers' lead, then you may enjoy the fun. Or not.The story is a convoluted mix of science fiction, criminal justice, terrorism, new age humanism and fluff. I sat through the whole thing and groaned at the end. By this measure, the movie was too long. Even accepting the movie's fantastic premise, something just didn't feel right about the kicker at the end. Maybe I got lost in the myriad explanations of the technical wizardry offered by the head computer geek.I watched the DVD version. It was a somewhat pleasant and mindless alternative to an evening of reality shows on TV. By this measure, the movie was just long enough. Although sitting the entire evening with my finger on the volume control wasn't all that pleasant. One moment you turn the volume up in order to understand an especially touching bit of muted dialogue. The next moment you punch it down to avoid having your eardrums blasted back to the stone age by an explosive sound effect. I know the modern geniuses do this on purpose, but do they do it to irritate the viewer or to keep him awake? Oh, well. It's a movie you'll forget the moment the credits roll. I guess I'll give it five stars only because Denzel Washington did his best to make me believe anything's possible.",5,0,1,5 May 2007
Children of Men," No Story. Lots of Frustration.
","Children of Men is action without a story.The world is in a shambles. Britain is the lone surviving society. Immigrant refugees are despised and exterminated Nazi-like by British nationals. Human babies are no longer able to be born. An immigrant becomes pregnant. A British national decides to help her for money.This kaleidoscope of action/events should peak our interest and keep us watching. We should care about what's happening on screen. Especially, when the pregnant immigrant and her baby are being pursued and shot at by virtually every other character in the movie. But unless some of this action is sorted out and explained by plot or characterization rather than vague, background political posters, newspaper headlines and newscaster innuendo, we soon lose interestor become extremely frustrated. But the film rolls on and on explaining nothing!The one-star rating is evidence of my extreme frustration.",1,39,69,12 May 2007
Blood Diamond," A Gem
","Blood Diamond is an excellent movie. See it.Blood Diamond is reminiscent of old Hollywood. Yes, Virginia old-fashioned heroes (and villains) do exist. Good (and bad) can be painted in vivid, living color. Just desserts can be served after the main course.The story is original and captivating. The plot is tight. Characters are fleshed out. Dialogue is fresh and believable. The action flows seamlessly from the characters' motivation. The theme of the movie is noble and honest. The acting is superb all-around. The movie is beautifully filmed. The ending is true to the theme. Even the musical score is outstanding.My only quibble, which accounts for my less-than-perfect rating, is the movie's length. Tighter editing could have helped the movie move along at a faster pace. The G-8 political business at the beginning and end of the film is unnecessary and preachy. The movie's theme is well-enough developed that it doesn't need to be spoon fed. Some of the chase/combat scenes seem interminable and could have been cut short.However, I especially appreciated the moments of sincere dialogue between Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Connelly. The film treats their relationship with perfect subtlety and understatement, which only serves to make their connection somehow more intense.I think DiCaprio's performance deserves to be singled out. He was flawless and believable in the role, again reminiscent of yesteryear actors who might have been pegged for such a role (Robert Mitchum?, Richard Widmark?). Any criticism that DiCaprio lacks the machismo to carry off such a part is unfounded.This film, which I didn't expect I would like, goes a long way to restore my faith in present-day Hollywood's ability to make good movies.",9,0,1,1 June 2007
The Departed," A Dalliance in Nihilism
","Good movies nowadays are few and far between. 'The Departed' is not one of them.I am not a film aficionado. However, I enjoy a good movie. What's a 'good' movie? One that has a point or, at least, an intellectually honest theme, but is, at the same time, entertaining. The plot, characterization and dialogue complement the theme and move the action seamlessly to a dramatic climax. The craft of movie-making (acting, directing, lighting, music, set, etc.) serves the theme and makes a good movie great or mediocre, entertaining or disappointing.The theme of 'The Departed' is pointless nihilism: anything goes. As a result, the movie is bad and unentertaining. There are no admirable characters, only amoral jerks, some of whom happen to labor as laughably angry, incompetent policemen, and others who revel as nauseatingly satisfied, bloodthirsty hoodlums. If there are any despicable characters at all in the world they are the rats who work undercover for either the police or the hoodlums. And, if there is a hero, it is the illegitimate vigilante who is able to do with one bullet what the legitimate authorities cannot do with armies of officers and the latest electronic wizardry.Is the theme of this movie in any way relevant to the real world, or the world as we wish it to be? Is it true to anything? Why do we watch movies like this? Or, worse, why do we pay to see them? The graphic executions and tawdry sex scenes were worse than gratuitous: they were snide and commercial. I paid to see this movie because I didn't do my homework.",1,0,4,1 June 2007
The Last King of Scotland," Bonehead Scot Earns A Trip To The Wood Shed
","The Last King of Scotland is one of the best DVD's I've seen recently. The movie is about a naïve, young, medical school graduate who journeys to Uganda at the time of General Idi Amin Dada's rise to power. The young lad is on a selfish, Peace Corps-like adventure but soon becomes acquainted and associated with Amin as a sort of top adviser. The story follows the young man's slow descent into the horror of Amin's reign.The movie was quite good. I'd watch it again. Shot on location, the film is rich in local color. The story is gripping. Almost from the beginning you're at the edge of your seat waiting for Amin's shoe to drop on the clueless, young child of the 70's, Dr. Nick who, by the way, had to be the dumbest, most politically ignorant kid in his class. He sure didn't attend the same prep school as The History Boys. Although he did select Uganda as his destination by dropping his finger on a spinning globe, you would expect he'd do a bit of research before leaving home.The acting is first class. The sex is gratuitous. So is the violence. (What else is new?) Judging from the deleted scenes, character depth was left on the cutting room floor. Still, Amin is known and portrayed as such a fearful, ruthless and psychotic figure, little else is needed to move the story along briskly.The movie makes the point that political heroes/saviors often turn out to be the worst kind of scoundrels. I would have enjoyed that story much more if the plot had turned around the international political and economic intrigue that enabled Amin's dictatorship rather than Dr. Nick's insatiable, sexual appetite.I'll score the movie eight stars only because the good, Scottish doctor is too much of a spineless bonehead to take seriously or even sympathetically.Enjoy.",8,1,3,24 May 2007
The Queen," Royal Flush
","The Queen. You know this one wasn't half bad, considering that I could care less about the Queen of England or the political intrigue surrounding the death of Princess Dianna. It was my wife's choice. We watched the DVD together.On the other hand, it wasn't half good either. While my wife was in tears, I marveled at the fact that, apparently, Tony Blair does his own dishes.Plot and characterization in this one are more for historical interest than cinematic enjoyment. (I suppose the Queen and Tony Blair's wife must have husbands.) If you're into celebrity, royalty or English pomp and circumstance, you'll enjoy this movie. If you're a husband, you're best advised to simply keep your mouth shut, grin and bear it.",4,1,3,5 May 2007
