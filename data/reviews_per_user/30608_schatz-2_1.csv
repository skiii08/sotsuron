The Blair Witch Project," worth the money
","I'm not a person who's into the whole horror genre thing. Suspense has always been more of my thing. But the ads for TBWP caught my attention. I found the film more intense than just about anything else I have ever seen. I went with a friend, and by the end we were holding each others hands so tight, I thought i was going to lose all feeling. Absolutely one of the most frightening movies of all time!",9,1,1,2 August 1999
