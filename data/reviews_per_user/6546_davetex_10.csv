Scarface," De Palma is an artistic thief, and he's guilty of it here as well, but what the hey, nobody's perfect
","Not that there's anything wrong with being an artistic thief. Good artists borrow, great one's steal, or something like that.To be honest, I'm not a big fan of De Palma. Carrie was good, as were The Untouchables and this one, but I can't think of many other films of his that are really good. All copies of the Black Dahlia should be burned as a public service.But this one works and the funny thing is that it has improved with age.Someone else in this esteemed forum has suggested that this is original De Palma, not snitching from Hitchcock, or Spielberg or whomever. I disagree.If Stanley Kubrick had ever made a gangster flick, it would have looked much like this one, I think. The give away is not so much the way it is shot, but the set ups for each shot. The attention to detail, and the combination of colors, images and contrasts in each scene are totally Kubrick. So also are the moments of building suspense.The entire cast is good, but Pacino is amazing, allowed utterly free reign and running with it. Some of the lines he is required to utter are so over the top, I watch closely to see if he is struggling to keep a straight face, but he pulls it off.Forget all the stuff about this being a statement about the dark side of the American Dream blah blah blah (which begs the question as to what the bright side of the American Dream is, but I digress). Maybe it is, but the important thing is that this is one big fat fun movie.",9,0,1,31 July 2007
The Polar Express," A worthy experiment in animation effects
","I have now watched this film twice and have decided that I like it, although I have some misgivings about the overall message it contains.On a positive note, the animation is cutting edge and the story works, being the correct mix of wonder, magic and ghosts that are part of Christmas. Zemekis borrows freely from various sources to make up his movie, including Dickens,1984 (check out the Elf Monitor scene), harry potter, old bugs bunny cartoons to name but a few, but somehow it seems to work (despite the scene where Santa finally appears and the elves cheer him like Hitler at a Nuremberg rally which I found just wrong). The animation is strange to my eye, the characters looking often like animated dolls, but the sets and other visuals are stupendous.The hot chocolate scene is worth price of admission alone.What I found somewhat troubling about the movie is how the whole Christian basis of Christmas is entirely eradicated (other than preservation of the term Christmas) and it is somehow all about Santa Clause (who, lest we forget, gets his name because he is based upon a catholic saint) and getting presents. Now, I am not particularly religious, but I found that part of the film a little troubling, mostly I think because the film uses all of the Christmas references, glowing candles, Christmas carols and so forth, but the guy who started the whole thing by being born gets carefully airbrushed out.But then, this is not the first Christmas movie to do that, so one cannot be too picky.",7,4,5,30 November 2006
Watchmen," Never really gets airborne
","I've not read the book, but both my sons have and we all went to see the movie recently. My impressions were as follows: The effects are good as are the costumes. Some of the lines they have to say, not so much. On the whole, the film doesn't quite click. Something doesn't quite work.None of the actors were bad but also none were terrific, they were lost in all of the costumes, effects and occasional silly lines.I thought it was way too long. My sons, who read the book, were of the impression that they had tried to film every panel of the graphic novel and that was a mistake.I agreed and found that the plot gets lost in all of the subplots. By the time you get back to some event or another that was relevant to something that happened half an hour or more ago in the film, the urgency was gone and you didn't really get the point.The big naked blue guy character is distracting. I found myself saying 'put some pants on for goodness sake, you're on Mars, after all.'Ultimately, its a superhero movie that takes itself very seriously. I was unable to do the same.Watch something else if you have the option would be my recommendation.",5,7,11,23 March 2009
Apocalypse Now," 'The horror, the horror'- Brando's dietician
","If ever the grasp of a movie exceeded its reach, it was this one.  Which, in fairness to Coppola, is also true of the original novel, Heart of Darkness. Everybody had to read the damn thing in high school or first year english, and no one really understands it.Actually, when you consider the subject matter a bit of ambiguity is called for anyway, in my mind.I love this movie because it has that wonderful flavour of a moment. I remember the first time I saw it in a theatre, and looking back at the amazing cast years later, it is a delight to see so many talented actors either on top of their game (Duvall) or just starting out (fishburne and Ford). Its one of those movies that makes you nostalgic for when it was first issued. And it is one of those movies that if you stumble across it while channel surfing late at night, you can settle in and watch a few minutes of it, or the rest of it, without effort. When I got a DVD, it was at the top of the 'I have to see this on DVD' list.And the amazing lines. Everyone remembers the scene with 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning'.  But what about the two guys at the bridge who turn to Willard from behind their machine gun and say to him in response to a request to see their commanding officer 'I thought you were the commanding officer,'.   What about the line in the original briefing 'We have found kurtzs methods to be.... unsound.'The surfing scene, the arrows and spear scene, the hotel room scene in the beginning, the water skiing scene, the beach party after the fire fight, the shot up fishing boat, Kurtz's compound, the playmates, the bridge, the helicopters and planes in the tree ups the river.  Visually this movie has more stuff than a dozen others and that includes most of the other Viet Nam flicks.Sure, the thing tanks a bit when Brando as Kurtz finally shows up, but its a let down in the novel too.  Nobody could live up to the mystique the story wraps around the character of Kurtz.  I still think George C. Scott or William Holden would have been a better choice. No offence Marlon.Coppola has stuck his name on a bunch of crap over the years, but this one was worthy.Flawed, imperfect but still a great movie.",Null,0,0,13 February 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Not your average Chop Socky Movie
","Okay, I had expectations when I went to see this movie. I was expecting a big budget Bruce Lee type epic crossed with some John Woo effects. I took my oldest kid who is 14 and off we went.I figured, no matter what, Chow Yun Fat was worth the price of admission.Well, I figured wrong. It is not big budget Enter the Dragon, and Jackie Chan would fit into this film about as well as woody allen.It is a gorgeous, slllowww movvingg art film. Did I mention it is slow moving? Really, really slow moving? Well, maybe not that bad, but slow. By the end of the second hour, my son and I were both regretting the big cokes we had drank about an hour before, and it was getting kind of tiresome to read subtitles that did not seem to match the lip movements too well.When we left the theatre, we were feeling less than thrilled with the whole experience. But then, a funny thing happened. I kept thinking about what I had seen, like a half remembered dream.This movie is one of those that sticks in your head and percolates.  You remember the scenes, and unlike the usual 'car chase blowed 'em up real good' crap that is most action movies to be consumed like popcorn, this one had you thinking about the images and the ideas. The flying effects are amazing, and the cinematography is gorgeous. The sets are unbelievable. They make star wars look like cheap plywood 'B' movie stuff.I am definitely going to have another go at it when it comes out on DVD. Next time, I will enjoy it for the art film it really is.Highly recommended.  But have a small coke.",Null,0,0,15 February 2001
The Number 23," This movie is better than everyone says
","Recently, I came home from the video store with this one and '1408'. I told my wife that the night's movie theme was horror movies based on numbers that got lousy reviews when they came out.1408 lived up to my expectations (see my review), but this one was considerably better than I expected.You have to admire really funny guy Jim Carrey for trying so very hard to break out of being endlessly typecast as the really funny guy.Sometimes he is more successful than he is here, but frankly, I think he does a pretty good job of it, given what he has to work with. I suspect that this movie never would have been made without him and that he signed up because the story let him play so many different types of persons. He gets to play Walter, the nice guy, and also Walter, the tortured soul, and most fun of all, Fingerling, the weird goth/film noir detective. Sometimes, the real Jim Carrey, a really funny guy, peeks out from time to time, but on the whole he plays it straight. Trouble is, we keep seeing Jim Carrey, the really funny guy. Whoever thought it was good idea to make him an animal control officer as Walter, forgot about Ace Ventura, and well, the audience probably didn't forget. It sure occurred to me.The animal control officer designation is necessary, I guess for the 'dog' plot device that is used in the film, but I think I would have tanked the dog and used a crow or something and made Jim Carrey an accountant or some such. And anyway, how does an animal control officer get such a really amazing house? But, that's all nitpicking.The plot line is a bizarre mishmash of ideas and is convoluted and contrived, but I thought the direction and in particular the camera work was very good. The lighting in particular, I thought excellent.The cast is well chosen and they all do their jobs competently, but the really interesting thing is watching Jim Carrey, as always, in a Jim Carrey movie. The guy can act, no doubt about it. I find it ironic that he is so good that he can do comedy like literally no one else (which everyone will acknowledge is very difficult to do well and all the junk that comes out under the National Lampoon or Saturday Night Live Alumni brands is proof of that) but he seems to want to be a 'serious' actor. Keep trying Jim, I'll keep watching.",7,1,2,17 November 2007
Coyote Ugly," A really good movie.
","I didn't want to watch this movie but they made me and now I am glad they did, because it was really really good, not stupid at all, like everyone says.  No it was a really super, terrific movie with a good plot and good acting and good directing and it kept me interested through out. I think it deserves a nine out of ten and the only reason I don't give it ten out of ten is because Julia Roberts isn't in it. It was so good that I watched it ten times in a row, and I would have watched it even if they hadn't tied me to the chair. Go out and rent it right away. Better yet, buy a copy. Then you will have it forever. Maybe buy an extra copy for your friends to borrow or in case yours melts or something.Seriously.",Null,0,0,20 February 2001
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," If Yoda is so smart, why can't he form a proper sentence?
","I had heard that this movie was the best of the latter chunk of the Lucas saga, and so decided to sit down and watch it. I retained my 11 year old to advise me on the more complex plot issues, but he got bored about half way through and left and I had to try to figure things out on my own. I think I figured out most of it.As usual the effects with Lucas are great and he thinks up all sorts of weird beasties and funky spaceships that remind me of the hours spent doodling similar things in grade three. And so that part of the movie is a pleasure and about the same level of sophistication.He made me believe that Yoda, who looks like Kermits great great grandfather, was a real puppet. Especially when falling through space. You would have thought he would just look like someone dropped a muppet, and he does, but still, he did it with style. Kermit would have been proud. Too bad he never took grammar in school, or maybe he's dyslexic or the writers are.Also fun is watching various high powered acting talent delivering their comic book lines while using every skill at their disposal not to look embarrassed for being there or bored with standing around in front of the blue screen and waiting eagerly for their scene to get killed off. Samuel Jackson in particular deserves high praise for trying to play it as straight as possible while serving up lines that Adam West would be comfortable with. Jimmy Smits looks stoned half the time, which perhaps he was,at the suggestion of his agent. I hope they got paid handsomely for their work. They deserved it for their efforts.I give full marks to Ewan MacGregor and Hayden Christenson for acting like they really believe the whole thing is legitimate. Bravo lads. That sword fight in the molten lava was totally unbelievable. They were totally cool and neither seemed to be sweating at all at the end of it which was about the only thing in the film that wasn't totally realistic and true to life. Seriously.Tnen of course, there are the various wookies and the other critters and that weird crab thing that is General Grievous, who all manage to be fluent in English (except the wookies- what the heck are they anyway? Bears? Dogs? Walking rugs?- who make only that weird wookie sound yet appearto be technically proficient in operating space ships) You gotta love a movie character whose head looks like a vacuum cleaner or some kind of foot fungus and there were several.I also appreciate the long length of the film which allows for the maximum amount of time watching the characters deal with the huge moral issues that will impact the entire galaxy while things fly about in the background. The little flying things reminded me of flies circling...uh.. whatever. No, I was glad that the film went on and on and on, because I could just sit and bath in the vision of Lucas.The real miracle in this saga apart from the enormous money that it has made for Mr. Lucas is that after all these years of working on these movies he still uses the most basic and static camera positions and old fashioned editing, so that the movie truly is a comic book in every sense of the word. Kudoes to Mr. Lucas for refusing to either surrender to any of the new action movie tricks or to use more interesting and kinetic camera angles or to write a more subtle plot line because he knew they would have conflicted with the overall quality of his product and unfairly raised the expectations of his audience.Truly a labour of love.",10,1,4,26 October 2006
1408," No one should stay in Room 1408!
","I like John Cusack. Once upon a time, I liked Stephen King. I really like Samuel Jackson and Tony Shalub who are very competent character actors. So despite, the fact that there were stacks of copies piled up at the local video store, I decided to give this a try even though the reviews were less than stellar.I am a human being, and therefore fallible and therefore capable of mistakes and I accept that and I accept that I made one when I paid five bucks to watch this thing. Then I made another when I actually watched it. So, to make amends for my error, and like Samuel Jackson, I am here to warn you to stay in another hotel room, do not go into 1408.I haven't read the original story, but the thing bears enough resemblance to the Shining (which in turn was a clone of Richard Matheson's Hell House) that one can now conclude that Mr. King is now 'recycling' himself instead of previous horror writers.John Cusack is perversely fascinating to watch. He looks pudgy and burned out and apathetic throughout and that in turn is truly a horrifying thing to see for a guy who had such early promise. He is truly the haunted man searching for his lost career. I kept calling out to the screen, John, John, run.... run... get out of the movie now....As for the visuals, no horror movie standby goes unused. Its all there, spooky noises, ghosts, the protagonist who does not believe in this stuff, blood and other gruesome stuff flowing inexplicably from nowhere, collapsing walls, weird hotel personnel, the long history of terrible events in the room and on and on and on until you completely lose track and ultimately, interest. If there was a point to it all, it got lost in the special effects.I agree with the film's promotional material, you don't want to visit room 1408.",5,2,4,17 November 2007
The Great Escape," Really, this is just a great caper flick
","It's interesting to read all of the rave reviews this movie gets. 'Best war movie ever' and so forth. I admit its good, and an excellent example of the Hollywood movie making machine in full epic mode, but it's hardly the best war movie ever made. In fact, its not really a war movie at all. Its a jail breakout movie. It is more similar to movies like 'escape from Alcatraz', 'the hot rock' and 'heat' and 'the Italian job' than it is to Saving Private Ryan or full metal jacket.It's also interesting how the focus of the hype for the movie focuses on Steve McQueen, when in fact, if anyone owns this movie, its James Garner. He displays the best range, is on the screen longer than anyone else and his role displays all of the ambiguities that were involved in the POW situation. Plus, cool for cool, he gives Steve a run for his money. McQueen on the other hand spends most of his time throwing a baseball and giving his trademark ambiguous smile and waiting to ride his motorcycle.The rest of cast is a perfect bit of type casting, starting with Bronson, through Coburn and the rest. A pity Mr. Coburn wasn't given more to work with, but then, I've always liked him. Donald Pleasance makes the movie real.As for Richard Attenborough, am I the only one cheering for the Germans against him by the end of the film? Maybe its just because he inflicted the world with the movie 'Gandhi' but I find the man to be a supercilious twit. But again, that's kind of what his role called for.As for the rest of the film, all very competently done, sets are good (although interiors look a little like cardboard at times) and someone could have dressed the Germans better. They all look like they bought off the rack uniforms without getting them altered. The theme music was as unmistakable as the pink panther or a spaghetti western, you can whistle it after the movie ends.Lastly, and this was sort of inadvertent, watching this movie with so many great stars in their youthful prime, one is left with a sense of wistfulness now that most are dead and the remainder are a bunch of old men. Just like the real POWS.",8,2,5,27 July 2005
