The Blair Witch Project," Brilliantly made, but not scary
","I heard from a few people that this was meant to be both believable and scary, but after watching it I found it to be all suspense and no climax. I enjoyed the film and found that the ending was good, but I didn't see anything to get scared about. Plus the characters, although were believable, begun to get annoying.After reading about how it was made, I was greatly impressed and I did feel that it did have a very realistic feel about it. Maybe it was just that I got my hopes up and was expecting to be terrified. Overall a good movie, brilliantly made, but if you want to be scared out of your mind its not for you.. :)",7,1,2,16 September 2009
