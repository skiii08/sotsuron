The Incredible Hulk," Norton good, action boring
","I must admit I never liked the HULK concept. An angry green guy that smashes things... I do like the concept of Bruce Banner. Torn apart by the unstoppable force that gets unleashed as soon as he gets too upset he can't live a normal life. The only choice he has is to become a drifter outside society.In the incredible Hulk Edward Norton makes a great Bruce Banner. Far away from his earlier life we find him working in a third world factory. There's no question he want his old life back, he carries a picture of Liv Tyler with him and on his laptop he has a contact (Mr Blue) that is trying to find a solution to his HULK problem.So far, the story and acting is good. The problem with many superhero-movies is that they need super-villains. We've seen the problem with one villain too much in spiderman 3 and that is what the incredible hulk suffers from as well. The action sequences with the abomination is plain boring and it would be enough to see Bruce Banner gets hunted by the authorities without having to involve something just to get to sell plastic toys to kids...",6,1,4,17 September 2008
The Dark Knight," Can one character make a good movie?
","I didn't think so before I went to the cinema to watch the dark knight. Since the Joker was Heath Ledgers last part before his tragic death I thought it was a hype just to honor him. I was wrong. Back in 1989 and Tim Burtons Batman I thought Jack Nicholson was excellent. I never expected anyone to beat his appearance as the insane criminal Joker. I was wrong. Ledger is outstanding and he alone saves what otherwise should be a pretty standard comic book superhero movie. Sure, the dark knight has one bad guy too much (Twoface) and the action sequences with the batpod is so-so. But when the joker enters the plot everything gets interesting in a twisted sort of way.Bale does once again a good part as the dark knight as well as he did in Batman begins. Cain, Freeman is back as well. Gyllenhaal known from 'the secretary' replaces Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes.Now lets hope they are going to film Frank Millers 'the dark knight returns'!",7,2,9,16 September 2008
