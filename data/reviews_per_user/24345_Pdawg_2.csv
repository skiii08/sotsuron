The Blair Witch Project," A great horror film
","The Blair Witch Project was a great movie.  Even though the actors weren't really actors they displayed a great job of what of what in reality could've happened.  This movie was made so well it seemed as if this really did happen and wasnt just made up by the directors.  I actually thought this film was quite funny in the beginning.  As it went along I started to get more and more creeped out.  The end of the movie was really creepy and very good.  I won't spoil the ending for you, but i suggest you see this movie. ****",10,1,2,3 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas makes another fantastic film!
","I think the Phantom Menace is an excellent film.  Some critics have said its not as good as the others.  Well, I think it is.  I think the critics are saying that because they don't understand the film.  Yes, it may be complicating at some times, but the 4 star movies are always weird and never do well in the box office.  So i say, who cares what the critics think. This film has excellent special effects, and the music was composed very well.  I really enjoyed the pod racing seen, too. Whats more to say, its an excellent film.  ****",10,0,0,28 July 1999
