Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Overall, good entertainment, only a few slight flaws.
","When i heard about the new Star Wars movie coming out, placing in time before the originals, i was ecstatic.  I had always wondered what had gone on before the first ones, only actually listening to one book-on-tape, it was very intriguing to me.  Where did Yoda come from? Who trained Obi-Wan? Why did Anakin turn bad?  These Questions came to my head whenever I thought about it.  I was one of the first in line to get in, it was a legend to me, and folktale, a story which was introduced to me when I was 3.  I saw it right away, and here is what I have to say. I'll cut straight to the point.  Much like the cheesy, corny little poem I wrote in my last line of the first paragraph, some characters are like this. Jar-Jar Binks for example, is funny for about 10 minutes, but his jokey humor falls through as annoying.  Blowing up battle tanks by accident, killing crucial battle droids, this was unnecessary.  It kind of ruins the whole idea of Star Wars.  Don't get me wrong, Star Wars is supposed to be funny, but not in this way.  How can you top Harrison Ford and Chewbacca's Duet? Impossible.  Not in any way with a dumb computer character that you cant even understand.  How about the Viceroy, and his alien race from the Trade Federation.  These characters quickly struck me as annoying.  They mumbled, and had no personality. The rest however I did enjoy. The battle scenes were much more complicated, and graphic.  The Darth Maul fight was so fast and intense, i held in a large coke the whole time, not daring to move a muscle.  George Lucas i think, with the exception of Jar-Jar, and the Viceroy, did a great job, keeping up his reputation with an exciting fast paced movie.  Till Episode II, May the force be with you.  Go I must now.",9,0,0,1 June 1999
