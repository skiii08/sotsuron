Walk the Line," Hello I'm Johnny Cash
","Hello I'm Johnny Cash, the 4 words that send shivers down your spine and tell you that you are in for something special. Walk the line is a film with heart, passion and dedication without so much as a special effect or any CGI. Which is what you don't see nowadays, when I saw Walk the line in the cinema I was in awe, because I was watching some of the best acting I had ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as Johnny Cash, he gets every emotion perfectly and you feel that Johnny is embodying Joaquin throughout this film, especially during the music sequences and Joaquin shows how Johnny's confidence as a performer grows, from the first time he sings Get Rhythm to when he sings in Folsom Prison and knows how to taunt the crowd. Also Reese Witherspoon brings a great performance to the picture and you feel that this women could save a man because of her caring nature and determination.Overall, I think Walk the line is a fantastic film that Johnny would be proud of, you tap your feet when the music plays and you feel for when you see Johnny go down the slippery slope. It has become one of my favourite films that I can watch over and over and over again and not get sick of. I am a starting musician and this film made me want to follow that career path.Thankyou Johnny Cash, Because your mine, I walk the line",10,1,2,29 October 2006
Monty Python's Life of Brian," This film is absolute genius.
","This film is absolute genius, it shows Python at their best. I mean the holy grail was great too and so was the meaning of life, but the life of brian just has so much more to offer. In every scene their is always going to be something great to laugh at, it's fast paced and never slows down. Also every scene in this film can be classed as a classic in my mind, it's amazing, it's so clever, there's the great stoning sequence, then there's the haggling scene, and there's the fantastic what did the Roman's ever do for us, with John Cleese superb comic timing making it so memorable, the way he carries on his point even know he's been beaten is just priceless. But there is also one of the greatest songs in the world on this DVD, Always look on the bright side of life, performed by Eric idle. So if you're feeding off life's grizzle, don't grumble give a whistle, and go and buy this DVD todayyyyyyyyyyyy. Sorry got a bit carried away there.",10,1,5,4 September 2005
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Did I misread the word Fantastic?
","Well I walked into the cinema with an open mind, the first Fantastic Four was not the greatest Superhero film of all time but it was OK. But after watching the opening half hour of the film I was getting restless and bored, the story lacked action that we come to expect from films of this nature. In the overall scheme of things I would say there is about 20 minutes of action at the most in this film, instead it centers around the characters of Mr Fantastic and The Invisible Woman and will they ever get married, quite frankly I was sick and tired of hearing about their wedding.The other problem with this is that the characters are not as developed and rounded as those such as Batman, Spider man and the X-Men. All the four characters are 1 dimensional, Mr Fantastic is just the science man who explains whats happening in the film every 5 minutes, the Invisible Woman is just the eye candy in the film who just changes her clothes in every scene, the Flaming Torch is just an arrogant guy who turns into flames and the Thing is just a rock from Brooklyn. These superheroes lack the back story, lack the personal problems apart from not being able to get married...YAWN! Big deal. In Batman and Spider man the main characters have problems, have their own little wars waging on inside them constantly but with the Fantastic Four everything seems to nice.If there is one good point it would have to be the Silver Surfer, who doesn't really do that much to be honest. He looks cool and he steals the film from the supposed main characters. It would have been better just to make a Silver Surfer movie instead without the Lame 4. Another good part is Stan Lee's cameo.But overall the Fantastic 4 fails to deliver and I just hope that a third film is not on the cards. Give up with the Fantastic 4 and bring on Batman who at one point the fantastic four make fun of. What a joke! Did I hear someone say Fantastic? No, of course not.",1,3,7,6 July 2007
