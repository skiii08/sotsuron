Black Swan," Amazing
","This is truly an incredible movie. There are so many unexpected turns that it constantly keeps you drawn in. The symbolism is so vivid that you literally notice new things after the 5th time watching it. It's the type of thriller that really gets you thinking. Not only is the acting phenomenal, but the effects are breathtaking. Nina is such a well-developed character, that you really get to know throughout the movie. The way she changes from the first to the last seen is astonishing. I cannot stress enough how well done this movie is. Overall, this movie is positively brilliant. I have seen it so many times, and it continues to astound me. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly suggest you get on it. Prepare to be swept away by the elegance. Amazing!",10,1,2,30 March 2013
