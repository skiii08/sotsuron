Ford v Ferrari," Thrilling and Satisfying
","A popular film among audiences and winner of 2 Academy Awards, Ford v Ferrari appears to be a sleeper hit of 2019. It tells the true story of Caroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles (Christian Bale) as they work to get the Ford Motor Company a seemingly impossible victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966. The performances from Damon and Bale are very good, giving us two easily likeable characters. It has these two determined men as they face opposition not only from the demand of making the fastest car in the world, but also from executives from the Ford Motor Company. Despite what the title may think, Ford is made out as a villain of sorts, even more than Ferrari. This isn't as much the story of Ford's upset of Ferrari as much as it is Shelby and Miles' upset of Ferrari.What's best about this film is that it isn't as much a Rocky-esque underdog story as it is a story of passion. Ken Miles was satisfied with the outcome of Le Mans, even though he got cheated out of his rightful place at #1. He got his chance, he knew in his heart that he won, and that's what matters to him. Not only that, but there's the passion of Shelby to make the car to win the race while the corporate people at Ford just want the glory associated with winning. It's as much 'Shelby and Miles v Ford' as it is 'Ford v Ferrari.'The racing sequences are practically perfect, even from the perspective of someone who doesn't watch car racing. They're intense, fun to watch, and show excellent camera work. Most importantly, they capture the thrill of the race, aided through the movie's editing, which is as fast paced as the cars themselves. The film's editing is perfect. It didn't get the Oscar for nothing. Speaking of Oscars, it also won one for Sound Editing, which was also well deserved. The sounds of the race do their part to add to the thrill, a perfect combination of flawless editing.Ford v Ferrari is an excellent film that serves as one of the most satisfying films of recent years. It's a perfect blend of story, character, and fantastic racing sequences. This is a must watch for car buffs, but also a definite recommend for anyone.",9,1,2,3 March 2020
It," Good Stephen King
","It, an adaptation of the Stephen King novel of the same name, will likely go down as one of the defining horror movies of the 2010s. It broke box office records for Fall movies and horror movies, and got a better reception than expected. Plus, it's always noteworthy when a movie causes mass hysteria in the real world. Remember the creepy clown craze when this came out? Anyway, it's a story about a group of kids who have to fight off a demonic entity in the form of a clown that feeds on people and their fears. The film is filled with scares and creepy moments, both in your face jumpscares, and some slow, creepy stuff. The setting is great, between the normalcy of the small town of Derry, Maine, and the creepy locations of the house and the sewers.The film is centered around a group of middle school kids known as the Loser's Club. There's Bill, who's brother Georgie was killed by Pennywise in this film's iconic opening scene, Beverly, who is implied to be sexually abused by her father (while the film is rated R, they still can't exactly show that), Eddie, who has Munchausen by Proxy, Mike, who's parents died in a fire, Stanley, who is under the pressure of his Rabbi father, Ben, who tries to fit in at his new school, and Richie, the big mouth of the group. These characters are the best part about the movie. Each one is developed well enough, and the kids all give good performances. The bond they share and the relationship between them adds to the effect. Oddly enough, there's also a lot of heart to this movie. Most of scenes involving Bill and Georgie are legitimately sad moments that get an emotional response out of the audience. Not only that, it has its funny moments as well. Mostly intentional ones, but a few unintentional as well.Speaking of performances, there is the creepy clown himself, Pennywise, played by Bill Skarsgard. He's fantastic. People will try and compare him to Tim Curry, but it really isn't worth it. They're two completely different interpretations of the character. What makes Pennywise such a great villain is not only the performance, but also how he manifests in the form of other things. The scene near the end where he appears as the painting is a good example. Perhaps better is the fight between him and the Losers, where he's constantly transforming.The film's not perfect, and there is some stuff to nitpick. The scares got predictable after a while. The first few are effective, but most of the later ones are pretty easy to guess. Richie was kind of annoying. But these are minor things. This is still a great horror movie, and one of the best Stephen King adaptations to date. It's also quite an improvement over the 1990 TV adaptation, which is decent in its own right, but not on the same level as this.",8,0,0,24 October 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Best New Star Wars Movie
","The idea of the Star Wars series making movies outside of the main story was questionable at first, given the sheer amount they could explore, and how that would tie in to the main story. If they're all as good as Rogue One, then they're good to go. It follows the story of the Rebellion, and how they came to acquire the Death Star plans, which was the central conflict of the original 1977 Star Wars movie. While it may seem unnecessary to explain that, it does it well enough to keep us interested with a new set of characters, some mysteries explained, and some absolutely fantastic action.There's a whole new set of characters. The main character is Jyn Erso, the daughter of the architect of the Death Star. She's not the type to get involved in the war, or to really care about it, at least at the start of the movie. She's joined by a gang of new characters, the best of which is Chirrut. Chirrut is played by Donnie Yen, popular Chinese movie star. He may or may not be Force sensitive, but he's an excellent fighter and a very wise man. The other major character is Captain Andor, the morally ambiguous leader of the group. However, it's impossible to talk about Rogue One without the ending. Everyone dies. Every single member of that crew dies. Not even K2-SO, the comic relief droid, is safe. While that may put a lot of people off, it was necessary. It avoids the giant plothole of not having them in the Originals.It's very different from most of the Star Wars movies for a host of different reasons. The first, and most notable, is that there is very little usage of the Force. The Force is at the center of the main conflicts in the core Star Wars series, Originals, Prequels, and Sequels alike. Despite the lack of the Force, it still feels like a Star Wars movie. This is, however, owed to the fact that several classic characters and vehicles return. The other notable difference is that it's the most violent movie in the series, bar none. There's no question about it. While the main Star Wars series has all sorts of Science Fiction violence, Rogue One felt more like a straight up war movie set in the Star Wars Galaxy. This is likely due to the presence of familiar weapons and ships.There's no denying that Darth Vader is the best thing about the movie. He's the reason a lot of people saw this movie. For anyone who didn't see the Originals in theaters, this was the chance to see Vader on the big screen. He only has two scenes, one with Krennic, and then 'the scene.' The scene is the ultimate fanboy moment; watching Vader rampage through a hall of Rebel soldiers. The other nostalgic callbacks are welcome. Since it's set just before the Originals begin, you have the TIE Fighters, the X-Wings, the Star Destroyers, and of course, the Death Star. The Death Star was so cool. The best shot in the whole movie was the one where it forms an eclipse over Jedha. The Battle of Scarif is, dare I say, the best space battle in the entire series. The battle on the ground was very well done too. Seeing the Rebels and the Empire clash on the big screen again was a great experience, especially for those of who were born after the Originals came out. The cameos are awesome. It's an excellent addition to the Star Wars canon, and I'd say it'll be the best of the spin-offs for quite a long time.",9,4,6,3 December 2018
Zootopia," Best Disney Movie of the Decade
","It is becoming more and more apparent that Walt Disney Animation Studios no longer holds the monopoly on animation like it did in the past. While they ruled the world of animation for decades, especially in the 90s, they are now constantly competing with Pixar, DreamWorks, Illumination, and others to deliver on animated films. Still, Disney has been quite successful in this decade. Zootopia is quite possibly their best movie of the 2010s, so far. Zootopia, unlike some of the other recent Disney movies, prominently features a core message, which in this case is one regarding discrimination. It's about Judy Hops, a bunny who strives to become the first bunny cop, much to the dismay of her family and many of Zootopia's inhabitants. Eventually she comes across a large conspiracy that affects all of the city. Judy is a good character because she's strong willed and determined, and the audience sees all of her struggles, and shows all of the ups and downs of her plight. She's joined by Nick Wilde, a fox (who in this world are like minorities) who is at different points a friend and enemy of Judy. Either way, he's a fun character to watch because he can handle himself in any situation. The message is conveyed well because it isn't preachy, it isn't blatantly stated, and it's given through well-written and relatable characters.The animation is on par with Disney's reputation as the best animation studio in the world. Everything, from the designs of the animals, to the detail on their fur, to all the different environments of Zootopia, is animated spectacularly. We'd expect no less from Disney. With the environments, the creativity is out in full force. You have the city, which is designed to accommodate each individual animal, you have jungles, tundras, and all these different places where different animals originate from.The mystery aspect is also handled quite well, in that it keeps both kids and adults interested, and it takes Judy and Nick on an adventure through the world of Zootopia. It also takes us to the underworld of Zootopia, showing us some of the crime of the city as well. Without giving away the joke, there's a hilarious scene that parodies The Godfather, which is probably the best scene in the movie.If there's one thing to complain about, it's the ending. Disney really, really, really needs to stop with the twist villain trend. It worked in Frozen, it worked in Coco, but it doesn't work here. There's no reason for Bellwether to turn out to be a villain like that. And since they do it so often, it's not a matter of 'are they going to do it again' it's 'who is it going to turn out to be.' This movie didn't need a villain at all. The prejudices held by some of the people of Zootopia are enough of a villain, it isn't necessary to include an innocent looking sheep who's actually a criminal mastermind drug lord.Zootopia is an excellent addition to Disney's lineup, and even their best movie of the 2010s, delivering strong characters, an incredibly creative world, an interesting storyline, and top-notch animation. This is a must-watch for families and enthusiasts of animation.",9,1,2,24 May 2019
The Irishman," Another Great Scorsese
","With a venerable lineup of crime dramas under his belt, Martin Scorsese produces a film that he has wanted to for a decade; The Irishman. It's based on the book I Heard You Paint Houses, which follows the life of Frank Sheeran, a truck driver who ends up with the South Philadelphia mob, and then eventually with famed teamster Jimmy Hoffa. Robert de Niro, Scorsese's most frequent collaborator, plays the role of Sheeran. Joe Pesci, another frequent face, is in as Russell Bufalino, head of a Pennsylvania based mob family. Al Pacino, famous for his role in The Godfather films, returns to crime dramas and plays the role of Jimmy Hoffa. All three performances are good in their own right, even if they are thrown off by external circumstances.For those who have seen Goodfellas, there's actually quite a bit of overlap in terms of the way the film is structured. Both have the main character serve a double role as narrator, both follow the life of this character over the decades, and they are similarly edited. With Sheeran also the narrator, it feels almost like a documentary, especially as the country changes and the mob and teamsters with it. The film's editing is also very good, considering how much is packed into the staggering runtime. The main difference with Goodfellas is that The Irishman is told from an elderly Sheeran, a mobster whose life is behind him. The ending of the movie is surprisingly emotional, seeing just how much of a toll that life took on him and how everyone around him got hurt.We all know from history that Jimmy Hoffa disappeared, and that his body was never found. That being said, it's still surprising when it happens. While the way it happens in this movie may or may not be how it actually went down, it is very impressive that the movie can take the one thing that we know is going to happen and make it one of its biggest surprises.Another thing that drew people's attention was the de-aging tech used in the movie, which had previously been used in Rogue One and other blockbusters. It doesn't work in this movie. De Niro and Pesci are in their 70s, and Pacino is 80. While CGI can make them look younger again when they are still, no amount of CGI can change the fact that they move like they're 80. Even on a small screen, it's obvious that someone way older than the character is playing them.One thing must be addressed: the runtime. It's 3 hours, 29 minutes. It's over an hour longer than Goodfellas. Given that it is a Netflix production, it can be watched at any time with any pauses you want. Most of the people who watched this movie did it in multiple sessions, which is reasonable given the runtime. However, this movie is best watched in one go. If you have 3 hours and 29 minutes to watch it, do it. It is best watched in one sitting. It is still acceptable in multiple viewings, and there are guides online with timestamps on when to stop. Netflix also has a 23-minute featurette called The Irishman in Conversation, where Scorsese, de Niro, Pesci, and Pacino talk about the movie. It's recommended for fans of the movie, and it is kind of nice to see them just casually talking about the movie.",8,1,1,28 May 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," Different, but in a Good Way
","The first two Thor movies are among the MCU's least popular. While they're still good movies, they don't compare to most of the MCU. Ragnarok, on the other hand, is among Marvel's best thus far. The word Ragnarok, meaning the end of all, refers to the destruction of Asgard and the death of the gods in Norse mythology. Pretty heavy stuff. Ironically, this is one of Marvel's most comedic movies. It's simultaneously one of the darkest in the franchise, and also possibly the funniest. It's a very difficult thing to pull off, but it's done here quite well. The movie also spends most of the time alternating between Sakaar and Asgard, which helps this effect. On Asgard, which has been invaded by Hela while Thor and Loki are on Sakaar, things are very dark and serious, and the film racks up quite the body count. Sakaar, on the other hand, is ruled by an over-the-top Jeff Goldblum who stages gladiator fights and has an array of over-the-top quirks. The contrast is clear. Another one of the movie's strengths was how awesome Hela is. Her backstory, where she conquered the 9 Realms with Odin until Odin sought to build a peaceful Asgard, was an interesting twist. Speaking of Odin, what's not awesome was how easily he died. While I'm not trying to compare this to Norse Mythology, there he was killed by Fenrir, the really big dog. Here, he just dies from some unexplained cause, looking out into the sea, with Thor and Loki by his side. It's peaceful, yes, but not nearly as awesome as what could have been. The Warriors Three, some of the most important characters in the first two, die early on and are never mentioned again. Sif isn't even in it at all. However, the characters that are given more attention are much better. Thor is not as serious as the other Avengers, but he is still clearly determined to save Asgard. Valkyrie is a fan favorite, and she has a good character arc of returning to Asgard after abandoning it years ago. By the way, am I the only one who thinks it's stupid that Thor, God of Thunder, is stopped by a little electric thing? Anyway, Loki continues his infamous side-switching, causing the viewer to question where exactly his loyalty lies throughout the film. The Hulk is in this movie, and the stakes with him seem much higher than they have in his previous appearances. Korg is Marvel's best comic relief, by far. There's a laugh every time he appears on screen. One thing that's noticeably lacking is that Jane Foster and friends aren't in it. And, honestly, good. The romance on Earth was easily the worst thing about the previous Thor movies. There are a few scenes on Earth, including a funny one with Doctor Strange. It is quite different from the other Thor movies, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The post-credits scene, though... really got us ready for what's to come.",8,2,3,27 April 2018
Moana," A Worthy Addition to the Disney Lineup.
","Disney animation has an impressive repertoire of an array of films, but they're perhaps known above all for their princesses. Despite being perhaps Disney Animation's claim to fame, they've definitely slowed down on them in recent years. However, in 2016 there was another addition to the extensive Disney princess lineup, Moana. It's set in the South Pacific, with a Polynesian princess and accompanying aesthetic. Additionally, it's also a musical, another thing that gave Disney great fame and a lot of money, but has largely slowed down this century.As one would expect, Disney does a spectacular job at animating Polynesia and all the environments in this movie. The ocean looks incredible, and the amount of detail put into the water is outstanding, especially because the ocean is almost a character of its own in this movie. The other places, like the islands and any of the mystical places, also look great. Disney is known for having some of the highest quality animation in the world, and it shows here. The songs are also pretty good. The one people know most is You're Welcome, but honestly, most of that is probably from memes. How Far I'll Go is pretty good, and Shiny makes for a good villain song.Moana herself is a likable protagonist, although a bit much in the vein of some other recent characters, notably Merida from Brave. She's strong-willed and determined, which does make the audience want to root for her. Her backstory, in which she's the daughter of the chief who doesn't want her to go out on this quest, but she does so anyway. Maui, played by the Rock himself, is also a good character. The most memorable thing about him is probably his action sequences with his hook. Te Ka, who is silent, is the film's main villain, so it's nice that a Disney movie in the 2010s doesn't have a twist villain.Moana, all in all, is a worthy addition to Disney's extensive lineup. It wasn't quite the phenomenon that Frozen was, but I have a feeling that 2010s kids will remember this the same way Aladdin is remembered by 90s kids. So is there going to be a live-action Moana released in 2043?",8,1,5,16 May 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Good, but very different
","Spider-Man has quite a wild ride on the big screen, hasn't he? Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies are a solid trilogy, but Sony's are rather forgettable. But with two sets of Spider-Man movies behind us, it's hard to not look back, especially on the Raimi trilogy, when thinking about Homecoming as a movie. That's important to bring up because Homecoming drastically differs from the previous Spider-Man films. While that's not necessarily a bad thing, it does mean that something just feels wrong about this movie. Maybe it's because the Daily Bugle's not in in. Maybe it's because Mary Jane isn't in it either. Maybe it's that Spidey's suit has all the different powers and weapons that makes him feel more like Iron Man. But something just feels off about it. It is still a very good movie, and possibly Marvel's funniest to date. Even if he was introduced in Civil War, there's no denying it. Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man. He acts and looks like he's 15, unlike Maguire and Garfield, who were clearly way older than the character they portrayed. Without giving anything away, the climax and ending were absolutely spectacular, both on a visual scale, and the way the character development sorts out. The other characters were good as well. Vulture was one of the best comic book movie villains ever. What's great about him is that you could make the legitimate argument that he's not actually a villain. He's not out to kill Spider-Man or something like that. He's just doing what everyone wants to do - get rich and live an easy life. He doesn't even cause that much damage, making him much more human than other villains. As for the other characters, well... Controversial opinion: Zendaya wasn't funny in this movie, she was annoying. She's a good actress, I know she's a fan favorite, but the whole movie she was trying way too hard to be edgy. It wasn't funny at all. Ned was pretty funny, though. He fills in Harry Osborn's role quite well. Liz wasn't exactly the most memorable character, but she had some good scenes, so she's fine. It really did feel like she was filling in for Mary Jane. You do gotta feel bad for her at the end. Iron Man is in this movie, but he's kind of like a father figure to Spidey here, and it works. All in all, I think I'm personally blinded by nostalgia for the Sam Raimi trilogy to appreciate Homecoming for what it is. I know that the aspect of Spider-Man having become famous through YouTube in this version negates the purpose of the Daily Bugle, but that just leaves a void in the film. It doesn't feel like a Spider-Man movie. And while that's not necessarily a bad thing, it just makes it hard for me to enjoy Homecoming as much as others did. It's a worthy addition to the MCU, and that's what it is. MCU Spider-Man. What we've wanted for so long.Personal aside: my brother saw this movie before I did because I was stuck in the New Jersey Pine Barrens, and he successfully tricked me into thinking that the post-credits scene was super important. I had to go to the bathroom so bad by the end of the movie, but I absolutely had to wait for the post-credits scene. I couldn't miss it. And if you know what it is... yeah. I got fooled big time.",8,3,5,23 February 2018
Suicide Squad," Worst Comic Book Movie Ever?
","This movie is pure garbage. After the disappointment brought on by Batman V Superman, it was quite evident that things were heading in the wrong direction for DC. Here, expectations were set at rock bottom, and even then, it failed to reach them. I can easily say that this is the most boring superhero movie around, at least of those that are part of current canons. After the first third of the movie, which is entirely introducing characters, it consists primarily of the Squad walking. The first part, with the exposition, wasn't that bad. It got dull after a while, but still could've been worse. What's worse is that the story is just plain dumb. Basically, after Superman's 'death' in Batman V Superman, this officer named Amanda Waller (who is quite possible the most hateable character is this whole dang thing) recruits some of the most dangerous criminals in the world (some of which are shown being beaten by Batman and The Flash) to fill in his role. The idea was so heavily criticized, that even the Lego Batman Movie made fun of it. Anyway, this group of baddies needs to fight this sorceress named Enchantress. She was pretty cool for her first 2 minutes, then she got dull really fast. She's also got this brother named Incubus, who is just about the most generic movie villain, ever. He also looks like Volga from Hyrule Warriors. Perhaps the most glaringly wrong thing about this film is Jared Leto's portrayal of the Joker, which I think is a viable contender for worst book-to-screen portrayal of a character, in general. While Heath Ledger did set the bar pretty high, there wasn't enough of him here, and he felt like a mashup of other previous Jokers, with no consistency. It also has all this unnecessary sexualization, of characters both male and female. In some cases, notably Harley Quinn, we can expect that given the source material. But holy crap, I swear Harley's ass gets more screen time than the Joker. Some of the squad's members, namely Katana and Slipknot, are totally useless. All in all, this is easily the worst comic book movie in recent years. No matter how bad it is, we must never forget our deepest loss, brought on by this movie. R.I.P Slipknot. We'll never forget.",2,2,3,25 January 2018
Doctor Strange," A Personal Favorite
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe can easily be divided into two categories - the Sci-Fi/fantasy movies (like Guardians and Thor), and the more earth-based/thrillers (like Iron Man and Captain America). It seems like everyone has one side of it that they prefer. Personally, I'm into the Sci-Fi/fantasy movies, which is one of the main reasons why Doctor Strange is my favorite MCU movie. I know it's not one of the more popular Marvel movies, and my love of it is very personal. I'm fascinated by magic, mysticism, out of body experiences, alternate dimensions, all that good stuff. So it's hard for me to judge this movie in all fairness. It's still a great movie.The movies' strongest aspect is easily, as I said, the fascinating powers and abilities of Doctor Strange and those who use the Mystic Arts. Watching them harness the mystic energy and use it is such a cool thing. The multiverse scene was probably the best moment in terms of visual effects, possibly ever. Some of the coolest moments are the ones that involve bending reality, and the difference between the real world and the Mirror Dimension. The best scenes are the multiverse scene, the astral projection scenes, and the scene with New York in the Mirror Dimension. The fact that this movie didn't win the Oscar for Best Visual Effects is appalling. The environment of Kamar-Taj is also interesting. It has people learning the Mystic Arts, a library of ancient books, and has doors to the three Sanctums in London, New York, and Hong Kong, which defend the world from evil forces. It feels like an Asian Hogwarts, but it's one of those movie places that you wish were real. Dr. Strange himself is very similar to Iron Man, with the whole cocky rich guy attitude, but Benedict Cumberbatch does such a great job at playing him that you still end up liking the character. The most interesting character, however, is the Ancient One. She brings a degree of moral ambiguity to the movie, and the truth about her is a great twist, and one that's very fun to think about. Mordo was an OK character. He wasn't dislikable or anything like that, but he was far from Marvel's best sidekick. Wong is a boss. That's all there is to it. Kaecilius also isn't Marvel's best villain, but his backstory does make it seem like he knows what he's doing may be right, even if he clearly (as the running joke says) didn't read the warnings. Needless to say, the scene with Dormammu was absolutely fantastic. And despite being one of Marvel's darker movies, it still has some very funny moments in it. I know from a storytelling and character perspective, it really isn't the best, but the fascinating environments, ideas, and visuals make it a personal favorite. I've watched it a dozen times, and I'll probably watch it a dozen more.",10,0,1,19 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Pay the Price for Your Lack of Vision
","Following the generally liked Force Awakens and the divisive Last Jedi, Rise of Skywalker comes to end the Star Wars sequel trilogy, and supposedly the 'Skywalker Saga.' JJ Abrams returns as director, so it was expected to play it safe. Rise of Skywalker plays it extremely safe. The best way to describe this movie is that it's a turd with icing and sprinkles on it. It looks nice on the outside but cut it open and there's nothing but crap. Virtually every scene in the movie is ripped straight out of a previous Star Wars movie, Avengers: Endgame, or Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. It even rips off the 'I am Iron Man' scene from Endgame.The main problem with this movie is that it tries to please every part of this fractured fanbase, and it ends up as a jumbled, convoluted mess as a result. It spends the first half of the movie undoing virtually everything Last Jedi set up, for better or for worse. It reveals Rey's parentage as a Palpatine, Snoke's true identity, completely changes Luke on every level, and makes it that the lightspeed ram is a one-in-a-million chance of working. If you like Last Jedi, you won't like that it got rid of everything it set up. If you don't like it, it feels like too little, too late, especially in the scene with Luke. That being said; it feels like two movies stuffed into one: JJ's Last Jedi the do-over, and Episode 9. It appeals to the nostalgia crowd and general audiences by bringing back Lando and being filled with references to the originals and big action scenes. It goes for the Prequel fans by getting Hayden Christiansen and Ewan McGregor back. It even tries to please the Reylos, the worst of the fanbase. The scene at the end when Rey and Ben Solo make out is possibly the most cringeworthy cinematic moment of 2019.Since it feels like two movies stuffed into one, the entire first half feels extremely rushed. A lot of the stuff like Hux's betrayal, Finn being force sensitive, and Leia's past with the Jedi all felt like things that would've been set up in Abram's Last Jedi and could have been good. Some stuff is just plain dumb. The fake out death with Chewie was inexcusable. They don't even pretend he's dead for a minute. At least Batman v Superman had the courtesy to keep Superman dead for a good 20 minutes. What did Finn want to tell Rey? Rey's force powers come out of nowhere, like she's Neo from The Matrix. If force healing works like that, then Obi-Wan should've saved Qui-Gon, Anakin should've saved Padme, so on and so forth. It even contradicts the other sequels. If Rey is a Palpatine, why did the Skywalker saber call out to her? Speaking of, where did Maz get the saber, anyway? If Snoke was the Emperor, why did he want Rey dead in Last Jedi? There are too many loose ends and plot holes to count.The biggest, most fatal flaw of this movie is the Emperor. By the sole nature of his survival, the sacrifice of Anakin Skywalker has been rendered entirely meaningless. But hey, no one's ever really gone, so maybe he'll be back in Episode X. This trilogy retroactively ruined the originals and even the prequels by resetting the conflict to 'empire vs rebels.' The victory at the end of Return of the Jedi was short lived, and Luke, Leia, and Han became a suicidal hobo, a failed politician, and a deadbeat dad. This is a problem with all three sequels, but Rise of Skywalker drives it home. The entire move of bringing back the Emperor reeks of desperation, as we know Kylo is an insufficient villain on his own.Hot take: The absolute worst scene in this movie is the ending on Tatooine. It's that one final gut punch that completes the trilogy's ruining of the Originals. The image of Luke standing looking at the two suns in A New Hope signifies his desire to get away from the planet, and a desire for adventure. Bringing his lightsaber there completely contradicts that. Leia's only connection to that place is that she was briefly enslaved there by Jabba. And Anakin's lightsaber is buried in the sand, on the one planet he would never go to. That's like if Harry Potter died and they left his wand under the stairs at the Dursley's house.
Additionally, all the Skywalkers are dead, their lightsabers are buried in a shallow grave, and a Palpatine has taken their name and legacy as her own. Rey calling herself a Skywalker is dumb. She should've said that she's just 'Rey.' Even calling herself Organa would make more sense.While there is a lot to hate about it, there is some good stuff. BB-8 is adorable. They didn't ruin Lando, which is a pleasant surprise. The visual effects are spectacular. The ships, planets, battles, it all looks great. All of the new planets look great as well. The lightsaber duels between Rey and Kylo, despite feeling like they have zero stakes, are good battles that are reminiscent of the great duels of the Prequels. Adam Driver is one of the best actors out there right now, and he's fantastic. The scenes of Kylo being a villain at the beginning are cool. Kylo with his helmet on still looks awesome. The relationship between Rey and Leia is as good as it can be after Carrie Fisher's passing. That being said, her death scene gets a pass. The scene with Han was excellent, because it parallels something from this trilogy rather than take it from another. And for the last time, John Williams knocks it out of the park with another stellar soundtrack.The whole sequel trilogy is just one massive disappointment. Looking back at how hyped Force Awakens was and seeing this as the end result is just sad. Everything was there: the original cast returning, a fantastic new cast of actors, incredible visual effects, and a whole new opportunity to tell a new story, and they blew it. The problem is that there was no plan. You can see fractured pieces of Abram's whole trilogy here, but Last Jedi completely threw a wrench in it, at the expense of the rest of the trilogy. Did Last Jedi ruin Star Wars? Maybe. LucasFilm should not have let Force Awakens come out without a solid plan for the next two movies. That was the mistake. This is trilogy is one of the biggest missed opportunities in the history of cinema.",4,16,27,30 December 2019
Justice League," The Wait is Over
","After years of anticipation, DC's answer to The Avengers has arrived. It's been a rough road for DC, with all but one of the movies being either panned by critics, or receiving mixed reviews. After a complicated production process, the final product is quite the mixed bag. First, the good. The league works well together, and they all develop quite well. Batman and Aquaman learn to work in a group, Wonder Woman is still the strong leader she was, and the Flash is a good comic relief. That chemistry between the group is vital, as the movie could not possibly be good in the slightest without it. And, to the movie's credit, they handle this quite well. The Flash was surprising, and the movie managed to give him a backstory and character development. Aquaman looked and fought cool, but wasn't as interesting a character as he could have been. Batman was much better in this movie than he was in BvS, and they at least tried to redeem him from his portrayal in BvS. If you think he's going to be as good as he was in the Nolan trilogy, don't. Jeremy Irons is also a great Alfred. Wonder Woman may not be as good as she was in her solo movie, but the way she and the Amazons connect to the overall story is very interesting. And, the bad. Steppenwolf was one lame villain. He's remarkably generic, seeking the Mother Boxes to destroy the world. And the fight scenes with him, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman appear to be recycled. His lack of clear motivation is also a problem. Yes, there is apparently a deleted scene with Darkseid in it, but that really should have been in it to begin with. Even if it's exactly like the Thanos scene in The Avengers, it would have made the movie as a whole better than if they dropped it. Cyborg is all edgy and brooding. While that is understandable, given his situation, it just feels like the same crap we saw in the previous DCEU movies. Still, his presence here also means we'll probably never see a proper Teen Titans movie. Superman's return, even ignoring its predictability, was extremely cringeworthy. Also, it teases Green Lantern, but he doesn't appear outside of flashbacks. That's not cool. Given the internal issues there were at DC, you can pick this movie apart and see 'the Zack Snyder parts' and 'the Joss Whedon parts.' It's quite evident who would have done it better. The future of the DCEU has been questioned lately, as Justice League didn't do nearly as expected at the box office. DC absolutely needs to turn things around in their next few films if they want this franchise to be successful.",6,0,1,25 January 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Best Spider-Man Movie.
","Sony Pictures Animation has had its ups and downs. It had critical and financial success with Hotel Transylvania but stooped as low as the Emoji Movie in 2017. However, they bounced back the following year with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which is undoubtedly their best movie, and one of the best animated movies of the decade. While Sony has made 5 Spider-Man movies since 2002 (not counting the Venom spin-off), this is the first one to not focus on Peter Parker, but rather on Miles Morales. Miles is hesitant to take on the superhero life due to his school life and his cop father's disapproval of Spider-Man in general but is encouraged after witnessing the death of Peter Parker. While that sounds like a major spoiler, it happens 20 minutes into the movie. He spends the movie learning what it means to be Spider-Man, and how much harder it is than it seems. Miles' arc is handled very well, and he develops well from not wanting to have his powers at all to embracing his new role as Spider-Man.There are a whole host of Spider-People, as one may infer. There's Miles Morales, Peter B. Parker, Gwen Stacy (Spider-Woman), Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham. Peter B. Parker is the middle-aged, washed up Spider-Man, who serves as a mentor for Miles. Gwen Stacy appears as Spider-Woman, who meets Miles early on and is the first to join him and Peter. Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham are mostly comic relief, but they're great at that. There are a whole host of villains, but they mostly aren't that notable. The main villain is Kingpin, whose motives aren't interesting. It's the same thing as Kaecilius from Doctor Strange in 2016. Prowler is actually a very interesting character, and the twist involving him was done very well. Doc Ock (who in this universe is Olivia Octavius) was a fine side-villain. The others (Green Goblin, Tombstone, Scorpion) don't really do much, but they awesome to watch, given the animation. If there's one thing to complain about with the characters, it's that Spider-Man 2099 doesn't have a role in the main film. But the existing cast of Spider-People are great characters, and it's great to get a proper Miles Morales movie.The animation is absolutely spectacular. This is the closest thing we've ever gotten to a comic book movie in its truest form, meaning that the animation looks like it came right off the pages of a comic. There is nothing like this. From the character designs, to the beautiful flow of animation (especially in the fight scenes, which are mind-blowing), and above all, the text and onomatopoeias that appear on screen. It's one of those movies that's worth seeing in 3D. There is definitely a part of the animation that shows its setting. The soundtrack, which features a lot of rap music throughout fits in well with the visuals. Another great thing about this is how Noir, Peni, and Spider-Ham fit in, despite being done in their own distinctive style of animation. With Peni, for instance, she's an anime character, and the way she's animated follows a distinct anime style, but she never feels out of place. Same goes for Spider-Ham being like a Looney Tunes character. The movie is also well written, and has some excellent moments of humor, but knows when to take itself seriously. When it's funny, it's really funny.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is without a doubt the best Spider-Man movie ever made. As much as I have nostalgia for the Raimi trilogy, I must admit it's been bested. In addition, Spider-Verse is the best superhero of 2018, and one of the best superhero movies of all time. This is an absolute must watch for any fans of Spider-Man, Marvel, or comics in general. It's also worth noting that the movie ends with a touching tribute to Stan Lee, as this is the first Marvel movie since his passing. It's great to see him and Steve Ditko honored at the end.",10,3,6,9 January 2019
Captain America: Civil War," One of Marvel's Best
","While Marvel and DC are perpetual rivals, never before did they really go head to head with similar movies before the Spring of 2016. After the massive disappointment of Batman V Superman, Marvel gave it a shot with their own version, also an adaptation of one of the most popular comic stories of all time. I bring up DC because it's hard to think about Civil War without thinking of Batman V Superman because of how similar they are, and how close their release dates were. And it's quite clear that part of what made Civil War great was that it succeeded where Batman V Superman failed. This review is not just hating on DC, but it really is important. Right when this movie came out, the disappointment from BvS was still fresh on our minds. But enough about BvS, on to Civil War.Marvel has two types of movies, the mystical, cosmic ones and the earth-based ones. This is clearly the latter. It feels more like Winter Soldier than any other Marvel movie, and not just because it's a Captain America movie. There's a lot of talk about the politics within the MCU's world, which is vital to the plot. The Avengers are torn as to whether they should be put in check or not. For those who may not be interested in fictional politics, this will be rather boring. It's kind of like the politics in the Star Wars Prequels, only with way better writing. The Sokovia Accords are something interesting to thing about though. What if this was your world? Would you want them kept in their place? The characters in this movie is the most important aspect. You have the clear division between Cap and Iron Man, where the tension they built over the previous few movies destroys their friendship. At the end of the movie when they're fighting each other, it is actually sad. You saw them build a relationship over the past few movies, and now look at them. Of course, this movie's show stealer was Black Panther. Wow. Everyone knew he would be a fun character to watch, but he was much better than anticipated. The way his character develops makes for a very great sub-plot, which this movie definitely needs. Zemo is one of Marvel's best villains. He has no powers, no super-suit, no magic weapon, none of that. All he has is an idea and some Soviet secrets, and you could very well argue that he wins in the end. There's an interesting relationship between Scarlet Witch and Vision, where she takes Cap's side to and Vision takes Tony's, seeming more like a robot but yet with a bit of humanity in him. Most of the rest of the Avengers are just there for comic relief, like Ant-Man and Spider-Man. That's welcome though. Most of this movie takes itself quite seriously, and the humor helps keep the mood up. The action scenes are fantastic. The airport battle is the best MCU action scene (haven't seen Infinity War yet), and it's not even close. It goes on for 15 minutes, and it's fun to watch, climactic, and has some great lines thrown in. The final battle was epic, emotional, and a great end to a great movie. If there is one thing to complain about, the movie's a tad bit long. It's just over 2 and a half hours. It's still a great movie, and one of my favorite MCU films to date.

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Solid Spin Off
","Fantastic Beasts is a spinoff of Harry Potter, in a universe now known as the Wizarding World. The Harry Potter series has a huge amount of content beside the story of the title character and his friends, namely, the fascinating and developed world it's set it. With a whole world of wizards that has existed within our own, there's a whole host of different options to explore this world. It begins with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the story of Newt Scamander, a British wizard who comes to America in search of a Thunderbird in Arizona but is stuck in New York after his beasts are let loose in the city. It follows him on his misadventures as he finds his loose creatures, which leads into some much bigger problems.What's interesting about this movie is that we see how the Wizarding World works aside from life at Hogwarts and in the Ministry of Magic. By having it set in America, neither of those things have a strong presence in the movie, although they are, along with Dumbledore, name dropped in the movie. Here we have MAGUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America) serving in the place of the Ministry of Magic. It focuses on the grown-up Wizarding World, as opposed to seeing the school of magic. Because of that, it still feels like the world of Harry Potter, albeit from a much different angle. The setting of New York City in the 1920s was done very well, from the excellent costume design to the look and feel of the city and its buildings. Additionally, you have the MAGUSA and some other magical places that have the same magic as the Ministry of Magic and Diagon Alley, but with a much different aesthetic. This movie succeeds because it's not a Harry Potter movie, it's a movie set in the Wizarding World. The beasts are, well, fantastic. One of the movie's biggest strengths is that the creatures of this world are spectacular beings, as one would indicate given the title. They give off that sense of wonder and mystery that the Wizarding World has succeeded in.The characters, on the other hand, aren't as interesting as they were before. Newt is played pretty well by Eddie Redmayne, but his character isn't particularly interesting. What he does is more interesting than he himself. This is, however, movie number one in the series, so give it time. Tina is in the same boat, but the audience can relate to her and her struggles. Jacob is a comic relief, and a pretty good one at that. The jokes about him being a muggle (or no-maj, apparently) entering the wizarding world is relatable, because that's how someone would act if they stumbled into this world. Speaking of, there's the whole ordeal with the Second Salem people. The whole anti-wizard part was interesting to think about from the idea of having this be what would happen if there really was an underground world of magic users. Credence was pretty cool, although that treads into spoiler territory. The ending was kind of dumb, though.Fantastic Beasts is a solid spin-off. It also gets credit because in an age where many sequels and prequels, like Force Awakens and Jurassic World, are essentially carbon copies of the originals. This could easily have been about little Newt going off to Hogwarts like in Sorcerer's Stone. It explores the world more thoroughly, which is its best aspect. It really isn't as good as most of the main Harry Potter movies, but it's a solid movie in its own right. But as the first movie in the series, it did what it had to. It gave us a good time, and left us interested in what's to come.",8,0,1,8 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," The End of a Great Journey
","Avengers: Endgame had quite a few tasks to pull off. It had to be the culmination of 21 MCU movies, it had to finish up several character arcs, it needed to deliver on what Infinity War set up, and it still had to be a good movie. It succeeded in these regards. Endgame is a thrill ride, delivering a fast-paced story, and an extremely emotional finale to one of the most ambitious franchises in movie history. Oh, and it also had to make a ton of money. Mission accomplished. Anyway, it's impossible to talk about Endgame without the spoilers, so this is a spoiler-filled review.The thing with Endgame is that it's not a movie that stands on its own. In order to appreciate Endgame to its fullest, you needed be there at least for most of the time. This is a movie primarily for fans. But it's not like it's off-limits to non-fans. It's possible to appreciate this movie as a casual fan who's only seen a few MCU movies, but it won't have the same impact as on someone who's been here every step of the way.After Thanos destroys the Infinity Stones and is beheaded by Thor, the Avengers must go back in time to retrieve the stones to bring them to the present. The time travel aspect is rather confusing, but then again, time travel across the board is confusing. The idea is that you can't change the present or future, you can only change the past. It's quite something. As far as I know, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the only movie to have time travel that makes sense. With the time travel, we get a trip down memory lane, as we see several events from the MCU unfold again, although from different angles. We get the Avengers arresting Loki, Star-Lord looking for the Power Stone, and the elevator scene from Winter Soldier recreated, although with their own twists. We also see some old friends, like the Ancient One and Frigga. All of this leads to one giant final conclusion, a grand, epic-scale battle between Thanos and his army and the completely assembled Avengers. The final battle is beyond epic and is undoubtedly the best action scene in any superhero movie, ever. This is where the epic moments happen; Cap lifts Mjolnir and says 'Avengers, assemble,' much to the joy of audiences everywhere. Some may complain that it's fanservice, but it's not. It's the natural progression of the story that they've been telling since 2012. They teased Cap with Mjolnir in Age of Ultron, and the moment was worth the wait. And with the constant addition of new heroes, having them come together for the final battle was the optimal way to cap off 21 movies.As far as the spoilers go, there are several. The big one, of course, is the death of Tony Stark. He dies using the stones to take down Thanos. Having watched this character develop since 2008, going from a cocky billionaire to the guy who'll do anything for his family and planet, it was sad to see him go, but at least he died heroically. And in this movie, Tony's arc is interesting because he found happiness, even after the snap. By coming back to the battle, he gives up everything he gained in those 5 years and makes his sacrifice at the end all the more selfless. Plus, everyone thought Cap was going to be the one to die. Speaking of Cap, there's what happened to him. He stays in the past to live with Peggy Carter. Given everything Cap went through over the years, it was a well-deserved victory, and a happy way to end the movie. It's a very bittersweet ending, kind of like Lord of the Rings. On one hand, Thanos is defeated, Cap got to live a happy life, but on the other, Tony Stark is dead and this grand story we've been following for so long is over. It's very emotional, especially for those of us who have been here for years. One spoiler that's kind of odd was Black Widow dying. On one hand, someone had to die at Vormir, as they can't not get the Soul Stone. On the other hand, it felt forced. At least we see how upset Hawkeye and the other Avengers are, so they at least recognize her sacrifice. And, of course, she did sacrifice herself to save the universe, which is, obviously, heroic. But since the movie moves at a rapid pace, it does feel rather rushed.Another aspect of this movie is how it finishes a 22-movie arc, that started way back in 2008. With that in mind, it's the end of an era, but it doesn't jump right in to the next. People were speculating about how things would be after Endgame, but we hardly know. People said Captain Marvel would be leading the Avengers. We don't know. It respects the old characters and doesn't shove them aside for the sake of the new ones. Heck, you're probably fine watching Endgame if you haven't seen Captain Marvel yet. That's not to say it ignores the new characters. The Captain Marvel vs Thanos fight is pretty cool. That leads to another aspect: no one in this movie feels useless. In Civil War, for instance, they could have reached that outcome without Spidey or Ant-Man. Here, everyone plays a part, and every snap survivor did something that led to the conclusion.With that in mind, this movie marks the beginning of a new phase in the MCU, and a new chapter for our heroes. Of course, Iron Man died, Black Widow died, and Cap is old now, as established, but Thor's arc is interesting. He does fall on hard times, but he does come back. Because he's Thor. He rises above his giving up phase and rediscovers himself. Oh, but shame on them for the Fortnite joke. That was disgraceful. Having Thor join the Guardians of the Galaxy was an interesting twist, but I'm not sure where that'll end up. I also have no idea what'll happen with Valkyrie and the Asgardians in Norway. But at least it leaves us interested. It doesn't jump right in to Phase 4. The other character with a shift is Thanos. There are two Thanos's. The one that dies 20 minutes into the movie, and 2014 Thanos. He shifts from balancing the universe to starting the universe over, which isn't as interesting as before, but it definitely raises the stakes. Nebula also has quite the interesting arc. While she doesn't undo the snap in this version, having both versions of her, one seeking Thanos' approval and the other to kill him, is an interesting contrast.Despite the impressive runtime, it doesn't feel that long. Heck, this movie is longer than Fellowship of the Ring, but doesn't feel any longer than Infinity War. This is, of course, due to how fast the movie moves, juggling the post-snap world, all 3 time travel quests, Thanos, and everything else. Most impressively, it's never boring. It's a bit of a slow start, but when it picks up, it really picks up. It starts showing where everyone is post-snap, which it couldn't not have. It doesn't dig too much in, but we see Cap leading group-therapy, an abandoned MLB stadium, and a memorial to the snap victims, which was a neat touch as that would undoubtedly get built like that if it were to happen in real life.Avengers: Endgame is a thrilling, epic, emotional conclusion to the Infinity Saga. It's been fun to follow the story of the Infinity Stones for all these years, and it is sad to see this story end. But, as the tagline says, part of the journey is the end.",9,1,4,6 May 2019
Toy Story 4," Another Pixar Masterpiece
","For those of us who grew up in the late 90's and early 00's, the Toy Story movies are popular favorites among our demographic. For everyone, though, they've gained a reputation as some of the best animated films of all time and having an impact on children and adults alike. 9 years after their previous adventure, Woody and the gang return to the big screen once again. This time, they go on a road trip with Bonnie and her friend Forky, a living spork that she made while lonely in school.The way the characters develop in this movie is very well done. Woody is no longer the favorite toy and has effectively been cast in the wayside. Despite that, he still feels an obligation to care for Bonnie and do everything for her. In some ways, it's a movie about getting old and how hard it is to move on. Instead of caring for the kid as he always has, he now has to teach Forky how much toys mean to children and the power that that holds. It's a surprisingly poignant movie. Meanwhile we have Bo Peep, who's been a free toy for years, showing Woody the benefits of living without a kid.We are introduced to some new friends in this movie. The most important of the pack is Gabby Gabby, who has always wanted to be there for a kid and sees Woody as the means by which she will achieve that. She's a good character because even though she's a villain for most of the film, we still back her completely by the end. There's also Duke Kaboom, played by Keanu Reeves. He's a comic character, and a good one at that. Ducky and Bunny are also like that. It's ironic that Jordan Peele is in this movie given the content of the movies he makes. Unfortunately, with all these new characters many of the familiar ones like Buzz and Jesse are effectively sidelined. Hamm, Rex, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, and Slinky are barely present. Are the Little Green Men in it at all?As someone who adored the first two films when I was around Bonnie's age, I think the ending had a harder impact on me and people of my age than others. Having Woody, Buzz and the gang return was like getting a visit from an old friend you haven't seen in years. With that last scene, with Woody and Buzz realizing they're going down separate paths, was heartbreaking, yet relatable. We've all had those friends, especially childhood friends, who we parted with. We grew up and we parted. In a similar way, our animated friends grew up and parted just like we did. That final 'to infinity and beyond' definitely got the tears rolling, in me and I'd imagine in many audiences.With such a conclusive ending it begs the question: will they make a Toy Story 5? Probably. It would have to focus on one of the two sets of characters now, which could work. While it may seem unnecessary to us now, bear in mind that many people deemed this one unnecessary before it came out. Pixar clearly understands how to run this franchise.",9,0,1,4 March 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," Epic, exciting, and Loaded
","Infinity War was just about as hyped as a movie can get. It had the most viewed online trailer ever, was #3 all time in pre-sales, and was first teased back in 2012 with The Avengers, and most of the MCU movies since then have all been building up to this. Ever since the Infinity Stones were first introduced in the first Thor movie, people have believed that we would see Thanos' quest to collect the all on the big screen. Perhaps most impressive is that it had the biggest opening weekend ever, beating Star Wars: The Force Awakens in the U.S. with $257,000,000, and beating Fate of the Furious globally with $640,000,000.Now, it's impossible to talk about this movie without spoilers, so be warned. 
Given the sheer number of characters and plotlines in this movie, there's quite a bit to take in. It alternates between sets of characters such as Team Cap+Vision, the Thor/Rocket/Groot combo, the Guardians/Iron Man/Strange/Spidey combo, and, of course, Thanos himself. It's definitely true that there isn't enough screen time to go around, which for casual viewers, may be a problem. However, for fans of the MCU, it's fine. It doesn't introduce any new major heroes, so most of the character development already happened in the previous films in the franchise. It also has some good humor and several memorable lines (Get lost, Squidward!) There is some development to be had. Thor does deal with Loki's death and the aftermath of Ragnarok. There are new things happening with the Guardians. However, some characters, notably Captain America, Black Panther, and Bucky don't get enough screen time.If there was one thing this movie absolutely needed to get right, it was that Thanos had to be a great villain. And he was. On the outside, he was everything he needed to be; threatening, serious, cruel, intimidating, and still really believes that what he does is right. But yet on the inside, he does have some heart. Right after he kills Gamora, it really does seem like he's really heartbroken by it. Part of why the movie works is because Thanos is the central character. He gets the most screen time. It's called 'Avengers: Infinity War,' but the Avengers aren't the central focus. This is really Thanos' story. The Black Order isn't really the best set of villains. But they are side villains, so it's fine that they don't get as much screen time. Ebony Maw was pretty cool. Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glave felt like glorified minions. Cull Obsidian was lame.Another part of why this movie works is because the stakes feel real. It subverts the tropes of heroes always winning, killing Loki and Heimdall in the first 10 minutes. Not only are the stakes there, but the situations where characters have to kill each other to prevent Thanos from getting a stone have a great amount of tension to them. (Star-Lord and Gamora, Doctor Strange and Iron Man, Vision and Scarlet Witch) You know they're not afraid to kill off their heroes. Whenever there's an action scene, there's the uncertainty angle. You don't know who's going to die, and it could very well be anyone. The action scenes were absolutely spectacular. There are several of them, and they last for quite a while. The New York fight, which is Doctor Strange and Wong vs Ebony Maw and Iron Man and Spider-Man vs Cull Obsidian, was the first real fight, and a great, exciting action scene. The Battle of Wakanda wasn't as cool as we hoped, given how much it showed up in the trailers. Still, it was very fun to watch, very extensive, and has the same high stakes. Heck, it even delivers somewhat of a sword fight, between Okoye, Black Widow, and Proxima Midnight. Coming off Black Panther, though, it feels kind of rehashed, given that we saw this three months ago. The battle on Titan was probably the best. We saw a new Iron Man suit, new Doctor Strange powers, some Spider-Man one liners, and even Mantis gets in on the fun. And, of course, there's the part where Iron Man gets impaled. He lives, but it's shocking nonetheless.Then, of course, there's the elephant in the room - the ending. Holy crap. The shock factor was definitely there. I knew going in that there was a shocking ending. I thought it was either the Snap, or that Iron Man dies. The snap was absolutely devastating, taking out by my count, 6 Avengers, 4 Guardians, and others like Nick Fury and Maria Hill. I'd say the most shocking death was Black Panther. I thought he was untouchable given the popularity. But then again, by the time that came out, this movie was probably in post-production, so what can you do? Spidey's was really painful to watch. Doctor Strange hit hard personally. But it just felt cheap. Those of us who know the comics know that the snap got undone. You know they're coming back. There's no way in hell they'd kill off Spidey or Black Panther for real. But there's no other way to end it. Thanos was unbeatable with 5 stones, you can't have the whole movie be about #6. Plus, everyone who doesn't know the comics (which is the vast majority of the MCU audience) didn't expect it. The biggest spoiler they expected was that either Cap or Iron Man was going to die. But with the resurrections, it feels like anyone who died could come back. Except Heimdall. He's dead. Loki has 'died' before. Gamora is in the Soul Stone. Vision could be rebuilt. But how else could this end? Like Doctor Strange said, this is the only way.Infinity War is quite the film. It's a lot to take in, but it's a very exciting, well paced film that delivers on most of the hype it's been building up to. Fans of the MCU will definitely enjoy it more than casual moviegoers, and some may find the ending leaves a bad taste. However, it's clearly a Part 1, and it will be interesting to see how it unfolds in Part 2.",9,3,11,13 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Portrait of an Era
","Quentin Tarantino is one of those few people who has managed to create a style of film so unique that his work is easily distinguished from other's. He claims that he will make 10 feature films in his life, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is #9 (he counts Kill Bill as one). What separates OUATIH from the others is that it is partially inspired by real events - the murder of actress Sharon Tate by members of Charles Manson's cult. This was a controversial move, putting a real case in an otherwise fictional story. But then again, it wouldn't be Tarantino if it didn't have a controversy surrounding it.It mostly follows two fictional characters - washed up actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo di Caprio), and his stuntman, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Dalton starred in a fictitious old western show called Bounty Law in the 50s and seeks to reinvigorate his career. Booth is a stuntman with a military background who frequently drinks. Both these characters are very strong, with excellent performances from both actors. Margot Robbie plays Tate and delivers a fantastic performance. While those three get the most attention, the movie is bolstered by an outstanding supporting cast, which includes Al Pacino, Zoe Bell, Timothy Olyphant, Dakota Fanning, Luke Perry in his final role, and many, many more.While the film is technically about Dalton and Booth, perhaps it's more about the time and place. The film feels like an ode to 1960s Los Angeles, basking in the style, imagery, and sounds of the time, also delivering a selection of songs from the time. A common criticism of the movie was that nothing much happens, that there's too little plot. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is not a story, it's a portrait of a time and place. The greatest strength of this film is quite possibly the way it transports the audiences to the streets of Hollywood. The lengths that they went to to bring this image of a bygone age to the big screen is incredible. Several Hollywood icons of the day appear in fictionalized versions, including Bruce Lee, Roman Polanski, and Steve McQueen. And, of course, it has that distinct Tarantino style that we know and love. The only distinct feature of Tarantino movies that's missing is the violence. This is his least violent movie by far.The film, like any good Tarantino movie, garnered quite a bit of controversy. The most controversial bits are the scene with Bruce Lee, which got the film banned in China (although that's not that hard to do), and the scene at the end with Sharon Tate. In regards to these things, the title of the film is worth considering: 'Once Upon a Time' in Hollywood. Once upon a time, the opening words of fairy tales. Perhaps that's what this is. Hollywood's version of Hollywood's past. In that respect, you could call it a work of pulp fiction.Personal aside: out of sheer coincidence, I saw this movie in theaters on August 8, 2019, the 50th anniversary of the murders.",9,3,4,28 March 2020
Aladdin," Fine, but no Match for the Original
","Aladdin is the latest in a long line of Disney live action 'reimaginings,' which have been a source of massive box office success, with 4 of them grossing over $1 billion. Since Aladdin was one of the most popular movies of the 90's, it was inevitable that it would be remade. While people still keep seeing them, their reception from critics has been less than positive, for the most part. Aladdin had buzz from the get go after a truly awful trailer. But all publicity is good publicity, and the movie made bank.Even though this movie isn't bad, per se, it's hard to not compare it to the original, which just shows how much better the original is. Take the Prince Ali song sequence, for instance. In the 1992 movie, it's a grand scale number with a sense of hugeness and importance. In this version, it sounds fine, but just feels like a Will Smith music video, not a grand number in a musical. The problem is that it doesn't feel as magical as the animated original. The reason for that is likely because animation as a medium allows for a greater suspension of disbelief, and therefore more immersion in the magic. In that regard, the overly CGI Cave of Wonders, for instance, seems less real than the animated version. The same can be said for the Sultan's palace. The sense of grandeur from either of these places is muted in the remake, where they're massive and imposing in the original.Aladdin actually did change some stuff significantly from the 1992 movie. It added a completely new song, Speechless, sung by Jasmine near the end. It's a pretty good song, and it's performed well. Some weird stuff happens on screen. Jafar's motives are changed almost completely. Instead of marrying Jasmine, he's now a political mastermind, trying to unite all the different kingdoms into his own empire.Another thing that needs to be said is Will Smith. He caught a lot of flak for taking on the role of the Genie, but he isn't bad in the role. The reason for this is because he doesn't spend the whole movie pretending to be Robin Williams. He isn't and he can't be. While they both are the same character, they are distinctly Robin Williams and Will Smith, respectively. This is good, as it lets Smith be himself and present the character in a way only he could. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott are Aladdin and Jasmine. They do give good performances, especially Scott, but it's hard to see them as Aladdin and Jasmine, because they aren't the 1992 characters.By the way, this movie does somewhat confirm a long-held fan theory, that the guy at the beginning of the movie is actually the Genie. That's a theory in the original but is self-evident here.",7,0,0,6 December 2019
The Lion King," A Visual Spectacle - That's About It.
","The Lion King is possibly the crown jewel of Disney animation, being considered one of, if not the, best in the Disney lineup, and also making nearly $1 billion in 1994, which was unheard of at the time. Given that the remakes have been extremely profitable, having Lion King come up was inevitable. Unlike the others, though, this is practically a shot-by-shot remake of the 1994 movie. The only changes are very slight, with very little being added. Therefore, the story and characters aren't changed at all to any extent. While it's true that there's very little in the way of originality, it's still a great story and these are still the great characters we know and love. After all, the original isn't beloved for no reason.This movie has one major saving grace: it is also easily one of the most visually impressive movies of all time. It's up there with the likes of Avatar and Life of Pi. The levels of realism put into everything in this movie - the animals, the beautiful landscapes, the plants, everything about it is incredible. The downside is that CGI animals, while they do look fantastic, do not connect to the human audience the way the animated characters do. Take Mufasa's death for instance. In the 1994 movie, it's one of the all-time saddest movie deaths. Here, the emotional impact is largely drained because these lions don't emote the way humans do. That, and we all see it coming. It's partially made up for with the talented voice cast, but it's not enough to save it.The cast is full of all-stars. Donald Glover is Simba, Beyonce is Nala, and James Earl Jones returns to play Mufasa, which is awesome. The songs are there, for the most part. Circle of Life is great as always, Can You Feel the Love Tonight and Hakuna Matata are classics, and I Just Can't Wait to be King was reinvented, taking out the stuff that only works in a cartoon. Be Prepared got nerfed, which sucks because that song's awesome. There's a new one called Spirit. After all, you don't hire Beyonce just to give her one song, right? Additionally, Hans Zimmer's score, kept from the original, is severely underrated.Lion King is a movie that I'm glad I saw in theaters, if only for the visual effects. If it doesn't win the Oscar for visual effects, that's a disappointment. I wish I had seen it in IMAX or something like that. Aside from that, it's just the same story we've known and loved for the last 25 years. And, I must admit, having been born in the late 90's, it was pretty cool to see that opening shot on the big screen. After all, these movies are made for 90's and 00's kids as much as today's kids.",7,2,6,22 July 2019
A Quiet Place," Tension at its finest.
","A Quiet Place made quite the stir, receiving critical acclaim and defying box office expectations. The idea is simple - a family tries to survive after Earth is invaded by aliens that attack anything that makes a sound. The best thing about this movie by far is the way it builds tension. It's not as jump-scare heavy as one might expect, but the few it has are extremely effective, especially the scene with the raccoon. Those who saw it knows what that alludes to. The lack of sound emphasizes the parts that do have sound, which makes even the smallest sounds seem massive. The aliens are shown, but after they're hidden from the viewer until maybe halfway through, making a Cloverfield sort of effect (which, by the way, there's a fan theory that this is a Cloverfield sequel). When any sound can attract the aliens, you realize just how noisy normal life is, and the difficulties of living this life are totally understandable. The audience is also left in a state of constant tension in the sense that you await the scare, you know there's danger lurking nearby, and you just want to watch to find out what happens. It's a very thrilling movie.The characters - who are not named in the movie - are still easy to relate to, and audiences can understand their troubles. Evelyn, the mother, played by Emily Blunt, is pregnant, and has to silently give birth while a monster stalks through the house. Why they decided to have another kid during this apocalypse I don't know, but it makes for great tension. Lee, the father, played by John Krasinski, who also directed it, has to look after and protect the kids while Evelyn has the baby. Regan, the daughter, is deaf, and feels responsible for the death of her younger brother two years before the movie takes place. Regan is also played by Millicent Simmons, who is deaf in real life, which is a nice touch. Marcus is afraid of the aliens, and has to go through a rite of passage of sorts with his dad. It's a simple cast of characters, but the tension makes the audience feel for them and root for them all the way.The trouble with this movie is that if you really think about it, especially in context of the ending, there are a lot of plot holes and things that don't make sense. First off, why aren't the monsters swarming around the waterfall? And if there are no monsters there, why doesn't the family live there? And best of all, how the hell did they not figure out how to kill the aliens if it's as easy as shooting them when there's a loud enough noise? Don't you think they would've figured that out within minutes of their arrival? These questions are dumb, but they do bring out some serious issues with the movie. However, the stuff that's good is really good, and that makes up for it. Horror buffs will love it, even if it is kind of dumb.And by the way, the trailer for this movie is one of the all-time best. It's almost completely silent and builds tension perfectly in just two minutes.",7,0,0,20 December 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," A Guilty Pleasure
","14 years after the release of Curse of the Black Pearl, Captain Jack Sparrow returns for a fifth adventure, Dead Men Tell No Tales. The Pirates of the Caribbean series at this point is one that can only be appreciated by fans, and those who have enjoyed the previous movies. Personally, I consider them guilty pleasures. While there is a lot to like about the first few, this probably should've been a trilogy, with At World's End being the last one. But that's not the case, and there are more adventures with Captain Jack Sparrow to be watched.A lot of the good stuff from the previous movies has returned. The sets, between the ships, the islands and seas, the towns, it all looks fantastic. Not only is it visually spectacular, it helps to give off the vibe of adventure that a movie like this should have. The soundtrack is fantastic. He's a Pirate is one of the best movie tracks of all time. As with most Pirates of the Caribbean movies, there's also a lot of supernatural stuff in it, and the undead continue to look fantastic. Of course, it's got to have some ridiculous over-the-top moments, which are always welcome. The most notable is when Jack and the gang steal a bank. Not just the money, the whole building. That kind of stuff is just fun and enjoyable, not much else to it.Unfortunately, the characters aren't as good. Captain Jack Sparrow is still the wild, witty pirate he's always been, but it's quite clear that a lot of the charisma has worn off. Depp still gives a good performance, as only he could portray this character. The other main characters are Henry, son of Will and Elizabeth, and Carina, an astronomer. These are some of the most bland and cliché characters I've ever seen. They're effectively 'not Will' and 'not Elizabeth.' What they should have done was have Henry and Elizabeth go together to break the curse, as that makes more sense than leaving Elizabeth out altogether. Javier Bardem plays Captain Salazar, the villain, who is actually pretty good. Bardem is a fantastic actor, and he plays the part of the undead captain very well. Killing off Barbossa would have been fine, but the context and nature of his death was extremely uncharacteristic. And the plot is rather similar to that of Dead Man's Chest.If what you want out of a movie like this is just an adventure on the high seas with pirates, the undead, ancient treasure, you'll like it. It's as simple as that.",7,2,2,31 May 2019
Coco," Pixar Delivers Again
","Pixar is widely regarded as one of, if not the, best animation studios in the world. With an extensive list of beloved films, and only a few that are considered subpar, they really do hold the highest standards in the industry. With that in mind, Coco is more than a worthy addition to the Pixar family. It takes place in Mexico and follows a child named Miguel, who dreams of being a musician despite his family's hatred thereof. On Día de los Muertos, he ventures into the Land of the Dead to seek his idol Ernesto de la Cruz, a famous musician he admires. Meanwhile, his ancestors try to return him to the Land of the Living, as he will die if he stays there too long. The story is very interesting, and keeps your attention quite well. The only real downside here is that if you've watched most of the recent Disney movies, some of the twists at the end will be rather predictable. Still, that's not enough to really detract from how good the movie actually is. As you can imagine, the music plays a major part in the story. 'Remember Me' is one of the best Disney songs lately, and possibly one of Pixar's best tear-jerkers. Given that Pixar is known for that, that's no small feat. 'Un Poco Loco' was very good as well. As with most Pixar movies, the characters are lovable, memorable, and well written. The characters, like real families, clearly love each other and wish the best for each other, despite the conflicts they have. That realism with the characters is one of the movie's strengths. Because of that, most of the story doesn't have a proper villain, because Miguel's family - living and dead, care for him dearly. The animation is some of the best ever made, which is to be expected coming from Pixar. The Land of the Dead looks spectacular and imaginative, and the color scheme is beautiful. The imagery that appears in Día de los Muertos celebrations in Mexico is shown here, and the way its reflected in the character designs for the dead is fantastic. The accuracy that goes into characters playing guitar is also outstanding. This is easily one of Pixar's best movies. And that's really saying something.It is also worth noting that Olaf's Frozen Adventure, the short before the movie, was way out of place. It wouldn't be bad as a TV special, but it's not the type of thing you want be stuck sitting through prior to the movie. Still, that doesn't detract from Coco itself.",10,0,1,15 January 2018
1917," Masterpiece
","Considered one of the best films of 2019 and a serious Oscar contender, 1917 tells the story of two British soldiers in World War One who have to save 1,600 of their fellow soldiers by informing their commander of a German trap being laid for them. The stakes are raised by the fact that one of those 1,600 is the brother of one of the two messengers. 1917 is intense, tragic, and a pure adrenaline rush.The thing that has garnered the most attention with this movie is the fact that it gives the illusion of being done in two takes and it looks like it is happening in real time. The result of this is perfect immersion. When you see from this camera's angle, it feels like you're really there and that you're going to deliver the message with them. It raises the tension greatly, in a movie that is tense by the nature of its premise. The cinematography, editing (how did it not get this Oscar nom?), design of sets and props, and sound are perfect. From a technical standpoint, it is quite possibly the best film of 2019.Throughout the film, we see various aspects of the reality of WWI, and all of it seems very plausible in its presentation. We see life in the trenches at the beginning, a relatively calm place all things considered. We see the deathly hell of No Man's Land, complete with a plethora of partially decomposed corpses, humans and animals. We see what civilians had to go through in the scenes in Ecoust. We see a battle, but not exactly the heat of it. And it all ends calmly. All of these factors combine to make it seem very real. When you watch this movie, you feel like you are part of it. Director Sam Mendes has said that the inspiration for this movie was a story told by his grandfather about his experience in World War I. That being said, you can imagine this being an old man's story of war, how he and a dear friend went on a mission together, and it adds a layer of authenticity to it. 1917 is exhilarating, heart-wrenching, engaging. It is one of the best films of the decade and a worthy contender for Best Picture.",9,9,13,4 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," It's Something Different - But in a Good Way?
","Not only was this easily the most hyped movie of 2017, it was also quite possibly the most divisive and controversial. Personally, I go under the mindset that 'I don't care what they do, as long as they do it well.' That being said, I found this also to be the most conflicting movie of the year. I began to question my moviegoing mantra. Never has there been a movie that I simultaneously love and hate with a passion. I can understand why this movie gets so much hate online, and why some people defend it so much and really love it. There is an endless amount of discussion topics, and so much to talk about. All in all, I don't even know what to say about this movie. There is so much to say about this movie, and it's virtually impossible to not talk about and properly assess it without going deep into spoiler territory. Of all the main spoilers, the most surprising was the death of Supreme Leader Snoke. Personally, I'm not convinced that he's actually dead. Given the sheer power he has, and the major deceits he was able to pull off by manipulating Rey and Kylo Ren, it is reasonable to believe that he did not actually die there. If he did, then that was a tremendous waste of what could have been a great villain, and an enormously stupid way to end a character with so much mystery around him. Luke, on the other hand, died the death of a true hero. It wasn't the tragic sort that Han's was in Force Awakens, where it feels like he died in vain, it was that of a true Jedi Knight. He completely redeemed himself in the end of any issues his character had at the beginning. The other big spoiler is that Rey's parents were bums who sold her for drinking money. Some people were upset about that, but I'm OK with that. It's a twist you really wouldn't see coming.There's a lot of stupid crap in this movie. Luke's character at the beginning of the movie was the opposite of what fans wanted to see for so long. I'd rather have him be simply hesitant to train Rey than to have completely given up on the Force. I was really pissed off that they killed Admiral Ackbar at first, but then I realized his actor died in real life, so it makes more sense. The Resistance as a whole, especially Poe and Admiral Holdo, got way too much screen time. The whole thing with Holdo demeaning Poe for being a 'flyboy' is stupid, because without flyboys, the Trade Federation would probably rule the galaxy. I'd say Holdo made up for it at the end, though. Canto Bight was lame. The whole thing with Finn and Rose, two characters that could have been so much better, sucked. Benicio del Toro shouldn't have been in it at all. He looks and acts like he got kicked off the set of Rocky. Rose is the second worst Star Wars character (because the worst spot is reserved for Jar Jar), and says possibly the dumbest thing I heard in a movie all year. Even if Snoke is still alive, they wasted so much potential for him in this movie. And some scenes are strikingly similar to scenes from the Original Trilogy, particularly Return of the Jedi. There's still plenty to like, though. This is still a Star Wars movie, and this was Luke's first major appearance since 1983. Even though I wish they could have done him better, it's still Luke Skywalker on the big screen again, and I'm happy that he's back. And there are all the classic, lovable things you'd expect; the opening crawl, Chewie, C3PO, R2D2, the Millennium Falcon... all that good stuff. Yoda's appearance was wonderful. And, as usual, John Williams delivers yet another successful score. One of my complaints with Force Awakens was the lack of new vehicles, which this movie more than made up for. Crait is a cool new planet. Kylo Ren is a much better villain that he was in Force Awakens. While Rian Johnson definitely made some questionable decisions while making this movie, the cinematography was very clever and original, and the movie was visually spectacular. The space battles and action sequences were fantastic. The hyperspace kamikaze was amazing. I'd say the good outweighs the bad. All things considered, this is definitely one of the weakest Star Wars movies, if not the weakest, but it's still a good movie in its own right. Honestly, I feel like this would be better as a standalone film with a whole set of new characters.",5,1,2,15 January 2018
Snowden," Decent Political Drama
","This dramatization of Edward Snowden's 2013 leak of classified NSA information is far from best movie ever, but far from the worst. The most notable aspect is that Joseph Gordon Levitt does a good job at portraying the controversial whistleblower. Levitt is a great actor, and this is one of his finest performances. He does exactly what any good movie, especially one about a real, living person should; it shows the audience how he got to his place, what his actions were, and why he did them. That way, the audience can relate to him, understand him, and make a more informed judgement on his actions. The rest of the cast is generally well acted, which is good. However, there are detracting elements. First off, this movie has possibly the most pointless sex scene I've ever seen. Pointless sex is one of my least favorite movie tropes. It seems like it was there just to reaffirm that the movie would be rated R. Second, it has really unnecessary cameos by presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton (bearing in mind this movie came out a month before the election), in which they both condemn Snowden's actions. It just felt forced. Therein lies one of the problems with the movie as a whole: unlike much of Oliver Stone's other stuff, it doesn't seem like it's trying as hard as the others to be controversial. Oliver Stone is known for his controversial content, and we've come to expect content that would start conversation, like Snowden did. This isn't exactly it. It feels more like a historical drama that a current political movie. Generally speaking, though, your views of Snowden as a person will reflect your views on this movie. If you think he did the right thing, you may like it. If you think he's a traitor, you probably won't. It's rather simple that way, but there's not much more to it.",6,0,1,24 January 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Good overall, but not as much as the first
","The first Guardians of the Galaxy movie is one of the most popular comic book movies thus far, with its memorable cast of colorful characters, spectacular visuals, and pop culture references from the 1980s. The Guardians return here for another adventure, where Star-Lord meets his father, Ego. The strength of the first movie was how this band of drastically different characters functions, which the second movie builds on successfully. It explores character relationships in pairs - we see interaction between Star-Lord and Ego, Gamora and Nebula, Rocket and Yondu, and Drax and Mantis. It's just as action-packed and funny as the first movie, but they spend most of it separated. In addition, Ego is one of the MCU's best villains so far, with a good performance by Kurt Russell, an interesting backstory, and an awesome set of powers. The twist with him at the end was totally unexpected (in a good way). Much like the first movie, the soundtrack and visual effects are highlights. The theme of music from the 80's continues, with the likes of Fleetwood Mac and the Electric Light Orchestra having songs featured in the film. The visual effects were spectacular, from the space battles to the planets, especially Ego's planet. The problem with it is that it feels like it's just trying to get the Guardians more screen time before Infinity War, making it seem like filler material for the MCU's overall story. The first Guardians movies introduced the Power Stone and gave Thanos more screen time than any other before Infinity War, so it was rather surprising to not see it connect to the overall story with the Infinity Stones, and have it not connect to Thanos. And a lot of people were upset at how drastically Mantis differed from her comic book persona. While I see the two as entirely different characters, it makes sense that that would upset long-time fans of the Guardians. Still, for fans of Marvel or comic book movies, this is a must watch. It's definitely a worthy addition to the MCU, even if it's not as memorable of important to the MCU's overall story than the first one.",8,0,0,4 October 2018
The Disaster Artist," Franco is Fantastic
","It's quite ironic that one of the movies most talked about in award season would be the story of the making of The Room, widely considered to be one of the worst films ever. I don't know if I should be proud or ashamed, but I've actually seen The Room. It's terrible, it really is, but it's also kind of... good, in a way. Some of the worst lines (Among them 'I did not hit her,' 'You're tearing me apart, Lisa,' and that weird chicken scene) are very quotable and super easy to mock, but there's an undeniable passion put into it. The Disaster Artist, on the other hand, is about the man behind the movie, the enigmatic Tommy Wiseau. James Franco's portrayal of Tommy is one of the best of the decade. The way he nails Tommy's quirks, unusual mannerisms, his odd way of speaking, and that distinctive hair he had going is astounding. I didn't see James Franco. I saw Tommy Wiseau playing himself, in a movie about himself. Tommy is an interesting character, in the movie and in real life, because despite living in the age of the Internet, very little is actually known about him. But despite being a complete stranger to the whole world, he goes and makes himself known, and follows his dream of making a movie. Even though he's sometimes hostile toward others, he has his dream and sets on it, and not giving up on making the movie. It made The Room seem like a movie within a movie, that this was the real deal. Aside from the performance, Greg is an interesting protagonist, and his relationship with Tommy is well developed. The story is balanced in a way where the audience sees the perspectives of both Tommy and Greg, and how the perceptions of The Room vary between them. It's a great movie about following your dreams, no matter the outcome. For fans of Tommy Wiseau and The Room, it's an absolute must watch.",9,3,3,9 December 2019
The Witch," Masterpiece of Horror
","At a time when horror movies are a dime a dozen, there are very few that manage to stand out from the crowd. The VVitch, or The Witch, is one of said movies. It's the work of Robert Eggers, who would later go on to do The Lighthouse. The premise is that puritan family in 1600s Massachusetts moves to the woods over a religious dispute and come to believe that they are being hunted by witches, or that there is a witch among them.The atmosphere in this film is fantastic. 80% of the movie is set in their small cabin and farm, with most of the remaining 20 in the woods. There is a strong sense of isolation, even among the group, which is felt by the audience. It's a very creepy film. It has zero jumpscares. The scary factor comes almost entirely from the tension built up throughout, and it's very effective.What's particularly notable about this film is the dialogue. It's not just set in the 1600s. They talk like it's the 1600s. The period accurate dialogue is fantastic and adds to the feeling of being in a different age. It's the same type of language you hear in Shakespeare. It feels very authentic. It's still understandable, because you still feel the weight of it in the visuals and emotion in the performances.Spoilers: the twist in this movie is the type that gets you off guard. The whole idea of the Devil taking the form of a goat is something that is known, as there is the image of Baphomet, a demonic entity seen in folklore who has the head of the goat. Everything about him is unsettling. The way he talks, the way he's barely visible... it's an unforgettable moment.",9,2,3,16 December 2019
Joker," Phoenix is Amazing, Film is Great
","Joker is a film that's garnered quite the reputation. It's quite different from any other film based on a comic. There's nothing comic-y about it. There are no superheroes, nothing mystical, and no comic book style humor. It's dark, gritty, and grounded in reality. Rather than be about the Joker as the villain we know, it's about Arthur Fleck's descent into madness, and his transformation from a down on his luck guy with an unspecified mental illness into the Joker. He goes through his mental health struggles, which mostly entails uncontrollable laughter and accompanying stigma, difficulties maintaining a job, caring for his ailing and unstable mother, a personal identity crisis, a health care system that can no longer support him, and his complicated relationship with his celebrity idol, talk show host Murray Franklin.It's often compared to two notable Martin Scorsese films; Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy. Much like Taxi Driver, it's a film where it's difficult to dissociate between what's literally happening and what's a product of Fleck's imagination. There are some things that are definitely real and some things that definitely aren't, but a lot of scenes, particularly the ones with Sophie. Also like Taxi Driver is the depiction of the city; bleak, run-down, and dark. The entirety of Gotham seems grimy and worn, making the idea of a city in shambles quite visible. Even Wayne Manor looks darker than it does in most Batman movies. The best scene in the movie is easily the scene where Joker goes on the Murray Franklin show. You know what's going to happen, and the tension built as a result is incredibly well done.Joaquin Phoenix's performance was perfect. He perfectly nails every aspect of this character. From the compulsive laughter to the awkward mannerisms, he gives a very unsettling performance, perfectly befitting his character. It's kind of pointless to compare him to Heath Ledger, as Ledger is Joker the anarchist while Phoenix is Joker the madman, but they're definitely on par with each other. Phoenix's performance is easily the most memorable and defining feature of this movie. Robert De Niro plays Murray, a comedian who Fleck looks up to before being mocked by him. He's very good in the role, and of course, brings in the King of Comedy allusions. Zazie Beets was also good as Sophie, managing to play in scenes that are literally happening and scenes that aren't.The other aspect, and the most controversial by far, is the perceived social commentary issue. This movie has led to a lot of social and political controversy for various reasons. Politically speaking, Joker himself says in the movie that he isn't a political person, and that none of what he does is political. Despite that, his actions are taken by the characters in the movie as revolutionary, and he is seen as such. Honestly, this movie wasn't nearly as violent as I expected it to be. It is definitely R-rated violence levels, but I guess all the hoo-ha surrounding it made expectations higher in that regard. The John Wick movies are drastically more violent than this. Something worth noting is that the movie does vilify the media. After Joker kills Murray, it immediately cuts to the news coverage of it, and throughout the movie we see that media coverage is the difference between Joker the revolutionary and Joker the guy who killed three people on the subway.One concern I had going into this movie was if it would be in any way stigmatizing to people with mental illnesses. Fortunately, it was not. The reason for this is because it is never stated that Arthur Fleck has any particular mental illness, only that he has one.The film also is intended as a standalone, unlike most comic book movies these days. Despite this, it does give a possible sequel hook, and how he could be the Joker that we know, and also hinting at the origins of Batman. However, it was pointless to include Bruce Wayne, because he would need to grow up another 10-15 years to become Batman. But that doesn't really matter too much. Joker, standing alone, is an excellent film and a new page in the story of comic book movies. Whether it gets a sequel or not, there's no doubt this film will be talked about for a long, long time.",8,2,4,22 November 2019
It Chapter Two," Decent, Not as Good as the First
","It's widely agreed upon that no matter what version, the first half of It is better than the second. It's been 27 years since the Loser's Club defeated Pennywise, and everyone's favorite demon clown has returned for more. The kids, now adults in their 40s, get back together to defeat the monster one more time. However, they've all lost their memory, except for Mike, and most of the movie is spent on them going through Derry trying to regain them by collecting items from their pasts. It's not bad content, per se, it just feels like filler and takes way too long. The movie's runtime is 2 hours, 44 minutes. That's excessive for a movie like this.However, it's balanced out by absolutely fantastic performances. Bill Skarsgard returns as Pennywise, and he's perfect. He doesn't talk as much this time around, but he nails all the gestures and mannerisms of being a creepy clown. He's just as good as last time. The other person who garnered a lot of attention is Bill Hader as Richie. Deservedly so, as he does exactly what he should, act like grown-up Richie. The rest of the adults, including Jessica Chastain as Beverly and James McAvoy as Bill, also do their part, and we do see the kids we knew all grown up. Since we get this microcosm of their lives, there's a lot of emotion put into it with how they cope with their memories and facing their fears through a completely different, more grown up lens.There's still more to dislike, unfortunately. The scares were way too predictable. After the first few, you can easily do a '3, 2, 1, jumpscare' countdown in your head. Plus, there are way too many jumpscares. Henry didn't need to be in this at all. I know he's important in the book, but hey, Lord of the Rings worked without Tom Bombadil, so this could work without Henry. All he does it eat up runtime. All in all, It: Chapter 2 doesn't come near the heights of the first movie, but it wasn't expected to. It's a decent film, but it's not going to be one of the most remembered horror movies of all time like the first one.By the way, there is reportedly interest in making a cut of It that intertwines scenes from both movies into one massive, 5-hour movie. That would be awesome.",6,0,0,29 January 2020
Murder on the Orient Express," Solid Adaptation
","Agatha Christie is widely considered one of the best mystery writers of all time, and Murder on the Orient Express is widely considered one of her best works, so it's a perfect combination for a good movie. This is, of course, not the first time this novel was adapted for the big screen, and the original 1973 version is a classic. This version doesn't do much to add to the story, but it still succeeds. Here, the best parts are the acting, with an A-list cast, and the cinematography. The cast includes the likes of Kenneth Branagh, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Willem Defoe, among many others. Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of Hercule Poirot was enjoyable to watch and loyal to his character in the book. And the moustache. That alone deserved the Oscar for 'Best Makeup and Hairstyling.' The costume design was fantastic, and all the characters, despite being familiar faces, look great in their period clothes. The set design was equally good, with the train itself looking classy and elegant. The whole look of the train and the people on board brings the viewers back to the 1910s, to an age of transcontinental train travel.The movie does have its faults, however. It is a two-hour movie, so it can't be as in-depth as the book, but it's stupid how fast Poirot figured out the connection between Ratchet and the Armstrong case. And, as stated earlier, it doesn't really do much to add to the story. I don't have a problem with that personally, but some may consider that a detracting element. And, of course, it's not exactly like the book. While it would be nice if the movie were completely true to the book, nothing particularly egregious happens in this version. Even still, this is a very solid movie, and a great adaptation, especially for the faithful portrayal of Poirot.One thing that must be said; Murder on the Orient Express is notable for its plot twist. If you haven't read the book and don't know what happens and how it ends, go read the book. The book is much better than any film adaptation, and the ending is all the better. In this version, the only changes to the ending are how it goes down. Poirot tells his findings outside the train. Either way, don't find out the ending by watching this version.",8,1,3,16 January 2019
Wonder Woman," A Great Surprise from Struggling DC
","Given how disastrous things had been going for DC prior to this film's release, with abysmal films such as Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad, expectations here were rock bottom. Imagine the surprise when the critics began raving over this one. I can honestly say this was one of the best surprises of 2017 in movies. While in the previous films Superman was turned into an emo and Batman into a murderer, Wonder Woman is exactly what we'd like out of a movie hero; determined, powerful, but always still learning. Gal Gadot's performance was great, establishing herself as one of the breakthrough stars of the year. The other performances by Robin Wright and Chris Pine were pretty good as well. One of the most surprising things was how it managed to be dark without going overboard. It's darker than most comic book movies, dealing with things like mass murder of civilians, but it doesn't try too hard like BvS did. Now, there are some downsides. If you know your comic book movies, you'll see that the climax and ending were ripped straight out of Captain America: First Avenger. They are essentially the same scenes. While Ares is definitely an improvement over Eisenberg's Luthor and Leto's Joker, DC still hasn't gotten the villains down yet. The idea behind him is cool, but the way he acts toward Wonder Woman is quite similar to how Joker acted toward Batman in The Dark Knight. Still, this is by far the best DCEU film so far, and one of the most surprising movies of the year. It also set plenty of records for women in filmmaking, including highest grossing movie directed by a woman. That's especially good because the more records that get taken away from 50 Shades of Gray, the better. In all seriousness, this was a massive step in the right direction for DC, and one of the best comic book movies in recent years.",8,0,1,25 January 2018
Black Panther," One For the Ages
","Black Panther is easily one of the most talked about movies in recent memory. A lot of it stems from the fact that it's (debatably) the first mainstream blockbuster to have a predominantly Black cast, and also the first that deals with issues affecting Black people around the world. For a lot of people, this was more than just a movie. It was a cultural moment. That's completely understandable, given Hollywood's history of racism and underrepresentation. Black Panther broke all sorts of records, and reeled in over $200,000,000 opening weekend, in the U.S. alone. It's really making its mark, and for good reason.It also helps that it's one of Marvel's best. After T'Challa (Black Panther) stole the show in Civil War, people were excited to see him in a story of his own. In this movie, he has become the king of Wakanda, an African nation that mines Vibranium (the stuff Captain America's shield is made of) to create extraordinary technology but disguises itself as an impoverished, third world country. T'Challa is conflicted about whether he should continue allowing Wakanda to thrive as an isolationist country or if he should use its wealth and technology to benefit the rest of the world. He begins to discover what kind of king he's going to be when the throne is challenged by Killmonger, a soldier who seeks to start worldwide uprising and bring it all under Wakanda. Killmonger was easily one of the best villains in the MCU, if not the best overall. He has a charismatic and patient side, but also a violent and aggressive side. Without giving too much away, his last on-screen appearance was a very good scene. The other characters were also pretty good. Shuri was fun to watch with all her technology. Okoye had some great fight scenes. Ross was a good comic relief. M'Baku was a good character. Andy Serkis is one of the best actors to play a villain. The list goes on. One of the best things about the movie is the way it builds the world. You don't need to be familiar with the comics to understand Wakanda, and its people, culture, and traditions are shown in great detail, making it fascinating to watch. Wakanda is beautiful, the people, the landscape, and the futuristic cityscape. It also helps that the movie's soundtrack, which ranges from traditional African music to orchestral movie music to rap and hip-hop, is absolutely fantastic. The blend of traditional and futuristic is evident in the film, with the combat shown ranging from swordfights to aerial battles that look like they're right out of Star Wars. The rituals shown involving T'Challa's coronation were great. He participates in ritual combat, and talks to his deceased father in the Ancestral Plane, which reminds me of The Lion King. That's actually a downside to the film, without giving too much away, it's strikingly similar to The Lion King in several different ways, not just because it's set in Africa. Black Panther still does it very well, though. The people show the different cultures of Wakanda, which are based on real African cultures. There are articles online that document the real life inspiration behind some of Black Panther's imagery, and are great reads.In conclusion, Black Panther is an absolute masterpiece that has a great cast of memorable characters, an amazing world and culture within its setting, and a great albeit familiar story. This movie meant a lot for many people, and it was an absolute pleasure to see on the big screen. This one is very highly recommended.",9,1,8,1 March 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A Bad Place to Start From
","For DC to get their cinematic universe started with the introduction of more superheroes, they decided to begin with a rivalry between Batman and Superman, two of the most beloved comic book characters of all time. To say the least, this movie is a mess. Why? Well... Ben Affleck is a terrible Batman, it's boring as hell, the story is extremely convoluted and takes multiple viewings to understand, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor is quite possibly the worst casting decision of all time, it tries way too hard to be dark and edgy for its own good, they didn't make it clear enough that Batman was pushed over the edge, it has plot holes the size of the hole in the ozone layer, they completely wasted Doomsday, and the ending was just a massive insult to comic book fans everywhere. Perhaps the most egregious thing was the movie's trailer (attached to the Force Awakens, for everyone to see), which was loaded with spoilers. Here we see the two of them teaming up with Wonder Woman to fight Doomsday. First off, in a movie literally called Batman V Superman, showing them teaming up constitutes a massive spoiler. Second, Doomsday is known for one thing and one thing alone, so if you know the comics, you knew what was coming months before the movie came out. It's not the worst movie ever, and it does have some upsides. While Affleck's portrayal of Batman wasn't very good, he made an excellent Bruce Wayne. The beginning, where it's the ending of Man of Steel from Bruce Wayne's perspective, was pretty cool. But to start a universe, like what The Avengers did, this was not nearly enough. Even though Man of Steel isn't exactly the best comic book movie, a good movie that brought multiple heroes together is what could make the DCEU more enjoyable. Alternatively, a solo Batman movie that made it clear the Justice League was coming together would have done the trick. I know it was only 4 years after Dark Knight Rises, but unless those movies were going to be brought in to the DCEU (which wasn't going to happen anyway), they would have needed to reboot Batman again. What should have happened was a solo Batman movie that introduces Diana Prince (but saves her action for her own movie) that hints at the Justice League coming together, then Wonder Woman, then Justice League. Sky's the limit from there.",4,1,5,25 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Too Nostalgic, but Still Good
","With a series as beloved as Star Wars, anything is possible. The Force Awakens, the beginning of the sequel trilogy, is quite possibly the most anticipated movie of all time. The fact that it reeled in a record breaking $250,000,000 opening weekend in the U.S. alone is a testament to the popularity of this franchise. So, was it worth the wait? That's an interesting question. For many people, myself included, the nostalgia blinders came with the movie. The anticipation before the opening crawl and the euphoria that that classic opening note brought was an unforgettable experience. This movie brought out happy memories of watching the Original Trilogy for the first time, and the wonder and mystery that the galaxy of Star Wars brought us. However, the movie relies way too much on the nostalgia factor. The best and most memorable things about this movie (aside from that scene, of course) were the opening crawl, the appearance of the Millennium Falcon, the first appearances of the original characters (especially Han and Chewie), and the scene with Darth Vader's helmet. Aside from those things, it's a carbonite copy of the original 1977 movie, with the exact same story arc. There's very little originality, which is a massive detractor. Even the ships and vehicles are exactly the same, with a few exceptions. Of course, Starkiller Base is just another Death Star, even if the way it works is awesome. Even the character's roles feel recycled from the Original Trilogy. Rey is Luke (the desert dwelling, force sensitive protagonist), Finn is Han (The guy who tries to stay out of it but ends up coming back in), Poe is Leia (The one with the droid with the important message), BB-8 is R2-D2 (said droid), Han is Obi-Wan (The mentor who fought in the previous war), and Luke is Yoda (The Jedi who is now a recluse). While this is bad, it doesn't mean the characters are bad. They're not entirely recycled, but the roles they play certainly are.This isn't a bad movie, though. There really is a lot to like. The new characters were pretty good. With Rey, they set her up as a very mysterious figure, one you wonder about regarding who she is and where she's going. While Force Awakens doesn't reveal any of that, it sets it up for later installments. (By the way, this review is judging TFA independently from Last Jedi). Finn goes from being a cowardly deserter to someone who stands up and fights for his cause. Poe's nothing to write home about. Kylo Ren is simultaneously the best character in this movie and the worst. He's the best at the beginning, when you first see him in the black armor with the hood up. He looks awesome. Without the helmet, he's not so great. BB-8 is just about the cutest droid/robot ever. Also extremely marketable. Snoke was great. Han and Chewie really stole the show, mostly because of how long its been since they had screen time together. And also, unlike with the Prequels, when you know what's going to happen, as you've probably seen the Originals, there's a feeling of suspense where you know the characters you've grown to love are in danger, and you desperately want to see them come out OK. Oh, and, you know that feeling when you really want to talk about a movie spoiler but you can't because not everyone saw it as early as you? Yeah. This really went into effect here.Upon the first viewing of this movie, the nostalgia factor made it appear much better than it actually is. I thought this movie was a solid 9/10 after seeing it for the first time. It really isn't. It's still a good movie, though. Most of the callbacks to the original trilogy were welcome, the visuals are spectacular, John Williams continues his perfect track record, and most importantly, it got us interested in where they would take the series with the next installment.",7,1,6,2 April 2018
Incredibles 2," 14 Years Later, Pixar Delivers
","This was a long time coming. It was 14 years between the original Incredibles and the long-anticipated sequel. Who would have thought back then that Finding Nemo would have a sequel before the Incredibles? Heck, the Chicago Cubs would win the World Series before Incredibles 2 came out. What makes the wait especially bad is that Incredibles ends with a cliffhanger. For 14 years, we were anticipating this movie. Pixar's standards are as high as they can be for one studio. To that extent, Incredibles 2 is a good movie, but it's far from Pixar's best. It's not as good as the first movie. It's not as good as Coco or Inside Out either. But it's still a very good movie.Most of the new characters from the first movie returned. Here, Elastigirl goes out to save the world while Mr. Incredible stays home with the kids. It's pretty much the first movie, but with the roles reversed. And because of that, it often leads into territory where characters feel more like stereotypes than anything else. This is most evident with Violet and Dash, who fall into middle/high school stereotypes, whether it be bad grades or an upcoming first date. However, Elastigirl makes up for it by being a solid protagonist. She finds herself at crossroads, torn between parental duty and the superhero life. It's also interesting because she does begin to enjoy being a superhero again, which she actively spoke against in the first movie. Perhaps the most notable character is Jack Jack, who has dozens of powers, which he gained at the beginning of the first movie. However, he's still a baby. That being said, his few action scenes evoke classic cartoons, which is welcome in a modern movie. For instance, the Jack Jack/Racoon scene is very reminiscent of the Snoopy/chair scene from A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. Edna Mode returns, and she remains the fan favorite she was before. I'm not even sure what makes her such a good character. She's just Edna Mode. We also see the return of Frozone, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who's just as hilariously lovable as before. There are a whole host of new superheroes, most of which aren't particularly memorable, aside from their powers. The most notable is Void, who's essentially Syndrome, only not evil.Speaking of villains, Screenslaver was a bad villain. Disney/Pixar really needs to stop with the whole 'surprise villain' trend. It worked in Frozen because no one saw it coming. However, by my count, they've done it 3 additional times (Big Hero 6, Zootopia, Coco) between Frozen and now, so we've come to expect it. It happens more often than it doesn't now, and it's more of a game of figuring it out first. I figured out Screenslaver's identity almost immediately. Disney villains aren't as good as they used to be. Old Disney villains like Hades, Frollo, and Maleficent, to name a few, worked because they were fully developed characters. We don't really have those in Disney movies anymore. Speaking of villains, what happens to the Underminer? He just vanishes.As you would expect from Pixar, the animation is immaculate. Obviously, the best looking parts are the action scenes, with the variety of characters and their abilities. Since its animated, the action scenes can be much more fast paced than a live action superhero movie. The film's climax worked so well because of the way individual superheroes teamed up and used their powers cooperatively. But even still, the animation has even noticeably improved from the first movie. Pixar, in terms of animation, is the industry standard, and they've earned that title for a reason.",8,2,4,25 October 2018
Sully," Solid Movie about a Remarkable Moment
","One of the most remarkable incidents of the 2000s was when U.S. Airways Flight 1549 landed in the Hudson River on January 15, 2009. All of the 155 passengers on the plane survived. This dramatization of the incident, starring Tom Hanks, tells the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, who pulled off the Miracle on the Hudson, as it's called. Hanks gives a solid performance as Sully, who is conflicted as to whether or not he endangered the lives of all of the people on board. Aside from the incident itself, most of the movie is dedicated to the debate over whether or not the plane could potentially have returned to LaGuardia. The FAA is made out to be a villain of sorts. Some may argue that this is not as interesting as the incident itself, or that it isn't good movie material. It still works as a film, as it is more about Sully himself than anything else. Director Clint Eastwood does a great job at telling the story, by cutting the incident into several scenes and having the rest be about how it affected Sully's life, and that of his family. After the incident, Sully himself had to deal with PTSD, as well as the stress of instantly becoming a celebrity. His wife and daughters also had to deal with a constant bombardment of attention from the press. This is the focal point of the movie. It's about the people, not the incident. In that regard, it is a very good movie, but if you're expecting it to be about the incident itself, go watch any of the documentaries made about it.",8,6,7,15 January 2018
