The Ring," Scary...Very, very scary
","In an age where movies are dominated by sex, violence and swear words this movie reminds us that there maybe some talent out there.This movie is scary from the get go.  Its unique in the fact that there is jumpiness.  The jump factor is removed completely from this film.  It is tense, very tense.  As the days progress in the movie it becomes claustrophobic and even terrifying.  I recommend it.  It is scarier than the Exorcist.  More mind boggling than the Shining.  You will be thinking about this for at least 7 days.",10,0,0,22 October 2002
28 Days Later...," Original
","There seems to be a growing consensus that moviegoers are, on the whole, quite rude.  Cell phones, pagers, talking and the ever growing issue of babies at 1030p showings of horror films.  However, this isn't a posting regarding the people in the theater, but rather the film on the screen.28 days later hit the nail on the head by being a cinematography masterpiece, ala Kubrick.  The fast cuts and low-digital resolution speak to the nature of what is happening in the film.  It is not supposed to be clear and concise and neat, the world is ending!It does not live up to the 'scary as hell' hype.  However, it is successful and doing what it set out to do.  Deliver a commentary on the fall of human nature and although it manages to get a little preachy, the direction coupled w/ the acting ability made it envigorating.I suggest this movie to someone who is looking for something original.  It isn't a sequel, it isn't a major Hollywood blockbuster and you aren't going to find Jim Carrey, Vin Diesel or Keanu Reeves in it.  Finally, something different!Overall: A Acting: A+ Directing: B+ Story: A",Null,0,0,14 July 2003
Black Hawk Down," War-Exposed-
","War has become common place in our theaters and on our television screens. It is not unusual to see photos of slain bodies and dying children on the nightly news or even the latest parody sitcom or skit.  What we don't typically see is the war in full action.  Occasionally yes, however the actual battles between men are not fought on the news they are fought behind the scenes where cameras don't go.  Ridley Scott went there.Black Hawk Down took what Saving Private Ryan did correctly and made it work for an entire film.  Arguably the greatest 30 minutes in a war movie, SPR starts out with a bang only to fizzle for 2 hours and pick up again in the last 15 minutes.  Black Hawk Down starts as a slow burn, speeds to an increasingly rapid pace, and stops 2 hours later leaving the viewer feeling confused and exhausted.  Black Hawk Down takes the first 30 min of SPR and makes it a 2 hour feature film.  All the while showing, cleverly without character development, the effect on the human emotions, the fear instilled in men fighting and the anxiousness felt by those watching from the outside. Scott is on top of his game as he shows the mistake the U.N. and the U.S. made in battling an unknown enemy.  Bring out the Oscar! Give it a remarkable A",10,0,0,11 March 2002
