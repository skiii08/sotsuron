Walk the Line," Two Things Wrong With This Movie
","OK, I had two problems with this movie. It is an EXCELLENT movie, but, when Johny Cash did his concert at Folsom Prison, it was not with a bass so loud that it shook the walls. One good thing about the music of the 60's, was, the bass was not overpowering. The other thing wrong with this movie, was that it was not long enough. But, in order to do a full story of Johny Cash, It would probably have to be a 10 hour movie. So, I guess they did as much as they could, considering the time factor they had. Joaquin Phoenix was EXCELLENT as Johnny Cash. He looked like Johnny Cash, and ALMOST sounded like him. Reese Witherspoon almost had the voice down, as June Carter, but, I don't think she looked much like her. Still, she gave a wonderful performance. All in all, I'd give the movie a 9 out of 10 I guess.",Null,0,1,3 December 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Excellent Movie
","I saw this when it was released at the theaters. It was excellent on the big screen. When it came out on video tape, I bought it. But I had noticed some of the footage had been left out. I am wondering why. At one point in the movie, Everette tells his wife, that he is one of the Soggy Bottom Boys, and she does't believe him. I remember that she said, 'You are not one of the Soggy Bottom Boys', and don't go telling our girls that you were' or something to that effect. Because this was cut out, I wanted the DVD version, and my son bought it for me. Well, it was cut out of the DVD version also. Does anyone know why? Anyway, near the end of the movie, as the Soggy Bottom Boys are on stage singing, Everette's wife, drops her jaw open in disbelief, as if she were thinking, 'He was telling me the truth!' So, what happened to the part where he told her that he in the group? Thanks",10,0,0,10 April 2005
