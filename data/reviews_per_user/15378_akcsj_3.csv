Ford v Ferrari," Not a politically correct bone in its muscular body
","I hate car racing but this long movie - nearly 3 hours - held me fixed to the screen. Superb acting, astounding cinematography and a great story made it worth every cent.And the cars; this was a time when cars were not seen as being evil as climate alarmists tell us but both works of art and amazing bits of machinery. But the real essence of this story were the men who built and raced the cars.I recently wrote a review for the reboot of Charlie's Angels which was filled with snowflake issues and PC writing. A fun franchise had been ruined. Ford v Ferrari however demonstrates that Hollywood can still put out a great movie which hasn't been ruined by woke points of view. There were no little girls competing with the men in this incredibly tough occupation and boy did the movie benefit from that. Carroll Shelby, played by Damon and Bale as Ken Miles, both legends of racing and cars were spot on in a masterfully directed bit of recent history. Having said that Catriona Balfe was superb as Bale's wife.One of the year's best.",9,3,9,17 November 2019
Hereditary," Mean, irrational and dreadful. Sick of these horror movies
","Ok, so we have the king of hell, some boofhead who is worshipped by some over-weight Satanists led by some matriarch who can't tell the gender of her grand-kids and so puts the spirit, or something, of this king of hell into the grand-daughter instead of the grand-son. And to rectify this the grand-daughter has to die, along with the husband of the daughter and the body of the dead grandmother and daughter have to be decapitated before the spirit of the king, who has been wandering around, naked, and clothed, with an imbecilic grin on his face, can take over the son's body. Have I missed anything?The meanness comes from the suffering the poor family has to go through; the irrationality from the fact that it makes no sense for all this mundane mayhem to occur. If this king can inhabit bodies at will why doesn't he just do it? If he's dependent on some fat Satanists having to perform a SÃ©ance to bring him into reality he must be pretty puny.Just dreadful; although the segment of Toni Collette lurking in the ceiling corner is ok",1,6,13,11 June 2019
American Sniper," A great and timely movie.
",This is a great movie. The complaints that it stereotypes Muslims and presents them as one dimensional are in themselves stereotypes. The West is at war with Islam but such is the political correctness within the West that the West cannot even define Islam as the enemy. This movie captures perfectly the lacuna between the values of Islam and the West: there is no compromise or overlap in values. Islam makes this plain time after time. Chris Kyle is one small cog in this battle and he personifies what it will take to defeat Islam. The sacrifices he makes in respect of his personal life do have a element of cliché about them but this lack is more than compensated for by the verisimilitude of the battle scenes. Further poignancy to the movie is that Kyle's murderer was at the very least sympathetic to Islam even though there is no evidence that he had converted.,8,11,15,26 February 2016
