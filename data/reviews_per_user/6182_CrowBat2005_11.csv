The Devil's Advocate," 'A Sheep Amidst the Wolves'
","My initial reaction to the first time I saw this movie was 'woah.' I couldn't have pictured better fitting performances than the ones Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino and Charlize Theron gave. The chemistry between all of the actors on screen was exceptional. Of course, one can obviously expect a more than brilliant performance from the flawless Al Pacino. However, I was pleasantly surprised with Keanu's. He really shined when he rushes to his wife who has just killed herself. Charlize Theron was also very excellent in this movie and, once again, a perfect fit for her role.I feel that the ending of 'The Devil's Advocate' was the absolute best part of the whole movie. The plot takes you for a ride: you aren't sure whether Kevin is going to go through with helping his father or not. You can also breathe the heaviest sigh of relief when everything actually works out in the end. This was a fantastic film! I highly recommend it.",8,0,1,26 November 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Fun Savvy Movie
","What can be better than seeing a movie with Johnny Depp wearing makeup? NOTHING! Seriously, what a story. The first time seeing this movie, I felt it was too good to only receive the maximum of 3 out of 4 stars, and I still don't see why. First of all, the acting leaves you wishing you were in the shoes of a pirate yourself, whether you are on the good side or the bad. Personally, this was the performance of Johnny Depp's career, though he's had many, none were as recognizable or as fun to imitate as Captain Jack Sparrow. The cast is superb, the action is endless, and the comedy is more than funny. I feel this movie deserved to at least win ONE Academy Award. As for my nine out of ten rating, I've learned to accept the fact that 4 stars is the most and I've made a balance. 'Pirates of the Caribbean' leaves you dying to see the second.",9,1,3,27 May 2005
Troy," Good, but not Great
","Brad Pitt in a skirt: how nice. Besides the good looks of the cast, this movie was Wolfgang Petersen's failed attempt at a successful epic film. That doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable; it has its perks. Pitt's performance as the pompous Achilles is decent and Orlando Bloom shows us once again that he can play someone from an earlier time period successfully. Eric Bana's Hector was something that made the whole movie worth while. The major flaw to this film was the excessive amount of its main characters dying. This showed the devastation of war but left no one to enjoy their victory. I only hope that if some sort of spin-off is made from this film Sean Bean will be delightfully portraying Odysseus once again and finally take on a major leading role.",7,1,12,27 May 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," 'I'm not so bad once you get to know me.'
","'It is inevitable.' The final installment of 'The Matrix' has the power of any ending to a trilogy. Though it's not as powerful as its very first predecessor, I can't help but become depressed with the truth: 'Is it over?' 'I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be.' Hugo Weaving is the stand-out performance of the movie. Of course, Keanu Reeves continues his reign of a good actor since 1993 with his powerful expressions and the flare he adds to his every move. The entire cast is at its supremest, which is essentially the purpose for why this film affects me as much as it does. The effects are still ones to be marveled over, though one can't help but miss the usual 'I know Kung Fu' battles. The final fight is undoubtedly the most powerful one.Back to Weaving; he delivers such a performance that you feel ashamed to like him because of how evil he is. He's the guilty pleasure villain that is an absolute pleasure to watch with wonderment. Overall, all is powerful in the all powerful 'Matrix.'",7,0,0,26 November 2005
Spider-Man," Swinging into Action
","'Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Does whatever a spider can!' You know the song; you know the costume; you know the name. The comic book is brought to life in Sam Raimi's wonderfully fulfilling movie adaptation of the web slinger. Fans should not be disappointed with Peter's younger age: it's modern, right? Everything's hectic when you're a teenager, and you don't need to be a superhero to feel that way. Tobey Maguire makes a wonderful Peter Parker and an 'amazing Spider-Man.' He certainly makes the viewer feel Peter's dilemmas of his role conflicting life. But with every hero, you'll find a villain, and Willem Dafoe rises to the occasion playing the green clad rogue. He gives an outstanding performance as he allows the viewer to explore his inner psyche. Of course, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco didn't disappoint playing Peter's closest friends. You feel at the end of this movie, a sequel or two is something to highly look forward to with the high standard that is set.",9,0,1,27 May 2005
Batman Begins," 'Why Do We Fall?'
","This film was likely the best 'Batman' yet. It's the story of Batman that's skipped over in the '89 film, which can leave much to be told. Although, there is a retelling of how Bruce Wayne's parents were killed. The killer is a common criminal, not Jack Napier. This may not be easily accepted by avid fans of the '89 film. I feel it works. Also, this film brings Wayne's parents across as more caring individuals, especially his father, wonderfully played by Linus Roache, who has a deep caring for the poor, struggling people of Gotham City during times of depression.Everyone, as a matter of fact, was perfectly casted in this film. Christian Bale plays Bruce Wayne, as well as Batman, in a new, unique way. The voice he puts on as Batman, new and original, is fierce. Liam Neeson plays Henri Ducard wonderfully. Another difference from the '89 film is the addition of a childhood friend, played by Katie Holmes, who I thought was very good. Michael Caine was nicely cast as Alfred, as well as Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon.Another new face, next to Duccard, is the bookworm-like Jonathan Crane played by Cillian Murphy. He really shines when he tries to instill fear in others by assuming the Scarecrow. Tom Wilkinson was absolutely fabulous as Falcone. He's very convincing and draws you in immediately. I also enjoyed Morgan Freeman's performance; everyone was flawless.This film deals a lot with the concept of fear and the ability to face it. This recurring theme is exactly what should be emphasized with this type of character. Even with today's technology, this movie stays very real and is a must-see for even the oldest of 'Batman' fans. It has a lot of heart.After the fall, the 'Batman' franchise has managed to pick itself up again.",8,0,0,14 January 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A Sweet Treat!
","A Tim Burton movie. Hm... a line like that may automatically make movie-goers stray from ever seeing the movie. It did for me. The trailer and the fact that he was doing a new take on one of my childhood's classics made me very skeptical. However, I went to see it anyway for the wonderful Johnny Depp. I expected him to basically be the only enjoyable part of the movie.I was completely wrong. Burton did an AMAZING job. The movie is not a remake of the splendid musical as many may expect. It had another take on some elements which added more to the movie. You see young Willy and how his childhood affected him.The element of family importance is the main theme, I feel. Charlie is not flawed like the old version had which makes the movie slightly saccharine. But if you consider how a child can be severely grounded because of his or her poverty, it seems more real. Johnny did a superb job and I hope he gets an Oscar for his performance. :-)Overall, it touched me as 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Big Fish' did. So if you've got a sweet tooth, see 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' for a sweet treat!",9,0,2,27 July 2005
Big Fish," The Difference Between Lies And Stories
","I first got the urge to see this movie after I saw Tim Burton's brilliant take on 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.' All of his movies are usually filled with imagination and heart. 'Big Fish' has both. Only, there is less fun in all of the imagination when the main character's amazing stories of his life are questioned by his realistic son. The entire movie has sincerity and humor, only sometimes you're not sure if half of it is funny. Every actor gives their all, and I think that saves this movie even more. You wonder why this young man (Will Bloom) has so many problems with tall tales told by his dying father (Ed Bloom). It REALLY takes the fun out of the whole movie until the end. That may have been the plan the entire time.The last few scenes are what touched me the most. It shows that story telling makes life more exciting. What Ed Bloom was telling weren't lies, they were stories. Some people are too realistic, that they forget the fun of imagination. As soon as Will told that last story, you really try not to cry from what a wonderful story teller he had become.",8,0,0,3 August 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Better The Second Time
","After I saw 'The Matrix' several years ago, I thought to myself: this movie is so good! I was really surprised to hear that a sequel, let alone 2, were coming out back in 2003.When I first saw 'The Matrix Reloaded' I honestly was not thrilled. The effects were phenomenal and more astounding than its predecessor, but the story had almost disappeared. The movie basically became merely a film that relied on its effects to entertain its audience.Two years later, I gave 'Reloaded' and even 'Revolutions' another chance. I've got to say, they're both better the second and even the third time around. 'Reloaded,' as Laurence Fishburne said, is the 'life' component of the One's journey. It's a continuation, taking place six months after 'The Matrix', the 'birth' of the One, with the machines preparing to destroy Zion and all that is left of humankind. The best part of this movie is undoubtedly the fight between Neo and Smith, Smith, Smith, Smith, etc. In a sense, we find that Smith is becoming what he hates: a human that continuously multiplies 'until every natural resource is consumed.' Like he had said in the first one, another organism follows the similar multiplicative characteristic of humans: 'a virus.' Neo has become the representative of a human fighting off a virus. This symbolism becomes extremely prevalent in the final installment.The worst part of this movie, when I had first seen it, was the scene when Neo meets the Architect. He lays out important plot material, but because of his language and how he drones on, you almost feel Neo is a high school kid and the Architect is the monotonous teacher. I had dazed out the first time until Trinity was brought into the picture. You almost get the sense that Neo did the same thing. After seeing the scene again, the Architect basically tells Neo that the Matrix is an ongoing cycle where the human race is created, destroyed, and recreated; another cycle is about to take place. Because this message was brought about in the way it was done, it's almost slightly comical.The film ends with Neo's mind trapped in the Matrix and Smith inside Zion (he copied himself into Bane when he was in the Matrix). Now, originally the last two installments of 'The Matrix' trilogy were one movie. I can't help but wonder if it would have made both movies even better. The focus would have remained more on the One and Smith would have been seen as the greater threat he was supposed to be (this goes especially for the third). Overall, you need to give 'Reloaded' another chance. There's much more heart than you can initially observe.",7,1,2,5 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Good, But Not Perfect
","Well, I definitely felt 'Episode 3' was better than the second. However, I found it slightly disappointing. The effects were mesmerizing and the light saber battles did not disappoint me, but I wound up expecting more from this movie because of the awesome trailer. The ending, I feel, could have definitely been better. I also feel James Earl Jones should have had more to say. He should have had a line or two at the very end when he's staring at the Death Star being built. Ewan McGregor was a perfect choice for Obi Wan Kenobi and certainly enriched the spirit of the film. Overall: decent but it unfortunately did not live up to the standards left by the saga's predecessors.",10,2,6,27 May 2005
The Island," Good Story, Bad Directing
","Could there be anymore chase scenes? I enjoy action movies but with this one, there's a point where I said 'enough is enough!'If you haven't seen the trailer, heard about the background, and you like the element of surprise, I suggest that if you plan on seeing this film, see it before you find out anything. Well, for those of you who have yet to see it, plan to, and have done one of the above, I feel you may be slightly disappointed when Lincoln and Jordan discover the truth: they're clones. That tiny intrigue for the audience is unfortunately spoiled by t.v.Overall, this movie had a good story but a silly action director who didn't know that there's more than action to some movies. I felt there were too many 'macho man' and 'be-on-edge' shots. They kept your interest, however, and they did entertain me, but it didn't make sense how this underground corporation got away with destroying half the city just to cover up the clones' presence in the city. I guess it's things like that that separate your action flick from your action movie. I feel that the acting was good. I especially enjoyed Ewan as Tom Lincoln. I hadn't seen him act like a jerk until this film and I found it refreshing. Scarlett Johansson seemed like she was casted merely for her looks. Don't get me wrong, it's nice to look at good looking people, but there again the action movie/action flick line is drawn. Even Sean Bean, who we all know as LOTR's Boromir, was his bad self and did a good job. But I feel Michael Bay is at fault for all of the bad reviews that are surrounding this movie. If you look past the stereotypes and corny action flick lines, ('They're gonna hack you up.') you'll find a decent story that was unfortunately wasted.",4,0,1,28 July 2005
