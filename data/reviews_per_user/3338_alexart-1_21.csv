Sucker Punch," Pulp Objectification
","In a day when Hollywood craves good original screenplays, Sucker Punch proves that some filmmakers should stick to adapting great source material. An exuberantly bad pastiche of genres, Sucker Punch is the anti-Quentin Tarantino film. Zack Snyder's story is mashup of several different genres, none of which prove successful in the long run. The number of believable lines in Snyder's screenplay can be counted on two hands, thus providing very little material for the potentially good cast of women to work with. Snyder clearly doesn't know how to construct a visually disinteresting shot, but it all doesn't matter because the film trips over its own feet constantly.Sucker Punch is told from the point-of-view of Babydoll (Emily Browning), a young girl who is sent to an asylum by her father after she accidentally kills her sister in the bravado opening sequence. It isn't too long before Babydoll realizes that she is scheduled for a lobotomy. Her vivid fantasies cause her to realize escaping is her only way to survive. Babydoll enlists the help of the girls in her ward to help guide her through her intense journey out of the asylum. The supporting cast includes Abbie Cornish, Carla Gugino, Vanessa Hudgens, Jena Malone, Jamie Chung, and Scott Glenn. Look for a brief performance from Jon Hamm at the very end.What's good about this film is, indeed, pretty good, however there are very few things I can say in this area, unfortunately. Zack Snyder is a visual extraordinaire. His slow motion shots of flying weaponry and spinning girls are a wonder to watch. Larry Fong, the cinematographer for 300 and Watchmen, does wonders with the supersaturated blacks and oranges that create a moody contrast between fantasy and reality.The story is bizarrely fragment and surprisingly boring. Four 20-minute action sequences punctuate the storyline involving the asylum, which is unfortunate because that was the only one I was actually interested in. The beginning and end are worth seeing for their emotional intensity and surprising depth, however the war/samurai/dystopian/medieval fantasies are flat and plain, despite the action displayed on screen, which should be rich but isn't at all. Very often, the story sucker punches itself and doesn't every get back up.Sucker Punch is meant to be an action movie and yet its action sequences are the least interesting parts. Each one attempts to allude to a previous great film in its respective category, but each one is unsuccessful. Furthermore, the choreography of each fight is exactly what one might expect; there isn't a single thing that excites or creates any sort of reaction.Zack Snyder has clearly stated that Sucker Punch was supposed to be 18 minutes longer with an alternate ending. The question is, do I care? The answer is yes, oddly enough. Sucker Punch has the strange potential to be a classic. After all, how many films received negative reviews upon their initial release and ended up in cult fandom?One other shortcoming of this film that should absolutely be noted is the treatment of women. Although Sucker Punch wants to be a feminist movie, it actually turns out to be demeaning more than anything. Scantily clad women are sexualized throughout the entire film, and it is our job to be thrilled by the imminent danger of rape and abuse that so often happens in the asylum. It's scary to think that somebody let this kind of plot happen in this day and age. Sucker Punch truly hit me hard, but not in a good way. The objectified, stiletto-wearing protagonists stumble through the entire middle third, making the good beginning and ending moot. The cast is oddly bland, but Snyder makes up for it with his impressive visuals. Overall, Sucker Punch is an experience people shouldn't enjoy. It's a post-post-modern mess that will be remembered as a geekgasm, for now at least.",2,22,45,2 April 2011
Se7en," Dark, Disturbing, Moody, and Excellent
","David Fincher has always had a very different style from that of other directors. Whether it is The Curious Case of Benjamin Button's drowned out feel or Fight Club's frenetic hipster camera-work, it's Se7en that definitely is his best film. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt give excellent performances while the script engrosses the audience. Any way one looks at it, this film is great and there's no doubt about it.Se7en follows two detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) in their search to find 'Jonathan Doe' (who later appears as Kevin Spacey), a murderer who has been leaving crime scenes that follow the Seven Deadly Sins. Freeman is great as an old, wise detective who is ready to retire while Pitt only good as a cop turned detective who is looking for action. Pitt's wife, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, makes for a good secondary character who is constantly trying to relate to the two detectives in their search. As the detectives push further to solve the case, the crime scenes become grislier and tensions rise in the corrupt, rainy unnamed city.There's many great things about Se7en, but one of the best is the opening credits. One might ask how the opening credits can be so great, but it must be seen to be believed. The opening credits consists of many cut together shots of someone, presumably 'Jonathan Doe', creating a disturbing notebook of photographs and letters set to music that is barely even music, but rather just creaking. Most of the shots are shaky and overexposed and yet so beautiful. How is it possible that something so beautiful? Only David Fincher could achieve a sequence so effective. The credits set the tone wonderfully through the movie and, if watched very closely, clues to the plot can be unlocked. If anything, the credits are worth a look.To continue explaining Fincher's greatness, one must explain how he creates the tone of the movie and what he does that makes the viewers feel disturbed by the end of the movie. Although there is almost no violence on-screen, the crime scenes are enough to make people feel sick. Every shot in the movie is very dark and almost hard to understand. There are no shades of bright colors throughout the whole movie. These dark shots, which may remind many viewers of Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, give the film a very gloomy feel that no other film really does. Combine the shades of black and gray with the gruesome crime scenes and one gets a very dark and creepy movie.There really is no other way to say it: Se7en is quite an amazing movies. There's some brilliant direction from David Fincher (as per usual) and great performances from the cast. The movie is thrilling and at the same time brutal forcing audience members to wonder whether or not they would like to finish the movie. Roger Ebert once said that a true film buff sees films that nobody else has heard of. I must say that I disagree. To become a true film buff means seeing movies like this and then appreciating and understanding them. It is a movie like Se7en that stands the test of time and is universally regarded as wonderful by movie buffs and everyday movie watchers alike.",10,0,2,17 February 2010
Hostel," Pointless 'Horror' Movie
","Hostel is no great horror movie. It is mostly explicit sex and graphic violence.It is about two friends who travel to somewhere in Europe for sex. Of course, in slasher movie style, the find something more than just sex. Aside from the beautiful girls, they find a place where people are brutally tortured and killed.When I first saw this on demand, it was free, so I thought I'd watch it. After it, I thought to myself, I want those 90-something minutes of my life back. The first 30 minutes of it are sex and the rest is all violence. This is no horror movie.",2,0,2,25 January 2008
500 Days of Summer," Summer of Love
","What is (500) Days of Summer exactly? Well, it's probably one of the best movies in your movie theater for starters. It's a well acted, beautifully shot look at love, heartbreak, and fate. While it's not your typical summer movie, it's still one that you should see.The not so typical story of the movie follows a non-linear timeline. The title refers to the 500 days that Tom, played by the up-and-coming Joseph Gordon-Levitt, must endure and feel the effects of love and longing. The movie begins with a distraught Tom after Summer (Zooey Deschanel) has broken up with him. When he tries explaining his story to his little sister, she tells him to start from the beginning, and so he does. Throughout the course of the movie, the story unfolds in an interesting manner as we find out what caused the break-up.Though you may be thinking that the movie is hipster trash, it's not. Yes, it's quirky and often includes elements that would attract many hipsters (constant pop culture references, art jokes, the fact that it's a Fox Searchlight film), it's a film for everyone. Some parts of it are so quirky that you're almost forced to laugh.The acting is another great thing about this movie. We feel exactly what the director, Marc Webb, wants us to feel, but only due to the intense emotions portrayed by the characters. As Tom begins to experience depression, we feel it too. It's impossible not to fall in love with Summer's intense blue eyes and lovely personality. This intensity is also due, in part, to Marc Webb's visuals. The best example of this is a scene where Tom first has sex with Summer. The next day he wakes up and sings as he's walking to work. The scene is the only musical scene and yet, it's choreographed better than most musicals.So there you have it. (500) Days of Summer is a charming look at the beginnings of a relationship, the end of a relationship, and recovery. It poses the stunning question of 'What is love?' through it's well-written script and sweet performances. As the narrator says in the beginning of the film, 'This is not a love story.' and it truly is not. It's a look at what happens after a love story. (500) Days of Summer is the year's most quirky look at love and least predictable romance comedy ever. I think I'm in love.",10,1,2,5 August 2009
Midnight in Paris," Parisian Holiday
","'Do you think it's possible to love two women at the same time?,' asks our protagonist Gil Prender to a tour guide discussed Auguste Rodin's love for his mistress and his wife. Like that's the first time we've heard that question in a Woody Allen movie. Infidelity, gorgeous women, and neuroticism are some of Allen's favorite motifs, so it's really not too much of a surprise that they all appear in Midnight in Paris.That said, Allen's rendition of those ideas feels fresh this time. Midnight in Paris is a sweet, fun romp through the art world of France. This light comedy may not have some of the heavier messages about adultery and art that previous Allen films have had, but Midnight in Paris is, nonetheless, an enjoyable exercise in allusion to the Lost Generation and artists of the 1920s.Midnight in Paris begins with the same idea of a man, in this case a screenwriter named Gil played by Owen Wilson, searching for connection with the real world. The protagonist is clearly a projection of Allen's self, but no matter. Gil is engaged to the Inez, played by a blond Rachel McAdams who coincidentally (or is it?) looks like Scarlet Johansson from Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Inez bores Gil with her pretentious friends and spiteful parents, which ultimately causes Gil to seek inspiration on his own time by drunkenly wandering that streets of Paris. One night, he is invited into a car that takes him back to the 1920s where he meets his favorite writers and artists, something that eventually leads to a breakthrough in his work. A large supporting cast includes Kathy Bates, Allison Pill, Adrien Brody, Michael Sheen, and Marion Cotillard.Allen's conception of Paris is just as romantic as the story itself. The film's physical look matches some of the complexities of the women in that it appears to be almost splashed in gold. It is, after all, the City of Lights. It's a beautiful movie that matches the pretty faces of its starring women.Allen's screenplay leaps right off the page thanks to his cast, but this too is something that isn't unusual for a Woody Allen film. At his best, Allen picks actors that play their parts with a sense of realism that, when combined with some elements of the fantastic, charm the audience. Just about everyone here manages to do just this, with the exception of Rachel McAdams, who tries her hardest with an underdeveloped character. Marion Cotillard is the best of the cast (as per usual) in her role as Picasso's mistress. She's bursting with sexuality yet she's grounded in her ability to deliver her dialogue with her natural French accent.Midnight in Paris is fantastique. In comparison to Woody Allen's previous tales of lust and spite, his newest film feels like a dessert rather than a filling entree, yet this is exactly how a good, highbrow summer movie should be. The cast shines just as bright as the lights at the top of the Eiffel Tower and Allen proves himself worthy of his place in society as a master director once again. By no means a classic, Midnight in Paris is a pretty little diversion, one that is grounded in a theatrical gimmick that totally works every time. This, along with The Tree of Life, will be one of a few summer movies that will dazzle visually (without explosions) and somehow manage not to insult the viewer's intelligence.",8,163,213,30 May 2011
Zodiac," Chilling. Thrilling. Well Done!
","'This is the Zodiac speaking' says the Zodiac killer (also known as Sam) in a truly chilling scene where he has a conversation with a news reporter. Fincher has definitely done a great job with the film 'Zodiac'.As you can already tell, the film is about the true story of the Zodiac killer. A cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle (Jake Gylenhaal) hears about the case and begins to do his own investigation of it along with the help of a writer (Robert Downey Jr.) and an inspector (Mark Ruffalo).Among the highlights of the film are the three murder scenes. The scene that is probably most memorable is the one with the mother and the child. The scene feels so realistic as we see the mother in the road crying and explaining how she threw her baby out of the truck to save him. This goes without saying that the acting is truly fantastic.Zodiac is a film that probably will not be appreciated by some, but when you have the patience to sit through all 158 minutes of it (or even 162 if you have the director's cut), it is a rewarding experience. Fincher and the cast have clearly been snubbed of Oscars for this film.",10,1,3,1 September 2008
Incendies," Our Love Became a Funeral Pyre
","When people watch the Oscars, they don't usually care about the Best Foreign Film nominees. Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays in the viewer's mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film's story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York, at which I saw this last night, Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn't have a great future ahead of them.Based on the play Scorched by Wajdi Mouawad, Incendies follows a non-linear plot that spans two generations. In the present day, Jeanne and Simon are twins who have lost their mother, Nawal. Nawal has stipulated in her will that Jeanne and Simon must return an envelope to the brother they didn't know existed who is currently living in a fictional Middle Eastern country. Only then can the twins give Nawal a proper burial. Jeanne feels obligated to return the letter, so she goes to the Middle East, only to realize some of Nawal's nastiest secrets. As Jeanne uncovers more about Nawal, the viewer is shown Nawal's story. The film builds up to an unforgettable ending that is sure to rock any viewer.Incendies already had great source material. I've praised the plot enough, but one thing I must add is that the play is apparently four hours long, according to Villeneuve. It's impressive that this movie succeeds so nicely because I can't imagine that anything was cut. But to back up that source material, there's some really great acting. The entire cast plays their parts with such an emotional vigor that it seems impossible that this work of art wasn't autobiographical.Furthermore, Villeneuve has made a film that relies on great filmmaking to impact the viewer. The cinematography is beautifully bland, surely a nod to some of the deserts in the Lebanon- like land where the movie takes place. Color scheme is also used to Villeneuve's advantage to show the parallels between Nawal and Jeanne's lives. Villeneuve seems to love working with extended zoom shots that shock the viewer with their overwhelmingly long silences. Why Villeneuve didn't receive critical acclaim (in America, at least) before Incendies is a mystery.There are many movies about the Middle East. Some have failed miserably in their attempts to strike an emotional chord with critics and viewers alike (Redacted, Rendition), but others have been extremely successful (The Hurt Locker, Lebanon). Incendies could very well be one of the best films ever made about the conflicts in the Middle East. It has its flaws which keep it from being a masterpiece (maybe it could've lost five or ten minutes), but it is that rare type of film that really resonates beyond the initial viewing. Hopefully, Incendies will be remembered for years to come as the little, brilliant film that spawned the great fame of Denis Villeneuve.",9,190,222,26 March 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," We Grew Old Together
","In the beginning of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, the viewer is immediately introduced to the dark nature of the film. Hermione puts her parents under a spell that makes them forget she ever lived ('Obliviate!'). The Minister of Magic warns that Voldemort has returned. A teacher from Hogwarts hovers over a table, only to be dropped to her death by Snape ('Cruciatus!'). And so we begin the dark final chapter of Harry Potter, and quite possibly one of the better ones, too.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), who is now seventeen years old, has dropped out of Hogwarts. Instead of learning spells for his last year, he will be hunting down the Voldemort's seven horcruxes, or the pieces of Voldemort's soul. When he finds all of them, he will destroy them and end Voldemort for good. But the trials that await him were enough for the writer of this film to split it into two parts, a decision that was probably for the better. Part 1 of the final installment follows Harry and his friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), in his fateful journey. In this odd twist on the road movie, the characters learn about the histories of the wizarding world as well as a few things about themselves.The style of the sixth Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, has carried over into this film. The visuals are even colder in this one, with a greater amount of grays, blacks, and whites. Cinematography is not the only thing David Yates, the director, relies on to keep the film moody and disturbing. Steven Kloves, the writer of the film, has chosen to keep J.K. Rowling's disquieting atmosphere by removing all humor found in the other films. His simplified version of the story has not left out the least kid-friendly sequences in the movie, these being the violent ones. Over the course of the movie, we only begin to see characters die; there are many more to come in the morbid second half.While the movie is never uplifting, it is impossible not to be spellbound by some of the haunting sequences, most notably a brief but intense torture scene towards the end. The animated 'Three Brothers' story is easily one of the best scenes in the entire Harry Potter series. Much like the anime sequence in Kill Bill: Vol. 1, it is rather risky but successful animated piece of the film. The action scenes in this one are also very well done, and possibly choreographed better than those of the other films. In Deathly Hallows: Part 1, the parts with action (although there are only a few, unfortunately) are snappy, suspenseful, and quick. Never once is it tiring to hear another 'Expeliarmus!' shouted by Harry.What is tiring, however, is the pacing in Deathly Hallows. Although Part 1 is obviously a build-up for the epically long battle of Part 2, the viewer may grow a little tired during the second act, a part of the movie that is mostly about slowing down the story to look at the psychological effects of the past seven years on the main characters. It is interesting, however, to see the strings of Ron, Harry, and Hermione's relationship coming undone. And were it not for strong character actors like Watson, Radcliffe, and Grint, the middle third may not have held up. Most of the movie plays like a taut political thriller, full of muggle intrigue and corruption, but sometimes it may movie a little fast for young viewers, although this is not necessarily a film to bring the young ones to see.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 presents some very good performances, realistic special effects, and complicated story arcs, some of which are compromised by a free-form plot structure. With the cliffhanger ending of Part 1, we move one film closer to leaving behind the beloved trio that Rowling started twelve years, an event that will be tearful for fans of all ages. Part 1 is the calm before the storm. And now for the storm...",8,0,1,21 November 2010
Knowing," If it's one thing I know, it's that I hate this movie
","Knowing is an interesting movie to discuss. It's the kind of movie where it's very good...until the end. I'll save the end for later in this review, but let me just say that the ending SUCKS. The beginning and middle are a taut, yet flawed piece of cinema, however the end is so unbelievably far fetched and stupid that it ruins the rest of the movie.The movie is another end of the world movie, but this time, it's not by Ronald Emmerich. Nicolas Cage plays a drunk whose son one day brings home a sheet with numbers written on it from a time capsule. After carefully analyzing the numbers, he finds out that they predict dates that people will die and how many people will die on that day. Things don't exactly run swimmingly for him when he realizes the list runs out which means the inevitable: the end of the world! Intriguing, no? Well, not quite.Though the beginning and middle are actually quite good and interesting, the movie is very clichéd. Just about every sci-fi/horror cliché you could think of is in this. Things like the dark man lurking in the woods, the jump scene, and the ominous music are all seen here. On top of this, the acting is just awful. Nicolas Cage's acting teacher from college must be crying over how bad his performance is. Rose Byrne gives her usual, extremely boring performance. There is one thing I will praise: the special effects. I don't know how much went into special effects for this movie, but they are fantastic. I've never seen such good special effects in a movie before. It should win the Oscar for Special Effects.Now for the ending. No, I didn't find the ending offensive although many Christians might. It's not The Da Vinci Code, but there are some pretty heavy anti-Christianity themes in it. The ending is completely far fetched. The ending includes Christianity, aliens, solar flares, and pebbles. You try picking up the pieces. You'll never guess how stupid the ending in when you finally see it. I won't say much more than that if anyone does decide to see it, however, I would recommend you rent another DVD. This one's not worth it.",3,0,1,2 September 2009
Salt," Lacking Logic, but Filled with Cool Action
","It may have been a long Cold War, but Angelina Jolie is definitely quite hot. In Salt, Jolie does quite a bit of ass-kicking and also manages to give a good performance. Unfortunately, Jolie is unable to completely save Salt, which falls victim to the classic mistake of poor writing in the third act. Though it makes so little sense that it probably lowers one's IQ in the concise 99 minutes that it runs for, Salt makes for an enjoyable ride until the multi-twist finale that runs unnecessarily long.Salt is named after the title heroine, Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie). Evelyn is happily married to her husband and enjoys a somewhat normal life as a CIA agent. And then one day she has a really bad day, one that rivals those that Jack Bauer manages to survive in '24.' In an interrogation session, a Russian spy reveals a plot to assassinate the Russian Prime Minister, which is a part of an even larger plot to destroy the United States called 'Day X.' He also reveals that Evelyn is a Russian spy. Even though she claims this to be false, Evelyn stupidly decides to go on the run and murders quite a few people in the process. But is Evelyn really the person she seems to be? A great supporting cast includes Chiwetel Ejiofor and Liev Schreiber.Angelina Jolie is responsible for many of the reasons why parts of this film are successful. Salt was originally named for Edwin A. Salt and Tom Cruise was set to play him. After reading the script, Tom Cruise felt his character was too similar to Ethan Hunt, his other character from Mission: Impossible, and detached himself from the film. And it is a great thing that he did. Jolie plays her role with so much intensity and mystique, something that women in action films can rarely pull off. At her best, Jolie acts with ferocity and sexuality, and that is just what she does in Salt's slick action sequences.Unfortunately for Jolie, the story often falls flat. Although most action films (with the exception of movies like The Dark Knight and Inception) are not meant for people who are extremely smart, movies should still have a coherent and linear plot. Salt certainly lacks an understandable plot and, to make it worse, has absolutely no logic. The motivations are never clear for any character in the entire film and the plot twists around three too many times. It is obvious that Phillip Noyce, the director of two James Patterson adaptations, can stage a nice action sequence, but there has to be a stable plot to support a scene. Most of the time, Kurt Wimmer's mediocre script cannot support the intense action that unfolds on-screen. The last half hour of the film is so outlandish and unnecessary that it almost loses any respect from some audience members. Many viewers might not react positively to an ending that does not completely satisfy. (Note: A rumor is going around that a sequel is on its way.) At times, Salt is exactly what is should be: a nice diversion. But at other times, it is so extremely nonsensical that it proves detrimental to the movie's overall effect. Angelina Jolie does her best as Evelyn Salt and almost always succeeds in surprising the audience, but a so-so script sometimes weighs her performance down. Salt mainly suffers when its story begins to unravel in the final half hour. The ending, unfortunately, lacks a punch, but the first hour is still good enough to keep the viewer high on an adrenaline rush throughout the entire movie. Even though Salt is not nearly as good as it should have been, it still remains an enjoyable experience.",7,3,6,14 August 2010
District 9," A Poignant, Riveting Film Packed with Action
","District 9 is by far one of the best films of the summer. It's not the best, but it's in my top three for the summer. As many reviews have already said, it's one of the best sci-fi films in years. Not only does it constantly have your heart racing for the whole movie, but it also provokes a lot of thinking and great discussion afterwards. Unlike many alien movies, it makes you think.If you haven't already seen the short entitled 'Alive in Joburg', which is also by Hollywood's new hottest director Neil Blomkamp, then you may not know what to expect. The complicated plot is about aliens that have landed in Johannesburg 28 years ago (it takes place in 2010) and have become a nuisance to the people who live there. They are forced to live in ghettos where there are constant riots from humans and frequent acts of crime. One day, a company decides that they will get rid of the aliens by evicting them from their homes. Wikus van der Merwes (Sharlto Copley) heads the operation and contracts an odd virus from one of their weapons. What happens next is unforgettable and unusual. By the way, it may sound like I'm saying a lot, but all this happens in the first 30 minutes. Yeah, it's complicated.District 9 is not a film to see for fun. It actually is disturbing and leaves you feeling quite numb afterwards. That being said, it also is a social commentary on Apartheid and other genocides currently going on in Africa right now. The real power of this film lies in its ability to use the aliens as a metaphor for Apartheid. The film manages to make us hate the aliens without even seeing them for very long. It's amazing to see how quickly humans can become prejudiced.Aside from this, there is a lot of action. I was not expecting this when I walked into the theater, however the action sequences are riveting. Also, the way the story is told is smart. It's told as though it's a documentary infusing interviews throughout the movie. As you may have noticed even from watching the trailer, the film's special effects are unbelievable. The aliens flawlessly fit in with the humans in awesome and somewhat ironic manner. To think this film only cost $30 million is mind blowing.It's not very hard to figure out what all the buzz for District 9 was about. It's smart and at the same time very entertaining. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but those who are fans of sci-fi will definitely be pleased. Knowing what to expect before you see ruins the impact a little so don't read to much online about it, but I would definitely advise people to see it.",10,2,5,6 September 2009
Bridesmaids," Having the Wedding Cake and Eating it Too. It's a Women's World, After All.
","Maybe gross-out comedy and chick flicks aren't usually connected, but that should all change with Paul Feig's Bridesmaids. The Judd Apatow-backed comedy boldly bucks that trend by carefully balancing emotional elements and hilarious jokes. What many comedies are incapable of doing these days is getting dramatic points across while simultaneously making the audience laugh. And that is just where Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig's screenplay succeeds so brilliantly. There is, of course, a brilliant group of actresses that puts her writing to work as well. This cliché-busting doesn't last the entire movie, however--it regresses into typical romantic comedy territory in the final third--but no matter, Bridesmaids is one of the only funny comedies in recent memory.Bridesmaids' wonderful central character is Annie, played by Kristen Wiig. Annie's life hasn't been every woman's dream. Her venture as a baker has failed completely, she can't afford her rent, she has occasional sexual romps with a man (Jon Hamm) who refuses to be her boyfriend, and she simply has no friends. Even worse is the fact that her best friend (Maya Rudolph) is getting married and has asked her to be the maid of honor. And to complete it all, she has to deal with a troop of other women helping with the wedding. The ensemble cast is rounded out by Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McLoven-Corey, and Ellie Kemper.But just why does Bridesmaids rise above other female-driven rom-coms? The simple answer is Kristen Wiig. Her writing breathes life into normally one-dimensional misguided women. The more complicated answer is all of the actresses' ability to make each character seem normal. More often than not, women with waists the size of toothpicks prance across the screen in search of a male counterpart that they hoped to marry. This is not the case with the women of Bridesmaids. Those who have married or placed themselves in other traditional roles have found themselves to be stuck in harmful situations. Characters like Annie who haven't still have their own problems. It's not easy being a woman, apparently (please note that I'm male), and Bridesmaids certainly glorifies living the life of a 'real' woman who actually faces problems.Bridesmaids was nicknamed 'the female Hangover' when the trailer came out. That's not a horrible comparison at times, but most often, Bridesmaids is an original movie. None of the jokes are borrowed and while some of the characters feel like Apatow archetypes now, each woman seems new and enriched. Even the method in which punchlines are told is original. There are two sequences, one on a plane involving a drugged out Annie stumbling through first class and one in a fitting shop involving food poisoning and a white dress, in particular that are notable for being especially hilarious. The delivery is important: in both scenes, five jokes come together in one big punchline that caused the audience to roar with laughter. It's a grand but all too normal affair and it works for almost all of the movie.If Bridesmaids is the future of comedy, I look forward to going to the movies more often. Women are just as hilarious as men. It's a simple fact of life that writers often ignore. And all it took was Mumolo and Wiig to show us this. Equally emotional and sexual, Bridesmaids is a smart comedy that only comes once a year. Say 'I do' to Bridesmaids. It's $11 that's actually worth spending at the movies.",8,4,10,17 May 2011
Insidious," Insidious is Truly Insidious
","How many horror movies are actually scary? Three, maybe four? Make that five. Insidious just made the list.James Wan's Insidious is unusual in every sense of the word. It's a 100-minute thrill ride that is a homage to countless horror movies, including Poltergeist and The Shining, and often enough, Insidious succeeds in bringing the scares. Terrifying and entertaining, Insidious threatens its viewer with an insulting amount of jump scares, however it does not matter when the result is this good. Popcorn entertainment may not be this fun again for a while.Insidious' plot may sound contrived, and that's because it is. Leigh Whanell's original script borrows a lot of previous horror greats. Renai (Rose Byrne) and Josh Lambert (Patrick Wilson) are a married couple with three children that have just moved into a new house. Yet not everything is perfect. The protagonists' marriage is tense and cold and there's something deeply unsettling about their home. It isn't long before one of their sons, Dalton, falls from a ladder while he is investigating a noise in the attic and becomes comatose. The house isn't done with the Lamberts yet. And the filmmakers aren't done with us either.Wan shows a clear sense of maturity with Insidious. That is to say that he has stepped it up from the bloody albeit twisty Saw and the boring Dead Silence. Insidious alludes to past horror masterpieces frequently, and after all, isn't copying the sincerest form of flattery? Wan uses all this to his advantage--Insidious becomes creaky, slow carnival ride that never lets up. Wan has clearly learned from the masters; now he's just showing off.As if Insidious' atmospheric tone wasn't enough, Wan has made Insidious a textbook example of horror done right. Lighting is used to create intrigue and mystery; the camera whirls and shakes to give the film an unsettling dissonance. Often Insidious verges on corny, but this is all with good intent. Violins certainly hit the high notes to give the viewer chills.But Insidious is far from perfect. In fact, Wan's film is still marred by many flaws, notably a tonal change about halfway through that nearly wrecks any momentum gained in the quiet first act. It also seems that every two minutes there is a jump scene. This is a something that works at first, but by the end of it, it gets to be a bit much. And while there is some much needed comic relief in some of the scariest parts, it doesn't quite hang together when jokes are made. Furthermore, some elements of the plot are nonsensical, yet all this can be missed when disbelief is suspended.In 2009, Paranormal Activity was hailed as one of the scariest movies ever. It's time for Insidious to get the recognition it deserves. Insidious may not be everyone's type of horror movie, but it's an intelligent, scary, and well-made film designed for people who actually care about watching movies. Although Insidious may take itself way too seriously, it's hard to ignore a film that is so intensely scary as this. There's one scene where Lorraine, played by Barbra Hershey, says, 'I had a dream last night. I was in the house. I was very afraid.' Aren't we all, darling.",9,7,13,17 April 2011
Clash of the Titans," Forget the Titans
","Ray Harryhausen would have been rolling in his grave. The special effects in the update of Clash of the Titans are entirely done by computer. Quite obviously, a lot has changed since the 1981 version, some for the better but most for the worse. The new Clash of the Titans is enjoyable at times, but most of the time, it is boring and tiresome. Some of the action sequences are cool, but these sequences cannot make one forget the horrible acting and silly script.The remake of Clash of the Titans follows a similar plot to the original. In ancient Greece, the people have turned against the gods. Zeus (Liam Neeson) is extremely mad and decides to punish the people of Greece. When Zeus vows to kill Andromeda, the beautiful princess, the people assemble a group of warriors to fight back before Andromeda dies. Perseus (Sam Worthington), a demigod who also happens to be the son of Zeus, is chosen as one of these warriors.The movie's uneven pacing is responsible for why it is so boring sometimes. The movie trudges along for the first 45 minutes, in which barely anything happens. But after it is done being slow and eventless, the plot ends up moving too fast, skipping most of the good parts. The action sequences are, for the most, part slick and fun to watch, but unfortunately, there are only three of them. All of this can be attributed to a bad script that makes no sense and forces the actors to spew sentences that sound strange and unbelievable. On top of all this, the acting is terrible, which makes the delivery of these lines even harder to like. Sam Worthington's dull acting lends no help to the movie's problems or the audience's interest. But an acceptable performance from Liam Neeson is not horrible to watch.The film's other main problem is that it takes itself way too seriously. The old 80's version felt hokey and fun, while this one wants to be good so desperately that it constantly trips over its own feet. At least the old film has not been completely forgotten. Fans of the old version will be pleased to see Bubo, the mechanical owl, making a brief appearance. Louis Leterrier's clever placement of allusions to the 80's version let me appreciate the film a little more because it showed that the film was not only a remake, but a homage at heart. Still, the older version remains far superior.3-D cannot save this film. Clash of the Titans is somewhat fun, but mostly forgettable due to a poor script, B-movie style acting, and a lack of action. Although Leterrier has left a few hints that he still cares about the original, the movie is too serious and not hokey enough. Even with 3-D, the film still feels dimensionless and contrived most of the time.",6,1,1,21 August 2010
Paranormal Activity," One of the scariest films ever!
","Fear. One of the most essential and loved emotions ever in the movies. Does Paranormal Activity bring the fear? It sure does. Paranormal Activity is one of the rare horror movies that is actually scary and that makes you afraid to sleep. Many horror movies these days fall the way of Sorority Row and the Final Destination series-full of clichés and lacking scary material. In fact, in a day where the horror movie is not actually scary, it is hard to even call it a genre anymore. Paranormal Activity disobeys the standards for the new horror movie genre and brings the old version back with good film-making and great thrills.This spooky little film starts out easy and almost a comedy. It's about a couple, Katie and Micah (pronounced Meeka), who have been experiencing what they think is a haunting. The two quarrel while remaining hopelessly in love with each other. Micah decides to set up a camera system to appease Katie who is hoping to give Micah a glimpse of a ghost which she believes to be in the house. The heart of the film is its night scenes which depict the couple sleeping in bed while the ghost (it's actually something slightly different) 'attacks'. The film is made in the 'shaky cam' style, but the camera is not very shaky and audiences concerned about nausea should not be.Paranormal Activity works primarily for the reason that it continually mounts fear. As I said before, the beginning starts out comedy-like, gradually transitions into horror, and then just goes wild. The night scenes are scariest because they prey on one of our most common fears: the unknown predator. The viewer knows what it is that is haunting them, yet they never get even a quick look at what it is that is doing this other than its shadow. The night scenes begin with shutting doors, banging noises, and booming noises in the background. This may not sound like anything new, but after this phase is done, the film just keeps getting stranger. By the end, the film is so scary that the viewer just hopes that there isn't another night scene coming, that everything is going to be okay, that the movie will be over so they won't have to endure any more fear. No, Oren Peli, the director, does not give up. Once you've gotten into his trap of this movie, you can't leave. Peli has made a film so scary that even I, a person who really doesn't get scared by horror movies, might have trouble sleeping for the next few days.This film is absolutely one to catch in theaters. Part of the fun of the movie seeing the audience's reaction. The film was so scary that during a screening in Montreal, a person fainted and was carted out of the theater by the ambulance. Alright, nothing that exciting happened to me, but yes, the reactions were very interesting. However, it was so scary that one woman sitting behind me kept murmuring to herself 'Ohmygod, ohmygod, ohmygod!' during the night scenes. Later, the 'ohmygods' turned into a scream which, at the very end, changed into her crying because she was so scared. Many people didn't have as intense a reaction as this, but almost everyone was gasping when scary things happened. I even found myself gasping at the screen at certain parts, something I have never found myself doing before at a movie.It's hard to believe that Paranormal Activity was made for $11,000. It brings the scares of a $20 million-ish movie. Oren Peli takes the audience and scares them until the very end which is easily one of the most jolting endings to a movie ever. Don't watch the trailers! They spoil the ending! Anyway, Paranormal Activity is one of the scariest movies ever and will definitely spook any horror fan. It's a must see for people who care about movies and even for people just looking for fun. I know that I've never had as much fun watching a movie in theaters before. Paranormal Activity is not only one of the best films of the year, but also one of the most frightening films of all time.",10,2,9,17 October 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Uneven but Wonderful Burtonian Fare
","It was difficult for me to decide upon a rating for this. After hotly anticipating Alice in Wonderland since July of 2009 when the first trailer came out, March 5th of 2010 finally came and I got to see it. Alice in Wonderland is quite different than most of the other editions of the Alice story and also one of the better ones, yet it is far from perfect. One might expect more from Burton, but all in all the film is satisfying. The 3-D is not quite as good as the 3-D in other films, but it is still quite nice. The film is mostly held up by strong performances and good art design, but brought down by an incredibly uneven script. It was difficult, but I finally arrived at the decision that Alice is in fact a good movie.Alice in Wonderland has been changed slightly for this edition. The film is a semi-sequel to Alice in Wonderland with a few elements of Through the Looking Glass incorporated. The story follows Alice Kingsley, beautifully played by Mia Wasikowska (try pronouncing that one correctly!), after she has been proposed to by a man she is not in love with. Alice is nineteen here and is now returning to Wonderland...make that Underland. In Underland she meets the usual cast of characters including the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), the Cheshire Cat, Absalom/the Caterpillar (Alan Rickman), Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb, and the Jabberwocky. A few new characters even join the now familiar crew.As I mentioned before, the film's quality is sustained by good performances and an excellent art department combined with special effects. Mia Wasikowska, who you may recognize as Sophie from In Treatment (probably not though), gives another great performance. Can someone explain why this is not household name yet? I surprisingly enjoyed Johnny Depp's performance very much as well. Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway act nicely as well. And now for the art department. The sets, which there are very few because most everything is CGI, are quite nice. The costume design is elaborate and accurate for the time period.Now let's talk about what was just so-so in the movie. The script is definitely what has caused some people to hate this movie. At the beginning, the script is very weak and slow moving, but eventually it speeds up. Unfortunately, it takes about an hour to do so. Also, Tim Burton does the exact same thing he does every time: dark, Hot Topic-esquire film-making. I'm sorry, but since when has doing the same thing every time meant being a great director? The film includes his favorite actors in pretty much the same parts. Isn't the Mad Hatter just a bit too similar to Willy Wonka? Of course, what Tim Burton does is enjoyable, but isn't it all a little too much already? Alice in Wonderland is not an easy film to explain. It's both great and so-so. Tim Burton has definitely put his magic touch on certain parts and the actors try very hard, but the film lacks a consistent script. I want to like it more, but I just can't. The 3-D provides some physical depth to the movie, but the movie lacks metaphorical depth.",7,2,11,5 March 2010
Super 8," Eight Reasons to See Super 8 (and Two Reasons Why Not)
","Instead of presenting this as a normal review, I'll put it in the form of bullets. I just think it's more reader-friendly for this. It also helps to avoid plot details, and that's probably better if you want to go in with a blank slate.1. If you like Steven Spielberg, you'll like this movie. J.J. Abrams has clearly created the movie as a homage to the classics that Spielberg has made. Echoes of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Jurassic Park are felt throughout the entire film. Super 8 directly borrows Jaws' style in that the viewer only gets brief glimpses at the monster for the first two thirds; it isn't until the last third that the viewer sees it in its entirety.2. The acting. Elle Fanning is the highlight of a great cast of child actors. Fanning has proved herself once with Somewhere, but she ups the ante with Super 8. There's one great scene where she has to act as though she's acting in a movie filmed by the other children. She, along with the rest of them, nails it.3. J.J. Abrams' script. The writing is one of the best things about Super 8. It's rich, fast, and, again, Spielbergian. Abrams' screenplay is delightful because it plays on the viewer's own childhood memories. It's basically one long nostalgia trip.4. J.J. Abrams' direction. He basically becomes Steven Spielberg to make this movie, as seen in his use of constant Steadicam shots and visual restraint when it comes to the shots of the monster in the early parts of the movie.5. The cinematography and color palette. Also reminiscent of 1970s blockbuster film is the visual look of the movie. The drowned-out colors are similar to that of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.6. The train sequence. The best scene in the movie is one involving a train crash. It's basically what you've already seen from the first trailer, but this time, it's from a different point-of-view. Watch this in a big theater. You're going to want to hear how great the sound editing is in this scene.7. The monster. I'm not going to say anything other than that I very much enjoyed the way the monster looked.8. The tone. Like The Goonies, Super 8 is a summer movie that's made to make you feel like a kid again. It's wonderful, at times whimsical and at other times frightening. It's exactly what one should want from a summer movie, but...Reasons why not to see Super 8: 1. J.J. Abrams got too bogged down in becoming Steven Spielberg. The film is sometimes obnoxious in how much it wants to be Jaws. This ends up getting in the way of the film's great story, and keeps it from becoming a classic.2. It's not perfect. Super 8 has pacing issues a lot of the time and will often involve characters and subplots that completely unnecessary. There are certain elements of the movie that could have absolutely been taken away without any repercussions.Overall, Super 8 is worth seeing. Take the family out and have fun. See it in a big theater with a good sound system. It's a fun but unfortunately forgettable ride.",8,5,10,11 June 2011
Inception," Christopher Nolan's Newest Dream is Far From a Nightmare
","How could Christopher Nolan possibly follow up The Dark Knight, one of the most important movies of the past decade? The answer to that would be Inception. It was an ambitious task to take on and Nolan proves that the only man for this task was himself. In one of the most unusual and complicated movies ever made, Nolan succeeds in thrilling the viewer while holding the viewer in a vise, never once letting a person's eyes leave the beautiful, dreamy images displayed on the screen. Though Nolan proved himself a master of cinema three times with Memento, The Dark Knight, and The Prestige, he has once again provided regular movie-goers and film buffs alike with a movie that will be remembered for decades to come as a classic.Summarizing Inception is not quite as easy as it seems. From the very beginning, the viewer is dropped into Nolan's imaginative dream world in which Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, the Extractor. The Extractor's job is to perform inception, that is, plant information in someone's mind via his dreams. And this is exactly the job that Cobb is trying to perform in the beginning when he is double crossed by Saito (Ken Watanabe). Saito then asks Cobb to aide him in getting a business rival named Fischer (Cillian Murphy) to disband Fischer's father's empire. Cobb takes the job and assembles a team to help him perform the inception including Ariadne(Ellen Page), who takes a job as an Architect, the person who designs the dream worlds. Cobb's job is made difficult by Mal (Marion Cotillard), his dead wife who is now reappearing in dreams and wreaking havoc for Cobb. Other cast includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Caine.As one can see from my 'brief' summary, the film is extremely complicated. But this is far from accidental on Nolan's part. Dreams are commonly blurred with reality, making it hard for the viewer to distinguish what is real and what is dreamed. After all, Cobb does say that 'Dreams feel real when we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize that something was actually strange.' As the characters delve further into the visually stimulating dream world, the plot becomes even harder to follow, but not necessarily in a bad way. The film culminates in five plots occurring simultaneously for about an hour of the film. Yet the viewer stays interested in the film. Nolan had me thoroughly engrossed for the entire two and a half hours that the movie lasted.But the film's beauty lies not in its impressive cast or original plot, but rather in its rich technical work. The special effects in this film are very realistic and certainly fun to watch. When Ariadne is first introduced to the dream world, Cobb proves that the world she is currently in is a dream by letting Paris explode. The scene is useless to the plot, but it does not matter for the sole reason that it is gorgeous. In another scene, two characters fight in a hallway that has no gravity. The scene is thrilling, but what is most interesting is that it looks so real. The film's cinematography is equally arresting. Nolan uses slow motion multiple times throughout the movie, each of which involves water. The slow motion is completely unnecessary, but it is unbelievably beautiful, so it really does not matter that it is presented to us for no apparent reason.Forget the acting. Forget the special effects. Forget the plot. Inception boils down to Christopher Nolan. Nolan is the reason why the film works, why it is so visually arresting, why it succeeds in making a viewer think hours after watch it. For a year in which very few great movies have come out, Nolan's Inception sticks out because it is original--it is an idea that is entirely new, and for that reason alone, it should be highly commended. But Nolan has superseded this. Inception rises to a new level because it has great acting, a twisted web of a plot, and ornate special effects. It may not be better than some of Nolan's previous work, but it sure is great. This is the stuff dreams are made of.",10,7,15,17 July 2010
Win Win," Raging Calf
","We all saw The Kids are All Right. Many of us enjoyed it and helped it to become a success. What we all haven't seen is Win Win, which is truly unfortunate because it is a more honest though not necessarily better family dramedy than The Kids are All Right. Thomas McCarthy, the writer-director of Win Win, shows one of the best recent examples of realism with his oddly charming screenplay and rich characters. Often enough, quiet movies like this one go unnoticed. I strongly urge people to go see this and not let that happen.Win Win's plot sounds too complicated for a light comedy. Mike Flaherty (played with tenderness by Paul Giamatti) is happily married to his wife (Amy Ryan) and has two children. This all sounds nice, but his New Jersey law practice is failing. On the verge of losing everything, Mike decides to take a $1,500 monthly commission by becoming the guardian of a client that was recently put into a senior citizen home. As Mike is moving his client's belongings to the home, he meets Kyle (Alex Shaffer in his debut performance), his client's grandson. Kyle has run away from his mother, a drug addict living in Ohio. Mike takes Kyle in and finds that he has a talent for wrestling. As Kyle becomes a bigger part of the family, the Flahertys come closer together and find that they love Kyle.Win Win boasts a great cast full of well-known Oscar nominees, semi-well-known actors, and complete unknowns. Paul Giamatti is, as usual, a treat to watch as he completely transforms himself into his part. But the real standouts are Amy Ryan, Alex Shaffer, and most importantly Bobby Cannavale. Ryan's supporting performance feels honest and endearing. Shaffer's performance sometimes feel forced, however this is all in character. Shaffer is an actor to watch; we'll see more of him. It is Bobby Cannavale who steals the show as Terry, Mike's divorced and klutzy friend. Cannavale's role demands an actor who can give a fun and sad performance all at once--Cannavale nails it.Thomas McCarthy as director has done a satisfactory job. Where the great in this film really lies is his extraordinarily ordinary screenplay. In terms of other realistic dramas, we need look no further than Breathless to see what McCarthy has done so right. Jean Luc-Godard immortalized the naive beauty of a regular couple living during the 60's in France. McCarthy has so beautifully humanized an extremely normal family living in America during the recession. Win Win is not particularly well made per se, but does it really need to be when there's such a great screenplay?Win Win is an actor's film above all else. And yet its story is somehow uplifting and compelling at the same time. The same film could not have come out of another cast or writer. It's a shame this was released in March because it is sure to be overlooked by the Oscars in 2012. Win Win is not a memorable film, but for now, it is a wonderful, small, and quiet film that deserves praise and love from everyone.",8,1,3,27 March 2011
Amélie," A beautifully quirky comedy
","Amelie is a splendid movie. It is truly a feel good movie that will charm anyone who watches it. The quirky tale is about a woman who sees unhappy people in her life. She tries to enrich the lives of those seven people to make them as happy as her own. When Amelie finds a man that she loves, she is unsure what to do and is completely clueless. Amelie is a great movie because of its odd sense of humor. The humor is very quirky (to those who have already seen it: the orgasm scene). The humor is somewhat similar to the American TV show 'Pushing Daisies'. Amelie should be able to charm any person and will suck them in within the first fifteen minutes of the movie. It is a film that makes you want to go out and make other people as happy as you felt when you were watching it.",10,1,4,16 February 2008
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," What My Childhood Died For
","I remember when I was five years old. I remember my mother reading Harry Potter to me, the way her hands turned the pages, the way she placed her bookmark in the book when she thought I had fallen asleep. I remember wanting to be Harry Potter. I was Harry Potter twice for Halloween, as a matter of fact, wandless and only armed with jack-o-lantern shaped box for keeping candy. And now, almost at age 18, I have created a new memory of my own, that of sitting next to my mother, and now my brother, in a dark theater, sobbing together at the thought that it really is the end of my favorite series, Harry Potter.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is the near-perfect finale to one of the most beloved series ever written. David Yates has created the first, and unfortunately only, classic of the Harry Potter film series in a spectacular and emotional thrill ride. Dark, brooding, and downright suspenseful, Harry Potter ends with an enormous bang, one whose reverberations will be felt for years to come.The bang that this movie creates only begins with its fine actors. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have matured into real adult actors now. Once cute and dopey, the trio has now become truly magical at their profession. Though it's a spectacle to watch the chemistry between our three leads, they're overshadowed by an impossibly large supporting cast. Maggie Smith returns to give a sweet performance. Ralph Fiennes reprises his role as Voldemort and totally creeps us out. The real star of the show is, however, Alan Rickman. Finally, Rickman emerges from the depths of the great sets and shows his true acting chops as Snape. He's just fantastic to watch.And the film is technically brilliant as well. The visual effects go heavy on the pyrotechnics, so why not throw in a little slow-motion while we're at it? And so David Yates does, but whereas most directors (other than Zack Snyder, that is) can't handle slow-motion, Yates does it perfectly. It's thrilling, and it's only aided by Eduardo Serra's cinematography. He's an expert at what he does: Serra loves playing with color, and it totally works in every way. Sometimes, the film is so drab looking that it almost becomes black-and-white. What Serra films is gorgeous. He's secured himself a nomination for Best Cinematography.The film isn't without its flaws however. Steve Kloves' script is lacking as usual, placing far too much emphasis on action and not enough on the characters themselves. Humor is used improperly to lighten the otherwise moody atmosphere. That said, the way Kloves writes action, and the way Yates directs it, is marvelous.While it can't help but feel as though there's a full half hour missing from the final cut, Yates and his team have made a brilliant film. I almost feel weird saying that a Harry Potter film is great. Mainstream films just shouldn't be this good, but thankfully, they still can be. Movie magic still does exist after all.Unfortunately, no matter how many times we see these characters when we watch the movies or read the books again, they'll never be fully resurrected. It's the first time that matters the most. After that, it's never the same. Everything ends, unfortunately, and so does the Harry Potter series. I have grown so much with Harry Potter, but it's finally time to lay it to rest. Goodbye, Harry and crew. You'll be sorely missed.",10,1,3,16 July 2011
