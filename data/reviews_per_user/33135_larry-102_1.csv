Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Episode One and the Ignorance of Unattainable Expectations
","I agree with what Kevin Smith, of Clerks, Chasing Amy and, MallRats, said about the movie:I'm sure in about a week, it's going to become quite fashionable to bash this flick - hard. But I'd like to go on record as saying I dug it. It's a good movie with great moments.That was a week ago........hmmmmm...lots of people bashing now. The movie  was great.  The little kid was an incredible actor.....for his age. There weren't 'special effects' as far as that goes. It was the movie...I didn't sit around thinking about how great the Effects were, I just sat and watched the movie.  They were flawlessly integrated. Except in 2 parts:) When the Naboo Ship lands upon Tatooine...the dust was obviously computerized. When Anakin's pod racer is fired up for the first time....same complaint. I have seen several complaints that Darth Maul was a wimp. Darth Maul a wimp? hmmmm.....He seemed to kick the s*** out of a bad ass Jedi.....actually.....he pretty much was whuppin' ass on 2 for a good long while there.... I personally think that people who didn't like the movie bought into hype and had expectations that were not attainable.  Others of us had the sense to go in with attainable expectations:)",10,0,0,20 May 1999
