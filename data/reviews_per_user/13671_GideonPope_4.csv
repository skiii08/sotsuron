Blade Runner 2049," Shortest 2.5+ hour movie I have ever seen . . . but not quite great.
","I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. I'd have really preferred to give it a 6.5 out of ten. The 2 hours and 44 minutes went by fairly quickly, which is to say that I was being entertained. Usually when a movie gets to be very long, it's trying to make up for in volume what it lacks in substance (think A.I. and Benjamin Button - both awful AND long). This movie, however, filled the 2.5 hours plus with enjoyable content. That written, it could have, and maybe should have, been shorter. SPOILERS There were several scenes with the lead character interacting with a computer image/hologram of a woman. I recognize that that was important to building sympathy/empathy for the character,but it really didn't work to that effect for me. Regarding the plot, it seemed a bit scattered. Was tough at times to follow who was trying to do what and for what reason. I don't usually like plot dumps, where a character spells out exactly what is going on, but I could have used one or two in this film. I really can't say much more other than it was fairly forgettable and not particularly fantastic. Just kind of ambled along. Not even in the same galaxy as the original. Also, there are not going to be flying cars in 31 years.",7,3,9,8 October 2017
Wind River," Did not like this movie at all - slow, predictable, and unlikely
","3 is as generous as I can get on this review.I think most people, like me, wanted to like this movie because it involves A) violence against women, and B) a depiction of Native American hardship. By liking the movie, you indirectly show your support for the causes, as it were.The movie was just not good. It started well enough, and I was not dissuaded by the slow pace.Wheels fell off when - SPOILERS AFTER HERE - Jane shoots the young man in the trailer. Totally unnecessary scene, and totally unrealistic. Ask yourself this - what are the odds that a cop investigating a murder ends up in a trailer with a guy who has done nothing wrong, but yet opens fire on the cop and ends up getting shot? How about close to zero? So now with the wheels off a fire breaks out to burn the remaining structure down when there is a Mexican stand off (no slight intended - I don't believe that's pejorative) among 10 different people - Jane, the Tribal cop, two Star-Trek-Orange-Suit guys they bring along, and 5 or 6 of the drilling crew guys, all of whom are armed to the teeth. Everybody's got a gun drawn, and everybody's yelling to calm down and back off. Finally, Jane, in a terrible alpha dog voice, claims rank with her FBI status and tells everybody to put weapons away. But then a guy with what appears to be an auto open fire from inside where the guy who actually raped the girl is, and all hell breaks loose, with bullets flying everywhere, Star-Trek guys and Tribal cop get killed, but Jane survives, aided by Hurt Locker/Hawkeye, who then exacts your desired blood lust revenge by making bad guy run in snow until he dies, which ends up being a hundred feet and well short of the dead girl's six mile run in the snow, which, I think, is supposed to show us how tough she was? Ug. Awful, awful stuff. Had a chance to be very good, then made the critical mistake of going to what they probably believed were tried-and-true tropes, which did not fit the story at all.Also, a bunch of guys beating their friend to death because he wouldn't let them molest his girl seems very far fetched.Just not good.EDITED TO ADD - sound track may have been the worst sound track I've every experienced as a movie goer. Did not fit the scenes. Awful.",3,98,223,7 September 2017
The Big Lebowski," Biggest Movie Disappointment of My Life
","I like non-main stream flicks - Blue Velvet, Boxing Helena, and so on. I like comedy that is not dependent on stupid sight gags or scatological humor. This movie had been out for a few years before I watched it. It was, I had heard, a gem that was waiting for me. I had looked forward to it greatly.I didn't find any aspect of the movie funny, other than the enigma that it's well liked by many.I suppose this is where I differ from most - I don't find a guy walking around with a mixed drink all the time funny. I don't find Dan Conner overreaching as a guy who is a Vietnam vet freaking out about anything funny, particularly because that's been done before. I don't find the Italian guy acting fooling while bowling to be funny. I don't find referencing a guy as 'the dude,' with article obligatory, to be funny. And on and on. What's funny? Dennis Miller. He's funny. George Carlin. He's funny. The Big Lebowski - not funny.I really don't have any comment on the ins and outs of the movie. Just not funny, and, given that it's a comedy, that, to me, is a fatal mistake.",1,196,378,5 March 2011
Looper," If you don't think too hard, it's okay, otherwise . . .
","I gave this movie a 5 because I was entertained. But I was trying really, really hard to be entertained, and I wanted to be entertained. Had I been in a more dour mood, I would have dislike this movie.SPOILERS BELOWThe main problem I have with this movie is that the story takes too many liberties with common sense. If you are going to watch a time travel movie, you are going to have to shelve some questions, no doubt. But this movie asks you to leave too many basic questions unanswered.Such as:Why is it so hard for the future mob to get rid of bodies? If it's hard for the future mob to get rid of bodies, why did they shoot Old Joe's wife? Particularly given that she was simply walking around and was not a threat? And further given that they had a future stun-gun device in their hands that could have immobilized her? Why not kill the victims before sending them back? You'd hope by 2074 they'd have a lethal method of killing people that didn't shed blood. I mean, they have flying motorcycles in 2044, and a time machine in 2074, so surely they would have a quick way of zapping people. In 2012 we can't even make an affordable EV, but we have flying motorcycles just 32 years later? If the future mob has the precision to send people back to the exact spot in a cornfield, why not send them back to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean? Or the North Pole? Or a volcano? Or 1 mile under the Pacific? Or New Jersey? Why, exactly, is it a problem for 'loopers' to be alive in the future? If loopers know that they are going to be captured and returned in 30 years, why are they sleeping in bed with their wives? You've had 30 years to prep. Why does young Joe have attached ear lobes (cat's ears) but old Joe has ear lobes? ;) Gold is preposterously heavy. How does old Joe move around so easily with what amounts to several hundred pounds of gold on his back? Why not send the older loopers back to be killed by loopers who aren't them? They clearly have no issue shooting strangers. How does a major crime boss from the future leave himself open to having old Joe shoot and blow up everybody and every thing in 5 minutes? There are many others - those are just the obvious ones.This movie was not clever. It was anything but clever, in fact. But, if you don't ask too many questions, as the movie implores, you might be able to eek a bit of enjoyment out of it.By the way - the movie was more gruesome than it needed to be. I felt a bit guilty watching the violence.",5,5,11,10 October 2012
