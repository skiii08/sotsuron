The Incredible Hulk," A Movie to be Forgotten
","As a major superhero movie fan, I've got to say this movie was just, OK. Out of all of the back up movies to The Avengers (Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Captain America, and Thor) this one was the one that did the lest for me. It may just be because I'm not a huge Hulk fan, but it really didn't do much for me. This movie starts out with Bruce Banner in Brazil trying to learn how to control his heart rate so that he doesn't turn into the Hulk again. But of course this fails so he goes back home in hopes to find data to give to a mysterious 'Mr. Blue' who is trying to help him find a cure. Along the way he meets up with his ex-girlfriend who still loves him and runs off to help him. There are a lot of battle scenes with The Hulk, and the U.S. army who are trying to bring him in so that they can create an army of Hulks. The only scene that is really memorable, however, is the one at the end battle between The Hulk, and The Abomination. Everything before that is just OK. This movie IS worth seeing. It is NOT a horrible movie. I just wouldn't ever buy it for any reason, but to complete the collection of the whole before Avengers series.",6,3,4,20 June 2012
Batman Returns," Disturbingly Depressing.
","Batman Returns was a major disappointment to me. When I saw the first Batman in this series, I loved it (mostly due to Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker). The thing about these original Batman movies is that they put the majority of the focus on the villains. The Joker was a complete show maker in the last one, but this one includes Danny DeVito as the Penguin, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat Woman. While both actors did a good job, the two different stories of the Penguin and Cat Woman did not make a good combination. The Penguins story was depressing which added gloom to the story, and Cat Woman's story was disturbing which added darkness to the story. Put them together and you have a movie that's disturbingly depressing (or Depressingly Disturbing which ever you prefer.) Batman himself was played for the last time by Michael Keaton. A lot of people were mad when Keaton didn't return in the last two films for this series but personally I was OK with it. It's not that I think that he's a bad actor, as much as I think that he wasn't a convincing Batman (he doesn't look the part for starters). The rest of the acting was good. Particularly Christopher Walken as Max. He did a great job. I just don't think that a movie that doubles up on negative emotions is a good way to get buyers. And so thus, after one successful movie, the Batman franchise began to fail.",5,1,5,14 May 2013
Alice in Wonderland," Well done, but not my style
","Alice in Wonderland was never one of my favorite Disney movies growing up, and I'm not particularly fond of Tim Burton's movies either. So why did I watch this movie twice? The first time was because I was curious, and the second time was because I didn't know what I thought the first time. Overall I would now say that this movie was very well done in it's own dark, weird way. Johnny Depp did his usual fantastic job at being a likable weirdo as the mad hatter, Helena Bonham Carter was wonderful as the deeply messed up Red Queen, and Anne Hathaway (although she had a much smaller part)was amusing to watch as the sweet,peaceful White Queen. The rest of the acting was fine, but those three were definitely the ones that stole the show. The various creatures in the show looked good, and the scenery was beautiful. Despite all of these benefits however I still can't honestly say that I liked this movie. I enjoyed it, and would never go as far as to say that it is a waste of time to see, but it just isn't my kind of movie.",6,1,2,11 May 2013
