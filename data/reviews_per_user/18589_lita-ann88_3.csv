Hereditary," Hereditary, storyline explanation below:
","This movie is a horror masterpiece! Let me break it down for those who can't figure it out or find it hard to understand. I think this is a large part of the hate, because it can be a difficult story to wrap your head around:Anne (the mother) states that one of her brothers starved himself to death, the other hung himself. She also says to her son (while sleepwalking) that she didn't want a son and tried to miscarry but couldn't.The grandmother, had tried to put Paimon (one of the kings of hell) into her sons. But they would have rather died and did so.Anne states that she would not let her mother near her son, as they were not speaking at the time. But out of guilt as her mother was getting older and senile, she let her nurse her daughter.The grandmother took advantage of having access to her granddaughter and out of desperation put Paimon (the king of hell) into her gran daughter.The grandmother caused the death of her granddaughter to then use her in the afterlife to get to her grandson. The fact that she is decapitated proves this theory, as her mother and father are also decapitated in the end. It is symbolic.Her grandson is supposed to be the rightful air to Paimon. In the grandmothers books it states 'Paimon must be in the body of a man to be strong'Grandmother could only get to her grandson, after death. Using her satanic cult to do her bidding from beyond the grave.Hope this helped. Watch it again and enjoy!",7,2,4,8 March 2019
The Fast and the Furious," Best of the Series! No question!
","I'm surprised this has one of the lowest ratings of the series!
What makes me love this film above all the others? Well, there's a few things:<ul><li>This is the original, the best! Before Hollywood took it and threw into unrealistic scenarios and laughable over the top action sequences.</li><li>This movie at its core is about friendship and the close bonds the main characters hold for one another. Lengths a person will go to for those they love.</li><li>It keeps things simple, street racing, robbery, fist fights and racial feuds. Why do audiences need cars jumping from high rise to high rise and over the top villains with pointless back stories and agenda's?</li></ul>It's realistic (to a degree) has impressive actor chemistry, makes you care for the characters and their close bonds. Fun storyline, high stress action sequences. You really don't need more to create a great film, if written and executed correctly.On a side note I will say, at this time of his career, Paul Walker, cannot act. Thankfully he improved on his talents as he worked in the series more and more. Which is more than you can say for a lot of 'pretty' men landing high profile film roles in the industry today.10/10 loved it 18years ago and love it still. You cannot beat the classic, the original The Fast & The Furious.",10,1,3,18 January 2019
Inception," Good Film, Not Great
","I think my biggest issue with this film was, to me, the dreams weren't very realistic. In a sense that, when I dream, they're nothing like it is depicted in the film. This annoyed me! The dream sequences are very Hollywood stylized.Don't get my wrong, the acting in this film is superb, with names like Leo Decaprio & Joseph Gordan of course it would be. The special effects are also quite incredible.If you want to watch something that, in my opinion, realistically depicts how we actually dream. Give Joss Wheadon's take on it a look. Its spot on in Buffy The Vampire Slayer - Season 4, Episode 22 : Restess.I gave it a 6 as it is a well written and well executed film. Great if you want to watch something that will make you think long after.",4,0,2,2 November 2014
