The Blair Witch Project," What a waste of money!
","When I went to see Blair Witch, I went with an open mind, some people said it was awful and others really amazing. But I have to admit that it was the most boring piece of sh*t this year, and I thought The Sixth Sense was boring. In fact, Sixth Sense was more scary than Blair Witch ever was. All they did was go into the forest, get lost, kick the map into a river, lose one of their mates, get very scared, end. The ending was totally c**p and it was way to sudden. They go in the house, run up and down some stairs, and bingo they fall over and the movie ends. When I saw the credits come up I exclaimed a mixture of WTF and you have to be f**king kidding! And the whole cinema was thinking along the same lines. That shows how bad it was. Even my drama teacher, who I bumped into at the cinema, thought it was wierd and didn't have a very good ending. And if she thinks it's c**p, then it must be. And throughout the whole film, we could hear DEEP BLUE SEA in the next screen. God, how I wish I had seen that now.",Null,2,3,13 November 1999
American Pie," Brilliant, Just Brilliant!
","I went to see this film with a group of girls and they found this film funny as well as me, but I found it hysterically funny. It just shows that this film caters for all tastes not just the guys of the cinema world. Well I don't think the scene with the girl masturbating would suit some girls tastes! I wouldn't see the film on a date but with a group of mates, it's just perfect.",9,0,0,25 October 1999
