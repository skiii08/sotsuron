Blade Runner 2049," They made a buck, you lost 3 hours of your life
","This movie has more plot holes than Emmental cheese....To begin with, both the author of the original book and the original movie state that the replicants are androids: machines made to the image of humans. Not humans. They had computer brains. The original plot revolved around some of these machines developing more and more sentience - and to rebel. It was one of the very few examples of a movie better than the book. And the whole scenario is sorely dated.The new movie begins by subverting this, calling them 'enslaved humans'. Then the big bad corporation that bought the rights to the project started making them a lot more compliant to their role as slaves. They even put some in the role of blade runner....What is that about an AI hologram that can project without a tether? The main unit remains inside the building and the image is projected far away on the street.....at this point, the AI getting 'wet' and enjoying the 'rain' doesn't even bother anymore....The (slave) android blade runner finds one of his predecessors, a Nexus-8 (same model as the ones that gave Harrison Ford all that trouble decades ago -btw, they keep referring to the androids as 'models' instead of 'breeds', but why pay attention to details, right?). After 'retiring' the farmer droid, our hero finds a buried box. Upon later investigation at the central, this is found to contain the 'mortal' remains of another Nexus-8. A female. And they find out she 'died' at CHILDBIRTH. Childbirth, for crying out loud! As if the original models came equipped with reproductive capacity. So they could reproduce 'in the wild', so to say, effectively ending the corporation's profits. The boss of the new big bad corporation - a cyborg himself - openly says this was Tyrell's design and that the secret was lost...Simply stupid.There is a recurrent mention to Russia - in the form of the USSR, with ads in Russian floating around, the farm where the first Nexus-8 is caught is named in Russian, Russian-speaking 'slave' prostitutes!!! - even in downtown LA, as if the soviets had returned to the steppe. And were in best relations with the USA....In the police building, random signs in both English and Hindi...perhaps they want to indicate that Russians are the rabble, but Hindus are at least up there with middle management....Another droid enters the police station, goes into the evidence room, finds and takes the evidence of the deceased childbearing droid AND kills a cop in the process - all without setting off any alarms or raising any suspicion on the otherwise crowded station.Who the hell gave these morons scientific and technologic advice? The movie supposedly depicts 2049 - 31 years in the future. They have stationary flying humongous trash trucks - but no waste-to-energy tech! Trash is just piled in open-air areas!!!! Naturally, all this trash has to be processed for recycling by hand, by CHILDREN in an orphanage.The wingless police car (basically a flying brick) has no armor, gets shorted out and manages, without power or propulsion, to maneuver. Then, also without power, it uses air breaks to avoid being torn to bits as it crashes. Come on, people....Our hero, so far an apt investigator, gets surrounded by scavengers. Armed ones. When he is about to be overpowered, small missiles fall out of nowhere, attacking his opponents. He makes nothing of it, accepts the heavenly gift and carries on! The missiles, of course, came from the big bad corp, that wants him to find the missing droid child. Bees in the supposedly radioactive area (this one full of Korean characters....). Many hive boxes, filled to the brim with busy bees.....and no plants anywhere....autotroph bees! A miracle!Oh! Not to mention the architecture at the big bad corp's HQ! They wanted to do better than the original movie, so they borrowed the ideas from.....The Incredibles!!! I won't say what happens in the end....as I did, you will watch this crap until the end, just to honor the original movie.",3,9,17,21 February 2018
The Babadook," Avoid at all cost. May cause stupor, dementia or plain stupidity.
","I have seen my share (well, I am a fan of horror movies, so perhaps I've seen more than my share) of crappy movies.This one is a strong contender for the Crappiest Movie Ever.Take a troubled child (been there, seen it), a recently-widowed harrowed mother (dido) and a well-to-do, got-plenty-of-time-on-my- hands evil spirit (duh...). By the way, the this is a homogeneously insufferable, detestable, unruly, almost certainly psychic (duh again) and supposedly traumatized from Daddy's death boy at the height of his 8 years of age.... Sure recipe for at least a half-S'd B-rated horror movie, right?Dead wrong. Not this time. This time they spend your viewing time making sure that, should you have a millionth of a chance, you would do your best to aid the evil spirit and (i) torture the girl's son in front of her - she deserves at least a little compensation.... - and (ii) finish her in the most horrid way imaginable. ASAP. No questions asked.A weak plot is added to one-dimensional characters to produce a lamentable mongrel of a movie....I promised you spoilers. Well, apart from the few details provided above, I'll give you none. If you decide to see this pile of smoking manure, you deserve to be as bored, as annoyed and as enraged as I was.DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE",1,11,26,21 April 2015
A Quiet Place," People can't write dystopian catastrophe scenarios anymore....
","Beautiful scenery and atmosphere. Yup, that's pretty much it about this movie.There are now unbelievably fast monsters on Earth. They are blind, but have bat-like abilities to avoid standing obstacles in their hunting path. They have idiosyncratic hearing: typical sounds a hunting creature would search for are easily ignored, but accidental ones are heard from a kilometer away. Oh, they have idiosyncratic natural armour too: enough to wipe out the military but just fragile enough to allow them to be killed with a headshot when the 'plot' would benefit from it....So, the world is in shambles, monsters roam the fields but, mom, what's for dinner? Why, dear, we have bread! 'Cause the friendly monsters do not impede heavy machinery to work the earth to keep producing wheat, corn....and processing them into flour, naturally! They are only concerned when you sneeze. THEN it's hunting time!!!A good thing is that dad, a farmer, can turn himself around into a hearing aid technician to repair his deaf daughter's faulty one. Such a capable daddy! It is a pity that, with all that newly found knowledge, he doesn't think of making a soundproof area in their home - and there is a subterranean room just asking for that.....also, a few traps with sound wouldn't be bad....right, daddy? After all, for some reason, there is still electricity to spare....and natural armour doesn't keep THAT away...but, alas...another idiosyncrasy....they have electricity BUT use plenty of candles and oil lamps....buuuuut can't figure out an explosive trap....The river provides a sound mask....so why not create a louder sound mask and be able to again talk freely? Better yet, drive the monsters insane with targeted sound?Oh, honourable mention: as of late, girls are always brave rebels and boys can only be sweet/frightened/dumb/plain stupid.And then we come to the nail on the stairway...once it gets up, NOBODY thinks of putting it back down or pulling it off. It is allowed to stay there and wreak havoc, as it eventually does....Well, anyway...you've been warned....only watch it if you have the attention span of a 5 year old. Then perhaps you won't notice all the holes and stupidity. But, then again, you wouldn't have read all the way through my little diatribe...",2,9,16,30 May 2018
