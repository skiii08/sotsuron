50 First Dates," romanticizing tough condition works for Sandler
","This movie is one of Mr. Sandler's glimmering jewels among dead weight rocks. In my opinion it ranks up there with The Wedding Singer, also co starring Drew Barrymore. Maybe its her characters' innocent charm that brings out Sandlers better, romantic side. The problem for me comes with way they romanticize the situation. Many married people split after one of them goes through the trauma Lucy has, and yet according to the movie, it is appealing to have to get your lover up to speed every day of their life. I admire the person that can do that, and only the best of wishes for those like Henry who know what lies ahead of them and they still make that commitment. But in reality, its not so exciting and uplifting. In that respect, it is good of them to have Lucy feel like she is inconveniencing Henry. The scenery is beautiful, the editing/styling on segments like the pineapple intro and crash scene were marvelous; really displaying what the company's/producers are capable of producing. aside from the 'birdies' (not including the penguin), the film is incredible! i love it!",8,0,0,13 February 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Do not eat chocolate cake
","Wow. a cornicopia of visual tantalizements. a whole lot of wow. and, sadly a lot of sex. Being mature(r) i can over look these things, but every time neo and trin see each other, you know. But the movie is incredible funny. the sex is part of it. but things like the chocolate cake is uncool and unnecessary. There is also this 5 minute dancing/sexing scene that is very interesting cause the music and movement capture you. the photography used here is used very well, although the subject matter is not as applaudable. But yes, many non sex funnies too. mostly apparent statements, or actions. Nonstop 'lookatmeness', except during a speech by morpheus, but even then they play readying action shots that bide you through. i really loved it and plan to see it several times. but i will warn you, many people complained about the way Lord of the Rings ended, this is worse. Commenter next to me said emphatically 'God D@mn it!'...::waiting for revolution::..",Null,0,0,14 May 2003
