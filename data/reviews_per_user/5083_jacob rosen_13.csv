Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Surprisingly Entertaining
","Perhaps it was George Lucas's return to the helm, but this installment of the `Star Wars' saga is surprisingly entertaining, working as an interesting saga and not merely as backstory to the legendary trilogy. It's certainly far superior to the sequels of the original, neither of which Lucas directed. There's more of a focus on the characters here than in the previous films (Lucas brings in a heavyweight in Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor has already established himself as an actor of some repute) but there's plenty of attention to detail and the look of the film itself is a dense, roving kaleidoscope with an emphasis on the burnished browns and dark reds that may be an influence from Kurosawa's color films. (Indeed the concept of `Star Wars' itself seems directly influenced by Kurosawa.) Some of the action sequences, such as the pod race that is the centerpiece of the film, may seem overly familiar but they're deftly handled and exciting nonetheless. Lucas is clearly in love with chivalry and his fight scenes are filled with motivations of honor, dignity and justice. With the exception of the contemptuously annoying Jar Jar Binks (it's hard to get past the implications his character represents), there's a lot to admire here and it's greatly appreciated.",9,7,10,5 January 2002
Citizen Kane," As If It Were Made Yesterday
","Orson Welles' indisputable masterpiece has a modernity that shocks you upon viewing: it could have been made yesterday, it seems that contemporary. It has innovation writ large all over it, from Gregg Toland's deep focus cinematography to Bernard Herrmann's moody score to the natural interplay of the performers (especially Welles with his wonderfully modulated voice) and it never flags, not even for a minute. The screenplay, by Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz, is a model of perfection, cutting, as it does, through a life as seen through the eyes of those who knew Charles Foster Kane at various points. All in all, it's impossible to conceive improving upon what is quite possibly the greatest, most influential film ever made.",10,0,1,16 October 2001
Memento," Clever but Taxing
","Christopher Nolan's modern-day noir concerns a man (Guy Pearce) trying to uncover his wife's killers while struggling with short-term memory loss. Since his hero is also the narrator, it's a tricky narrative; but Nolan complicates things even further by unfolding the story backwards. The result is clever but it's also taxing: your mind has to work harder than it necessarily should. Once the novelty wears off, there are plenty of dead spots and impatience sets in--you want to get to the beginning to get a feeling of completion. The result is like watching a big-screen version of `Columbo' where you know the killer at the onset and watch Peter Falk figure out whodunit and why. If that's your cup of tea, this is for you. Pearce is excellent, as usual; also starring is Joe Pantoliano (a pleasure) and an underused Carrie-Anne Moss.",6,1,2,21 September 2001
Bridget Jones's Diary," Phony
","Renee Zellweger's ludicrous British accent is only one of the outrages perpetrated in Sharon Maguire's film of the Helen Fielding bestseller about the life and loves of a thirty-something single woman. This is a film that could set the feminist cause back thirty years with its shamelessly aggressive belief that women have careers only to make themselves more available to men and that life isn't worth living if Mr. Right doesn't come along. Zellweger spends the entire film trying to convince us she's got the accent down but she's only a caricature--and a blank one at that. Maguire, meanwhile, spends just as much effort trying to convince us that a natural beauty like Zellweger is fat and plain--it's a sham (much like Janeane Garafolo is in `The Truth About Cats & Dogs'). The rest of the cast is uninspired; even the dependable Hugh Grant, trying to play against type as a cad, barely registers a pulse and Colin Firth, as Mr. Right, is curiously unlikable. The script (by Fielding and two other-male-writers) is shallow and tedious.",1,6,12,27 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Astonishing
","Peter Jackson is perhaps the only director with a vision expansive enough to create the enveloping world that comprises J.R.R. Tolkien's epic. (After all, his excellent `Heavenly Creatures' concerned two teenage girls so entrenched in a world of medieval chivalry and battle that they resort to murder to keep in intact.) Here, Jackson's world is so thorough that it not only encompasses the earth most of the action takes place on but also an underworld and (especially) every available inch of sky. It's enormous. Structures rise for what seem like miles into the air (the production design is by Grant Major, who also did `Heavenly Creatures' and Jackson's enjoyable horror-comedy `The Frighteners') and Andrew Lesnies's swooping camera frequently gives you a bird's eye-view of all levels of action. And what action! Definitely not for children under nine, intense battles that last for several minutes apiece feature creatures that are among the most disturbing personifications of evil you may ever see. The sense of despair they provide is palpable and exhausting. Jackson uses all the powers of his imagination to create what is clearly an hommage to Tolkien, but there's also a gleeful indulgence in honoring his favorite filmmakers; there are references too numerous to mention but the tribute to the German expressionists of the silent era is vivid and delightful (and scary). The film's scope dwarfs Tolkien's characters but perhaps that's the point: the immense struggle between good and evil is bigger than any character can carry (and there are few shades of gray presented here) and although the outcome seems predictable the struggle itself is awesome, biblical, profound. The acting is fine, especially Ian McKellan as Gandalf the Grey and Viggo Mortensen as Strider but Jackson could have had everyone reading the phone book and the result would have been the same. This will surely go down in the annals of film making as one of the finest examples of film fantasy ever created. The special effects are completely convincing; you've definitely seen bigger budgets that haven't been used this well. I feel like an idiot gushing as I do but I can't help it--it's that good.",10,0,0,20 December 2001
Slap Shot," A Hill/Newman Masterpiece
","An original, expertly crafted comedy from the underrated George Roy Hill. Paul Newman plays the captain of an inept semi-professional hockey team trying to stay afloat in a dying industrial town; when the team adds a trio of blood-seeking brothers (alone worth the price of admission), the team's notoriety catches fire with the depressed community. Hill captures this with a flat, no frills, documentary-like style and with Newman's intuitive ability to play on his aging charm, the film is absolutely convincing in its detail. Newman's contribution to cinema cannot be overstated: as an actor growing his immense talent through his beauty, he has given us insight into our preoccupation with our ideals of the American physique throughout its lifespan. He insists that aging has its grace and comedy and he's ruthless when it comes to examining himself. Hill also deserves credit for presenting Nancy Dowd's well-written screenplay directly and with a sense of timing that causes you to double over with laughter even as you're affected by the characters' plights. A masterpiece that underneath its knowing smirk lies a sense of childlike innocence in presenting things as seen, without embellishment.",10,0,4,3 August 2001
Mulholland Drive," Captivatingly Pointless
","Though it's far more coherent than its predecessor `Lost Highways', David Lynch is beginning to show signs of repetition and this noir fantasy-nightmare is so reminiscent of other Lynch films that it ends up signifying nothing. Still, nobody does David Lynch better than Lynch: he's an artist when it comes to evoking dread and the film is never less than morbidly fascinating. There's very little point in going over the plot because it's far more of a mood piece than anything else; suffice it to say the primary issue here (much like `Lost Highways') is shifting identities. To that end, the characters are blank though gorgeous. Worth seeing as long as you recognize you're spinning your wheels.",7,2,4,22 December 2001
Annie Hall," Warm, Loose And Funny
","Woody Allen's breakthrough as a filmmaker is a loose, episodic look at a modern relationship and it combines the best of Allen' earlier films with a melancholia that would turn exceedingly dour in his later work. It's aided immeasurably by the winning Diane Keaton in the title role; she's fresh and funny and although the story is not told in a linear fashion, you can see her maturation and self-determination as the film progresses. Much can be made about Allen's vindictive treatment of women (and, in his later films, there's plenty of justification to criticize his views) but it should be noted than Allen skewers plenty of men here, most notably himself; he's always castigated himself in order to elicit your pity but this time there's a self-flagellation that seems hard, unforgiving and realistic. He also manages to make this one of his funniest films: many of the lines (by Allen and Marshall Brickman) are unforgettable. After `Manhattan' Allen's consistency would dry up (he apparently never recovered from `Interiors' and `Stardust Memories') but here his talents are in full bloom.",10,0,0,17 August 2001
Blow," Depp Shines
","Johnny Depp delivers another steel-eyed performance that raises Ted Demme's morality tale to be the best it can be--which is to say not a whole lot. Based on a true story, Depp plays George Jung, an honest, likable drug smuggler who wants nothing more than to live the American dream and finds himself skilled at his profession; he's done in by a cruel, cold world that he fails to ever understand. Depp is quietly lyrical, infusing his character with a shimmering fluidity that allows him to fade into the background whenever the scene demands something larger--he's nothing if not an expert team player. Unfortunately, Demme is too obsessed with paying homage to Martin Scorsese to care and the film as a whole feels recycled from `GoodFellas'. Also starring is Penelope Cruz, good in a limited but crucial role as Jung's wife.",6,0,0,5 October 2001
The Deer Hunter," Comes Close
","Michael Cimino's ambitious goal of creating an epic about the impact of the Vietnam War on ordinary civilians falls a little short of its goal--Cimino's attempts at creating mythology through his characters doesn't have as much substance as it would appear on the surface and a lot of the moments aimed at reflection seem empty; on a larger scale, there might be some trouble understanding what it all means. But when Cimino concentrates on the smaller, intimate interpersonal relationships--of which there are many--he succeeds brilliantly and the anguish of the war's aftereffects are clear, keenly felt and far more engrossing. Robert DeNiro heads an ensemble cast that includes Meryl Streep, John Heard, Christopher Walken and the sorely missed John Cazale; they do justice to the script (by Cimino and three other writers) even when it shows its limitations. The middle section is a justly celebrated Russian roulette game played in a makeshift POW camp; while it underscores the unfortunate aspects of the screenplay, it is a harrowing experience that makes the performances that much more powerful. It could have been shorter but it is still a worthwhile experience, if not quite the masterpiece it was intended to be.",9,1,2,14 December 2001
The Birds," Two Films
","Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of the famous Daphne DuMaurier novella is really two films: the first hour sets up a flirtation between rambunctious socialite Tippi Hedren and conservative attorney Rod Taylor; the second hour throws the construction aside to concentrate on random attacks on a small California village by flocks of wild birds. Of course, as with Hitchcock, nothing is unnecessary and the relationship between Hedren and Taylor becomes a family unit in order to rescue unity from chaos. Hitchcock's worldview is extremely dour here (everyone--even children--are subjects of graphic torture) and the conclusion suggests a slow impending doom--it's extremely upsetting to say the least. The first hour, however, is talky and dull. There is no musical score but Bernard Herrmann does have a hand in the sound. Disney pioneer Ub Iwerks is listed as a `Special Photographic Advisor'.",6,1,2,25 October 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," An Amiable Ramble
","A surprisingly entertaining comedy from the Coen brothers, who attempt to place Homer's `Odyssey' in the Depression-era Deep South. Maybe because they spend so much time focusing on getting the retelling right there's very little of the cold condescension towards the characters that mars most of their other films. (Not that there's a whole lot of warmth either; the Coen brothers don't seem capable of empathizing with people and many of the characters are present only to serve as comic relief.) There's also a rhythm that makes the film a very pleasant ramble, abetted by T-Bone Burnett's bluesy score and Roger Deakins' dusty, deep woods photography. The three convicts who escape from a chain gang and wander in search of home and family are played by Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro (both very likable) and are anchored by George Clooney (passable but he does try). The large cast also includes Coen stalwarts John Goodman (as the Cyclops), Holly Hunter and Charles Durning. The title is a typical Coen film school in-joke, referencing Preston Sturges' `Sullivan's Travels'.",8,0,0,20 October 2001
The Godfather," An Icon
","At once an observant homage to crime films of the Thirties and Forties and a loving portrait of an Italian-American family, Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's superlative novel (Puzo also co-write the script) is an achievement few films can hope to approximate. Coppola, along with his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, and his production designer, Dear Tavoularis, have created a history wholly realized, burnished brown as if a memory that will never completely fade. The world of the Cosa Nostra they present is closed and stuffy which provides an intimacy that generates an extraordinary amount of warmth and a feeling of lives being affected. The cast is flawless: the actors, to a person, inhabit the characters with such understanding and affection that they will be forever associated with them. (Al Pacino as Michael in the trilogy will never be able to match this work elsewhere.) But it is Marlon Brando in the title role that delivers such devastating work that you can only sit and stare in wonderment. Brando has a presence wise beyond his years and his gentle, thoughtful manner is never once betrayed his calculating, violent acts. Every movement, every vocal inflection is detailed and planned but he offers a spontaneity that never reveals technique. Guided by Coppola's abiding dedication to realism, Brando pushes this film to icon status. Not to be missed.",10,0,1,7 December 2001
