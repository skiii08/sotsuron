Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If I had never seen a Star Wars movie, this would be a classic.
","I am not a hardcore SW fan, but I have always loved the classic trilogy, and I was anxious to see TPM.  I avoided the spoilers as much as possible, and therefore some of the movie's surprises were kept pristine for me.  What I saw, however, disappointed me.  If I had never before seen a SW movie, this film would be an instant classic.  I think that George Lucas tried to push too much information into the film.  Most of the scenes without action feel forced and rushed.  It becomes far too easy for the casual viewer to ignore the plot and focus on the eye candy.  We really don't get much of a feel for the characters, which is a pity.  Some of them could have been truly fascinating.  As for the Jar Jar Binks controversy, I think that he is evidence that the series has wandered too far into being a kids movie. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but with TPM, it seems to force the plot even further into the background.  However, don't think this is a bad film.  For a SW fan, it's a terrific film filled with surprises for the discerning viewer.  For the casual viewer, it is a spectacle filled with some of the best visual effects *EVER*.  And, I might add, the lightsaber duels are fantastic.  The final one is perhaps the best fight scene in film history. Overall, I enjoyed TPM, and hope that with so much info crammed into Episode I, Episodes 2 and 3 will be able to expand the characters and story to do justice to the classic trilogy.",8,0,0,26 June 1999
