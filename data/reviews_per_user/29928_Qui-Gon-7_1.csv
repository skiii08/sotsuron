The Blair Witch Project," Stunning & Thrilling
","I was fortunate to see this brilliant film the day after it's limited release opening on July 17th at the Main Art Theater in Royal Oak, Michigan. It's incredible.  The directors of this film prove that fancy cameras, high-paid actors, and overblown budgets cannot replace horrifying simplicity of sheer psychological terror.  It's unfortunate to think that many will see this film after TV advertising has started, and most major media will have revealed that this is a 'mockumentary' not a documentary.  There is an added chill to seeing the film when there is the thought that these events may have actually happened.  No matter what your prior knowledge, see this film.",9,1,1,22 July 1999
