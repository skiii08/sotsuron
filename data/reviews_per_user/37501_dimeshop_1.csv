Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A wonderful experience, this movie is.
","This movie is truly great.  It is comparable to the original triology in special effects innovation, humor, adventure, mystery, characters, etc. yet still not any more derivative than a story so closely linked to the originals could be.  I loved the chance to experience a new star wars movie while it was still new.  The energy surrounding this film is contagious and I urge you all to go see it.",10,0,0,23 May 1999
