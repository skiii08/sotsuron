Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great visuals, not-so-great acting
","I'm rewatching this movie for the first time since I was a child. The visuals and story are awesome, but the acting is the opposite. The CGI animations have much more expression than the human actors do. It feels like they were cued to just say their lines and not put much effort into their characters/emotions. I'm halfway into the movie, and it's not nearly as good as I reminisced about before watching it again. Most of the acting kind of kills it for me.",6,0,1,13 November 2019
The Hateful Eight," Very involving!
","Now, I'm not writing this review to be 'helpful'. I'm just voicing my opinion on it as a whole. I stumbled upon this title on Netflix with hardly any knowledge of it, the actors involved, or even its plot. The beginning was somewhat strange, but the setting was somewhat immersive to me, so I stuck with watching it. As the plot thickened and the characters became more involved with each other, I found it kind of hard to get out of my seat for the nearly 3 hours that the movie was on.The suspenseful events that unfold during the movie (especially when it came down to the mystery aspect) really kept my mind focused, and got me involved with the character portrayal and each of their roles in this tiny cabin that most of it takes part in. The gruesome and 'expected-but-unexpected' things that happen during this film didn't distract me from the rest of the plot, and kept engaged and focusing on what would happen next. I will say that if you're just looking for a shoot-em-up western that involves a team of heroes, this is not a movie meant for you. If you can grasp hold of what's going on in the film and take the tiny details into consideration given the fact that it's a mystery that revolves heavily around the characters, I think you'll like the movie.",9,0,1,23 July 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Design, great. Character portrayal, not so much.
","I didn't bother to see this movie in theaters, because live action movies don't exactly have the best reputation for being as good as their original cartoon versions. Now, I watched the live action not knowing what to expect. I hadn't paid much attention to the trailers, and hadn't heard anything from friends about the movie. However, I was sort of expecting something different from what I'd seen in the original, with the movie having had such a wide budget.During the first scene in the movie, I could tell right away that this was just going to be an attempt at a copy of the original. Emma Watson (playing Belle) walked down steps into town just as Belle did in the original film. She began singing, and you could hear the terrible auto-tuning right away. It was not pleasant, and sounded way too electronic to stack up to the original. All of the other songs' auto-tuning was highly noticeable as well. There didn't seem to be much life in Emma Watson's character portrayal, as well as many of the others'. Not a great way to kick off a movie.The movie gets rather boring, to the point where I stopped paying attention to it many times. I had thought that there were going to be more comedic elements between the characters in the film. If there were, they weren't noticeable. It seemed to have a much more serious tone to it than the original that I didn't expect from a Disney film.Some of the character designs were rather strange; especially Mrs. Pott's. Chip could've added more comedy to the film, but he wasn't featured very much at all. I will say, that like many other reviews, my favorite character design/portrayal was that of Gaston's. I think that went over well since the movie was so serious, and his original tone was a serious one.Now, not all of it was bad. If you're going for a romantic movie that holds a serious undertone, this is a good one to see. a lot of the scenery is great, and the castle design is wonderful, and the music without the auto-tuning was spectacular. Overall, it wasn't the worst movie I'd seen. It just wasn't what I was expecting. In my opinion, the characters are supposed to make the movie, and that was just kind of flat in this one.",4,0,0,3 July 2018
