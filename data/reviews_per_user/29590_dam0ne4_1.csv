The Ring," Creepy, but a little confused (Mild spoilers)
","I watched this movie late at night, all the lights out, in my old apartment building (with it's usual creaking noises)  This movie really freaked me out.  It's not your typical horror movie and any movie with evil children is usually scary. But as many other viewers already commented, there were some plot holes/things I didn't get.  Like how did the little boy talk to the girl? How did the copying the tape make you safe?  How did the little girl make the tape in the first place?  Why was it so bad that Rachel set her free, she was going to kill people either way...Bottom line was, I really enjoyed it, it was creepy.",9,0,0,23 October 2003
